       Of Montreal   I recently got back from a 2 1/2 day trip to Montreal to visit Liz (and, to a lesser extent, Melissa and Alex). It was a much-needed break from work and life and grad school applications. If I wanted to go to Concordia before, my desire has quadrupled after my visit to the possible-city-of-my-future. Here's why Montreal is cool:  -beautiful old architecture -more delis and cafes per block than would ever be neccessary -beer bongs -freakishly attractive, well-dressed people  everywhere  -French signs, French menus, French bookstores - years spent in French immersion started to come back to me (but only a little) -Chuchai -I know at least FOUR people who live there. That's DOUBLE the amount of people I know in Toronto! -just a cool vibe, all-around  In other news, I'm a legitimate urlLink  music critic  all of a sudden.   How in the hell did I wind up in the company of Nicholas Jennings, Howie Druckman, Ben Rayner and Bill Welychka, you may ask? I believe it is a combination of sheer dumb luck and my rare gift for making people believe that I know far more about music than I actually do.

       Five Easy Steps to Illicitly Acquiring an ISIC Card for Fun and Profit    Step One:    Leave your moral scruples at the door. Justify your actions by telling yourself that train tickets are incredibly inflated. Anyway, you are just as poor as most students and VIA is a huge, faceless corporation that won't miss a few dollars here or there. This is a victimless crime. Proceed with confidence to step two.    Step Two:    Approach the VIA counter at Union Station (not during peak times), avoiding elderly and female attendants. Select a slightly balding man in his thirties or forties who gives off an air of disappointment with life and love. This man should be old enough to feel some paternal sensations when conversing with you, but he should still be young enough that the thought of having sex with you crosses his mind. Be sure to come in straight from the cold so your cheeks are gently flushed. Think - J. Crew Catalogue! Wear a bohemian-looking knitted hat and a toss a scarf jauntily about your neck. Apply lip gloss at this crucial stage.    Step Three:    Sweetly (but not TOO sweetly. We don't want to sound suspicious or attract any attention, do we?) ask, "Hi, can I get an ISIC card?" He will say "Yes".    Step Four:    Hand over $16 and an ever-so-slightly weathered Queen's Student Card (weathered enough that the dates on the validation sticker have completely rubbed off, but not so weathered that the card appears old). Fill out the application form with a friend's address (thanks, Carolyn!), your old phone number, and your qlink email address, whether or not it is still active. Proceed to final step.    Step Five:    On the line where it says, "I validate that all of the information above is true and accurate" grit your teeth slightly. Revisit Step One, if need be. Sign your name. Exhale.    Step Six (optional):    Gloat.   (Now playing: "Debaser", The Pixies)

       Death At One's Elbow   A man at work died a couple of days ago. His desk was sort of diagonal to mine, and although we'd only ever exchanged 20 words to each other (it's hard to talk to co-workers when we're all constantly on the phones), I found him to be very nice. He wasn't that old, either - maybe 50 or 55? He wore a baseball cap and worked full-time and his name was John. Maybe he had a wife. Maybe kids. I'm not sure. But that's essentially everything I knew about him.  The manager sent an email, informing us that he had passed away. What's saddest about this whole situation is how normal everything was after that. No one seemed visibly upset, the admin lady chipperly ordered flowers to send to the funeral, and  somebody sat in his desk . I thought there'd be a grace period of a week at least before someone moved in, but it was pretty much instantaneous.   I've never experienced death in a work environment. When someone died in public school or at university, it was a huge production. Flags were lowered, flowers and cards were laid, speeches were given at memorial services, balloons were released, poems were written. If you didn't know the person personally (and I did on more than a couple of occasions), you knew someone who did know them, and it would always be a really sombering experience. It reminded us that we are all going to die someday, and just because we're not 86 and bed-ridden, we could still go at any time.  Maybe - like me - people at work were sad on the inside and being normal office-zombies on the outside. I'd like to believe that.  All I know is that I don't want my death to be announced via an inter-office email memo.  I'm so sorry, John.  (Now playing: "Picture Me Big Time", Guided By Voices)

       ...And Get a Real Job   I got a haircut today. My first in three months. I usually get it cut more often than that, but in October I somehow wound up paying $70 (!!!) for one without my knowledge or permission. I am the type of person who will not spend $70 on anything - shoes, jeans, a sweater, rent - so you can imagine how appalled I was. Therefore, I decided to wait as long as possible before getting another one. That haircut still works out to costing me just under $25 per month, though.  Today's haircut was much cheaper, and it's pretty cute, I think. It's shorter than it's been in a long long time and I look a bit like a lesbian, but that is essentially the story of my life so I'll deal with it. Hairdressers have a tendency towards blowdrying, round-brushing and hairspraying my hair until I resemble a Power Puff girl. Today was no exception, but all was well and good after I went home and washed out the suck.  This afternoon I went to Chart and interviewed Jose Contreras from By Divine Right, a band that I have loved for many years in its many incarnations. Super nice guy, that Jose Contreras. BDR just got back from a tour of China, and he had some fun anecdotes to share. I may post an excerpt of the interview when I get around to transcribing it. Also, I may not. On an unrelated note, I suspect he was maybe a little bit high.  Finally couriered my application to Concordia's Graduate Journalism program, after a couple of snags and a small-scale nervous breakdown. (I pity/applaud anyone stupid/brave enough to apply to grad school while still in school.) One down...  (Now playing: "French Diplomacy", Boy)

       Here I Go Again   I don't know why I've attempted another blog. The last one got eaten because I refused to pay for it (if you're at all curious, you can find remnants of it  urlLink here ) and the one before that I just kind of forgot about after a little while. Yet there's something inside of me that is urging me to document my mundane existence, so hell, let's just run with it.  Had a lovely, low-key little New Year's Eve in Kingston with Rob, Lindsay, Jenny, Kem, Robin, Mitch, Jo, etc. Spent the better part of the evening drinking cheap wine, eating chocolate fondue, and making sardonic remarks about the retro videos being showcased on Muchmusic. Which was a relief, because I almost always find NYE to be as stressful as Christmas (and this year was no exception. Something about the anniverary of the birth of Jesus causes my extended family to loudly squabble about politics. It's really fun.)  I didn't plan on making any new year's resolutions, but Daphna has resolved to be a hotter Daphna in 2004 - I may join her and strive to be The Hottest Sofi I Can Be. Oh. And maybe I'll, like, recycle more and help orphans and stuff.  (Now playing: "Rebel Radios", The Wooden Stars)

       Don't Cry   I've been weirdly emotional lately. Mostly in the past month or so. I'm not sure if it's hormonal or what, but it's kind of irritating. To clarify: not emotional as in "my life is an emotional rollercoaster" or anything. I just cry all the damned time about stupid stupid shit - sometimes in public - and it's getting kind of embarrassing.  Here are some things that have set me off recently:     this tiny baby on the subway today who regarded me silently and with such wisdom - it was overwhelming and I had to choke back tears.   the ending of Lost in Translation. The first thing I said when the credits rolled was, "That was SO sad!" and just about lost it. But then Rob said, "No, it wasn't," and I felt instantly dumb and dramatic and swallowed the big giant lump in my throat to save face. Because I cannot let him believe that I am anything less than macho.    my grandmother's stories about her life before, during and after the war (okay, tears are warranted there).   an old bearded busker at Sheppard Station singing James Goddamn Taylor, for Christ's sake! Within 5 bars of "Fire and Rain", I was a blubbering idiot. People were staring!    finally, the most shameful of them all - when Ian proposed to Meredith last night on the finale of The Bachelorette.     I'll understand if you no longer wish to be my friend.  (Now playing: "Where is my Mind?", The Pixies)

       There Are Worse Things in this World   This update is mostly due to popular demand. I haven't done much at all this week, aside from working. Today was my baba's 82nd birthday. She is feisty, funny, entirely of sound mind, entirely independent, and conclusively kick-ass. I only hope to make it to 82 if I am exactly like her in every possible way.  I had my first fitting for my bridesmaid dress on Saturday afternoon. I was a little bit worried about how it would look on me, but it's actually quite nice. It is also the most expensive thing I have EVER worn in life (over $500, $120 of that for alterations alone! Alterations consisting of taking in the straps and hemming the bottom.) I am happy that it is pretty.  Oh! Oh! Oh! I went out this week! Twice! First to Spring Rolls and C'est What with Carolyn mid-week and last night with Alison and (a different) Carolyn to The Fox & The Fiddle and The Stag Shop. The Stag Shop was neat. We examined their collection of massively overpriced vibrators and Alison & Carolyn both decided to test-run pretty lube that the salesgirl told us tasted just like grape juice. (Whoa - I just mentioned my grandmother's birthday in the same post as I mentioned vibes and lube. That's not right, somehow.)  Hmm. Ben has brought it to my attention that I am in a rut. I agree, but it's just so difficult to have an actual life when one a) lives in the suburbs b) does not drive c) lives with one's overprotective European parents and d) has a job with crazy hours that demands waking up at 5:30AM on weekends.   I spent a lot of time mentally preparing myself for the unfunnest year of my life, so it's  really  not as bad as it could be, or even as bad as I had imagined it would be.   Observe:  FADE IN ON - A GREEN AND PINK BEDROOM WITH FLORAL DETAILING, PUNCTUATED BY STUFFED ANIMALS AND PORCELAIN COLLECTOR COUNTRY HATS ON THE WALLS. THIS IS THE SORT OF ROOM A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL OR SIXTY-YEAR-OLD WOMAN MIGHT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN. CUT TO - A YOUNG WOMAN, 23. WEEPING BLOODY TEARS.  YOUNG WOMAN: I'm so lonely! I have no money! And no job! And no future! I'm so entirely screwed! And also, lonely! So lonely! So lonely!  ENTER - PARENTS OF YOUNG WOMAN.  PARENTS: Hi honey. It's 8PM. Past your bedtime! Get to bed like a good girl! YOUNG WOMAN: Yes, mom/dad. PARENTS: Goodnight, darling little one! Don't ever leave us!  PARENTS FLICKS OFF LIGHT SWITCH.  YOUNG WOMAN TURNS ON FLASHLIGHT AND READS "THE BELL JAR" UNDER HER COVERS, SOBBING ALL THE WHILE.  It's only been about 63% that bad. It could be much, much worse.  It's not as if I've been sent off to war.  (Now playing: "Jonathan David", Belle & Sebastian)

       My Funny Valentine   I think it's hilarious that only a couple of days after I wrote  urlLink  this article on DJ Danger Mouse  , Rob got bitchslapped with  urlLink  a cease-and-desist order   of his very own. Making him the coolest person I know right now.  I spent Valentine's Day with a super hot date - my highschool friend Alison. Since her boyfriend was working until 11PM and my boyfriend is inconsiderate enough to live 3 hours away, we decided to sneak some booze into a movie theatre and see Monster. It was very good and very very sad. I'll die of shock if Charlize Theron doesn't win an Oscar for her performance.  If you haven't seen Monster yet, I suggest that you do. I also suggest that you smuggle alcohol into the theatre, and play the Monster Drinking Game. Basically, drink every time a character in the film takes a swig of beer. You'll be tanked before the halfway mark.  I have a gross coldsore (wanna make out?) and am feeling that I am on the verge of sick this week. The other day, I had this insane headache (which I choose to believe was a real live migraine) that hurt so badly that I actually felt nauseous and left work early. I went home and slept for hours and got better, but my health still feels a little bit precarious, overall.  Hey - I have comments enabled now! Leave comments!

       Dressy Bessy   I went dress clothes shopping with my mom today. That's always fun.  Being a jeans-and-sweater girl, dressing up all purdy goes against every grain of my being, but every now and again I can't get away from it. And it honestly never ceases to amaze me at how little my mother knows my style/tastes/personality after being around me for 23 years, give or take.  My mother considers herself to be a professional shopper, and she's quite good at getting great stuff for super cheap. But when it comes to clothing me, she really has no clue. At all. Here is a short list of things that she made me try on because "clothes looks different on the rack than they do on the body. Sofi. SOFI.  HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT? YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED IT ON! "    a shiny silver button-down dress shirt that made me look a bit like Ellen Degeneres, were she born on Mars   a black see-through top with a rubber band looking thing that pulled across my breasts. Very Electric Circus/45-year-old Francophone hooker   a horrific shirt with a freakishly huge and fluorescent pink Vampirella collar   this insane cowl neck thing with roses and birds and hell all over it   a black and red tank top with big-ass flowers all over it that I believe was made entirely of sequins   finally, a monstrous bustier of sorts made of thick black lace with sheer sleeves that might have been sexy for a month in 1983     Thankfully, my time spent in fitting room purgatory was rewarded with a lovely, classy, simple, feminine black top with a mandarin collar that I actually like. (And mom even paid for it).  In other news, Conan O'Brien has been taping Late Night here for the past few days. I didn't manage to get tickets, and am pretty bummed about that since I've been a fan for many years. So close, yet so far. Adding to my bummery was overhearing a conversation between these two little punks on the subway the other day. They were just heading home from the taping and were talking about how funny Triumph was, etc. I wanted to shout "I loved Conan before you were even zygotes!" but then I realized a) they were probably not zygotes, but eight or nine when I first became a fan of Conan's and b) they probably had guns stashed in their big black trenchcoats. So I said nothing. I sure did sulk, though! Boyyy did I sulk.  (Now playing: "Billy Billy", The Smugglers)

       Cold Brains   I'd like to think that I'm secretly a genius, but  urlLink these bloody internet IQ tests  always take me down a peg or two.  My score this time around was 127. In my defense, I kind of rushed through it and didn't read the questions all that thoroughly. But there you go. I can deal with being only-just-slightly-above-average. (Mind you, I hate hate HATE that my brother got 137. I always figured he was smarter than me, but not ten whole points smarter. Thankfully, I monopolized the cute genes.)  On an unrelated note, please pick up this month's issue of  urlLink Chart . I'm a real live contributor nowadays, and a few of my reviews are featured in the back pages. Also, my Chart writing ends up  urlLink here  for some reason. I don't get paid for anything for those, but still. Neat-o.  (Now playing: "Keep Close", South)

       And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out   The reason that my attempts at bloggery never ever catch is this: my life is boring when I have enough time to write, thus I have nothing worth writing about. When my life is interesting, there's never any time to do anything, let alone write. So there you go. That's today's excuse.

      I work at a busy in-call centre as a customer service representative for a large daily newspaper. I probably talk to close to one hundred people per shift. Relating funny work stories re: random ineptitards who call us and spout forehead-slapping stupidity would necessitate creating another blog entirely. So, instead of making fun of people who deserve it, I will now share with you a bit of cruel humour at the expense of generally nice people...with really awful names. I know that I - Sofi Papamarko - am not particularly one to talk. My name is arduous, contains many syllables and sounds a bit like popping corn when pronounced correctly, but at least my name is not...      Judy Belcher    Clarence Bytheway   Gloria L. Bejesus    Hugh Pugh   Golda Fischenbacher   and finally, my new favourite... Barbara Huha      Anyway, I think I should be commended on my graceful and respectful interaction with all of these people. I did not laugh at them at all while on the phone with them. Instead, I have chosen to deride them publicly, on my blog. Good.  I found another 99 cent bin wonder at my local sketchy drug mart. Twice Removed on cassette! Fun!  I'm going to a French academy to take a language proficiency test in a bit, in preparation for moving to Montreal. I haven't used French in ages. All I really know is "Je joue au hockey" (which is a vicious lie), "J'Adore Dior", "Poutine, s'il vous plait?" and "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?"  Speaking of coucher-ing, does anyone want to sleep with my friend  urlLink Jay ? I'd appreciate it. I think he probably would, too.

      After work today, the lovely  urlLink Miss Chelsea  kindly met up with me for  Mission: Sofi Makeover . I'd been trying to coerce her to help me out for a little while, because a) she is a freaking cosmetics  guru  and also b) I haven't seen her in something like 4 years - not since before she and Matej moved to Prague. It was fun and girly. I bought  urlLink this amazing lip/cheek stain  and  urlLink  Cargo lip gloss in Machu Picchu  . Spent far too much money, but I'll just have to live with myself. (I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.) Oh, and I got semi-lost coming home from the subway. I took the wrong bus for the first time ever and ended up in Nowheresville. Which was pretty scary, since my parents were in Collingwood today and I had no one to bail me out. I eventually found my way with the help of a kindly, attractive francophone TTC driver. Gold star for him.  I just watched the series finale of  Sex and the City , and I am not ashamed to admit that I bawled like a little girl. Honestly, best show  ever ! Anyone who is scoffing at my love for it has obviously never watched more than one episode.  Alison and I went to the Fox and the Mirkin Ball or something on Thursday night. It was a sad excuse for retro night, and we enjoyed watching the very obviously underaged jailbait parade about in their off-the-shoulder shirts and acid-washed jeans. Alison is super. I'm happy that we've stayed friends, and that we can talk about more than just highschool. By the end of the night, my cheeks literally hurt from laughing/smiling so much. Awww.  A conversation with Rob about men's ties prompted me to remember something. When my brother and I were like 10 and 11, we bought our dad a vinyl inflatable shark tie from the Zoo for his birthday or Father's Day. It was probably a pretty hideous tie, but we believed it to be the greatest thing ever. The cool thing is that dad wore it all the time. Every time we went out to dinner and sometimes he'd (pretend to?) wear it to work. I think that's a cool thing for dads to do. I hope I remember to wear any and all of the ugly, tacky shit that my kids make/buy for me.  (Now playing: "Let's Go", The Jessica Fletchers)

       I'm On Fire   Just two days after getting accepted to Concordia, the nice folks at The Toronto Star informed me that I am no longer a temp. They have decided to hire me as a permanent employee. Wowee zowee. A bit of a surprise, considering that they were feeling unsure about me less than three months ago...  Anyway, this means that I now have job security, health benefits (Work With Benefits = Friend With Benefits, but way way cooler), some say in what my schedule looks like, paid vacations, and I am no longer on contract. Which is great and everything, but I'm leaving the company/city in two months so I'll hardly be able to milk it for all its worth. They'll probably be willing to take me back after I graduate, though - it's good to have a safety net, even if I never have to use it.

       Whoop, there it is!    Concordia University Journalism Department March 16, 2004  Dear Sofi,  Congratulations! On behalf of the journalism admissions committee, I'm delighted to invite you into the Graduate Diploma Program for 2004-2005. You are part of a select group chosen from the largest applicant pool I've seen in my tenure as graduate program director, so pat yourself on the back...   Nee hawwww! I'm going to Montreal! This sweet victory is made even sweeter considering that they only accept 22 students a year for the post-grad journalism program. Word. I'm all elite and shit. Anyway, here's to a year of smoked meat, cafes, Leonard Cohen sightings, bilingualism, bagels and binge drinking! Many thanks to all for their kind words of encouragement and congratulatory emails/phone calls.  Aside from the acceptance (woo!), not a lot going on right now. I got a new pair of glasses today. They make me look like a grown-up/boffable librarian. Who falls down a whole lot. I'm still getting used to them, so my depth perception is a little...off.  For those of you who go/went to Queen's, I suggest you read this  urlLink post from Tavis' blog . It's pretty freaking hilarious if you know the girl in question.

       Moonage Daydream   It seems to me that everyone I know is just one great big giant ball of stress lately. What with work woes, law/med school, applications for yet more school, break-ups, weddings, apartment hunting, apartment subletting, exams, loneliness, deadlines, crazy family issues, etc., it's a freaking wonder that everyone is...well...so mentally/emotionally stable. Or at least they appear to be on the surface. Things could be worse for us, sure. But things could certainly be better.  I'm going to indulge myself for a moment and daydream away. Now. I would very much like it if the following were to happen in my life (chronologically), so that I may lead a blissfully tension-free existence:  1) Get accepted to Concordia AND Ryerson for their Journalism post-graduate programs. Win scholarships. Big ones.   2) Win the lottery. Five million or so will suffice.  3) Fall in love with the perfect man who will pledge his life and heart to me forevermore. He will enjoy hand-holding and give unbelievable head.  4) Raise 2-3 perfectly balanced, healthy, exceedingly bright and reasonably attractive children who will adore their parents and themselves unconditionally.  5) Write the Great Canadian Novel, touching the minds and souls of millions of readers worldwide. It will not be featured on Oprah's book club. Oprah will be long dead, her book club forgotten. I will proceed to give 100% of the profits to charity (seeing as how I'm already a millionairess and all).  6) Discover unequivocal evidence of the existence of heaven and learn that I am headed there, despite my strong atheistic tendencies and my refusal to go see "The Passion of the Christ". Die peacefully in my sleep at the age of 88 - NOT in a car accident or of a brain aneurysm while pinching out a particularly big one on the shitter.  Yes. Yes. That will do nicely.

       We Put the High in Highschool   I hereby pronounce  urlLink By Divine Right 's Jose Contreras to be the nicest, coolest boy  ever . I did an in-person interview/photoshoot with him today for  urlLink Chart 's "Stylin'" section, and he is warmer and fuzzier than the crazy toques and scarves he is so fond of sporting. He is also mellow although surprisingly quick-witted, keeping all of us in stitches with his zany antics and hokey Sears Catalogue poses. Also, he has a very endearing smile. The icing on the cake was getting a big patchouli-scented hug from him at the end of the shoot. Hmmm. Methinks I have another rockstar crush. Screw you, Pete Elkas! I am a fickle fickle girl and am jumping ship. Jose all the way? A-OK!  On the way home from the shoot, I was so brimmingly full of happy Jose vibes and goodwill towards men that I bought a homeless man some lunch from Tim Horton's. I've never done that before. He was very gracious and said, "You don't know how much I appreciate this." I don't know what I said to him. Probably something stupid. I should have asked him his name, but I didn't. Anyway, I'm not mentioning this to be self-righteous. I'm just letting you know that very few things in this world feel as good as making somebody's whole entire day, so I suggest that you go ahead and do that. You don't necessarily have to feed a homeless person. It can be something even simpler, like perhaps giving someone who really needs it a patchouli-scented hug.  Tonight, Alison and I saw a movie ( urlLink Spartan , which was alright. I find David Mamet's dialogue kind of clunky sometimes, and he's often clueless at developing realistic romantic subplots/relationships. Otherwise, it was gory and unsettling and vaguely intriguing and it made me hate America and their media spindoctoring and their filthy FILTHY lies), ate chicken wings at an empty Shoeless, and bitched about stuff (as we are wont to do). We also reminisced about highschool. It's astounding how little I remember about that time in my life since it wasn't all that long ago. Memory is strange. I hope I don't lose my university memories five years from now as they were quite a lot better.  Happy St. Patrick's Day! Give 'er to your liver.

       Painkillers for my Heart   I've had a rough past couple of days. I'd get into more detail than that, but it's too private a matter for a public medium. Those closest to me know what's going on, so I don't feel the need to elaborate. Nonetheless, for the sake of posterity, I have alluded to it cryptically and that's really all I feel the need to do. But enough about that.  I've got this entrance essay (Ryerson's Journalism postgrad) due next week and although I've known about it for weeks, I haven't even begun to write it. Or even think about it all that much. I have no idea how I made it through four years of massive essay writing when the thought of writing a piddly 300 word paper turns my stomach so. Maybe it's because there is so very much riding on it. Maybe it's because I have become really lazy this year. Maybe it's because the only writing that I've been doing lately is of the fun variety. Hey, does anyone feel like writing 250 - 350 words on how one specific piece of journalism inspired me to pursue the field? I'll bake you cookies! Chocolate ones, with nuts (or without nuts, if you are allergic)!  Speaking of nut allergies, did any other at-home-on-a-Friday-night-loser see the premiere of that new show "Wonderfalls"? It is like nothing I have ever seen before. It is fantastically funny and original and just so refreshingly bizarre that I wish I had written it. The premise is only half as kooky as the show itself: a depressed 24-year-old philosophy graduate named Jaye lives in a trailer and works in a gift shop at Niagara Falls. On the verge of a mental breakdown (or possibly not), toy animals at the gift shop talk to Jaye and instruct her to do certain things which eventually lead to a happy pay-off for others, ie. her lesbian sister finds love, the friendly UPS guy has an emergency pen shaft tracheotomy after accidentally eating peanuts but then the nurse of his dreams gives him a spongebath and they end up falling for each other, etc.  Also , all of this mad mad madness might have something to do with the superpowers of the Maid of the Mist fountain, but it also might not. Even if you don't think it sounds like your cup of tea, I urge you to watch it before it inevitably gets cancelled for being too good. If you don't laugh out loud uproariously at least three times, I'll eat my hat! Or one of those cookies I baked you earlier! Damnit, I'll eat  something !

       I See Fine (Young Men. Named Pete Elkas. On The Subway.)   After work, I got off the subway at Don Mills like I always do. As I walked up the stairs towards the buses, a young  man was descending to my left.  This was my thought process:  1) Holy shit, that guy is stunningly beautiful (this is holy shit-worthy only because Don Mills station is a haven for ugly).  and half a second later...  2) Holy shit, that guy is Pete Elkas!  Unwilling to let any opportunity to make an ass of myself in front of a hot musician pass me by, I turned around (for he was now behind me) and called,  "You're awesome, Pete!"   (I have absolutely no idea how loudly I shouted after him as I was wearing headphones at the time.)  Anyway, I am not at all embarrassed by my "shout out" since I was rewarded with a gorgeous billion watt smile, given freely by a benevolent green-eyed Greek God who walketh among us. (At Don Mills station, of all places.)  Oh Pete Elkas. Oh  my . You make me happy to possess a uterus.  (Now playing: "Still A Flame", Pete Elkas)

       Action Pact   In order to counteract the vaguely depressing post below, I will now list off some fun, happy things that are making me smile.    Buying a Morrissey cassette I have never ever seen before at my local drugstore for 99 cents. It was next to Linda Ronstadt's Greatest Hits.   There is a distinct possibility that I might be living with Valerie  and  Liz in Montreal next year!   I'm going to see pretty pretty Matt Barber play tomorrow night after having dinner with Hilary. I will likely present him with a gift of cinnamon hearts.   Having a fancy dinner with Lindsay, Katherine, Ben, Lee and Don on Friday night at a sooper secret location. Ben insists that the dress-code is "casual fabulous".    I have found a grown-up signature fragrance! It is called  urlLink Connexion  by Lancome (click the link at your own risk - yikes, I'm one of THEM now) and it is lovely. It's like the smell of my skin and some foreign flowers (Rob or really anyone: shiny nickel if you can pin that lyric). No more Calgon body sprays for me!   The snow is melting and it's still light out at 6:45PM.    I'm finally seeing The Salteens and Sekiden on Sunday afternoon, possibly with some excellent company.    So that's nice.

      Yesterday, I saw a cute little Buddhist monk (the Dalai Lama is currently visiting Toronto, so we've had a sudden influx of Buddhist monks recently) wandering in the Eaton's Centre. I found that really funny and incongruous. (He must have heard that Old Navy was having a sale on yellow and orange robes.)  Also,  urlLink this totally sucks . It means I'll have to find a new band to hire to play my future wedding.  (Now playing: "Everywhere With Helicopters", Guided By Voices)

      Aside from my vision and my poor wrists (diagnosis: tendonitis) going straight to hell, I'm worried that working in an office for a year has also caused a slightly larger problem in my overall well-being. I'm just not very  interesting  anymore! It's true. I can't hold up my end of a conversation. It's scary. The other day, I hung out with my friend Angela from Queen's. Ange is cool because she saved my life in 2nd year (literally as well as metaphorically) and she waters her plants with an I.V. drip. Anyway, so we were catching up over dinner. She had been doing most of the talking because her life is actually cool and exciting (she works in a hospital doing respitory stuff and she's getting married in September) but kept trying to get me to talk about my life:  Angela: So! Tell me! What's new? Sofi: Duhhhh....the finale of The Apprentice was pretty good.  Hopefully this is just a temporary thing and going back to school will kick-start my brain and social skills. These gimpy fingers of mine are certainly crossed.  Here is some free advice for all: do NOT participate in or even GO to a wedding one month after the end of a relationship of yours. There is nothing more depressing. Bill & Jenn's wedding was stunning and sophisticated and beautiful, but the gorgeous flowers and sumptuous seafood course and the My Big Fat Greek Wedding band and elegant organza dresses sort of faded into the background while Sofi's Self Pity took the mainstage and threw some bottles into the crowd. Late in the evening they played a lot of slow songs. I promptly went to the bar and shot some Bailey's. And then I got some wedding cake. And then I acquired more Bailey's and sat down at an empty table and ate the cake all alone and watched all the happy in-love couples dance to Unchained Melody or something equally corny and weddingish. Once tipsy, I got a bit upset and - taking my cake and Bailey's with me - marched right up to my mother (dancing cutely with my father) and loudly proclaimed, "Booze and cake are MY boyfriend!" She laughed a lot. I nodded solemnly, marched away, and finished eating my boyfriend.  This is about all the typing I can handle for now. I'm looking forward to buying some speech recognition software this weekend so I can update more frequently and start writing things (emails, articles, stories) again. That will be nice. I'm a little worried, though. I tend to think best through my fingers, not through my mouth.  (Now Playing: "Hindu Times", Oasis.

      I have apparently developed RSI (that's Repetitive Strain Injury, genius) in both wrists - seven months of near-daily data entry (not to mention MSNing, emailing, writing, blogging, cooking, waving at people, brushing my hair, brushing my teeth, reading, exercising, putting in my contact lenses, taking notes, flipping channels, playing cards...etc.) have finally taken their toll. My wrists are very achey and tired and my left hand feels numb sometimes. And both of my hands are very very cold all of the time (moreso than usual) which may or may not be related to the pain in the wrists. At work, we filled out a form to send off to the Worker's Safety Insurance Board or something like that just in case "you eventually lose the use of your hands." Um... yikes ?? I am reminded of that fairytale "The Girl With No Hands" that I studied in beautiful wonderful Dr. Tim Conley's short story class. I don't recall an especially happy ending.  Anyway, I'm hazardously typing this post just so people don't start leaving smarmy "update your blog!" comments. I won't be updating my blog for a little while. I need to rest these puppies. Dig? Groovy.  Easter was this past weekend. My entire extended family (upwards of 35 people) descended on our household and it was joyful chaos, as usual. Too much food, as usual. I demolished half of the blueberry cheesecake, as usual. Blaurgh!  Bill & Jenn's wedding is this Saturday, which blows my mind. It's always seemed so far in the future, and now it's here! Pretty exciting stuff. I am seriously considering fake 'n' baking because my arms are just so pasty and I want to look hot in the gorgeous bridesmaid dress. Morals + intense fear of skin cancer vs. desire for golden glowing summery beauty for one single day. We shall see.  My wrists doth protest too much. Over and out.

      I've been trying very hard not to turn this blog into a soapbox for me to bitch and complain about work, but the following conversation I had with a customer this morning pretty much blew me away. It encapsulates every stupid stupid  stupid  (one stupid is not nearly strong enough) person who I have ever had to deal with while at my current place of employ.   I have one really big pet peeve; I absolutely cannot stand talking to a customer about their account while they shout across a room/kitchen/massive fjord/abyss on speaker fucking phone while they water their plants/pets/children. I think it's only fair that they give me 100% of their attention. After all, I am giving them 100% of mine (usually). So I no longer condone the use of speaker phone. I won't help them unless they pick up the damned receiver and speak to me like a human being. Every time I hear the faraway voice and telltale eerie echo of a speakerphone, I tell them to pick up. I don't think that's particularly unreasonable, do you?  Ahem. Lights, camera...   Me:  Toronto Star, blah blah blah, Sofi speaking..   Him:  ( speakerphoney ) Hello, I'd like to...   Me:  Sorry, sir. I can't hear you. Are you on a speakerphone?   Him:  Yes.   Me:  Would you pick the phone up please, sir?   Him:  Okay.     40 seconds silence while I wait.     Him:  Hello?   Me:  Hello.   Him:  I'd like to...   Me:  Sir, I still can't hear you. Could you pick up the phone, please?   Him:  Oh, yes. Okay.     20 seconds silence.      Me:  Sir?   Him:  Yes, hello.   Me:  Sir, have you picked up the phone yet?   Him:  Yes.   Me:  Sir, you're still echoing. Would you pick up the phone?   Him:  I did.   Me:  No sir. No you didn't. I can tell you're still on a speakerphone.   Him:  No.   Me:  YES SIR, you ARE. Please pick it up or this conversation cannot continue.   Him:  Okay.    10 seconds silence.      Me:  Sir?   Him:  Fine   You can't make this kind of shit up, folks!  Anyway, it wouldn't have been nearly so irritating had the sir in question been a) old b) infirm c) old and infirm or d) in the possession of less-than-stellar English comprehension. But he was middle-aged and normal-sounding and only had the faintest of accents, so he understood the meaning of pick. up. your. phone. sir. just fine.  Am I being overly grumpy? If I am, I am sorry. I had one of those I'm-so-tired-I-can't-sleep nights (oh, lookie that! I worked in a Nirvana reference on a particularly good day to do so) and my brother was up all night with the sick while my parents clucked and cooed over him, so I probably fell asleep around 4:45-ish. And had to get up for work just over an hour later. So I am more than a little out of it. Loopy, even. Valerie recently used that word to describe what happens to her after listening to too much Velvet Underground, and I've decided that it's a pretty boss adjective.  On a slightly higher note, this weekend I went to the One of a Kind Show with my good highschool friend Ameet who I haven't seen in a very long time. We visited Erin, saw her beautiful sculptures and had an all-around good time. Also, I bought these freaking adorable  urlLink Batgirl undies  . Everyone should own Batgirl undies.

      I'm a French-speaking genius. I had my first class at the Academie Francaise the other day and everything I learned in Extended French in junior highschool and h.s. came flooding right back to me right then and there. I know a lot more than I thought I did. So I'm happily feeling 100% more confident about covering francophone press conferences and I still have eleven classes to go. Maybe I'll even download a little Mitsou and expand my vocabulary exponentially. (Cowboy =  mon  cowboy. Noted!)  Yesterday, I had ginger chicken at Ginger with Lindsay Lynch. She is lovely and always fun and has the inside scoop on the Canadian music industry. It's pretty impressive how much she knows. Oh, and her eye make-up was really pretty (hi Lindsay!). She and I are at very similar stages in our lives (the "new start, clean slate, finding myself" stage), so it was very comforting talking to her. Later on, Katherine and I went to see  urlLink Lederhosen Lucil , who krautrawks mein hosen. If you have never experienced her live, I suggest you do so because there are very few things more entertaining in life. (I've often described her as a novelty act gone horribly, horribly right.) Anyway, her theme for the night was gardening - in tribute to springtime, which has yet to arrive - so there were plastic flowers littered all over her Yamaha, and Krista/Lucil wore red-and-white checkered lederhosen and gardening gloves. The highlight of the night was when she brought up her back-up band...two studly rockstar-looking guys dressed as garden gnomes. Vests, beards, gigantic hats. The works. It was pretty priceless. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy her set 100% because she didn't go on until 12:20AM and I was already sleep-deprived. Also, we had to tolerate two really awful openers - this girl Jenny from the Barmitzvah Brothers (who I hear are pretty good as a whole) and Parka 3 who pushed the "We're good because we're so painfully bad!" irony thing a little too far. Shaggy hair, nasal & insanely off-key singing and a kooky smattering of xylophones do not a cool indie band make. They should have just stayed in their basement.  I bought my first bustier today. It kicks a whole lot of ass.  Also ass-kicky: in the latest issue of Chart, my name preceeds Patrick Pentland's on the Contributing Writers list on the masthead. Our names look really good standing next to each other. I'll have to point that out to him someday.  I'm going to go to bed now. Seriously. Daylight Savings Time means I will  be waking up at 4:30AM RealTime for work tomorrow. Pray for me.  Oh, and also pray for my dear  urlLink Ben's  eternal soul. He went to Brazil and I doubt he'll ever be coming back...  (Now playing: "Ooo...OMG", Lederhosen Lucil)

      This week has been a mad frenzy of laundry, packing and socializing. I used to think I didn't own very many clothes. I now realize that I was wrong wrong wrong. How did I manage to acquire this much shit over the course of a mere 23 years? I don't understand it. Attempting to be very Philip Glass about packing and am only taking that which is absolutely necessary, which is pretty hard. My CD shelf and hundreds of CDs are staying in Scarborough. I am only taking 35 essentials.(Narrowing it down was a  brutal  task.) My stereo stays here, as my computer plays CDs. All of my sweaters stay here. Every book but one (Miss Wyoming, Douglas Coupland) stays here. Even my DESK will stay here; it's too big for the van and my room. I'll have to find one at a Value Village over there. In conclusion, I have altogether too much crap and packing is stressful.  This past week, I rammed in a lot of goodbyes. Dinner with Ben on Tuesday. Bata Shoe Museum and the AGO with Lindsay on Wednesday, followed by dinner with Lindsay, Liz, Carolyn and Lee (and an Avril Lavigne sighting). Thursday was shopping with Dhimo and Alison, followed by dinner at Jack Astor's, which provided a pretty funny sight gag (I ordered the World's Smallest Chocolate Mousse for dessert and Alison ordered the Colossal Sundae. My mousse came in a shotglass and her sundae was roughly the size of a basketball. I ended up splitting it with her, of course). Today will be Family Funday, consisting of visiting extended family and bonding with the immediates. Then, tomorrow morning at 6AM (!) my parents and I will leave for Montreal. Forgive me if I don't update/email you for a while. I'll be spending the weekend with the folks, and after that there is no guarantee that I will have internet access right away.  I've been waiting for this for so long. I can't believe it's finally come.  (Now playing: "Almost", Sarah Harmer)

      Today was my last day of work and (coincidentally?) I have a brand new stapler.  This morning's irate callers were surprisingly devoid of bitchiness and/or ass stupidity, so I couldn't really tell any of them off. Kind of a letdown. But since it's a civic holiday, I got paid  triple  time! That worked out to roughly $1/minute, so I made three dollars while peeing. Not bad. I should parlay that into a career, somehow.  Tonight, when the neighbours are setting off their traditional fireworks, I will pretend that they are for me. Screw you, Queen Victoria. Happy no more working, Sofi!

      Yesterday I spent 3.5 hours in the Royal Ontario Museum by myself. Since I'm moving so soon, I'm trying to sop up all of the Toronto I can handle. I haven't been to the ROM in years, but I still remembered where everything was. (Although I don't remember the Bat Cave being that scary  ever .) The highlight (and the real reason I went) was the Eternal Egypt exhibit which I've been wanting to see since February. It was all very neat and impressive, but this one tiny 3000-year-old drawing of a lion and some birds on papyrus kind of freaked me out. It looked like it could have been a cel from The Lion King or something. The drawing style was almost...Disney-esque? It's weird how a scribe thousands of years ago drew a lion the same way that an animator today draws a lion. I suppose people are people, and people breathe and walk and eat and fuck and draw cute cartoon lions in essentially the same way, thousands of years apart. (I can't think of a better way to explain the weirdness than that.)   Another freaky thing: in the art deco section of the ROM, they had this section devoted to the most popular material of the 20th century - plastic. They had stuff like dishes and furniture and knick-knicks all made out of different variations of plastic, and one of the knick-knacks was a Flintstones popsicle mould in its original packaging. You know, those plastic containers with Fred or Betty or Wilma or Bam-Bam on them that you would fill with orange juice and stick in your freezer so you could have home-made popsicles when you were a kid? Yeah, those were there.  Something that I have USED is in a MUSEUM . That's weird and scary and wrong.  Later on, I met up with Liz, Carolyn and Juliet for dinner at a cute little restaurant on Harbord. We sat on the outdoor patio and had cheap (but delicious) white wine and talked until it got dark. It officially felt like summer.  Four more days of work. Nine more days of Toronto. Despite the fact that my possessions now belong in museums, I'm still young enough to have fresh starts. That's comforting.  (Now Playing: "Goddess on a Highway", Mercury Rev)

      If I were magically granted 3 wishes, I would distribute them as follows:  1) Peace on earth (as usual) 2) Riches beyond my wildest expectations (also as usual) and 3) A record deal for  urlLink The Salingers    Seriously. Those Salingers boys are ridiculously talented. Some of the best songwriting I have  ever  heard and some solid musicianship to boot. Not too shabby for a few guys from Queen's University. Eat your fucking hearts out,  urlLink Bedouin Soundclash  ! You too,  urlLink Matt Barber!   You won't be pretty forever, Matt Barber! That's right.  Were I an A&R type (and alas, I am not. But I'm working on it), I would have signed them last night at the B-Side. Were their performance a complex mathematical equation, it would go like this:  The Salingers = The Beatles + The Strokes + The Who + Franz Ferdinand x 4 + complete and total hotness + they give good hugs + severe make-out-ability - fuck, they have hot girlfriends + I don't care, check out Chris Hickey's killer dimples + awww, are their moms/dads sitting over there? + they covered Hendrix without sounding like a lame highschool cover band + what was that song? Did they write it? Holy shit, it was awesome! +  dude .  Anyway, I wish them all the luck in the world and I sincerely hope that they "make it" so I can tell everyone that I lusted after them way back when.  I slept a grand total of two hours last night, due to the jungle-like heat and humidity of my bedroom. I threw my window open to get some air circulation, but loud chirping woke me up at around 5. The early bird can absolutely go to hell. I'm pretty sure my apartment in Montreal is A/C-free. However will I cope?  I went to the Clothing Show today (after waiting in line for nearly half an hour). It was kind of underwhelming and struck me as being rummage sale-esque. Mainly old crap that I would get rid of were it in my closet. Granted, there was some cool stuff like  urlLink  this hot number   but it was few and far between amidst the costume jewelry and ugly old lady scarves.  Sometimes I wish I were a fashionista, but it looks like so much work.  (Now playing: "You're Giving Up", The Salingers)

      Blogger has kindly given HTML idiots (such as myself) a little more selection when it comes to blog templates. I thought this one was real purty. I like the star. It's orange. I'm going to stick with it for a while.  The downside is that I lost all of my links and lovely previous comments in the move. I'll fiddle around and make things right in terms of links, but leaving comments is  your  responsibility. Do it up.  I got a new computer! I got a new computer! Happy birthday to me!  Last night was my final French class. It wasn't so much a "class" as it was "go to the Keg and drink and eat and speak in an abortion of the language that can only be described as Frenglish". I think the waitress thought we were crazy. But that's okay, because she was also crazy. (I've literally never seen anyone so happy. She acted like serving us was the highlight of her life. I bet she's the one on staff that all the other staff call Annoying Girl behind her back.) Saying goodbye to everyone in my class was sad, because they were all genuinely nice.   I must now scoot off to have lunch with Jose Contreras (business, not pleasure. But everything with that guy is a pleasure). That will put me in a decidedly good mood. I may also see Robin for a short period of time today. He will be wearing a suit. I will be laughing and pointing.  (Now Playing: "Soft Machine", By Divine Right)

      Liz came to visit for a few days because she had a job interview in Toronto on Friday (pssst...she got the job on the spot as she is a veritable superstar). Her interview was in the morning and very close to the Ontario Science Centre, so we spent a blissful few hours exploring an indoor rainforest, riding a virtual bobsled and watching cool coral reefs die (but don't worry - the man in the movie will fix our ecosystem by planting a lot of mangrove trees) in an IMAX film that almost made me throw up. After I worked in the afternoon, we ordered pizza and watched The Muppet Show and played boardgames (Life and Trivial Pursuit). I got my ass kicked in the game of Life. At one point I was $307 000 in debt and wound up gambling my car, husband and only son on the number 6. I did not spin a 6.  It's really fun to act like you're eight for an entire day. I highly recommend it.  Lindsay (fresh from Belize) also came to visit for three hours on Saturday and we had a nice extended lunch at Marche along with Liz's McGill friend, Tony. The company was lovely, but I couldn't shake the thought that it would have been an unpleasant afternoon indeed had I not been so observant during the creation of my lunch.  Marche guy: What do you want in your stirfry? Me: Vegetables, udon noodles and teriyaki sauce. Also, I'm kind of allergic to peanuts, so would you ensure that you not use peanut oil and please fry my food in a clean pan? Marche guy: Okay.   Ten minutes later...   Marche guy: ( dumping a strange, chunky sauce all over my almost-done and delicious-looking stirfry ). Me: Uh...was that ginger and garlic that you just put on my stirfry? Marche guy: What? Me: What did you just pour on my stirfry? Marche guy: Spicy Thai peanut sauce. Me: Uhhhhhhhhh....but I told you I was  allergic  to peanuts. Marche guy: You didn't ask for peanut sauce? Me: No. I am fairly sure I did not. Marche guy: Oh ( starts up another stirfry for me ).  Anyway, I can't entirely blame him; that place is noisy and busy and (as Rob would put it) he has low job satisfaction and probably doesn't care very deeply about what sauce I want with my noodles. Next time I will just wear a t-shirt that says, "If you feed me peanuts I will get hives and my lips will swell up and I will wheeze and with my last breath I will totally lose my shit and kick your ass."  Ryerson accepted me to their journalism program. Not to sound cocky or anything, but I had few doubts that they would. Their journalism post-grad program is three times the size of Concordia's and I also had a bit of an in who was willing to help me out if I needed it. Anyway, Ryerson's lame, impersonal and poorly-worded acceptance letter(in comparison to Concordia's nicely-worded, sunshiney one) made me realize that I probably made the right decision. Good for me.  All right, at the risk of making this the longest blog entry of all time, I really have to share a somewhat unpleasant anecdote about my day:  On the ride to the subway, a rather large woman got onto the bus. Probably about 400 pounds (although that really is a ballpark estimate), mainly concentrated around the stomach region. It was so large it was sagging down to almost her knees. Anyway, she stood in front of me, despite the fact that there was a seat next to me. I figured out that she was standing because she wouldn't be able to fit into the one seat, so I decided (after some internal debate - would this be a nice gesture or would she be offended by it?) to offer up my seat to her. She said she was fine, thank you. And continued standing directly in front of me. She smelled like sweat and vegetable soup and the bus was getting hotter. Not so good.  As the bus continued, it got more and more packed, so she was sort of forced really close to me. Her stomach ended up practically resting in my lap. Needless to say, it was a really, REALLY uncomfortable and socially/physically awkward 30 minutes.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not judging this lady. I'm not Kate Moss myself and although I do not consider myself to be an extreme in any way, I could easily stand to lose some weight. So I understand what she must be going through in her day-to-day life and I sympathize completely. The situation was really really weird, though. I mean, where do I LOOK? Does she REALIZE how uncomfortable I must be? Is she not backing down/away because she was offended that I offered my seat and this was a sort of revenge? Does she have no concept of the unspoken "personal space bubble"? It got me to thinking about that contentious really-obese-people-should-buy-two-plane-tickets-instead-of-one-if-they-don't-fit-in-the-seat issue. That made me really angry. I mean, people who are 300+ pounds already have so much to deal with, why punish them for something that they haven't yet been able to control? Now, after having had some complete stranger's belly in my lap for half an hour, I am not so sure if my kneejerk reaction to the issue was completely thought out. The obvious answer to this problem: business class, economy class, big fat ass class!  (Classy.)  (Now playing: "Little Pink Stars", Radish)

      My wrists are feeling a lot better (praise be to my physiotherapist!) so I hope to update my blog a little more frequently from now on.  I've had an action-pact few days. Nick and Wendy's wedding was on Saturday (wedding 2 of 4 in '04) and although it was kind of surreal (Nick was in my grade all through highschool and looks exactly the same as he did back then, so it was like witnessing the marriage of a couple of teenagers) it was shockingly fun. My mom, dad, brother and I had all had a few drinks and were consequently feeling relaxed and silly. My brother continuously proclaimed his awesomeness, my dad took some amount of pleasure in playing an abortion of a basketball game with balled-up rose petals and a vase full of water and my mom said the word "vagina" in public without shame. It ruled. I think my immediate family is a lot more alike (personality-wise) than any of us would ever care to admit. Too bad being sober and busy and stressed-out and  crazy  all the time ruins our potential constant fun.  Yesterday I had dinner with my favourite Toronto triumvirate - Katherine and Ben (+ me = triumvirate). Katherine is going back to Winnipeg today, so it was our Last Supper. Those two have made my year bearable, and I will miss our girltalk over delicious and often extravagant dinners. Ben's "friend" Jean dropped by for a while, and he was pretty great. Very genuine and smart and extremely cute. After he left, I made a surprising semi-drunken admission (to Katherine and Ben, but also to myself) that I don't think I could ever marry anyone without a chin dimple. It's true! I think I can count the number of chin-dimple-free men who I have been physically attracted to on one hand. Chin dimples are just. so. hot. (I blame this strange fetish of mine on Kirk Douglas ca.  Spartacus .)  Rob (chin dimple) arrived  nearing the end of our dinner, and he and I eventually made our way to the Horseshoe to meet up with Lisa,  urlLink Mr. Andrew Cowan  (no chin dimple) and Joan. Sadly, Joan wasn't feeling well enough to stick around for the Apples in Stereo concert, but it worked out in the end - Lisa's friend Ryan McClare (no chin dimple) decided to come so he took her ticket and bought me a beer. He and I also bonded over music, eye Weekly and Wavelength. Ryan was cool. It gave me hope that I still have the skillz to make new friends, something that has very much been on my mind since I'm moving to a new city in less than a month.  The Apples in Stereo show itself was amazing. They're probably in my Top 5 favourite bands, and I had never before seen them live, so I was really looking forward to it. I was not disappointed. They played a good mix of old and new. They also ran the gamut from their poppiest pop ( Rainbow, Seems So, Please, Ruby ) to more psychedelic fare ( Love You Alice/D, Strawberryfire ). During  Love You Alice/D , Rob leaned over to me and said something along the lines of, "I can't believe I never realized this song was about LSD before." My jaw  dropped , because that had never occurred to me and probably never would have had he not pointed it out.  Love You Alice/D. Love you LSD . Jesumaria! I'm a naif, fo' real!  (Now Playing: Nothing at all. But I'm singing "Love You Alice/D" substituting the Alice/D with Sofi/P.)

      Tonight, my summer roommate Alex and I bonded over asian cuisine, broken hearts and a buried friend. I always knew we had potential.  We have an assignment in Computer-Assisted Reporting class where we have to interview a classmate via email, and they interview us right back. I just replied to Gaelle's 10 questions, and it was so stream-of-consciousness and uncensored that I feel compelled to copy and paste it here. (Warning: it's long.)  > 1. What are the differences between the place you were born and the > city you live in now?  Scarborough is your typical suburban hell, with cookie-cutter bungalows, strip malls, power fields, donut shops and countless violent crimes and teen pregnancies because there's nothing else for the youth to do. Montreal, on the other hand, is this beautiful, diverse, bohemian utopia. Montrealers strike me as being very passionate people. Not to get all new-agey on you, but this city exudes a very strong energy, and I feel like I could feed on it for the rest of my life. Maybe I'm still in a honeymoon period, butI like it here. Very much.  > 2. What are all the reasons that you choose to live in Montreal, > whether they are for Montreal or against elsewhere?  I knew that I wanted to study journalism in a major urban centre, but I wanted to steer clear of Toronto for two reasons:  a) My parents live there (Scarborough is technically part of the Greater Toronto Area) and although we usually get along fine, they drive me a bit crazy after a while. Rent in T dot is so high that it would make no sense at all for me to move out on my own and b) My four years spent in Kingston doing my undergrad were the four best years of my life. I fell in love with that city, and I wanted to opportunity to start fresh and fall in love with another one.  Having visited Montreal a few times, I knew it was a place that I would enjoy living. Plus, I have a couple of good friends from my undergrad who now attend McGill, so I knew that I would have a smooth transition because they'd be around come September. I love the thought of a fresh start, but going to a strange city full of strangers would be scary. It's nice to have that social safety buffer.  > 3. What do you spend most of your time doing?  I spent most of my time sleeping. That is followed closely by reading, writing and daydreaming.  > 4. How does it relate to your sense of belonging on this big, crowded > planet?  How does question 3 relate, you mean? Okay. Well, most people need sleep. And reading is the best method for humans to communicate ideas with other humans - fuck the internet. And I garner a bit of a sense of self-worth whenever I write something. At the risk of sounding pompous, I feel like I'm giving something back to the world. Just a little piece of myself. It's validating. Once something is in the public domain, you never know how many people will come into contact with it. I mean, it never ceases to amaze me that.....okay, I'm going off on a bit of a tangent here, but this morning I was singing this Aimee Mann song to myself. "You Could Make a Killing" or something like that. It's really beautiful. It was vaguely popular two or three years ago. (I think it appeared on the soundtrack to that movie "Magnolia".) Now mostly forgotten by the masses. But it just suddenly APPEARED in my head, and I wonder if Ms. Mann or really any musician or artist or writer or poet realizes that their stuff is OUT there, that people are still being affected/moved by it years and years later. Even after they think it's been forgotten by everyone but themselves. I find that really incredible. I hope I write something worthy of being remembered by someone, somewhere, sometime in the future. Not necessarily 500 years from now. I know nothing I write will resonate like that. But...maybe some boy in the year 2023 will find some poem or short story or article I wrote in a book or somewhere on the internet and maybe he will think,  urlLink  "Neat."    > 5. What are the elements of your life that make you feel most free?  Writing is the most freeing thing I can imagine. I also like playing on swings.  > 6. What are the elements of your life that make you feel most comitted?  I'm not sure I understand this question, but I'll try. I feel very committed to myself. Let me explain. My grandparents, all four of them, had pretty shitty lives. They lived through poverty and World War II and subsequent civil war and worked really hard and managed to come to Canada to make a life for themselves and for their children. And, subsequently, for their children's children. Being me. They suffered so much, just so I could have things handed to me on a platter. I have literally been denied nothing. I've realized that living the best life I can live, and making the most of the opportunities I have is the best way to repay my grandparents for the enormous sacrifices they made for us. So I'm committed to making a good, meaningful life for myself and being proud of the decisions I make.   > 7. Tell me the childhood anecdote you least like being the subject of, > whether it's your mum, or a friend who likes telling it.  Oh man. Gaelle, you absolute bitch! Okay. Fine. My mom is very fond of telling this embarrassing anecdote of me as a kid. We were having dinner one night, and were eating chicken drumsticks or something. And I asked my parents, "How do they grow the bones inside of chicken?" I had no idea I was eating an animal. So they explained to me what we were eating. And then I said my somewhat-famous line, "You mean THIS chicken...is THAT chicken??" and I pointed to our budgie. My parents find this traumatizing event in my life really really funny. I didn't eat chicken for years afterwards. Which is funny, because chicken is really the only meat I eat now.  > 8. Why do you choose to inhabit your home (whether it's a messy little > appartment just for you or a spic and span mansion with a hundred > roommates) the way that you do?  I find comfort in messes. I also like my living space to reflect my personality. I'm currently subletting a room from my friend, so it's all her stuff and all of her artwork, so I'm feeling vaguely transient. I can't wait for September so I can put up band posters and postcards of trashy pulp novel covers and say "This is MY space."  > 9. What is the nightmare that pisses you off most?  When I was a kid - like maybe 5 or 6 - I had this recurring nightmare where I'm sitting on my mom's shoulders. And we're running through the playground of my elementary school and we're both laughing and laughing. And suddenly she hands me off to this witch (literally, a witch. Green face, pointy hat, the works.) and I'm suddenly riding on HER shoulders, and the witch is cackling. And my mom is still laughing, and running in the opposite direction. And I start to cry and jump off the witch and run towards my mom. I finally catch her, but the second I get back on my mom's shoulders, she turns into the witch and I can see my mom running away again. I would always wake up crying. It pissed me off because I couldn't believe my mom would do that to me. Even though it wasn't real, I remember being mad at her in real life. I can't remember ever telling her about the nightmare, though. Holy childhood abandonment issues, Batman!  > 10. What in the world makes you feel most tired, other than a lack of > sleep?  Making new friends. It's exhausting.  Okay, I'm not going to read this over because I'm pretty sure I'll censor myself or get really embarrassed and re-write it. And...SEND!

      Thanks to Daphna for visiting this past weekend. (I promise I'll be more fun next time.)  Last night I went to the Green Room (yes, there's one in Montreal too) to see the band of a guy in our journalism class. Whoever booked the bands must not have heard them play before, as The Abjects were preceeded by a particularly unfortunate girl trio and a Christian folk duo. Not so seamless.  The reason I am mentioning this night is because there were these DJs there who were all shaggy-haired and dandy (in a Gaven Dianda-esque endearing way) who played the  best  music. Some highlights that I can remember:  The First of the Gang to Die - Morrissey Substitute - The Who Making Time - Creation You've Really Got Me - The Kinks I'm Cheating on You - Franz Ferdinand Come Up and See Me (Make Me Smile) - Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel (which has been in my head for  MONTHS , but I never knew who sang it. It's a great drinking song. Please download it immediately.)  Does this playlist sound familiar to anyone who was a regular at the Toucan on Friday nights last year? Right. These shaggy-haired dandies were essentially my male DJ equivalents. It made me very very happy. I ran up to them like three times to declare how much I loved whichever song they were playing at the time, and did little grateful bows to them every now and again. I was even thinking of proposing marriage.  (My, how the turntables have turned.)  I think  urlLink  my dear Matt's   theory on DJs getting lust and panties hurled at them is entirely correct. His thinking is that the DJ is the physical embodiment of some drunk chick/dude's favourite song. And the listener wants to be a part of that somehow. Consequently, they attempt to lay the blessed DJ.   In conclusion, DJing was the best job ever.  And speaking of coming up and seeing me, I have decided to make a conscious effort to be more like  urlLink Mae West   in every way. I'll let you know how that goes.

      First twinges of homesickness struck a few days ago. Not homesickness like "Man oh man, do I ever miss Scarborough and never having fun!" Just this sense of displacement and palpable loneliness. I'm feeling better now that I've been in the company of familiar people, but it was a brutal feeling for a while there. I'm realizing that I am not one of those people who are perfectly content to live alone. (I'm talking to myself a  LOT , and it's scaring me.)  I spent Thursday night with  urlLink  Sherwin . I don't know Sherwin very well, but he is well on his way to becoming one of my favourite people here. He's like this...whirlwind.  And  he likes Belle & Sebastian. We ate dinner at Parfum D'Asie and proceeded to Cabaret to get uncomfortably warm and take in  urlLink  Feist .  Friday was our first broadcasting class, and I'm less scared of it than I thought I would be. I dislike the idea of being on camera  ever , but radio will be fun and learning about digital editing and such will be super keen. A whole bunch of us went to St. Sulpice afterwards, which is this pub with an absolutely massive back terrace. We drank pitchers and ate poutine and chatted for hours. Our little class is gelling nicely, and for that I am glad. Eventually, I went to see the always-lovely  urlLink  Hayden   (featuring Cuff the Duke in a walk-on role) and Great Lake Swimmers with Joslyn, Katie, Jose and Paul from journalism. Jenny and her friend Liz W. arrived later on, and I spent the majority of the weekend with them.   My Liz was also here this weekend, and a bunch of us had delicious fancy salads and beer at the Shed Cafe all afternoon. All in all, a lot of love was felt and I am looking forward to my summer roommate's arrival on Wednesday. Rah! Rah! Sis boom bah! (I now understand why lonely old women adopt like a billion cats.)

      Further observations on Montreal:      It smells good here. Like, all the time. It was almost 30 degrees out today, and yet it smelled really lovely. It smelled like flowers and sunshine - even downtown! I'm not used to that. Summer should smell like gasoline and garbage and sewage. (Also, it's not difficult to breathe in deeply on hot days, like it is in Toronto.)      As Ben # 2 pointed out, gaydar is practically null and void in Montreal. Some guy with a really great haircut and a pink shirt with a butterfly collar and tight white pants walking down the street in Toronto? Gay, sans doute. Some guy with a really great haircut and a pink shirt with a butterfly collar and tight white pants walking down the street in Montreal? Straight and fashionable.       As my mother so aptly observed, "People in Montreal drive worse than people in downtown Calcutta!" In the span of 2 hours, I saw two different cyclists almost get hit by big giant trucks. I've never felt so nervous crossing at green lights before, yet native Montrealers jaywalk across main streets without fear.       People here have really great shoes.      Journalism orientation started on Monday. I had first-day-of-school jitters, but all is turning out well. There are 20 of us in the program, and I genuinely like each and every single one of them. They're all just so interesting/sweet/funny/smart/friendly. A group of us are going to see Hayden and Cuff the Duke on Friday. And I didn't even have to twist any arms! People actually WANTED to go! Yeah, I think it's going to be a good year.  Big giant gold stars to Alison and  urlLink  Gaven   for being the first to send me fun mail at my new address. Few things in life are funner than fun mail.  (Now playing: "Un Poison Violent, C'est Ca L'Amour", Serge Gainsbourg)

      Forgive the large gap betweens bloggings. I've been busy settling in to my new digs, as well as playing hostess to Daphna's good friend Ben # 2 (not to be confused with  urlLink  Ben # 1  ). We've spent the vast majority of our time wandering around town, playing Scrabble, buying delicious bagels from Mile End (Montreal's equivalent neighbourhood to Bathurst & Lawrence - Hasids everywhere!) and watching Sex and the City DVDs. Oh, and eating. A lot. What's better than that? Nothing.  A couple of nights ago, Ben and Tony and I went to the village (it's funny how my fruit fly-ish tendencies follow me from city to city) to sing a little karaoke at Club Date. Tony and I brought the house down with our version of "Summer Nights" (I know, I know). Ben did "Mac the Knife", Tony did "New York, New York" and while singing Blondie's "The Tide is High", I was very much hit on by a middle-aged lesbian. It was kind of funny - she hopped up on stage and started singing along with me and I thought, "She must be really drunk and like this song a whole lot." Two minutes later - when I felt her nipples in my back - I remembered that I was in a gay bar. And oh  good , she just groped my ass! (Ben later told me that he noticed I had no idea what was going on and wanted to say something. It was funnier discovering it on my own, anyway). Aside from that uncomfortable sidebar, that was probably one of the funnest nights I've had out in a really long time. Karaoke is the greatest.  My French is improving. I'm learning new words every day. Unfortunately, no matter how much vocabulary I pick up, I am starting to realize that I will never be able to communicate effectively with native Montrealers. They speak far too quickly for my liking, and often drop the middle syllables of words entirely. When I was getting my hair cut the other day (I now like it, but immediately afterwards I had this incongruous asian schoolgirl haircut happening. It was scary and too cool for me. Especially since I'm neither asian nor a schoolgirl.), my hairdresser and another were chatting back and forth, and it might as well have been in Arabic. Je n'ai compris pas un mot. Fuck.  I'm looking forward to the start of classes, but I'm also not looking forward to it. It all depends on my mood. I've always been one of those people who loves school and whose internal clock starts in September and ends in June, and I'm really excited to meet some new people. Yet at the same time, it's been really nice to just bum around, tan, explore, shop, do nothing. This has been my summer vacation. It all ends tomorrow.

      Holy shit, I haven't posted in forever! I'm turning into  urlLink  Seth   over here!  My excuses include, but are not limited to: massive amounts of work,  urlLink  Cameron   is visiting for a few days, and it's just so bloody nice out.  Today is Liz's birthday! Happy birthday, Liz!  We are celebrating by going to Santropol for lunch, followed by another afternoon at the Tams (AKA Tam Tams AKA Tam Tam Jams), which is this cool hippie-throwback drumming circle/dance party/picnic/love-in that happens in Mont-Royal park every Sunday afternoon. Yet another neat Montreal thing that would never fly in Toronto.  We had a party in honour of today's birthday girl in our apartment Friday night, which was pretty great. I feel that I am an excellent matchmaker. I pat myself on the back.  I'm throwing a birthday party in honour of myself this coming Saturday, and am a little anxious about it, since our downstairs neighbours are already pissed at me for Friday  (among other things). I will bake them some chocolate chip cookies pre-emptively in the hopes that they don't call the cops. Anyway, it should be cool. I intend on getting completely smashed - something I haven't done in what feels like a very long time. My initial plan was to drink an entire 2-4 by myself - in celebration of every year spent on this planet - but then I realized that that is a really fucking stupid idea. Especially since I'm a 3-beer-drunk.  Last night, Cam and I went to see By Divine Right (with opener Jessie Stein, who is precious, and Sire) and it was such a party. I wasn't drinking at all but I danced the night away. Usually I'm the stoic who jams my hands in my pockets and shakes my head at the crazy dancing girls. Last night, I was one of the crazies. It was very very very very very very fun. I need to let go and totally lose my shit more often, I think. Also, Darcy Rego was Dylan Hudecki's replacement for the show (on account of Dylan getting married), so we chatted for a bit. Darcy remembered me from GW-Palooza and was exceedingly nice. He has lots more hair now.  After the show, we went to Reservoir and met up with Aaron Klopp and Mel, who I haven't seen in close to three years. It was a nice little  urlLink  Golden Words   reunion. Seeing people who I haven't seen in a long time makes me happy. Especially if they are essentially the same people that they were Before. It's kind of comforting.  (Now Playing: "Bijoux", Manitoba)

       The following post includes 97% Canadian content:   I celebrated Canada Day by eating birthday cake with Ben, Andrew and Alex. Unfortunately, that was the extent of my partying-down-ness. I've been so bogged down with schoolwork, it's ridiculous. I don't understand why the program is so intensive during the SUMMER when it's nice out.   I severely want a watch tan. It hasn't happened yet.  I should perhaps mention that I had a very interesting election night. Our print prof had us cover it live, and file the piece for the following morning. It was a late, crazy night. I hung out in the Liberal campaign office in my riding and drank their beer (Labatt Blue? Wouldn't Rickard's Red have been more appropriate?) and followed that up by attending the Bloc Quebecois victory party with Paul. Definitely something to behold. Bloc supporters are a fascinating, insane breed. The noise and energy was akin to a sporting event, and their blind fervor for Gilles Duceppe was akin to devotion to a cult leader. The creepiest thing about it was how easily I could have been swept up in the excitement. "Vive le Quebec Libre!" I wanted to shout. Lots of real media-types were covering Duceppe's speech. Some of them looked younger than me, which was a bit depressing.  You should pick up the July/August issue of  urlLink Chart , with the Beastie Boys on the cover. My very first full-page feature is inside. I'm proudest of the  "Sweet on You" sidebar. It reminds me of the stuff that I used to write for  urlLink  Golden Words . I honestly can't believe I can get away with that kind of shit in a  real  magazine.  I don't want to do anymore schoolwork. I don't want to do anymore schoolwork.  I don't want to do anymore schoolwork. I don't want to do anymore schoolwork. I don't want to do anymore schoolwork. I don't want to do anymore schoolwork.

      Yesterday, I attended my first-ever Pride parade. I'd always wanted to go to the one in Toronto, but I would either a) be working b) be sick or c) feel sort of lame because I didn't want to be the tagalong straight girl.  I got over c) and embraced my inner dyke. She's easily coaxed out. Especially when I wear my Lara Croft-esque green tank top, my watch with the thick leather strap, zero make-up (not even mascara!) , earth mother-y sandals, and a kickass rainbow wallet chain, courtesy of Montreal Benjamin. Whenever I caught glimpses of myself in storefront windows, I had to do a bit of a double-take. Visually, I make a very convincing homo.  The parade, although 1.5 hours late, was quite the spectacle. Lots of beautiful people. Lots of not-so-beautiful-people. Lots of drag queens. Lots of balloons. Lots of Britney (but no Madonna or Cher, as Benjamin pointed out. Blaspheme)!  I found parts of the parade incredibly moving. Especially the lesbian mothers with their babies, and the really impassioned gay youth groups who were very Hooray For Everything in attitude, but far from cookie-cutter in appearance. Their energy and optimism was inspiring. I was proud by proxy.  Later that night, we went to La Salla Rosa for Meow Mix, which was this lesbian cabaret and burlesque show. It was less sexy than cheeky and absolutely hilarious. I kind of want a pair of sparkly red pasties. (Just for my own personal use, of course.)  On the way home, Liz and I talked about how many interesting people we've met since living in Montreal. (We met a lovely male-to-female tranny named Jessa, which got us on this topic). At Queen's, everyone was pretty Children of the Corn. We could think of very few exceptions.   Liz: "Are you white, straight and upper-middle class? Come to Queen's!"  I knew ONE gay person at Queen's, and I have already made five gay friends here. That's pretty neat, I think. Montreal seems to have a really supportive queer community. You're probably 100% less likely to get a pounding from a loutish jock here than in Kingston.   (Now playing: "God Makes No Mistakes", Loretta Lynn)
