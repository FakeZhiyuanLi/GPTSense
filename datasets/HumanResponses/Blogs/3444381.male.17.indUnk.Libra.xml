      Chem exam is done.  My feelings:  ehh, it's over.  Did well enough I suppose.  And so begins the summer of isolation and depression....

      Dinner with the AP class...  I hate those people.  I can't explain it.  They're all liars. Maybe its the constant sexual references.  It's funny the first few times..but Christ.  It could the fact that they're alcoholics.  They certainly are upstanding members of the Honors Society..that's for damn sure.  Maybe I'm just being judgemental....Maybe I just don't like them.   But I couldn't be happier that I won't be seeing them for a long while.  Or anyone for that matter..

      Yearbooks bother me.  I don't want to write in some random asshole's yearbook about how much fun this year was and how much I'm going to miss them.  I don't like to lie.  I look at it in one of theses ways: 1.  I don't like you. 2.  You ignored me all year. 3.  I ignored you all year. 4.  It's just way too easy to piss you people off.   If I don't like you, I'm not going to sign your goddamn yearbook.  I'm not going to humor people anymore.  I'm taking a stance right now.  Against what? you ask...  Well...I'm not exactly sure.  But I'm sick of the high school mentality.  And if you happen to be one of the few people I like..don't take it personally.  I'm just an equal-opportunity asshole.

        Hells yeah.  I'm in a rather good mood.  The SAT's were insanely easy.  Everything seemed so far below me.  The worst thing were those goddamn chairs.  I swear those things were intended for elementary schoolers.  My back is killing me.  But, anyway...I'm thinking at least a 1300.  Yeah.  No sweat.  I am indeed...still cool.   Sort of..   no?   Yeah..you're right.  Off to slit my wrists.

      I don't know of anyone who really needs to know any of this any way..but since&nbsp;I have been gone a while..I'll take a bit of time and recap.  1.&nbsp; Long Island is a strange place.&nbsp; I can't really quite put my finger on it..but I always feel a bit unnerved there.&nbsp; I like parts of it a lot.&nbsp; But there's also a number of things I hate about it...It's a changing place.&nbsp; Traffic is always a mess..things are very overpriced..many of the people are assholes...the remaining green spaces are being developed.&nbsp; I just wish they'd stop..now..but it will be inevitably ruined..like so much else...  2.&nbsp; On a school related note, I got a four on the AP exam.&nbsp; This is good.&nbsp; Alas, I did&nbsp;soundly mediocre on the SAT's.&nbsp; This is not good.&nbsp; Enough about academic academics.  3.&nbsp; The Chautauqua County Fair!&nbsp; Yeeeeeeehaaaaawwwww!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Disgusting.&nbsp; Absolutely disgusting.&nbsp; Except the tent with the two guys from Ecuador.&nbsp; They were good guys.

      You know..in the realm that is Vince, there are not many days that contain anything worthwhile.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Well..today is slightly different.  Slightly.  I got up at nine, and proceeded to run three miles.  It was hot..I was hurting..but I did indeed finish.  A small victory.  I had a relaxing morning..and then I finally got out and practiced my driving.  Wasn't quite as bad as I thought I would be for such a long layoff.  Went to the college, and practice the parallel parking.  First one was kind of shitty..but I nailed the second one.  Three turns of the wheel bitch....  We then proceeded up to Blasedell and got ourselves some pizza.  I came back home..and ate.  Chatted with a few people who I happen to enjoy spending time with.  Reloaded some things onto the computer and relaxed for the rest of the day.  I suppose many people wouldn't find anything about this day all that relevant, or special..and neither do I.  It was just...nice..relaxing...  Kind of what summer should be about...  For me anyway...

      I remember all the nights I stayed up with him, sitting next to my dad, with his voice drifting through our back room. Calling all nine innings as if it was his first...  A win brought Murph back with the happy recap..but a loss wasn't quite as bad, as long as you had Murph. My dad was brought up with the Murph, Kiner, and Nelson..the original three. My dad always brought his little radio to the games..and put one of the plugs in his ears..and we listened to the Murph..and watched him..and more than once..we greeted him outside of Shea.  I remember when I was very young..and we saw the Murph entering one of the gates at Shea. I approached him, and he kneeled down..and said "Hello there Sweetie"..and gave me his autograph. It was by far..one of the most intense experiences I've ever had...I didn't realize it at the time..but it was.  We saw him outside of Shea last year..and things had changed. His gait was slow..his spirits a bit lower. But it was still Murph. Just another 80-year old going to work during an absolutely dreadful Mets season. NY Mets radio simply isn't the same without Murph. After he retired, things just weren't the same. It's not to say there won't be another great Mets Broadcaster...but no one will ever replace Bob Murphy.  I don't mean to sound so melancholy and mournful..as if I'd lost a father or close relative, but over the years..I've kind of formed a bond with him..as have many other fans. Its something that those who never felt it, will never really understand.  Here's to you Murph. I'll miss those "word pictures" of yours..and the warm, dark, nights that accompanied them.
