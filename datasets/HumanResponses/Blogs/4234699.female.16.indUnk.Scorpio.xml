           Superstition of the Day:  Seeing an ambulance is very unlucky unless you pinch your nose or hold your breath until you see a black or brown dog.  Hey all.  I went to see  The Village  with Jami and her dad.  I love her dad, he is so funny.  My dad grew up with him, so I get to hear all kinds of stories.  For example, they drank creek water that would have killed them if it had not been early spring.  The movie was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. I had no desire to see it, but there was nothing else, and I ended up liking it.  Very strange ending and very strange looking "things," but it was good.  We then ate at Pizza Hut because my mom didn't make the meatloaf she said she was going to make.  After the movie and eats, we got together with Emily and Nathan, a.k.a. Goose.  We drove around and ended up at the Gallipolis Park.  We saw this couple walking on the dock towards us, and they came off as rude to the group. Not me exactly, but the guy was making fun of something Jami said about the ducks. So we walked to Foodland and bought some bread to feed to the ducks.  When we came back, they were still out there.  So we noisily fed the ducks while Jami half-threatened to make fun of them.  It was funny. Then we went to Wal*Mart - woo. Emily and Jami talked with a bad English accent because the girl from that couple was English or something.  We got back, and I had to get my brother's car because he's taking mine to get brakes put on tomorrow.  They think I have band tomorrow morning and can't take it. Weeeell...I don't have it until 3, so I lied so I could sleep in. Ha, sorry family.   "All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces, bright and early for the daily races."

           Did you know that most toilets flush in E flat?  I got to sleep in a little more than usual today since it's Saturday.  I went to Huntington for some school clothes shopping.  My mom just had to go to Home Depot first.  She's crazy for those home projects.  So we went to JCPenny's and got everything there.  I got 5 pairs of pants, 4 being jeans.  They had a deal to get one pair of Arizona's and get the second pair for a dollar.  Yea, it was great.  Then I got some more shirts in other stores and an awesome microbead pillow.  I love these things.  It was a long day of shopping.  I don't particularly enjoy long hours of shopping, but I got tons of stuff.  When I got home and started slipping tags, I found some of those Inktags on some pants and a shirt.  Stupid JCPenny's didn't cut them loose.  And we weren't about to try it ourselves. Too risky...  Jami called me, and we talked about our day of school clothes shopping.  She told me that there was a Nick and Jessica look-alike contest in Charleston.  I thought that was funny.  She's coming here sometime soon so we can talk about how there's nothing to do.  She's down the street at Austi's right now, so I'll be seeing her soon.  One last thing: I'm getting new brakes on my car Monday!  They're in bad condition right now.  Very jerky.  So I'm excited to get new ones.

              Band was tiring today.  I was sleepy and playing and marching a while doesn't exactly get rid of the fatigue.  We have this thing where you can play a certain song from memory, and we get to leave early.  I did it today and had the chance to leave a full 7 minutes early, sweetness.  Only I decided to stick around and talk to people I normally don't talk to...I don't know why. Let's talk about stupid drivers.  It's true when someone tells you, "You just don't know how many morons have their license until you get your own."  I consider myself a good driver; I haven't hit anyone, and I've only missed one stopsign, and it was on a backroad when noone was on it. Anyway, I always get stuck behind the slow ones or the ones who can't decide if they're turning or not.  Oh, and the I'm-not-going-to-turn-my-blinker-on idiots are pretty common around here as well.  I didn't encounter anyone too bad today, but I can feel something coming up next week (especially once school starts, uhg). Well wait, there was one thing today.  I was behind a truck in Jami's neighborhood.  I was coming up on her street, and I wasn't sure if the truck was turning or not.  He stopped, started turning, and then stopped again after he made his turn.  THEN, he starts going backwards, causing me to throw my car in reverse and step on the gas kind of quickly.  He then decided to keep going straight rather than turn onto Jami's street. Idiot.  School starts Thursday, noooooooo!  I hate school, and I know I'm going to hate my schedule this year.  Hard classes all the time and not knowing who will be in there with me.  And once school starts, so will the hype about football.  Everyone thinks the football team is cool or whatever, but they win about 2 games a year, if that.  Then, the cheerleaders prance around in their outfits distracting the crowd.  The band is the only group that can actually do something and do it right, but we don't get recognized.  If we do, people stick their big noses in the air and say things like, "The band sucks, they're dumb," while their precious football team is losing 7-39.  Speaking of school, Suzanne's sister left for college today, and I bet Suzanne is crying her eyes out.  She keeps saying how she's going to miss her sister, but she'll only be an hour away!  She can come back on the weekends and possibly weeknights as well. Plus, there are phones around here; we're not technologically challenged.  And if it turns out that way, there are always letters.

           Band was okay today.  The only bad thing was it got hot and humid after being kind of nice this week.  Oh yea, and noone likes to look at the drum major, gr.   After band, I went to my grandma's, aw.  I had lunch and just visited for a few hours.  Then Jami picked me up, and we went to Arby's.  We talked about how much band sucks and how someone's quitting and another one won't be at any competitions in September.  I swear, people are so stupid.  They can't just stick with one thing.  Jami took me back to my grandma's so I could get my car.  I walked in, and Andy's "party" was starting...kind of.  One person was there.  They were playing Halo and made me play, but 3 more people came, so I took my chance and ran.  I don't mind Halo, but I have better things to do.  About today's title: it's a song by Aimee Mann.  Jami and I were discussing it, and she told me the story behind the name.  It means the high on Sunday is 51, as in the weather.  See, I always thought she was talking about a highway, but the weather thing is better. So thanks, Jami, for being on those Aimee forums!   "So here I'm sitting in my car at the same old stoplight. I keep waiting for a change, but I don't know what. So red turns into green turning into yellow, but I'm just frozen here on the same old spot. And all I have to do is just press the pedal, but I'm not."  I'm Not by Aimee Mann      Aahh, such a good song

           I hate opening each blog with something about band, but that's all I have to talk about in the middle of the day. Practice sucked as usualy. Yea, we got things done, but it's always annoying. We have to repeat drills, and my section can't march at all.  I went to Pizza Hut with Jami and Goose last night.  It was veeerry interesting.  Goose was on something, but I'm not sure what.  I've never seen him that crazily hyper.  I did get to see his kitten - so tiny. I also got to listen to Jami and her dad play guitar.  John is so funny, haha.  I love your dad, Jami.   Andy's having a "send-off" (army) party with his friends tomorrow.  He's having 6 or 7 guys over to play Halo and eat.  Then, everyone else leaves for college the next day while he finds something to do for the next 3 weeks. He plans on building another computer once he gets the chance, whenever he gets stationed somewhere.   "I find, sometimes it's easy to be myself.  Sometimes, I find it's better to be somebody else."

           Band again today, woo. It turned out to be better than yesterday. Before it started, I asked Jami why she wasn't there yesterday. She said she was at King's Island with her Youth Group because she worships Jesus. Then, she continues with, "Yea, and you don't; you're going to Hell." Jami, it may have been for laughs, at least I hope so, but I don't appreciate being accused of not worshiping Jesus. I was almost embarrassed, as well (kind of weird to say). Don't take it the wrong way Jami, I'm not mad. I just don't wish to be hinted of being the Anti-Christ. I can't help that my family won't go to church. I guess I could find my own way, but still.  Anyway, great news! My brother, Andy, won a computer contest for building his own computer. I can't remember the site, but some guy was hosting a contest for the most unusual, original computer. Andy's been building a computer, from scratch, out of an old snare drum. He cleaned it, painted some of it, and bought new parts for the computer. He made it for one of his friends, and a brother to me, Joel. He was away for the summer marching for the Bluecoats Drum & Bugle Corp. For the contest, there were about 5 entries or so with 3 judges. The judges decided unanimously Muffin Man, Andy, be the winner. So yay Andy.  Suzanne's sister wants me to go to some Mary Kay party tomorrow. Ha, I don't think so. First of all, I don't wear enough make-up to need to test all the crap. Secondly, my mom sells Beauticontrol, so if anything, I'd go with that - it's free ;).

           Alright, well. We had band practice today after being off for a week. Only a third of the people showed up, and we had no drum major. We had to do it over and over...  I do want to know why certain people weren't there. Jami, where were you, hmmmm? Were you puking or spending time with Holt?  If you were smart, you'd be sleeping. That's what I would have done.  It was way too cold in my house this morning, and I was tired.  So I watched  Shattered Glass  last night. Jami lent it to me a long time ago, and I finally watched it. For those who have not seen it, it's the true story about Stephen Glass, a writer for The New Republic. He lies about a lot of his sources and details in order to get ahead in the business. I'm amazed that his articles were even published, since they have to check and recheck all the time, but they were nonetheless.  It's a good movie.  The only other thing I've done today is listen to Suzanne try to call Josh.  That was half-way entertaining for about a minute.  She kept putting it off like a chicken, sigh, *shakes head.

          I realized something about my first blog.  At the end, I'm not saying I'm obsessed or addicted to anything.  I said that to back up how Aimee's songs feed your emotions because their emotional.  Anyway, on to the blogging...  My friend, Brooke, got home from the beach yesterday.  She was forced to leave because of the hurricane.  So, I talked to her today, and we got to clear up anything that has happened in the past month and a half.  She was at Penn State for a math class all July, and then she went to the beach for the first two weeks of August.  She's glad to be back.  Jami, don't worry about the sick thing.  As long as you get better, and I don't have to find cool stuff to do by myself.  Heaven forbid I have to find new cool music ;).  I want to go ahead and say this: I don't mind hearing or reading about you and Holt.  Not to sound "mushy," but you deserve something to make you happy.  And to you Holt, keep her happy; you seem okay to me.  Well, nothing has happened today that's terribly exciting.  My grandparents came in for a visit.  I don't see them a lot.  Other than that, no, nothing.  I guess Brooke might come down so we can catch up some more (if she doesn't go four-wheel riding with Dustin, which sounded funny at first).   Jaymy - thanks for loving me with Holt and Val...*cries hysterically and says, "I love you, too!"  Speaking of goodbyes, I like french toast.   Au revoir until tomorrow!

          A friend of mine, Jami, showed me her blog, and it got me wanting to start my own.  So, here it is.  Jami is actually sick right now.  We were supposed to go do something tonight, but she's a little busy puking...sorry Jami.  Get better soon.  We still might go somewhere; it depends on her well-being.  There's a reason to starting this blog today.  I went to the fair yesterday - I hate the fair.  The only reason I went is Corey, a guy I know, said I should go to the fair while he's there.  I went and talked to him a little.  We were walking around with two other people, Suzanne and Josh (like half the people who read this will know the names I put in here), and I tried striking up conversations, but Corey didn't talk much.  Then he just walks off.  After that, I got in the weirdest mood mixed with frustration and confusion.  I think a little bit of offense slipped in there as well.  To end it, he went on vacation today, so I can't try to clear up anything.  My unusual mood extends beyond the fair; although, that's enough explanation for many.  When I got home, my mother decided to "tell me a thing or two" about me not answering my cell phone.  First of all, it was put in Suzanne's Jeep with her purse, and we had forgotten it was in there until it was too late.  Secondly, I wouldn't have heard it anyway with all the paging and stage crap going on.  Lastly, I tried calling home AND her cell phone before parting with my cell, and noone answered.  When I said that, she claimed that wasn't her fault.  Sorry, but I think it is her fault when she doesn't answer her phone (or call back - she said she was outside when I called.  It couldn't have taken an hour to talk to a neighbor.)  So I went to bed with this unusual mood.  I was sleepy, yet couldn't sleep.  Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Corey's face (which boiled my mood more, not anger mind you) or just thought about the whole stupid night and how it just didn't go my way at all.  To help me get through it, I put on some Aimee Mann.  Her songs are so mellow and soothing, they could cure any mood.  If not, they'll feed your mood because her songs are depressing or about addiction or obsession.  Either way, I win.  Sorry to seem like Complainer of the Year, but I had a mission for my first blog: vent.  I used to be bad at that, but now I can do it with ease (and this blog makes it even easier).  I think this is enough for Number 1.   "You paint a lovely picture, but reality intrudes with a message for you." - Real Bad News by Aimee Mann
