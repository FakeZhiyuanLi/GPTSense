       God damnit, I'm bored. Grace and Lauren went to New Jersey with Maura, Collin is in Houstan for the weekend and Patrick went to like some Marathon thing....... BLEHHHHHHHHHH       I'm just soo incredibly bored that it isn't funny. SOMEONE IS USUALLY ON THAT I CAN TALK TO! **seizures** mehhhhhhhh      I have to go shopping tomorrow with my mumsy for school crap. I need shoes, a different skirt and then regular clothes. x_x      So anyho, yesterday was fun. Gracie Patrick and I talked on the phone. Then Gracie like fell asleep, (she says she was listening, just not saying anything) so then Patrick and I talked for like 2 and 1/2 hours or so. It was quite fun actually. We never really talked until The fieldtrip to Boston in June. He never liked me because I was 'like Gary from Pokemon and he was Ash' I was just better than him. I liked better anime, knew more html and did better graphics. **boogies**       Thats all for now...      I'm slowly going insane. I've been listening to Slave 4 U by Britney Spears for the past 7 hours... Someone shoot me.

       o.O WAHOO. Today was fun. Grace woke me up at 11:14 to ask me if I was going down to see them. I figured I wasn't so I said no and went back to bed xD I got online an hour later and Patrick IMs me asking if I'm going down. I said probably not, but then I decided to call my mom and actually ASK if I could. Turns out she said yes and she got out of work, drove home, picked up me, drove back xD I got to Graces and then as soon as I saw her I was like, dude, we gotta go meet Collin at 7 11. Lauren hadn't told grace this plan I guess because she started spazzing o.o; Right as we were getting to 7 11 we saw Collin at his Gramma's house. We talked for a smidge and soon found out that he couldn't go. POOIE. We called Patrick and he told us he'd call us back. We then called Lauren and found out that she couldn't come either. Yippeee.. Grace and I walked downtown to chefs table, didn't see anything, walked down to brooks, walked to firehouse deli then back to chefs table as they ran out of bagels at FHD. I got CREAM OF CHICKEN OROZO SOUP! YAY! It wasn't as good as usual though. It was all watery and junk ;_; Then Patrick called and told us he was at 7 11. He came to Chefs table and then went to Mikes to get pizza... Bleh, this is weird how I tell stories xD Anyhoo, we walked to the park and crap and told Patrick that if he climbed the tree, I'd hug him xD So he did and then we made him jump down.. He was afraid to so he didn't xD hen we went to a different tree and made him climb up and jump down. He did eventually but it was soo wimpy that I decided to show off xD I climbed up the tree *in a skirt mind you* and then jumped down. I scraped my knee though being the klutz that I am. Then we went on the swings and crap o.O Ha. It was fun. Then I got a blister, it wasn't fun. Grace gave me a bandaid, but it fell off in the park somewhere xDDD We walked to 7 11 again so Patrick could get something to drink. I was going to buy candy but the cashier guy wasn't there and I didn't feel like waiting. We walked (I limped) back to the park. Patrick offered to carry me as I wouldn't shut up xD I told him no, not in public xD When we got to the park again we made him climb the trees and jumped down. Then we hugged him for a reward xD That kid is obsessed with hugs. Then we tried to talk Grace into having Patrick carry her. She would so I was like, fine, carry me then. He tried, and failed. I FEEL SO FAT xD It was funny though as he tried it the princess carrying way. OHH YEAH. WE WENT TO THE SECRET SPOT TOO! xD Lmao. Theres a couch down there.  Errrrrrr.. THE END!

        Meh... Boredness.. I'm /supposed/ to be cleaning.. uhmmm, yeah right. It sucked. I was SUPPOSED to go to Grace's house and hang out with her, Collin, and Patrick today.  But noo.. my mom said I had to go to Beth's house and help with the twins. Did I go? Nope. What a waste of a day :K  On the other hand, I have pretty much memorized 'Want' by Disturbed. A poor consalation prize for staying home all day if you ask me, but it will have to do.

       Meh... Another late night phone call. It lasted until 3:30 aM...      I was talking to Grace for 2 hours then Erika kept comming and going on and off then Patrick called around 12... Around 12:30 I asked him a favor.. To call Jim xD He talked to jim like 4 times and jim was and ass and never called Grace's number so we ended up calling him every 5 minutes or so xD We finally got ahold of him and we talked alot ._. Meh.. Patrick and him have too much in common.. I think he felt awkward too, but whatever ;) Patrick hung up around 3 because he was 'tired' Grace was hardly awake so Jim and I just talked for a bit. Wahoo xD Then Grace had a network failure and jim was disconencted... Then grace and I just hung up out of borednes.. I was really hyper. Seriously.. I was like bouncing around and stuff... Patrick thinks he sounds like a stoner

       I went to bed around 3 last night. My god we have some fucking funny phone calls. I realized that if I moan, Patrick will hurt himself, so of course, I moaned away and listened to him in pain. FWAHAHAHAHA...       Anyhoo, if I wanna go to Grace's house tomorrow I have to:   1. Make my Bed   2. Grab all my St.Joes school uniforms, put em in a bag, and hang the bag up in my closet.   3. Vaccuum up my room (so that means I must clean the room too)      **spazz** TOO MUCH SHIT TO DOOOOOOO      Ohh yeah, James goes to Arizona today to live with his dad for a month today. No AIMing for him. HAHA, he does have his cell though. Yup. ;D
