      Woke up this morning with a bad headache. I think I may be dehydrated, but it doesn't make any sense. I have been drinking lots of water. And, considering the fact I have not been doing any sport....I would have thought my intake should be exceeding my water loss.   I was the first one up this morning. So, I went down stairs and fed the cats and cleaned out their litter. I really hate doing that. When we had Kenzo it was so much easier. He just came and went whenever he felt the urge. So, we never needed a litter tray. But, ever since he was knocked down and killed out on the road, my control-freak wife will not let the Paris & Hugo out of the house. What makes matters even worse is she is always screaming at them for doing this or that. You know normal cat things. Like jumping on the furniture...Or, chasing each other around. To tell you the truth. I love pets, but life would be more calm and cleaner without them.  Oh yeah, how could I forget. Before the bitch could even say goodmorning she started complaining that I put the trash out this morning. How fucked is that? She said she was going to change the cats' litter, and that she was going to use the trash bag. I just don't understand why someone would make such a big deal over nothing. I just wish she would chill out for once.

      Well I'd only give the new Harry Potter film a 6 out of 10. I think the second was the best so far. I couldn't believe it when I looked over at my wife about half way through the fim....She had fallen a sleep. She says she is not feeling well. But, I think it is the stress. Its also wearing me out.   Normally, I am very active and sporty. Cycling about 12 hours per week give or take an hour or two. But, this week I have not been on the bike once. I need to start riding agian tomorrow.  Tired now. Just pulled out the futon matress onto the second bedroom floor.I have been sleeping in here for about two months now. With the occassional swap for the bed when my neck has been killing me.....I miss my real bed.

      Its saturaday afternoon, and i have been bored, and tired all day long. i did manage to get the groccery shopping done this morning. But, since then I would say the I have been completely amotivational. I don't even have the energy to be stumbern with my wife.  We are going to go out in a few minutes to see the new Harry Potter film. Going to the cinema and out to eat are about the only two things left that we seem able to do with each other without a fighting. We use to do so much together. For Christ's sake we use to even ride a tandem bike all over the place. But, now we don't even have conversations. That is unless you count her hen pecking. It drives me nuts. I just wish she would stop being a bitch. This shit has been going on for about three months now. And, I can't take anymore of this crap.

      Welcome to KenzosGambit’s Blogspot,  Just in case you are wonder what about the meaning and inspiration behind the name of KenzosGambit – Let me start with a little background information. In a nut shell, about three years ago, I decided to combine the two words, Kenzo + Gambit, in order to create a suitable screen name for a chess playing account that would articulate my interest in chess, my profession, and that would also pay tribute to my dead Burmese cat, Kenzo. Symbolizing the adventurous and luxurious lifestyle of my cat, as well as reflecting my former professional title of Perfumer, the name Kenzo was inspired by the Japanese fashion designer and his exotic oriental perfumes. Whilst, gambit was a reference to an opening move in the game of chess in which a player sacrifices a pawn or other minor piece in order to gain a strategic advantage.   Well since the creation of the KenzosGambit screen name about three years ago, I have played around nine hundred games of chess at www.pogo.com, and have experienced many ups and downs in my professional and personal life. Unfortuanetly, there have been more downs than ups. And, at the moment things are really shit. I no longer have a career, my marriage sucks and I really don't have much of a support network to help me through this rough patch. Oh well, I guess that's life, and I'll have to deal with it.   To tell you the truth.....I am not sure what I really expect to accomplish with this Blogspot. But, maybe in a strange way by writing this blog I'll be able to make some sense of what's going on and what I should do to get out of this mess.   I'll leave it at that for now. So, before I go....I’ll just finish with two more trivial facts concerning the meanings of Kenzo + Gambit: (1) if look up Kenzo in the Microsoft Word dictionary, the definition for a Kentucky rifle is suggested. Which is a muzzle-loading rifle developed in the 18th century and widely used on the American frontier. And, an alternative to the chess definition of Gambit is a remark to open a conversation.  Until next time….Take care!!!
