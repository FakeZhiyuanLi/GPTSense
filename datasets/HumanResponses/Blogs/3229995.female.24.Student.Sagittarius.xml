       Two of film history's greatest actors Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro can be seen in this subtle drama about falling in love with someone outside wedlock      This is far from a great movie, but to totally discard it is also wrong. What I liked about this movie is that it really tries to look into the actual conflict a person excperience when he or she finds themselves in love with someone else than their husband or wife.  The acting is what makes this movie good, Meryl Streep is sublime as Molly Gilmore and Robert DeNiro does very well in one of his few straight forward romantic lead. The sreenplay is somewhat underwritten, but the actors really sparkle without much more help than their talents.

        Norwegian superstar Sissel's first true attempt to break into the international charts is a smooth and relaxing encounter.       It all seemed to   work out for Sissel in the mid-90s with her excelent performance with Placido Domingo on the Norwegian Olympic song 'Fire in Your Heart', the Europeen number one hit 'Prince Igor' and singing the soundtrack for 'Titanic', but then the songbird went silent. She had been a superstar in Scandinavia since her debut in 1986 with 'Sissel' and her huge hit 'Love' ('Kjaerlighet'). She is to date the most successful artist to ever come from Norway and no artist has sold more records in Norway than her.   'All Good Things'   is a streamlined pop album with no big highs or lows. What the album can show for is Sissel's trademark; her remarkable soprano voice. Forget Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Barbara Streisand and other great vocalists, Sissel has one of the most superiour voices in the world, she sings like an angel.

       Portishead lead Beth Gibbons joined forces with Rustin Man and released the best album of 2002.       This sober, jazz inspired album is excellent for those cold long winter nights with a glass of red vine and good company. Beth Gibbons’ inhabits an amazing and powerful voice that often is not taken advantage of on Portishead’s releases. There is nothing wrong with her song writing abilities either and this is truly one of those albums that one should have in one’s record collection.

       Often overlooked, but really a good comedy. Hawn and long time partner Kurt Russel at their best. Not fresh, nor innovative, but a classical comedy plot and Hawn as dizzy as ever.      This screwball comedy casts real-life couple Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn in a film that finds the latter returning to her roots in a role reminiscent of Private Benjamin (1980). This is Goldie Hawn's film, she sparkles in one scene after another and hence showing why she is amongst the most successful comedians in Hollywood history.  A straightforward comedy, with no original twists and turns, but good wholesome American comedy.

       ABBA, maybe the greatest pop act in history, released their last album, ‘The Visitors’, in 1981 and ended 10 years of glory two years later, when they went separate ways.        ABBA had  an incredible run of chart topping hits throughout the latter part of the 70s and in 1980 they released their greatest album ever,the sublime 'Super Trouper&', by many considered the last well-made ABBA album. ABBA was showing new depths on this album, showing them selves capable of making more than catchy pop/disco tunes.    This trend  was taken further on 'The Visitors' and only &#8216;One of Us&#8217;, ABBA&#8217;s last single to enter the UK Top 10, is in the fashion of "classic" ABBA. The rest of the album has dark, melancholic undertones and dealing with obscure topics not associated with ABBA. Maybe the most underrated song on the album is the exquisite 'When all is Said and Done' released after the only major hit on the album 'One of Us', 'When all is Said and Done' is a ballad about an ended relationship, but dealing with the break-up in a more mature and reasonable way compared to the 1981 smash hit 'The Winner Takes it All'.     Other great  tracks on this album is the title track &#8216;The Visitors&#8217; dealing with espionage in the U.S.S.R., &#8216;Soldiers&#8217;  is a song about war and the strange, but catching &#8216;Two for the Price of One&#8217; which is about dating. &#8216;Head over Heels&#8217; was supposed to be a song in the fashion of &#8216;Waterloo&#8217; (their breakthrough single back in 1974), but the cool overall style of the song made it a very melancholic song and totally missed the target. But in retrospect this song has strong qualities    that has been overlooked and deserve a second chance.     Isolation and regret  is two of the major themes on this album, an album that also gives us an idea of what ABBA could have been if they continued recording throughout the 80s. &#8216;The Visitors&#8217; is one of the most underrated albums of its time and shows that ABBA always gave their best when    it came to quality of their songs.    urlLink The Official ABBA Site

       Renowned actress-turned-director Liv Ullmann helms this bleak, nuanced film about marriage and betrayal penned by legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman.      When watching Lena Endre in ‘Faithless’ one cannot stop and wonder how Björk won the Golden Palm for best acting at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000, because Endre is an acting tour-de-force. Liv Ullmann, herself one of the best actresses ever seen on the silver screen, has always been an actors director and this is evident in ‘Faithless’.  Who is in the wrong or right when a marriage is turning sour? Who is the victim in a divorce? These are the key points Ullmann highlights in her masterpiece penned by long time friend and former lover Ingmar Bergman.

       Kylie proved herself as more than a singer of bubblegum pop with her excellent performance in “Confide in Me” (1994) and her divine duo with Nick Cave in 1996 with “Where the Wilde Roses Grow”. By 1997 she was ready to take the step out of commercial pop and venture into new territories of music.        “Impossible Princess”  was to become quite an impossible release for the pop princess and its release would almost go un-noticed in most countries. The recordings was a hard trial for Kylie who was left with almost all the control of the albums development because of her deConstruction A&R collaborator Pete Hadfield’s ill health. This also meant that she was writing more than she had ever done before and this is the album where she comes out as more than just a singer, but also as a songwriter.    Kylie poured all  her emotions into this album; she gave it all she had, she also showed a far darker side to her personality and the lyrics were highly personal. The recording sessions could stretch way into the night and it was a fight for Kylie to make this album, but it was also what she wanted, full control. Faith can be cruel and the release of this album was to be an unhappy event; one week before the release Princess Diana died and the release was postponed. The album would be re-named due to Diana’s death and would be Kylie’s third eponymous album, simply named Kylie Minogue, the same name as her last release as well, it only retained its original name in Australia however.    “Impossible Princess”  was a flop, none of the singles entered the Top 20 in any major Chart Lists, the album would do quite well in Australia, but in Europe it completely flopped. It was, and still is, her greatest critical success, it was received well by critics and is considered by “Q Magazine” one of the hidden gems of the 90s. It was the audience that abounded her, they where unwilling to accept a more serious, darker and complex Kylie.   The album is  truly a hidden treasure; its best track “Breathe” is a soothing, dark and dreamlike song, which showcases Kylie’s song writing capabilities. “Did it Again” is also an extremely well written song, released with one of her best videos to date and a song that has a lot of attitude. “Impossible Princess” is a dark and complex affair; it challenges the listener and shows that even pretty girls can have “deeper feelings”.   If you ever  want to silence your mates when they say Kylie is overrated or un-talented, put this record on and they won’t even believe it is Kylie that is on.    urlLink The Official Kylie Site

       Madonna’s album “Music” is by many recognized as her “proof of artistic integrity, but her boldest artistic statement was perhaps the almost forgotten 1992 release “Erotica”.       Madonna’s fame  was at its peak in the early 90s, with the release of her best selling greatest hits album “The Immaculate Collection” in 1990 and her infamous “Blond Ambition World Tour” that same year. She became even more notoriously famous with the release of her photo book “Sex” in 1992, which totally overshadowed her album release that same year.   “Erotica” was automatically  linked with her book “Sex” and was slaughtered by critics all over the world. “Erotica” was Madonna’s downfall and, though over 3 million copies where sold, considered a flop. She mustered a successful worldwide tour, based on “Erotica”, in 1993 named “The Girlie Show”, but yet the album was looked at as her worst effort so far, only surpassed by “Bedtime Stories” in 1994.   But “Erotica” was  too harshly treated and prejudged by her ventures outside the record studio and was never given a fear treatment. “Erotica” is perhaps Madonna’s most truthful artistic statement and though the title might seem a bit dubious, it has many qualities that show what she is good for. Only 4 out of 14 tracks is explicitly about sex, most of the songs is about love, understanding and the overall theme is about being non-judgemental.    The album  is also her greatest tribute to the gay community, maybe not in the style of the music, but in her lyrics. “Why’s It So Hard” is a song about mankind’s difficulty in accepting people who think and love differently. She addresses the issue of loosing close friends to AIDS in her highly personal ballad “In This Life”.    The very style  of the music is a bold choice for an artist who is famed for making streamlined pop and in retrospect one can see that “Erotica” was a sign for what was to come, her extraordinary comeback album “Ray of Light” in 1998. Madonna was experimenting with music in ways she had never done before and this was done quit successfully. The album is not “easy” to approach, it is an album one has to really listen to and let it grow on you. The main problem with “Erotica” is that it is a bit too long, all songs except one (“Bye Bye Baby”) goes on for over 5 minutes which can be a bit tedious in the long run.    “Erotica” is  like a good vintage red vine, it gets better and better as the years pass and is a hidden treasure in Madonna’s vast back catalogue.    urlLink The Official Madonna Site

       Two women of dramatically different social, economic, and ethnic circumstances find themselves locked into a bitter child custody dispute in this emotionally powerful drama       Jessica Lange  at her very best in this strong drama from 1995, a year after her Oscar winning performance in ‘Blue Sky’. ‘Losing Isaiah’ also stars Halle Berry in one of her better works of the early- and mid-nineties, though the experienced Jessica Lange overshadows her.   The moral  dilemmas and questions of wrong and right is one of the key features in this film that never received great reviews when it was released, which comes as a surprise when one watches the heartbreaking scenes when Lange and Berry battles for the custody of Isaiah.

       ’ABBA Gold’ has to be one of the greatest album sensations in music history, which other band releases an greatest hits collection ten years after they stopped recording music and sells over 22 million copies? The follow up ‘More ABBA Gold’ did very well considering that it did not have many major hits on it and on the track list you find the hidden gem; ‘I am the City’      The previously unreleased recording ‘I am the City’ dating back to ABBA’s final recording sessions in 1982 can only hint about what ABBA’s ninth album could have been like. With the singles ‘Cassandra’, ‘The day before you Came’ and ‘Under Attack’ this song was supposed to be on the now so infamous ‘Opus 10’ album that ABBA never finished.  ‘I am the City’ has to be one of their strongest recordings ever and this almost dreamlike song gives hardcore ABBA fans, like myself, shivers down our spines, knowing that it was recorded at the very end of this great bands existence. It is also a continuation of the style developed on the 1981 album release ‘The Visitors’ and shows that ABBA was developing and exploring new musical territories.  Put ‘I am the City’ on and do not get surprised if your friends have no idea who is singing, because this track is quite different from what you are used to from this band.    urlLink The Official ABBA Site

       The first Hollywood movie to ever adress 'Teenagers' was 'A Place in The Sun' (1951)      'A Place in The Sun' is a 50s classic and reconzied as one as well, but still many people have 'forgotten' this melodrama. Ever wondered why Elizabeth Taylor is so famous? Then this is one of many movies that can explain it to you, she was 17 when she made this movie, but already a fullgrown woman and the most beautiful woman to ever grace the silver screen.  Before Marlon Brando and James Dean there was Montgomery Clift, an extraordinary actor and very good looking. Taylor would later say that it was on the set of this movie and her encounter with Clift that made her take movie making seriously.

         Shortly before the Norwegian pop phenomenon M2M called it quits they released their second and best album.      Marian and Marion felt it was time to end M2M after their second album ‘The Big Room’ flopped. Their legacy is however a well produced, self written album from two teenagers.  The best tracks on this album is the single release ‘Everything’, the bitchy ‘Miss Popular’ and the powerful ‘Leave me Alone’. This is not a great album, but a good in the middle of the road album that you do not have to be ashamed to have in your CD collection.

       Mylene Farmer is huge star in France and got a renaissance in Europe when Kate Ryan made Farmer's former hits 'Désenchantée' and 'Libertine' into huge dance hits in 2002/03.      You don't have to understand what someone is singing about to reconise good pop and that is exactly what Mylene Farmer has to offer. Her greatest hits (double) album from 2001 is packed with great music and it is not hard to understand why she is a big star in the French speaking parts of Worldolrd.  Farmer's greatest songs has a certain grandness to them, 'Désenchantée', 'C'est une Belle Journée' and 'Souviens-Toi du Jour' has all the same quality of effortlessly build themselves up to smooth grand finales. French pop music is not like American or Australian pop, the productions are more flat and sometimes it is hard to know where the chorus starts and end.   French being the most language in the world is presentedwhispering whispring sensuality of Mylene Farmer in a 30 track long journey through her career.

       Former Take That member Mark Owen makes a strong comeback with 'In Your Own Time'      The general idea when Take That, England's biggest pop-sensation since The Beatles, broke up in 1996 was that Mark Owen (and not Robbie Williams) would be the one who would do good as a solo artist. Mark Owen's 1996 solo debut 'Green Man' was promesing and did good on the charts, but he never came up with a follow up and the world was soon under the spell of Robbie Williams.  Mark Owen wanted to find his 'own voice' and become a better songwriter before he would return to the record studio and that is what happened in 2003. Sometimes you have to wait a long time for something good and this is the case with Mark Owen's 2004 release 'In Your Own Time' is exactly that, something good.  This is britpop in its purest form, highly addictive and well produced. Mark as a singer has developed and he proves himself as a very capable songwriter. This is one of those albums where you push 'play' and just let it play from first to last track: This is easy going, well written music, where no particular song stands out as greater than the other.

       A sing/songwriter album that you just have to have.        Aimee Mann’s work   inspired screenwriter and director Paul Thomas Anderson to make the 90s classic ‘Magnolia’ (1999) starring Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise. This was the peak of her fame, though she has a loyal following, she has never really broken into the charts in the same manor as her peers like Jewel and Sheryl Crow. This is a shame since she is one of the best recording sing/songwriters of today.     ‘BACHELOR NO. 2   or, the last remains of the dodo’ is a delightful and extraordinary album from the same year Mann recorded the soundtrack for ‘Magnolia’ and though similar in style, ‘Bachelor No. 2’ has far more intimacy and is working better as an album in whole. The album features 14 great tracks including four of the best tracks from ‘Magnolia’. Put it on, play it through, and find yourself mesmerised.

       The Australian rock band Youth Group has released a solid album with ‘Skeleton Jar’.       Sydney's Youth Group  is starting to make quite a name for themselves. Their nineties grunge take on sixties pop/rock has managed to swing the words 'youth' and 'group' into the street press all around Australia.   I was present  at the album release of ‘Skeleton Jar’ just before Easter and I was mesmerised by this Australian band. This is straightforward guitar pop/rock with emphasis on melancholy and the title track is one of the best songs I’ve heard this year. GET IT.

       WAO!!! This have to be the best Britney Spears has done, still commercial, still sexy, but this time a bit better music. 4.5 out of 6 stars from me.       What can I say?  This is good, Britney shows for the first time that she in control of her career and she is taking a couple of steps in the right direction.   Her last album  "Britney" was a definitive high, but if you (as me) isn’t that crazy about R&B then her new album "In the Zone" is a much more pleasant acutance. My first thought was that the graphic designers at her record company should have worked more on this terrible cover, "Britney" showcased a good cover design, this is amateur work. But music wise I was first extremely disappointed, her duet with Madonna "Me Against the Music" is NOT a good song and why, oh why, she has released this as the first single I don’t know. Well, I do know, because it is a song featuring Madonna, but that is just not good enough. Then comes yet another boring piece of work "(I Got That) Boom Boom" and you just think, the girl has lost it and you are so close to give her up and start listening to Christina Aguilera.   But then  the album takes a huge U-turn and the the 3d song "Showdown" takes you to the core of the album. This is saucy, sexy, sleek techno pop, not far from what you are used to from Kylie Minogue. "Breathe on Me" is truly a delightful song and this is when you realize that she is doing a Madonna. SEX is the word and in 1992 Madonna released her underrated "Erotica" album, and Britney’s "In the Zone" is in many ways the 2003 version of "Erotica". But where Madonna got down and dirty, Britney makes it light and sleek.    A string of songs   comes along, maybe not the biggest variations in theme and tune, but who cares? When you buy Britney you are not expecting a Kate Bush or Tori Amos, if you do you have big problem. I just have to give this album 4.5 stars because it is a good pop album and she gets an extra star just because I am so impressed.   "In the Zone"  has many rip-offs, there is defiantly some Mirwais inspiration here (he has worked on Madonna’s two last albums), there’s Madonna vibes and a lot of Kylie Minogue (if that is intentioned, I do not know, but it’s there).

       One of the true masterpieces in film history         Norwegian film star Liv Ullmann   in her Ingmar Bergman debut,  is phenomenal. She sparkles alongside renowned Swedish actress Bibbi Anderson in this intense drama about an actress who refuses to talk (Ullmann) and her relationship with the nurse (Anderson) who is looking after her.    ‘Persona’ (1968) is the   Greek word for mask and the film questions the differences between one’s outer and inner life. Bergman has never explained the film, saying it is up to the viewer to find the meaning of the film. Ullmann can convey a range of feelings without uttering one word, which is quite a task and she is just fantastic in this film. Want to see something different? Challenge yourself a bit? Then watch this Swedish masterpiece which is amongst the best films ever made.

        It is not often people even consider watching a Bollywood film, but 'Straight from the Heart' (original title 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam') is a very good and romantic musical from the country in the world that produces and watch most films in the world.       A classic Bollywood love story  feutering some of the biggest stars in India. The plot is a typical love triangle, with many and good song and dance numbers, which is the essence of any big Bollywood production.   The film feuteres   the exceptional Indian beauty and former 'Miss World' Aishwarya Rai, which has proven herself as an actress in some big Bollywood productions since the late 90s.      The worst feutere  in this film is the extrem overplay by the male lead Salman Khan, which only has his good looks to play on. Things gets far better when the second male lead, Ajay Devgan, enters the scene and just because Devgan is a far superior actor compared to Khan, you just whish with all your heart that Miss Rai will end up with Devgan.

       Euro-disco at its best and funniest         Baccara was never   a good band, they sung BAD English and many of the songs where just crap. Nevertheless, they had a couple of genius disco tunes in the late 70s: ‘Yes Sir, I Can Boogie’ and ‘Sorry I’m a Lady’ is still amongst the greatest Euro-Disco songs ever recorded. These two songs where huge chart-toppers in the lat 70s and though the two Spanish girls became just another ‘one hit wonder’ their two hits has stood the test of time. Baccara is a disco act you put on for fun and party, the camp effect is huge.

      Who knows why, but it is no secret....if the Beckhams were to walk into the room right now I would faint. At 15 the Spice Girls burst onto the scene with one of the ultimate girl anthems. I have always been a romantic. I believe in the power of fairytales, but something was always left out - that women have rights and deserve not only to be loved but to be respected. Finally it was ok to refuse to accept the patriarchy of society. Women everywhere started wearing platform shoes (although not me, I am tall enough) and saying what they thought. The Spice Phenomenon swept the world in a way not unlike Brit boybands, they are still one of the highest selling girl groups of all time and created a music genre all of their own.  Posh Spice was not the most loved member of the band. She didn't sing solo on their first single and received the tag of "untalented". Despite brilliant performances in many of their hit singles this tag remains today. Yet many years after the band split, she is the most photographed woman of our time. Why? The reason is quite simply the man she married - David Beckham!  The man of the hour, Goldenballs is adored like no other footballer has ever been. The reality is that we globally know who he is because he married a Spice Girl, but we remember him because he is the greatest footballer of four time.

           IN THE NEWS          As you look through the articles linked below you will notice one very important point - the Beckhams make the news even if they have nothing important to contribute. Whilst Victoria's visit to Peru is at least for the good of others, the main issue at the moment is David's new tattoo (if only I could get a picture to see what it looks like). It must be nice to live in a world where that is the greatest concern of the day.         news.com.au        urlLink Posh denies  May 24, 2004      urlLink Its David Neckham  May 23, 2004      urlLink Posh suffers home defeat  May 22, 2004       bbc.co.uk        urlLink Beckham charity trip  May 23, 2004      urlLink Beckham tipped to shine  May 23, 2004       cnn.com        urlLink Beckham sticks neck out  May 21, 2004      urlLink Beckham staying at Real  May 20, 2004

        Last night as I was listening to 2DayFM there were some funny little titbits on the Beckhams which I thought I would share with you.     According to Jackie O News on the &quot;Kyle and Jacki O Show&quot; the Beckhams have converted to Kabbalah. They were apparently photographed wearing the red bracelet. This trend seems to have gone nuts, so many celebrities are converting to Kabbalah recently including Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore, Madonna, and Britney Spears.     Alexis on the &quot;Hot30&quot; claims that Victoria has weaved some of David's hair into her hair extensions. I have no idea why anyone would say this about them but is a perfect example of the crazy things that the press will say to get your attention - well it got mine.

       In the June 2004 Cleo (on sale now) there is an article on stalking. The only reason this is of note is becuase they list the Beckhams as reportedly being the most stalked couple in the world. When you think about it this is a fairly accurate and terribly frightening statistic. There have been at least three kidnap attempts on the lives of Victoria, Brooklyn and Romeo and a number of death threats for the couple.  Why? What is the reason for all these threats on their lives? Personally, I think it has something to do with David's constant acknowledgement that he would do anything to protect his wife and children. I draw this conclusion from the fact that it is never David that they want to kidnap, but rather it is to him that they address any demands (I read somewhere - can't remember where - that one of the kidnappers were going to ask for millions of pounds to let them go). It is a money making scheme which unfortunately puts the people he loves most in the world in danger - what man wouldn't pay?

        Move to Chelsea?    There have been a great number of recent rumours regarding the possible move of Becks back to English club Chelsea.   Through my readings I have discovered the following:  - Chelsea's owner will pay for him  - there is a presidential election coming up at Real and one of the candidates up for election is willing to listen to offers apparently  - talk it may be Ronaldo who Chelsea get, have read he would be happy to go if Becks does but nothing more  Will find more details as to whether he is going or not. More importantly, since the buy out clause in Becks contract with Real is so high why would anyone want him?

        UPDATE on the Rebecca Loos scandal, the poor girl has    been receiving death threats. Whilst I disagree with what she did (ie kissing    and telling) she does not deserve that. I'm sure however, that soon we will    have seen the last of her.      I think its important that after all the press that this    story initally received, most publications now seem pretty confident that the    Beckhams will stay together - there are even denied reports that Posh is expecting    baby number 3.

        I've linked some really great websites    for all things Beckham :) They include such things as his background and current    projects. Really importantly are some of the statistics that are included.    Because I have linked these sites I will not go into the information that they    provide. Instead i will focus on what they don't say, most particuarly the reason    for so many sites

      Article found on www.smh.com.au - goes to show that despite the recent scandals, David Beckham is still a highly bankable celebrity. I think its important to note that most of his earnings were from advertising. All advertising deals stem from this "Brand Beckham", which could almost be a product on its own.   Beckham tops soccer earnings May 4, 2004 - 9:00AM  England captain David Beckham has become the top paid footballer in the world earning 22.4 million euro ($37.27 million) last year, bi-weekly soccer magazine France Football reported.  The 28-year-old player's revenue was amassed from 6.4 million euro ($10.65 million) paid by his Spanish team Real Madrid, bonuses of 100,000 euro ($166,400), advertising deals estimated at 11.4m euro ($18.97m), advances for his autobiography worth 3m euro and 1.5m euro for his Asian tour.  The England star leads two other Real Madrid players in the earnings stakes, Brazilian striker Ronaldo and French midfielder Zinedine Zidane who earned 16.5m ($27.46m) and 14m euro ($23.3m) respectively.  Michael Owen is the highest-paid English Premiership player according to the report. The Liverpool striker earns 9.1 million euro ($15.14 million) while Thierry Henry, whose goals have been instrumental in winning Arsenal the Premiership this season is on 8.4 million euro ($13.98 million).  Alex Ferguson is the top paid manager with the Manchester United boss earning 8.6 euro ($14.31m), ahead of England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson with 5.5 million euro ($9.15 million) and AS Roma's Fabio Capello on 4.1m ($6.82m).  Arsene Wenger, who led Arsenal to the Premiership title, earned 3.4m ($5.66).  AFP

      Happy Birthday to Becks for yesterday!  Fortunately doesn't appear as though your birthday was ruined by a new scandal the way Vitoria's 30th was. Hope you got great gifts....although no idea what you would buy a Beckham for their birthday, would they not have everything?

       urlLink Mrs Beckham keeps her distance    How to wind friends and influence people Victoria Beckham style...this time involves being on her own. Definitely not a strategy I would take. THis article is claiming that Victoria will be staying at a seperate place to all the other partners of England footballers. Now if the rumours are true and she is already excluded from much of the activities that these partners do together I would have thought staying with them would have been a better idea. Not my call I guess, but still this girl needs to stop giving tabloids ammunition against her. If she doesn't want to be portrayed as a spolit pop star then perhaps she needs to be seen in environments with normal people.

              David Beckham has repeatidly stated that the most important thing in his life is his family,  particularly his boys. he is obviously very protective of them as there are few photos available of these kids. But Brooklyn most definitely has his dad's looks and charm, whilst Romeo is very similar to Victoria.  Rumour: trying for a little girl, have at least admitted they want more kids but personally I think that until they are both a little more relaxed about their careers it will be hard to give any more children the time they deserve with both parents.

         When I first started writing this Blog, the Beckhams were in the midst of the biggest crisis of their careers. The annoucement of the affair with Rebecca Loos was thought to be the beginning of the end for both their career and their marriage. Why wasn't it??  Victoria seems to have come off the worst of all this. Portrayed as the selfish wife who wants to work on a solo career which so far has not been a huge international success. Much of the media (particularly in the UK) blamed her for the affair. Rebecca Loos even admited in her interview with BSkyB that she would never have had an affair if there wasn't room in David's bed. Many agreed that such a strong family man, when missing his family so greatly would try to recreate that feeling with another. even down to such details as Rebecca using Victoria's bathroom products. Despite what the media presumed would be the end she stood by him, and for the first time was seen smiling.  David, at the same time, has been portrayed both as the betraying husband and the man deserted by his own wife. Its hard to know if he actually did cheat on his wife with Rebecca Loos because there are so many conflicting tales in teh tabloids, one thing is certain his image as a beloved family man has not been tarnished the way it was originally thought to be.  The marriage seems to have survived and so has the brand. What more could they want?  NB: picture included in this post was taken after the news of the affair broke oout - they look pretty happy to me.

         After much talk of Becks it is only fitting to mention Posh.  She has always been my favourite Spice Girl. I wanted her wardrobe and she is most definitely the mot stylish woman in Britain at the moment (gosh she even won an award for it). More importantly despite the allegations of affairs, and the hatred of the British media Victoria has remained the most glamourous and down to earth celebrity on the planet.  In an interview on Parkinson I was suprised to listen to her talk about how normal this couple is. They do all the normal things that couple's do and as a mum she has all the normal concerns, just on a much larger scale.  Victoria Beckham is a woman who deserves our admiration and respect, after all that she has been through to get her man she deserves him - I hope he makes her happy.

      Finally this week photos of David Beckhams latest tattoo has been revealed. As the articles (which i have included in a previous blog) discussed much criticism was targeted at the iconography behind the tattoo - it features a cross with wings. Whilst the design is actually quite beautiful, I personally think that having the tattoo on the back of his neck is rather unattractive. Perhaps if he had put it elsewhere, but where the man apparently already has 6 tattoos that I can think of.  I remember reading an article something ages ago that said that Becks has all these tattoos so that when you look at him you see what is important to him - namely his family. Whilst this is true and a beautiful gesture this is definitely a sign of a bigger trend regarding getting tattoos that mean something to you rather than simply just being anything. I wonder what he will get tattooed where next

       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Have you ever noticed how Becks is better known for his celebrity endorsements than his football skills? Ever noticed how we remember his offfield antics more than his onfield ones? Ever wondered why?    As part of this assesment I did a random sample survey of friends and family regarding the above questions and the answer is simple....what he does offfield is far more interesting than onfield.    Despite being known by Man Utd fans for some time before, it is his relationship with a Spice Girl that brought him to the world and the medias attention. In 1997 he met and fell for Posh Spice (Victoria Adams) and his life has never been the same. The Spice Girls were at the height of their success when they met and their future seemed certain to be a happy one. As a result of her pop star status his new girlfriend, and eventually his wife, introduced him to a world outside of the football field. But more importantly, all on his own, he set out to differenitate himself from the crowd and became recognised as the first meterosexual celebrity. (think sarong, nail polish, and all the hair cuts)    His transformation from talented footballer to sex symbol did not happen overnight. Early photos of himself and Victoria show that the man did not always have the style he is recoginised for now but it was the early 90s so we should be tolerant). His sending off during an Argentina game made him for a time the most hated man in England. It is believed that the first kidnapp attempt against his family was the catalyst for the media to back down. Since then Goldenballs can do no wrong (look at how Victoria was blamed for his alleged affair with Rebecca Loos).     An article about the Beckhams will always sell papers. It is this fact that means they are constantly followed by paparizzi where ever they go. Whilst this press attention has led to the huge endorsement contracts that the couple have received, it has also lead to the death and kidnap threats that have plagued their relationship. No other couple, since Prince Charles and the late Pricess Diana have held a nation (and the world's) attention so consistently for so long.     Becks is now known as one of the world's most beautiful men, the best dressed man in England, a loving husband and father and a talented footballer.     Will Posh and Becks always be remembered the way that they are now? It is up to the history books to decide how to represent this culturally significant couple, we will have to wait and see.

       "Let me Adjust my Toungebox"     "Barbarella - The Queen of the Galaxy" was made in 1968 by the french director Roger Vadim. Vadim asked his wife to play the main part...often not such a good idea (!) even when that is aerobics queen Jane Fonda. This film really made me laugh, it is both intentionally and unintentionally funny (I think...) I am not sure what the film was trying to be, but the message is clear: Make Love Not War! (With angels and aliens if you can...) It's a sci fi swinging sixties show with a gruesome soundtrack. The costumes are fantastic. The dialouge is hilarious. Barbarella walks around "the universe" in some fantastic outfits, including a skunk suit...    THE PLOT  It is year 40 000. Barbarella is floating around and taking her clothes off in her red spaceship (complete with orange shag-carpet) when she gets The President of the Earth (!) on her videophone. He needs her to find the evil scientist Duran Duran and discover where he is hiding his terrible weapon, The Positronic Ray. This could destroy the harmony of the galaxy where Peace & Love has reigned for years. (Yep, it was made in the sixties...)   But why her? Well, she is the only five star, double-rated astronautical aviatrix available! She doesn't start off very well though. Her spaceship crashes and she is captured by cruel children, but saved by The Catchman. She repays him by making love...the "old fashioned way". (In the 41. century, making love is done by taking a pill and holding hands, as it was proved to be "distracting for maximum efficiency".)   Barbarella meets a blind angel, Pygar, who doesn't make love, he IS love (!) Together they fly to the city of Sogo. Here everyone walks around in vintage French S&M gear, if they are not chilling out, smoking "The Essence of Man" (from a large bong with an actual man floating around in it...)    Barbarella is almost killed several times, by man-eating dolls or evil canary birds. The Excessive Machine (AKA Orgasmatron) tries to kill her with too much pleasure!       "When I reach the cresendo you will die with pleasure! Your death will be swift but sweet. Very sweet."     In the end she discovers Duran Duran, runs around in psychedelic landscapes for a while and finally saves the universe from being swallowed by an evil lava lamp monster.   WHO WROTE THIS DIALOGUE?  Pygar is captured by...well, someone evil and Barbarella comes to his rescue: "Decrucify the angel, or I'll melt you face!" The Tyrant:  "You're very pretty pretty pretty' Barbarella: "My name isn't pretty pretty, It's Barbarella!'

       A Story of Fishes     Using your wife for the main part is never a good idea: just watch Swept Away from 2002. The director is Guy Richie, and the wife is (of course) Madonna. This film made me laugh AND feel embarrassed on their behalf. How could he go from making Snatch and Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels to...this? Was he trying to be funny? Was it all a joke? One thing I'm sure of, is that Madonna had more than a little to with it. As usual she is playing basically herself. The best bits are when she dances around with a fish, a rabbit, some fruit and a motorbike. Once the couple in love appear to ascend above the palm trees and fly horizontally across the sunset...    THE PLOT 3 filthy rich couples on a cruise in the Mediterranean. Amber is the spoiled and nasty wife of a drug baron ("he's in chemicals"...) who treats Beppe (an Italian crew member) really bad on board the ship. She orders him around, treating him like a slave. Then guess what happens? The two of them get stuck on a deserted island, and here the roles are reversed... The Italian fisherman can catch fish with his hands and Amber obviously can't, so she becomes his slave! Among the things she has to do for him is sing and dance and call him Master...and after a while they fall in love (of course..?)   Let's build a home. Right here! The former rich bitch turned nature child Amber does not want to leave her Italian stallion or their Island. But he wants to test if she can love him in "the real world", so they go back to civilisation...and Amber decides to stay with her husband! The moral is: Stay with the guy who's got the money!   WHO WROTE THIS DIALOGUE?  The captain tells Amber that Foking is the name of a fish in Italian: "Well I don't care if it's foking, puking or a fxxxing kung-fu king, I want that fish and I want it tonight!" Amber tells Beppe she loves him: "But if you hadn't been shipwrecked, you would still be a rich and happy American wife, and I would still be a poor, Italian, happy fisherman."

       We Love Barbarella:   All these people watched the film and loved it:  Kylie Minogue copied the opening scene's zero gravity space strip in her video for "Put yourself in my place" in 1994. The Eighties pop band Duran Duran took their name from ... yep you guessed it: The evil scientist Duran Duran.     The Matmos is the name of the evil energy liquid form that almost wipes out the universe in Barbarella. Are these people also inspired by the film?   urlLink MATMOS    Luc Besson's "The fifth element" (1997) with it's fantastically fashionable outer space (costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier), females dressed in minimalist plastic and The ultimate evil threatening to destroy the universe was also inspired by Barbarella.    You go girl!  (Besson and Milla Jovovich, who play Leeloo invented the language spoken by Leeloo in “Fifth Element”. By the end of filming they were able to have full conversations in this language!)    urlLink LEARN LEELOO'S LANGUAGE

       The king of B films   "Things haven't been going great lately. For a while now people haven't really been getting my movies. Certainly the box office hasn't been up to speed. Sure, some of my recent stuff hasn't been perfect, but neither has it been the shit that many have said. Critically, it's all become a bit of a crapshoot. The critics thought I was a bum when I started out and they think I'm a bum now."  Said John Carpenter, the maker of a number of Bad Films such as Big trouble in Little China, Ghosts on Mars from 2001: "You don't stand a ghost of a chance" and The Fog from 1980: "What you can't see won't hurt you...it'll kill you!"

       Beware of Chinatown!     Big Trouble In Little China from 1986 is so bad that it is funny. It's directed by John Carpenter, who must be mad! It features Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall (Samantha from Sex in the City. I bet she's proud of tis one...) a 2000 year old Chinese transvestite, a flying one eyed blob, a hairy monster and a lot of really crap martial arts fight scenes. Kurt Russell's wears his west tucked into his jeans, which are pulled up almost to his armpits, a mullet haircut and boots that can shoot knifes. He is the coolest guy in town. "No horse shit" Jack Burton.   THE PLOT  We are in San Francisco, where Jack the all American macho truck driver goes to the airport with his Chinese buddy, Wang, to pick up his fiancee coming from China. He meets a mysterious female lawyer he fancies while the girlfriend is kidnapped by a China town street gang "The Lords of Death"(!) They are dressed in the ultimate 80's "thug" gear: Headbands, Michael Jackson style leather jackets and enormous sunglasses. In trying to rescue her, Jack and Wang come into all sorts of trouble (as you do...) It turns out the fiancee is captured by Lo Pan, a 2000 year old evil magician who rules an empire of spirits beneath San Fran's Chinatown. He can only return to a mortal life if he marries a girl with green eyes.(It has taken him 2000 years to find that apparently). Gracie the lawyer also has green eyes, and is captured as well, Lo Pan decides to marry them both after all those lonely years...    The guys get help from an old Chinese man named Egg (!) and make their way through the sewer underground to the Wing Kong Exchange where Lo Pan has started the wedding ceremony. They have to get through 3 guys with supernatural powers wearing lampshades on their heads and shooting electricity out of their fingers, the Room of the Upside-Down Hell and a whole lot of black magic monsters. And what happens in the end? The bad guy dies, Jack and Gracie fall in love, Chinatown is once again a safe place...and Jack hits the road again.   WHO WROTE THIS DIALOGUE?  Jack complains about the loss of his truck, Wang says: "How do you think I feel Jack? I lost the whole girl!" Toasting a drink that will give them supernatural powers in the rescue: Wang: "Here's to the army and navy, and the battle's they have won, here's to America's colours, the colours that never run." Jack: "May the wings of liberty never loose a feather." Egg while explaining some "Chinese history": "Anybody who showed up was going to join Lim Lee in the Hell of Being Cut to Pieces. Jack: "Hell of what?" Egg: "Chinese have a lot of hells."

       It's Turkey Time!       THE PLOT  We meet Larry Gigli (it rhymes with really...) played by Ben Affleck: a "tough talking" gangster. His mobster boss asks Gigli to kidnap the younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor, to save him from going to jail. (Eh…Right.) The brother has "certain physiological defects" and is in mental hospital. But Gigli just walks in there, picks him up and walks straight out again. (Wow.) Back at his apartment, Ricky (Jennifer Lopez) knocks on the door...She has been hired to oversee the operation, as Gigli's boss doesn't trust him to do the job properly. Gigli is a little offended about this:  "If you want to talk about reputations and it by some fxxxing miracle long shot you haven't heard of my reputation, let me tell you who the fxxx I am. I am the fxxxing Satan of Slick, Sadie. I am the Rule of fxxxing Cool. You wanna be a gangster? You wanna be a thug? You sit at my fxxxing feet. Gather the pearls that emanate forth from me. Because I'm the fxxxing original, straight-first-foremost-pimp-mack fxxxing hustler, original gangster's gangster!"  Pheeeew. And that's just the beginning. The film's dialogue is so long and unnatural, and it made me feel more and more embarrassed. Not too mention when they start talking about why Ricky is a lesbian. They are discussing the pros and cons of female and male anatomy while she is doing yoga on the floor!! It's NOT very sexy at all. And then...they fall in love. But wasn't she a lesbian? Not after a night with Gigli of course. The most embarrassing scene of all is when Jennifer spreads her legs and goes: "Gobble, Gobble- it's turkey time!" Watch it, and cringe!    Why did you agree to do this movie Jen?    I did it cause you were in it...Oh shut up! I don't want to marry you anyway!

        The Worst Film Of All Time?        THE PLOT  "Future events such as these will affect you in the future." The movie starts with TV psychic Criswell preparing us for what we are about to see: "You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable, that is why you are here...We're all interested in the future for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives." Clever words. And then the film starts with a funeral where mysterious things start to happen. The story was built around a few minutes of Bela Lugosi footage before he died. Bela Lugosi was a friend of the film's director Edward Wood Junior, and is famous for playing Dracula, Vampires and any other kind of evil. The rest of the film his character "The elderly man" was actually played by a chiropractor friend of the director, hiding his face with a cape...      The story is basically that the UFO's are coming to earth to destroy us humans before our scientists discover a bomb that will explode sunlight, and then use it to destroy the universe. They have been trying for a while, as they have now come as far as Plan number 9. Plan 9 is the resurrection of the dead. (In order to destroy humanity they manage to resurrect no less than 3 zombies...)             The "aliens" are dressed in satin suits and greet each other by crossing their arms. Night constantly changes till day and back again, the flying saucers made of paper plates. There are long silences, like the actors has forgot their lines, footage of military in tanks shooting (probably taken from the war) is used in between shots of "Kernel Edwards in charge of the saucer field activity". A long list of mistakes if you're interested:    urlLink PLAN 9 MISTAKES     ED WOOD WROTE THIS DIALOGUE...  Paula: "Saucers? You mean the kind from up there?"    Jeff: "Modern women. They have been like that through the ages."  The detective: "Inspector Clay is dead! Murdered! And someone's responsible!"   His excellency (the chief alien): "The earth people cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking around again, brought to life by our advancement in such things."  Jeff: "So what if we do develop this Solaranite bomb? We'd be even a stronger nation than now." Eros the Alien: "'Stronger.' You see? You see? Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!"   In the end, the narrator comes out with this: "My friend. You have seen this incident, based on sworn testimony. Can you prove that it didn't happen? Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space. Many scientists believe we are being watched right now...We once laughed at the horse less carriage, the airplane, telephones, electrical light, vitamins, radio and even television. And now some of us laugh at outer space! God help us in the future.

      Plan 9 from outer space IS probably the worst film ever. (It certainly has got "The worst film ever" award at least once). It's been a while - probably 10 years, since I saw this film, but the thing I remember best, is the fact that the humans and the aliens couldn't understand each other, even though they were all speaking english. Hilarious :) Also, the same scene, were Bela Lugosi comes out of the forest, is used 5 or 6 times I think. And each time it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot or with the scene directly preceding it. It sure makes you wonder if Ed Wood was on an acid trip or something? He just couldn't be fully conscious when making this film.

I mean, really, can you think of one 'rcokstar' of note with a polite, lovely and generally palattable attitude? Or would that make them too 'boring' or 'weird', not in keeping with the societal idea of 'the rockstar'? The rockstar, after all,  has   to get drunk,  has   to insult other bands in order to  be   a rockstar. Rockstars, too, are allowed to do things we plebians aren't. Many perform drunk, half asleep or just plain badly, and are still revered as genius. But really, if it were any other way, everyone would be a rockstar and there'd be no societal division between those of us who  are   and those of us who  aren't .   Besides, I don't think the public would buy the album of a band whose songs go something like this:  "The world is so beautiful/Let's all dance around in a circle/Hold hands and pick flowers"   , and whose idea of 'rocking out' is  cleaning   the instruments insteading of smashing them.

         So I was looking through my photo album today, and I noticed this one of Paul Dempsey urlLink (Something For Kate) 's feet, and I wondered what Mr. Dempsey would think if he saw it:   a). I'm a freak b). I'm a stalker/groupie c). I have a foot fetish  or d). All of the above rolled into one freaky package of strangeness.   If you answered d, CONGRATULATIONS! you were correct! Please click  urlLink here  to claim your prize.  We've all been starstruck at one stage of our lives. We've all had posters of   urlLink The Vines / urlLink Jet / urlLink Avril Lavigne ,  (one and the same to me)   urlLink Molly Meldrum  or  urlLink Kerry-Anne Kennerly    (in my mind slightly more talented than those above)  and dreamed of a life less ordinary.  A life on the other side of the barrier. But what makes a 'star' a 'star'? Why do we care what Johnny Depp ate for lunch? Why do we want to know that Nicole Kidman's dog cheated on it's wife? Obviously there is a huge market for this, and the success of magazines life NW and Who Weekly (along with the fact that I have a link to Billy Corgan(Smashing Pumpkins)'s blog on this very page..sshhhh!) is testament to this. Whether it's a vicarious longing to be someone else, or simply an interest in that particular person's art, varies greatly from person to person. But when 'stars' become more than human, a real problem arises, and double standards emerge as second nature.  Michael Jackson can afford the best lawyers and therefore can avoid jail (at least for now),  Footballers can get away with murder (literally) and not get chastised,  and our favourite stars can cheat on their wives (hello Becks) and remain in our shrines.  Fame certainly is a strange thing, just ask the girl next to me at Eskimo Joe whose shirt was signed NO LESS than 8 times by each member of the band  on seperate occasions , and left 10 minutes before it ended so she could 'secure a place near the exit'.  And don't you think...   Gotta go! I think I just saw Winona Ryder's cousin's best friend's mum!

         Trapped in the crowd nameless, faceless, pushing shoving an elbow in my side. Screaming, singing, lost anonymous trapped held. Violent jerk  to the left right pushes me over, lose my balance scared, trapped, can’t breathe.  falling into the sea, succumbing to the shuffle of feet the wailing and howling, a kick in the head the ground. The oceanic mass dragging  me along the vacuum of a thousand singers, players, best friends eyes close hope for the best.     ---   It's always amazed me how 'mosh politics' work. People you'd never associate with on a daily basis become your best "OH MY GOD! THEY'RE PLAYING MY SONG" buddies (cue above photo - do you think I'd normally be great buddies with the scary bald man who proceeded to spill bourbon all over me?), and the scene above  becomes euphoria instead of fear and anguish. So many times I've let myself get trampled on  hit punched crowd surfed on and enjoyed it. It's a rush, and, no less, it's not as fun  without the bruises.   The crowd becomes one vast oceanic mass, where no one knows anything about you except perhaps your taste in music...or your desire to get beaten up by a crowd surfer  wearing boots .  Maybe the thrill is that anonymity, your ability to escape  reality.  No one cares if you're failing school, your best friend hates you, you got fired. You're just another fan in the sea of wannabe stage divers.  Or maybe the thrill is the knowledge that if you fall, you'll always be saved by some huge hairy bloke holding a can of bourbon & coke.  But why can't this intense sense of community exist in other walks of life? The world would be full of much happier (albeit black and blue) people.  That old woman who snarled at me on the bus this morning would be  happy  that the bus jerked and I invaded her personal space. Four young people wouldn't  have  to stand up just because one old man needs a seat..they could all share in bruisng glory.  'Personal Space' doesn't exist in mosh pits, except in the form of spiked accessories and protective boyfriends, and the sweaty shirtless men no one wants to go near.  And thank God for that.  For now, though, I think I'll stick to a world where personal space and ettiquette exist..it scares me to think that one day I could be on a bus, squished against the chest of a bald, sweaty man  holding a can of bourbon & coke.

         [[6:00pm ]]   It's my friend Kerry Elizabeth's 18th birthday and she wants to do something that both requires photo I.D. (which she now has) and the consumption of alcoholic beverages (which she is now allowed). So it's decided that  urlLink Eskimo Joe  is the way to go. Eskimo Joe, of course, being an Aussie band of no particular interest to me but of particular interest to Kerry Elizabeth. They're playing at the  urlLink Metro , George street, in 2 hours....and I don't have a ticket.  I know what you're thinking "what a bad friend! She didn't buy a ticket for her friend's 18th celebrations!" but go easy, keeping in mind the many obligations an Arts student has...y'know...arts, and stuff.     [[6:30pm ]]    Across the road from the Metro we're killing time at Utopia records, where my friend Adam makes his money and where many a cd is sold at 120% retail. Talking to said Adam, I realise I have a seemingly natural bias against Australian bands [[ "yeah...they're shit" ]] and, more broadly, Australian exports in general.. has anyone seen 'Take Away'? Well I have.   [[7:00pm ]]   Needless to say, then, at this point I'm not really crying and screaming and sharpeneing the blades at the no ticket situation. After all, we have a hotel down the road where I'll quite happily indulge in bad t.v. for a few hours until they return..but, as a dutiful friend, I stand outside the metro and don my best 'Hey! Scalpers!! I want your ticket!' face.   But I don't think it's working.   [[8:00pm ]]     Oh well, Given up hope, sorry Kerry Elizabeth...better luck next time, and stuff. That's $25 I guess I really did need for living, anyway. I'm about to walk off...when, low and behold, my 'Hey! Scalpers!! I want your ticket!' face has paid off and I'm holding a ticket in my hand courtesy of the two weird smelling girls to your left.  Oh, so, so happy with this development.  Cue the picture at the beginning of this entry.    [[9:00pm ]]   Maybe the cynic in me was too quick to judge and at this point I'm feeling rather good about my terrific luck with the afore mentioned ticket. I'm really getting into it, maybe I'm not their biggest fan...but maybe I'll buy the CD.   UNTIL   [[ 9:30pm ]]    Suddenly an elbow in my back signals the arrival of a noisy, smelly (seems to be a theme tonight..) , unsightly and generally freaky man who has pushed his way through the crowd because "I LOVE THESE GUYS! I MEAN...I REALLY LOVE THESE THREE GUYS!" So for the next two hours, I'm resigned to the fact that I've paid $25 to listen to a giant smelly man sing his heart out. It almost makes me wanna get out my lighter. Then he does.   [[ 11:00pm ]]   Unsightly giant or not, this show is proving an eye opener to someone who possibly fell into the 'cynicism is the new black' trap  urlLink Emma  mentioned. Talent overcomes the stinkiness of my friendly hobo and hey! He's even somewhat entertaining. What the hey! Aussie music rocks!  ----   [[ 2pm, the next day ]]  I bought the cd.   And this is all I have to say.

      Why is it, that what is music to one is noise to another? Are we individually tuned to a particular rhythm,  beat melody pitch? More likely it’s the culture we subscribe to, and which music most fits into our societal standing.  Ask my little brother why he walks around the house screaming “I’M SLIM SHAAAY-DEEE YESS I’M THA REEAL SHAY-DEEE” (and then pretends he’s the Ramones’ biggest fan “hey Soph, you know Jack Ramone? Did he die?” “err...there was no Jack in the Ramones..”) and the answer you’ll get is simple:  “Because I like it.”  Ask my big brother why  he  walks around singing “EASSY LOIKE SUNDAAAAY MORNENNNN YEEEEEAHA AHOOHHE EHE (don’t go there...) and the answer is inevitably similar "MAN!! BECAUSE MIKE PATTON IS GOD MAN!!"  (translation "Because I like it.") Ask them to swap headphones, though, and all you'll get is a face to rival the evil look coined by the cast of   the Bold and the Beautiful  .    Treasure: 1, Trash Nil.      Now this perplexes me greatly, as it totally negates the research I've done. Out of the 10 people whom I approached at Uni today and queried as to their taste in music, 8 people replied that they generally love all music. Asked whether they liked Eminem, and only 1 said yes. Asked whether they liked Delta Goodrem, and..well..for further reference, don't ever approach the socialist stall with such questons. So doesn't that say that  realistically , they  don't  love all music? I mean how can you love all music...but hate Eminem, Delta, Avril or Shaggy?     Trash: 1, Treasure: 1.    Music is like religion, only it doesn't (often) start wars: completely subjective.  So, if we all love and appreciate music, why is there such a great divide between genres? I've fallen into this trap as lately as today, when I got chatting to the guy next to me only to find out he was a massive fan of D-12. I judged him by his musical tastes, yet I myself am a believer in loving "all music." Perhaps, if, like religion, we stopped inflicting our musical tastes on others ("Mannnnn that sucks! Why are you buying  that   album!?" "uhh..I..wanted..") we'd all be one happy family? Or maybe we really are so finely tuned in on one genre that to challenge this would create societal breakdown...meldrama aside, you get my drift.   After all, how often do you see someone at a rock gig wearing a sweatband and bling bling? It's not just the music we're getting when we buy an album, it's a whole society, the key to a world only the elite can go.  ---  As Luciano Pavarotti once said.." You don't need any brains to listen to music "  And hey, it's probably better that way. If we stopped overanalyzing music, maybe we'd enjoy the music for it's strengths and not the connotations it has.

       All good things must come to an end...   Hey all, and thanks for the comments.  This shall probably be my final entry for some time now, so you'll have to excuse me if it turns out to be quite longwinded; I have a lot of things to say.  I feel like I want to look back and see if I can wrap up what I've been talking about here; I feel like its time to draw some conclusions.  So what have I learnt? I don't know. In reality, I think that this subject is a lot more complicated, indepth and ethereal than I had previously assumed. I had the misconception that there were easy answers out there to why some people are able to find love, and why others aren't, and that I just needed to start asking  the right questions. However, I've found that it turns out that there are no easy answers, in fact, I don't think there are any hard answers either. Maybe there's no answers at all, and all we can do is stick to generalisations, stabs-in-the-dark, and work out what it is that works for us, rather than by designing some foolproof system that can be cut-and-pasted over every life and every heart of every person.       Frankly, I though that I was just missing the tricks, that I wasn't paying attention. I had always had the impression that life moved along behind my back, and ever knew the rules, and the score, and I was condemned to be the water-boy forever. But, so far as writing this blog has taught me, we're all water-boys (or water-girls, or water-persons). There is no such thing as the most perfectly-adjusted individual, completely comfortable in themselves, confident, and able to find (and hold on to love) with the greatest of ease, never ever experiencing the pain of heartbreak; like a master trapeze artist soaring while the rest of us fall flat on our faces from a great height.  But it instead though, I don't know, maybe it's depressing, but I think it's a little exciting and empowering to know that we're all in the same boat here. Sure, some people are better at it than others (and I am definitely one of the others) but that doesn't mean they have any better idea of what the hell is going on than the rest of us do. Don't you think that's sort of a good thing? I mean, it's not like there are winners and losers, it's more like we're all going around discovering stuff that works, getting hurt, and fumbling our way through love together.       In fact, even though I'm still completely dateless (for those of you who've just tuned in, I've never had a girlfriend), I still enjoy the silly games that people play with each other. Sure it can be frustrating, and sometimes a bit depressing, but I wouldn't give up the thrill of the chase for anything. There's nothing more exhilirating than the rush of adrenalin you get when you finally summon up the courage to talk to the girl you've had your eye for so long, and that great feeling as your legs begin to take you closer without you even thinking about it.  And even if it doesn't come to anything, who cares? If she has a boyfriend, or if she turns out to be the complete opposite of what you expected, you still have the rush don't you? Sure, it's not much when you think about what you might have experienced had things worked out, but still; what would you have had if you just sat there all night nursing a drink instead of getting up and talking to her? Nothing but stupid, silly, pining over a girl and guilt. Trust me, that aspect of love I'm an expert on.  So I guess that's the best thing that I'll take from this. It's the realisation that while you need to know the rules, the codes, the tactics of the game; these will all come to nothing if you don't get out and actually  play the game . You have to get out there, learn, get hurt if you actually want to experience the upside to life, love and all the rest.  Finally, I'll apologise for the generally cliche-driven, introverted drivel that I have written throughout this blog; please forgive me, I know not what I do.  PS, hope you like the pictures I've put up, and the new colour scheme.  Actually, one last final word before I go; how come nobody has realised that the title for my blog is actually a pun (or a play on words)? When I came up with it, I thought it was really obvious. Think about it.  Buh-bye.  Please go home.

       It's Turkey Time!       THE PLOT  We meet Larry Gigli (it rhymes with really...) played by Ben Affleck: a "tough talking" gangster. His mobster boss asks Gigli to kidnap the younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor, to save him from going to jail. (Eh…Right.) The brother has "certain physiological defects" and is in mental hospital. But Gigli just walks in there, picks him up and walks straight out again. (Wow.) Back at his apartment, Ricky (Jennifer Lopez) knocks on the door...She has been hired to oversee the operation, as Gigli's boss doesn't trust him to do the job properly. Gigli is a little offended about this:  "If you want to talk about reputations and it by some fxxxing miracle long shot you haven't heard of my reputation, let me tell you who the fxxx I am. I am the fxxxing Satan of Slick, Sadie. I am the Rule of fxxxing Cool. You wanna be a gangster? You wanna be a thug? You sit at my fxxxing feet. Gather the pearls that emanate forth from me. Because I'm the fxxxing original, straight-first-foremost-pimp-mack fxxxing hustler, original gangster's gangster!"  Pheeeew. And that's just the beginning. The film's dialogue is so long and unnatural, and it made me feel more and more embarrassed. Not too mention when they start talking about why Ricky is a lesbian. They are discussing the pros and cons of female and male anatomy while she is doing yoga on the floor!! It's NOT very sexy at all. And then...they fall in love. But wasn't she a lesbian? Not after a night with Gigli of course. The most embarrassing scene of all is when Jennifer spreads her legs and goes: "Gobble, Gobble- it's turkey time!" Watch it, and cringe!    Why did you agree to do this movie Jen?    I did it cause you were in it...Oh shut up! I don't want to marry you anyway!

       The king of B films   "Things haven't been going great lately. For a while now people haven't really been getting my movies. Certainly the box office hasn't been up to speed. Sure, some of my recent stuff hasn't been perfect, but neither has it been the shit that many have said. Critically, it's all become a bit of a crapshoot. The critics thought I was a bum when I started out and they think I'm a bum now."  Said John Carpenter, the maker of a number of Bad Films such as Big trouble in Little China, Ghosts on Mars from 2001: "You don't stand a ghost of a chance" and The Fog from 1980: "What you can't see won't hurt you...it'll kill you!" All recommended!

       Beware of Chinatown!     Big Trouble In Little China from 1986 is so bad that it is funny. It's directed by John Carpenter, who must be mad! It features Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall (Samantha from Sex in the City. I bet she's proud of tis one...) a 2000 year old Chinese transvestite, a flying one eyed blob, a hairy monster and a lot of really crap martial arts fight scenes. Kurt Russell's wears his west tucked into his jeans, which are pulled up almost to his armpits, a mullet haircut and boots that can shoot knifes. He is the coolest guy in town. "No horse shit" Jack Burton.   THE PLOT  We are in San Francisco, where Jack the all American macho truck driver goes to the airport with his Chinese buddy, Wang, to pick up his fiancee coming from China. He meets a mysterious female lawyer he fancies while the girlfriend is kidnapped by a China town street gang "The Lords of Death"(!) They are dressed in the ultimate 80's "thug" gear: Headbands, Michael Jackson style leather jackets and enormous sunglasses. In trying to rescue her, Jack and Wang come into all sorts of trouble (as you do...) It turns out the fiancee is captured by Lo Pan, a 2000 year old evil magician who rules an empire of spirits beneath San Fran's Chinatown. He can only return to a mortal life if he marries a girl with green eyes.(It has taken him 2000 years to find that apparently). Gracie the lawyer also has green eyes, and is captured as well, Lo Pan decides to marry them both after all those lonely years...    The guys get help from an old Chinese man named Egg (!) and make their way through the sewer underground to the Wing Kong Exchange where Lo Pan has started the wedding ceremony. They have to get through 3 guys with supernatural powers wearing lampshades on their heads and shooting electricity out of their fingers, the Room of the Upside-Down Hell and a whole lot of black magic monsters. And what happens in the end? The bad guy dies, Jack and Gracie fall in love, Chinatown is once again a safe place...and Jack hits the road again.   WHO WROTE THIS DIALOGUE?  Jack complains about the loss of his truck, Wang says: "How do you think I feel Jack? I lost the whole girl!" Toasting a drink that will give them supernatural powers in the rescue: Wang: "Here's to the army and navy, and the battle's they have won, here's to America's colours, the colours that never run." Jack: "May the wings of liberty never loose a feather." Egg while explaining some "Chinese history": "Anybody who showed up was going to join Lim Lee in the Hell of Being Cut to Pieces. Jack: "Hell of what?" Egg: "Chinese have a lot of hells."

      the price us girls pay for perfection: Hunger!!   Situation one : "Damn im hungry" yells your stomach, as it churns and rumbles, but your mind screams, "No, you'll regret it when your ass won't fit into your new sass and bides, don't do it".   Why is it that our bodies suffer for a pair of jeans? well considering they are a $200 pair then that seems ok. so really the price of perfection in this case is $200 + GST + HUNGER....."thanks for shopping with us here at "I STARVE FOR FASHION", enjoy your day!!   Situation two:  PORK? BEEF? or SIRLOIN with that side salad mam?   "just the salad thanks, oh, and NO dressing,ta."  Please admit that you have resorted to both these situations in hope of loosing weight. As lame as that sounds, i must admit that i sure have. But i've come to the conclusion that no matter how many diets i tackle, or as many hours i exercise, my own body just can't be manipulated to what i consider the 'perfect' form because, drum roll please.... IT DOESN'T EXIST!! but why?.... cliche time again: beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. the number of times i've seen my friends parade around in next to nothing, or nothing at all, and thought, "wow", is unaccountable for. ive had to listen to them say how much they dislike their bodies, when from my perspective, through my eyes, they are amazing. And if you were to recieve a compliment, your reaction would be, "are you blind?" its strange how easily we are blinded by fashion, the media's perception of the ideal perfect form, yet more significantly by our own insecurities of how we look! is this a reflection of women, in general, feeling as if they need to gain beauty to secure a man, to satisify his desire for beauty? or is it within each of us girls to naturally question who we are?  ok im going to stop now, im getting hell spiritual and deep, too much for my likeing! rhetoric this rhetoric that........
