       Greetings from the Bay Area!    San Francisco is amazing, and if it weren't for the crazy distance from our family/friends in the Great Lakes area, I think we'd be moving here ASAP!  The Ritz Carlton is spoiling us rotton, right down to the turndown service we were welcomed with after our evening out.  I couldn't help but giggle like a schoolgirl and take pictures to show you all when we get back.  Here's a sampling... our 2-sink extravagant bathroom complete w/ separate toilet room (with phone) and the luxurious gym & pool area are my personal favorites.. (the ladies' locker room looks like a fancy parlor in a mansion!!)    We've yet to hop on the cable cars but we've walked the steep hills, browsed through Macy's & ate a fabulous dinner at The Cheesecake Factory.  We also caught a movie (we still can't stay away from the theater!) at the Sony Metreon, which is 4 stories high!  Tomorrow we plan to have breakfast at the 5 Star Terrace here at the Ritz, visit the SFMoMA (museum of modern art), and check out Chinatown (which is 1/2 a block from our hotel) before trading the Ritz for the Archbishop's Mansion til Thursday!  We're looking forward to biking around Golden Gate Park once we're there :)  Btw-- We know many of you suggested against it, but we decided to bring Mark's laptop amongst the other 5 bags of luggage we've been struggling with...  (And I'm contemplating a trip to "The Container Store" for a suitable box in which we can send extranious stuff back to A2)!  We made a rule, however, that both of us need to agree to "laptop time" for it to occur... and even then it's pretty much only use for 3 things.   1) For clearing the 10 million spam from my email account... Sadly I receive about 150 msgs a day and if I let them pile up I don't think UMHS would be too pleased with me! 2)  To make sure Mark's workplace isn't freaking out in his absence (and he's pretty good at saying "oh that's not important" and ignoring them unless it's imperitive to throw them a bone...) 3)  Last, but not least, so we can put occasional updates on here and let you all know we're happy & safe on our fabulous honeymoon!  We love you all very much, but aside from the 2 calls we made to our parents (to let them know our plane didn't crash), our voices will be unheard by y'all until June 10th when we land in Detroit!  More to come...  Love, Mrs. Andrea Marie Heimonen (!! :)

       Well, Andrea and I flew out of the Detroit Airport this morning, and are staying at the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco tonight.  Andrea's currently taking a nap, so I thought I'd take a minute to add a new entry.  The wedding experience was amazing.  The entire weekend was perfect.  Andrea and I drove up to Manistee already on Wednesday afternoon.  We were able to take care of the majority of the decorations on Thursday, so we could enjoy the rest of the weekend.  On Friday, we had a rehersal dinner at 440 West, which was great.  Later on that evening, us guys headed over to Striketown for a few games of bowling.  On Saturday morning, we had a team best ball match at the Manistee National golfcourse.  The course was great.  I teamed up with TJ and Luukas, and we ended up shooting a +9.  My dad, Pentti, Michael, and Clinton shot a +4, while Vesa, Chris, Kai and Daryl shot a +2.  I hear Michael played some great golf, and Vesa hit a beautiful 290 yard drive with the rented driver he was using.  I really enjoyed the best ball format, since I was able to relax, and actually hit a few good shots.  My dad recently bought me a new driver, and I hit a couple really long shots with it.  I hope to get out a few more times this year, and will hopefully be able to revive my game.  The ceremony was perfect.  Andrea had spent a lot of time giving pastor Lashbrook input on the vows and content of the ceremony.  I will always remember the moment the doors opened, and Andrea began walking down the aisle.  She looked amazingly beautiful in her wedding dress.  The reception was at Stronach Hall.  Again, everything was perfect.  I really appreciate all the effort every put in helping make the evening as perfect as it was.  Andrea spent months preparing for the event, and I really appreciate all the little things she did to make everyone feel welcome.  Some of the memorable ideas included:  -A kids table with gift bags to keep them occupied -Out of town guest bags -reserved seating, using movie themes -A hockey shootout for bride/groom kissing, adding a bit of Canadian culture  We stayed the night at the Manistee Inn, and had a brunch/gift opening back at the hall.  I really enjoyed getting a chance to see everyboy during the weekend.  It isn't often you get to see all your close friends and relatives at one time, and that was very special.  We drove down to the Detroit airport and stayed the night at the Weston.  The hotel was very nice.  Andrea wants to purchase the Weston bed, and a duel-shower head attachment like they had at the hotel.  We flew out of Detroit this morning, and are now in San Francisco, as I mentioned above.  This afternoon, we plan on beginning our honeymoon adventure in California.  I'd really like to thank everybody for helping out and taking part in our wedding, and for making it such a special day.  -Mark

       Hi There,  Welcome to Andrea and Mark's Blog.  Andrea and I will be getting married on May 29th, 2004 in Manistee, MI.  The upcoming week will be very busy for us, as we are wrapping up last minute preparations.  Adam and Miranda came over last night to help us out.  Tomorrow, Steve, Jean, and Naomi will be here to help us out some more.  Andrea and I are both a little stressed right now, being concerned that we will have time to get everything done.  Right now, I'm working making CDs to give out at the rehersal, while watching the Simpson's and creating this Blog.  Anyways, we're really excited about the upcoming week.  We leave for Manistee on Wednesday afternoon.  Look for both me and Andrea to continue to update this blog over the upcoming week.

       Hey all!  We've settled back into the daily grind in Ann Arbor, and yesterday we celebrated our 1 Month Anniversary - *yayy!!* :)  Thanks to all of you who've been emailing, sending pictures, calling on the phone, etc...  I think I'm finally ready to get started on the thank-you cards!   Mark and I had such an amazing time on our honeymoon.  I think the favorite for both of us was going white-water rafting on the Merced River (outside Yosemite National Park).  Even though the water was low and we only got to experience clas 3+ rapids, it was a blast!  We ended up covering about 11 miles, and we got to "surf" with our boat, which involved us paddling like crazy upstream and catching a rapid that made the back end of the raft fly up and spit us back out.  Hard to explain, but we did it twice, and none of the other groups would try it!  (I guess you have a huge chance of flipping, though we didn't tip over either time!)  We also went *gasp* skydiving!!  That was an amazing experience, though I don't think we'll become avid jumpers or anything.  It was cool to see the view from that high.. but it was almost unreal.  Which is probably why Mark's fear of heights didn't come into play much.. When you're up that high, the ground looks fake, and you can hardly fathom that you're actually propelling yourself toward it at 120 miles per hour.  Except that it feels like a 120 mph fan is blowing against your face and your cheeks look like a stunt Jim Carrey does in The Mask...  Plus, the harness gives you nasty bruises, so I'm not lining up to repeat that experience any time soon!  That said, it was amazing, and I'm glad we got to do it... We got an 8 minute DVD and a roll of 35mm film to capture the memory, and we'd love to share it! :)  Other highlights of the honeymoon...  An evening ferry trip to Alcatraz w/ an audio tour... Mark got some footage inside the cell walls, and I saw a creepy time capsule cemented into the ground a bit away from the prison.  It had some guy's name on it w/ the year (1926?) and "Do not open until 2026" carved under it.  But none of the tour guides mentioned this.. I wonder if they'll open it up?  We also took a ferry to Vallejo and went to 6 Flags, where we got to watch a Dolphin show and a bird show, both were awesome!  The roller coasters don't compare to Cedar Point's though..  Another fun thing was horseback riding in Yosemite, and taking a visit to see the Giant Sequoia trees.  They're huge!!  By the time we got to Half Moon Bay for our last night, we were both exhausted and ready to come home.  It was nice to be pampered by the Ritz once again before returning to Michigan, and the view of the ocean was amazing!  We got upgraded from a golf course view to an ocean view since it was our honeymoon, but that was pretty much the only perk we got for being newlyweds on our entire trip!  Mark did some filming out our window... and we think we spotted the local for a certain scene in American Wedding where the cake gets an unsightly makeover...  Well, that's all for now, folks!  We miss you all and hope to see you/talk to you soon!  Love, Mr. & Mrs. Mark Heimonen

       Hello, I'm Mark Heimonen, and this is my first blogger post.  I'm a 26 year old Systems Analyst, living in Ann Arbor, MI.  I'm getting married in less than a week (May 29th), which I am pretty excited about.  For the next few weeks, I will probably be posting about my wedding and honeymoon experiences.  My fiance, Andrea, will be travelling to San Francisco and Yosemite National Park for our honeymoon.  We also plan on skydiving while in the Bay Area.  Everyone we talk to about tells us we will have a great time in San Francisco.  If I were to describe myself, I would say that I'm about 50% geek, 30% jock, and 20% musician.  I currently work primary with Microsoft technology (ASP.NET, Sql Server, c#, and VB.NET), although I plan on expanding my expertise in open source technologies over the upcoming years.  My home computer is set up to Dual boot between Windows 2000 and Red Hat 9.0.  I hope to get a second box set up at home, so I can have a permanent linux box up and running.  I want to eventually learn more about Java, Oracle, Perl, PHP, MySql.  I'd really like to get my c#/asp.net running on a linux box with Mono.  In my spare time, I spend a lot of time reading up on Slashdot.  On the sports front, I am primarily a hockey fan.  I'm a huge fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and was really hoping to see them make the finals this year.  The Leafs have had a great strecth of seasons under Pat Quinn the past six years, but have been unable to make it past the conference finals.  Tampa Bay and Calgary have been playing great during the playoffs, and I'm looking forward to catching a few games before my wedding, as I'm forbidden to watch hockey during the honeymoon:)    When I find some free time, I am also working on a music project.  I've written 6 songs over the past year, using virtual synths and a sequencer on my computer.  All I have right now is an old Roland keyboard, an acoustic guitar, and a Radio Shack Microphone, so I'd like to eventually upgrade that portion of my recording studio.

       The ideals of Capitalism and the Free Market have long been ingrained in all of us, but the end results we have witnessed are far from ideal.  It is true that of all the sociopolitical systems devised by mankind, the combination of democracy and the Free Market have resulted in the most productive and fair results; however there are many flaws in the system that prevent us from becoming a truly fair society.   The Free Market system was designed at a time before the technological advancements of our society have changed the entire fabric of our society.  First, I would like to outline some of the flaws in our current society that would not be present in a truly fair society:  #1.  Shrinking Middle Class– The gap between the rich and the poor in our nation continues to widen, and the vast majority of wealth is controlled by a disproportionately small segment of our society.  In 1992, the middle fifth of all households accounted for 15.8% of the nation’s income.  The same segment had fallen to 14.8% by 2002.  During the same period, the wealthiest fifth of all households saw their share of the nation’s income rise from 46.9% to 49.7%.  (USA Today, 07/23/2004)  The top 20% of the nation’s population controls almost half of the nation’s wealth.  If left unchecked, this trend will continue, and a small percentage of the nation’s population will control almost all wealth in our nation, while the vast majority of the country will struggle with day-to-day living.  Can the work of one person truly be worth  urlLink $43 Billion Dollars  ($43,000,000,000.00)?  Compare that to the average American salary in 2002 of  urlLink $36,764 .  If you assume the average worker will work for 35 years, Bill Gates could pay the lifetime salaries of 33,417 people with his current accumulation of wealth.  How can this be considered equitable?  According to Bloomberg, CEOs in the United States are paid an average of $12 Million dollars per year.    We are increasingly facing the risk of developing into a 2-class society.  The rich class, consisting of CEOs and stockholders, and those that are financially well off, continue to develop an increasingly large stake in the control of our nation.    #2. Increasing control by Corporations - When capitalism was first designed, it was implemented as a means to an ends—to motivate each individual of society to act in a way that would be productive to society as a whole.  The mantra of the American Dream could be summed up as “Find a need in society, and fill it”.  We need to recognize that the motivational factors decided upon during the birth of capitalism no longer apply.  I don’t believe this age of multinational corporations, fueled by government tax breaks and exploitation of third world countries, could ever have been imagined.  Corporations continue to ask American workers to work longer hours for smaller pay, all in a bid to help the companies increase their profit margins, and stay competitive in the world economy.  According to a recent article on NPR, working hours in the United States have increased by 20% in the last thirty years, while declining by the same amount in Germany.  Now feeling increased pressure in the new world economy, companies in Germany have begun asking workers to work longer hours, and give up other perks as well, including 5 minute breaks every hour.  The Germans had it right in the first place, yet they are forced to follow the lead of US Corporations.  This will only result in increased profits for the corporations, while stretching the average worker to work longer and longer hours.  Can you not see that corporations are now controlling and exploiting the world?  In every other socio-political system in mankind’s history, the root cause of failure was that a small percentage of the society was in control of the major decisions affecting day-to-day life.  The combination of democracy and the free market was designed to have checks and balances that prevented this from happening.  In this age of corporate tax cuts, government financing, global exploitation, large-scale corporate mergers and layoffs, deregulation, and campaign contributions, we no longer have those checks and balances in place.  CEOs and corporations have become the elite class of our society, able to pay of the United States government and exploit the workforce without breaking stride.  It has becoming increasingly improbable that the average person in the United States can become a successful entrepreneur.  If we continue to accept the status-quo, upward mobility will one day become a virtual impossibility.  Outsourcing/offshoring by American companies is a process that is driving out high paying jobs from this economy, which are replaced by McJobs, all while increasing the profit margins of the corporate America.    #3. Environmental Exploitation/Over-Production- There are no more needs in our society, yet corporations have convinced Americans to continually desire and upgrade the newest, greatest fads, while disposing of perfectly good products that are no longer in style.  We produce more food, housing, and other goods than we need, yet we continue to feel pressure to work hard to keep our jobs, all in the name of profitability.   We have turned into a  urlLink disposable nation , where it is cheaper to buy a new printer or monitor, than it is to have it repaired.  One only needs to watch the recent documentary,  urlLink Super Size Me , to recognize that we have become an over-indulgent nation.  We continue to consume vast quantities of our natural resources, with literal regard for environmental concerns.  Here is but a small sample of the issues we face:  -Ozone Layer Depletion -Greenhouse Effect -Deforestation -Over-harvesting of fish -Overflowing landfill sites -Toxic waste dumping -nuclear waste sites -Over-consumption of non-renewable resources  In the capitalist system, there are no checks in place to ensure that corporations function in an environmentally responsible manner.  Each individual and company is motivated to keep up with the mechanisms of the giant profit-driven corporate machine.  The United States is currently waging war, all in the name of keeping prices of gas and oil as low as possible (Even as they refuse to publicly say so)  The fact is, the Bush campaign has lied through their teeth, and have failed to come up with a single plausible explanation for the war.  One multinational company, Halliburton, is going to profit more from the Iraqi war than any other.  This company, formerly headed by vice president Dick Cheney, was  urlLink awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in no-bid contracts by the United States government .  In 1999-2000,  urlLink Halliburton gave $709,320  in political contributions, of which 95% went to the Republicans.  At the same time, Halliburton’s Subsidiary, kellog Brown and Root (KBR), is under now under scrutiny for illegally operating in Iran, and wasting tremendous amounts of money.  Corporate America is in bed with the United States government, and for these reasons, the government cannot be relied upon to hold these companies accountable.    #4.  Failure to Provide Quality of Life for all – Despite the fact that our nation is rapidly depleting the natural resources of the world, and producing more than our country is able to consume, we have failed to provide for a large percentage of the United States population.  According to  urlLink US Census data from 2002 , there were 43.6 million uninsured people in the United States.  At 15.2% of the entire population of the United States, this represents a large portion of the country that will either have difficultly paying for their health care costs, or will not be able to receive the medical attention they require.  To help you put this into perspective, a recent feature on  urlLink NPR , this amounts to the entire combined population of the following 24 States:  Oklahoma, Connecticut, Iowa, Mississippi, Kansas, Arkansas, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, West Virginia, Nebraska, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Montana, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming.      There are an estimated 700,000 homeless people per night, or 2 million per year in the United States.  31 million Americans now live in hunger, or on the edge of  urlLink hunger .     What can we do?  The first step is awareness of the issues involved.  We must learn not to accept the status-quo.  In a future blog, I will explore some of the ideas I have for change, along with other interesting ideas that I have discovered.  There are many other sociopolitical issues that I plan on exploring in future blogs.  These issues include the state of health care; ideas for improving democracy using technology; technocracy; software patenting; along with offshoring and outsourcing in the software industry.

       The current political climate in the United States angers me. What angers me is the almost complete lack of public outrage to the Iraq war, given the lack of justifiable reasoning for said conflict.  I'll start by stating that I recommend that every person in the United States owes it to themselves to watch Fahrenheit 9/11. The day the movie came out, the Bush administration was administering spin control, claiming the movie was a pack of lies (Without even having watched the movie!) Before condemning the movie, I recommend  A) Watching the movie, B) Taking a look at  urlLink Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 Notes/Sources  C) Forming your own opinion on the subject  The truth is that the American Media is very corporate/right wing oriented, which makes it hard to have a balanced view on the issues. While you're at it, I recommend taking a look a couple other documentaries:  A)  urlLink Control Room : A documentary on perception of the United state's war with Iraq, with an emphasis on Al Jazeera coverage - This title should help you get another perspective on the impact of the War.     B) Out-Foxed: I have yet to actually see this film, although I have ordered it. This documentary provides some insight into the government's influence on reporting  by the Fox News Network.  urlLink Lawrence Lessig  has some  urlLink material  on this film.  The  urlLink New York Times  also has an article on the film:   You can order the film from the following website:  urlLink http://www.outfoxed.org/ , or from amazon.com.  (In fact, since being released last week, Out-Foxed is the #1 seller on DVD at Amazon.com)   c) UNCOVERED - The Truth about the Iraq War - A summary about the deception of the Bush Administration used to justify the Iraq War.  This documentary includes a video montage, showing clips of Bush and Powell attempting to back up the intelligence stating that Iraq has Weapons of Mass Destruction.  It is almost pathetic watching the certainty on their faces disappear over time.  The penultimate moment comes when Bush is asked: (Paraphrasing) "Do you think the United State's credibility is on the line concerning the finding of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq?"  Bush stutters for a few moments and then states "I, uh, have no idea what you mean..."   D) The Fog of War - A documentary by Robert McNamara about his career as Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War and the Cold War.  This documentary helps you to understand the futility of the war.    Getting back to my original point, I would like to re-state that I am angry at the current political climate of the United States.  Where is the public outrage? Why are the opinion polls showing Bush/Kerry in an almost dead-heat, given the complete lack of evidence to support the current War on Iraq?  What were the original reasons given to justify the War on Iraq?  #1. Iraq has Weapons of Mass Destruction?      Bush has now himself conceded that they will probably never find evidence of WMDs. The senate intelligence committee has now found that the pre-war intelligence that the Bush Administration claimed to have simply failed to exist. This sentiment is now echoed by the Butler report findings in Britain. Before the war began, there was speculation that the administration did not want to reveal the information contained in the intelligence reports, because it would compromise the security of human intelligence assets within Iraq. The reports now reveal that the administration actually had poorly trained intelligence teams, which collected unreliable information, and a shortage of agents within Iraq. Where is the outrage?        #2. Saddam and Iraq have ties with Al Qaeda - There is  urlLink no credible evidence  linking Saddam Hussein with the Al Qaeda terrorists of 9/11.  IN FACT, a much better case can be made for claiming ties between the Osama Bin Laden and the president himself. These ties can be documented as follows:      -President Bush served in the Texas Air National Guard with James R. Bath.The two were suspended together for failing to take a medical exam.  Later, the Whitehouse attempted to hide this connection when releasing a public document, however the Michael Moore already had the original. -James R. Bath later financed President Bush's first company, Arbusto Oil.  James R. Bath became a money manager for the Saudi Bin Laden group, owned by the Bin Ladens, who one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia -The Saudi Bin Laden Group invested heavily in several Texas companies, and is heavily linked to the Carlyle Group, President Bush Sr., James Baker, etc. -The Bush Administration has tried to downplay/marginalize/spin this link by stating that Osama was the black sheep of the family, and has no ties with the rest of the family.  This may or may not be true, but it is pretty astonishing that the Bin Ladens were escorted out of the country without even being held for questioning immediately after the national airspace was re-opened.  The fact that the nation of Saudi Arabian Royal Family has trillions of dollars invested in the United States economy makes it very difficult or the US Government to act impartially when dealing with these people.   The fact is, is that is much easier to link the Bush Administration directly to Al Qaeda than it is to link Saddam Hussein to the Al Qaeda.  If the Bush Administration had this type of evidence to demonstrate a link, it would be all over the news.  The Senate Intelligence Committee once again refuted this claim, stating that there is no credible evidence that could be used to state this claim.      The United States AND The World are now a safer place - Now that evidence has come out to show that the War on Iraq was waged on false pretences, the Bush Administration has started to once again administer spin control, stating that the War on Iraq was justified by stating "The United States is now a Safer Place".  This fact was hammered home by the fact that George W. Bush repeated this phrase 8 times during a recent 32 minute speech in Oakridge, Tennessee.  The fact is: AMERICA IS NOT A SAFER PLACE!  Iraq has now become a breeding ground for anti-American sentiment.  I watched some of the images from The Control Room, and saw hatred in the faces of young children growing up in Iraq.  Iraq has now become a failed state, and we have created a new generation of children that will grow up hating the United States.  What evidence is there that the United States is now a safer place?  In fact, Tom Ridge recently stated that there is evidence that a wide scale terrorist attack will be made in the United States, with the intent of disrupting the democratic process.  How is the United States a safer place?          The State Department issued a "Patterns of Global Terrorism" report in April, and tried to point to lower terrorism numbers, stating that Global Terrorism had declined to a 34-year low in 2003, stating that the Bush Administration's efforts were working.  Later on, it was found that the report was severely flawed, missing hundreds of terrorist attacks.  In fact, when a revised report was released, the number of casualties due to terrorism shot up to 625, which was more than twice as high as the report initially showed, marking 2003 as having one of the highest levels of terrorism ever reported. (Audio Report,  urlLink NPR .  The fact remains that the Bush Administration has failed to provide credible justification for the war on Iraq.  Every justification they have used has turned out to be a lie.  The only valid assumption that can be made is that this is a war of greed.  Several large corporations in the United States, most notably, Halliburton, stand to make a  urlLink mighty profit  from the war (Search Google News: Halliburton Iraq contract).  The Bush Administration claims to stand for strong moral values; however their actions have failed to live up to their words.  The soldiers fighting this war, the people of Iraq, and the public, in general, all deserve a proper explanation.  To Summarize:  The Bush Administration deceived the United States Public and the Senate by using flawed intelligence and deception to wage an unjust war on the people of Iraq.  After the Senate Intelligence Report came out condemning the war, the Bush Administration was given the chance to state that they had made a mistake.  Instead, they have continued to state that the War on Iraq was just.  The hubris demonstrated by Bush Administration has gone unchecked for far too long.  I find it amazing that, given the overwhelming evidence of deception demonstrated by the Bush Administration, that the results of the 2004 election are still in question.  Where is the public outrage?  How can the United States public still support this administration?  Why are the current polls showing the race to be dead heat?

       A majority of voters currently do not agree with the Bush Administration’s handling of the situation in Iraq.  The Bush Administration's failure to provide a straight answer on why we went to war has disenfranchised many voters.  If the election were based on only this issue, the democrats would win in a landslide; however, the issue is clouded.  Instead of focusing on foreign policy, and whether or not the War on Iraq was just, we also need to consider: the budget and economy, jobs, health care, education, national security, crime, civil rights, social security, abortion, and a myriad of other issues.  From this giant myriad of issues, we're supposed to decide which of two sides more closely matches our beliefs, and cast one single vote every four years.  At that point you better hope that you didn't leave a hanging chad, and you better hope that you didn't cast your vote on a Diebold machine, and you better hope you didn't commit a misdemeanor before voting in the State of Florida.    I'd like to refer back to my previous blog, entitled  urlLink Capitolism, Exploitation, and Over-Consumption .  In that blog, I raised several key areas where our current sociopolitical structure is failing us.  These areas include:     Shrinking Middle Class   Increasing Control by Corporations   Environmental Exploitation/Over-Production   Failure to Provide Quality of Life for all    In order to address these issues, it is obvious that we are going to need to make some changes.  We need to develop a system that results in greater accountability for corporate and government actions.  The current system of political campaign contributions needs to come to an end.  For a perfect example of the corruption that can occur, here is a quote from my previous blog:  "One multinational company, Halliburton, is going to profit more from the Iraqi war than any other. This company, formerly headed by vice president Dick Cheney, was awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in no-bid contracts by the United States government. In 1999-2000, Halliburton gave $709,320 in political contributions, of which 95% went to the Republicans. At the same time, Halliburton’s Subsidiary, Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR), is under now under scrutiny for illegally operating in Iran, and wasting tremendous amounts of money. Corporate America is in bed with the United States government, and for these reasons, the government cannot be relied upon to hold these companies accountable."  Short Term Goals  Democracy as it is currently implemented in the United States is somewhat anachronistic.  During the original elections, when word-of-mouth was the primary means of communication, it was an amazing feat to gather votes from every citizen once every four years.  The times have changed, and the advent of the internet has provided the possibility to give every citizen of the United States a chance to have their voice heard.    Recommendation  I believe we should create a website which allows citizens of the United States to inform themselves, and to speak out and vote on each bill as it passes through the house or senate.  For the rest of this blog, I will refer to this website as the "Internet Voting Initiative".  First, I will discuss the features this website should provide.  Secondly, I will attempt to address some of the technical aspects, security and other concerns of the Internet Voting Initiative.   Features   There are three key features I envision:     A research section, which contains detailed information about key issues, along with detailed proceedings of the house in senate    A public forum which provides an area for blogs and discussion of bills and key issues    A voting area, which allows each citizen of the country the ability to cast a vote on each bill as it is processed.      Research  - There is a vast amount of research available on the internet.  For instance,  urlLink Thomas  provides  urlLink detailed information  on house and senate proceedings, and the ability to  urlLink search for bills  based on a wide variety of criteria.  Other websites, like  urlLink Project Vote Smart  and  urlLink FirstGov.Gov  also aim to educate the American Public.  I am simply recommending that we provide these services in a single, easy-to-use website, designed by a publicly-appointed committee.     Public Forum  - I believe this to be the key feature of opening up the democratic process, which is to provide a public forum for discussion of each bill and issue facing our country.  As you are reading this article from my blog, I am sure you are aware of the impact blogging has already had on our democratic process.  Howard Dean was able to generate plenty of political momentum through blogging.  They even  urlLink invited and granted media credentials  to some of the nation's top bloggers at this years National Democratic Convention in Boston.    First off, I think the website should provide "Blog This" button on every page of information contained in the website.  At the end of the website content on each page, a list of the blogs created for that page should be listed.  The August 2004 issue of  urlLink wired  had an article entitled "Why Oprah Will Never Talk to You. Ever".  The general thesis of the article as that as the volume of blogs produced continues to grow, the single-to-noise ratio becomes so low, that only a small percentage of all blogs ever get read.  According to the article, the most popular blog is  urlLink Slashdot , which ranks fifth among all news sites, when ranked by number of inbound links.    I would consider Slashdot to be more of a message board than blogging site, but that brings me to my next point.  If the Internet Voting Initiative is to provide blogging links throughout the website, there needs to be someway to increase the single-to-noise ratio of comments provided, so that the general public can swiftly weed through the junk and read the posts which are most likely to properly address the issues at hand.  For this purpose, I recommend using the tried-and-true method of the "Slashdot Democratic Moderation Scheme".    For those of you unfamiliar with  urlLink Slashdot , it is a community forum that discusses issues dealing with the technical sector of our society.  The tagline of Slashdot is "News for Nerds, Stuff that Matters".  If you are unfamiliar with the Slashdot Moderation Scheme, I recommend reading,  urlLink This brief Introduction , the  urlLink Slashdot Guide to Moderation , and the  urlLink Slashdot FAQ on Comments and Moderation .  The basic gist is this:  as comments are added to a discussion, other community Slashdot members can choose to moderate your comments up our down, if they feel the comment is either under, or over-rated.  Each comment has rating of -1 to 5.  Individual users can set their preferences, based on the quantity and quality of comments they wish to view.  For those users who have limited time and only wish to see the highest quality comments, they can set their threshold at 5.  I generally browse at -1, meaning I can see a full, unedited version of conversation.    There are many other nuances to the moderation system.  Users also have karma, which is a general indicator of user's potential to positively contribute to the community.  If a user consistently provides asinine comments which are modded to -1, they will have a bad karma, which will negatively affect the initial rating of each comment added by the user.  I will leave the discussion of other issues, such as metamoderation, and the accumulation of mod points to links I provided above.  In addition to the ability to create full blogs, I also recommend providing a general message board area for each issue on the Internet Voting Initiative.  Both areas would be moderated by the "Slashdot-Style Democratic Moderation Scheme".    Voting Area  -  I believe that, one day, we could use such a system to allow the general public to officially vote on every bill as it passes through the house and senate.  For now, I propose a much less radical idea:  Allow the general public to use this interface to vote on each issue, but only on an advisory basis.  Such a vote would have an immediate impact -- The general public and media would easily see if the general public was in favor of or against each bill that was voted on by the house and senate.  If the government often voted against the opinion of the general public, they would not remain popular for very long.  I believe such a system could go a long way toward achieving accountability in government and corporation interaction.  Technical Aspects, Security, and Other Concerns   Security and Accountability   The chief concern of the general public would be the security and accountability of such a system.  It is imperative that this project be developed as an open-source project.  Since one of the key goals of this project is to increase government and corporation accountability, complete transparency in the development process of the project is necessary.  One  urlLink doesn't need to look far  to see that closed-source applications cannot be trusted.    I would recommend that an open source development committee be appointed to oversee the development of this project.  The complete source code for the project should be made publicly available.  Many open source developers would be very interested in making sure that such a publicly visible open source project would be free of any major security holes.  This project could go a long way in establishing the legitimacy of the open source movement, which has been criticized as of late.       Authentication   Authentication may well prove to be the most difficult issue to deal with.  In order for the voting process to function correctly, the Internet Voting Initiative would require each citizen of the United States to be granted a single unique set of login credentials.  Perhaps the government would be able to use Social Security Numbers, but that still poses the question of how to provide password information to each user.  I don't believe giving the password information over the phone, or by mail, is a good idea.  Perhaps allowing each user to create their login information when they actually go in to vote would be a good idea.  Alternative forms of authentication, such as smart cards or biometrics are not feasible in the short term future, since they would require a significant rollout of the new technologies.      Replication   A website hosting a key government function, such as the Internet Voting Initiative, could one day be the victim of a cyberterrorism, or a physical terrorist attack.  As such, it is important that the project be set up as a multi-node, distributed application, with database replication.  It may even be a good idea to get several universities involved in hosting the application.   Architecture   Personally, I have spent the vast majority of the past four years working with Microsoft technology (ASP.NET, C#, and Microsoft SQL Server), so I would be hard-pressed to make good decisions on the architectural implementation of this project.  In general, I am a proponent of highly organized code and object-oriented development.  As the application would also need to be highly scalable, I would lean toward recommending a combination of J2EE and Oracle, hosted on a Linux server.  I know that vendor lock-in would not be desired, but perhaps Sun and Oracle would freely support such a benevolent project, based on the positive publicity they would receive.        Accessibility to General Public   One of the key issues to implementing this project would be to convince the government that we would see wide-scale acceptance and usage.  It will take a long time for the general public to become familiar with concepts such as blogging, metamoderation and flamebait.  The Internet Voting Initiative would see fierce adoption by the political blogging community, and, most likely, the Slashdot community as well.  It is true, that, in the beginning, the results of such online voting and commentary would be skewed towards technically inclined.  According to  urlLink this BBC News Report , half of all American households now have Internet Access.  The internet is becoming more and more essential to everyday life, and by the time this project was ready to be deployed, the vast majority of households will have an internet connection.           Computer hardware and networking equipment is cheaper than ever.  Publicly accessible computers are available in libraries throughout the United States, and it would not take a great deal of expense to provide dummy Linux terminals with limited access for free public use in more public places. I do not believe public accessibility to internet accessible computers will be a major within another two or three years.  How do we proceed?  The Internet Voting Initiative is a feasible project that could effectively be used to provide greater accountability between the United States government and the nation's citizens.  The biggest hurdle I can foresee is convincing the government of the need for such an initiative, along with showing that there is support for project among the general public.
