      Have you ever tried watching TV with a women?  I find it more painfull than dental work.  We have sevety some odd channels of horseshit on.  Of those channels I like about a half dozen, my wife likes two or three.  Tonight, but some mishap, she actually ended up with the remote.  I thought about killing myself after five minutes of her channel surfing.  She passed up a show on bees another on formula one racing and another on WWII.  The straw was Patton.  Can you believe she didn't want to watch Patton?  If you have never seen Patton, your life is deficent.  What did we end up watching?  Some chick flick with Jennifer Anistink and a bunch of gay characters.  The plot line was that Jennifer Anistink was SO hot she actually had the main gay guy batting for the other team by the end.  What a pile of dung.  If I was gay I'd be pissed.  Do you honesty think a person is gay just because they have nothing better to do?  All it takes is nice set of tits to change their mind.  Please how fucking ignorant.  Oh well, if was watching Patton right now I wouldn't be regaling you with my tale of women and TV.  I decided to drink a few beers tonight instead of trying to get laid.  The beer out of the fridge is warmer.

      I have decided that I will use this thing to bitch.  I will feel better and my wife will feel better because she won't have to listen to me.  Not that she does actually listen, more like hears, maybe not even that.  I am like the perverbial (sp?  I need to get a blog with a fucking spell check, what kind of cheap ass site doesn't even have fucking spell check?) tree in the forest.  I have known my wife for ten years and she has no fucking clue who I am or what I want.  She is mean to me or makes mean comments about my family (disclaimer, my family is odd).  I get laid about once every lunar cycle.  I get complements about once every blue moon and I get a break about once every trip around the sun.  Fuck!  I try to be nice and act like a cival person.  I didn't have a single beer today at a family picnic.  Primarily because I'd be the only one drinking (what a bunch of fucking bores) but also because I thought my wife would be impressed and maybe I catch a break.  Instead her family decides to stay for fucking ever.  Did I bitch about it?  Hell no.  What's the point?  My wife's mom has made it clear any time my wife feels like leaving me her mom would take her in in a second.  No "work it out with him", no "did you ever consider that he drinks because he never gets laid"? "Nope, it's fuck the goyum, the cheap bastard!"  Ah I feel so warm.  I honesty believe that my mother-in-law would not be too torn up if I were to die.  She'd be content with my wife and my daughter.  I hope to Christ my daughter doesn't end up a fucking bitch like my wife and her mom.  I would be devastated to know that my daughter was going to ruin another man's life.  I think I'd actually cry.  I think I'm starting to understand this blogging crap.  I feel better already.  I want to curse and scream and beat the shite (deliberate mispelling for my Irish friend) out of someone.  At the end of the day I wonder if I am fucking crazy.  Either I should leave this women before she breaks me completly or maybe it's just not that bad and I like to complain like a women.  I mean seriously have you ever heard a women in Gen X bitch?  It is like they think the world is owed to them and that blow jobs are for birthday candles.  I can't stand nearly every women I meet that's my age because they complain all the time (Yes I see the irony in the fact that I am complaining about complaining.  Do you WANT to see me in the clock tower?)  Whaaaa, I don't make enough money!  Whaaaa, my husband only wants to fuck me. Whaaaa, my husband drinks too much.  Whaaa, I'm too old to have kids. Whaaa, Whaaa, Whaaa!  Fuck!  Oh well the bitch left me alone for five minutes.  I guess it's back into the ring.  Maybe I'll go have a beer first.  Dull the pain.

      Today I had a meeting with my business partners.  Increasingly I find these meetings frustrating.  I feel like we leave these meetings without enough completed.  It is a big deal for me to leave my family for the entire day.  The time away must be productive.  I’m not sure it was.  It was a re-hashing of things we had covered before.  I suppose I’m just being impatient.  The time for action is near and I want to close the door on some of these projects we’ve been working on.  Perhaps I’m just getting a little arrogant, thinking I can go it alone.  I’m sure we’re all feeling a little tired of the talking and just want to get done to it.  When my wife got home tonight my daughter was in the funniest mood.  She was dancing and hugging.  It is so great to see her this way.  She had been sick for the past week and we upset most of the time.  My wife was smiling too.  I guess at the end of the day it’s all good.

      Today I had my wisdom teeth removed.  I am 34.  I am old to have them pulled out they say.  It was just time to get it done.  I hope to be able to get braces.  You know, those invisible ones.  Finally have a nice smile.  I don't feel too bad and my wife has been kind to me today.  She has been a real nurse.  Got me food and medicine.  I am thankful for her help.  Through all of this the highlight of my day is the fact that my daughter is feeling better.  Last week we started her two days a week at day care.  I'd like to call it pre-school but we would just be lying to ourselves.  While there she came down with some sort of hybrid stomach like flu thingy.  She started with diarrhea that left her bum very sore. (A word to parents, they make this stuff called triple paste ointment that really does the trick on a sore bottom.)  Then she got a runny nose.  By the time she woke up this morning she had barely slept and was crying almost non-stop.  I took a shower with her to see if it would help.  When I turned her back to the water she fell asleep on my shoulder.  When I got out we put her down and she slept for two hours.  She awoke as a new baby.  It made my day to see her doing better.  The sun rises and sets on that little girl.  All in all, a good day.

      Had another fight with the wife.  I can not understand why we fght.  I do love her.  Yet she drives me crazy.  Ever since our daughter was born she has been short tempered and nasty.  She doesn't see it.  She doesn't realize how mean spirited she can become.  It's hard to try to get inside her head and see what she needs and why she needs it.  It seems we are beyond love.  We are into some weird new teritory where only the answers to deeply spiritual or personal questions will do.  I can not answer them for her.  I can only hope that in some way I can ease her journey, maybe be a better husband and friend.  Maybe...
