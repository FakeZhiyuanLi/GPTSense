      His name was Jullian Ripple.  I am now 27.  I was 16.  We both worked in a pizza shop in a small town outside of Philadelpia.  When you're sixteen, you're told that life is to be sweet.  Sweet enough for most to make this assumption at least.  I was blonde, athletic, and intelligent.  He was a man, something I had little experience with - though there had been many boys whom I'd played with in one way or another.  In hindsight, I should have known he was a bear of man.  In fact, should have known he was dog.  There was an abundance of flirting, but I always saw it as something innocent.  A man looking at a girl, as I had seen many a man look at a child without the ability to touch.  We became friends, in a co-worker kind of way.  He wanted to touch me, but I just wanted to flirt with the unknown.  We drank coronas in his dump of an efficiency, listening to music and letting the time pass between cigarettes.  I held my innocence close, not realizing that in itself was a temptation.  I wanted independence from life and to experience an adult friendship where someone could apprciate my soul, though it was still in its own infancy.  He kissed me one night while drinking those coronas and smoking my sticks of death.  I attempted to pretend I was a woman with breasts and a heart not-yet-touched.  My clothes started to come off involuntarily.  There was no end to his game, but it felt like the end of me.  A cherry blossom popped at the stroke of 2 AM and I felt my life unravel.  Everything went silent, thought there were murmers of his moning and my shaking voice telling him to stop.    "I'm a virgin," I would say over his breath so many times that it fell into the rythem of his deep, delving stride.  "Stop.  I don't want to do this..."  I wonder if his mid shut off too; he clearly couldn't hear me.  "I don't believe you.  You feel like a woman," he said while pinning me down with one hand over both my wrists held above my head.    Once he had finished, he kissed me as he pulled out of the bloodly hole.  "I guess you were right".  He smeared the crimson across my leg.  "I thought you were lying.  Let me walk you home."  There was nothing to say or do.  I had brought this all upon myself.  I had wasted the one thing I held dear, thinking that it was something purely physical.    The assult of my hymen yielded much more than a physiological change.  I was a woman, and never to be a vestal virgin protecting my once sacred fire.  This all happened eleven years ago today; the ides of August: the day I should have known better.

      I'm turning 27 in about 12 hours and I wonder how all this time has flown by.  I imagine the countless years filled with drinking, smoking, fucking and more ebbs and flow filled with both paridy and poison.  With this still-mid-twenties holiday approaching, I took the liberty to review my sometimes unothodox behavior.  I've dated a narsistic all-american-soon-to-be doctor, an alcoholic with an intensely, ironic adonis-like physique, and a slew of other equally disturbubing though uninteresting characters.  With the tragedy of each dance, I wonder why I've let these relationships fuel or extinguish my own passion for happiness.  It seems to be exactly what I've cautioned others to be wary of in their own lives.
