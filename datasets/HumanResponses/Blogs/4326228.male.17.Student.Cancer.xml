       first Ill start by posting the meaning of " Independent "       Not governed by a foreign power; self-governing.     Free from the influence, guidance, or control of another or others; self-reliant:  an independent mind.      Not determined or influenced by someone or something else; not contingent:  a decision independent of the outcome of the study.      often  Independent  Affiliated with or loyal to no one political party or organization.     Not dependent on or affiliated with a larger or controlling entity:  an independent food store; an independent film.        Not relying on others for support, care, or funds; self-supporting.     Providing or being sufficient income to enable one to live without working:  a person of independent means.           O how I want to and dream of being completly independent, by my self, on my own no one eles to support me! That would be the greatest thing in the world right now to live by my self and feed my self and hook my self up with all the toys I want becuase I am in a very well state of independance. That would be so tight and I look forward to it :) Anyways to take this a step farther as I do with every thing eles in my mind.  When people are dependant on something that gives that thing power to be used any way it pleases. I'm not saying magical power but when you are dependant on something and it is takin away, you are hurt. Depending on the level of dependance tells how much of a loss it will be. For example and Ill keep it simple, forks are no longer being made, we are dependant on the fork making companies or what ever to get the supplies and supply the stores with the forks that is then sold to the customers of the store. Owell its just forks, Not a big loss.  Now we run out of air to breath,  we all die.  Big loss  More about this fork thing, So we buy from the fork companies so we are dependant on them for forks. what are the fork companies dependant on? They are dependant on the metal to be made for the forks and with out the metal, We the customers dont get any more forks. Prices go up until no one is buying them any more or the metal is just simply gone. Therefor the metal company goes out of buisness, the fork companies go out of buisness and we the people are there with out our forks. Who wins here? The people do, the people were not making any money off this and forks were never too needed, hell we can use a fucking stick if we have too. (chop sticks) we have other resourses to be dependant on.  Now take this same story but say the fork company cant sell any forks becuase every one is using sticks now. Who wins here? Well the people were not envolved in this crash at all becuase we are busy using our sticks. No metal or forks envolved so we are in the clear. The metal company just says fuck it and goes back to making cars and airplanes. who the hell uses forks anyways? and the fork company goes bankrupt and starts a whole new thing like selling chop sticks.  What I'm trying to get at is there is ways to mold this whole            independent  and     dependent   thing and if you take a good look around you it is being used and abussed all over the world. To a point to where if we are dependant on something enough we may even go to war over it. A big example but I'm not saying we are only in war over this is Oil. just SAY this whole war is over oil. Iraq cut us off cuase we pissed them off and we were clearly dependant on them for oil. Who loses here? This one is not so hard to tell that we the people here in america are no longer getting oil. [Yeah thats too bad, we lose]    Now that I stated what the independant thing was all about, now to learn how to use it to your advantage or relize a step before someone eles takes advatage over you and screws you over. Sometime in your life you are bound to lose something your are dependant on whether its big or small doesnt matter your still missing out on something. The first step to preventing this is simply knowing what conditions your in and what conditions your sources of dependancy are in. You may simply lose a dependant source becuase it runs out just like the metal in my first story. Knowing that the metal is running low ahead of time will give you time to break off from being dependant on it. Knowing that there is a war about to break out between the fork company and the metal company ahead of time is also good, becuase most likly the metal company will cut the fork company off and we are stuck using chop sticks becuase the fork companies no longer have metal to work with. Stay ahead of the game, keep on your toes and always knowing what is next is one of the key parts. Knowing whats around the corner to come will give you an idea of what is needed to be done.  I will admit that using the whole fork and metal thing was a little random but I used them for a point. The point that is needed to be known if you ever plan to use the    independent  and     dependent thing   to your advantage. My point being that knowing how it all works out you can then use it on ANYTHING! Yep every body is dependant on something and that makes us weak. But every one is weak so if you know how to use the weak, that makes you stronger. Ill now give a example of when I used this theory to my profit all the time. Yes it may be lame but its better then the whole fork idea and its true.  I used to run a team and as the leader I made the choices. My team and I got good enough to where sponserships and new members were being tossed around left and right. I managed to get over 300$ worth of servers and shit for free! and now that I think of it, it was 300$ a month and it lasted for a good year. All I had to do was play a danm game too. WRONG there was so much more to it then that. I did not get all that stuff for free off of one choice and sponsership. I had to make the right choices going back and forth from better to worse to obtain these sponserships. As I said before, stay ahead of the game and know whats around the corner. I knew what was up and when I made choices that may have seem really fucking stupid at first, ended with over 3600$ in free shit and thats only including part of the things I had.  What were these choices I made? Well one of the choices that may have seemed not so great at the time was completly getting rid of a sponsershi[ that was hooking me up with a free vent server. Why did I do this? Becuase I knew of a new company that was going to come out, I knew how big they would become becuase I knew what their resources were. I droped my little sponser becuase being sponserd by some little thing is shit compared to being sponserd by nuclearfallout. Plus to be honest it made us look bad. Anyways enough with the whole gaming thing, I droped my team and got rid of all my sponserships becuase I was always working on things for hours at a time which was no fun. But as I stated before You have to be on top of things. It got so bad I can remember talking with an old g/f and having to stop becuase I had to talk with sponsers and see what they wanted me to do for them. They had the power to take away my sponsership and I did not want to lose it. I was dependant of them Anyways so yeah, would have to stop talking with a girl friend of mine just to go work on server settings or practice or see how they want me to advertise for them. So I said fuck it and quit the whole thing not to long ago becuase I was tired of doing all this shit for no money in my pocket. It was quite some work...  Now that I droped the thing, I found out just how dependant this company was of my team. Infact I said i would keep doing it for money but they said no anything but money. They even offered to pay for more servers... They lost one of their best teams and we helped make them look better so more poeple looked up to us and seen we were using nuclearfallout for servers and that if we are using it, they must be good. Thats the whole reason anyone would sponser you in the first place pretty much is advertisment and knowing this is just another way You can use the independant thing to your advantage.  Knowing about being indpendant and dependant is really helpful in life. It has helped me be a great leader for many things besides just gaming and maybe it will even help me in the future if I just find way to use and abuse it. (Ill be filthy ritch someday)  I typed this up just as it came to mind, took me a while but I typed it really fast. If things dont make sense, I dont care. I got what was on my mind on "paper" so I'm happy. Plus earlyer I had another one of thoes danm reality checks. I need to put my mind through more work. "Good things are bound to come" as I think she said. lol  My "homework" is done and now to listen to some Seatbelts  (Cowboy Bebop's theme song maker,  its jazz music)

       Danm I'm bored as hell just sitting here I MUST GO OUT WITH FRIENDS!!! Hmm anyways, Just played some step mania with Downey.  ( I swear he is asian cause he can play DDR like a mofo)  I was listening to the songs and sense I am a man who enjoys all sorts of music even if it is  corny and lame I may like it.  But dont get me wrong, about 80% of the songs on DDR suck.    But I just got down listening to this one song that like blew my mind away.  It was like why the hell am I not at a rave right now?  Which makes me think,  That would be so fucking cool if the school put on a rave with good lights and good dance music.  Not the whole bump and gring to the gangsta/hiphop beats which is cool but more of the Crazy liquid dancing  music.  I would say, " Why dont they play both?" but I know the answer to that, its a very strong change and every one would just be like "WTF Mate?" It would throw every ones grove off.  I have not gone to alot of dances but the ones I went to were pretty sad excpet one at chs I went to was pretty cool.  They had like dancing tables where like people would just get on and grind.  It was crazy cool but umm the bad thing was it wasnt just a dance table full of woman, there was men up there too and the table was full and more then likly your touching some man. lol  They werent tables... that would be unsafe but like little stages just in random places by the music.  The school should do like a dance during cluture week or ANYTHING for a reason to throw a rave.  (culture week was pretty random)  They should have kick ass lights, smoke machines and a good live dj!  Someone good like dj teisto or dj doeboy or dj extacy or dj speed... the list goes on and on.  If they cant get a dj to spin and mix up some songs for the dance then get a good cd with alot good dance music.  Hmm,  I think I'm just in the mood to dance lol and want to watch alot of poeple liquid dance.  Allthough its a very strange way to dance if you think about it,  Its like one of my fav things to watch.  Every body has their style and its just fun to watch people. This is just a pointless random thought that went through my mind like 10 mins ago.  Anyways I need to think of some things to do in Texas.  Right now I have Paintball,shoot lots of guns,eat and shop.  Thats about it.  My dad wants me to come up with more stuff to do.  And can you belive that fool is going to let me drive his car while he is at work any where I want!  BWAHAHA  a car that I can drive all I want in a state away from home with many new things to do and a bunch of money.  I'm bound to get into some kind of trouble.

       I just made my father cry!  it wasnt like I just gave him such a hard time that he broke down in tears.   I was talking to him on ventrillo and we were going over what we should do when I come down to vist him for the first time In my life.  Well then he brought up something from germany when I was two.  The strange thing is i remember some things from germany even though I was only two and I told him about my memories.  I remembered the house and how it was shaped and I remember our nieghbors and how they would always pinch my cheeks to hard.  Then he brought up something about skating in front of the house and It poped into my mind what went on with skating in front of the house.  I remembered the color of my skates (blues and yellow) and I remember they shifted in size to adjust to people feet.  I remember how they buckled and I told my dad all of this.  He went silent the second I started to bring up the skates and I just kept going off on memories that I had from when I was two.  and I know they are true becuase he just busted down on vent apologizing to me.  this is actually the first time I never really got to witness any emotion or anything from him even though it was over vent.   I have to admit, no matter how strange it is and it showed he really does feel sorry for doing to me what he did.  This doesnt change shit, I'm not any more mad or any more happy about this.  It was just another one of thoes reality checks I get all the fucking time letting me know whats up. The only thing that sort of hurts is knowing I can remember all that stuff,  It makes me miss it and I want to go back and see what it was like but I never will be able to remember it all.  I'm going to call Bj, see if he wants to skate.

        Hrmm this song was pretty danm fun to sing with friends  "No Rain" All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watchin' the puddles gather rain  And all I can do is just pour some tea for two and speak my point of view But it's not sane, It's not sane  I just want someone to say to me oh,oh, oh, oh I'll always be there when you wake Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made  And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I start to complain that there's no rain  And all I can do is read a book to stay awake And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape escape......escape......escape......  All I can say is that my life is pretty plain ya don't like my point of view ya think I'm insane Its not sane......it's not sane.  I just want someone to say to me oh, oh, oh I'll always be there when you wake Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made  (I'll have it made I'll have it made You know we're really gonna, really gonna have it made Gonna have it made ahhh,ahhh, ahhh, ahhh)   The lyrics are a little strange but fun to sing when your with your friends having a good time. which brings me to what this post is going to focus on. "The Pretty Kitties" A LONG time ago like seriously 8 years ago I had a group of like 3 friends. And we were going off on how gangs were silly so we came up with this fake gang called the "pretty kitties". Anyways here is a list of some of the more commonly known members.  Tim,Mike,Matt,Tara,Teresa and I.  Thoes were like the main members but as years go by things have changed. I no longer hang out with a few of them as much as in the past and there are plenty of new "Pretty kitty" members now. Infact there are alot of members now, so being that gang is well established and every thing is going fine and every one is "equal" in status. Well as I listed before there are 2 people up there in the list that are still top members of the gang. Mike and Tim.  Mike and Tim have been my friends for many years and we decided to establish another part of the gang. A more underground secret part that is most of the time up to no good as long as it benefits them selfs. I wont go into detail excpet when the triforce is at its best, your probably getting screwed. ( I just read what i put down and it sounds so stupid AHAHA but All i can say is good times)    Mike: Very cool guy, he is him self and no one can change him. He has been the same crazy guy that I have known from the first day I met him. Just by how he dresses and how he acts. Been friends with him for about a long time. He is for sure one of my best friends all though he is a scandalis scandanavian. We have had a lot of good times together and there is still alot more to come. Later days  Tim: where to start with Tim? Tim man If you ever read this, much love. We have been through so much shit together and I mean hard core shit. somethings poeple will never know about we went through and we are still alive and doing well. We have been through so much problems with each other but we have always been in it together. You have litteraly been my best friend longer then any one. I cant stress enough how much diffrent my life would be and would have been with out you, who knows it could have been better or worse but to be honest. I have had so much fucking fun I would not trade it for money. (Unless it was like a million$ becuase then we could party for a long time :) The thing is, I know you would say the same about me. We feed off each other for better or worse and its tight that way. I litteraly look to you as a brother.   Luke: Luke O man, Danm you are tight. As all my other friends you are your own person and do your own thing, dont care about poeple around you really as in what they think about you. If your having fun, its all good. Known you for quite a while. FUCK something just came up so I guess you only get this.  Got to go hook up some speakers and subs for Jeff, he is a noob.

        Here I am posting again....  Anyways just got back from registration and now talking with Andrew downey on vent.  We have alot of classes together which is tight as hell becuase he is smart and cool.  2 of the classes are computer classes and we are like gaming buddies so it all works out great!  My Schedule is easy as fuck!!! but i have to talk about this health 2 class.  I have my health 2 credit but not my health credit and health is a sophomore class I belive so I wonder if they just put me in health 2 again for the hell of it.  What ever nothing to big.  I have a idea of how the school year is going to be, pretty much like last year except maybe a little more drama.  While I was standing in line for registration this girl came up to me (no names) and asked if I could hook her up with some herb.  BWAHAHA just like last year...  I  talked with only a few selected people that I wanted to and pretty much ignored every one eles. just like last year.  So this bong rip is for the school year.   Good luck to all and I better fucking graduate.  Oyeah and I got to trade my id card with this one girl.  She has a pretty ugly one of me and this one is still bad infact its really funny. But at least I'm not so danm ugly and scary in this one.  Just look really funny.  (God I hate pictures, people look better  in the real world, not on a piece of "paper")  I'm going to go, Downey and I are allready ploting stuffs for the school year belive it or not...  P.S. I did not get my licence today!  FUCk registration took to long then I had a doctors meeting so now I have to wait another week.  on the way back from the doctors I got to watch a cat get hit by a truck, My mother cried and I must say it is pretty sad but I'm going to take this as a reality check. I'M ALIVE!

       "Here's your Cancer horoscope for Tuesday, August 24th, provided by Astrology.com:  You're in an especially festive mood, and ready to play. Try not to be as excessive as you'd like to be, though. This mood will last for a few more days. Mete it out carefully." So wrong...  I feel like shit, got hardly any sleep last night and to top it off I walked strait into my door when I went to go take a shower to wake up.  The shower was great as all showers are  but now I have to go pick up my licence  and then register at school.  Arg I know both things require a picture but right now I'm not in the mood at all to fucking look nice.  In fact when I'm done with all this stuff Maybe Ill just come home and sleep for ever.  Or untill I find something more worth my time.  My mother and I were talking again about school.   Some things she said to me, " Your starting to grow alot, your looking like a true man or some shit like that"  Yes mom very flattering and all but it was great how you pulled the join some military branch bullshit on me, it will be better for your life.  FUCK I KNOW THE MILITARY WOULD HELP ME OUT ALOT BUT FUCK THE MILILTARY!   I mean FUCK!!!  I have uncles who cry and scream in their sleep becuase of shit that went on in the war.  Pretty bad when like all the men in my family have killed someone.  BWAHAHAH.  Well excpet for my uncle bobby but he was a drug dealer so it doesnt matter.   I'm not saying I would get put in war, front line and have to kill someone for sure if I joined the military its the reasons we go to war.   I would sure as hell shoot back if some country came into united states and was trying to kill every one.  But I don't plan on going somewhere eles to do it, I'm to lazy I guess. Plus I dont like having to be yelled at non-stop to keep me in line.  It would drive me to the point where I would have to kill some of  "my own people" to get the fuck out of there.    I could type about this for a while, what eles is on my mind.  OYEAH! my sister,  hrmm well lets just say if things keep up the way things are going with her she will have a hard time working at a gas station and from staying homeless.  She is going to be going to CV this year with me so maybe I can umm sort of guide her but Ill have to show a good example and I hate going to class as well.  My mother wants me to go to registration with her tomorrow, Help her through all that shit and I said I would.  Infact I want to help her cause seroiusly,  she has no life at the rate she is going unless she becomes a slut for some really old guy with lots of money.   Well I'm off  to go school, wonder who I will see today.

            ok It is now 3 in the morning and I'm tired but my bed has to much clothes on it that I never put up so Ill have to atleast shift them from the bed to the couch.  I'm going to talk about someones brother now.  No names mentioned but if you know who this person is and more then likly you don't. You would know who I'm talking about.  This person is a very unique person by far.  Yes he is a little slow  but something about this guy just stands out and I really like him.  He is his own self and just by talking to him for a quick second you can learn so much about him by his facial expresions and the tone in his voice.  When watching a skit on mad tv that had a shit load of blood in it, it actually grossed him out that he had to leave the room and this was a skit done by mad tv!  He stood up and left the room and it shocked me.  It really showed his character,  He is such a nice guy and he is so nice it is one of the points where if anything bad happend to him I would feel bad.  Kind of reminds me of this one girl I knew who had 100$ stolen from her but anyways back to my little story. This kid is sort of anti social only going out to do martial arts or thats what I have seen of him.  When he is doing martial arts he is in his own world and its tight as hell if you can zone out on something like this to where the people around you don't matter at all one bit.  He is doing his own thing and nothing matters to him excpet whats at hand.  I wish people were like this more all the time with life, didnt care one fucking bit what other people thought but yet still had the morals and respect to treat others as humans.  (If that makes any sense)  that would fix so many problems in this world if people just did their own fucking thing.  Owell,  what I'm trying to say is allthough I'm not saying this to your face and doubt I ever will,  your still a good friend of mine even though we only do little talks and never hang out together.  You need some help with anything and Ill help you.   hrmm... my first real journal entry and it just made me relize how nice of a guy I am. LOL

      As of right now I don't have  much on my mind except who am I going to want to see this and why the hell I'm even doing this.  Ill just post random stuff that pops into my mind at the moment, and I'm sure I will be able to put more "intresting" post up later.  Anywho, about this danm blog.  I was told by someones mother I should start to keep a journal becuase I have a very odd way of thinking.  Which brings me to my next little thing,  If people are going to be looking at this I can not and will not post any names if there is ANY chance of offending anyone.  I will not post incriminating things that I do not feel people should know about and to be honest,  This is allready seeming like a shitty idea to start a blog.  The reason I am not doing this on paper is becuase I simply cannot write that fast and keep it readable.  I'm guessing my blog is going to have the word "Shrooms^" Around somewhere so just to explain that a bit...  I'm a nerd and Shrooms^ is the name I have been using for quite a while now for gaming online so I just sort of stuck with it.  Infact there is alot of history behind that name and it even goes back to having over 300$ worth of servers and stuff for free. "Good times" and infact I'm talking with some friends from school on ventrilo right now. (Just part of the free things I get for being so good at gaming :)  Oyes and the URL to this blog is like bigglassofwater or something like that.  Yeah umm... I picked that out at random, I had a huge cup of tea and that was like the only thing that came to my head so Ill more then likly change it later.  I'm done talking about my blog, Ill fix any problems with it later.   Its now 2:30 in the morning and I have to go to the DMV tomorrow and pick up my licence then go to CV and register for school.  That will be my day unless I go to a friends house  which I probably will.   I'm going to end this post here and see what my blog looks like and how I should fix it.  If I had a laptop that would be so tight, then I could do my blog thing from anywhere.  P.S. Ill make my font and stuffs more eye pleasing later.
