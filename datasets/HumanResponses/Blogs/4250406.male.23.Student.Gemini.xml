      Well, I go back to  urlLink college  once again and for the final time. I must say, I'm not a hard worker at all and that has given me and those around me quite a bit of grief in the last few years. I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the lines of highschool I realized that there's only so much I'd be able to learn in school. I guess I was right, because I can almost pinpoint the moments in which my brain just shut down and said, "Well, we had a good run; I'll see ya around buddy." I would just like to point out that this wasn't due to drugs nor alcohol. I'm sure some of you Psych majors are saying to yourself, "That's what happens... if you keep saying it to yourself, you'll start to believe it and it will come true." Well, it did, and I'm pretty much a failure at college. I'm prepared for the next stage in my life: a career. The worst part is, I am pretty sure that I will not be doing anything in my career with regards to my major (Electrical Engineering). I really don't enjoy it all that much and I'd much rather be fixing, upgrading and troubleshooting common computer problems all day for some Penetrode company out in Anytown, USA. Let's hope Cat becomes rich and famous with her artwork so I can be a stay-at-home dad.  I would be a kickass stay-at-home dad.   So anyway, where was I? Oh, nowhere. Well, OK then. This year will be my final year, regardless of me graduating or not (BUT I BETTER FUCKING GRADUATE). I'm taking some upper lever engineering courses, as well as some stuff I've taken before to try and up my GPA. I'm amazed the school still allows me to go there.  I love the Olympics. I really do. We've been watching 5.5 hours of it daily and it's still not enough. There's only about another week left, which is good because I don't want it to be on while school is in session.  urlLink NBC  is doing a fantastic job, methinks, and I've been doing a pretty good job avoiding  urlLink radio  and  urlLink Yahoo!  throughout the day so nothing gets ruined for me when I watch at night.  I gotta start packing shit up today and I'll be doing that the rest of the weekend. I'm gonna try and go see  urlLink Garden State  tonight with  urlLink Cat  and maybe some others (if I can get a hold of them).  I  love   key lime  and  lemon merengue  pie.

      Look at me, I have a  blog . To be quite honest, I don't know how often I'll do this, but when I do...  WATCH YOUR BACK, JACK . Speaking from a geek point of view, I do enjoy the fact that this whole place seems to be XHTML compliant, right down to the  bold  tags using CSS. But I digress. I really only started this blog to read my buddy  urlLink Paul 's blog and comment on it. I don't remember if I was required to register, but I did anyway and here I am.  Where to begin? Well, let's start with what you already know. I'm a dude, I have a girl of nearly 6 years now. She's usually my better half and seems to tolerate me just enough, which is good. What else... ah yes, well I'm the youngest of 5 children (1 sister, 3 brothers) and I don't have much to say about that. I also have a cat (Bart) and a pair o' lovebirds (Rocky &amp; Adrian). I go to school (still... yes... don't ask, please) at the University at Buffalo (yes, I said AT) and I seem to be majoring in Electrical Engineering.  So anyway, most of the time I'll say (physically) what I think, which makes a blog not so interesting to read. I guess I can do some ranting on here from time to time and see how it goes. My guess is, only a few people will actually read this crap.  Here is my blog for what I'm currently doing:  Well, I'm sitting here, typing. Cat is at her final exam for Art History 390. I'll go pick her up and if we're hungry, we'll head out to Edison Diner to celebrate, then maybe watch 21 Grams afterwards. My days this summer have been as follows: Wake up, work, bullshit, eat, tv/movie, sleep, repeat. I've made some money this summer, but it will be all gone again soon because it's me we're talking about. Going back to school via Budget truck a week from today. Hopefully the apartmentmates will be cool.  Ok, I'm bored now. Time to go watch the Olympics and work on  urlLink www.moorecat.com .
