      I wish I was a cloud They're free to fly through time and space Going whereever the wind takes them Trapped, though, wherever the wind takes them Perhaps I do not wish to be a cloud  I wish I was a cloud Blending in with the atmosphere Surrounded by all those who feel the same Lost, though, are individuallity and self Perhaps I do not wish to be a cloud  I wish I was a cloud When tired and heavy with too much inside Pouring it out and sharing it with the world Only, though, to be filled again to the breaking point Perhaps I do not wish to be a cloud  I wish I was a cloud Taking life as it comes Seeing all there is to see Never, though, experiencing life Perhaps I do not wish to be a cloud

      Alone, I climb Up molehills of life Daring, caring Making them mountains I climb alone  Alone, I roll Down hills of life Laying, playing Enjoying the pain I roll alone  Alone, I wander Through desserts of life Questing, jesting With my mirrage I wander alone  Alone, I drown In waters of life Teeming, streaming All with the flow I drown alone  Alone, I am Throughout this life Living, giving All of my self I am alone

      I am your rock just a bit weathered You won't see my crumbling within  Stop worrying about me You don't need more on your shoulders while you're standing on mine  It was only one tear and I put it back Turn away, I'm okay Well, I will be  Okay, pick me up carry my burden But only beacause you need me with you  Okay, put me down but don't let me go You need me, you need me I know you do

      Each day I live I feel the ache Something is missing I'm hollow inside  Each day I give Give way to the ache Cover it so no one Sees the real me  Each day I act I forget that I'm fake I go through the motions That make me look sane  Each day I know I make the mistake I conform my thoughts To be just like you  Each day I sigh How much more can I take? Crowded isolation No one understands  Each day I cry It makes my heart break No one can express Just how they feel   Each day I bet Kepp raising the stake Trusting even more Of my soul to be seen  Each day I sing For my own sake Expressing my soul, Emotions, me  Each day I pray For those who don't make Each moment count Life is too short

      She is so sweet Her kind-hearted spirit Surrounded by shyness Yet full of spunk Flowingly emotional Honest Moral Religious and true  She is so vibrant Her cheerful air Glinted by wild side Deep Dark Yet fun Bright Cheery With the Melting smile  She is so mixed Her hearty attitude Ready for challenge Yet vulnerable to pain Crazy Cool Strong enough To ask for help  She is so chic Her unique outlook Composed by many Yet all her own Glossy Rosey Displaying love  She is so me Her understanding thoughts Curiously question Yet hold faith A mirrored image of My loyal friends    For Erica, Kathryn, Amanda, Aleks. Thank you for shaping who I am with your beautiful friendship.

      I walk around inside my head Inside my house Dreaming thoughts  I sip pink lemonade Its sour Makes me thirsty For everything  I wash my face I love that To clarify Yes To clarify  I hold myself Smooth legs Rough arms Thinking dreams  I write in darkness Invisible ink Morning reveals Mourning reveals  I pull in the car Not going anywhere Tonight that is Life on hold  I listen for sounds of intelligent life Phone calls mostly Life in waiting
