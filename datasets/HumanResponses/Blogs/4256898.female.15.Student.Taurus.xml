        Todae, Sundae nite.... again mus think of tml... the dae to face the weekdaes again and to face all of those hw and test tt will be given by the teachers... But anyway, todae was quite a good dae compared to those of the others... Todae, i am able to do my hw without my dad's presence and tt i m able to to it peacefully... Though i seem like i always haf a bad tittle in my entries, most of the time when i post it, i m still in quite a good mood, but jus a bit to restless as nth much exciting happened... =) Think tt mayb things if seen more simple, things would oso be more simple... Hope tml will be a gd dae.... =)

Nth much though, even though it is a saturdae... nv go out, nv go and play bball... whole person felt so weak and tired... hope to jus lie in bed and slack for the whole dae...

      Today, it is the day when my effort that i had put into the Prefects' Investiture finally paid off... Even though things went on faster than we had planned... nth went off too much... Today, prefects from other schools like Mayflower Secondary and Ahmad Ibrahim Seondary and more came to gave their support which made me felt very relief even though we had informed them quite during the last minute... I even got to see my previous Prefect Master whom I had adore and idolised since Secondary 1 when I first got into Prefectorial Board. However, he left to become a counsellor after teaching my batch for 1 year... which had made us felt quite sad.... Even though times spent toking and communicating wif him had become veri veri less... but then our relationship is still as close as though he is still our Prefect Master... As my position now as a 2nd Deputy Head Prefect is being comfirmed, it will mean that I will face more work and duties and that i will wanna learn how to cope wif it... Even though there may haf been conflict within all of us... I do not think that I will wanna solve it as the other party had not seem to put in the effort, and that others had hated her/him.... She/He may be in the good books of the teachers... but then she/he will noe that all the tough work had been done by her/his colleagues whereas she/he had been the one whu had been gaining the credit... Truth will one day be out, and the teachers will see wad kind of a person she/he is and that she will one day get her/his punishment for doing all those things that had hurt the feelings of the others... =) ****Happy 15th Birthdae to Bertina Cheong****

Went home so so late and really had a lot of things to do.... but then still tot of entering another entry here.... I will forever remember... * ¶ðügh ¶ïMë§ döñ‘† £ä§¶; ¶ðügh mïñd§ dð -- £ðüï§* This sentence... by £ðüï§ (OBS Best Instructor) to me, make me have the synergy to work... to do my best... I will nv give up and will nv bow to problems unless i am left wif no other choices.... =) Good N!t3...

          Today, the first time I post things into a blog account. Feeling quite weird as this will show what I felt for the whole day. Today, quite a bad day for me though... Woke up late and rushed to school in my dad's car... Although not late for both duties and school... the whole day is still a veri boring day. Nothing went really good and that things tomorrow will still carry on as a big big mystery and i only can say that forever in school... Forever theres' tests... :D Hope that tml will be a better day for all the people in this world....
