      I've added some information on the right.  Starting tomorrow I am going to keep track of my weight and also list some of my goals for this year.  One thing I have noticed over the last week is that George has the most influence over me when I am tired, stressed and bored.  There were some slip ups this week, especially towards the end of the week after some sleepless nights.  I skipped some meals, and then made some poor food choices, mostly out of convenience.  George also used a compeling argument, one I always lose.  He claimes that I should reward myself with food I like because I had a rough day, or did something good.  I have got to stop losing this argument....I have to stop using food as a reward.  It's not even like I'm buying Oreos or bags of chips.  I opt for mexican food from Paco's Tacos across the street, or pizza from CPK instead of the chicken breasts I baked earlier in the week.  I hate myself when I do that, especially because I am paying to see a nutritionist!  I have a food plan I can follow -- I get a lot of food choices on my plan.  I eat 6 meals a day, so it's not like I'm going hungry.  So, why am I eating the wrong food?  Depression?  Boredom?  Stress?  Yes, to all of those.  I guess the next question is what to do?  I did take a step in the right direction -- actually about 3.4 miles of steps.  I did 60 minutes on the treadmill at the gym this morning.  I burned about 650 calories (I tend to focus on calories burned more than distance or time).  It felt really good to sweat.  Don went with me, which always seems to make it easier.  I wish he liked to workout earlier, but not too many people like to hit the gym at 7:00 AM on a Saturday or Sunday!  We do have plans to go again tomorrow, before the Super Bowl.  We have a good eating plan for tomorrow -- veggie platter during the game and bbq'd steaks with a big salad for dinner.  To try and keep myself honest, I will also start putting my food plan on the blog and letting you know how I'm doing.

      I haven’t mentioned this before, I think because I don’t really want to face it, but my mom is going in for an angioplasty tomorrow.  She called me about 2 weeks ago and casually mentioned that she had been in the hospital for 2 days because of a suspected heart attack.  I was taken by surprise because, even at 62, she is an active, healthy woman.  Apparently this is mostly due to hereditary more than anything.  It’s still a slap in the face.  On top of it, the doctors found some major gallstones.  The first step is to fix her blocked artery and then have her gallbladder removed.  I was feeling angry because she didn’t call me right away.  Her excuse was that she didn’t want to worry me until she knew exactly what was wrong.  I can understand that, but it still bugged me she didn’t call right away.  I’m a little stressed about it because I am just not ready to be without my mom – or my dad for that matter.  As I told Don, “I am not ready to grow up!”  Don lost his dad about 10 years ago – 2 years before we met.  His dad died suddenly of a heart attack after finishing a round of golf while having a beer.  I’m not sure what is worse – knowing one of your parents is going to die after a long illness or having it happen without warning.  I know both my parents dealt with sick parents over an extended period of time and it was really draining.  I have a good relationship with both my parents, so I wouldn’t need to make peace or anything, I would just want the chance to tell them I love them one last time.  On top of this, my mom told me about our friend, Nancy.  Nancy is a little younger than my mom, and we met on my first day of nursery school when Nancy’s daughter, Jackie, and I were in the same class.  Jackie and I have remained friends, and our families have been friends ever since.  We used to go to Imperial Beach (near the California/Mexican boarder) every summer.  Nancy was like a second mother to me.  Sadly, their family has been cursed with cancer.  One of Nancy’s sisters died of ovarian cancer when I was in my early teens.  Her other sister has had a radical mastectomy.  Both Nancy and Jackie have had breast cancer.  Jackie lost her second child at 3 weeks to SIDS.  Nancy is still dealing with her cancer – it has spread to her liver and she is moving from chemotherapy to radiation next week.  The outlook isn’t good.  I don’t deal with death well.  I never have.  It’s not like I am afraid of death.  I know that none of us get out of this life alive.  I just am not ready for it to happen to people I love.  I’m not ready for when it does happen to my loved ones too early.    Over the last few years, I’ve had to face it a few times when I wasn’t ready, and when I knew they wouldn’t have been ready.  Shoba, who died in a plane crash; Brian, Jackie’s son, who died of SIDS; Kristi, who died of anorexia and alcoholism at 37; Patricia and 16 other friends who died on 9/11 in the Twin Towers.  Life isn’t fair, my friends.  And neither is death.    You can’t choose when you are going to die, or how.  But you can choose how you are going to live your life.  Live it to the fullest – NOW!

      Even though I knew it was coming, hearing the phone ring at 4:15 AM this morning really made me jump.  Because of the storm, I did have to come into work at 5:30 AM.  Of course, we have had no calls.  As it turns out, only one office is really affected, and the building is closed so we probably won’t get very many calls at all.  The really bummer is that I still have to work until 4:00 PM, mostly because of the client meeting.  If that wasn’t happening, I’d be leaving at 1:30 PM.  I did watch a heart-wrenching documentary on  urlLink HBO   last night called  urlLink Shelter Dogs .  It is filmed at a “no kill” shelter in upstate New York.  It shows people surrendering their dogs, temperament tests, staff meetings, euthanasia (in the case of a sick dog and a dog who cannot be adopted) and adoptions.  I actually had to turn it off twice.  Both my dogs were reacting to the sound of the T.V. and I think it was stressing them out a bit.    Both of my dogs are adopted.  I have very strong feelings about rescuing animals, surrendering pets, spaying & neutering and euthanasia.  Some of the reasons people give for giving up their family pet I can understand (a dog doesn’t get along with other pets).  I can’t understand why anyone would make a commitment to an animal, only to give it up on a whim.  I totally believe in spaying & neutering – unless you are a licensed breeder.  I know some of my co-workers haven’t fixed their pets, one because she wants to breed her Rottie.  No offense, but do you know how many Rottweilers there are in city pounds and non-profit rescue groups?  The last thing they need to do is add 6 or more puppies to the mix.  I know they say they can adopt them all out, but what happens if they can’t?  They’ll end up in a shelter, hoping that someone likes them better than the Rottie in the next kennel.  I just wish people thought about the responsibility of owning a pet before they decide to adopt a cute puppy.  Don and I discussed it for a few years, and knew what our boundaries were – we had to own a home, we wanted two dogs (preferably male & female) – and even though everything didn’t exactly go as planned (Baja was supposed to be fully trained before we got a second dog – ha ha ha), I believe both Don and I know what we have gotten ourselves into.  There have been some challenges, but when Baja and Jager curl up with me, I forget about the new hole in the garden or the nibbled hole in the blanket.  I’m getting off my soapbox now.  If you do have a chance, catch the documentary.  It’s a powerful show.

      Boy, I hate it when work interferes with my personal life.  I was hoping to leave work early tomorrow and have a “date” with my husband.  Don has been working a lot of late shifts – 2:00 PM to 11:00 PM or 3:00 PM to midnight – and he always works at least one weekend day, so I haven’t been able to spend a lot of time with him.  I figured we could meet at the gym, get a quick workout in and catch a 3:00 movie.  Unfortunately, I have a late afternoon client meeting with a really difficult travel manager and her lackey.  There seems to be a lot of internal strife within the company and whenever something goes wrong because of their lack of communication with us, it’s our fault.    I’m also feeling a little out of sorts this week.  At this time last year, my husband was working for the NFL as an editor at  urlLink nfl.com .  It was his third year with the NFL.  It was a wonderful job.  His office was 1 1/2 miles from our house (he could actually walk!), it paid great, he had an awesome boss, and the perks were out of this world.  I was able to go to the 2000 Super Bowl in Tampa Bay, the 2001 Super Bowl in New Orleans and the 2002 Super Bowl in San Diego.  There were some downsides -- he was in the press box for the game, so I sat with some of the other wives.  His days were usually long, especially since he was editing everything that the writers were writing, so we'd eat really late and I didn't actually get to see him a lot.  The airports were always a hassle the day after Super Bowl (such as 1 mile-long check in line at Southwest when we were leaving New Orleans).  Since we got the dogs, we would have to arrange kenneling.  But, overall, it was a great experience.  Plus, we got a lot of swag -- watches, hats, jackets, etc.  In May of 2003, the head NFL office in NYC decided to close the LA office.  There were a lot of politics involved, a lot of lies told, and it wasn't handled very well.  So Don became one of the thousands of people looking for jobs.  He was lucky.  He ended up at  urlLink FoxSports.com , but in a much lesser roll (with less pay as well).  So now for the first time in 3 years, I don't have plans for the big game.  I keep telling myself I really don't want to be in Houston, and it's going to be great to watch the game from home with Don and the dogs, but to be completely honest, I  do  want to be there.  It looks like it's going to be an early morning for me tomorrow.  The east coast is getting hit by a huge storm and when their offices close, offices in the sunny parts of the country take their calls.  I will be getting a call between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM to see if I will be needed in the office.  Oh, joy.  I think for every "snow" day the east coast gets, Los Angeles should get "rain" days.  Let's face it, no one in California knows how to drive in the rain.  Plus, that way there would be fewer cars on the road and that would mean fewer accidents.  I think that's a fine idea.  George hasn't been bugging me too much today, although I am hearing him tell me that we shouldn't have to go to the gym if I have to be up at the crack of dawn.  I'm hoping I will be strong enough and get my rear onto the treadmill for 60 minutes.

      OK, so I am not independently wealthy, and cannot enjoy my mornings sipping lattes while reading the NY Times.  Maybe then I would be a more informed voter.  Instead, I have to deal with late staff members, severe weather affecting our travelers (especially a group returning from a cruise in Miami), burned out team members and innocuous conference calls.  Such is life.  I kept George pretty much in check today.  On my Trader Joe’s run after work, he did convince me to get some vodka for an après work martini.  Hey, vodka is allowed on my food plan, and so are olives.  I even came home and cooked up a slew of skinless, frozen chicken breasts for lunch this week.  I have a wonderful new device from  urlLink Williams Sonoma  that will help me not to overcook my chicken.  I highly recommend it.  I used it on steaks last night and it was wonderful – juicy, cooked to perfection.  The one area that George seems to be taking control is my meeting on Saturday.  My company is having our “holiday” party.  We can’t really call it that, so we are calling it our 2004 Kick Off party.  Between the meeting and dinner, some of the more creative members have been asked to showcase their wares.  We have people who make note cards, glazed dishes, decoupage mirrors & frames, etc.  I will be displaying my candles, soaps and incense.  I will have pillar and container candles.  Many of my staff members have received my homemade soaps and candles, and have said they really like them.  I really think I do a good job – my crafts are well made, smell good and colorful.  The problem is, George (the critical voice in my head) says I am going to lug all these candles down there for nothing.  He tells me, “No one cares.  They won’t buy this junk.”  And you know what?  Maybe they won’t.  But I am still going to take my wares.  I don’t care what George says.

      Today was actually somewhat productive.  I finished the last of my candles for Saturday's staff meeting.  I have some trimming and polishing as well as packaging, but they are mostly done.  I took George for a mile and a half walk.  He really didn't want to go, but it was such a beautiful day.  Don and I took the dogs, and now they will pretty much be floor mats (actually couch pillows) for the rest of the evening.  I've even eaten well.  I am making steaks & veggies for dinner.  My gym bag is packed for tomorrow.  I have my breakfast foods ready for the week and will be baking up a slew of chicken breasts for lunch.    Monday morning is weigh in, and I'd like George to be down to 159 -- only a 1-pound loss -- but a step in the right direction.  Well, off to do the rest of my Sunday chores!

      I read something this week that really got my blood boiling.  In a January 18 op-ed piece for the Los Angeles Times, William Bennett wrote, “Marriage is about many things, but it primarily ties together three purposes: protecting women, domesticating men and raising children.”  He uses this argument for encouraging Republicans to support a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.  Now, maybe I have a different perspective on this subject – I’m from California, I am socially liberal, and, oh yeah, both my parents are gay.    Here’s my take on what is threatening the “institution of marriage.” 1. Infidelity 2. Money problems (jobless recovery, gambling) 3. Dealing with children on drugs 4. Heterosexuals not taking marriage seriously (Bennifer, Brittany Spears)  My father has been with his partner for 14 years.  My mother has not been so lucky in love, but has been with her partner for 18 months.  Would I feel threatened if my dad decided to walk down the aisle?  Would you feel threatened if my mom decided to register at Macy’s?  I fully support a church’s decision not to sanctify a marriage.  I do not, however, agree that we need to politicize something that one cannot change about themselves.  Would the world really go to hell in a hand basket if homosexual unions were to pass?    I know there is the argument about the world becoming more permissive – gratuitous violence and sex on movies screens, lyrics about hate, “celebrities” arrested for rape and child molestation, etc. – is a valid one.  But what is wrong about love?  As long as it’s between two consenting adults, do we really care?  Should we really care?  As the Bohemians said in Moulin Rouge, “The greatest give you will ever have is just to love and be loved in return.”

      I’m sure some of you are wondering exactly how hard is the road ahead – the one to looking good naked.  Well, I am carrying around 160-pound extra person inside of me named George.  I met George about 8 years ago when I was in a car accident that left me with a concussion.  George came into my life and fed me with comfort food and gave me an excuse to sit in front of the T.V.  George talks me out of all kinds of stuff – “Why not be safe and stay inside today?”  “Who in their right mind will ever buy your candles or like your photography?”  Not that he’s been all bad – George has protected me from getting emotionally hurt, or so he says.  Don did break down that wall, much to George’s chagrin.  George loves to drink beer, to smoke and could live on Mexican food.  He can never turn down a Krispy Kreme, much less a slice of pizza.  During his tenure, he has placed a chokehold on my thyroid, my self-esteem and my willpower. He can’t understand why I feel the need to spend 60 minutes on a treadmill – maybe if the gym would put on the Food Network on one of the T.V.s instead of CNN (he figures the gym wants to exercise your mind in addition to your body – phooey!) In some ways, I imagine him as an older brother – one who can’t pass up a chance to belittle me, but who will always be there to protect me when I need it.  Despite all of this, I have decided George must go.  I like fresh fruit and veggies.  I could actually be a vegetarian (my grandfather, who owned his own butcher shop, is turning in his grave, I know.).  Who am I enlisting to help me eliminate George?  Well, Don for one.  He’s on his own weight loss quest.  We both work out at the same gym, at the same time when we can (he works a lot of night shifts, so it’s usually one weekend day).  He’s doing Atkins, so he gets to eat bacon, eggs and cheese – all of George’s favorites.  I also have a nutritionist, Dr.P, who is helping me develop a healthy eating plan.  My physician, Dr. T, who believes George could be removed surgically (gastric bypass), but who is versed in dealing with stubborn thyroids.  My mom, a former high school art teacher (and an awesome artist in her own right), who believes in my artistic capabilities as a photographer.  My dad who, along with my friends, can’t understand why I don’t have confidence in my crafting.  That is my support group.  And, if you continue to come back and read, you will get to know very well.  This may be an uphill battle, but with my wonderful friends and family fighting by my side, I know I will succeed!

      OK, here it goes, my first attempt at blogging.  I've been reading several for some time but never had the balls to try it.  Who cares what I think?  Well, I don't really care what others think, this seems like a fun experiment.  So a little about me.  My name is Shannin and I am a nudist in training.  Seriously, I am on a quest to actually look good naked to someone other than my wonderful husband, Don.  In answer to your question, this is going to be more of a diet/exercise diary rather than some x-rated blog -- sorry to disappoint!  It's going to be a long journey.  Weight has always been my enemy, and now that I am in my mid-30s, my enemy seems to have moved right in and made himself at home.  I'm tired of hearing my doctor threaten me with dire warnings.  Plus, I really do want to feel and look better.  I live in Los Angeles -- I'm actually a 3rd generation Californian -- something virtually unheard of.  I have a house in Westchester, with a white picket fence to boot.  I have two wonderful rescue mutts -- Baja, a 2 1/2 year old golden lab/hound mix & Jager, a 3 1/2 year old brindle staff terrier mix.  They are the loves of my life, and have taught me a lot.  I work in corporate travel -- trust me, it sounds much more glamourous than it really is.  I manage a staff of 7 in an office of 30.  I've been with my company for 8 years and one of my goals is to be there at least 10.  I actually like what I do, who I work with and who I work for, all important things for keeping sane.  I actually have it pretty easy, so I try not to complain too much!  Don is my husband of 4 1/2 years.  He is the most wonderful man, and I am very lucky to be in his life.  He keeps me grounded.  When I tend to get overly emotional, he's there to add a rational point of view.  We happen to agree on most things, and I think he enjoys listening to my soapbox rants which I tend to go off on every once in awhile.  Some of my hobbies include reading, cooking, wines, watching NFL games, listening to music, candle & soap making and photography (film and digital).    This is just a quick introduction as to who I am and what I am about.  I hope that you get to know me on this journey.  Enjoy the ride!

      It must be spring!  We get a plethora of white butterflies between spring and early fall, and I saw my first today.  So did Baja, and he's been on the hunt ever since.  He almost never catches one, but I love to watch him "hunt."  Anyway, seeing the butterflies reminds me that spring is just around the corner.    On that note, I have started to do some spring "refreshing" around the house.  I purchased some frames for photos that have being laying about, I hung a  urlLink lithograph  Don got me for Valentine's Day, I got some organizing bins to help me with my candle storage, etc.  I won't actually get into my Spring Cleaning until my vacation in April, but this is a good start.  Speaking of Don, I guess you're really in love when your honey still makes your heart go pitter-patter.  We both left the house this morning -- Don going to work and me to run errands.  I left a few minutes before him since I was stopping at the mailbox to drop off some bills.  I knew we were going to both go down Sepulveda Blvd., but I didn't think I would see him.  As I pulled up to the red light at Sawtelle, I looked in my rear view mirror, and saw his silver Honda coming up next to me.  He pulled along side, and I rolled down my window to make a salacious remark (something about, "Are you going my way?").  I smiled the whole way to my first errand -- just because I saw him.  It's amazing how, even after almost 8 years together, the sight of him takes my breath away.  It must be spring!  I make fun of a lot of things, especially things I see on T.V. infomercials.  This morning, I saw an ad for the  urlLink EggStractor  and I just gota good laugh out of it.  I mean, how hard is it to peel an egg?  I guess this is in reponse to the many who are on Atkins.  I am a total gaget gal, but I have to draw the line at this!  Try as I might, exercise has not been a priority.  We did take the dogs for a short walk yesterday and I was winded after 1/2 a mile.  It was disappointing, but it was nice to get outside.  I am going to try for the gym tomorrow, and even if I don't make 60 minutes on the treadmill, I'll feel accomplished just getting into the gym!  Foods have not been good simply because nothing tastes good.  I did make turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes last night, and that tasted pretty good -- very much comfort food.  Of course, the foods that "sound" good -- mac & cheese, risotto, mashed potatoes, etc. -- are all carbs and BAD BAD BAD.  But they still sound good....  Off to go clean up the mess I've made by dragging out the tool box.  Also, a nap is sounding godd right about now....

      We survived the rain and the floods!  Actually, I was able to get home about 30 minutes before the skies opened up.  For some reason, I still have a funky taste in my mouth that makes everything taste metallic.  Nothing tastes good, which is why I didn't eat hardly anything yesterday.  I am getting breakfast from the cafe downstairs today.  I still have that taste in my mouth, but I am really hungry (gee, imagine that).  Work is going OK for the moment.  I'm still having some frustrating moments, and sometimes I think I'm close to the breaking point.  I have one girl, whom I have spoken to on several occassions about personal phone calls, on one right now that's lasted 10 minutes.  Yesterday, she was on one for over 30 minutes.  I am going to have to talk to her yet again and threaten her with counseling.  Another girl is ticked off I spoke to her about her getting in late in the morning and getting back late from lunch -- 62 tardy minutes just last week.  She complained to my boss I was being insensitive because she HAD to go home at lunch to visit her mother (her father passed away last year).  She never once told me about this, she just took it upon herself to take a 75 minute lunch.  Needless to say, that's been nipped in the bud, but once again I am the "bad guy."  This is on top of the the extra work I have taken on since we're replacing the other leader in the office (although this is on hold -- more work for me!).  Don't mean to be bitter, but I keep hoping for some sort of recognition and all I got was a lousy one line on my review --  Shannin assisted manager in stepping in as an additional leadership resource for the Aerospace desk. This was very much appreciated.   That's it.  No acknowledgment of all the work I've done around their staffing, phone stats, financials, monthly client meetings, monthly reports, etc.  OK, enough bitching.  I just had to get that out there before I let it get to me.  I'm looking forward to the weekend, that's for sure.  I don't have much planned, but I really need to clean up my fridge and pantries.  I know it's not very exciting, but I always feel better when things are clean and organized.  Off to go help the staff learn how to use the new instant messaging program we have.  It's actually pretty neat, and will cut down on some of my e-mails (hopefully).

      I'm back!  Even though I have been at work all week, it's really tired me out.  I get home pretty well exhausted.  Plus, I had a ton of work and e-mails to catch up on.  I hate not being able to access my work e-mail from home.  I mean, why do I need to get 100 e-mails in two days?  I have not been able to get back into the gym, and probably won't until Saturday.  My lungs are still a little raspy when I take a deep breath, and I don't want to be hacking on the treadmill.  I guess the good news is that I am actually down a pound since the first of the month.  My foods have been so off, I just assumed I would be up 1 or 2.  I don't expect any miracles between now and next Monday, but I would love to be down just a bit.  We're expecting a big storm here this afternoon.  I'm not sure when it's supposed to hit, but I get off work at 4:00 PM, and I'm going straight home, so hopefully it won't be too bad until after I get home.  I don't mind rain, but I hate driving in it -- not because I'm afraid of the weather, just the other drivers!  Back to work!  I almost have my desk cleaned off!

      I'm still here....barely.  I thought I was feeling better, and then decided to go to Trader Joe's.  Even that little excersion tired me out.  I was sweating, panting from just getting a few items!  I guess this really shows me who is boss -- my body, not my mind.  I haven't even done that much this afternoon, yet I'm feverish and fatigued.  It ticks me off when I "think" I feel strong, only to be betrayed by my body.  I still think I can make it into work tomorrow.  At least I hope so -- I hate to think I've wasted more than half my sick days only 2 months in to the year.  I guess the good news is that I've slept through the last two nights.  I'm still tired throughout the day, but I feel somewhat rested.  My doctor won't clear me for excercise until my lungs are clear -- hopefully later this week.  I am starting to feel some cabin fever, so getting into the office will be a good thing.  My foods have been spotty at best.  I'm eating a lot of things I shouldn't under the guise of "not feeling well."  But even the stuff I shouldn't be eating, like ice cream, doesn't taste good, so I don't even know why I'm eating it!    We're supposed to be getting some more rain today -- it's been "partly"cloudy today, but it looks like rain now.  I'm really hoping for some cooler temps this evening so we can build a fire for tonight's "Sex in the City" finale.  I don't know how the show should end, but I hope she doesn't choose Mr. Big.  That seems like such a cop out to me.  Off to rest some more.  I'm getting tired of resting, but at least I'm getting a lot of reading done!

      Now I know why I've been feeling so cruddy -- I have bronchitis.  Even with this diagnosis, I was happy that my doctor noticed my weight loss and my good blood pressure.  I also got a call from my new doctor who got my blood work back and everything is normal, but he wants to work on my thyroid -- exactly what I've been saying!  Anyway, I have two inhalers to help me breathe, and they seem to be working.  I'm still feeling fatigued and I tend to wheeze when I breathe.  I did get the rest of the day off, and an excuse for tomorrow.  The thing that has me a little ticked off is that I know how I got this -- one of the girls (the one who called me La Gorda) has been sick for the last month, and she didn't want to take any time off.  In the end, about 7 or 8 people have gotten sick, and I really believe it's because of her not taking any time off when she was ill.  What is it about these people who are so self-absorbed?  She didn't want to take time off, so those of us who did get sick had to?  I mean, I could have gone against doctor's orders and gotten everyone else sick.  The sad thing is, several people have complained about this girl -- she seems to always come in sick, but use her sick days for car problems.  So instead of her using her sick days, the 8 of us have to use ours.  It just doesn't seem fair.  So what am I going to do?  I can't go to the gym, although maybe the steam room might be good.  Daytime T.V. sucks.  OK, I admit to watching "The Young and the Restless" (Don got me hooked), but there really isn't that much on.  I'm trying to read, but I just don't seem to have the concentration.  I'd like to try and clean, but I'm not that inspired.  I'm not one for naps, no matter how badly I slept the night before.  Don will be home most of the day Friday, all day Saturday and working Sunday.  I don't even have the energy to make candles or soaps (plus I have a ton of made projects just waiting for me to give them away!).  I guess the good news in all of this is that I am not hungry -- nothing tastes good.  About the only thing that feels good is warm liquid (soup, tera, Cream of Wheat) or fizzy drinks (club soda).  I might even drop a few more pounds between now and next Wed.  I really didn't want to get on the scale at the doctor's office, but it showed a loss from last week, and a big loss since the last time I was in her office.  I actually have hope that between my exercise, foods and (hopefully) my new thyroid treatment will help me get over this hump.  Sorry for the meandering blog today, but I just can't seem to think straight.

      What a rainy day here in Southern California.  We need it, so it's actually welcomed.  Of course, I can say that because I am ensconced at home for the rest of the day.  I came home at 1P to finish writing my staff reviews.  I had my review with my boss today and it went very well.  No big surprises.  She has high expectations, so getting the rating of "Meeting Expectations" is very nice.  She rated me higher than I did in some catagories.  Overall, it was a very good meeting and I have some specific goals for next year.  My interview also went well.  I still am not sure I have the experience they need in this position.  It's very project oriented, and I haven't had the chance to participate on a lot of large scales projects.  I did send a thank you note, and he responded he appreciated my professionalism.  As I told Don, I may not have gotten this job, but I think I did make a good impression.  Even if I don't get this job, I am feeling more confident about my current job.  Often times, after meeting with my boss, I do feel re-energized.  Well, the rest of the day will be spent trying to feel better.  My cough has not gotten better, and I find it hard to even think about exercising.  My eating has not been on plan, either.  I've been eating a lot of soup and drinking a lot of liquids, but I also have been eating a lot more carbs than usual -- crackers with the soup, etc.  I'm really trying not to weigh myself until next Wednesday when I have my nutritionist appointment, but it's hard not to take a peek.  I'm worried that the carbs, the increase sodium intake (eating prepared foods) and the lack of exercise will mean a gain instead of a loss, even though I'm probably eating fewer calories than usual.  Oh, well.  Just one more friggin' setback.  I just want to feel better.  I hate being sick!

      Just taking a quick break from writing reviews -- oh, joy.  The one thing I have to say about AMEX is that we do have a great review system.  I don't dislike writing them since I have a pretty good team.  I don't even hate delivering them.  It just gets so repetitive, especially the goals area.  Luckily, I am the master of cut-n-paste.  I have to make sure I change the names for each one though.    And, partly because of writing reviews and partly because I feel like crap, I am working from home.  It's not too bad -- sitting on the couch, watching Jerry Springer and writing reviews.  I'm hoping to get the goal section done for my staff this morning (I have 4 done so far) and then write the rest after my interview, which is at 4:00 PM.  I am excited about this.  I still don't know if I have the exact skill set that's needed, but I'm hoping they will allow for a bit of a learning curve.  Off to finish my reviews!

      What a relaxing weekend!  Just what the doctor ordered after my crummy week.  Even my blood pressure was down enough for my doctor to actually prescribe 60 day's worth and I don't have to see him for 6 weeks.    Don and I had a wonderful 3 days.  We even laid out on the deck Saturday afternoon.  We did one walk with the dogs and one day at the gym.  Dinner was amazing, as usual.  I did have a few "observations," however.  It seemed that because it was Valentine's Day, they crammed people in.  The noise level was pretty loud.  The thing that really stuck in my craw was that I saw 4 people on cell phones, including the couple on either side of us.  That just really bugged me.  I would have been so offended if Don took a call in the middle of a romantic dinner.  That is impossible, of course, because Don doesn't own a cell phone (will wonders never cease?).  Also, one of the couples next to us needed to get a room.  Do I really need to watch two people tongue wrestle as I dine?  I don't think so.    I think I was just in a snarky mood because I was not feeling my best.  As it turns out, I have caught what everyone else in my office has been suffering from.  I'm running a low-grade fever, sore throat, dry cough, overall malaise, chest congestion, etc.  I can only hope I can nip it in the bud before it turns in to something really ugly.  Of course, I could use a day or two off, but I'd rather not give up 2 sick days.  I may see about using some vacation time at the end of the week if I'm not feeling better.  We'll have to play it by ear.  We did see two films this weekend -- "Lost in Translation" and "The Cooler."  We both thought "Lost in Translation" was OK, but not really Oscar worthy.  We did love "The Cooler" -- very well written and some great performances, especially Alec Baldwin.  I really hope he wins.  Off to try and get some work done in this abbreviated work day.

      First of all, thank you to everyone who posted comments or e-mailed me.  After such a horrible experience, it really made me feel like I am not alone in this fight.  As my nutritionist said, "Shannin, you are so much better than this girl.  You know it, I know it and everyone who is important to you knows it.  Yes, her comments hurt, but, in the end, you are NOT going to let some petty comment from some tiny, immature person derail your progress.  She can't even hold your handbag, much less cast a shadow over your radiant light."  And you know what, I am not going to let this comment drag me down.  My ego and self-esteem are a little bruised.  I woke up at 4:00 this morning and really did not want to come in and face these people.  I am not going to hide -- I have nothing to be ashamed of.  I have more pride than that.  Even if I did have fantasies of having these people disintegrate before my withering stares,  I am going to be so professional to them today -- kill them with appropriate behavior (I can't promise kindness, I'm still to angry).  In the end, they will be written up.  My boss was very supportive and saw the same flippant attitude I did when she spoke to them.  As she said, "You can't always teach common decency."  So, a big Thank You to my mom and dad for bring me up just right.  I did struggle with my foods yesterday.  I choose not to eat anything but a plum and then was really hungry last night.  I did have a pastrami sandwich but only ate half (saved some for the dogs).  The scale showed it this morning.  I think it's because it was so salty.  I'll have to pound the water and make sure I go to the gym tonight.  The good news is that I have tomorrow off with Don, so I will have the weekend to regroup.  Of course, now I am afraid of eating in front of my co-workers.  Isn't that stupid?  It's not like I am not chowing Super Sized McDonald's Value Meals or whole pizzas.  I don't usually partake in the goodies that are brought in from vendors.  I'm just worried that I might retreat to the other end of the spectrum and not eat at all, which according to my nutritionist, is just as bad as over eating.  The quote that got me through the day yesterday is an oldie, but a goodie, "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can break my heart."  May I always think twice about saying something that may cause another to feel pain.

      I am writing this blog with tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat.    I don't often think of myself as being a target of bigotry, and maybe I'm a little sheltered.  However that image came shattering down today.  I was finishing up a diversity call while monitoring the phones at the office today.  I noticed a call holding for a few minutes and noticed that one of the agents was on an intercom call speaking to one of the other girls in the back.  I muted my call and called over to this girl and asked her to take the call.  I overheard her say, "I gotta go, La Gorda wants me to take a call."  I don't speak a lot of Spanish, but I do know that La Gorda means "the fat one."  I literally saw red.  My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my jaw clentched, my hands started to shake, tears welled in my eyes and my voice caught in my throat.  The first thing I did was to confront the person in the back.  I pulled her aside and told her I did not appreciate being called that.  She said, "OK," and walked out of the conference room without any apology.  I went back on to the reservations floor, and one of the other Team Leaders asked me what was going on.  I filled her in, and she was as amazed and angry as I.  We both pulled the agent in who said that, and again no apology.  As she walked out of the conference room, she even chuckled like it was no big deal.  We called her back in, and she gave some lame excuse that Latins come up with nicknames for each other.    My boss isn't in the office yet, but I did write an e-mail to her and this agent's leader.  The sad part is, the second girl obviously knew who "La Gorda" was, so I have to wonder who else in the office calls me that.  The funny part, if you can find a funny part, is the girl who called me this is at least as big as I am.  I'm calmer now.  I did have a good cry over the phone with Don, who, as always, was supportive.  I am trying with all my might to stay cool and collected (and not shoot the offending parties -- with an evil eye).  I will demand this gets resolved immediately, and I am in support of putting these two on counseling (this is something pretty severe, and it the first step to getting fired).  I will finish out the day with professionalism, even though all I want to do is run home and crawl into bed.

      OK, I am going to fess up right now.  I am not going to the gym.  I should -- I know I should.  But I think that what I really need is to go to Macy's and Robinson's and hit the Estee Lauder & Clinique counters.  Hey, gift with purchase -- who can refuse them?  My rationalization is this -- I feel like I want to reward myself (for what, I'm not even certain), and I cannot do it with food (as much as I'd like to).  I actually need some stuff, I'll get a little sumthin-sumthin in return and it doesn't have any calories!  I am then going to go home and finish reading  urlLink The Five People You Meet in Heaven .  I am only a few pages in, and it's a very engaging story about an 83-year old man who dies and goes to heaven to discover that heaven is really a place that 5 people explain your life.  It's written by Mitch Albom who also wrote  urlLink Tuesdays with Morrie .  Off to shop 'til I drop!

      I didn't make it to the gym yesterday, despite my good intentions.  All hell broke loose at the office -- people calling in sick, call volume up about 25% over a normal Monday.  The only thing that could have capped it off was if the phones or computers went down.  My gym plans were foiled because I ended up staying until 5:15 PM, and I needed to be home by 5:30 since the dogs were outside.  I also ended up getting off of my food schedule a little, but I did eat all of my meals and I did it on plan.  The only little slip was a few handful of crackers around 2 PM.  I really wanted to binge.  I really thought I "deserved" something special for all the hard work I was doing -- ice cream, Mexican food, chips.  Ahhh, but I didn't.  I was tempted to even order Mexican food last night, but I grilled up some tasty sausages (chicken with habanero chilies) and tossed together a small salad.  My real reward for being on plan -- down 2 pounds this morning.  This made me happy, of course, but I still don't seem satisfied.  Why can't I just be happy about this?  Today is looking ugly, but not nearly as ugly as yesterday.  Some of the incidents over the last few months and especially the last few weeks, are making me seriously consider my career path.  I just don't like managing people.  I don't like the fact that my review is partially based on my direct reports' performance and if they like me.  I'm having a hard time with a few of the employees "talking behind my back" and I hate feeling like I'm in high school.  I get a long well with my peers and management and most of the staff, but there is one or two I would love to foist on to another leader.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed on the job interview next week.  I just hope it's something that is really interesting and stable.  I'm on plan so far with my breakfast.  I am still fighting the urge to binge.  I'd love to be able to go into my nutritionist appointment tomorrow down 2 pounds.  Why is this such a struggle??

      The weekend was very nice.  The weather was great, I got some errands done, went to the gym on Saturday and burned 700 calories on the treadmill and went for a 1 1/2 mile walk with Don and the dogs on Sunday.  Food was OK, but not great.  I did fine until Saturday dinner and then, once again, decided to take the easy way out and went to get Paco's instead of cooking something.  I did fine on my Sunday meals, however I missed all of my fruit snacks.  I have the hardest time getting all of my snacks in over the weekend.  I usually don't have an issue during the work week since I'm on a schedule.  Guess I'll have to work on that.  The bottom line is that I am the exact same weight as I was last week.  My plans for this week will mirror last week -- gym on Monday, Tuesday, Friday and at least once over the weekend.  I have a 3-day weekend with Don, and I am really looking forward to that.  I don't have Monday off, so Don and I both took Friday off.  We don't have any big plans over the weekend -- we will be going to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants,  urlLink Crustacean  for Valentine's Day.  It's a wonderful place.  The front wall of the restaurant is a huge fish tank that continues into the restaurant on the floor.  The have a secret kitchen that only the family can enter.  We always get their grilled prawns and garlic noodles.  Talk about heaven on a plate!   Off to schedule the rest of my busy week.

      So today wasn’t the picture-perfect day I wanted.  I didn’t have the perfect breakfast – choosing to order from the on-site café over eating my oatmeal.  I also overate at lunch, choosing a tostada salad from El Pollo Loco instead of my protein and veggie meal.    I’d like to write this off as nerves before confronting Z.  My meeting with her went well – I don’t think I told her anything that surprised her.  After getting that over, I thought my day would be downhill, but she asked to speak to me 10 minutes before I was supposed to leave.  She asked if her attendance was the reason she would not be getting the “year end” award.  I had to say yes, and she broke into tears.  In the end, I really think we made some great strides.  It was hard for me, because I don’t like to be a hard-ass.  I really wanted to reward her, but I cannot justify this.  I think that because I hate confrontation, I overate this morning to “fortify” me.  And then, this afternoon, overate to “reward” myself – once again turning to food as a reward.  I also didn’t make it to the gym.  When I got out of work, it was 5:15, and it gets dark at about 5:30 and the dogs were outside.  Isn’t it funny that my dogs’ well-being is more important than my own?  I know that I will have to do 60 minutes on the treadmill on Saturday and Sunday.  So be it.  I am going to spend the rest of the night relaxing and catching up on my TiVo programming (Survivor, CSI, Law & Order).    Tomorrow is another day.

      Surprise, surprise....I was actually down 3 pounds in two weeks according to my nutritionist scale.  I have also posted my food plan for the week on the right hand side.  As you can see, I do get a lot of foods, and no real restrictions, although right now I am not eating bread carbs (potatoes, pasta, rice, etc.).  This plan is supposed to accelerate weight loss to get me on the right track.  I've done pretty well today, although I did miss meal two because I was meeting with my boss.  Work really kicked my ass last night.  I directly manage a team of 7, and 90% of the time they are great.  Every once in awhile, one of them pitches a fit.  One woman, I'll call Z, is getting a little too big for her britches.  She passive-aggressively asked my boss why I hadn't given out any recognition for last year.  Of course, my boss wanted to know what the heck that meant, seeing how I had given out plenty of awards, including one award to her plus a huge thank you and a 1/2 day off (paid) for doing a great job.  Anyway, she continued to whine about her lack of recognition to several other people in the office.  And, here's the kicker.....we have a yearly program where the top 7% of the agents get a all-expense paid trip to some where fabulous (this year it's San Juan, Puerto Rico).  The next 7% of the agents get a plaque and a $250.00 gift check.  I really wanted to recognize Z for some of the great work she did, despite some issues I actually overlooked (some attendance and personal phone call issues).  She called in sick (hangover) on Monday and then told me that on Tuesday.  One of my duties is to also monitor phone calls to review customer service.  I caught her on a personal call talking "inappropriately" with someone who was not her husband.  And she has the gall to complain she doesn't get recognized?  She came in hungover today, and she just left because she wasn't feeling well.  I really wanted to talk to her today, but it looks like I'll have to deal with it tomorrow.  Hopefully it won't be another sleepless night.  Why do I stress out over this stuff?  Because I care too damn much!  So, no nail appointment tonight, which is fine.  Since I didn't sleep very well last night, it's going to be nice to get home early and relax.  I will go to the gym tomorrow, as planned.    As a reminder, tomorrow is  urlLink National Women Wear Red Day  to raise awareness of heart disease in women.  Please join me in wearing red tomorrow!

      To be 100% honest, I could not complete 60 minutes on the treadmill last night.  My legs were just too dead.  I mean, when was the last time I actually did 4 days in a row?  I don't even think I can tell you.  Also, I was working out next to this woman who was really bugging me.  I know I shouldn't focus on others when I am working out, but it was hard not to.  When I am on a treadmill, I don't care if those on either side of me are running or walking -- as long as they have a consistent pace.  This woman would walk about 2 minutes and then get off the machine. She was reading the newspaper and every single time she turned the page, she would have to step off.  She would also get off the machine and toss out her section of newspaper, which seemed to take 3-4 minutes, and then get back on.  In the meantime, people were waiting for the treadmill.  It was just so distracting.  And, even though I wear a Walkman, I knew she was talking to people on the other side of her, and if I didn't have my earphones on she would have tried to strike up a conversation with me.  I'll just have to avoid her in the future.  I have eaten well ever since my mini-binge on Tuesday.  I haven't gotten all of my water in today, so I'll have to work on that between now and the end of the evening.  I am meeting Don at the Baja Cantina, a local Mexican bar, which is actually where we met.  I know I can choose some of their more healthy options, like soft tacos rather than hard and they do have shrimp or chicken fajitas.  I'll just have to stay away from the alcohol.  One interesting thing happened.  I had applied a few weeks ago for a different position within my company -- completely outside of the travel realm.  I didn't think I was qualified, but I like to keep my resume and interviewing skills up-to-date.  I did speak to the hiring manager today and he wants to meet me in 2 weeks.  He did say 35 people applied, and in the first wave he was just trying to assess peoples' skill levels and he felt that I met them.  It would mean a slightly longer commute, but not that much different (and it would be going against traffic!).  I also wouldn't manage people (no more review writing!!).  I would me coordinating a staff of 8 seasoned sales managers (keeping schedules, making travel arrangements, doing expense reports, correspondence, etc.).  It is so different than what I am doing now.  I don't want to get my hopes up, but I am actually pretty excited about this opportunity.  Off to see my nutritionist.  I don't think I'm down very much from my last visit with him 2 weeks ago, but I will be posting my meal plan for the week.

      Grrrr....just when I thought I was doing well.  I actually sneaked a peak at the scale this morning and was down 2.4 pounds from Sunday morning.  I was thinking to myself, "Gee, I guess this exercise stuff really  does  work!"  I ate a sensible breakfast, had my mid-morning snack and ate a wonderful lunch.  I was sated -- not stuffed, not hungry, but for some reason felt that a small bag of cheetos (180 calories), a heath bar (210 calories) and two maple cookied (208 calories) was in order!  Why in the hell do I do this to myself?  My workout at the gym is going to have to burn 598 calories just for me to break even today.  That means I will not be able to bail 10 minutes early while complaining of sore quads.  Thanks to  urlLink Denise's  post who helped me realize I am going to have to be brutally honest with myself, which means confessing all of my dietary sins.

      OK, so I only did 45 minutes on the treadmill.  My quads and calves were killing me.  As it was, it’s an amazing thing I even made it to the gym.  The last hour at work would have driven anyone else to the nearest bar.  The other leader in the office was really ticking me off.  I needed to run some reports regarding phone stats – our office is on an Automated Call Distribution system, and we need to prove to some clients that 80% of their incoming calls are answered within 20 seconds.  I have a monthly meeting with our biggest client to show them these reports.  Our meeting is tomorrow at 8:30 AM.  All leaders are supposed to monitor our stats daily, and until recently this leader has been less than interested.  However, she is taking a new position (a demotion) and all of a sudden she is watching these stats like a hawk.  This is a touchy computer, so only one person can run a function at a time.  I had gotten her internet access at the beginning of the year, yet she still used the old way, which interferes with my running reports.  I told her I was running these reports, yet TWICE she quit my request so she could “watch the phones.”  Luckily I am in early tomorrow and will be able to run the last 4 I need before the meeting, but her attitude really pissed me off.  Despite this, I went to the gym.  I really like our gym,  urlLink The Spectrum Club .  It has a good mix of ages, races and body types.  I feel very comfortable there.  The one thing I don’t like is that the gym is 3 floors, and the cardio equipment is on the third floor, naturally.  I hate taking the stairs because I am pretty much out of breath by the time I get there.  Grrrrrr.  The other thing that got me off the treadmill a little early is because the T.V. that I was watching was showing CNN.  Normally not a problem, but they must have showed Janet Jackson’s breast 30 times in the 45 minutes I was there.  I thought about turning CNN into the FCC for “indecent exposure.”  I guess since most everyone has already seen it (a hundred times!), I didn’t think they needed to run it anymore.  My personal thoughts – it was staged.  "Wardrobe malfunction"  my ass.  It’s all about ratings, baby.  I did come home and sauté up a few chicken breasts with garlic, onions, mushrooms and sweet peppers.  It does smell great in here, even though I’m not really hungry.  I really should go and do dishes, but I keep hoping they will magically disappear when I’m done here.  The rest of the night should be pretty quiet.  It's raining, which is a nice change for Southern California.  We need it.  Of course, my ideal for a rainy, cold day is to be at home, in PJs & slippers, with a roaring fire, drinking hot chocolate and reading a really good book.  I guess I can be grateful that my commute is 3 miles and usually less than 10 minutes.  Off to go pack my gym bag for tomorrow.  I also need to finish up my breakfast & lunch as well.  I keep hoping that I won't have to go to my meeting, but I've dodged the last two, so I know that isn't in the cards.

      What a weekend.  The weather here was wonderful.  I made it to the gym on Saturday and for a walk with Don and the dogs on Sunday.  We ate well while we watched the Super Bowl -- a huge platter of fresh veggies, some olives, nuts, cold shrimp and baked chicken wings. The good thing is that we noshed from about 1:00 PM until halftime.  We each had a few beers, but nothing that would break the bank.  We also had some fat-free sorbet for dessert.  Yum!  I can tell you there are a lot of great things about not seeing an event like the Super Bowl live.  No standing in lines (security, concessions, restrooms), you don't have to pay $7 for a beer or $5 for water, you can wear your slippers, your dogs can watch with you, you don't have to deal with parking, TiVO (to replay the end of the halftime show just to make sure you saw what you thought you saw).......I could go on.  One of the best things was that I got to watch it with Don, and that really made my day.  I have my gym bag packed for after work.  My goal is another 60 minutes on the treadmill.  I figure if I can hit the gym Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and one day over the weekend, I will get back on track.  Off to wade through all of my e-mails.  I can't believe that in one day out of the office, I got 71 new e-mails. No wonder I never get anything done!

      I've noticed I am playing more and more games with myself when it comes to food and exercise.  If I don't eat dinner (protein & veggies), I'll have some ice cream because the calories are about the same.  You know, you really get the same benefit from doing 30 minute of cardio as you do for 60 minutes of cardio, plus if I do 30 minutes, I can get in some weight lifting.    I swear, I can rationalize almost anything, and my eating and exercise patterns are showing it.  The thing that makes me real angry is that I   KNOW   what I need to do:   1. Follow my food plan 2. Eat more protein than carbs 3. Eat 5 servings of fresh fruit and veggies EVERY day 4. Exercise 5 times a week with 60 minutes of cardio and some weight lifting 5. Drink at least 100 ounces of water a day 6. Take my supplements & prescriptions 7. Do not skip my appointments with my doctor or my nutritionist   See, it can't be that hard.  I have seriously got to get my act together.  It looks like I am going to weigh in at 314  AGAIN  this month.  And I can't even act surprised.  I worked out about 6 or 7 times last month.  I probably ate on plan only 1 or 2 days.  Heck, it's a miracle that I haven't gained 10 pounds!  What can I do to scare myself straight?  How can I stop playing these games with my health and my future?

      Boy, oh boy was it hard to come into work this morning!  I had a great weekend, enjoying our 88 degree weather!  Don and I spent time on Saturday and Sunday out on the deck.  My brother and his family were in from Las Vegas, so we had dinner with them Saturday night and brunch on Sunday.  Needless to say, I'm staying as far away from the scale as possible until I have a few more on plan days under my belt.  This morning, I didn't come into work until 9 AM, so I actually went to the gym before work.  It got the day started off right -- a little cardio, a little weight lifting.  Of course, once I got home, grabbed some coffee and collapsed on the deck chair with the dogs, I seriously contemplated calling in "sick" but I have too much of a tan for that to be believable!  Of course, I am still in count down mode -- 10 more working days for those of you counting -- to my vacation.  Although I have a lot to do -- getting the carpets & chimney cleaned, general home maintenance, etc. -- I do plan on getting some shopping in as well as a lot of deck time (in case you haven't noticed, I am a true sun bunny).  Don will have Wednesday - Sunday off, so that will be nice to be able to spend some time together.  With our incompatible schedules, it's hard to keep up with one another, especially when he gets home at 12:30 AM and I am out the door at 7:30 AM.  That's about all from here.  As I look out the window, I am once again tempted to get in my car and go home for lunch -- I'm just afraid I wouldn't come back!  P.S. -- For my friends in "cooler" areas of the country, we are actually expecting about a 30 degree drop by Wednesday or Thursday, plus the possibility of showers......

      Thanks for all the e-mails and comments.  I have my one-on-one with my manager next Friday and I will bringing up a lot of these points.  In the meantime, I have taken a blank review sheet and I am keeping track of all the extras I'm doing so when I do get ready for my year end, it will be almost written!  Heck, it's what I suggest to my staff, I might as well follow my own advice.  In the meantime, no real adventures this past week.  My most exciting was a last minute meeting downtown.  Because of the morning rush hour I took surface streets through, ummm, let's call it, the seedier part of town.  I did see a lot of interesting places that I had no idea even existed in the city.  The meeting was for one of our city government clients near Union Station.  The Union Station security guards were on  urlLink Segways .  I had never seen one in person and I was a little disappointed I didn't get to see them in action.  Oh, well.... I should have taken my camera though.....Union Station would be such a cool building to photograph.  It looks like it's going to be a busy weekend.  My brother and his family is coming in for the weekend, so there are "event" planned -- dinner at my Dad's on Friday, dinner at my Mom's on Saturday and brunch at my Dad's on Sunday.  I think we'll probably only do the Saturday and Sunday events since Don is working late on Friday and I really don't want to schlep all the way to my Dad's during rush hour on Friday.  Ok, if you twisted my arm, the real reason is because I don't want to leave the dogs alone ( urlLink Rebecca  -- are you reading??).  I don't want to have to leave them alone after I've been at work all day and they've been stuck in the dog run.  I'm such a home-body.....  Anyway, I'm counting down the days until my week off (t-16 working days!).  Here's too a relaxing weekend.

      .....you do a good job, meet your deadlines, take on extra projects/responsibilities, manage extra staff and you get no raise and less of a bonus than last year on top of being asked to change your hours.  OK, yes a little more job bitterness.  I knew in December that I needed to get an overall 1 or 2 on my review to be eligible for a raise this year.  I also knew that more than likely I would receive a 3 -- meeting expectations -- despite taking on a lot of work last year.  I did struggle at times with the workload, but I always met my deadlines, I didn't bitch about it and always showed flexibility and excellent change management skills.  I was disappointed in my review because I thought some of the extras deserved recognition.  I also assumed that my bonus would be more than last year to compensate the fact I wasn't getting a raise.  In the end, my bonus was about $150.00 less than last year and no bonus, so I am actually "out" about $42.00 a paycheck after taxes (enough to fill my gas tank and get my nails done).  It still ticks me off that I worked harder and smarter than I did in 2002, and am getting less for the effort.  Which is why I am hesitant to jump in on the next fabulous project my manager wants me to undertake.  As I've mentioned, one of the other leaders is moving on, but we haven't replaced her yet.  I have been asked to take on 3 pretty big duties of hers to add to mine until we bring in her replacement.  So knowing I'll be making less money for doing more, my boss then tells me (she couched as "discussing" it with me, but there was no discussion) that my hours need to change from 7a - 4p to 8a - 5p.  I have been working my shift for about 6 of my 8 years here and it hasn't seemed to bother anyone but her.  She claims I need to be more visible, that strong leadership is needed more in the late afternoon than in the morning.  I like working my early shift.  I'm an early bird as it is.  I like getting off at 4p so I can go to the store or the gym before everyone else gets off of work.  To have that taken away from me on top of the money thing, really doesn't do a lot for my sense of teamwork or willingness to go the extra mile.  I guess I just see others in the office who make a big show about how much work they have to do and they make sure everyone knows they are staying late and they get projects and tasks taken off their plates.  They earn extra days off (comp time) because they are putting in so much OT (since we're exempt, we can't get paid OT).  I work efficiently, without a lot of direction.  I meet my deadlines.  I offer to help out my peers when I can.  I have never said no to my boss when she's asked me to finish a project (usually due within 24 hours) because she has gotten behind.  I do stay late when it's warranted (people calling in sick and the phones need to be covered).  I've come in as early as 3 AM to support our East Coast offices when they are affected by winter storms or black outs.  I support my company thought its many changes and work on making sure my staff supports us as well.  Maybe it's because I have been so generously compensated in the past that this feels a little like a slap in the face.  If it weren't for the tight job market, I would seriously think about quitting.  Again, sorry for the bitter grapes, but this job situation is the one stress area in my life right now, and the one that is at the root cause of my trying to self-medicate, whether by wine or by Big Macs.

      It's amazing how some names really evoke certain emotions.  I love my name.  In Gaelic, Shannon means "wise one."  I'm not always sure if that holds true, but I like to think it is.  The spelling of my name is an interesting story.  I was adopted.  My mom had lost two unborn babies and my parents decided it would be best to adopt.  They put as their preference "First Available."  They were originally told a baby boy was going to be available, so they thought of boy names and came up with Gavin.  When they went down to Children's Home Society on their appointed day, they were told that the boy had become ill and would not be up for adoption for a few weeks, however they did have a little girl (me!) ready to go home.  My parents were sent off to go to lunch while the paperwork was completed.  Since it was lunch time, my parents decided to grab a bite to eat at a well-known Mexican place called El Cholo.  Over a few margaritas, my parents tried to come up with a girl's name.  They wanted something that honored my soon-to-be father's Irish heritage and came up with two -- Erin Elizabeth or Shannon Michele.  My mom is an artist, and therefore a visual person, so she started to doodle the names along with Gavin.  Because of the "i" in Gavin, she started spelling Shannon as Shannin and that's how I came to be named Shannin Michele.    Growing up, I never loved my name -- it was always spelled wrong and it wasn't "cute" and I could never have a nickname (Tina from Christina, Patty from Patricia, Shelly from Michelle).  Of course, now that I'm older, I appreciate the fact that Shannon/Shannin will never be one of the top 10 names -- heck, Shannon was considered a boy's name for most of the 60s.  I became very posessive of my name.  I loved the fact no one shared my name -- at least the spelling.  Which brings me to my last Leadership Meeting last week.  I knew we had hired a leader at one of our on-sites and her name was Shannon, but I had yet to meet her -- until last Thursday.  When we did finally meet face-to-face, she said, "Oh, so you're the OTHER Shannin."  What do you mean, the OTHER Shannin????  Hey, when it comes to this group, I am THE Shannin!  See what I mean about becoming posessive?  Oh well, at least I spell it different!  The other funny thing about names, are the images that they can conjure up.  In the end, when my mom did finally get pregnant, she had a boy who she named Gavin (their original name).  I don't know too many Gavins, but my best friend's cousin is named Gavin.  We "hooked up" in college, but it was a very short-lived relationship.  I finally confessesd to my friend I just couldn't imagine lying in bed saying, "Ohhh, Gavin....yes, harder....."  Just too weird.....

      I got some bad news yesterday.  My mom's best friend, Nancy, has been given 3 - 4 months to live.  Nancy and my mom met when I was 2 and Nancy's daughter was also 2 -- we're actually only 3 weeks apart in age.  My brother was 6 months and Jackie's brother was 3 months, so you can see our families were very similar.    Our families used to do summer vacations together.  Even though as we grew up, Jackie and I kind of went our different ways, we remaind friends.  I was there for Jackie Nancy was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I was there for her when her aunt had a radical masectomy.  I was there when Jackie discovered a lump in her breast.  This has not been a lucky family.  One of Jackie's aunts died of ovarian cancer.  Jackie lost her second child, a 3 week old boy, to SIDS in 2001.  Nancy survived breast cancer only to find that some of the cancer cells settled in her liver and bones.  I had been relying on my mom for information about Nancy, not wanted to bother Nancy.  I had left a message for Jackie a few weeks ago and she finally called last week and we had about a 2 hour talk.  At this time, no doctor had answered the question, "How much time?"  Jackie had come to terms about her mom's impending death, sort of.  She admitted she knew it was going to happen, and knew it was going to be sooner than later, but I don't really think she realized that we were talking soon, real soon.  My mom, in total denial, still thinks that Nancy can beat this, that she has a year.  After a very long phone conversation with her last night, I think I was finally able to get her to acknowledge that Nancy will probably be gone before the end of summer.  Death is not something I'm comforable with.  I was not exposed to it a lot -- when my 4 grandparents passes, my parents opted for no ceremonies.  I think my first memorial service was when I was in junior high and one of my friend's brother died in a hiking accident.  I hadn't even been to a funeral (with a body in the same room) until 7 years ago when my friend Shoba died in a plane crash.  Even then, it was a closed casket because of the nature of the accident.  My first open casket funeral was in 2000 when a friend's wife died of cancer (didn't handle that well at all -- I ended up having a panic attack).  Needless to say, it's not a topic I like discussing, writing about or even thinking about.    Having said that, death is inevitable for all of us.  The person who served you your latte this morning?  He's going to die.  Your co-worker?  Boss?  Workout partner?  Yep -- we just don't know when or how most of the time.  In Nancy's case, she does know.  Most cancer victims die of liver failure due to a drug overdose.  Ironic -- the drugs they give you to relieve the pain is what essentially kills you.  Not the cancer, but the drugs.  She even knows, for the most part, how much time she has.  She doesn't have the strength to take the trip to Europe she's always wanted to do, but she does have the chance to gather those she loves and tell them that.  I guess in a way, that's one of the benefits of knowing.  So, how am I going to handle this?  This is the first time that I've really known anyone who has been given a time limit.  I know my role is going to be supporting my mom and Jackie.  I also know I am going to have to go and see Nancy within the next few weeks, no matter how hard it is for me.  The upside of this is the open discussions I was able to have with my dad. my mom and Don.  These aren't easy conversations, and there were some tears, but they are important, and I do encourage you all to have them with those you love.  Anyway, not to put a damper on everyone's Friday, but I wanted to get this down before I let it fade to the background like I do on all uncomfortable topics.  "You can't choose how you are going to die, or when.  You can only choose how you are going to live, now."

      That's "To your heath," in Gaelic, in honor of my national holiday.  Despite my Irish heritage, I tend to down play St. Patrick's Day.  Seven years ago, I got a call on St. Paddy's Day to tell me that one of my close friends had died in a private plane crash.  Ever since then, my taste for green beer, drunken happy hours, etc. has dwindled.  Don and I will probably grab a bite to eat, but no green beer (I mean, really, what's the point?).  I'm a little calmer than yesterday.  I really sat here and stewed about the way my boss treated me.  I even typed up a fake resignation letter (in Word, not in e-mail so there wouldn't be any "accidents").  I found out later that right before she spoke to me she found out she was losing an account and she would have to lay off 2 people including 1 who is still out on maternity leave.  I guess I'll cut her some slack.  I'll just try and be a little more proactive about making sure the office is covered when other leaders are out.  I am in another rather annoyed mood.  I went to Aaron Brothers to pick up my mats I had custom cut and they weren't ready.  The woman told me that they should be ready around 5P.  Of course, when I placed my order on Sunday, the guy didn't tell me that.  So that was one wasted trip.  I went to pick up my B/W enlargements from Marina Photo and discovered the negatives got mixed up and all but 2 of the prints were wrong!  Grrrrr.....so back to the drawing board on those.  I should be getting my digital photo enlargements from  urlLink Shutterfly  today so I can start working on getting those bad boys framed.  Off to finish picking my NCAA bracket.  Don and I always play against one another.  I think he's won the last two years and it would be nice to beat him this year, although it's hard since I don't follow college hoops like I follow college football.  Let's just say, my "good" picks are more luck than anything.  Although I have several Irish toasts, here is one that I think is especially appropriate:  "As you slide down the banister of life, May the splinters never point the wrong way!"  Hope everyone has a safe and relatively sane St. Patrick's Day!

      There are days where I seriously hate my job.  The other leader in the office was off yesterday and will be off today.  I work 7:00 AM - 4:00 PM and she usually works 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.  I came in yesterday at my usual time and left at my usual  time.  I got a voicemail this morning from my boss wondering why I didn't stay until 6:00 PM since the office needs a leader here between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.  This means, I have to stay until 6:00 PM today -- forcing me to cancel two appointments and make alternate arrangements for other plans.  I mean, at least she could have called me at home so I could have 24 hours notice.    It's not that I'm asked to work extra hours (and don't get compensated for them, being exempt and all).  What really gets me is that when I am off, no leader comes in at 7:00 AM, and no one is expected to work 11 hours.    Admittedly, I'm in a rather pissy mood.  The other team leader has taken another position (a step down) and my boss hasn't even hired a new TL (we've done the interviews, but the one she wants needs a green card) so I am expected to take on a bunch of extra work for no extra compensation.  This is the second time in 2 years this has happened and I've had it.  Sorry for venting this early in the morning, but I'm really ticked off......

      I guess the good news is that I didn't have to fight with food cravings/desires too much this weekend.  I did have a steak and a baked potato last night (I did nearly orgasm over the potato -- hey, it's been a long time) but I stopped when I was full (the dogs got lucky!).  I also made it to the gym for 30 minutes of cardio on Saturday and took the beasts for a 1 1/2 mile walk today.    The bad news is I really don't feel like I'm making much progress on the weight loss fight.  I know I have benefited from some of the weight loss I have had -- looser clothes for one.  But I am still feeling like a lard ass.  Despite some of my "old" clothes fitting better, I feel like I'm in a bad plateau.  I've even considered asking my nutritionist about a 3- or 5-day fast to "re-start" my engine.    I was able to get some of my photos framed and hung.  I'm just waiting for some mats to be cut and some enlargements to be delivered.  I even ordered some 8x10s -- which is a huge step for me because I worry if my work is "good enough" for something that big.  I am really excited to see some of my works printed "big" and to get them hung.  My secret dream is to get them displayed at either my gym or my hairdresser's to see if they will sell.  I'm not sure if I have the confidence for that right now, but we'll see.

      I'm amazed how quickly time passes.  My day off is mostly over, and I've hardly done anything -- although I think that's the point of a day "off."  I went to Macy's and Bloomie's (Lancome & Clinque gift with purchase) on my way to the doctors.  Ran to Trader Joe's to get some essentials for the weekend.  I was very tempted to go next door to  urlLink Panera , the bread store so many of my fellow bloggers have recently written about.  Despite knowing their cinnamon rolls would go directly to my thighs, I have been wanting to try them for a long time.  As I was walking up the steps to the two stores, my feet carrying me in the direction of Panera's doors, I noticed the rating -- a big 'ol  B .  (For those who don't know, Los Angeles County gives any place  that serves food a letter grade -- A, B, C, D).  I have a personal thing about only eating in places that have an A, so the decision was made for me.  I even did well in TJ's -- I only got what was on my list, so there is nothing tempting me in the house tonight.  Came home, had lunch with Don and sat on the deck for about 1 1/2 hours.  Don just left for work, and I don't have any plans for the rest of the day.  Now, there are some things I should do -- go through some magazines & catalogs, order some photos for my new frames, etc.  Whether I get them done or not remains to be seen.  I may just decided on going through my virtual mall and trying not to do too much damage.  One thing I noticed while driving to my doctor's office in Beverly Hills, is just how much entitlement some people feel.  Driving through the streets, I noticed a lot of drivers just coasted through stop signs, totally ignoring who might actually have the right of way.  I saw two people (in Mercedes SUVs, natch) pull into traffic with nary a thought about oncoming traffic.  At the office, I was waiting for the elevator and this older typical BH matron (velour matching sweatsuit which probably cost a few hundred of her husband's well-earned money) stepped right in front of me as I was getting on the elevator.  She, of course, had to get out before me and even though we were both going to the same office, she didn't even hold the door.  When we got in, the receptionist asked who her doctor was, and her answer was, "I have a test at 11:30."  Luckily, I see a different set of doctors, and didn't even have chance to take my seat before I was being shown into a room.  When I left about 10 minutes later, she was still waiting.    I just find it interesting how some people interact with the strangers around them.  So many don't take into consideration how their actions affect other people.  "It's my way, when I want it, how I want it and damn the little people."    On to better things -- I did forget to mention the other day that one of the real benefits of being a Gold AMEX card holder is the ability to get tickets early for certain events.  AMEX had a promotion where I could get tickets to Sting & Annie Lennox 2 days before they went on sale to the general public.  I was so excited!  We have great seats and it took all of about 5 minutes at  urlLink Ticketmaster .  Anyway, enough gloating about that.....  Well, off to enjoy the rest of the day at my leisure.....

      My body is going through a lot of changes -- after 4 weeks of dealing with this stupic bronchitis, no exercise and eating way off plan, I am actually down 3 pounds.  I guess not being able to taste food is a good thing -- I make choices like fish instead of a hamburger.  The other upswing is that I am finding skirts (3 so far) that have been buried in the back of my closet because they have been too tight.  The are all now on the loose side!  I guess one of the things I will be doing over my week off in April is cleaning out my closet and actually donating some of the items that are on the "biggish" side.    And this all on the eve of my being cleared to get back in to the gym today!  Of course, staffing issues may postpone that until tomorrow, but I'm feeling better about my body.  Which hasn't stopped me from eating like someone who has never heard of the word "nutrition."  I mean, 1 Diet Coke, 4 small chocolate eggs and 1 piece of garlic bread is all I ate yesterday.  So far today, I've had juice and some Chex Mix.  Of well, if I continue to lose weight, I may write my own diet book -- The Venice Beach diet.

      ....single man (guessing -- no wedding ring), 40s, flipping through a Soap Opera Digest while waiting in line at Target to buy 1 liter of Coke, 2 containers of Pringles and car floor mats.  ....middle-age man in a suit on his cell phone walking down Sepulveda Blvd. at lunchtime with a blow-up Spiderman under his arm.  Both just struck me as odd.....

      Spring fever has officially set in.  I don't want to be at work, I don't want to be inside -- I just want to be outside, reading, hanging with the dogs, which is pretty much what I did all of Sunday.  Saturday, Don and I went and had our taxes done, and for the first time in the 4 years we've filed as a couple, we'll be getting a refund.  Woo-hoo.  I always am aprehensive about getting our taxes done since it's been bad news in the past, so this was a pleasant surprise.  Of course, the money is already spent on things around the house, but it's a nice feeling knowing that the money will be in our checking account in just 2 weeks.  Sunday, Don had to work and I did a major grocery/supply shop -- CostCo, Ralph's, Trader Joe's.  It actually only took me about 2 hours to get all of my errands done.  Didn't do too much damage at CostCo, which is a challenge.  I tried to stick to exactly what I needed, rather than going up and down each aisle to make sure I wasn't "missing" any good deals.  I spent the rest of the very sunny and hot (85 degrees) lying on my deck and reading.  I even have a nice tan started.  I've always been a sun bunny, and I feel so much better about myself when I have some color.  I have light olive skin anyway, so I'm never really pale, but I love to get a dark tan!  Sunday night, in preparation for the return of  urlLink  The Sopranos  I made wonderful  urlLink Beef & Cheese Manicotti  along with salad and garlic bread.  Totally not on either one of our plans, but it was a good cheat day.  I was very happy the way it came out, and the leftovers are even better.  Tonight we are taking some of the tax refund and going shopping for some window shades.  We have a very nice window seat in our living room and there are no shades, which can leave us feeling a little exposed at times.  I'm looking for the ones that are similar to  urlLink this , so wish us luck.  I'm not always very good with the home decorating stuff -- I have great ideas, I just am not very handy unless it's IKEA-type furniture.  Off to present my first round of reviews.

      Oh, boy, am I glad it's Friday.  Of course, 2 people called in sick, 2 were on approved vacation and I have 2 leaving early.  The airlines just raised their fares last night and now we have to call the carriers to honor the original fares that were supposed to be good through today.  Ahhh, the joys.....  On top of it all, I will have to deliver my reviews next week.  The thing that kills me is that I sent them to my boss on Feb. 23.  She is  just  now getting back to me with revisions and additions.  Oh, and when are the reviews due, you might ask?  Next Friday, of course.  Geeze....she's on my back to get them done early, which I did, and then they sit on her desk for almost 2 weeks, and now I have to rush to meet deadline.  After reading  urlLink Denise  however, I'm not sure if I really want to present the reviews!  I do have to agree, I have a great staff.  The one thing that gets me every year are those who fill in their self apprasials with all 1s (we rank on a scale of 1 - 5, with 3 being Meets Expectations and 1 being Exceeds Expecations Plus).    My big success last night was building  urlLink 2 bookshelves and 1 table  I purchased yesterday.  I put these in the guest room along one very bare wall.  I really need the shelf space more than anything for photos and knick-knacks.  I swear, I can't imagine where I would have put all this stuff if we were still in our old apartment.  We went from a 900 sq. foot apartment to a 1500 sq. foot house, and I'm always in seach of storage space.  I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to the weekend or not.  Don and I are seeing our tax guy tomorrow, and don't know what to expect.  We paid a little last year, but not that much.  With Don's employment issues last year and some of the freelance he did, I'm not sure if we're going to take it in the shorts or come out on top.    Other than that, I really don't have any big plans for the weekend.  I really need to get my nails done -- they look like shit.  I'll have some chores and errands, but I'm really praying for a sunny weekend so I can spend most of my time out on my deck reading.  Ahh, the simple pleasures of life.

      The rain has come again.  I actually don't mind this weather, especially because I was home before it started.  I was able to get off work a little early because my boss called me late last night to ask if I could get into the office before 6:30 AM to reboot our phone system.  The curse of living the closest to the office, I guess.  It did make for a very long day.    My weigh in this morning held no surprises -- I'm the same weight.  Since I haven't worked out in 2 weeks and my eating has not been on plan.  I guess I'm a little bit disappointed that I didn't do better, and I feel like I've been on this plateau forever.  I just don't feel on track, and that's making me feel out of sorts.  I don't know how to get back on track.    The first thing would be to get back into the gym, but looking at my schedule this week, that won't be possible until Saturday.  I have something after work every night this week -- nail appointment, hair appointment, nutritionist, client event.  I guess I should actually try something easy like stretching.    The second thing would be to stop eating all of this crap.  I know I have been sick, and that's been my excuse for the last 2 1/2 weeks, but I really need to focus on what I am putting into my body.  No more processed food (canned soups), no more fast food, no more skipping meals just because "nothing sounds good" (and then later overeating).  I have to start making my breakfast and lunch instead of buying those meals (hey, and I save money!).    Lastly, I will be seeing my doctor next Friday to have more thyroid tests so we can come up with a game plan for some new meds.  Hopefully these three steps will get me back on the losing track!

      Woo-hoo.  At last -- a day with no meetings and no conference calls.  I'm not sure what to do with all this extra time on my hands!  Yesterday was a different story -- conference call from 9:00 - 9:30, monthly leadership meeting from 10:00 - 3:00, conference call from 10:30 - 11:30, conference call from 11:15 to 12:00, client meeting from 2:00 - 5:00 (which actually ended at 6:45).  Yes, they overlapped, and yes I really needed to be there for all.  There are days when I really wish they would hurry up and clone me.....although I think I would actually use my cloned self for doing something far more fun than conference calls and meetings.  My food has been OK.  I may not be making the best choices but I am staying within my parameters for the most part.  I'm marking it up as successful so far, although the weekends are always a challenge.  I am leaving the office today at 1:00 PM for a "doctor" appointment, which really means I'll go to the gym and then spend the afternoon running errands and doing some stuff around the house.  Oh, yeah, and the surprise of the week.....we have quarterly employee recognition called Star Performer.  At our Leadership Meeting yesterday, my boss honored me with it.  I get a nice plaque and a $50.00 gift check.  Not too shabby.  It totally came out of the blue, and it caught me off guard which is always a nice way to end a hectic day.  Anyway, off to go finish my work.  Hope everyone has a great weekend!   urlLink

      For those of you still getting snow (??), it got to over 105 degrees yesterday in the San Fernando Valley.  It was in the low 90s for me near the coast.  I hope this is not a sign of things to come -- we don't have A/C in the house and rely on open windows, fans and ceiling fans, which usually do the trick.  If it continues to heat up as we get into summer (can you believe it's still spring?), we may have to look at alternate arrangements.  So, Tuesday was on plan and I'm doing well on Wednesday (granted it's only 10:40 AM).  Of course I made the mistake of actually getting on the scale and I am at my highest weight since last year, albeit that only means up 6 pounds.  I'm hoping (praying) that it's only a hangover (no pun intended) from my binge on Sunday.  The funny thing is that I'm not feeling bloated or significantly heavier, so I think that might be a good sign.  Now that I'm feeling like I'm getting the hang of this whole "abstinence" thing, I am planning for my next stage after my successful completion of stage 1.  The one thing I know I am going to have to change is the whole 1 Diet Coke restriction.  I figure as long as I get my water in, having 2 is not going to kill me.  I also know I need to be strict about measuring and weighing my food to make sure I am doing proper portion control.  At some point, this has got to become second nature.  Right?  I am excited about Sunday.  I got tickets to  urlLink Cavalia  which is like Cirque du Soleil on horseback.  I love going to live performances, whether it's theater, concerts, sporting events.  I wish I did more, but it's been really hard with Don's schedule to plan in advance.  Anyway, I used to ride competitively and I grew up around horses, so I'm thinking this is going to be a lot of fun.  I got the "V.I.P." pass which includes parking and a "back stable" pass after the show to see the horses.  When I make out my Christmas list for my parents, my number one wish is a horse.  Still.  After 30 years.  One of these days...  Next item on my agenda for today is to try and figure out what to do for Mother's Day.....Ideas, anyone?

      Good News:  I ate on plan for both Saturday and Sunday Good News:  I went to the gym on Saturday and Sunday (60 minutes of cardio, 75 minutes of lifting)  Bad News:    I drank a bottle and a half of wine on Sunday because I thought I could handle one glass  The sad thing is that I don't even realize what I am doing.  I open the bottle, pour a glass, go about my business and before I know it, the bottle is gone.  I hate the fact that I can be in control when I am out or even at home with Don, but once alone, I lose all awareness and control.  Don and I had a good conversation (as good as you can at 5:30 AM).  I just feel so stupid!!  All that good work for naught.  I had an off day today as well, as I was recovering from the affects of last night.  Of course, one would think that feeling like crap would make me change my ways, but the hangover today seemed worse, probably because I was doing so well and definitely because I had lifted for the first time in a few weeks.  Nothing like feeling sore and nauseous.  Oh, yeah, I have two agents on vacation, one on jury duty and one called in sick, and we were busier than a one-legged man at an ass kicking contest.  I could even hide behind my desk for the day.  This makes it official, I will have to start the mini challenge over.     My Goal:   1.  Eat 3 meals a day:                                  Breakfast:  1 cup of oatmeal, fresh fruit or juice                                  Lunch:  4-6 oz. of lean protein, 1 starch, veggies, optional fruit                                  Dinner:  4-6 oz. of lean protein, 1 starch, veggies, optional fruit  2.  Drink 100 oz. of water a day  3.  1 Diet Coke per day  4.  2 days of exercise per week  5.  No fast food, drive thrus, etc.  6.  Absolutely, positively no alcohol  I would like to keep this up until Tuesday, May 4th.  As  urlLink Denise  said, I will only fail when I give up.

      The most amazing thing happened today.  In front of me was a huge platter of huge pastries and a bowl of strawberries.  I didn't even hesitate -- I made up a plate of 10 strawberries.  A step in the right direction, yes?  One can only hope.  My outlook has gotten a lot better as I realize my new definition of "on plan" is something actually workable.  I've eaten on plan.  It might not be perfect diet food, but I haven't eaten to the point of being stuffed.  I even had a couple of pieces of chocolate and didn't feel guilty or that I had blown the whole day.    Of course, the great weather we are having is helping with my overall mood.  It's bright and sunny and I believe it's supposed to be this gorgeous for the weekend.    Don is working both days, although both shifts are 10 AM to 7 PM, so we'll get to wake up a bit before he has to rush off to work (I'd say sleep in, but Baja's idea of sleeping in is 7:00 AM) and he'll get home before it's fully dark.  No major plans -- I was going to visit my friend with cancer but we're going to go next weekend instead.  Which may mean I might be able to meet up with  urlLink Denise .    Off to actually finish some work.  It's been a very lazy day, although my desk is almost completely clean and I am caught up from my week off -- for the most part.  For anyone watching their snacking, whatever you do, do not come into arm's length of  urlLink these  -- way too addicting.

      OK, now that  urlLink Denise  and  urlLink Yvonne  are taking up the challenge, I thought I might as well.  My goal is to eat on plan everyday until May 1.  That means: Breakfast = oatmeal, fruit Lunch = 4-6 oz. of protein, 1 starch, unlimited veggies, optional fruit Dinner = 6-8 oz. of protein, 1 starch, unlimited veggies Dessert = fruit or 10 cal popsicle  I also have to drink at least 68 oz. of water, limit myself to 1 diet coke per day, and consume no alcohol.  Exercise at this point is optional, but encouraged.  So far, I have 1 day (yesterday) on plan, 9 to go.  Are we ready?

      Back from 5 days of bliss....I won't go back to work until tomorrow, but I'm at home doing chores....  One of the things making this transition a little easier is that it's Dollar Days at Target!!  Woo Hoo!  I got to stock up on some cleaning and bath supplies.  I mean, who is going to run out of toothpaste or Windex?  The bonus was Ralph's (our local Kroeger) was offering 10-for-10 on several items.  I picked up 6 oz. cans of white tuna (in water), shampoo & conditioner and shaving cream.  I couldn't take advantage of all the items, since I don't forsee Don and I eating 10 boxes of ceral or 10 pounds of Roma tomatoes.  I did like saving about $50.00 in groceries, even with all the unpacking and storing.  I'm pretty much ready to go back to work, although one could get used to the relaxing couple of days.  I didn't get all my spring cleaning done, but I will be off the first week in June, so I can get some summer cleaning done instead.  Off to finish my chores for today.  I still have to finish unpacking (everything is out, I just have to put it away) and I should do some laundry....

      ....is the sound you may be hearing as I am in full vacation mode.  The weather is beautiful, the pool is cool....Don and I are in bliss.  I'm not sure how often I'll post between now and Monday as I'm on dial-up and it seems painfully slow.  Guess I'm just spoiled.  The one thing about our location is we get a variety of wildlife.  Last night we saw 3 coyotes crossing the field and today we've seen a lot of quail.  It's nesting season for them, and Baja actually discovered two eggs that must have come out of a nest.  They were both cracked, so we had to toss them, but as I held the eggs in my hands it made me realize how fragile life really is.  We're grilling steaks tonight and having some roasted garlic potatoes and asparagus.  Yum.  I love cooking up here.  I don't know why, but it seems that the food just tastes better.    That's about it for the update.  I'll try to check in at least once more.  If not, hope you all have a great week!

      Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in......  One of the good things about working in a fairly large office is that team leaders cover for each other.  The "rule" has always been, if one leader is out the other leader has to be in the office.  Fair enough.  When the other leader and I scheduled our vacation in December, we sat in a room with the calendar and went back and forth, putting down our time.  She scheduled herself off last week and I picked this week.  At the time, there was no overlap.  Somehow, between December and today, she added a day of vacation to her week -- and the day she added was today, supposedly my first day of vacation.  I called into my voicemail at 8:30 AM since I was waiting for a client to call back and I wanted to forward the voicemail to the other leader to follow up.  When I listened to her voicemail, I noticed she said she would be back on Tuesday.  WTF??!! I thought.  To top it all off, our boss is on vacation so the only leader in the office just took on her responsibilities last week.  And, as an added bonus, one of our accounts we share with NYC was calling in to our office because the NYC travel desk was having "techinical difficulties."    After hemming and hawing, I decided to bite the bullet and come in to the office (out of the goodness of my heart, of course).  It seems like a wise choice -- we have had nothing but issues today -- a blackout at LAX delaying flights, customer service issues left and right, phone problems.  My boss was appreciative, and she knows that the oversight is on the other leader, but it still doesn't make up for the fact that, once again, it's Shannin to the rescue.  And this just in.....the other leader, who is supposed to return into the office tomorrow, actually has a client meeting and she will not be in.  Again, it's a scramble for coverage.  I swear, I am so angry I can't even see straight.  I'm trying to keep it together, but I think the other agents know where I am coming from and sense some of my frustration.  Off to cancel some appointments.  I guess the good news is that I am so angry I'm not hungry.....

      It's slow today in the office, and my desk is all cleaned for vacation, so I've been doing a lot of surfing and decided to do this:  Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, and find line 4. Write down what it says.  …she led her department in production.  She did this in…. (from Fish)  Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?   My ever present jar of lip balm.  What is the last thing you watched on TV?  C.S.I. (repeat, last night)  With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?  Charles making a reservation, Sara discussing client strategy with Darryl, the waterfall from outside.  When did you last step outside?  When I walked from my car into the office building at about 7:58 AM  Before you came to this website, what did you look at?  urlLink  Denise’s  site.   What are you wearing?  Denim shirt, jeans, red slides, my cross earrings, and my Rune necklace.  Did you dream last night?  I dream every night.  When did you last laugh?  When Don called to tell me about Baja “helping” with his workout this morning, including leaping into Don’s stomach while he was doing jumping jacks.  What is on the walls of the room you are in?  Travel posters from JAL, a large world map, bulletin boards with employee photos, memos, etc.  On my cubicle wall, I have 9 photos of the dogs and 5 photos of Don & me, plus some other stuff.  Seen anything weird lately?  One of our employees who is about 6’3” holding another employee’s mini Chihuahua.  What do you think of this quiz?  I’ve seen better, but I’m on vacation count down!  What is the last movie you saw?  ”Identity” on HBO and “The Return of the King” in the theater.  If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?  I don’t know if it would be the first thing, but a house in Montecito, CA.  Tell me something about you that I don't know:  My current favorite cartoon strip is “Get Fuzzy” and my all time favorite is “Calvin and Hobbes.”  If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?  Make sure all abandoned animals are adopted.  Do you like to dance?  I love to dance, even though I’m not very good.  George Bush:  Not my favorite person.  Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?  Isabella Rose  Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?  Aiden Barth  Would you ever consider living abroad?  Yes, yes, yes!!   OK, that wasted like 20 minutes....  Anyway, it looks like my vacation plans are changing slightly.  My dad called and wanted to know if Don and I wanted to use his house in Santa Barbara this week since he is staying "in the city" next weekend.  I'm all for it, so I'm hoping we can swing it by leaving Wednesday after I get my hair cut and staying until Sunday.  Spring cleaning, be damned!  The nice thing about the house is that there is a pool & a Jacuzzi (OK, side note....I went to USC with a guy named Joe Jacuzzi -- his grandfather invented the Jacuzzi tub), a built in BBQ, a firepit (perfect for sitting by while some steaks sizzle on the 'que) and a shower big enough for two (OK, maybe a little too much sharing, but hey, Don and I are dedicated to conserving water when we can!!).    I've already started thinking about what I'm going to bring up, what we'll have for dinner, etc.  It's so relaxing up there.  We usually take it for a week in July to celebrate our anniversary, and I try not to intrude too much, but since Dad isn't using it, why let it go to waste?  Things have really died off here in the office as people make early escaped for the Easter weekend.  I've even been the "nice guy" and let some of the staff off early.  Of course, I don't get to leave early, but I've made some brownie points with the staff and my boss, so I staying an extra 60 minutes won't kill me.  Well, off to kill 118 minutes.....I think my coffee cup needs washing.....

      I love potlucks.  I love being able to taste a lot of foods that I normally wouldn't have.  I love trying my co-worker's cooking or baking.  What I hate about potlucks are the people who say they can't bring anything, or don't want to bring anything and then feel like they can pig out.  We have one woman in our office who never signs up (I'm getting home too late to make anything) but feels free to pile her plate high.  My favorite trick was when we catered lunch for our boss' birthday and she came in with Tupperware not once, but TWICE, before some people even got firsts!  She doesn't report to me, so I can't really say anything, but it really ticks me off.  Hey, I understand not everyone can cook, and I don't always cook -- I've been known to take the easy way out and buy baked goods (but as a leader in the office I do try and bring a main dish -- today it was manicotti) -- but if you're going to eat, plan on bringing something!  Of course, I have my nutritionist appointment tonight at 4:30 PM, so I have to be a little careful about what I'm going to eat.  Anyway, I keep thinking today is Thursday, and every time I realize it's actually Wednesday, I'm disappointed.  Plus, Don just called (he has the day off), telling me he's out on the deck with the dogs.  Grrr....lucky duck.....

      A story from  urlLink News of the Weird :   An 18-year-old man drowned near Eudora, Ark., in December, when the he accidentally fell into a pit of water while attempting to drown his pit bull (which he thought was too old and docile), and the man's father also drowned when he jumped in to save his son. (The dog survived.)    [KATV-TV (Little Rock), 12-9-03]

      Found an interesting link while out surfing today.  If you are interested in what "regular" Iraqi people are thinking, click  urlLink  here .  It is a blog written by a family in Baghdad.  I'm not going to get into how I feel about the war, but I think it's important for us to see how they are living there.    Anyway, not much going on today.  I had the worst craving for a tuna melt today, which I gave in to and now it feels like a huge lump in my stomach.  Don has the day off so we are planning a long walk with the dogs, and hopefully that will help me feel better.  Our office is having a potluck tomorrow and I think I am going to make stuffed manicotti, although I may opt for something like chicken from El Pollo Loco so I don't have to spend the night cooking.  I have to be especially careful at tomorrow's potluck since I have my weigh in at my nutritionist's tomorrow after work.  I will tell you, I have also been craving pizza and the plan is to have some   after   the appointment.  Of course, feeling like I am now after caving to my tuna melt craving, I may re-think that.  Finally, three days, three hours and 37 minutes until I am on vacation.....

      So the bad news is that my mom's friend, Nancy, took a turn for the worse over the weekend.  They actually thought she wasn't going to make it through Saturday night.  In the end, she did make it and she came out of her light coma (whatever that is).  She will be under 24 hour hospice care, at least for the immediate future.  I had a good talk with my Dad about what was going on, and agreed that it would be better for everyone if she just went to sleep and didn't wake up.  I hated hearing myself saying that and I could never say it to my mom.  Not to say I don't believe in miracles, but I have to be honest too.  Anyway, everyone is trying to prepare for the inevitable.  The good news is after I posted on Friday, Don and I had a good talk on Saturday morning.  I know why I'm drinking -- it's to fill up my loneliness when Don isn't at home.  When I look back, I've always been a solitary drinker.  It really started when I was living in NYC.  Even though I was a social butterfly for the most part, any time I didn't have anything to do, I would drink.  Once I moved in with Don, the drinking never really was an issue because we both worked "regular" hours and I really was only alone when he went on business trips (few and far between).    To help remind myself not to drink, I am wearing a silver and turquoise bracelet.  I really wanted to find something similar to the Kabbalah  urlLink Red String , but I had to make due with what I had.  Anyway, I'm hoping it will help me think before drinking (or participating in any other harmful behavior).  I did have some successes over the weekend.  Don and I went to the gym on Saturday and then took the dogs for a 1 1/2 mile walk on Sunday.  We both spent time outside, soaking up some rays and just enjoying the spring weather.  When Don left for work on Sunday, I ran a bunch of errands --  urlLink Linens-N-Things  for pillows,  urlLink Cost Plus  for a few odds and ends (they have great cards and wrapping supplies) and  urlLink Lane Bryant  for two new outfits.  The best part about that was they were having a 20% off everything sale, plus I had a $50 gift card and a $25 gift certificate.  So even though my total was $312.00, I only paid $175.00.  I got two skirts, 3 sweaters and 4 pairs of body shapers, so not too bad.  Of course, I now need shoes......  The best part of the weekend, though, was Friday night when I got a chance to speak to  urlLink Denise .  We spoke for about 2 hours.  It was just so nice to talk to someone who is going through similar situations.  I look forward to more conversations!  It's always fun to speak (or meet) someone you have a certain perception of.  She is very smart, funny, good conversationalist.  You get a great idea of her wit and sense of humor from her writing, but she's even more so over the phone.  Anyway, our conversation gave me a lot to think about and got me started a long the right path!  Anyway, only 4 days, 7 hours and 20 minutes until I start my vacation.....not that I'm counting or anything......

      I really hadn't wanted to write this, but after another night of waking up at 2 AM and hating myself, I figure I am going to have to face the facts.    I have a drinking problem.    I don't seem to have a problem in social settings or even when I'm out to dinner with Don.  I don't even always feel the need to drink when I'm "out on the town."  I do, however, drink almost every night when I am home alone and Don is at work.  It starts with the idea of "just one or two glasses -- just to relax."  It always ends up as almost 2 bottles of wine.  Yep, you read that right -- two bottles of wine.  Of course, drinking encourages other bad choices, namely binging on food.  Trust me, I am not binging on carrots and broccoli either.  So I'm drinking empty calories on top of eating unhealthy food.  Neither is doing my waist line any good.  Besides the actual drinking and eating, the consumption of alcohol gives me heartburn, stomach problems (2 bottles of wine on top of a combo platter from Paco's?  You do the math.), I have to hide the evidence from Don plus I wake up with a sour stomach that only a fried egg sandwich seems to fix.  In other words, one vicious circle.  So, why the confession?  Because it HAS to stop NOW.  I am ruining my health.  I am sabatoging all the good I KNOW I can do.  I am sacraficing my health.  I am wasting major money on alcohol.  I wake up at 3 in the morning (since I passed out at 9 PM) hating myself, kicking myself, wanting to stick my head in the oven and just end the pain of being such a loser.    It pains me to write this.  I hate weakness, and this, to me, is a major character flaw.    Tonight when I get home, the open bottle of wine is getting dumped.  I am going to be strong.  I have to be strong.  This IS stopping NOW.

      So eight years ago today was when I ran into Don for the second time.  As you remember, I had left the Baja Cantina with Don's  wrong  number.  I didn't really think much about it, I mean, how many times had I given the wrong number to a member of the opposite sex?  Anyway, in the two weeks between meetings, I had actually met Marty, an accountant from my friend, Kristi's, work.  Since I don't believe in blind dates, Kristi decided that for Marty and I to get to know one another, a group should go out for cocktails.  I decided to go for the "sort of slutty" look.  I was wearing cowboy boots, jeans and a black velvet bodysuit with a scoop neck and a pushup bra to show off my cleavage (I was much skinnier).  About 8 of us met up at Pier View, a local bar.  One of the promotions Pier View was having that night was the  urlLink Jagermeister  Girls, who were there passing out coupons for shots, hats, temporary tatoos, etc.  Of course, many of our group grabbed some free swag.  Kristi and I went in to the restroom and applied the tatoos -- she put them on her arm, and I put one on each breast.  You couldn't see them unless I showed them off, but I thought it was sexy (hey, I had 2 shots of Jagermeister!!).  The group thought Pier View was dead so we headed over to the Baja Cantina.  As soon as I walked in, I saw Don standing at the bar.  The rest of the gang headed to the back to get a table, and Kristi and I decided to say hi to Don.  He smiled as we approached and said he remembered us.  He offered to buy us a drink, which we accepted.  Kristi headed back to the rest of our party while I stayed to talk to Don for a few minutes.  I was flirting with him and said, out of the blue, "Do you want to see my tatoos?" and before waiting for an answer, I pulled down my top a bit to show off my Jagermeister tatoos.  He said, "Yes, I do."  We stayed at the bar for about another 30 minutes and then we went to his place, which was walking distance from the bar.  I went back to say good byes to Kristi and the rest of the gang, much to buzzed to remember about poor Marty.  Kristi told me later she made the excuse that Don and I were old friends.    I stayed the night at Don's, and we've been together ever since.  I broke all my "rules:"  -No dating anyone from the Baja -Five date minimum -No one night stands -At least know his last name  Despite going against everything I though was right, we have had 8 wonderful years together.  I guess this only goes to show you, you never know when you are going to fall in love or with whom.  I would have never guessed I would find my perfect partner in a bar.  I also never guessed I would have ever found a perfect partner.  But, Don is just that.    Don, if you're reading, thank you, honey, for the best eight years of my life.

      I started my 7 day cleanse today.  So far, it's all good.  Of course, the one thing I noticed is how many images there are of food at every step of the way.  I mean, I'm watching TLC's "Faking It" and it's sponsored by Digiorno frozen pizza.  I haven't had any serious hunger pains, although I'm really only 8 hours in to it.  I did manage to do 45 minutes on the treadmill.  I know it's going to get harder before it gets easier, but I'm going to do my hardest to get through the next week.  Most of today was spent out on the deck reading, but I do have some cleaning to try and get done today -- the bathrooms.  Mostly, it's cleaning out old cosmetics since my bathrooms are pretty clean already.  I always feel better when I get it done, though.  That's about it from here for now.  Hardly exciting, but I guess you don't want too much excitement when you are only drinking water and lemon juice.

      I am really looking forward to next week.  I have a huge to do list, but I know I can get it all done.  Certain tasks are going to make me take on other tasks -- like getting my carpets cleaned.  That means, to get ready I have to clean off and move nightstands, my shoe rack, clean behind my bedroom TV stand, etc.  My biggest task is getting my office organized.  That has really become my "junk" room where everything goes until I figure out what to do with it.  Needless to say, there are stacks of things on the floor, on the bookshelves, on the filing cabinets, on the desk.    On top of getting my house cleaned, I have decided to do a "cleanse" with the supervision of my nutritionist.  Starting Sunday for 7 days, my entire diet will be the following:   12 ounces of water mixed with 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, 1 pinch of cayanne pepper.  Drink 6 - 7 times a day.  Unlimited water.   Yep, that's it.  I'm also encouraged to do cardio 4 times a week and use a dry sauna a few times to sweat out the toxins.  I know it sounds pretty extreme, but I've done a similar one before and, after the first 2 - 3 days, it's actually a piece of cake.  It really does help you clean out your system, and you do feel more energetic and focused.  I think this might be the jump start I need in the weight loss department.  Although the primary goal of a cleanse is not to lose weight, it's often an added benefit.  Anyway, we'll see how it goes.  Off to wrap up my 4th conference call of the day (I've been on a call since 9:00 AM and it's now 12:15 PM).  Once again, so much to do and so little time.

      The last few days have just been jam-packed.  I've been so burnt out when I get home at night that the last thing I want to do it log on to the 'Net.  Anyway, I weigh in at my nutritionist in 45 minutes.  Is there any way to lose  5 - 6 pounds in that amount of time?  I thought not.  Ahhh, well.....  I'm still waiting on my test results from my doctor's appointment last week.  I'm hoping they are good, but I'm worried about my thyroid.  I'm tired of dealing with it and just want to stop medicating it since it doesn't seem to be making a difference.  I'm feeling bloated and dehydrated because of the allergy meds I'm taking, so basically I'm just all messed up.  Of course, the best remedy to all of this is to go on vacation, which I am doing next week. I plan on getting a lot of stuff done around the house -- things like getting the carpets cleaned, the chimney swept, getting a quote on replacing our front face, etc.  Plus I have a huge list of spring cleaning chores.  Despite this sounding like work, there is something very rejuvenate about "getting your house in order."  There is still upheaval at work.  My boss has a job, but I don't know if she is going to continue to be my boss.  There is also a rumor that a new position is coming out that is more up my alley -- Business Analyst.  Now that is something to get excited about.

      Yes, I'm still here....it's just been a bitch of a week with a lot going on.   Shrek 2  was great.  I don't want to set anyone's expectations, but I thought it was better than the first.  Enough said -- just go see it if you have a chance.  One of the things that has been weighing on my mind is the reorganization  we are going through at work.  They started at the top and are working their way down as they intergrate other people and positions.  My boss should hear something before the end of the month and then 2 weeks later, my level should hear something.  The first step was taken this week -- two positions at my level have been eliminated.  One was a field team leader and my boss just moved her into the open position in our office.  It's not a bad move since we work well together, but I had hoped to take on more and that didn't happen.  In the end only one person got laid off and since she has been with the company for 19 years, she gets 52 weeks pf severance.  Not too shabby.  There is still a lot of tension and unanswered questions.  I'm not going to worry about it too much -- at least not out loud.  My program has not been going very well.  I've not eaten "on plan" like I had hoped -- sometimes less, often more.  I haven't been to the gym in a week, and I'm really feeling that, so a trip is on the agenda for today.  The sad thing is I know how successful I can be if I just followed the plan.

      Don was able to get tickets for the 6:20 showing of Shrek 2, so I'm really excited. We'll probably pick up a quick bite to eat as well, making this an "official" date.  With our work schedules being so crazy, we haven't really gotten to spend any time together -- other than crashing on the couch -- so this will be a nice change in pace.  With little else to say, I will take a page from  urlLink Denise :  Go to  urlLink Google  and type your name into the search box.  What do  YOU  come up with?  The first hit is actually this web site.  Interesting.  Shannin Schroeder is an Assistant Professor of English and Foreign Languages Shannin Chamberlain is 10 and has cancer (hopefully not an omen) Shannin Strom owns Red Buckle Shoe Handbags Shannin Watkins has her minutes posted  Hardly exciting.....

      I know I left you with a bit of a cliffhanger, but, hey I was on pins and needles too for two weeks!  OK, I wasn't really, but I did find it odd since we had such a good conversation and he seemed to really enjoy my company.   I told him that I posted about our first meeting and he was demanding equal time.  Maybe I can convince him to be a guest blogger for a day.  What I'm really excited about is  urlLink  Shrek 2   is opening tomorrow!  I think Don and I are going to try and get into the 6:20 PM show.  Normally, I don't like going on opening night, but I don't want to hear too much about the movie before seeing it.  The other bit of news is that  urlLink Cold Stone Creamery  is opening about 1 1/2 blocks from our house.  I've actually only had it once, and it was  wonderful .  I knew I had to stay away.  The good news, at the time, was that the only one open in Los Angeles was not very close, so it wasn't much of a temptation.  Now that it's going to be right around the corner, it's a totally different story.  Well, as Don said, "Hey, we could walk over here with the dogs."  Ummmm....there's some justification.  I also went to my doctor's today.  Nothing earth shaking except she reminded me that I haven't had a Pap smear in a year and a half.  Oopps.  My blood pressure was a little high, but I think that's partly because I've been forgetting to take my medication at night.  I should have my blood work by next week. The best part was that her scale was 3 pounds lower than my scale at home!  Usually it's the other way around.  Even though I know what my "real" weight is, it was nice to see the lower numbers.  My success story of the day, if you could call it that, was after fasting for the blood work, I was somewhat hungry.  I stopped by El Pollo Loco and picked up a salad and ate it as soon as I got to work.  A vendor was in with pastries and fruit.  I went in and looked, but realized I was really too full to eat anything right then, although a juice is sounding good right about now.  Bottom line, I'm starting to listen to my body and I hope that means I'm making progress.  Off to finish out the day.  We were really busy yesterday.  I took 109 calls, not including calls coming in on my personal line -- which is about 109 more than I should take.  Granted, I took call back messages for about 75% of them but I got roped into doing about 25 reservations and that meant I got nothing else done.  Today was catch up day, and I'm feeling like I have it mostly under control.  Famous last words, I know....

      Eight years ago today, I met Don for the first time.  I was at the  urlLink Baja Cantina  with my friend, Kristi.  It was a Friday night, and a typical Baja crowd.  As we were cruising the bar, a nice looking man was heading our way.  Kristi, not the shy one, started to tease him about wearing a tie to the Baja Cantina on a Friday night.  With the crush of people, we couldn't really move, so we started talking and discovered that we actually had a lot in common.  I was working on the Fox Studio lot, Don was working up the street at  urlLink Fox Sports  and Kristi was in his same building working for  urlLink Freeman Cosmetics .  I am a huge sports fan and Don was working in the Research Department for the Fox Sports Network (at the time we met, it was still Prime Sports, but Fox had just recently purchased them).  Prior to that, he covered the Los Angeles Rams for the  urlLink Orange County Register .  Being a football buff, I was intrigued.  Kristi was not a sports fan and she was soon bored by the conversation and went off looking for someone to buy her free drinks.  Don and I talked for probably an hour or so.  Kristi soon decided she wanted to leave, and since we drove together, I had to leave as well.  She prodded Don into exchanging phone numbers with me, which we did.  It wasn't until I was in the car that I realized he had given me a wrong number.  Since I did travel for people in his building, I knew the prefix was  399  not  339  like he gave me.  I figured, "Oh, well," and decided that the napkin with his number would join others on the "Boys' Board" hanging in my kitchen (a collection of numbers, business cards, and other such stuff one collects when one is single and bar hopping).  The story continues on May 31 --  The Meeting That Changed My Life, Part 2 .

      This week seems like it's dragged on forever.  I know part of that is because of not really having any time to relax last weekend.  I am really looking forward to tomorrow.  We won't get to sleep in because Baja's stomach goes off exactly at 7:00 AM, but we won't have to rush off anywhere.  I do know we are going to go to the gym and the dog park, but the rest of the day will be spent hanging in the back yard with the dogs.  In lieu of actually doing any work this afternoon, I lifted this from  urlLink Danelle:    WRATH     Who did you last get angry with?  The guy at work who I know is stealing stuff off others’ desks.   What is your weapon of choice?  My silence first and then my words.    Who was the last person that got really angry at you?  Probably one of my employees when I had to give them feedback on their tardiness.   What is your pet peeve?  People who park their SUVs in compact parking spots, for one.  For the rest see  urlLink  here .   Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily?  I don’t think I keep grudges, although I tend to remember perceived slights or injustices.   SLOTH    What is one thing you're supposed to do daily that you haven't done in a long time?  Wash my face and brush my teeth before bed.   What is the latest you've ever woken up?

I’ve been meaning to write my friend, Sally, in England.   What is the last lame excuse you've made?  "I’m on a conference call."    Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through?  Oh, yeah.   When was the last time you got a good workout in?  About 2 weeks ago.   How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today?  None.  For one thing, Baja makes sure we’re up by 7:00 AM.  Also, my clock doesn’t have a snooze button.    GLUTTONY     What is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice?  I don’t know if this is “yuppie,” but I only drink microbrews or imported beer.   White meat or dark meat?  Dark.   What is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event?  I don’t know the exact amount, but enough Jagermeister to still be drunk when I got up the next morning for work.   Have you ever used a professional diet company?  Yep – I see a nutritionist.   Do you have an issue with your weight?  Yes –both emotionally and physically.  But I am working on it.   Do you prefer sweets, salty foods, or spicy foods?  Spicy!   Have you ever taken food "to go" from a buffet?  Ahhh….no.     LUST     How many people have you seen naked (not counting movies/family)?  I couldn’t even begin to guess.     How many people have seen YOU naked (not counting physicians/family)?  See above.   Have you ever caught yourself staring at the chest/crotch of a member of your gender of choice during a normal conversation?  Only if it’s drawing attention to itself.     Have you wanted someone who was taken?  Yes.   What is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice?  Chest and eyes.   Have you ever been propositioned by a prostitute?  No.   Have you ever had a one night stand?  Yes.   GREED     How many credit cards do you own?  Three AMEX (1 of which is a corporate card), 1 Visa, 1 Sears and 1 Home Depot.  The only one with a balance is the Visa.   What's your guilty pleasure?  “The Young and the Restless”   If you had $1 million, what would you do with it?  Remodel our house, pay off the Visa and invest the rest.   Would you rather be rich or famous?  Rich.  Heck, I’d be happy with just financially secure.   Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks?  Not if it was long term.     Have you ever stolen anything?  Couldn’t we just call it “permanently borrowing”?    How many mp3's are on your hard drive?  About 50   PRIDE     What's one thing you have done that you're most proud of?  Adopted Jager, because she might not have had a chance otherwise.

      OK, I didn't really have Hot Tamales  AND  hash browns....just the Hot Tamales.  Something happened late in the day yesterday and I didn't really want to deal with it.  One of my employees let me know that two items had been taken off his desk.  This is the fourth time items have been missing.  Being in the travel industry, we get a lot of swag or take away items -- things like model planes, rubber ducks, pens, stress balls, travel candles, mints, etc.  We all have shitloads of them on our desks.  I know it's one of the other employees who has a beef with my guy, but I can't prove it.  I mean, I am the youngest one in the office and sometimes I feel like I'm the most mature.  Are we in business or in kindergarten?  Anyway, I was still upset this morning that I have so much on my plate right now (usually not a problem, because I just eat it....LOL) that I really do not have the time to waste on petty crap like this.  Calgon, take me away....  I did crank at work today.  Got out 30 UPS packs to help our employees celebrate Wear   Purple   for Peace on Monday.  I sent out information on peace, tolerance and diversity on purple paper (natch) and included little plastic peace signs.  We try and do something around diversity each month, and I'm on both the local and the regional diversity team.  The only thing I didn't get done and that I  have  to do tomorrow is my expense report.  I rarely have expenses, but it's a somewhat laborious process so I tend to put it off until the last minute.  Tomorrow is the drop dead date, otherwise I'm "reported" to the GM of our group.  I'll be watching the last "Frazier" tonight.  I kinda stopped watching about 2 seasons ago, but was drawn back in for this one.  It's kind of like "Friends;" I was there at the beginning and I want to be there for the end.  Weird, I know.  Off to do my final task for the day -- pricing for some groups traveling from 9 international cities to either Atlanta or Miami.

      Man, when it rains, it pours....one agent out for 3 weeks on jury duty (funny aside: she has been saying for weeks she wanted to get on a case.  When she reported, she found out that it was for murder by decapitation.  She has a weak stomach and wanted to get off the case, but the judge wouldn't excuse her. Moral: Be careful for what you wish for!), one agent leaving for vacation, one agent retiring (no replacement as of yet), two agents getting displaced.  There are times like this where I really wonder why I am in management.  I hate giving bad news, I hate dealing with staffing problems.  I prefer looking at big picture stuff and doing presentations, reports, etc.  Oh, well.  It pays the bills, even if I have to lose sleep over it.  I'm also dreading my nutritionist appointment this afternoon.  I know I'm going to be up and it just kills me that I'm paying a professional to tell me exactly what to eat and I don't do it.  Why not just toss the money out the window?  To top my wonderful day off, I have a big trade show tonight that I need to go to.  I've skipped out the last 2 years, but our company has two booths and, as a leader, I should go.  I don't like crowds, and travel agents are notoriously greedy.  My mom would call them "grabinskis."  Anything free is fair game and one is never enough ("I have to get some for the office.")  Geeze, it's just pens and post-it notes.  I did take the time to put up a profile which includes a photo of me.  It's from last summer and I don't always wear glasses, but it's pretty decent.  I'm also going to try and post a photo here as I try out a new service:     Off to play some more as I wrap up conference calls....

      So the plan was to get up at 5:30 AM to hit the gym.  Instead, I hit the snooze button.  I think a big part of it is that I haven't been sleeping well over the last week, mostly due to thinking about Nancy's service, life, death , etc.  My M.O. was to wake up at 3:00 AM for a bathroom run and then not fall back to sleep.  Anyway, I slept, and slept HARD I might add, until 7:15 AM.  I can't tell you the last time I was still in bed at 7:15 AM much less asleep.  I get off at 6:00 PM tonight, so maybe I'll try and do a tape instead so at least I can make my goal for the month.  As you can see, I updated my blog look.  Blogger has some new templates.  For some reason, though, my comments keep falling out.  Sometimes they're there, sometimes they are not.  Bear with me as I continue to learn about the ins and outs of blog design.

      What an exhausting weekend.  Between the emotional drain of the service on Saturday and the anticipation of Mother's Day brunch on Sunday, I was pretty much a wreak from Friday until Sunday afternoon.  In the end, it was no where near as bad as I thought it might.  Nancy's service was hard emotionally, but equally gratifying.  The speeches (including my mom's) were great -- a lot of laughs and a few tears.  Everyone who spoke touched on something we all remembered about Nancy -- her laugh, her smile, her tendency to yell/scream in excitement, her love of children (she taught Nursery School for 18 years), her predilection for sipping chardonnay, her love of the beach.  Her youngest son did a beautiful Power Point presentation with a ton of photos with music.  My mom also did a photo board which included a photo of Nancy, her daughter Jackie, my mom and me on my 16th birthday -- talk about memories -- Mom and Nancy rented a limo and we went to see the Eurythmics.  I was dressed in white pants, a red vest and a white "Miami Vice" blazer PLUS white Ray Bans.  Jackie was "Contempo'd" (if you ever went to a mall in the 80s, you probably know Contempo) in her red, black and white outfit.  Jeeze, some photos should just stay in storage.  Anyway, we didn't stay at the reception very long -- too many people, too hot and I always find people grubbing for free food somewhat disturbing.  I was worried that Mother's Day brunch would be overly emotional with my mom still grieving, however we had a wonderful time and really good food.  Because of all the worrying and running around, I never really felt like I got to relax until late last night, and I crashed at 9:30 PM.  In fact, I was really dragging ass this morning and kinda feel like I didn't get a "real" weekend.  On top of it all, it's THAT time of the month, so I know that's taking it's toll as well.  I'm doing well on my May goals.  I even made a smart choice at Starbuck's yesterday -- non-fat iced coffee.  I didn't do too well at brunch, opting for huevos ranchero over grilled ahi tuna, but I can't win them all.  I did do a 40 minute walk with the dogs on Saturday, but did not get to do any exercise yesterday, so only 50% on the exercise goal.  Ahh, well, it's still early in the month.  I have a fairly busy week -- no rest for the weary I guess.  Can't wait for the weekend, that's for sure.

      Don and I bought our house August 2001, so for those slow at math, we have been living in our abode for 2 years and 8 months.    For that entire time, our big front window has not had curtains, blinds or shutters.  It's a double-wide window and looks out over our front yard and the street.  At night, when we're in the living room, we're clearly visible by people walking along the street.  It hasn't really bothered me much, but I think that's because I had gotten used to it.  We had discussed getting some type of window coverings, but just kept putting it off.  Well, we  finally  got off our collective asses and went to 3 Day Blinds.  We now have proper window coverings!  They actually look very nice in the room and it does make a difference, not only from a privacy point, but the window faces west so it's a nice sun blocker as well.  The added bonus was supposed to be to block the view of Baja and Jager so they didn't bark at every single 4-legged creature that meanders by their "kingdom."  unfortunately, Jager seems to have a sixth sense, and she can still tell when other creatures are crossing her turf. (My first clue should have been while we were in Santa Barbara, Jager was asleep, and woke up to bark at 3 coyotes crossing the field.)  Anyway, this has gotten me to think about goals for the month, and how they shouldn't just be about food and exercise since when I have a clean and organized house, the rest of my life seems to become clean and organized.  So, drumroll please.....   Goals for May   1. Eat according to plan set forth by Nutritionist Phil 2. Exercise on Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday 3. Purchase/install front blinds  DONE  4. Week of Spring Cleaning (week of 5/29 - 6/6) 5. Drink 100 oz. of water per day 6. No drinking alcohol alone 7. Attend at least one social event 8. Reach out to friends at least once a week 9. Take time to read at least 30 minutes per day 10. No eating out of the vending machines 11. No fast food (exception: El Pollo Loco)  I use a Franklin Planner, and have for about 5 years.  One of the teachings is to fill out a Weekly Compass so you have your bearings for the week.  You should do something Physical, Social/Emotional, Mental and Spiritual each week.  On top of that, any roles you have defined for yourself (for me I am: WIFE, LEADER, "MOM")  you should list weekly goals to help you with those roles.  I haven't been using this effectively, and would like to start using it as a tool.  When I looked at my goals for this month, I tried to incorporate some of those.    I'm pretty excited about these goals, and think that they are really achievable.  I've been organized before, I know I can do it again....

      One thing I noticed when Nancy died is how different grieving is, not only how people grieve differently, but how the actual death affects grieving.  When my mom called and told me Nancy died, my heart felt heavy and there was a profound sadness -- for someone who has died so young (55) and for her family.  There was no sobbing or wailing or the thinking that life isn't fair.  I'm sure part of that is because we have been preparing for her death for some time now, so when she did finally go, we had, for the most part, worked through all the steps in grieving.  On the other end, when someone is taken from you suddenly, without warning, the grieving is completely different.  When I learned my friend, Shoba, died in a plane crash, I felt like I was socked in the stomach.  When I learned my aunt, Patricia, was in the first tower on the floor where the plane went in on 9/11, I physically ached.  To this day, when the news shows a clip of the burning towers or the towers coming down, I have to look away.  I learned of Shoba's death on St. Patrick's Day, and every year I get a little emotional.    Anyway, I just find how people deal with death interesting.  Mark, Nancy's husband of 30+ years, was fretting over how he was never going to be able to sell the house (in California, you have to disclose if there has been a death in the house).  I mean, his wife has been dead for less than 12 hours and he's worried about the house!  I know this is just his own way of dealing with the immense pain he must be feeling.  Her youngest son, Ben, pretty much slept through the day as his way of dealing with the aftermath.    So, we're all muddling through it.  As I said, Saturday is going to be tough, and I know Sunday will be an emotional Mother's Day for me and my mom.  So far, I'm getting through this without relying on alcohol, although I'm sure I will have 1 or 2 margaritas in honor of Cinco de Mayo tonight (with Don, so not alone!).  I'll post tomorrow my new goals for May.  I did OK on my mini challenge, although, once again, I was not able to not drink alone (although I did go 6 days between drinks).  I have some good ideas for my new plan and goals and think that they should be attainable.  Thanks for everyone's support.  It's greatly appreciated!

      My friend, Nancy, has passed away.  I was able to go see her Saturday morning with my mom.  The only reason why I knew it was Nancy was because she was in Nancy’s house, in Nancy’s bed.  If she had been lying in a hospital, I would not have recognized her.  She had changed so much since I last saw her.  She was skin and bones.  I don’t think she knew I was there, at least not consciously.  My mom thought she did, but I figured it was easier to agree than to disagree with her.    Nancy had told my mom a few weeks ago that she wanted to make it to her next birthday.  Her birthday was Sunday, and she passed a little after midnight.  I am going to miss her.  She was always like a second mother to me.  When I was  there on Saturday, it amazed me how little things had changed at her house – the same books on the bookshelves, the same photos.  Nancy had the most infectious laughter.  When we’d be out and Nancy would laugh, everyone would turn to see what the commotion was about.  It was an honest, devil may care laugh – and she laughed right up until the last.    Nancy did everything grand.  I remember singing top 40 hits at the top of our lungs while we tooled down the highway towards the beach in her VW van (remember, this was the 70s and the van was “hip.”).  As kids, we used to play freeze tag or T.V. tag on her front lawn while she and my mom sipped chardonnay and sat on the front step.  We would watch “I Love Lucy” and “Bewitched” reruns while eating celery and peanut butter – sitting on the living room floor because our swimsuits were still damp.  Nancy would sing along with us as we used the swing set to “fly” and be the Bug-a-loos (The Bug-a-loos, The Bug-a-loos, we’re in the air and everywhere, flying high, flying free, flying free as the summer breeze…..).  Every May, Nancy would wax nostalgic about growing up in Kentucky, and she would watch the Derby and sing “My Old Kentucky Home.”  She worked at a nursery school because she was a kid at heart.  These are just a few of the things I will remember about Nancy.  She fought hard against her cancer; she never gave up.  I know this means she is no longer in pain, that she doesn’t have to fight anymore.  She can rest in peace.  I’m sorry to see her go, and her laugher quieted.  Nancy, thank you for teaching me how to live my own life out loud.  I’ll try and do you proud.  I love you.

      Sorry I've been inactive the last few days.  An old shoulder injury raised its ugly head over the weekend, causing a great amount of pain.  It got so bad on Sunday night that I only got 4 hours of sleep.  Luckily, I have an awesome chiropractor and he was able to get it back into place yesterday. I'm still sore from the deep muscle manipulation he had to do (feels like the pec and trap muscles should be black and blue), but I can raise my are above my head, and actually do things like type, wash my hair, etc.  While this has been going on, my motivation has decided to take a mini-vacation.  I haven't been to the gym in about 10 days, and the scale is showing it.  I've also not been on plan, although I've been back on it since Monday.  I probably won't get into the gym today, but I'm hoping to do a 2 1/2 mile walk when I get home.  I'm curious how long it will take me and if I can do this route before I go to work.  I spent most of the weekend catching up on my reading.  I love to read, and will read almost anything.  I usually have a stack of books that I need to read, because there is nothing worse than wanting to read and  not  having anything to read -- although that's usually not an issue because I never part with a book, so I can always re-read something.  This weekend I read  urlLink Veronika Decides to Die ,  urlLink The Drift  and  urlLink Practical Demonkeeping .  Talk about 3 different books!  All were pretty short -- under 250 pages.  I would recommend them all, although you need a pretty twisted sense of humor to read "Practical Demonkeeping" by Christopher Moore.  He is one author that can make me laugh out loud.  After today, I will have 15 days before my week in Santa Barbara!  I am so excited.  I'm actually only working part day on Friday, July 16 so I can use the rest of the day to pack and run errands.  I've also arranged it that I will only be working part day on Monday, July 26.  I've found that after a week off, it takes me about 3 hours just to slog through the e-mails.  This way, I can come in when I get up on Monday, work my e-mails and go home to do laundry and finish unpacking.    After a nice, sunny weekend, we're back to June gloom.  I can only hope that with the start of July, we'll start feeling like it's summer.

      It seems like life has just been work, work and more work.  I guess the good news is that the new leader in the office and I are enjoying a wonderful honeymoon where we seem to be in step and working as a team.  That's so different that it has been, so that is a great change.  I can also tell my boss is busy trying to make sure I have a lot on my plate so anyone who is looking to do more reorganization will have to think, "We can't live without Shannin!"  That's a little stressful -- two groups (one 60 and one 150 people), several projects, a lot of tasks around the office to help my new counterpart get acclimated, etc.    At least the sun is actually trying to make an appearance before 3:00 PM.  I'm really hoping for a nice 4th of July weekend.  Don will actually have Saturday and Sunday off (woo-hoo, two days in a row) and I really want it to be sunny so we can get some deck time together.  Of course, what I am really waiting for is July 16 -- the start of my vacation.  Here's a funny thing.  I just called Don to check in with him and I could hear the dog's barking in the background because the mail was coming.  Don says to the dogs, "Hey, stop barking!  I'm on the phone."  Like the dogs know what a phone is.  So, I'm laughing, and Don says to me, "It's important you talk to them, even if they don't know what you're saying."  I use that philosophy with my staff sometimes.  I'm meeting with my nutritionist after work.  My current food plan is just not working.  It's very discouraging to eat nothing but a salad all day and still gain weight.  It seems like a plan will work for a week or two and then my body adjusts and it stops working.  This is kind of what happened when I tried Atkins.  My fantasy has become winning enough money to hire a full-time chef and personal trainers (weight coach, yoga instructor, etc.).  Nothing wrong with dreaming....  On a side note, Dean, my dad's partner of 14 years, had two of his songs recognized on the  urlLink AFI's List of 100 Best Movie Songs .  He had "Footloose" at #96 and "Fame" at #51.  I only caught the last 45 minutes of the show last night, but I love any type of list.  I can't really disagree with "Over the Rainbow" as #1, although the #2 song, "As Time Goes By" is one of my all-time personal favorites.  We've kind of been debating the list all morning, and several people have weighed in with their own favorite.  It keeps the day moving....

      I'm not sure if it's because it's Monday or if the weather has anything to do with it, but I wish I was curled up on my couch with a good book.  It's definitely June Gloom here in Southern California.  Lately, we don't even get to see the sun until late afternoon.  Normally I wouldn't say the weather affects my emotions, but I think because overcast skies this time of year are so unexpected.  I mean, it's the first day of summer for goodness sake.  Where is the sun??  I guess the one good thing about the gloom is instead of lounging on a beach chair all of Saturday, Don and I did some much needed yard work.  We only tackled the back yard, but we had to leave the front for another weekend as our trimmings can was full to the brim with deadheaded roses and cut jasmine vines.  I love the look of a well-tended garden, I just don't have the patience to weed and trim to maintain one.  Our yard is going for the "natural" look.    Don and I did have a wonderful dinner at  urlLink McCormick & Schmick's  to celebrate Father's Day.  I had tilapia encrusted with cashews and a rum butter sauce.  It was so good.  I didn't eat much of the rice (only about 1/4 of what was served), but I probably could have skipped the cup of soup and even dessert.  I ended up feeling stuffed, something I hadn't felt for a very long time.  I did well at dinner last night with my Dad.  We ordered Thai food in and I was totally on plan -- even with the portions.  Anyway, off to finish out my day.  I am getting my toes & nails done this afternoon -- maybe that will add some sunshine into my life!

      With nothing exiting to report, I've decided to make today's post a bit of a humorous story about Baja & Jager.  We have an enclosed dog run behind our garage where we usually leave the dogs when we are at work.  At the time, both Don and I worked close enough to home to come home for lunch and let the dogs out of their run for a bit of a romp.  It was my turn, and everything seem pretty normal -- Jager shot out of the run, but Baja was just sitting in the back.  I noticed something dangling from his mouth.  I called him out and discovered that they were Jager's tags from her collar.  I called Jager over to get her collar off so I could reattach the tags, and, with a sinking feeling in my stomach, realized she didn't have her collar on.  I searched high and low in the run, lifting up the Dog-gloo, the water dish, etc.  I came up with part of the plastic buckle and about 1/2 inch of nylon collar.  I called Don, and he rushed home so we could take the dogs to the vet.  We figured that Baja, during one of their wrestling matches, had gotten Jager's collar off.  They took X-rays and saw some of the plastic in Baja's digestive tract.  Nylon wouldn't show up, so we had to give each of them a high fiber diet (yummy) and poke through their poop to recover as much of the collar as we could.  Most of it did come out of Baja with a little of it out of Jager. We ended up recovering 23 inches out of 24.  To this day, the vet staff recognizes us as the parents of the dog who ate the collar.  In the end, it wasn't too horrible.  I was more worried that we would have to open him up (I watch too much   urlLink Emergency Vets ) and I was not ready for that.  I can laugh about it now, but that sick feeling I got when I first realized Jager didn't have her collar on is not one I want to repeat. (Although I almost did this weekend -- Don had said he left his beach towel on the chair outside, and I had seen it earlier, but when I went to bring it inside it was gone -- and I immediately thought, "Oh, God, the dogs at the towel!"  Actually, Don had brought it inside.)  So, for all of those who have pets or kids who do silly things, this one's for you!

      I have learned how to beat temptation!  Just keep your house bare of food.  Worked for me last night.  Seriously, I really wanted to binge, but I had no "binge" food in the house.  Sure, I could pig out on all the fresh fruit and veggies I wanted, but where is the fun in that?  I think, more than ever, it became clear last night that a lot of my snacking is out of boredom.  I can see why people smoke -- it's just something to do.  I was also tempted this morning to cram more unhealthy food down my throat when my world fell apart at 8:20.  I knew that we were going to have 3 people out today -- one had a grandson graduating, two had a son graduating.  Also, one was going to leave for about 2 1/2 hours to watch her niece perform in a play.  We have 1 person out on vacation and 1 person covering for her.  Needless to say, we were already running pretty lean and mean.  And then..... 2  people called out sick.  These two knew that we were already down several people, and despite that, they called in "not feeling well."  That kind of crap really ticks me off.  I know I've called in sick when I could have gone in, but I also do it when I know we are fully staffed.  I would have to be on my death bed to call in sick when I was fully aware of other people out.  Grrrrrrrr.....  To add more grief......due to a paperwork error (not on my part), we are going to have to write off close to $125,000.00.  We can eventually recover it, but it's still going to go down as a write off and then the paperwork to recover it is a pain.  I actually have 9 minutes to get something in writing from the vendor to avoid this, but it's dicey that I'll actually get it in time.  And, yes, this could have been prevented if my suggestion had been taken back in September.  Ahhh, well....Incompetence at the highest levels really only affects those of us at the bottom.  Despite all of this drama, I have stuck to the plan.  My only variance has been a cup of coffee this morning, but I took it black with no cream or Equal.  Since I'm not restricting caffeine, I figured this would be OK.  I just have to be strong to get through the day.....

      We had a nice and quiet weekend.  Got the house cleaned and some bouganvilla planted in the back yard.  We BBQ'd last night, and I overate but I was on plan the rest of the weekend, so I'm not feeling  that  bad.  I only got one day of exercise in.  For some reason, I just couldn't get motivated yesterday.  It was such a nice day out, I just wanted to hang out on the deck with the dogs and Don and get some reading done.  Every once in awhile, I think it's probably OK to spend the day completely relaxing.  This week should be pretty mellow as well.  I only have a few conference calls and it seems like my meeting demands have diminished -- probably because the "upper levels" of management are still working on the whole reorganization.  This actually gives me a chance to get some older tasks off my To Do list.  Plus, because of scheduling, I will actually be working 9 AM - 6 PM all week and I can get a good long walk in before I come into the office.  Plus, I'm in countdown mode to our Santa Barbara vacation -- 5 weeks.  The thing I want to accomplish this week is cleaning out the clutter in my bathrooms and linen closet.   urlLink FlyLady  is having a Super Fling.  For those with clutter, this gives you some great motivation to tackle at least part of your house.  Tonight, I'm going to do the small bathroom, which should be a breeze.  Tomorrow will be the big bathroom and might take a day or two....  So far, I'm on plan for the day.  I'm feeling good and energized and ready to take on the week!

      Thanks to  urlLink Furry Friday  for these questions:  Pet Disasters!  1: What's the worst pet you've ever had? What earned it that title?  I never really had a bad pet.  I would have to say fish -- I wanted a dog and my parents got us a fish tank.  Like you can teach Nemo to fetch....   2: What's the worst thing one of your pets has ever done?  Baja ate Jager's collar and we had to give him a high fiber diet and sift through his poop to make sure all the piece passed.   3: My personal worst pet experience was a Rottweiler puppy with an appetite for everything!! In honor of her use the letters: B-R-O-W-N-I-E (her name) to describe a pet of yours!  B rave  R ambunctious  O utgoing  W arm-hearted  N eedy  I ndividual  E xpert

      I am going to have to show Don how to use the digital camera so I can actually get in some of these photos.....  Baja telling Don it's time to play.....     Baja looking playful....     Jager being daring (this was taken in Santa Barbara in April)....     Jager sunning herself in her fort....     As you can see, my dogs are the subjects of about 99% of my photos.  It's just that they can look so darn cute.  I, for one, am ready for the weekend.  Nothing major planned, but the first week back from vacation always seems the worst.  I want to get into the gym both days and check out Curves.  Other than that, my calendar is wide open -- just what I need after a week like this.

      I got home last night and was really hungry.  I had missed my last two lemon drinks because I was in with my boss.  We were going to walk the dogs, but all I wanted to do was eat, and what I wanted to eat was Mexican.  We ended up going over to Paco's Tacos, definitely the bane of my diet plans.  In fact, I had planned on putting this on my June goals -- NO PACO'S -- but I figured I'd never be able to meet that goal.  Having said that, I am going to add it.  It's not like I made horrible choices.  I did get the carnitas and didn't eat it all, but I did eat until I was uncomfortably full.  Coupled with the missed walk, probably not my most shining moment in the past 2 weeks.  However, I did rebound this morning and got up and took the dogs and my husband for a 45 minute walk (about 1 1/2 miles).  I had forgotten how invigorating morning exercise is.  To top it all off, when I got on the scale, I was actually down, despite my Paco's feast.  Lesson learned however -- I cannot jeopardize my progress by eating at Paco's once a week.  Once a month, however, is allowed.  Some may have guffawed at my post yesterday when I said we had to spell certain words in front of the dogs.  Well,  urlLink this  today from  urlLink CNN .  And if you need further proof, let me tell you about this morning.  Jager is our "little brunch girl."  She would stay curled up in bed until 9:00 AM at least if it wasn't for Baja's frantic breakfast act.  This morning, at 6:55 AM, when I rolled over and asked the sleepy dogs if they wanted to go on a walk, you would have thought I just offered them a 40 ounce steak.  Jager and Baja both started whining and whimpering and licking my face.  Of course, both dogs had to "help" us get dressed which involved them sitting on my shoes as I was trying to tie them and trying to grab socks out of Don's hands.    I do have pictures to post this afternoon when I get home.  I was having fun last night with my digital camera and there are some really cute ones, although nothing can capture their excitement when I mention W-A-L-K or D-O-G P-A-R-K.  Here is to a better day of food choices.  I have the exercise part down, now it's just up to me to make the right meal decisions.

      I'm amazed at what technology offers us.  I can even say, "I remember when movies came out on Beta!"  Now, with the advent of DVDs and  urlLink Amazon , you, too, can own the first season of the award-winning sitcom urlLink "Who's the Boss"  for a mere $32.76 (suggested retail, $39.99).  I mean, who is buying this crap?  OK, off my soap box.....  I've added two new reads to my blog.   urlLink Annie  is writing from California and  urlLink Stefani  is writing from Ontario, Canada.  Go check them out!  I believe the end of TTOM is almost at an end.  I got on the scale and it's down to 316, so I'm sure by the weekend I'll be back to the 314/313 range.  Eating was on plan yesterday.  I didn't exercise because of my work schedule, but since I'm getting off early and Don is off, we have a plan to walk the dogs this afternoon.  The funny thing is, we can't even say the word  WALK , we have to spell it out, otherwise the dogs go nuts.  It's the same with  TREAT, DINNER, BREAKFAST,  and  BUBBLES .  A funny thing happened on my lunch errand to the grocery store yesterday.  The store I usually go to just had a facelift, going from a regular Ralph's to a Ralph's Fresh Selection (which means changing everything around so the Pam is now in the aisle that used to house the cleaning products -- very frustrating when I only have 60 minutes to grab everything I need) and they are in the middle of their "Grand Re-Opening."  I guess I was there at the right time because I won a free bag of groceries.  When I got to my car, I took a peek and noticed right away that some of the items were going to be problematic -- a big bag of Tositos chips and Chips Ahoy cookies. When I got back to work, I took them right in to the employee lounge.  Yeah, me!  Off to work on this 1.5 liters of water so it's finished before lunch.

      I know we are now 8 days in to June, but I did want to lay out my goals for the rest of the month.   Eat on plan given to me by nutritionist Phil.  Exercise 4 times a week.  Drink 100 ounces of water per day.  No drinking alcohol alone.  Spend 30 minutes a day reading.  Spend 15 minutes a day doing either house cleaning or maintenence.  Limit eating out for dinner to 1 time a week.  I think the exercise part will be my hardest goal, but I have to remember that even walking around my work complex or taking the dogs for a walk should be considered exercise.  Plus, a Curves just opened 1/2 block from my house (I can see it from my front porch) so I am going to try and check that out this week.  Some of this will get easier once my schedule returns to normal on 6/21 and I can go back to 8a - 5p.    I did forget to mention one thing in yesterday's post.  I had won a free brunch for 2 at the Ritz Carlton in Marina Del Rey.  Don and I went on Sunday and had a great time.  The coupon included champange and tip, so all we had to do was pay for parking ($5). Talk about a spread -- cold seafood, caviar, made-to-order omlettes and waffles, prime rib, dim sum, sushi, Parma ham, bacon and sausage, salads (pasta, green, fruit), a variety of hot dishes and a huge table of desserts.  I did pretty well with my food choices.  I stuck mostly to the fish and stayed away from the bacon and eggs.  I did have dessert -- some creme burlee and a chocolate tart that was  to die for .  Out of curiosity, I called the hotel later that day to see what the brunch costs -- $57.00 not including tax, tip and parking.  I nearly died.  There is no way I could ever see paying $57.00  per person  for brunch -- no matter how much champange I drank.  Anyway, despite my amazement over the price, it was damn good and I would go again (if someone else way paying -- LOL).

      After 9 wonderful days of doing very little, I am back at work.  Once again, I was faced with almost 300 e-mails, most of which have nothing to do with me.  Nothing new on the whole reorganization front.  I know there are a lot of questions still.  I'm torn between wanting to stay in my current position or wait for a package and find another job with another company.  It's scary out there right now, and I'm afraid of what will happen if I don't find a job with the same salary and compensation, but sometimes a major upheaval is what we need to move forward.  Right now, because of the house, I'd say I was leaning towards trying to hang on here, even if it's for another year or so.  I'd really like to reach my 10 year anniversary, which would be 1/22/06.    As far as the cleanse went, I thought I was going to be very happy with the results.  Going into Saturday, it looked like I would end up at 313, which is what I weighed in at on Wednesday.  I even sneaked a peek on Saturday afternoon, and the scale read 315.  I got up early on Sunday and got on the scale, only to be greeted by  318  -- the exact same weight I started at!  Later in the day, the reason for the higher that expected numbers became clear -- TTOTM.  Grrrrr.  I was really disappointed in not seeing the results, although I am feeling the results -- my clothes are fitting better, I do have more energy (although not at the moment), my wedding ring seems looser.  I still wanted the validation from the scale.    So, how did I do with my goals for May?  1. Eat according to plan set forth by Nutritionist Phil  I ate about 75% on plan   2. Exercise on Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday  I consistantly exercised on Saturday and Sunday, but DID NOT accomplish Tuesday and Thursday   3. Purchase/install front blinds  DONE   4. Week of Spring Cleaning (week of 5/29 - 6/6)  90% DONE -- the office still needs work   5. Drink 100 oz. of water per day  DONE   6. No drinking alcohol alone  I did drink alone, but only about times last month.   7. Attend at least one social event  DONE - Mom's Birthday Party (w/o Don)   8. Reach out to friends at least once a week  DONE   9. Take time to read at least 30 minutes per day  I didn't get to read every day, but probably read 30 out of 31 days.   10. No eating out of the vending machines  DONE -- OK, a caveat here....our vending machines were broken, but I'm still counting it!   11. No fast food (exception: El Pollo Loco) DONE -- I even went to a drive through twice -- once to get my boss something to eat and once to get myself a Diet Coke.  No food though!   I need to come up with my June goals, but the areas I need to work on continue to be 1)Eating on plan, 2)Getting exercise, and 3)Not drinking alone.  I think I'm getting better at #3 and with my current plan of doing the cleanse morning and afternoon with dinner in the evening, I think I can do better at #1 as well.  My hardest task will be #2.  I cannot continue losing weight by only exercising twice a week, no matter how much I change my food plan.    Well, back to my overflowing in box!

      So I am officially past the half way point in the 7-Day Cleanse, and you might wonder how I'm doing.  Good, and not-so-good.  I did have a mini meltdown late last night.  I confirmed with my doctor that I was going to have to come in for my 10:00 AM appointment fasting for 12 hours and no water after midnight.  I knew there was no way I could possibly go from 10:00 PM to 10:00 AM with just a swig of lemon juice as my last meal.  I thought long and hard about it, and finally decided I would have chicken and veggie stir fry with noodles (Trader Joe's frozen section).  There was only about 5 ounces of chicken and about 1 1/2 cups of veggies, so even though the package suggested 3 portions (of minute proportions, I might add), I ate the entire bag.  Calorie-wise, that was only about 800 calories, but I still kind of freaked out because I had "gone off plan."  Also, because I didn't really have a container to put my lemonade concoction into for after the doctor's, I took a small grapefruit juice (70 calories) this morning.  Having said that, I am back on plan now, although I did grab a Diet Coke a little while ago.  Also, according to my scale, I am now at 313.0, which is about a 5 1/2 pound drop from Sunday morning.  As a little ego boost, my doctor's scale read 310 (actually, the first nurse who weighed me put me down at 304).  I told my doctor that most people complain about their doctors' scales, but I was  very  happy when I saw her's.  She even put 310 in my chart since that way we will always be comparing apples to apples when I see her.  My doctor's visit went well.  She had done up some blood work about 2 weeks ago and my numbers seemed way off.  Instead of saying, "Well, that's just how it is," she made sure to re-do it and send it to another lab.  She also explained that I am "metobolic resistant" and there is nothing more that I can change (diet and exercise) because this is just how my body operates naturally.  Even if I did reach the ideal weight, I would probably always have problems processing food and nutrients, which means I will have to continue to take meds to combat this.  The good news is that my blood pressure was good -- still borderline high at 132/84 (she wants 130/80) -- but she thought this was a big improvement.  She is happy with my food and exercise plan, although instead of cardio of 4 times a week for 60 minutes, I should try 5 times a week for 45 minutes.  I have a hard enough time getting into the gym 4 times, but it's something to strive for,  As far as the cleanse, I had to seriously look at how it's affecting me.  Last night was hard, and I did feel like a failure.  However, I do think that if I can stick with it for another few days and get the scale to read 309, it will be worth it.  Also, even though I was really hungry and looking for any excuse to put solid food in my mouth, I didn't cave in and "reward" myself by going to Paco's Tacos for a #9.  I made a healthier choice by eating something with veggies and protein, and even though I went over the recommended portion, I don't think I harmed myself too badly.  I mean, 800 calories in 3 days is nothing!  I am feeling much better because of the cleanse, and while I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone, it is pretty powerful if you need do drop water weight for a special event in a short amount of time.  I understand that Howard Stern's sidekick, Robin Quivers, has lost 60 pounds while drinking the lemonade for breakfast and lunch and then having a healthy dinner.  I can't say I could ever do that, but I could stick with this for another week or so if I got to eat at least 1 meal a day.  Off to check in with my nutritionist.  His scale weighs me more than my own scale, so I have to remind myself not to let those numbers affect me in a negative way,

      My dogs take the Patriot Act very seriously, and are willing to defend our air space with exceptional vigor.  On Wednesday, three ballons -- a yellow and a blue regular ballow, and a Happy Birthday mylar ballon, got caught in our neighbors' tree which hangs over our driveway.  For the last 4 days, they have been barking at these damn ballons.  Finally, they worked themselves free, only to get caught on the tree in the yard behind us!  To top it all off, the dogs felt it was their patriotic duty to notify the entire neighborhood that a blimp was invading their air space.  The good news is that it looks like the offending ballons have moved on, only to (hopefully) never return to this corner of the world.  So, most of my day has been spent planning my new food plan into place.  I went out and bought a George Forman grill, and have already put it to use.  Here is the plan:  Breakfast:     2 oz. turkey, 1/2 grapefruit Snack:          3 oz. tuna, 1 c. greens Lunch:          3 oz. chicken, 1/2 potato, 1 c. green Snack:          3 oz. tuna, 1 c. greens Dinner:         2 oz. fish, 1 c. steamed veggies, 1 c. greens Snack:          3 oz. tuna, 1 c. greens  Exercise:      5 days, 20 minutes walking / 2 days resistance training  Water:           100 ounces per day  I'm starting this tomorrow and will continue through Saturday, Snack #1, only because I am going to Del Mar racetrack for a friend's birthday.  I will start again for another week and see where we stand.  The big no-nos on this are sodium, fat (olive oil, butter, dairy),  alcohol, red meat.  This is my first step on my journy through the 10% Challenge.  We'll see how this goes.

      Well, July has two moons, and, well, I am having two "moons." Nothing like TTOTM twice in a month. It's kind of like on those two months a year that have 3 paydays, only not as good. Not nearly as good.  Here's an interesting  urlLink article.  Since my husband reads this site, I won't answer if I fall into the 70% category. Although Baja gets jealous when Don is kissing me, it's usually just barking at us. I don't think this is called for:  In these situations, Dodman describes his role of animal behaviorist as a combination of three things: first, a family counselor, sorting out the family dynamics that involve the pet; second, a psychologist, treating the disturbance using behavioral modification techniques; and third, a veterinary physiatrist, prescribing mood altering medication and dealing with underlying medical problems that may be fueling behavioral issues.   Thank you for all your nice comments about the photos.  I could totally move there, and it's pretty close to heaven.  Just thinking about it makes me want to start to count down to next year!  Nothing planned for the weekend.  Don is working both days, but a 2P - 11P shift, so we can get a walk or two in and maybe even a trip to the dog park.  I would like to get some things organized that have been piling up (replacing my books I took on vacation).  I'd also like to order some of the photos from   urlLink Shutterfly  for my album.  I am going to do some serious rethinking about my plan of attack regarding my diet and exercise program.  I have some ideas, but when the scale has not budged in several months, despite eating right and exercising, something drastic needs to be done.

      Just when I think I am close to done with my e-mails, a flood of red overtakes me!&nbsp; At least my boss is out of the office this afternoon so that should make it a little easier.&nbsp; Plus, I'm leaving at 4:00 PM to go with Don to pick up his new car -- a Honda Civic Coupe LX.&nbsp; We have to drive up to my old hometown of La Canada to pick it up, and we'll hit one of my favorite places for dinner -- Pepe's.&nbsp; Growing up, Pepe's was one of the hot spots along Foothill Blvd.&nbsp; It was always packed on a Friday night during football season.&nbsp; The decor hasn't changed in over 20 years, and even some of the wait staff is the same.   I do have photos&nbsp; to post from vacation, which I will try and do tomorrow.&nbsp; I have some great ones of the dogs.&nbsp; On our first day there, Jager spotted a lizard run into some bushes.&nbsp; For the next  2  days, everytime I looked at her, she was staring into the plant bed just waiting for that darn lizard to come out.&nbsp; We also came up with a "game" we called Pool Ball.&nbsp; Don and I were in the pool and we would bounce the balls to the dogs, although we were trying to get them back into the pool.&nbsp; It was silly, but it tired the dogs out!&nbsp; Baja and Jager enjoyed their walk on the beach -- Jager even went into the ocean!&nbsp; Baja slipped into the pool a few times.&nbsp; It's actually a good thing he doesn't like to jump in after the balls -- we'd probably never get him out!   One of the best parts of the vacation was our 80 minute Hot Stone massage at the Four Seasons.&nbsp; If you've never had a Hot Stone massage, I would highly recommend it.&nbsp; They take large, smooth river stones and rub you with them.&nbsp; It's really relaxing.&nbsp; I could barely move after it was done.   We enjoyed some really good meals as well (hence the 6 pound gain, although I was down 1 1/2 pounds as of this morning).&nbsp; I cooked most nights and made things like mussels, beef ribs, risotto, pork loins, etc.&nbsp; Our dinner at the Wine Cask was very nice as well.&nbsp; That was the only night I really felt close to overeating, partly because of the champange and wine we drank.   We also watched TV that we wouldn't normally, including getting hooked on VH-1's "I Love the 90's."&nbsp; We caught some of the 80's as well.&nbsp; Talk about bringing back memories.&nbsp; The songs, the fashion, the trends!&nbsp; What were we thinking??

      I don't want to be back.  I want to be still up in Santa Barbara, lying by the pool, watching Jager stalk a lizard.  Seriously.  I had to come back to reality at some point I guess.  Gazing lovingly at Don will not get the bills paid.  We drove back yesterday afternoon since we both have today off.  We're pretty much unpacked, although I still have some to do.  I ran my errands -- gas, car wash, grocery store.  I'm catching up on my blog reading.  I still have to put my books away and finish reading my mail, but I should be ready to go back to work tomorrow (groan).  The reason for my coming into work on Thursday was actually a good one.  I did get to meet my new boss, so that was nice.  She will continue to live in Salt Lake City, and it's been awhile since I worked for someone who didn't sit in the same office, but I think I'll be able to adjust pretty well.  Plus, now that we have a strong leadership team in our office, my job has become much easier.  The big news was that one of my former employees who now reports to one of the other leaders in the office won one of our big giveaways.  We always focus on our preferred suppliers and award prizes from those vendors -- airline tickets, hotel stays and car rentals.  The big giveaway at the end of the quarter is a drawing from all the previous quater's winners.  They gave away  3  Jeep Liberties!!  It was very cool to watch the expression on the lucky employee's face.  She drives about 80 miles roundtrip (Palmdale to LAX, for those who are familiar) each day, so having a new car is a great thing for her.  I checked out the car when it was pulled up to the office -- I didn't get to check out all the goodies, but there was an in-dash 5-disc CD player.  Speaking of new cars, Don's lease on his Honda Civic is about up so he is in the process of looking at new cars.  Since we don't like the whole negotiating process, we use a car broker.  It's pretty cool -- we call up and let him know what we want and he can deliver the car.  It works out well, and we don't have to dicker with the price.  Plus when I have cost compared, it's very similar, and what we save in stress makes up for it.  I will be in the market for a new lease come February.  I will probably stick with Honda, most likely an Accord, which is what I have now.  I would be tempted by the CR-V, though.  Of course, the worse part about coming back to reality is getting on the scale like I did first thing this morning, and found that I was up 6 pounds.  I am going to have to do some serious re-thinking of my current health plan going forward and figure out how I can work on getting healthy.  I've got to stop fooling myself and start getting real.

      Just a quickie update.....  The last 5 days have been wonderful -- playing in the pool, reading, relaxing, spending time with Don & the dogs.  We had a great dinner at the Wine Cask on Saturday night to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary.  The Wine Cask catered our wedding dinner and we make it an annual dinner.  I also ordered a small replica of our wedding cake, which we had last night.  It's just been very relaxing -- exactly what we needed.  Of course, I am typing this from home.  Yes, I realize it's only Thursday, but there is a big pow-wow at the office at 10:00 AM and my new boss is going to be there, so I figured that it would be politically correct for me to drive down from Santa Barbara for the meeting -- especially in light of the fact I was told Friday that, at least for the forseeable future, I will have a job.  My team is changing a little, but it keeps me employeed and the paychecks coming, and that's what's important.  Plus, I am curious about meeting my new boss.  I don't plan on spending more time in the office than I have to, although I am putting down 8 hours and taking Monday off.  Hey, it's a 4 hour drive round-trip so it's the least they could do.  The weather has been grerat -- sunny, in the upper 70s, with a nice breeze.  We've been spending a lot of time outside.  We even got Baja in the pool a few times.  He loves standing on the top step, but usually won't go in on his own.  We've only seen some coyotes so far, although I think the dogs have sensed other animals.  That's about it from here.  Better head into the office soon -- much to my chagrin...

       OK, not a jet plane, but a car.&nbsp; Regardless, I'm on vacation in&nbsp;55 minutes.&nbsp; I'm only working a few hours this morning to wrap a few loose ends.&nbsp; I have errands and packing to do and we'll leave about 10:00 PM after Don's shift.&nbsp; It will take us about 90 minutes to get to Santa Barbara, but at least we won't have traffic.  &nbsp;  I'm not sure how often I will post as we'll be on  dial up  (see how spoiled I am??), but I will try and at least get some photos up.  &nbsp;  Hope everyone has a great weekend!     &nbsp;

      Although I have a knee wrap on, I'm actually getting around pretty well.  According to the doctor I may have a slight tear in my lateral meniscus and it should heal on it's own with rest.  The good news is that I will be by a pool all of next week so I can still do some exercise, even if it's not a treadmill.    I've been busy getting ready for our vacation.  I have to laugh at what we take when we go to Santa Barbara.  Since I will be cooking, I tend to take a bunch of food and beverages.  I also take a lot of reading material.  And, since there is a tub big enough for two (hee, hee), I also bring my stash of bath salts, oils, bombs, etc.  I'm not taking a lot of clothing -- just some shorts, tee-shirts and a bathing suit.  Regardless, it seems like we pack the trunk of my Honda to the gills every year.  I'm still waiting for word about my job.  We are supposed to find out something the week of the 12th, but that never means early in the week.  With my luck, the memo will come out Friday at 4:55 PM, and I'll be long gone by then.  For some reason, I'm not all that worried about it.  The decision doesn't have anything to do with how I am doing my job, it's just a corporation reorganizing.  I'm sure if I found out I was losing my job I might be a little less relaxed.  Here's to a great Hump Day!

      Normally, I would say one.  However, after last night I would have to say none -- let your husband do it.  As I was closing up the house last night on my way to bed, I realized that the automatic garage door was off track and it wouldn't close.  I couldn't quite reach the wheel to try and get it on track, so I decided that I would use the ladder.  This, despite the fact that it was 9:00 PM and Don was at work until 11:00 PM, I thought was a good idea so Don wouldn't have to deal with it when he got home.  My home repair tip for the day:  Don't get on a ladder with flip flops on.  I almost had it, but slipped, caught the back of my flip flop on the rung and fell from the 3rd rung.  I had the wind knocked out of me and strained my knee.  I am waiting to go in and see my doctor (she can't see me until 1:00 PM) since I can't put weight on it and it twinges every time I take a step.  My guess is that I possibly strained/sprained some ligaments.  I don't think it's anything serious, but I know I have to have it looked at and braced.  In the meantime, I am stuck on the couch watching bad morning T.V.  Right now I am watching The Maury Show, which once again is doing paternity tests.  This time it's women who have been on multiple times trying to figure who fathered their child.  This amazes me.  I can honestly say that if I ever got pregnant (in my single days, natch), I would have no problem identifying the father.  This show is just sad.  One woman has 4 kids and only knows the father of two of them, and only found that out after testing 7 guys.  And, yes, the remote is within reach, but this is just too much like watching a train wreck.  The song and dance is always the same....."look at the baby, look at this guy -- they look exactly alike."  And the women are all 100% sure the man they have drug in is the father.  When Maury says, "And you're not the father," the men all jump out of their seat and raise their hands in victory and get in the woman's face.  Needless to say, I feel so sorry for the kids.  Some of the men say they would be happy to take care of the kid, if it's theirs, which is nice to hear, since so many of these guys don't look like father material.  Anyway, no more high wire acrobatics for me for awhile.  I just hope this doesn't interfere with my vacation plans....

      It's July, right?  I mean, smack dab in the middle of summer.  The weather outside may be frightful, but I don't smell snow in the air.  So, why is  urlLink Hallmark  rolling out their Holiday Ornaments?  Yikes!  I actually feel like I'm behind!

      I haven't been sleeping well the last few nights.  As I was walking in to work this morning, I realized I haven't been feeling "well" for several weeks.  First, it was my allergies.  Then it was my shoulder/elbow.  What is scary is that I am too busy to take care of myself.  I'm sure my allergies has transmorphed into a sinus infection.  There is no reason why I should be taking pills and using nasal spray on a daily basis.  I should not wake up at 3:00 AM with a major sneezing attack.    I was taught at a very early age to "play through the pain."  I was a tom boy and played a lot of sports, and was always sporting bruises, cuts, strains, etc. and usually with pride.  The only way I earned a trip to the emergency room was if the bleeding wouldn't stop or a bone was showing.  Sprains, strains, pulled muscles, etc. were treated at home with aspirin and ice.  So it's no wonder that, even though I feel crappy and I'm in pain, I don't do anything about it.  This is how I was taught to treat my body.  I don't think I'd cry over every hangnail or stubbed toe, but I need to listen to my body when it tells me it's not feeling well.  And I need to do something about it.  Having said that, I am going to try and get into my doctor's this week to get some antibiotics to treat the sinus infection.  I'm also going to make sure I see my chiropractor to take care of my shoulder/elbow.  I refuse to go on vacation in pain!  Time for my staff meeting.  It's the first since we've gotten the new leader here in the office, and I'm actually pumped.  The previous leader, with whom I did not get along, didn't believe in staff meetings, so while my team knew about initiatives and new programs, the other half of the office did not.  This is going to be the first of many I am sure.

      I am really looking forward to my vacation.  Although if rumors are correct, we will hear if we are impacted by the recent reorganization by 7/16 -- the day I'm supposed to leave.  I also got a somewhat ominous e-mail from my boss stating that our next Leadership meeting was mandatory.  Oppps....I'll be in Santa Barbara.  I e-mailed her that, but haven't heard exactly how mandatory is mandatory.  If it's important, maybe I can do it via conference call (I can take it by the pool.....).  Our weekend was nice, but it didn't seem long enough.  We went to see  Fahrenheit 911 , which was very moving.  I lost 17 people on 9-11, so the opening scene was very powerful.  In my case, Michael Moore was preaching to the choir, but it gave Don and I something to discuss that night over dinner.  I was surprised to see the theater so packed, especially with  Spider-Man  opening this weekend.    I did have to work yesterday, but we only took about 10% of our normal call volume, so I got a ton of paperwork, filing, e-mailing, etc. done.    Today, on the other hand, has really kicked my butt.  The day after a holiday usually does as people return from the office and suddenly remember they need to make travel plans.  They don't realize that all of our clients are in the same boat, and they can't understand why we are so busy, and can't I put them through to an agent right away?  Hey, lack of preparation on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.  Ah, well, it's all part of the job.  I do have a funny customer service story that happened on Friday.  One of my agents told me that he had an irate client on the other line.  I took the call, and it was a Social Worker from the County of LA.  She was steaming mad about one of my top VIP agents.  She says, "How dare she tell me she has issues with me!!"  I'm frantically looking through the record trying to figure out what the heck she is talking about.  What I found was that when my agent faxed her the ticket confirmation, she had typed, "Sue - have issued e-tickets."  What actually appeared on the fax was, "Sue - have issue," and Sue took this to mean that my agent had issues with her.  She would not accept my explanation.  I finally told her to ask for one of the other 3 agents on the desk.  Man, oh, man....  I think she was really upset that my agent insisted she get authorization to spend well over $1000.00 on a ticket when we could get it for closer to $500.00 with connections.  Heck, it is tax payer money, we should be concerned and trying to help them save where possible.  Anyway, that was my exciting weekend.....

      One of my agents is leaving for a new job and her last day is today.  I'm sad about losing her, however I understand her reasoning.  The account she works on was bought by a larger company and, within the next 3 months, we will probably lose the account.  She didn't want to "wait and see," so she took a position with another travel company.  Of course, this means good-bye parties and the fact that there are two cliques that don't play well together forces us to have two different dinners.  One was last night at Paco's Tacos and tonight it will be  urlLink P.F.Chang's .  Since I am her boss, it's somewhat expected of me to attend both.  In addition, I am getting her a Cold Stone Creamery cake this afternoon.  Needless to say, this has not been a good few days for food or exercise.  Which is why I am waiting to update my monthly weight chart.  Hey, it's my blog, I'll update when I want.....  The most exciting thing is that Don actually has Saturday  AND  Sunday off.  He's been working hard as  urlLink Fox Sports  just re-launched their web site with a new look.  I plan on taking  very  good care of him this weekend.  We are planning a dinner and a movie night on Saturday.  We both wanted to go see  Fahrenheit 9/11  and as much as I was willing to go by myself last weekend, I wanted to wait so we could see it together.  Sunday, we will BBQ and hang out with the dogs so they don't get too freaked out from the fireworks.  Luckily, we don't have anything exploding right over our house (actually one of the benefits of being so close to LAX).  Now if I could just get my allergies to STOP! I would be in great shape.

      I don't know why weekends are the hardest for me to stay on plan.  I totally thought I had Saturday planned out -- eating my first 3 meals (at least the first two) and drinking moderately at the races.  I did keep my drinking within my limits (about the equivalent to 3 beers), but I didn't eat all day until about 4:30 when Don and I shared a bag of kettle corn (we only ate about half the bag, but it was a  large  bag).  We then went to TGI Friday's where I thought I could easily choose my dinner, but I ended up having a minor panic attack.  I think it was a combination of spending so much time in traffic (it usually takes about 2 hours from our house to downtown San Diego, and it took  3  hours to get just to Del Mar!!), the crowd at the races, the fact my knee and legs hurt and not having eaten almost all day.    Yesterday was just as bad -- I didn't eat breakfast until about 11:00 and then didn't eat anything else until about 7:00.  And I know that not eating just messes with my metabolism.  Anyway, despite all the not eating on plan I did, I am down a total of 5.5 pounds for the week and 11.2 pounds since 7/26.  I would really like to see the other side of 300 by my birthday on 9/5, which is 4 weeks away.  I know it's an aggressive goal of about 4.5 pounds per week, but I think I could do it.  I finally got around to doing my measurements yesterday.  I wish I had done it last weekend, but I still think I can track my goals.  I also had Don do some (hopefully) before photos.  They were a real eye-opener, that's for sure.  I am not going to post those, at least not until I can post some after ones!  The good news is that I did walk a ton on Saturday.  We did a 1.5 mile walk with the dogs before going to the races and then we walked what seemed to be at least 2 miles once we got to the track.  My knee and legs were sore, but they held up.  I didn't do much yesterday, but I have a new exercise band I want to try this week.  I'm still waiting for my MRI results, which I hope I hear from my doctor today.  If they want to do something, I'd rather have it done sooner than later.  I also want to properly plan my foods since it looks like the majority of the weight loss is going to come from reducing calories rather than cardio exercise.  At least I can still go to the gym and do weights, even if it's only upper body for right now.  It's progress, and that's all I'm asking....

      I enjoyed reading about  urlLink Dazed's  proposal so much, I thought I would post mine.  Don and I had been discussing marriage for some time, but he wasn't ready to propose yet -- he wanted a better job.  It was getting to the point where I thought, "Maybe  Glamour  was right -- most men think why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?"  But my birthday was a few days off and then there would be Christmas.  I had decided that if he hadn't proposed by the end of the year (1998), I was going to have to talk to him about it.    So, it's September 1, 1998.  Don and I were going to meet some friends at the Baja Cantina after work.  My last appointment of the day was running late (Shannon from British Air -- I will always remember that), thus making me late in hooking up with my friends.  I hated to be late because Kristi used to rag on me when I kept her waiting (dysfunctional friendship -- long story for another day), so I rushed into the apartment to get Don.  He had to brush his hair before we left, and as he went into the bedroom said, "Oh, a package came for you from my sister.  It must be your birthday gift."  As I said in #32 of  urlLink 100+ Things About Me , I cannot let an unopened package remain so.  I figured while he brushed his hair, I could at least peek at it, even if my birthday wasn't until the 5th.  I also thought I knew what it was -- his sister's famous caramel corn.  Yum!  I opened the box not paying too much attention to the address or return address or to the packaging.  All I saw was a tupperware full of caramel corn.    Don had come out of the bathroom by then and was in the living room while I was still in the kitchen.  I opened the tupperware to grab a handful of sweets and saw a card.  I thought it was kind of a weird place to have put the card, but whatever.  I opened the card, and it was in Don's handwriting.  I walked into the living room reading the card and Don was pulling out red roses and a bottle of Champange.  In the card, he asked me to be his wife.  I was stunned.  He had to point out that the ring was still in the tupperware of caramel corn, I was so surprised.    He had made me speechless.  I remember saying, "You sent the ring to your sister in Cleveland and had her mail it?"  No, silly goose, Don had taken a box, put postage on it from something his mom sent him, disguised his handwriting on the address, used a September 1 USA Today (good thing I  didn't  pay that much attention to the packing material) and hid the ring in some Fiddle Faddle.    Needless to say, we didn't go meet our friends.  I immediately called my mom and told her.  I then called my dad, who wasn't home, but Dean answered.  I was making casual conversation with him and he asked, "How is that boyfriend of yours?" and I said, "Well, he's not my boyfriend anymore."  Stunned silence on the other end.  Before he could say anything else, I said, "He's my fiance!"  Of course, when my dad got home, Dean pulled the same prank on him.  The one thing I joke about is he never actually said, "Will you marry me?"  He jokes that I never said yes.  My response, I acted yes!   Anyway, that's my story.....  As far as foods -- still on plan.  Today would have been a roadblock in the past with my mid-day doctor's appointment throwing my schedule into chaos, thus allowing me to have a reason to go off plan.  But, no....I packed my breakfast, morning snack and lunch.  I should be home in time for my afternoon snack.  The only deviation was I forgot to make my special dressing, and we didn't have any fat free in the house, so I am using some on my two salads today  I measured the amount, and it's actually half of a serving, so not too much damage.  I continue to maintain my 1.4 pound per day loss, and will probably keep this up until next Wednesday.  Tomorrow will be a challenge -- Beerfest at the races, but I'm prepared for it, and will be eating on plan for breakfast and my morning snack.    Hey, I can't be perfect 100% of the time!

      ....than a summer cold?  OK, I know there are worse things, but when you are sitting at work with a stuffed up nose, it just doesn't seem like there is.  I only have two more mid-year reviews to present.  As a typical procrastinator, they will be done tomorrow.  At least I have easy ones.  There are some leaders who really struggle with their staffs.  Also tomorrow, at 1:30, I have an MRI.  At least I'll know how serious it is.  Of course, it feels great today and I seem to have regained most of my flexibility.  I guess the upshot is that if they don't find anything I can quit making excuses about not doing my cardio.  Food have been right on, so I'm pretty proud of that.  I did discuss this food plan with my  urlLink nutritionist  and he's OK with it on a 2 week maximum basis.  I had planned on doing this through 8/15, but I'm really starting to hate tuna and dread my meals.  However, on a mid-week weight check (awww....who am I kidding, I've been weighing myself every morning.  Complusive?  A bit.) I am down 4.2 pounds, meaning since 7/26, I am down 10 pounds.  Of course, I get all excited and figure that if I can lost 9.8 pounds in 7 days, that would mean I would lose 19.6 pounds in two weeks!  Unfortunately, that's not how this works. I have to check in with Phil on Monday and let him know what my 7 day loss is and then we are going to add foods to slow it down.  I am being good about recording everything in to  urlLink Fit Day  that I am putting in my mouth.  So far the only deviation was a teaspoon of teriakyi sauce over my fish last night.  The down side of this is I am starting to feel tired, and I'm not sure if that is because of the cold or the diet.  Regardless, I plan on eating as much as I can on plan on Saturday, but still emjoying myself, even if that does mean a few beers.

      I got to thinking, after reading  urlLink Losing The Cow , that this food thing should not be that hard.  Bottom line, fewer calories + more movement = weight loss.  There are a few things to add to the equation, such as what  kind  calories one needs.  Some process protein better than carbs.  Some need carbs because they are hypoglycemic.  There is a plethora of books and free information to help you figure out how your body processes food.    OK, so I can get my mind wrapped around that concept.  I can even understand why too  few  calories can cause you to not lose weight.  This is where my logical mind is overcome by my emotional mind.  See, I've been eating on plan  EXACTLY  for 3 days.  I'm not finding myself physically hungry -- in fact, I'm having a hard time keeping up with all my meals I'm supposed to be eating, and I'm actually not having the last optional meal.  I haven't added olive oil, butter or salt to any of my cooking.  I've actually eaten fish for 2 nights in a row, and have enough fish thru Sunday.  I've come up with a pretty great dressing substitute (worked wonderful on asparagus last night).  I've seen about a 2 1/2 pound loss since Monday morning.  In a nutshell, I should be sated.    What gets me is thinking to myself, "Boy, does a hamburger sound good now."  Hamburgers aren't on my plan.  I'm not that hungry.  So why is my cotton-picking mind thinking about hamburgers?  How the heck did emotions get entwined with the physiology of fueling your body?    We think food helps our stress level, when all we do is stress out after we've eaten about how fat we've become.  Food is supposed to comfort us, when actually we are getting more uncomfortable in our bodies.  Food does not make us happy, it can actually make us sad.  We eat when we're lonely, thinking that food is our only friend, yet it's the food that's keeping us locked inside.  Food's only job is to give fuel to our body so we can live.  It's not there to comfort, relieve stress, make us happy or alleviate our loneliness.  Food will not make us loved.  This is what I have to focus on -- food as fuel, not as a security blanket.  Having said that, I did talk to my doctor, and she does want an MRI done.  She does think it sounds like a tear, and if I don't get it repaired (i.e., surgery) it's only going to get worse.  I'm not sure what the recovery will be, and how that will affect my exercise (kinda hard to get an effective walking routine in place with one working leg, and I don't think limping burns as many calories).    But I have a new way of thinking about this physical set back.  Instead of thinking, "Well, if I can't exercise, my weight loss program will be getting nowhere, so why eat on plan?"  It's now, "If I have to have surgery, and go through a long period of physical therapy, it's more important than ever to watch what I am putting in my body to ensure I am processing the food as efficiently as possible with little or no activity."  See, positive changes all around.

      I'm not sure how I'm feeling today.  I didn't sleep well -- weird, intense dreams.  Don said I was even whimpering in my sleep.  I woke up when Don got home at midnight and I was covered in sweat.  Obviously something on my mind -- too bad I don't remember what I dreamt about (usually I do -- in vivid detail).  I came into work and forgot I was supposed to arrange coverage for the 7:00 shift, voicemail is still down (now going into the third day), I had a 9:30 conference call, my mid-year review at 11:00, I have to present at least one mid-year today, plus the other leader is out of the office for the next 3 days and I am trying to catch up on her stuff as well (customer service issues, accounting issues).  I truly want to cry.  This weekend should be fun, though.  It's my friend Patty's birthday and we're going to Del Mar Racetrack in San Diego.  They are having a concert and a micro-beer festival, so that will add a little spice.  Patty is moving in with her boyfriend next week, and I think that, coupled with some work shit, is stressing her out a bit.  Hopefully, we'll taste some good beer and win some money on the ponies.  I'm not much of a gambler, and I do pick horses based on their silk colors or names.  I figure $50.00 is a good amount to play with.  My main goal this week is just to make it through without pulling my hair out or taking Don and the dogs and running away.

      Thought that might get your attention.  I am, seriously, down 7 pounds from last Monday, but the reason why you didn't hear my shouts of jubilation is because I know it's all water weight.  Which is a bit of a bummer, however it's still nice to see the scale go down.  Do people understand that we are in an election year, and one that's going to be highly contentious?  CNN did a poll after the DNC.  Here are the stats on those they surveyed:     Of the 1,011 adult Americans interviewed, 916 identified themselves as registered voters and 763 said they were likely voters.   What are the 153 people who are registered voters but not "likely" voters thinking?  People who don't vote and then complain about politics really gall me.  I try my best to stay informed.  I take voting very seriously.  No, I don't vote in every little election (School Board, for example), but I vote in presidential down to mayoral.  We all know this race is going to be close.  And we all saw that votes  DO  count (unless you live in Florida).  So, to those 153 people who are registered to vote, but do not consider themselves likely voters, get off your duff and take advanatge of this great right we have.  OK, off my soap box now.....  So the new eating plan kicked in this morning.  It seems to be OK so far.  I'm not falling down starving, but I do look forward to my next meal.  I've been eating all my foods and actually came up with a killer fat free dressing:  Dijon mustard Balsamic vinegar Champange vinegar Cracked black pepper Dried basil Crushed garlic 1 packet of Equal Lemon juice  I don't know how much of each I used, but it came out darn tasty -- kind of tangy and a hint of sweet.  It's great over my tuna and salad.  No real cravings either, despite two dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts hanging out on the front file cabinet.  Also, it's been a bit of a stressful day -- my co-leader in the office called me on Friday to let me know the phone system went down, so I came into the office at 6:00 AM to reboot the system.  Part of it came up, but the voicemail is toast.  We have to wait for a part and hopefully it will get fixed tomorrow.  I've been running around, trying to help the agents, advising clients, plus playing secretary to our VIP agents (they can forward their phone to me when they go to lunch).  The good news is that I plan on getting out of here by 4:00 PM at the latest -- plenty of time to go home and do my walk.
