						   Hey, ever had one of those moments where you're just stunned into silence, trying to absorb what just happened or what someone just said to you? I just did....  Wow....  I think I'm getting a headache...  Need to relax...  Relax....

						   &nbsp; I find myself getting more involved with other peoples blogs. There are currently 2 blogs i take an active interest in. One's funny yet dramatic, the other's full of self searching. What's mine? Well, judging from previous posts, it appears that I seem to have too much gaming in my head!  Maybe I should cut down on the gaming posting and concentrate on my personal self. I guess maybe I haven't gotten to that stage yet. Here's a go:  I find Decision-making that affects my personal life is usually one of the hardest things to do. Why do I constantly attempt to pursue that which others believe to be impossible? Am I looking for drama to spice up my life? That's what comes when one reads too much or watches too many movies full of ideals, romanticism and hopes. Why can I not accept the norm, or go for that which is a safe decision? I cannot answer this, but I do know I cannot!  I will try...&nbsp; and I can only hope that the other will attempt the same...  Till then...

						   Well, it's Wednesday today, 5 days since my last posting and 3 days since the Magic GP ended. I finished day 1 at 4-3, losing my last two matches rather pathetically to U-W Control, which was arguably my worst matchup, but still....  I didn't realise that I would be as depressed as I was at the end of the day, but I guess it was more to the fact that I was 4-1 at one point. I suppose if I had started the day at 1-3, I wouldn't be that disappointed to the extent that I may have been an asshole at the end of the day and I do apologise to my supporters for that.   In any case, I am truly grateful to one overseas supporter, for providing some great motivation via SMS. Fina, you were fantastic throughout even though you weren't sure exactly how it all works. It would have been great having you around here in person...  Anyway, I woke up on Sunday feeling much better and proceeded to plow through 3 drafts, losing at semis, and two finals respectively. Right now I'm actually waiting to see my updated ratings. By default I should have higher ones, especially considering my current ratings :)  Sunday night, Hafiz, my Magic General&nbsp; Manager gave me a slow-talk over dinner to not quit Magic, among other things. I actually seriously wanted to quit, but I wanted to actually achieve something for the GP, something I haven't done. I guess maybe I'll still play, just not as frequent.  Enough of Magic, onto WRESTLING STEEL CAGE coming up this Sunday!!!  &nbsp;

						   Two days away and we're barely prepared!&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that one of us, Azmady won't be coming as he's flying off to some other country for work.  What's for sure is that we're coming in to the tournament with half of us packing Land D decks. Despite the fact that Gabriel Nassif finished 2nd with his Land D deck at his French Nationals, we are of the opinion it's still very viable. We just need to be prepared to counter the hate available. Oh, Sacred Ground, how I hate thee...  As for freaking COP: Red: I have&nbsp; one maindeck solution, but uncertain if it should stay maindeck now. Those hasty golems keep coming back into my head, I might seriously consider sideboarding it instead.   Hafiz has an entirely different strategy, if Sacred Ground comes out, what to do....  I doubt I'll be blogging this weekend. Should be too busy. Hopefully I'll get back on Sunday night with wonderful news (then again, if I have wonderful news, I'll probably be out partying :) )  &nbsp;

						   &nbsp; Yes. No doubt about it now. Am I falling for her? One can never be absolutely sure. I've always told others that starting a relationship is taking a leap of faith. You will NEVER know FOR SURE.  And yet, we seem to be able to get along well. Of course, it could be due to stuff we have in common. Only time will tell...   Who is she? Maybe later, when I've worked up the GUTS to write her name. For now, it will reside in my heart, where it will be safe...  Ha ha reminded me of a Malay phrase, Makan tak Kenyang, Tidur tak Lena, meaning 'eating doesn't satisfy my hunger, and I can't sleep'.  Oh well, ****, till I meet you again...

						   &nbsp; All this Steel Cage testing and I completely neglected to do some work for the Magic GP tournament this Sunday! Issue now is figuring out what to play after Hafiz brought a Land D deck to the Semi-Finals of one of the GP trials, putting Land D on the map. If 50% of the players turn up with U-W Control I'm doomed. Still no real solution for that, Culling Scales just doesn't cut it. &nbsp; Fina was mentioning that I ought to put my poetry in this blog, which is&nbsp;a good idea really. Hmm, I wonder if it's possible to create a separate page where I can just display poetry, like a homepage, instead of a normal posting. Possibilities.... &nbsp; I can't be bothered changing the date at the bottom anymore, even though it's not accurate in Malaysia. It's only one day. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   After continuous procrastination, I've finally managed to get down to constructing a deck for the Steel Cage tournament, i.e. Eric Bischoff. My constant reluctance to dismantle my Trish has resulted in me having to write down my ideas on paper, which does look easier once I've done it. Hopefully tonight I'll get to do some rough testing.  Note: Any reader who has stumbled upon this blog may have no idea what I'm talking about. Well, here's a link: www.comicimages.com/rawdeal where everything you want to know about the Raw Deal collectible card game is there for your info.  My low for the day was locking myself out of my car again! Man, that really sucked. I wasted time looking around for wires, even asking around and having no luck. Fortunately I found a long stick which I squeezed through the small window opening I had left open (by accident, luckily!) Tying my shoelaces to the long stick enabled me to grasp the lock and pull it open!  I also met a Magic player whom I thought had quit Magic, former Worlds No.5 Sim Han How. Apparently he's at Systematic College. He is still one of the nicest good player of Magic I have ever met. (Ha! Magic: www.wizards.com/sideboard)  My beloved Indonesian chat partner has turned up. More on this some other time. (Believe me, it would take more time than I have)

						   This attempt at keeping some sort of writings of my evergoing life is the latest of probably 20 attempts. This is the 3rd attempt electronically but a first attempt via blogging. May my willpower stay everstrong and work out this time around. I realise I am becoming more reliant on computers for my personal life, with regular use of Yahoo! Chat, friendster and now, this blog. Whether this is good or bad remains to be seen.  My name's Azmin. I'm 26 yrs old. I am currently in that stage of life where I ask myself, "What's Next?" I truly do not know the answer. But more of this another time...  My parents came back from Thailand today. Too bad I couldn't follow. Unfortunately my finances would not have been able to handle it. But I will make the trip, one day. I will attempt to conquer as many unchartered waters as I can in my lifetime. If Death is the time of your life, I will attempt to enjoy my life while I can.

						   I just went on a semi-Testimonial spree on Friendster just now. Good luck to those who got affected. With any luck, maybe ONE of those testimonials will get approved. If you guys aren't happy with any of them, it ain't my fault!!! Blame Arjun... he started it....  Today has been a bit of a trip down memory lane, though. My adopted sister and ex-colleague, Fang Sing, smsed me asking why I haven't kept in touch. It's a question I can't really answer though. It's a definite weakness of mine, keeping in touch with friends i don't meet regularly anymore. Anyway, I smsed her back and got her messenger username so that I could at least chat with her on the net when she's not busy.  So much so I ended up smsing my best friend in KPMG, Yun See, and we're meeting up this Thursday. I feel sincerely  guilty for not staying in touch with her and hope she'll forgive me for it.  When I was in KPMG, she was the best friend I could ever ask for, she was always there for me when it mattered. Everytime I had my lows (believe me there were many), she would be the one to drag me out of it. We'd go out a lot, have a lot of fun, and just enjoy each other's company immensely.  Amcorp Mall news: Joe is off to GenCon Indiana tomorrow. I am not happy for him AT ALL. He is just lucky to be there... I 'm sure he just won the PCQ by accident... I should be the ONE, I, AZMIN!!!! After all, I sleep during tournaments more than he does ... why shouldn't I achieve something too! He's the Apprentice, I'm the Master!!!  Okay, rant over, all the best Joe , and take lots of pics!! You KNOW what I mean....

						   Sleepy Jedi confessions:  I realise I love going to weddings. On Saturday night, I attended a Magic the Gathering friend's wedding with Hafiz in Bangunan Risda somewhere in Ampang. (No don't ask me for directions) Hafiz got lost all by himself and without any help whatsoever from Yours truly. Of course I wasn't paying attention to the roads. Turns out the bridal couple would arrive late anyway, as is typical with weddings here in Malaysia.  Of course we ended up sitting with Magic players, and inevitably we talked about Magic. This included Jafar, everyone's favourite Malaysian Bangladeshi, and Syukri, also known as the Malaysian Idol crew who told me that I didn't make it to the next level. A good portion of our time was spent screwing Jafar over for being a lucksack throughout his entire Magic career. (Yes, this means that he consistently had higher finishes than me or Hafiz, despite starting late !)  Talk also turned to sms-voting reality shows, due to the fact that Malaysia's premier show, Akademi Fantasia was on that night as well. Found out later that a few of the attendees had brought Walkmans to listen through the broadcast!  Night ended with me trying to steal Ai Lin's boyfriend Julian away from her. Unsuccessful of course, as has been the established norms for me. (!) And we got fans for presents too! (a 1st for me)    RAW DEAL WWE POSTING  Well, Steel Cage is over, and let the Trash Talking resume. Andy's gonna get an earful from Ben Goldberg on Sunday I can guarantee you that. Despite actually losing to Andy in the preliminaries, Ben managed to avoid meeting Andy's B2P again who fell to the Undertaker played by Loco in the semis. So Goldberg remains supreme, and what does he do with his store credit? He buys the last starter in the store, Big Show, arguably a good foil against his own Goldberg deck!  Forward viewing, hopefully the Vengeance stock comes in timely so that the Pre-Release will go well (Vengeance has some of the most sought after rares from DO in its starters, eg. Lariat Takedown and Twisted Smiles). Hit the Motherlode!

						   Had an e-mail today asking for reunion of 2004 resignees from KPMG. Not sure if I wanna go... since there are people I don't wanna meet.  However, got another e-mail regarding Lynne and Ahmad's family day which has been changed from camping in Bukit Unggul to to staying at the French Town near Genting! Wow, talk about a change in plans! Pretty drastic, eh? Still looking forward to it, but in a different way. Too bad they're not offering to pay for paintball :)    RAW DEAL WWE CARD GAME POSTING:  Well,  after having played in 6 tournaments since starting play in February, I volunteered to help Wolf to organise WWE tournaments at his shop from now on. Hopefully it will help to reduce his burden so as to concentrate on running  his shop.  His stock has become incredibly diverse, ranging from the CCG games that have been the mainstay sales of the shop to the award-winning and/or obscure (in Malaysia anyway) board games which have been catching the attention of the patrons for the past two months. In any case, volume of sales activity has definitely increased, if not sales dollar (which I don't really know about anyway).  Anyway, first up will be the Steel Cage tourney this weekend (wish me luck!) followed by the Vengeance pre-release in two weeks. Hopefully all goes well..

						   Just wanted to describe how I've been feeling lately and I think this song says it best: Enjoy!   Lately I find myself out gazing at stars Hearing guitars like someone in love Sometimes the things I do astound me Mostly whenever you're around me  Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings And to sing like someone in love Each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud And feeling like someone in love  Sometimes the things I do astound me Mostly whenever you're around me  Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings Run into things like someone in love Each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud And feeling like someone in love Like someone in love Like someone in love

						   Just had an extremely intense LAN Call of Duty session, have not LANned for ages.  Johan and Loco are with me, so of course I got shot more times than I care to remember. But it was amazingly fun but Vasily Zaitsev I am not.  What else happened? Watched Bruce Almighty this afternoon. It was an okay movie, but of course, one would think that if he was given the same powers, he should be able to balance everything out properly. Mogwai (Shaz's cat) added some more battle scars on my skin.  I just re-read my previous post, and have to admit I was on an unnatural high. It's amazing how what some people say can affect me deeply.  I am still high. High on life!! I expect to fall at some point, but no worries.  Quote from Sandman:  It is sometimes a mistake to climb to the top It is always a mistake never to make the attempt.  I will keep on climbing!

						   Doctor's prescription:  Too much of the above leads to an eventual biting of the ass by reality. Reality bites, indeed.  One of my favourite associated taglines was and still is Living On Imagination. I believe imagination is what keeps me going, keeps me alive, keeps me sane in the real world. Sometimes we are too burdened with expectations. Could have, would have, all possibilities, anything could happen why do I worry so much.  Dreams? 'Dream to have a journey... Have me to hug you... Have you to be free.. Do what we want to do...' Sorry, I have to steal that from you dearest, but this is arguably one of the best phrases anyone's ever given to me.  I am incredibly happy!!! I am walking on air!!!! I am going crazy!!! And somehow I don't care!!! I am flying above!!! Stop me if you dare!!! I am in love!!! More than I can bear!!!   If the future be a myth, let the present be full of life.  Lastly, a Bjork song extract:  violently happy 'cause i love you violently happy but you're not here violently happy come calm me down before i get into trouble  If this be a dream, don't wake me up...
