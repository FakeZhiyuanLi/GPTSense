      Yeah so...remember when I said that I was going to leave and not come back until I had something exciting to write about? I lied. I did leave and nothing exciting happened, but I'm writing anyway...out of pure fucking boredom. I'm in quite the rancid mood right now. I'm not sure I've ever hated my job as much as I do right now. I know most of you are out there thinking...'well, it's that awful, quit and find another job, stop being such a whiney bitch'...well fuck you, because it's not that easy. Don't get me wrong...I love Cape Breton, I was born here, it's beautiful and all that, BUT WE NEED SOME FUCKING REAL WORK AROUND HERE! I'm so so sick of talking to ignorant fucks who's main goal is to call you from the middle of no where and scream at you for something that is not your fault. America, I'm sure you're great and all, but some of the most ignorant, self-righteous pricks in the world live in your O-SO-FANTASIC country. Step down from your pedistal, take your head from out of your own ass and take a look around. That's all I have to say about that for now.  On a totally unrelated topic, why do record company's keep giving record deals to absolute tards with little to no musical talent??? This horrid...absolute garbage...metal scraping against metal noise that has been passing for 'good music' on our local radio station is the saddest thing since J-Lo's 3rd marriage. Someone has to let me take over the local music stations around here. In fact, I think I'll start a petition.

      You know, I'm not sure I realized how boring I actually am, until I started this blog.&nbsp; I just plain don't have anything exciting or even remotely interesting to talk about.&nbsp; How about this, I'll go out and find something exciting to do with my life and then I'll come back and write about it.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Until then, I guess I'll end on this note...  &nbsp;    Hello, Mr. Zebra      Can I have your sweater?      Cause it's cold, cold, cold      In my hole, hole, hole.      Ratatouille   Strychnine,      Sometime's she's a friend of mine.      With&nbsp;her gigantic whirlpool      That will blow your mind...        &nbsp;    Hello, Mr. Zebra      Ran into some confusion      With a Mrs. Crocodile     Furry muscles marching on     She thinks she's Kaiser Wilhelm     or a civilized syllabub     to blow your mind...       &nbsp;   Figure it out     She, she's a good time fella.     She's got a little fund to fight for Moneypennies rite's     Figure it out     She, she's a good time fella.     Too bad the burial was premature,     she said and smiled...     ~TA        &nbsp;

      I've become a hypochondriac of grand proportions.  I wasn't always this way.  I used to be fun, easy going, healthy...I was just okay.  Now, I barely know how to live without being in constant fear of phobias.  I'm at a point now, where I just don't know what to do anymore.  Please, take a moment to walk in my shoes... I can no longer eat in restaurants, around people in general, and even find it difficult to eat by myself.  Why?  Because I have an extreme fear of choking to death that I cannot bring under control.  I've gone as far as to rapidly lose 42 pounds because of this phobia (Anginaphobia).  How can you explain to you're family and friends that you can't eat out with them anymore, go to BBQ's, wedding receptions, family/friend gatherings with them anymore because of this?  They don't understand, how could they?  I don't understand it either, I just know that I can't control it.  Going to social events, concerts, movies, even the mall, have become one of my largest obstacles.  The farther away I get from an exit, and know that I can't get out of the eye of the public if I need to, sends me into a frenzy.  What if I take a panic attack?  I'll start to shake, hyperventalate, get light headed and sick in front of all these people.  I'm afraid that I'll never be able to do the things I love, or even act like a normal person ever again. I'm afraid that eventually, the people I love are going to give up on me.  After all, who wants to spend all or any of their time with a 23 year old girl who can do nothing, anymore. I feel like I'm dying, slowly, from the inside out.  I want nothing more than to be healthy, mentally and emotionally again.  The stress of all of this has taken it's toll on me and I'm not sure how much more my body can endure.  I just want to get better.  Do you think that's too much to ask?  In any case, on a slightly happier and more relevant note...a wise man that goes by the name of Maynard James Keenan once said these words to live by:    If there were no rewards to reap,

      Yup...I made it through an entire shift at work today.  I didn't think I would make it, considering the ridiculous work conditions, and my weakened state.  Can someone out there please tell me why/how a person can manage to be so ignorant and horrible to a kind stranger who is trying to help them?  I just don't understand it.  Why are people so mean?  I know not everyone is...But a large percentage of people in the world, are just plain ignorant, self-righteous pricks...Pardon my French... You know, I never really got that saying...'pardon my French', I didn't really use French, I used English.   Anyhoo!  I'm glad to be home, and I guess that's my point.  And, IT'S MY FRIDAY!!!!!  WOOOOOHOOOOOOO!!!   So I don't have a whole lot to talk about...nothing exciting or worth mentioning happened to me today...Wait!  That's not true!  Something good did happen today.  I had a happy moment.  Earlier today, I happened upon a Blind Melon video that I had never seen before.  It was from 1993, 'I Wonder' was the video.  Getting to watch this video made me so happy, it brought tears to my eyes.  Blind Melon, to me, was one of the greatest and most unknown bands that ever existed.  Their music just meant everything to me.  And it fills me with more than enough sadness that they will never make music again as a whole, because of the loss of dear Shannon Hoon. In any case, that was my happy moment for the day.  Ya'll probably think I'm crazy and don't have much of a life, and that may be true, but it does bring me a little bit of comfort knowing that I am, once in a while, still capable of being truly happy.   I think I'm gonna build a fence To keep inside, what little sense... Sense of taste Sense of smell Sense to sit here and feel like Hell I feel like Hell... -SH

      Yup, here it is...my first blog.  I always thought that blogs were really corny and dumb and not worth the time or effort.  But, I'm pretty bored right now and I figure that I should leave something behind before I die, so, here we are.  What should I talk about?  Myself?  Okay...My name is Jennifer, I'm from Nova Scotia, Canada, and I'm F****N proud to be Canadian!!  I am, however, quite tired of this lazy little town and the same old faces, day after day after day...It's soon time for a change.  I'm 23 and I'm currently working at a dead-end job for a really crooked, dumb-ass company (which for the time being, shall remain nameless)...At this job, I do the whole 'technical support thing'.  Helping people day in and day out who treat you like absolute muck and are quite ungrateful (for the most part).  I'm living happily with my boyfriend of 2 years, Nick.  My Mexican Wiener Dog, Chino Moreno, an obese guinea Pig, Sully, and a hamster, Hammish.  Yup, pet central.  Hobbies?  Music.  Music in every way, shape and form.  Music keeps me going.  If Music ceased to exist, then so would I.  Keep in mind though, that I don't always think it would be such a bad thing to cease to exist.  I like weird things, foreign movies with subtitles, music that no one else has heard of, and probably never will.  I don't think any of my dear friends understand me, but I love them all the same.  I'm attracted to scrawny guys, with big hair, tattoos and piercings.  No jocks.  Jocks are yucky.  And, I guess that the last thing I have to say about myself is that I'm plagued by an anxiety disorder that is slowly but surely destroying my life.  Well, I think that about covers it.  I'm out of things to say for now...It looks like rain outside, perhaps thunder and lightning?  Maybe it's time for a walk.

      So I think my appendix is acting up again...Actually I think it's on the brink of bursting, but I refuse to go back to the hospital until I am on the brink of death. Why? Because that's what they want. I've gone to the hospital already for sharp, horrible pains in my lower right side and they sent me home after telling me, 'You are having an acute appendicitis attack...we're not going to remove it though, go home, if the pain gets worse, you start running a fever and throwing up, come back...quickly.' Yup, those are the exact words. So here I wait...in pain...for my appendix to burst. Lord I hate people sometimes. So, it seems that my good friend Amy has adapted my habits and is developing an anxiety disorder. Which is not cool. I wouldn't wish this affliction upon my worst enemy. But, maybe now I have someone I can finally relate to in the whole 'crazy department'. It's strange though, Amy never really struck me as the type that would panic easily over anything. In any case, I hope she starts to feel better soon. I also hope her attacks don't become as morbid as mine. Get well soon Amy. Oh, and for the record, I don't hate all Americans. Only the one's who have given me a hard time (which is the majority of the one's I've encountered). I've also had experiences with some very sweet and lovable Americans. Plus, I can't forget to leave out all of the Americans who make the music I can't live without. You're not all bad. Long live the Rock Gods.  I fucking hate my appendix.
