       Weekends are the hardest. There were very few weekends over the past 5 years that we didn't spend together. I loved the weekends, even though they never seemed long enough. It just wasn't enough time together, we both dreaded Sunday evening when it would all come to an end. His brother and sister in-law are supposed to be visiting with the kids this weekend. I miss those kids too. I loved those kids and I loved being an aunt. That just makes this weekend so much harder, knowing his niece and nephew are here and I don't get to see them. I want to call him, I need to talk to him but I can't. My life's a wreck, I just feel so hopeless.

          I missed him a lot today. I miss him a lot when I go to bed at night. His warm naked body beside mine, the way he smells even the noises he makes when he's asleep. Sometimes he'll talk in his sleep; I always liked to have fun with that when I was having troubles sleeping. Usually he'd start off by mumbling something but if I asked him 'what?' he'd repeat it so I could understand. He says the strangest things.     I just want him to love me, to realize he loves me. I feel that I can't give up on him, not yet. I know some people would just think that I have a fear of being alone but I don't. I'm an intelligent and beautiful woman who has never had troubles finding a man. I've always been a real  guy’s girl,  I'm not a tomboy, I just prefer the company of men. He's says I can do better, that I deserve better but I love him. He always asks why do I love him, I can't control my heart.     Fate brought us together. I sure didn't think I would meet someone and fall in love with him when I did. I've always believed that his best friend brought us together, to help him through his friend’s death. I didn't know his friend too well when he was alive, I feel I know him much better now. I did know however that there was something special about him; I always enjoyed talking to him. Little did I know that his death would lead me to love; what I believed to be my true love.     I hope while we are apart he realizes that we belong together. I'm not at all religious but I am praying things work out. I can't control them and I can't make things go my way but I can hope. If they don't work out then I will have to pick up the pieces and move on but I'm not willing to give up just yet. Maybe the time apart will bring us closer together or maybe it really is over. The only thing I do know is right now, I love him with all my heart.

          Why does he want to see me but doesn't want to be with me? Why doesn't he know how he feels? Why can't he look me in the eyes?   I saw him today; he gave me some of my stuff back, not that I really wanted it, the reminders of him. He wants to see me again next week but why? Today hurt so bad, I just wanted him to tell me that he's been a fool, that he can't possibly live without me and wants me at his side always. But he didn't say those things; he did however wrap his arms around me and tell me everything would be okay. How can he promise me that, he doesn't know? Why did he put his arm around me and hold my hand? He doesn't want a relationship right now but doesn't want to lose me from his life. Why doesn't he understand that I just can't turn my feelings off? I love him and I can't change that.

       I spent the day with my sister but it didn't help things much. We had fun and all and it was nice to get out but my heart is still racing a mile a minute. The littlest, dumbest things remind me of him, I just can't stop. We went shopping and I didn't buy a thing, nothing I saw I wanted for myself although I did see a few things that I would have bought for him.  It was nice to laugh though, we walked by a stand selling t-shirts and there was a shirt with an old friend of mine on it, in character of course from the TV show he is now on. At the time I couldn't imagine buying that shirt, I don’t know, it seemed weird; but now I think I want it, just to make me smile.  He called while I was out, a few times actually according to my call display but I didn't call him back. I wanted to call him but I just felt it would be best for me if I didn't. If he still wants to see me tomorrow he can call me then and we'll take things from there.  How am I supposed to sleep with this thumping in my chest?

          I woke up this morning, before the alarm went off, crying out for him in my sleep. Why do I dream about him? It's bad enough that these feelings have taken over my waking thoughts but my dreams too; I just can't get away. Why did he have to tell me he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and then get scared and run away?   We haven't talked since Saturday and I'm kind of glad. It's not getting any easier though, in fact I think I feel worse. I feel like a shell of my former self. I've just been sitting around watching stupid movies; don't feel like doing much else. I know I need to get out and keep my mind off things but I just want to curl up and be alone. Still going out with my sister tomorrow though since she has the day off, hope that helps.   Thanks to those who have read this and have left comments. I hope keeping this blog does help me heal. I was never very good at keeping a diary as a child, I always felt stupid writing to myself, I don't know why. It's weird knowing that anybody can read this but I'm just a name here, a faceless person over the internet. I like the internet and I think I like my blog.

           He called and we talked for 2 hours today. Nothing was accomplished and I didn't go to see him. He thinks Wednesday now would be best. Putting it off for a few days isn't going to make it any easier; I feel so empty and can't see that changing any time soon. He says he doesn't know how he feels, he says he doesn't have feelings; he says he doesn't want this to happen 30 years from now and hurt me even more. I've known for a long time that he has a fear of commitment but I accepted that because I figured one day he would realize that it's okay to trust your feelings and not everything has to end or turn out badly. He says when he finally did commit to me not so long ago that it was a mistake, it scared him and he started doubting himself again. He told me not to wait for him, not to get my hopes up because he doesn't want to hurt me; but this hurts and I can't exactly turn my feelings off. I don't want to go through my life wondering if he really was the one. At one time I too had doubts; it depressed me and I thought about breaking it off. I looked deep in my heart and thought about how I really felt and what I really wanted, my conclusion was that I loved him with all my heart and soul and couldn't imagine my life without him.  So now here I am, my heart and life in pieces. Wishing he would realize that he loves me and wants a future with me. Wishing that he wasn't so afraid to trust those feelings that I know he has, that I've seen in his eyes and felt by his touch. He was going to call me again tomorrow but I said no. He says he's spent his time worrying about me instead of thinking about what he wants so I figured it would be best if he didn't call me for a couple days. I guess I'll talk to him before Wednesday but I hope he takes some time to think. It's somewhat comforting to know he cares about how I'm doing but he's the one with issues to sort out; hopefully he takes some time by himself to think.  I feel so alone, my friends all have young families or careers; I can't really burden them with my problems. I could use someone to talk to, a shoulder to cry on but I don't have anyone I can; he was my best friend. I just can't talk to my mom or my sister about it and they've all been good and haven't asked any questions about what’s going on. My sister’s solution is shopping, she wants to go shopping on Tuesday and then wants me to have dinner with her and her husband. I just hope I'm feeling okay on Tuesday, I hate crying in front of other people.

        I've spent 5 years thinking that he loved me. Needless to say I'm feeling very used and abused right now. I had a dream he showed up at my door with flowers begging for my forgiveness, yeah right, like that will ever happen. He begged me to forgive him last time, I did and that was stupid. I had trust issues before we met but I decided that it was okay and I could trust him; he's now hurt me more then anyone has ever hurt me. I don't hate his parents but I hate them for screwing him up and screwing him over so bad. They were definitely poor role models as far as relationships were concerned when he was growing up, especially his mother, one bad relationship after another. Why do parents do that to their kids? Now she's dependant on him, he supports her and that's just wrong. I think his main issue is that he needs to cut the apron strings with her, but what do I know right?   My plan was to go back to school but now I don't know if I want to. Part of the reason why I wanted to go back was for 'us' but now that there is no 'us' I don't want to go. I really want to move, I think I want to move to another country even. I don't know if I want to go forever but right now I don't want to be here. I hate this city, there's nothing here for me; all my friends have moved away and maybe it's time I do too. He had me believing that we would have a life together, that's gone and I want to go too.

        He called today, wants to get together on Saturday for a visit. He wants to be friends but I don't know how that's going to work.  My mom's cousins are in town, not sure for how long; a day or 2, I guess. I think my mom will be going back up when they do since she's on holidays after today.

        Today should be our anniversary, I haven't seen him since Sunday and I already miss him so much. I don't know how I'm going to get through this; I wish he knew what he wanted. I hope he knows soon. To top my shitty day off my car cost me $1000 to fix. $200 for the A/C and $800 for the calipers/pads/rotors. Now why didn't they notice the calipers going when I had it in a couple months ago??? I'm not impressed; I can't really afford that right now. He offered to help pay for it but I can't take his money now.

          I wanted to call him so bad today but I didn't. He wants me to be strong and I'm trying but it's just so hard. He's all I thought about all day; I couldn't really function or do anything else. Without him I'm living but I'm not really alive. He's the one I want to share my life with, the good and the bad. He's my best friend; he's the one who makes me strong, who puts the twinkle in my eye and the skip in my step. I want to help him through this but I guess the only thing I can do is give him the space that he needs.

          I saw him tonight, we spent a couple hours together. I still don't know if that was a good idea but I needed to see him and he needed to see me.  I love him so much, I couldn't start crying. I apologized for crying and he just held me and told me to go ahead and cry as much as I need too.  He's still so confused. I hate his family for doing this to him, he feels responsible for people he shouldn't; it's not fair. He says he wants to be with me but then he second guesses himself and isn't sure. I wish he'd hurry up and figure things out, my heart is broken and it won't heal.  It felt so good to be in his arms again, I didn't want to leave. I wish I could just take him away, far away from all the stresses; then I'd know it would be okay.

          I can't believe its August already. I had big plans for this summer; I was looking forward to having some fun. Well this summer has been no fun; it's been worst summer ever.  Today was not a good one; I spent most of it crying. The pain is only getting stronger. I can't believe he expects me to just turn off my feelings, to forget about all we had; how much I love him. I wish I hated him, I should hate him but I can't. I feel this strong urge to fight for him, not being with him just feels so wrong.  I don't understand what he's going through, why he's doing this. He keeps asking me if I do but I don't. I could have waited until he was ready, we didn't have to rush into anything he wasn't ready for. But to tell me he wanted to spend his life with me, to finally commit to me and then turn around and break it off because he got scared just isn't fair. He finally gave me everything I've always wanted, that I've dreamed about for so long and then he essentially pulled the rug out from underneath me.  I can't take this pain, everything reminds me of him. I had a hard time just doing my grocery shopping, which was something we always did together.  It seems everything in this city reminds me in some way of him. I wish I didn't have such a good memory, I remember every place we've been together; practically every moment we've spent together. I feel like I need to leave, to move away from this city. I don't know if I'll leave forever but right now I don't want to be here. I'd like to move to another country but I just don't think I have the resources for that, moving across the country though I think I could do. I've already been looking for a place in the city I think I'd like to move to. I don't want to run away but if he's not willing to try to work things out then I just don't think I can stay. It's too painful here and I don't think I'll be able to heal.
