       Internet Poll   Since today was voting day in PA, I have a question of my own for all you fine people out there:    Would you allow your significant other to move into your apartment if he/she did not currently have a job or any immediate propects?

       If only...   "Cigarette smoke is the residue of your pleasure.  It permeates the air and putrifies my hair and clothes, not to mention my lungs.    THIS TAKES PLACE WITHOUT MY CONSENT!  I have a pleasure also:  I like a beer now and again.  The residue from my pleasure is urine.  Would you be annoyed if I stood on a chair and pissed on your head and clothes without your consent?"  Usually I don't mind cigarette smoke, but sometimes, I leave a bar smelling like a carton of stale cigarettes.  I'm not an advocate of outright smoking bans in bars and restaurants.  I just ask that the owners buy a freaking air purifier that does more than spark!

       Blonde Moments and My Exciting Convention   It must be time to bleach my hair again.  I can think of no other reason why I have been acting ditzier than Jessica Simpson at the White House!  Below is a list of occurances when my IQ dropped sharply below that of Ms. Simpson's!  1.  KFC- I was watching a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial on TV.  The announcer made a comment about  K itchen  F resh  C hicken.  I turned to Paula and Garland and asked, "What does KFC really stand for?"  2.  My accompanist- While checking my email, I came across one from Terry saying that she wouldn't be at the remainder of the choir events for the rest of the season.  I immediately flew of the handle, started calling people, yelling and screaming about the audacity of this woman.  About five minutes later, I realized that the email was from a choir member named Theresa Moncheck, not my accompanist named Theresa Matysik.  It's a good thing I didn't send her a nasty email!  3.  It's getting hot in here- While driving in my car on a warmer day, I didn't understand why the car was so warm, even with the windows down and the vent turned on.  After 20 minutes of wondering, I realized that the driver's side seat warmer was turned all the way up!   My conference in Erie was pretty much uneventful.  I did spend quite a lot of time catching up with my high school music teachers.  They are as insane as I am!  Must be a musician thing.  I did manage to get scrambled brain on the TURBULENT flight to Erie.  No one should ever have to visit that city, for any reason, EVER!

       Waiting for the other foot to fall...   Did you ever have one of those days when everything feels like it’s going so well, but a disaster seems imminent? That’s kind of how I feel right now. The weather is beautiful, things are great in school/work, I have an amazing boyfriend, life, in general right now, makes me smile. I know, collective gasp at Dave smiling at something other than the misfortunes of others! I guess when one has had so many negative life experiences and just a general lack of self-confidence, the days of sunshine and lollipops are harder to appreciate.   I'm sure I'm making little sense to you right now, but amazingly I know exactly what I'm taking about. I don't believe I'm going to say this- something my evil, gnome-like, zero personality accompanist said to me tonight actually made sense (please don't tell her I ever said that!). She said, "Stop worrying about the past, worry about the present." That's exactly what I'm going to do (or at least try really hard to do). Right now everything is sunshine and lollipops. I'm going to enjoy the weather and the treats. I'll deal with the tornado and brussel sprouts when they get dished up!   I'm going to be away for a few days now, staring at a big ass lake in Erie. I'll tell you about my trip when I get back this weekend.    Tanning update- well on my way to Puerto Rican :-)

       Spruce Street Singers...  I am the Accompanist for a gay men's singing group in Philly- www.sprucestreetsingers.com.  Comprised of a great bunch of guys, albeit scary in some instances, we perform music as diverse as the membership.  Today we sang at a birthday party/benefit at Tavern on Camac, my favorite bar in the city.  We sang "gay anthems" such as  Chapel of Love ,  Somewhere Over the Rainbow ,  Do You Believe in Magic? , and  Fire Island Baby  (I'll post the lyrics for that song later).  After our performance, I played through some other Broadway songs- group numbers and some solos.  I can totally see myself as a piano bar performer at some point in the future.  Someday :-)  Time to get ready for another week of school- only two days though, as I'll be at a music conference in Erie, Pa later in the week.

       The 8th Grade Team sucks goat balls...   Some teachers need a reality check. Math, Social Studies, and Language Arts are not the only subjects in the Public School System.  This team of teachers, frequently referred to as the assholes, mother fuckers, or wastes of space feel the need to keep my 8th grade chorus members in class during their SCHEDULED chorus lessons.  Furthermore, the bastard humans keep them during the Activity Period which was specifically designed for full chorus and band rehearsals.  Since my principal is a ball-less wonder, I am left to rectify this problem myself.  Some people really need to get over themselves!  Other than the chorus mess, today went pretty well.  It is a beautiful day finally!  I went tanning for the first time today (fake and bake of course) which makes me feel so calm and relaxed.  Last year I was able to tan during my lunch period.  No such luck this year.  I'll have to wait until after school like normal people.  And lastly in my random post-- I have decided that this whole blogging thing is a highly contagious disease.  One person gets the bug and soon, everyone is typing away ferociously!!  I totally love it!  I even read the posts of people I don't particularly get along with (for a good time, check out www.coopster.net).   Sean and I really don't get along.  If you check the archive from July 2003, you'll find a FABULOUS post about yours truly.    Well enough rambling for one post.  I'm going to make my self go running.  Bathing suit season is fast approaching!

       Children are stupid...  The title of my new book.  Paula and her co-op are also writing one.  God knows the teacher salary doesn't support my "extravagent" lifestlye.  Maybe a book deal will help subsidize the trips to Express for Men (my favorite store).  Anyway....  My 7th and 8th graders had their final projects due on April 2nd, the last day before spring break.  I did grant extentions to anyone who requested one during spring break.  Do you know that some of these moronic children took advantage of this situation and still haven't turned anything in to me?!?!?!?!!?!?! DUMB DUMB DUMB!  I had one 7th grade twit tell me that she couldn't get her project into the car because it couldn't be folded and therefore didn't fit.  Do I have "STUPID" stamped on my forehead???  I think not.  I told her that if it doesn't get to school tomorrow, I would call her parents and make arrangements to pick it up with "my van"  Enough for now.  I need to lay in a dark room and figure out why the hell i thought middle school was ever a good idea!

      Ok so this looks like fun!  Since so many of you want to know what's going on in my amazing mind, I thought I'd give you some insight.  Since my friends and family are sick of hearing me bitch about the annoyances of every day life, I can bitch here and you can read it at your leisure.  Good luck :-)

       3-Day Weekends Rock!   Some weekends really suck and aren't the least bit memorable.  Others are a blast and will live on (in infamy) for a very long time.  Three-day weekends usually end up in the latter category.  It all started on Friday afternoon with a call from Paula having freshly returned from Las Vegas.  The poor drunk was sobering up quickly and wanted to go out.  I was content to lounge on the couch with Garland, but how does one pass up $2 drinks.  Before Shampoo, Garland and I first made the mistake of having dinner at the Burger King near my apartment complex.  This event needs its own paragraph.  Upon walking into the aforementioned dining establishment, it became painfully apparent that those behind the counter were on a work release program- from a mental hospital.  Their combined IQ's didn't break the 100 mark.  I'm pretty sure that one young lady was high on something, perhaps a mind altering med to make her eligible for the work release program.  Amazingly we got our food and headed over to the soda fountain.  No ice. In a normal dining establishment with normal staff, this wouldn't have been a problem.  Unfortunately, this was Burger King, with the mental hospital work release staff, in zip code 1905-trash.  Ten minutes after asking for ice, a very short Mexican man came out carrying a container of ice approximately his size.  It is important to note that the ice machine loading area is a good six feet off the ground.  This small Mexican man (probably here illegally) proceeded to throw the ice over his shoulder into the loading area.  My ever patient and tolerant boyfriend (hehe) had now finished his meal and really wanted something to drink.  Garland got up and went to the ice machine that the Mexican man was awkwardly loading.  Big mistake #1.  Just a Garland was about to leave; the small Mexican man flung another batch of ice over his shoulder completely missing his mark.  Garland got a shirtful of ice.  I will leave out the expletives and sudden, angry exit that followed this incident.  Off to Shampoo.  $2 drinks with a lot of scary men.  All and all, a good time.  At about 11:00 when drink prices triple, we headed over to Tavern.  I learned a very valuable lesson there that evening- never play a new song with little words when you are sloshed.  'Tits and Ass' will never be the same again for those drunks sober enough to remember by slurred singing and la-la-di-dah sections when I couldn't read the ridiculously small print in the Broadway Fake Book.  Saturday was spent recovering from Friday night and playing a wedding in the 'Rican section of the city.  The things I'll do for $175!  We were too tired/hungover to go out Saturday night so we rented an awful movie- 9 Dead Gay Guys- and sat on my couch eating pizza and Rita's.  On Sunday, Cathy arrived for Paula's b-day festivities.  We decided to drive out to the KOP mall for manicures and pedicures.  Big mistake #2.  A very large, generally unfriendly Chinese woman butchered our nails and prolonged the process for about 2.5 hours.  We didn't tip her.  I've decided that I'm going to have that place shut down.  Don't know how, but I'll figure it out.  Sunday night was Tavern again.  We drank and we drank and we drank- either 6 or 7 rounds (we lost count).  Big Mistake #3.  I got sick and had to see my dinner after 3 hours of partial digestion.  Throwing up- not fun.  Drinking, playing, and singing at Tavern for 3 hours- super fabulous fun :-)  Monday was a boring, rainy day spent in my apartment.  This was a great weekend for all of us.  Paula had a great time, as did the rest of us.  I think that girls could have done without Garland and I hanging all over each other (apparently, we can't go 30 seconds without touching each other), but what the hell- we're in love!  Time to fold clothes and iron for tomorrow.  Have a fabulous week!

       Damn! Well said!   From  urlLink 12reasons.com    12 Reasons Same-Sex Marriage will Ruin Society  1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control are not natural.  2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people cannot get legally married because the world needs more children.  3. Obviously gay parents will raise gay children because straight parents only raise straight children.  4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears's 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.  5. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and it hasn't changed at all: women are property, Blacks can't marry Whites, and divorce is illegal.  6. Gay marriage should be decided by the people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of minorities.  7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are always imposed on the entire country. That's why we only have one religion in America.  8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people makes you tall.  9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage license.  10. Children can never succeed without both male and female role models at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.  11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to cars or longer lifespans.  12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages will for gays & lesbians.

       Why drive the Speed limit...   if the cops never bother to set a good example??  I am so sick and tired of being passed by a state trooper traveling a good 30 miles over the speed limit.  That same state trooper will be the one to give me a speeding ticket someday.  Can you say hypocritical?????    If states and municipalities want John Q. Public to drive the speed limit, they need to enforce it amongst the men and women in blue first!

       A Whirlwind Weekend   I had quite the busy weekend.  On Friday, Garland and I took the train to NYC to see a show and visit friends.  The train ride there was pretty uneventful.  Usually when I ride public transportation, bad things happen!  I was lucky this time.  We almost got lost on the subway, but a curt new yorker guided us along.  We stayed with Garland's friend, Patrick and his boyfriend, Jarrod (or it could be Jared, I never asked!).  They have a small one bedroom in the village about one block off the West Side Highway.  It has been my experience that gay friends (especially ex-s) are rude and pretentious in a bad way.  Patrick and Jared (or Jarrod) are neither.  I found them to be very genuine, funny, and all around great guys.    We spent most of Saturday walking and shopping around the village and soho- two places I haven't spent much time. I bought a few shirts and a great pair of pants from Club Monaco as well as some facial products from Origins.  After way too much time in the heat and humidity, we returned to the the apartment for a shower and change of clothes.    Garland and I then went to see Assasins- the new Sondheim musical playing Studio 54.  It was a very, very dark show.  Although not one of my favorites, it was an enjoyable musical.  I really want to go back and see Wicked, Rent (with Jai Rodriguez), and The Boy from Oz.  I'll just apply for a credit card to be used for theater tickets this summer :-)  After the show, we returned to Philly, very tired and sticky (from the heat you sick bastards!).  Today Garland put up my new curtains and added the links section to my blog.  Needless to day, I'm quite tired.  I have some work to do for school/church and then it's off to bed early tonight.    Fallin' fast :-)

       Two Down, One to Go   My 6-7-8th grade spring concert was last night.  It went very well.  You couldn't even tell that we were down 8 rehearsals!  I am so proud of those kids.  Last week, I was seriously questioning the success of this concert.  They really pulled together, focused, and performed exceptionally well!  The audience was extremelly lacking though.  Seems they have something in common with Spuce Street ;-)  Today is Paula's graduation from Temple University.  YAY!!!!  Congratulations, honey!!!  I get a half personal day out of it!  Have a great day :-)

       Musical Definitions   Well, not really!  Some of these are really funny.  I get to thank Lindsay for these.  Gaul blatter         a French horn player.   a la regretto         tempo assigned to a performance by the conductor AFTER it is panned by the local music critics.   allegro non groppo         play fast, and don't fumble for the notes.   approximento         a musical entrance that is somewhat close to the correct pitch.   barbidolce         sweet, but plastic.   bar line         what musicians form after a concert.   basso profundo         an opera about deep sea fishing.   basso refundo         the sad but predictable consequence of the ill-fated "Three Basses" concert tour.   Coral Symphony         (see Beethoven -- Caribbean period).   fortississippi         with mighty, flowing strength.   Katya Katerpilova         Janacek's predecessor to "Madame Butterfly."   matterhorn         an instrument of cosmic influence designed to create something out of nothing.   rooti tooti         use of a potato as a trumpet mute.   toiletto         the effect on the human voice of reverberation in small rooms with ceramic tiles.   woodwind         a noise in the game of golf, made by a club missing the ball on a tee shot.

       How many board members?   Today I had to make copies of the program for tomorrow's concert. After having it proofread by five pairs of eyes, I went to the copy room to run 400 copies.  After running about 375 copies, I noticed that there were TEN school board members listed.  WE ONLY HAVE NINE!!!  It seems that I listed one name twice.  What a waste of paper!  I have decided that programs are unnecessary.   Other then that incident, today was a good day.  I just want this concert over!   Tanning Update- 3 tans away from Puerto Rican!

       Another Concert Down- Two to go!   Well, the Spruce Street Singers concert is done and over with!!!  It wasn't their best performance, but it really could have been much worse.  The audience was terrible, even after all the publicity.  I guess we can't compete with nice weather, a fast horse, and the Flyers all in the same weekend.  I have two concerts left- one on Wednesday and one on June 2nd.  After that I'll lazily coast through to the end of the school year (June freaking 21st!).  In my mind I'm already there!  I had a great time at Tavern on Saturday night.  I played again- two songs I hadn't performed there yet.  John Flynn told Paula and Garland that I should consider playing the 6-9pm slot sometime- the ULTIMATE compliment.  Now I really have the motivation to sit and practice.  It's time for bed.  I hope everyone has a wonderul week!

       The Long Awaited Weekend   This week was unbelievably draining!  You really have no idea how happy I was when Friday night came around.  It's amazing how binge drinking makes everything so much better :-)  My Spruce Street concert is tonight- should be very interesting.  It will either be very good or very bad.  There's no middle ground with this group.  My 6-7-8 grade concert is next Wednesday.  Although I am concerned about that concert, it will be acceptable, just not completely up to my standards.  On the up-side, Pond Road MS did very well at the Musical Theater competition this past Thursday at Great Adventure.  We came in first in the Middle School division and 4 overall (we beat 5 high schools!!!).  Mike won the best director award.  I also got an amazing email from one of the adjudicators.  It really is nice to be recognized by another professional (chair of the music ed. department at Westminster)!  Well enough for now.  I'm off to our pre-concert rehearsal.  I'll let you all know how it turns out!

       Paula is mean   She is purposely  NOT  getting a new cell phone because she knows I hate not being able to contact her.  Then, her phone at home keeps hanging up on yours truly.   HOW RUDE .  I am a (wo)man on the edge.  I do not need this added stress right now. And she took a pretty template from me.  I am tempted to use it anyway just because.  If you can't tell, I'm quite cranky and tired.  To say that the Spruce Street rehearsal was tedious and god-awful would be the understatement of the millenium!  I am going to bed.  When I wake up, Spruce Street will sound good and Paula will have a god-damned cell phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Been a Long Day   That was the title of a song I sang once- can't remember where or when, just that it kept repeating those words over and over.  It's kind of like how today felt- it just kept going and going.  Whoever thought it was a good idea for the human race to work on Monday was terribly mistaken and should be taken out back and shot!   It's almost 9:00PM and I just walked in the door for the night after:  a full day of teaching complete with a sucky 6th grade chorus rehearsal, 15 minutes of fake sun in the stand up booth, a trip to the drycleaners to get a check that I left in my back pocket followed by a trip to the bank to deposit said check (BTW- I think that DEPOSIT is a funny word, not sure why!), a quick stop home to change into shorts and a t-shirt, a run through the Wedny's drive through for a #6 biggie sized with a Sprite (it was after 5:00PM), and finally a two hour rehearsal with Mr. Pirollo and the cast of Leader of the Pack!  What more could a guy want???????  Tomorrow is more of the same, only i get my hair cut by a competent stylist (Garland, you are one of those too:-), not by a dumb bitch who made it look like a gremlin chowed down on my head.  Then its off to spruce street rehearsal for what could be a very scary concert (PLEASE come and support the impending doom- for more info www.sprucestreetsingers.com)  Jesus, I can write alot!  It's sooooo time for bed.  I hope you all have a fabulous week!

       Sick and Tired  Literally.  I had an exhausting week and now I am feeling the start of a head cold- the last thing I need right now.  Thing's won't slow down for me until May 20th.  Between church, school, and Spruce Street, I have been running from rehearsal to gig everynight!  Thank God I have an amazing boyfriend to keep me sane.  Garland puts up with my busy schedule better than anyone else.  That means so much to me!

       I Love My Mother   Although she can be a pain in the ass, I have never received an email like the one below.  This was sent to a gay guy who recently came out to his parents.  Gotta love religion!  Email from "mom":  I don't believe that for one minute!!!!! You were not born gay!!!Did you know that people that are retarded cannot be gay? why? because their minds are not developed enough to allow it.They are not born gay!!!! I feel sorry for you because all you think about is Scot,more Scot, and More Scot!!!!! And there are some things on MY computer that you will be taking off of here when you come home because they are disgusting!!!!! Did you also know that gays have a shortened lifespan due to the fact that they are exposed to so many sexual diseases?Their lifespan is only to about 65 years compared to a heterosexual man whose lifespan is 73 years!!!!!  God loves you but he hates the lifestyle you are in.It is hurting you and it hurts Dad, myself and your sister.Ashleigh says she is afraid to have a boy baby because she doesn't want him to be gay like you!!!! And you have completely broken your Dad's heart and mine too.You will never understand the heartache that you have put us through and all of the lying that we have had to do. But I will keep praying for you and keep loving you just as God loves you.Maybe one day before I die,God will see fit to save you and change your life.  You may feel that you are happy with yourself now, but as you get older your life will definitely change.You can never be happy in this lifestyle because it is not in God's plan, only the devil's plan. So yes, pray for me and Dad, we need it.And we will continue to pray for you.But God doesn't answer the prayers of sinners.  I know that you think Dad and I feel guilty because you are gay.That is the fartherest thing from the truth.We had nothing to do with it.Being gay is something that evolved in your mind and will forever stay there until you come to know Christ as your Lord and Savior. True happiness is something that you will never know until you accept Christ and I have and will be praying daily for that.  I hope you know that anything that you say about God or Jesus against me only hurts you because that is the devil talking through you.I just pray that the day never comes that you become infected with the AIDS virus.I think that is the only thing that would ever make you turn your life around. Although there are some people that have AIDS and they still go out and infect others and never tell them.AIDs is a still a deadly disease-just look it up online and see how the people that have it suffer and eventually die. Is that the kind of life you want to live?  I will close for now and I will keep sending you little messages from Matthew Walker.Maybe one day that will be YOU! Love and kisses, Mom

       Political Fallout is Fun    So the good news- the school board of my district voted last night to renew my contract for another year! I'm glad they did that now because my Choral Concert on May 19th would make them reconsider!   And the better news- it looks like the ball-less wonder that runs my school WON'T be getting a contract renewal for next year! I daydreamed all day long about what it would be like to have a competent principal in my building.   In other news, the Spruce Street Singers concert is going to be a crapshoot. Some songs are ready to go, others blow badly. I have decided that I am not going to play for them next year. Although it has been a wonderful professional experience, I really don't need the added headaches and stress this job entails. I'm sure that I could find something else constructive to do on Tuesday evenings next year.   Finally, I really hate the weddings of people I don't know. Brides are stupid- pure and simple. Soloists have the lowest IQ of any life form in the galaxy (except for Elaine, who knows what the hell she is doing). Being a musical prostitute is very tiring sometimes. The things I'll do for $150 bucks!   Tanning Update- it is SO obvious that I am tanning :-)

       An Interesting Weekend   Weddings are fun, I've decided, especially if they have open bar (top-shelf liquor would have been preferred, but beggars can't be choosers).  I sang at the wedding, and did a damn good job, if I may say so myself.  It was one of those days when I was in tip-top vocal shape (unlike the liquor at the wedding).  I was very happy that I was able to take Garland with me.  We really had a wonderful time, even if we couldn't dance together at the reception.  Wilkes-Barre isn't ready for that quite yet :-)  Because I am a fashion guru, I carefully organized three costume changes on the day of the wedding.  There aren't many gay stereotypes that I don't fall into!!!!  On Sunday, Garland also had the pleasure of meeting my parents.  Although I didn't explicitly tell them who he was, my mother had him pegged as my boyfriend from the get go.  She was good with the whole thing.    Also on Sunday, Paula, Garland, and I went to the Equality Forum block party.  It was another day of shameless public drunkenness.  Oh I do love stoli raspberry vodka and cranberry juice!  The bible thumpers weren't allowed into the area for the first time.  Every time there is a large event in the gayborhood, the bible thumping freaks come out with their eloquent signs reading- Sodomy is a Sin, and the perennial favorite- God hates Fags.  Someone made a very good point on the street, "If the KKK showed up at 36th and Baltimore, you could bet your ass the mayor would do something about them."  Why do we have to tolerate the hate-mongers on our turf?????  This post is way to long.  Enough for now!

      "When will the dawning break Oh endless night Sleepless I dream of the day"           from:  Endless Night, The Lion King    Summer vacation is fun. I don't have to work all that much and I can generally sleep much later in the morning than I can during the school year.  The only problem is nighttime!  It's now about 10:30PM.  I just got home from a rehearsal and I'm not the least bit tired.  I'm about to get very bored!  There's nothing to do at 10:30 on a weeknight.  Everyone else has to work tomorrow, so I can't go out for a drink or a movie.  I can't lay out in the sun for obvious reasons.  For the next 3 hours, I'm going to walk around my apartment looking for things to do.  Last night I played "Bespelled" on my computer for about an hour, folded some clothes, and channel served for the longest time (BTW- cable television is a complete waste of money, as there is never anything worthwhile to watch).  Hopefully tonight's search for activity will be more exciting.    I should probably stop complaining and enjoy all this free time.  During the year, I run from job to job, only stopping at home to sleep or change clothes (check out May's archive).  It seems that I am happiest when I am overwhelmed and stressed.  Being relaxed is simply not my nature.    Ah, the woes of the teaching profession :-)

      Paula is correct.  Contract time in the Catholic Church is frustrating, irritating, and generally a waste of time.  It has been suggested that I disband my children's choir so that I have more time to "sing and play."  HELLO!!  These children are the future of the church and that parish!  Why would you want to alienate them and their parents?  The bigger sticking point is time off-- I am expected to basically be on retainer 365 days a year.  I am expected to plan and execute all liturgies, holy days, major holidays, and any other events that may pop up during the year.  For my hard work, I get a whole three Sundays off!!  Isn't that just grand???  I have a meeting with the pastor and business manager tomorrow afternoon.  I can hardle wait!

      I came across this online.  How are the actions of the   urlLink Catholic Standard and Times    any different than the lies and falsehoods spread by the Nazi Regime before/during WWII??  I particularly enjoy #7.  Sick Bastards.  When I have time this summer, I'll rewrite some of these to suit the right-winged bible thumpers (feel free to help).   Ten Responses to Jewish Lackeys   by Kurt Hilmar Eitzen   Argument 1: "You say that religion is a private matter. But you fight against the Jewish religion!" Counterargument: "Actually, the Jewish religion is nothing other than a doctrine to preserve the Jewish race." (Adolf Hitler). "In resisting all government attempts to nationalize them, the Jews build a state within the state (Count Helmuth von Moltke). "To call this state a 'religion' was one of the cleverest tricks ever invented." (Adolf Hitler). "From this first lie that Jewry is a religion, not a race, further lies inevitably follow." (Adolf Hitler).   Argument 2: "There are decent Jews, after all!" — Counterargument: "This little phrase 'after all' proves that they are rare exceptions of no significance to our battle against Jewry as a whole. But Martin Luther saw four hundred years ago that this "decency," proven by charitable deeds done in as public a manner as possible, is nothing but a hidden cost of business, to repaid a thousand times by uneducated Germans. "Know, dear Christian, and have no doubts about it, that next to the Devil you have no more bitter, poisonous and determined enemy than a genuine Jew. . . If they do something good for you, it is not because they love you, but because they need room to live with us, so they have to do something. But their heart remains as I have said!"  Argument 3: "The Jew has better prices than the German businessman." — Counterargument: Any crook can sell junk. Jewish crooks have driven thousands of German businessmen to bankruptcy with the glittering trash in their department store palaces. When someone does get good products more cheaply from the Jews than from Germans, it is only because the united Jewish firms force down prices from the manufacturers, which means reducing workers' wages. He who has bought good products cheaply from the Jew should never forget that the curse of a German worker and the tears of his hungry children come with them!  Argument 4: "There are also 'white Jews' [i.e., Gentiles who are as bad as Jews]. — Counterargument: "That speaks against the Jews, not for them! The fact that one calls the crooks among us 'white Jews' is proof that being a Jew implies something bad. Otherwise, one would call crooked Jews 'yellow Christians.' The fact that there are so many 'white Jews' among us proves that the destructive Jewish spirit has already infected wide circles of our population. It is a warning to us that we have to take up the battle against the Jewish world plague everywhere." (Joseph Goebbels). That is why Point 24 of our party program states: "The party battles the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and outside of us."  Argument 5: "Mr. Levi is not a Jew, since he has been baptized!" — Counterargument: As we have already shown, Jewry is not a religion. The Führer pointed that out in a sarcastic manner during the period of struggle [1919-1933] when he said that is was a peculiar sort of religion when one could smell its adherents from a great distance! No, a Jew always remains a Jew. Chaim Herz Bückeberg, better known as "Heinrich Heine," joked: "Are these long noses a kind of uniform that allows the God King Jehovah to recognize his old body guard, even if they have deserted?" "I have no desire to convert the Jews," Martin Luther wrote, "since that is impossible." A Jew remains a Jew. "In case of need, a dose of baptismal water saves both business and Jewry at the same time!" (Adolf Hitler).  Argument 6: "It is true that Mr. Moses Freundenstein is a Jew, but his parents and grandparents lived here. He is one of our old established citizens." — Counterargument: Just as a goat does not become a horse, even if his father and grandfather were in the same stall, a Jew can never become a German, even if his ancestor came to Germany as a peddler in Varus' army [during the Roman era].  Argument 7: "The Jew is a human being too!" — Counterargument: "Of course the Jew is a human being too. None of us has ever doubted it. But a flea is also an animal. But not a very pleasant one. Since a flea is not a pleasant animal, we have no duty to protect and defend it, to take care of it so that it can bite and torment and torture us. Rather, we make it harmless. It is the same with the Jews." {Joseph Goebbels).   Argument 8: "Everything with a human face is equal." — Counterargument: Thirteen years ago, the "Stürmer" carried a cartoon. In it, a miserable pig looked up from his sty to a royal lion. "Everything with an animal face is equal!" But what did the lion growl in reply? "That's what you swine would like to think!"  Argument 9: "Anti-Semitism is only something for idiots!" Counterargument: One no longer hears this lie in National Socialist Germany. But one still reads it in the Jewish emigre press abroad, and Jews whisper it here and perhaps some Jewish lackeys still think that. We smile in response, and note that the Jews have never produced a single creative man, but that all great men in every country have been implacable opponents of the Jews. Some "intellectuals" may be distressed when one doubts their understanding, but we will follow the battle cry against Judah that all of the great men of our past have made!  Argument 10: "Can you live with the uproar and accept responsibility for the misery that the laws of the Third Reich bring to thousands of Jewish families?" — Counterargument: "It is almost a miracle that absolutely nothing has happened to Jews in Germany, rather that only gradually the rights they stole from the Germans in politics and culture have been restored." (Alfred Rosenberg). But even if a few hundred Jewish families in Germany really did have to go hungry, what is that against the many millions of German families that the Jew murdered over the course of centuries through wars, revolutions, and civil strife, not to mention those ruined through usury and fraud. "In the battle between the races, there is no truce. If you are determined finally to defend yourself, German people, then be pitiless!" (Adolf Hitler).

      Well, it's 11:00AM and I just rolled out of bed.  I have a dilemma now as to what I should do:  watch TV, read a book, go to the pool, rent a movie, go to the mall, or just crawl back into bed!  The three best things about being teacher are June, July, and August.  Happy Summer!!!

      “ I hate the Wyoming Valley .”  I’ve said it so many times in the past, but if you asked me why, I don’t think I could give you a good, solid reason.  I think I just say it because I always have.  Yes, that sounds stupid, but we all say and do things for reasons unknown.  I just returned from a brief visit to my hometown.  I like to go home when I have nothing to do so I have time to just drive around.  I love to visit all my old haunts- the places where I grew up, that are full of so many fond memories.   This time, I decided to drive down to my old elementary school- Ss. Peter and Paul.  I parked my car and just walked around, reliving some of my childhood memories.  I sat on the ground near my favorite telephone pole in the asphalt playground.  I walked down to the red box and then to the white box that is now painted red.  I swung around the metal rails and walked to the big kid end of the playground.  These things don’t mean a damned thing to anyone of you, but for some inexplicable reason, they give me an amazing level of comfort.  I visit there often, just to sit and reminisce about the days when everything seemed so much easier.  Days when my parents had all the answers, when my teachers could solve any problem, and I had dreams of marrying a woman and having three great kids and a dog.  The school and its surroundings that give me such a tremendous level of comfort is the same school where now, many years later, I can remember my first homosexual attractions.  It was the beginning of my 7th grade year.  A few of the 8th grade boys came into my classroom to get some books.  They were taller than last year.  Their voices had changed over the summer and for some inexplicable reason, I loved to hear them speak.  I just couldn’t stop looking at them.  I think they were on to me, actually I know they were on to me.  But I was unbelievable clueless.  I didn’t have the benefit of any gay role models in 1992.  ‘Will and Grace’ wasn’t even thought of yet.  I don’t think I even knew what the word “gay” meant.  In 8th grade I remember being very attracted to another boy in my class.  I can use the word attraction now, because I know what it feels like.  Back then, I had no word to use, no point of reference.  I would find myself watching him work during class time.  I couldn’t explain why I was drawn to him.  I just knew it was wrong.  Sneaking peaks at him while we were changing for gym was even worse.  I would grow out of this, I thought.  Hormones will kick in and I’ll actually like girls.  Just give it time.   I don’t hate the Wyoming Valley as much as I hate the 90’s.  The Wyoming Valley wasn’t any worse with gay/lesbian issues than the rest of the world back then.  How many kids felt the same way I did in 1993?  More importantly, how many kids feel the same way in 2004?  Being gay isn’t wrong.  It isn’t a lack of hormones or a result of mom and dad not showing affection to each other.  It isn’t a synapse misfiring in the brain or a choice to live an alternative lifestyle outside the mainstream.  It is just the way we are, and that my friends, is inexplicable.

      I pulled this quote from the NBC10 website.  Someone had posted this comment regarding peace in the Middle East.  I couldn't agree more.  "I knew a man from Israel who told me that the philosophies of many in the Arab world have been shaped for over a thousand years. Walking in and trying to plant our philosophies in countries who have little desire to conform to them is a waste of time. Peace will not happen until the antiquated and petty feuds and beliefs of the past are no longer drummed into new generations of Arabs...and that will not happen in OUR lifetime...and probably not even our childrens."

      Music really is amazing. So many emotions and feelings experienced by so many people.  Once in awhile, I find a song that absolutely feels like it was written for me.  It expresses a feeling, emotion, or state of mind that I could never express with words.  Here are two examples I've been listening to for the past few days.  "Defying Gravity"  from  Wicked , the musical  Something has changed within me  Something is not the same I'm through with playing by the rules Of someone else's game Too late for second-guessing Too late to go back to sleep It's time to trust my instincts Close my eyes: and leap!  I'm through accepting limits 'Cuz someone says they're so Some things I cannot change But till I try, I'll never know! Too long I've been afraid of Losing love I guess I've lost Well, if that's love It comes at much too high a cost!  So if you care to find me Look to the western sky! As someone told me lately: "Ev'ryone deserves the chance to fly!" And if I'm flying solo At least I'm flying free To those who'd ground me Take a message back from me Tell them how I am Defying gravity I'm flying high Defying gravity And soon I'll match them in renown And nobody in all of Oz No Wizard that there is or was Is ever gonna bring me down!  "Not the Boy Next Door"  from  The Boy from Oz   Comin' home used to feel(my way is still) so good I'm a stranger now in my neighborhood I've seen the world at a faster pace And I'm comin' now from a diff'rent place  Though I may look the same way to you Underneath there is somebody new  I am not the boy next door I don't belong like I did before Nothin' ever seems like it used to be You can have your dreams, but you can't have me  I can't go back there anymore 'Cause I am not the boy next door  You've been savin' (all) those souvenirs,  Faded photographs from my(our) foolish years We made plans, but they're wearin' thin And they won't work out 'cause I don't(won't) fit in  And those mem'ries will just weigh me down 'Cause I got no place to keep 'em uptown  I am not the boy next door I don't belong like I did before Nothin' ever seems like it used to be You can have your dreams, but you can't have me  I can't go back there anymore 'Cause I am not the boy next door  And I'm sorry for just bein' me But if you'd look past the past you could see

      Just when I think I know everything there is to know about the moron who runs my school, I find out something new and dumber about him.  Today we had the first practice for the "promotional exercises" formally known as 8th grade graduation.  Dear old Carl has been in the district for nine years,  which means he has done this promotional thing nine times.  I am new to the district.  This is my FIRST ceremony.  I found it ridiculous that he refused to make a single decision today regarding anything!  Instead he kept referring questions to me or another non-tenured teacher in the room.  What the fuck is that?  The man is unable to make a decision!  He's the freaking principal- thats his job- to MAKE DECISIONS.  Through his ball-less act of weasling out of even the smallest decision, he covers his own ass and throws the rest of us to the lions.  Tell me again why I want to work here again??????!?!!?!???!?!

      For some reason, my ADHD seems to kick into high gear when I enter a movie theater.  Maybe its the large supply of popcorn or the strange synthetic butter substance that flows from a pump near the snack bar.  Regardless of the cause, I bounced from one end of the theater to the other.  Garland and Paula had to experience this hightened state of activity TWICE this weekend.   On Friday, we went to see  Saved! , a satirical look at evangelical Christians and their less than Christian views. This movie was teeming with awesome one-liners!    Hilary Faye:  I mean honestly, you're not born a gay, you're born again. Prayer works, it's been medically proven.  Hilary Faye: Mary, turn away from Satan. Jesus, he loves you.  Mary: You don't know the first thing about love.  Hilary Faye: [Hilary throws a Bible at Mary] I am *filled* with Christ's love!  Mary:  It's not a weapon, you idiot!  Mary:  When Jesus closes a door, he opens a window- for you to jump out of.  There are many more, but I can't remember them!!!!!  On Sunday we went to see  Shrek 2 .  This was also funny and very well done.  There was an asshole sitting in front of us, but what can you do?  Once again, I was bouncing around, feeling up Paula, and annoying the shit out of Garland (he wasn't feeling well).  I have to be an  adult  way to often.  It's nice to be an annoying little shit everyone once and again.

       West Side Story   My 7th Graders and I had a very mature discussion today about prejudice.  We had just finished watching "West Side Story" one of my favorite movies. I was reminded of a song I sang as Lt. Joe Cable in my high school's production of  South Pacific  entitled "You've got to be Taught"  You've got to be taught To hate and fear, You've got to be taught From year to year, It's got to be drummed In your dear little ear You've got to be carefully taught.  You've got to be taught to be afraid Of people whose eyes are oddly made, And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade, You've got to be carefully taught.  You've got to be taught before it's too late, Before you are six or seven or eight, To hate all the people your relatives hate, You've got to be carefully taught!   My students completely agreed that some things taught by parents can negatively effect or skew a child's view of the world.  These negative influences are so far reaching.  Publications like the Catholic Standard and Times don't help alleviate negative influences for our young people.  This week's CS & T installment- Treatment and Prevention of Homosexuality.  I'm thinking that Part 5 will be- Eradicating the Homosexuals from Earth, followed by Part 6- Creating the Master Race.  A Quote from a friend:  No American should ever live in fear due to blatant discrimination and inequity. I hope that the day comes when every person is judged solely by their competency and character while simultaneously being accepted (and there is a difference between tolerance and acceptance)for their sexual persuasion.

       Broadway Do's and Don'ts   These suggestions will make the theater experience more enjoyable for everyone.  DO arrive at the theater before the show is scheduled to begin.  DON'T arrive at your seats 15 minutes after the performance has begun and then give the rest of your row dirty looks.  DO clap along to up-beat songs, especially if the performer starts the clapping.  DON'T clap along to ballads such as "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"  DO expose your children to the excitement of live theatre when they are old enough to sit through it.  DON'T bring your 18 month old to a performance and then refuse to remove the screaming monster during quiet, emotion filled moments!  DO whisper questions/comments quietly to your neighbor at an appropriate time.  DON'T yell to your friend two rows above you at any time!  DO bring candy/snacks into the theater such as Dots or Life Savers.  DON'T unwrap your loud peppermints/cough drops in the middle of the freaking performance.  DO bring a cell phone or pager into the theater set on the silent mode.  DON'T answer a phone call in the middle of a performance!  Yes, I have actually experienced all the DON'Ts at some point!  Coming soon... What the hell happened to common sense??

       Graduation Over Kill   Pre-school Graduation  Kindergarten Graduation  5th Grade Graduation  DARE Graduation  8th Grade Graduation  High School Graduation  College Graduation  Hi- can you say ridiculous?? Do we really need to have seven or more graduations before we are 22 years of age???  I think not!  I only see two graduations on that list that matter:  high school and college.  Every other one is needless, over the top garbage designed to make PARENTS feel good about themselves.  Now I know some of you are saying, "But you'll feel differently when you have children."  BULLSHIT.  I will gladly give you the names of at least 12 teachers who are parents who feel exactly the same way (my own parents included).  A Graduation cememony should mean something.  It should mark the monumental passage from one stage of life to the next.  Pre-school to Kindergarten doesn't fit the bill.  Parents really need to dry up and stop taking themselves so damned seriously!

       Reagan's Passing   I was having difficulty falling asleep last night.  For some strange, unexplainable reason, I was thinking about the death of Ronald Reagan.  I know, I know-- the nemesis of the working class-- the arrogant diplomat-- the king of trickle down economics.  Knowing all this, I still couldn't help thinking about him and actually feeling bad.  I don't like death- anyone's death.  My emotions are strong: happiness, anger, fear, sadness, etc.  I feel them to an extreme.  I feed off the emotions, positive or negative, from the people around me.  Death almost always creates a feeling of sadness and helplessness.  Even when I don't know the deceased, I can feel the emotions of their loved ones.  I feel that tremendous pain and the giant hole that has been torn into their hearts.  I feel that overwhelming sense of helplessness and longing for better, happier days.    The Nightly News with Tom Brokaw started by sympathetic feelings yesterday.  They showed a video clip of Nancy Reagan slowly placing her cheek on the top of Ronald's casket.  A minister stood overhead, his hand on her shoulder.  I started to cry.  Me, the guy who normally doesn't care about anything started to cry.  She just looked so frail and so deflated.  The man that she was married to for over 52 years was gone.  I can't imagine what that must REALLY feel like.   Thousands of people have filed by the casket in the last two days, many crying or looking completely despondent.  I still think that as President he was an ass who did more harm than good.  But I just can't help feeling badly.  Like him or not, America lost an important political figure Saturday afternoon.  What's even sadder is that he probably didn't even recognize his wife of 52 years as he lay dying.  I put up a stalwart, emotionless facade to the general public.  That facade quickly comes tumbling down when I see someone hurting or suffering.  I may get said or I may get angry.  I want to fix what hurts, to alleviate their pain.  I want THEM to fix what hurts.  It's so frustrating that so much of the time; people can't fix their pain, or worse, refuse to fix their pain.  I'm not talking only about physical or mental anguish, but the everyday little things as well:  a job you hate but continue to work at, a family member you can't stand, but tolerate under the guise of "keeping the peace", an injustice you see but refuse to correct, or a secret you keep deep inside in order to stay employed.    Take a stand, alleviate the pain, live life to its fullest.    Easier said than done?

       My New Toy   I got a new cell this weekend.  Something new to play with during boring homilies!  It's a Motorola V300 Camera Phone with plenty of bells and whistles.  I've been taking pictures of completely random things for the last 3 days.  My ring tone is a hi-fi version of "Copacabana."  The wallpaper is a picture of a frozen margarita complete with lime slice.  I can also use this phone when I go to Paris.  It's going to take me a few days to figure out how to do everything.  I'm up for the challenge.   The Retirement Dinner that wouldn't end   Yesterday I attended the retirement dinner of my first principal, Larry Fieber.  I've only worked for two principals, but it’s easy to see that Larry was a phenomenal administrator.  There were approximately 300 people in attendance yesterday.  For some reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to have 13 speakers.  Each speaker felt a need to yammer for at least five minutes.  My ADD was kicked into high gear during the 3.5-hour program.  Teachers saw Larry as the good, the bad, and the ugly. I didn't agree with some of his decisions, especially when they affected my friends.  All in all, I can only hope to have pricipals who are half the administrator Larry was. He worked hard to effect change in the lives of each of his students- thousands over his 32-year career.  Larry Fieber is certainly someone to emulate and look up to.   I played in a jazz combo during the cocktail hour.  Jazz scares me- one of the few styles of music that stops me dead in my tracks.  It's not that I don't like jazz, it's just that I have had very limited exposure and experience with it.  It's a problem that many classically trained musicians face.  We spend so much time mastering the classical style (which we rarely perform after college) that other important and worthy styles and genres are pushed to the side.  I'll probably continue playing with this combo during the summer.  We have gigs lined up at the Officer's Club at Dover AFB.  Men in uniform- YUM :-)

      I work and interact with many people each day of my life.  Whether it be teachers at school, students in my classes, or adults in my choir, I have had the opportunity to observe and relate to people in a variety of settings.  In my opinion, there are two personality types we fall into.  Which one do you fall into?  Is one necessarily better than the other?  Type I  This kind of person is content with life and is generally seen as passive.  The status quo is completely acceptable.  He/she is terribly afraid to question authority or the way of doing things.   They prefer to blend in with the crowd and not make a fuss.   They will avoid confrontation at all costs, even if the result is detrimental.   This avoidance is frequently masked as “compromise” even though a compromise is not present.  Thoughts and emotions are kept deep inside to avoid “ruffled feathers” or hurt feelings.   By avoiding underlying emotions and feelings, more problems are created.   People with type I personalities are frequently perceived as the “followers.”  These people see no need to personally affect change in their lives or society as a whole.    “It’s just the way I am.” “I can’t believe you just said that!” “Things will work themselves out.”  Type II  This kind of person is always searching for more and can be seen as “hands-on” or aggressive.  The status quo is constantly questioned.  He/she is not afraid to question authority especially if he/she believes an authority figure is mistaken.  This kind of person strongly believes that there is a better way of doing things and is not afraid to experiment and make mistakes.  He/she is often the center of attention, either purposely or by circumstance.  Many times, these people are seen as “attention seekers” because they refuse to act in a manner consistent with “established behaviors.”  Although confrontation is not relished, he/she can see the need for disagreements and will not shy away from them.  Thoughts and emotions are readily shared with the general public even if they are not mainstreamed or popular.   People with type II personalities frequently assume leadership positions.  This type of person feels compelled to affect change in his/her personal life and society as a whole.   “I don’t care if that’s the way you’ve always done it!” “How can you tolerate him/her when you know he/she is out of line?”

       Last Concert!   Tonight I had my last concert of the school year.  It is such a wonderful feeling to be done at last!  I can basically coast through the rest of the year without much to worry about.  My 8th graders will sing one song at their promotion ceremony, aka waste of freaking time, but other than that, my feet will be up on my desk.    I went back and read my posts from my busy time a few weeks ago.  It's hard to believe that its all in the past now.  Time really does fly by so quickly!  I'm trying to enjoy more of my life and career  as it happens .  Pretty soon, I'll be retired sitting on my couch asking where it all went.  The present is so important- not yesterday, not tomorrow, but what I'm doing right now.  Interesting rambling thoughts of a middle school music teacher.

      Wicked vs. Avenue Q   I recently saw arguably two of the best shows on Broadway.&nbsp; Although both are very good in their own way, I believe that Wicked rises above all other shows.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Tony voters felt differently than I and many other Broadway buffs, voting Avenue Q the Best Musical of 2004.&nbsp;  Using the elements of a musical that I teach my 7th graders, I am going to attempt to explain why Wicked is the better show.    Music-  &nbsp;   The score of Wicked is phenomenal.&nbsp; People from every walk of life can feel the tremendous aesthetic moments that the music creates.&nbsp; The Act I finale, "Defying Gravity", is so intense that&nbsp;it left tears in my eyes.&nbsp; My entire body was one giant goose bump.&nbsp; This score also boasts some very melodic duets- "As Long as You're Mine"&nbsp; & "For Good."&nbsp; Great care and attention was given to creating harmonies that both show off the singers' voices and effectively represent the emotion of the songs.&nbsp; Schwartz also uses many complex and interesting harmonic progressions in the score, in addition to the requisite key changes.&nbsp; Frequently, the music takes a sudden turn to harmonies and progressions that leave the listener taken aback- in a good way.&nbsp; The lyrics throughout serve to advance the plot and foreshadow important events in the show.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although a different element- the orchestrations perfectly compliment each and every song.&nbsp;   The score of Avenue Q leaves much to be desired.&nbsp; The songs follow simple, run of the mill chord&nbsp;progressions.&nbsp; At no point did any one musical section jump out at me.&nbsp; However, the lyrics&nbsp;of the songs make the show what it is.&nbsp; With songs like "Everyone's a Little Bit Racist" & "The Internet is for Porn", the audience can see the immense amount of time that went into creating lyrics that worked.&nbsp; I don't see any of these songs being performed outside the context of the show.&nbsp; Although cute, staying power is sorely lacking.    Plot-   The plot of Wicked delves into the Land of Oz before Dorothy landed.&nbsp; The central characters are Galinda (later Glinda) and Elphaba (later the Wicked Witch of the West).&nbsp; A complex web of characters intertwines to explain why one character was deemed good and the other "wicked."&nbsp; The book author did an amazing job of bringing in many characters from the 'Wizard of Oz'.&nbsp; The plot has many twists and turns and isn't all that predictable.&nbsp; This story shows how a point of view deeply skews the real history of a time and place.   The plot of Avenue Q deals with a group of 20 somethings who haven't found their "purpose".&nbsp; They become good friends and attempt to help each other through the difficult circumstances of everyday life such as finding a job, finding a partner, coming to terms with sexuality, and settling down.&nbsp; A variety of social issues are tackled using puppets and very enjoyable (sometimes true) off- colored jokes and puns.&nbsp; Other than the $10 million donation, the plot doesn't create too many surprises.    Costumes-    The costumes from Wicked are very colorful, imaginative, and original to say the least.&nbsp; Although the costumer used The Wizard of Oz as a starting point, there are considerable changes to many of the characters.&nbsp; Particularly striking were the costumes used during scenes in the Emerald City.&nbsp; It's amazing what can be done with the color green!&nbsp; The costumes throughout are very ornate with great detail given to every last stitch.   Walking down the streets of New York City one can see the costumes of Avenue Q.&nbsp; The puppeteers are dressed similar to the puppet characters.&nbsp; Other than the wedding dress that lit up and sparkled, nothing stood out as imaginative or extraordinary.    Scenery-    Wicked has a huge set in a huge theater.&nbsp; As soon as you walk into the theater, a giant map of the land of Oz hangs as the curtain.&nbsp; A large dragon covers the proscenium arch, staring menacingly at the audience.&nbsp; Both sides of the arch have been converted into lighting stands and a series for balconies and passageways used by the cast through the performance.&nbsp; Onstage scenery is also very elaborate and changes frequently.&nbsp; Special effects include Glinda's flying bubble and real flying monkeys.   The scenery of Avenue Q does not change throughout the course of the performance.&nbsp; Small compartments open to reveal individual apartments, but the main scenery stays in place from start to finish.&nbsp; Although this is effective, more varied scenery could have been incorporated into the show.    Dancing-  &nbsp;   Neither of these shows is '42nd Street' but... The choreography in Wicked begins during the orchestral overture and continues throughout many scenes in the show.&nbsp; Large dance numbers serve to compliment the score.&nbsp;   The dancing in Avenue Q is very minimal.&nbsp; Choreography is mainly used during the final refrains and rarely involved the full company.&nbsp; &nbsp;   So there you have it!&nbsp; I encourage everyone to see both of these shows and weigh into the debate.&nbsp; Both shows have their strengths, but I strongly feel that Wicked comes out ahead of Avenue Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      The Federal Marriage Amendment was  urlLink defeated  in the Senate today.  This controversial amendment would have been the first in the Constitution that would have LIMITED the rights of many Americans.  It's good to know that I still have a chance of one day getting married in this country, with all the rights and priveleges that heterosexual couples currently enjoy.  Although the FMA may appear again in Congress, my rights are safe for now!  On another note- Rick Santorum is an ass.  This is what he had to say shortly before the defeating vote today:  "I would argue that the future of our country hangs in the balance because the future of marriage hangs in the balance.  Isn't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and defending marriage?"   His is a point of view that I refuse to accept or even consider.  I firmly believe that a point of view or an opinion can be wrong.  Santorum's views are a perfect example.

      WOW- what an amazing trip!  For those of you that don't know, just returned from a week long vacation in the gay city of Paris, France.  I had a fabulous time, ate some delicious food, and saw many amazing sights.  Let me first tell you what learned while abroad:  1) The smell of fresh produce and body odor combine to create a most intriguing fragrance.  2) Bulls eyes are to hunters as crosswalks are to French drivers.  3) If you stare at a Frenchman like a deer in headlights, he/she will almost always start to speak English.  4) The human body does not do well with a 6-hour time change!  5) French perfume is very strong and smells like my grandmother.  6) To the French, aesthetics are more important that the bottom-line (I'll elaborate in a future post).  7) French wine can get you very drunk.  8)  2-year olds should never be allowed on a trans-Atlantic flight.  Never.  (On the flight over, we were unlucky enough to have a brat who SCREAMED for over  four hours  while mommy dearest did nothing- no I'm really not exaggerating- I timed the little monster).  9) Europeans dress very, very well.  10) Paris is more beautiful than any US city I have ever visited (goes back to that aesthetics vs. bottom line thing)  More to come soon!

      We needed a study to figure this out????????  "Young gay and bisexual men experience higher rates of anti-gay violence and harassment than older gay men, according to a new study released Tuesday. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), studying gay men aged 18 to 27 found that men under 21 experienced the highest levels of violence and harassment.   Additionally, in what researchers deemed "one of the most alarming" findings, men who reported experiencing anti-gay violence and harassment were twice as likely to report serious thoughts about suicide."

      I am not the best listener. When a friend or colleague has a problem, I find myself becoming agitated and annoyed. It's not that I am bored with their problem that causes me to become apathetic, it is the fact that I feel absolutely helpless. As an acquaintance of mine said in her blog, men like to fix problems, they can't just sit and listen. I have so much trouble listening to a problem that I am completely unable to fix. I am sometimes perceived as uncaring or callus, but that is not at all the case. With all my being, I want to alleviate the pain or stress, but so much of the time I am not in the position to do ANYTHING. Is wanting to help a friend a bad thing? Is wanting to erase that problem something that I should apologize for?  I have this terrible gift that causes me to feel emotions very strongly. The problem is that I don't' only feel my emotions- I am very attuned to the emotions of those around me. If I get a phone call from a friend who is angry at work, I almost instantly become angry, usually more than they are. Likewise, if someone very saddened talks to me, I feel that emotion also. How am I supposed to just sit an listen when I feel the same way they do????? Should I learn to block out all that feeling and just sit complacently??? I don't think that is possible!

      I have been told my many people that I have an argumentative personality. Some people have seen this as an asset while others have seen it as a personality flaw. I tend to think that my argumentative personality has served me well, and see it as a positive personality trait.  I wasn't always so willing to stand up for what I believe to be the truth and let my voice be heard loudly. Growing up in Wilkes-Barre, I was very much the opposite of who I am today. I tended to quietly blend into the crowd, only speaking when necessary (I know, so hard to believe). During this time, I was struggling with my sexuality and in hindsight, depression.  Things began to change during my freshman year of college at Wilkes University. At the beginning of the spring semester, a favorite professor of mine who had been on the faculty for over 20 years was fired. The circumstances behind his dismissal were very secretive. The Administration refused to talk truthfully with the students in the music department. I started to speak out against the professor's dismissal. I organized rallies, designed a t-shirt worn by most of the music students every Friday, and refused to accept anything but the truth from the President of the University. I was doing what I knew was right, even though the odds were stacked against me.  Towards the end of April, another professor in the music school began to receive death threats. It is important to note that this professor was a staunch supporter of the University. Because of my outspoken comments and actions against the university's President and Administration, I was wrongfully accused of making the threats. The Dean of Students, usually a person protecting students' rights on campus, personally escorted me to his office one day. Once there, I was questioned by a police detective for over 2 hours, illegally searched, and threatened with arrest. The message from the university was clear: Keep quiet, if you know what's good for you. Something changed within me that day. I did exactly what they didn't want me to do- I contacted the local media.  The following day, a rally for students' rights was staged on the River Commons across the street from the music building. As university administrators looked on, I told my story to the crowd of students and the reporter from The Times Leader. There was no turning back now. I think this was the only moment in my life when I was absolutely terrified. My only consolation was the fact that I knew I was doing the right thing.  The headline on page 2 the next day read, "Music student hits sour note with search, questioning". My story was out there for all of NEPA to read. The university released a memo saying that they refused to harbor individuals suspected of committing a crime (this made me look really good). No charges were ever formally filed against me, as there was no evidence whatsoever, besides my outspoken behavior, linking me to the threats. To this day, I have no idea who made the threats.  From that experience on, I refused to be led blindly by anyone. I challenged a statement I believed to be incorrect. I asked for proof, facts, and figures. People don't like to be challenged. Many people think they are the master's of their field, when in fact they are not.  The bottom line is that I refuse to apologize for questioning the status quo, for making people rise above their current standing. Being argumentative has gotten me where I am today- wonderful friends, a great teaching and church job, and the feeling that I am NOT like everyone else! Yes, it may have its drawbacks, but over all, I would rather be an outspoken, argumentative leader, than a soft-spoken, spineless follower.

      Yes I know, it certainly is a morbid topic, but it happens to be on my mind right now. No, I have no plans on killing myself or any close friends. There is that secret list, but I digress.  I was watching a 'Law and Order' episode just now on television. This particular episode dealt with a female doctor who helped people take their lives. She actually had a web site called "Catching the Train" where she was the conductor. As the conductor, she gave ideas and suggestions to people on the best ways to kill themselves. The doctor was arrested and tried because she supplied a patient with insulin. The patient used the insulin to overdose thereby killing herself.  This brings up an interesting argument. Should people be able to assist suicides? Or better yet, if someone is suffering with a painful, debilitating disease, should he or she have the opportunity to end his/her life?  I was brought up with the belief that all life is sacred, from womb to tomb, sperm to worm. For many years I bought into this belief that humans shouldn't play God. Then I grew up and started to think for myself, and began to question what I was  told  to belief. Abortion was the first to go. If I was a woman, raped one night on the way to my car, I would not want to carry that child. If after getting pregnant, I found out that carrying the child to term would kill me, I would not keep that child. The bottom line is that is is not my body and therefore, not my decision. Do I think that abortion should be used time after time as a form of contraception? Absolutely not. I just feel that there are instances in a woman's life that aren't always cut and dry like the men who make laws (and run the church) would have you think.  Now I imagine someone with end-stage cancer, in terrible pain, unable to eat or move around on their own. This person is going to die, there is no doubt. If this person asked me to help them end his/her life, who am I to say no? Who am I to say that this terrible suffering has a reason and a meaning? Who am I to preach that God will take you "when it's your time?" My God is a loving caring God. He doesn't want any of us to suffer or be in excrutiating pain for "the greater glory?" I think my God would want me to help. And I would.

      It seems that the intelligence used by The Homeland Security Department, headed by Tom Ridge, was somewhere between two and three years old!  Ridge swears that raising the threat level in Washington D.C, New York City, and New Jersey was NOT politically motivated.   Hmmm.  I just love when politicians underestimate the intelligence of the American people.  I suppose it's just coincidence that Bush and Kerry are neck and neck in just about every poll.  If this information was so credible, so important, why the fuck did the moron sit on it for 2-3 years!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  This is just another attempt by the Bush Administration to strike fear into the hearts of Americans, thereby giving him a few points in the polls.  Does he really think we're that stupid??  Gotta love Republicans!

      I am doing my part to warn the world NOT to see "The Village."  This new M. Night Shyamalan movie is a waste of money.  Like his previous movies, the plot takes a wicked twist, but in the absolute WRONG direction.  I loved "The Sixth Sense."  I was an incredible movie, well acted, well written.  It seems that Mr. Shyamalan is now more concerned with a ridiculous plot twist than producing a movie of good quality.  I won't spoil this waste of time for you on the off chance you'd like to throw away $9.  If you want to know exactly why it sucked delapidated goat balls, I'll be more than happy to tell you via email.

      I haven't blogged in quite a while so I have quite a bit on my mind. I'm just going to ramble for a bit, bear with me if you can!   John Kerry   I watched most of the Primetime speeches during the Democratic National Convention this past week. Unfortunately, I really wasn't impressed with most of them. Speakers like Howard Dean were so watered down- "...he was like a pit bull, chained to a fence, wearing a muzzle." I was, however, dully impressed with the next President of the United States, John Kerry. I liked what he had to say. He effectively outlined what he will do as President. We got to know about him, his life, and his values (I really hate that word, but I can throw it around like the best of them). For the first time in my life, I actually felt  proud  to be an American. I actually began to understand what  patriotism  is all about. Hell, I wanted to go out and buy a damned flag (NOT a pride flag). Not to sound corny, but I felt like Hope really was on the way. I'm not going to have to sit around for 4 years wondering what rights I will be stripped of next.   Children   Oh where to begin! They are everywhere. They are loud. They scream they cry they whine. Damn that sounds a lot like me when I'm tired, but I digress. Over the course of my week at the beach, I ran into many screaming children of varying ages: on the beach, in restaurants, on the boardwalk, at the rest stop. My parents (and I) are of the belief that if your child is screaming, you should TAKE IT THE HELL HOME!! Not later, not in five minutes, IMMEDIATELY. Now I mention my parents because it has been said that I have no clue what childrearing is like because I do not have a child. This may in fact be true. My parents on the other hand, have raised three seemingly well-adjusted children. My mom is the first one to speak up and suggest that the child either be muzzled or moved away from the current locale. I think of children as second hand smoke. Go ahead and smoke all you want, but keep it away from me when I'm trying to enjoy myself.   George Bush    ...is a hateful, divisive, bible-thumping, Texas ranch living, bad English speaking, dumbass with bad hair. Enough said!    Angels and Demons    Another amazing book by Dan Brown, author of  The DaVinci Code . His books make us take a good, hard look at the Roman Catholic Church and what it is really trying to teach. Although both books are fiction, the main points are terribly accurate. I highly recommend both books to anyone and everyone. It will really make you think twice the next time you walk into church.   The Catholic Church   ... is at it again.  A bishop in Oregon "has published a two-page "affirmation of faith" that requires lay ministers and cantors to accept the church's teachings against same-sex relationships, abortion, contraception and other issues if they want to keep their jobs." If this ever happens in Philadelphia I would have a tough decision to make: resign on principle or let the bastards keep paying me my salary every week while I laugh all the way to the bank!    My Boyfriend   I realize that I love Garland more each passing day. I love spending time with him, even if it's just sitting on the couch watching that fat moron, Tom Ridge talk about threats he really knows nothing about. I don't particularly like leaving him for long periods of time, but what can you do? We are nearing our sixth month anniversary later this week!    My Mom   I am very close to my mother, but not as close as I'd like to be. She is still adjusting to the whole gay thing ( I came out to her in April 2003). Whenever I spend time with her, I can feel the tension between us. No one else can feel that. I desperately want that turmoil to subside, but I realize there's not much I can do except give her the time she needs. It would be nice to be able to talk about Garland more openly and freely with her without fear of her wigging out. Time and patience, time and patience.    Hateful Rappers   There is a rapper out of Jamaica named "Beenie Man". His music instructs listeners to kill gays. No, I'm not kidding. "The music reflects how Jamaican people see it," he said. "I think there are things that are a part of Caribbean culture just like any other culture in the world. Everybody has their way of life. People have beliefs and that comes from who they are. The music come from that." Would people tolerate music that instructed listeners to kill African Americans (Southern Culture) or Jews (German Culture)??? This is just another attempt to rationalize homophobia as something we need to accept. Fuck off!    Spruce Street Singers   ...are singing the National Anthem at a Phillies game on August 9th. It's the ballclub's second annual gay day. Even the Phillies realize the power of the (Gay) almighty dollar!  Well that certainly is enough for now. Amazingly, I have much more that I would like to write. All that will have to wait for another time as I'm very tired and in need of sleep! Have a great week!  urlLink
