      My first day going out to see clients after vacation.  It's strange work do, going to their homes rather than they coming to mine.  But it's the right thing to do, and I'm pleased that I have to adjust to whatever is going on in their lives rather than they adjust to my office.  I can do without the safety and protection sitting in my own space provides.  I prefer to ride the wave of their homes, their environment, their space.  I was given bad directions to a school staffing for one of my clients.  I really lost it getting there: feeling furious in the car, screaming some, feeling totally lost geographically and emotionally.  I'm sure a strong part of my just wanted to be on the "let's play" of vaction and resisted going back to work.  It ended up being a pretty good meeting, resulting in the kid staying in the school, and I pulled it together, thank goodness.  But I really had to work hard to be presentable.  Hopefully, they didn't see that.  Traveling the 50 miles to the school, I thought how in the world do people do it, a regular daily commute.  I heard a story on NPR this morning about people living in Pennsylvania commuting two hours to New York City to work.  I thought that that was crazy enough.  But the story was about how they had to make changes in their lives because of high gas prices.  Yet every one of these idiots, as described in the article, was driving an SUV.  Why on earth do you need an SUV to drive, alone, from PA to NYC?  It's the stupidest thing in the world.  The most wasteful, for sure.  We listeners were supposed to feel sympathetic for them; I felt nothing but disgust!

      This is my gift to myself after returning from a two-week vacation: starting a blog.  Today was an intense day that I managed by keeping my list of things to do low.   Listen to voice-mail and record on my things to do list; call my vacation back-up to confirm that our clients are fine; get through the pile of paper on my desk.  I completed those tasks pretty darn well, to my satisfaction,  but I was  exhausted and stressed, still, at the end of the day.  As I thought about it later, I realized what was missing was any creative act.  I created  nothing  new,  I just made sure everything was in order, the business was still solvent, everyone was ok, new referrals and closed cases were processed.  I could have worked on putting the final touches on the marketing campaign that I'd like to finish and get out the door in the next week, or I could have worked on the website content for the revision.  Then again, I could have taken time at lunch to practice my Ukelele (a baritone), the piano, or the drums.  Instead, I went for a walk, which was also a very worthwhile activity, but, again, not creative.  Now, as I'm creating this, I do wonder what it would be like to be one of my clients running  into this.  I wonder if I'm going to be editing/censoring myself.  Of course, I'd never write directly about any of my clients' lives, but I suspect I'll be addressing the issues raised by my work with them and maybe my reactions to my sessions with them.  I'm more cautious about the latter.  The olympics is on in the background, and I'm sick of the Star Spangled Banner.  I'm sure I'm not alone.  My girls, almost seven-years-old and eight months old, are asleep upstairs though the baby will be back up within a half-hour for a final bottle and diaper change.  The big girl made me furious tonight -- she came in for dinner from playing expecting us to have her friends and their parents over for dinner tonight.  Actually, she'd invited them.  Then she through a huge tantrum, complete with extreme crying.  Yup, even a "parenting expert" like me loses it.  I was so furious, so frustrated.  But I did keep it together and help the kiddo through it, comforted her while she cried, though I'd have preferred to wring her neck.  Still, I've been carring my feelings around all evening, especially after a second break-down by her just before bed.  Writing this has been helpful.  I hope you find it the same, if not interesting.
