      Second day exploring the numbers of abilities of Blogger, I was amazed.  I know that the site was made by  urlLink Stopdesign , so are many of templates. The quality of the templates are superior and great learning tools for CSS layout learners like myself. The coding of the pages are easy to study and edit, and also really professional.  The flexibility is great. The options are complete and easy to add more functionalities due to an open template system. basically it can be a Content Management System if used to its full extend, although i don't know about the restrictions about multiple blogs.  The best thing about it is that it's free, and of course infinite percent better than Xanga.

      Well, well, well,  When I was wondering around on the web (actually, searching around about the delay of  urlLink I-Pod mini  production, I somehow got one by chance), once again I saw a Blog by Blogger. So i thought "Why not? my site isn't ready yet and I'm tired of scripping for websites", so here I am at  urlLink Blogger  writing the first post.     Hope it has the capability to back up the posts and transfer into other services though, or it has a custom skin ability that is very much "do all"... than i'll probably stay on posting.

      This is late at night, my god this will not make any sense.  Thinking is a thing to think about. I've always wondered how each person thinks in their mind. Because for me, thinking in my brain is not as clear, logical, and straight forward as the word "thinking" put it, at least to my understanding and feeling of the word. It is a activity that rarely requires consciousness. For example, when reading a book, ideas of connections to other things flashes in my mind like lightnings strikes of clues. Sometimes the connection down to my brain continued back to the air as my thinking followed through the ideas and made mental notes to my self: to think about the connection.  When I think, I like to dig deep into the ideas. And very frequently I find myself asking question to the line of thinking itself, or the action of thinking itself during the road to farther conclusion of the problem. Often I don't recall a conclusion or final idea triggered by a connection until another connection is made at a future time. Shoot, I think I wrote all these just to let myself think about thinking itself, but human minds are really unexplainable, the logic gets tangled up when I do this sort of thinking. Then again I don't really know if it is "thinking", better way to put it is "brain storming", as to almost to all my thinkings.   add: the above probably fits the the content of a voice recorder.

      During these past two weeks of summer not very many things happened. The summer school just ended which means the beginning of summer vacation for me. This summer I didn't go anywhere far away or out of the country, simply staying home, playing guitar, watching movie, and learning things about art and design and computer, as usual.  Nothing really to log about, but I think the main thing that kept me from writing more is the unclear vision I have for it. OK, basic to the extreme, I'm a student, a designer, and a Chinese-Taiwanese who came to the US. There is a urge to use my native language to write such diarial things as a blog, as a connection to the homeland and the people there. But the things I learned and want to record about almost all happened in English in the real world. This all frustrate me quite a bit, always scratching in the back of my mind. Well, maybe I should create another Chinese based blog? then there is the concern that it would take too much time. Is this a blog for myself? I don't really know. Is writing a diary kind of thing really like this? For now, I'm keeping this as a voice recorder. As for casual posting of day to day life or the more "fun" things, I'll create another blog in the future, in Chinese. These are the plans for now.  I think I'm going to record everything I own that are worth writing down: a collection of DVDs, CDs, MP3s, books, electronics, etc; just to sort them chronologically from now on, a catalog of some sort. Am I too bored? Definitely. Will I keep up? Probably not, but i think it will be useful since I lose things to other people once in a while.  Another plan, hopefully I'll be taking AP Studio Art during this so-called very busy Junior year, so... I'll be uploading art progress.  Oh I almost forgot, and write some real blog entries. Busy, busy, busy.
