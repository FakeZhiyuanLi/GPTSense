      some cds I am listening to at the moment:  The Dandy Warhols - Welcome To The Monkey House Yo La Tengo - Summer Sun Grandaddy - The Sophtware Slump Dave Matthews Band - The Gorge Interpol - Turn On The Bright Lights Silver Ray - Humans The Smallgoods - This Is The Show Greenland - The Prison of Language Purplene - Purplene Ween - Quebec Jim O'Rourke - Insignificance Sigur Ros - Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do  and Bill Hicks - Flying Saucer Tour Vol.1  Just finished reading Love All The People by Bill Hicks. A great book, basically a collection of his recorded shows transcribed interspersed with interviews and letters by the late great man. Highly Recommended. As is American Scream - The Bill Hicks Story by Cynthia True.  Still reading The 12th Planet by Zecharia Sitchin.. lot of information to take in, but nearly there.  Some notable gigs coming up in the next week worthy a look:  International Karate + Laura @ Bar Open, Brunswick St Fitzroy  more on this tomorrow.  My own band SEASON just got back from our first tour interstate playing Newcastle and Sydney shows with the likes of Audiophile, Greenland, The Null Set and Ides of Space. Season's next show is at the launch of the second Wireless Records Compilation which the band have the track 'Into The Light' featured on. Details:  Saturday September 11th @ The Empress, Nicholson Street North Fitzroy. $12 entry for 11 bands. Free compilation cd on entry.

      Welcome to the 'Grand Music for Tiny Souls' blog. There is no real purpose to this other than to perhaps allow you, the few, to be kept in the know of what is going on in my world. My world is MUSIC. I play in bands (Season and Oneironaut). I book shows for bands under the Low Transit Industries label, and I organise tours and one-off shows for bands, some of who are (including past, present and future): Squipplepippy (qld), The Rebel Astronauts (nsw), The Sound Platform (vic), Midstate Orange (vic), The Ca$inos (vic), Tonjip (qld), Laura (vic), The Null Set (nsw), Greyscale (vic), Greenland (nsw), Audiophile (nsw) and Enola Fall (tas). I also organise and have created my own one-off shows such as 'Grand Music for Tiny Souls', 'Drive Quietly On The Bridge' and the Low Transit's 'Beatnik Babies & Mescaline Fashions' Concerts. This is pretty much enough to keep me busy in my free time, and may one day lead to me actually making a living off of this. At this point it is just a drive to create a bit of a community around me with the bands and people I have gotten to know over the last few years. Melbourne is a major centre for music and people know this, and I know this.. and it is not slowing down. In the last two years we have seen the scene grow to an amazingly thriving state. It has always been good.. but it's getting better and better. Every day. What you will see here is basically news of what I am involved in. News, gigs, tours, links, and just things I like and am listening to at the moment. Enjoy your visit, and keep coming back.
