      Okay maybe I am not leaving yet, but there is just no really good lyrics that go, "I am currently in assignment committee and don't know what is happening, but I am praying to God that I will get assigned to Uganda."  If you hear a song like that let me know.  I am moving to SB in July.  I will know about where I am working in a week (or so).  Next week I will be in SB working at Community Covenants Vacation Bible School "Mission Possible."  Come party with me if you are around.  I keep getting asked the questions, "What are you doing?" and "When are you leaving?" and "What is that smell?"  The first two I can answer the third is a personal issue I am working out under doctors supervision :)  I am a literacy specialist. For about 500 people, none of whom read this page, that actually means something.  For those of you who don't know what a literacy specialist is please read the following. A literacy specialist is:  some one who specializes in literacy work ;)   For reals, what I do is help people learn to read and write in their vernacular (or first) language.  Within this job title there are many different jobs including: 1) Work on orthography (that is alphabet reform and codification) 2) Design and review graded curriculum 3) Train teachers and writers 4) Coordinate education efforts by government officials for local needs.  So that is my new job and what I have spent two years preparing for.  As to when I will leave: I hope to leave in September for Uganda.  If I don't get assigned to Uganda then I don't know when I will leave.  Also, my departure is dependent upon having enough:  1) Church support 2) Partnership relationships 3) Financial support  So you may ask the questions "Why do literacy?" and "Who do you work for?" and "If I have to smell you I might as well know why you smell?"  The last one is not so much a question but really trying to get me to address the earlier question, but I will not budge.  The other questions will have to wait until the government unseals those files (my next blog I promise). For now at least maybe you get the horribly trite title of this page. Peace for my homeboys

      Hey every one!  Okay here is the latest information: I leave for Orlando on Saturday. I will be presenting to Wycliffe delegates at an important meeting. I will be back on Tuesday when I hope to start finding a place in Santa Barbara. I am single, a literacy worker, and leaving for another continent in the Fall  :)               Party on Party People.

      So I as most of you know Uganda has invited me to work in literacy.&nbsp; I had several concerns about the assignment, mostly relating to the insanity of a boss who met me and  still  wanted me to work for him.&nbsp; He responded to my questions in his traditional thorough and pensive manner.&nbsp; I appreciated that aspect of his personality when I first met him at Biola.&nbsp; So now I am taking the next steps to move forward in this assignment.&nbsp; I have started the official process of being assigned to Uganda.&nbsp; What this means is that I am waiting for the "To Do" list of activities that need to be accomplished for you all to be rid of me.&nbsp; In all seriousness I am very happy to be here and spend time each day thanking God for the blessings of such supportive family and friends.&nbsp; My "To Do" list will most likely consist of very mundane, tedious, and essential activities like; immunization, setting up contacts, visa requirements, financial support, getting tickets, arranging housing and living for another country.&nbsp; I want to invite any of you who would like to participate in this fairly boring, but very necessary, part of the ministry to let me know.&nbsp; I would love to talk with you about what that kind of partnership would look like.&nbsp; If you are interested in participating financially I can direct you that way as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gory details about my assignment, and the things that need to be done before I leave will be in my newsletter, which shall be published shortly.   Lastly, keeping with the theme of obscure movie references for the title, Robin got the last one (Monty Python's Holy Grail), plus the bonus points!&nbsp;I know it is not who wins or loses, but she is winning :)  I submit today's title for the lightning round, where all the points are worth double. Enjoy the game kids!    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (Hints to be provided in the comments, but only if you're good)

      The committee has met and agreed that I am eligible for both Uganda and Senegal as assignments!&nbsp; This is excellent news and I thank you for your prayers. As I can not be in two places at once, those pesky laws of physics being at work again, I am taking time to respond to the concerns the committee has regarding the Uganda assignment as I believe that this is the direction I am supposed to go.&nbsp; Once the program coordinator responds to the concerns that were raised I feel I will have the information for actually confirming the Uganda-Tanzania Branch as my new place of work. &nbsp;I am looking forward to the opportunity to provide you all with actual projections, including needs for the future. If you have questions about the process of making this decision, or about the assignment details, or what this means with the current problems in Sudan and its consequent overflow into northern Uganda please contact me.  In a somewhat related note please let me know which of the two comment formats you prefer.&nbsp;  Remember comments are your voice in this election year… &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;…sorry, scratch that last thought. I got a little lost CNN is on :)

      As most of you can tell I am still&nbsp; in the learning process of being a missionary.&nbsp; What does that mean I  do  for a living?&nbsp; How do I ask people to be involved?&nbsp; Who do I ask to be involved?&nbsp; What should people do to help me?&nbsp; What help do I need and what help do I want?&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the&nbsp;differences in&nbsp;asking or begging, and how&nbsp;does my pride influencing me in understanding the difference?&nbsp; What this means for you, my  super cool  friends and family, is that I would love to hear from you.&nbsp; What do you think about all of this?&nbsp; What are things that I can do to get you more involved?&nbsp; What information do you need so we can learn together?&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am really excited to be in this stage of my life.&nbsp; I am also really&nbsp;struggling to let go of the "romanticized" past and be thankful for what God has given me, knowing the future is full.&nbsp; I appreciate the time, prayer,&nbsp;and love you have shared as I go through this time of growing and learning.  In keeping with the leaning theme I have revamped my comments section.&nbsp; The old&nbsp;comment section is still there for those who are registered bloggers, but a new section is present so those of you who are not interested in registering can comment with an identity.&nbsp; I hope that this makes the Blog a little more&nbsp;user friendly.&nbsp;The old format will soon follow the way of the dinosaur.&nbsp; Sorry&nbsp;for the brief interruption of emotionalism this blog will return to its usual sardonic tone shortly.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lastly, I still have not heard about my assignment and like to think I am keeping an okay attitude about it.&nbsp; Your prayers in this time mean a lot, thanks.

      ... is good news. Okay, I think the whole title into the body is getting a little bit over done. However, there is no information to report.  I am getting a little bit anxious and have appreciated hearing from all of you.  I am happy to report that the intramural basketball team I am part of won again last night in a tight contest 48 to 45.  It was very exciting.  Unfortunately the general mayhem is on hold for now.  On a more serious note I am hoping to hear soon from the assignment committee.  Please keep my mental/emotional state in prayer as it is hard for me to stay focused on God's timing.  Instead I feel anxious and unmotivated.  Thanks for all your support and prayers, I will keep updating this page.  I know you are all dying to know how Wednesday's game turns out.  As always for those of you in SB I am around and would enjoy talking with you about my literacy work.  Today's issue to discuss: Whether it is better to burn out or fade away? Post away...

      ... really, I thought it was a noun? Okay I took that from a cartoon I saw in a Newspaper once.  The humor that linguists find amusing is fairly lame, sorry to inflict it on you.  The reason for the title is that I am currently waiting to hear where I have been assigned and it has taken over a week longer than expected.  So I am learning patience the only way it is taught, by having to wait.  As soon as I know I will post it amid shouts of jubilation! Until then post your comments questions or recommendations for this site, I check it daily.

      The title has nothing to do with today's blog, but as I just move to Santa Barbara I was feeling like "givin' da shout out."  So I am now in Santa Barbara, and I hope that those of you who are reading this have received my e-mail that my update information is available here. I still have not heard where I will be assigned.  To return to the questions asked in my last blog I would like to direct people to Wycliffe's web site on literacy at http://wycliffe.org/literacy/home.htm There are many stories and a lot of information about literacy work that is available there.  Okay,  "Why I do literacy"                   by Ryan O'Sullivan There are many reasons to do literacy work.  I first wanted to be involved with minority people groups in 1996.  I was interested in serving minority peoples who are consistently disenfranchised.  My area of study as an undergraduate was Communications.  I specialized in inter-group communication and learned as much as I could about group dynamics, identity, communications (of course), and conflict.  As I studied, I came to the conclusion that literacy (education in general) is a key component for minority communities, most of who don't know the national language, to no longer be exploited.  As I became involved with Wycliffe Bible Translators I realized that the work of Bible translation does not end with translation, but with education.  The more I learned the more I became certain that literacy work is a way to serve these linguistic minority communities, both Christian and non-Christian, by inviting them into the literate world.  Literacy skills are essential for survival in the modern literate world. There are fewer and fewer "unreached" places through globalization. Working within a people group, respecting their traditions and cultural heritage, and providing literacy through appropriate cultural models of learning can help intellectually inoculate communities from the negative effects of globalization, and provide them with the opportunity to interact with the larger world on more equitable terms.  For those people who are Christians it opens up the whole world of the Bible, allows for dynamic church growth, discipleship, and spiritual maturity.  For those who are not Christians it is an act of service that allows us the authenticity of sharing a Gospel that proclaims “the greatest shall serve the least” and a Messiah who stoops down so far as to wash our feet.  I think that sums up my position on literacy work.  If you would like to discuss this further please contact me, through E-mail, or phone.  As you can probably tell I get pretty excited about this stuff.   Stay tuned for more exciting updates.  Also, if you have questions (non-body odor related) please feel free to use the comments or the e-mail provide to contact me.
