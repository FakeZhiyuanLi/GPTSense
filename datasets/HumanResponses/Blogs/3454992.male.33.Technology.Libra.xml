                                                        Over on Frank Smith&#8217;s blog I found  urlLink this post  on Peter Laughner&#8217;s review of Lou Reed&#8217;s 1976 album &#8220;Coney Island Baby&#8221;. I agree with Frank that the review is, perhaps, &#8220;the   greatest piece of rock criticism ever written&#8221;, but, unlike Frank, Coney Island Baby is   not   one of my favourite Lou albums. I did, however, recently purchase on eBay a magazine advertisement from the launch of the album, but only because I think the title track is one of Lou&#8217;s best songs which is, as  urlLink Mark Deming from AllMusic  has said, &#8220;a song about love and regret that was as sincere and heart-tugging as anything the man has ever recorded&#8221;. The last line of the song and album, &quot;You know I'd give the whole thing up for you,&quot; grabs me by the short and curlies every time.              &nbsp;         Back to Laughner&#8217;s review. He suggests at the end, that if Lou was serious about the last line, he should do exactly that and stop making records. I&#8217;m personally glad he didn&#8217;t, as much of my inspiration today comes from Lou&#8217;s songs and his approach to his craft in the last 40 years. Perhaps, although I&#8217;m sure Lou would deny it, reviews like this one and the catalogue of reviews from Lester Bangs, may have fired Lou to keep going when many of his contemporaries either died, burned out, or started writing pop songs? Although I find much of his work hit and miss, when he hits, he really hits. It&#8217;s worth the wait. I would love to write songs with that honesty, that sense of poetry.

                                  For those of you paying attention (and I know that is a limited audience at this juncture), this is my fourth (or fifth? Even I&#8217;ve lost  interest  count) blog URL in two years. The reason why I moved from  urlLink http://blogs.msdn.com/cameronreilly  will become apparent in future posts. In the meantime, please be patient with my holding pattern&#8230;
