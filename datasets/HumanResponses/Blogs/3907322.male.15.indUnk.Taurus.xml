       for my success picture i chose a picture of a graduation gown.  i chose this because you achieved something you probably thought  you couldnt. it also shows you worked hard to&nbsp;get where you are  now. this picture symbolizes&nbsp; success,hard working and giving  it 100%.

        MANY QUESTIONS SURFACED UP,SUCH AS WHAT COLLEGE     WILL I ATTEND,HOW WILL I PAY, AND WHAT WILL I DO IN     THE FUTURE? SOME OF THESE ANSWERS ARE EASILLY ANSWERED,     BUT SOME ARE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. I WANT TO BE AN     ARCHITECT, BUT I DONT KNOW WHAT SCOOL CAN OFFER      ME ARCHITECTURAL CLASSES OR A GREAT ART CLASS     OR EVEN A COMPUTER GRAPHICS CLASS.IM HOPING I CAN      GET A SCHOLARSHIP FOR ANYTHING (I DONT WANT TO ASK     MY PARENTS FOR MONEY AND I DONT WANT TO GET A PART TIME      JOB AND JUGGLE COLLEGE AND A SCHOOL EVERY DAY).     WILL I MAKE IT IN THIS WORLD OR WILL I CRUMBLE UNDERNEATH     ALL THIS STRESS AND PRESURE?ANOTHER UNANSWERABLE      QUESTION. I THINK IT DEPENDS ON IF YOU DO IT TO THE FULL     EXTENT AND ALWAYS GIVE IT 100%&nbsp;,OTHER WISE YOU WILL FAIL      HORRIBLY IN LIFE. ITS A SAD TRUTH.AS A&nbsp;CURIOUS STUDENT,I     CRAVE FOR KNOLEDGE AND ANSWERS. THIS INCLUDES ANSWERS     TO THESE QUESTIONS.BLAST HELPS ME BECAUSE IT PREPARES      ME FOR COLLEGE BY TEACHING ME VALUABLE SKILLS.       &nbsp;

      the last time you saw me i was a wreck, the last time you saw me i was a mess, the last time you saw me i was in pain, the last time you saw me you didnt help, the last time you saw me you laughed, the last time you saw me you hurt me, the last you saw me was my last day on earth, now the next time you see me ill be in a coffin burried underground, and that will be the last day youll see me.
