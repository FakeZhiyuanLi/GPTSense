      i dont know why i have them, i get depressed almost every night. its not over realisticly important things normaly and ive never had to resort to anything outside of myself. Now i feel like i must so i wont accidentaly spill my stupid thoughts to others. right now i wonder why i am so depressed even though i know, yet i dont. i bet my subconsiouse knows but wont tell me a thing. whats going through my mind so ergint i must say something? dani... my girl friend, the one i suposedly love and suposedly loves me... she says she loves me, heck, she says she loves me more than i love her. i dont beleave that, i used to becouse she would always be so good to me but recently shes been treating my badly. she makes fun of me  with her friends... infront of my face... she yells at me then says shes not yelling, and then says i shouldnt be worried or sorry even though they are constantly making me feel like im screwing up! they yell at me and act like their my friends. i feel like they treat me like a bitch, i hate that, like almost everyone does. i guess its just in my aura "hey im a stupid little runt, pick on me." after she beats my heart with a baseball bat from her rack of them , ranging in how hard they are, she comes to me and hugs me. then she tells me she loves me!!!! how can that be?? she even tells me things change and enfisises the point that she cant  control that. she wants to be rid of me but doesnt want to admit it... i wish she would have gotten rid of me before i reached my hand down into her. im not pure anymore and ive waisted it  on someone who thinks im nothing more than a toy here to please her and to beat on and hug. when we were together one night i played with her and she accidentaly got some of her period juices on my fingers. after that she didnt ask to repay the favor, she didnt even when i asked her to play with me just a little bit! she told me she didnt feel like it... ok, i can understand it if you dont wanna do anything sexual like that but later that week(btw this was the last week id be spending even in the same state for the next 2 or 3 weeks) i asked her to take a pic of herself and give it to me, to keep a memory alive. she told me no, i literaly begged her and she still said no the next day, which was the last time id see her(i think, it was today), she give me a pic of her, an old picture. i even said to her i wanted a new one so i could look at the one i love, not a memory of the past. but no! she gives me a picture months old... it hurt... it does hurt...  either i dont deserve her or she doesnt deserve me... if i dont deserve her then sometimes (which i find being alot lately) then i need alot more than i deserve...  i feel like i am giving and giving, but im not receving...   is there anyone out there who can help me? anyone who can help me undertand????  i cry...

       i dont get it... im a fool or something i cant seem to get dani off my mind, sure im mostly over her and i dont miss her menicing ways, but when im around her... her entising fregrant taunts me, her massive beauty mocks me, her perfict body lures me, her wonderful smile slays me... her damaging critacism stores up inside of me, her obviouse contempt for me spits on my feelings... dani, monica, matt, even ryan, they all are careless towards my emotions, everyone is... i can get no hug from someone who loves me, from no one who even cares... the feeling that im alone would be welcomed by me, if i could only be rid of the spite towards me, spite i do not deserve, spite that is directed towards me for reasons i may never understand... people wonder why i feel like im a bad person, its times like this, times that i cant find a single thought of reason for it... i actualy said "i should just kill myself" tonight and no one cared, i doubt anyone heard me though so im a basterd for mentioning it  i dont deserve it i guess, its not like im worth anything, it hurts me so much to say that but its most likely true... i dont help, i get things into more trouble  i need to be a hermit, to live alone, away from anything that can feel pain. That way it would be only me in pain... i wouldnt have to have anyone to complain to, no one to fail to care... i wish i didnt feel this way... i dont know what i want, what i need... God forgive me for my sins, if i know one thing, i need you

      well... theres not much to say now, she just emailed me and tole me its over, lol, over an email  she didnt have the curtasy to break up with me to my face but ol well, atleast its over and i can still say ive never broken up with anyone  i wish she could say she's sorry for treating me badly or for using atleast a month of my life(she prolly decided it was over more than a month ago) not even a thank you either, what great gratitude  actualy she put it like this "I regret to inform you that we're over. I'll give you the plain and simple answer: I'm not attracted to you anymore, not as my lover anyway. When I'm around you, all I see is a friend, not someone I'd have a romantic dinner with. I really don't know any better way to explain it. And I really don't have any way to elaborate." stuck up? just a little, just maybe  well thats life, any words of encouragement please tell me on aim, my names soshp  im ok with this i guess, i just wish she had said something or been more careing about it, but then again, why would she? its dani  yay for my private thoughts being posted without retaliation, lol

      i dont know whats wrong with me sometimes... i feel like there isnt any reason im here, i feel useless and like no one cares. I know its not true, whell the no one careing part atleast. i did something rather stupid today thats isnt big but made my brother stay home all day and i feel bad about that. Hes having his friend dan spend the night and dan hates my guts for whatever reason, just like pritty much everyone else...  i dont know why im such a loser, why im such a fool, why im such an idiot, why im such a freak, why im such a hypocrit... but i am what would be perfict for me is if someone here could tell me im not stupid, thats all. my girlfriend not only "exepts" that im stupid but she encourages it... she beleaves it more than i do and she expresses it... dont i have a wonderfull girlfriend? i dont have anyone i can depend on, i need someone who can be here for me, that i can hug and lean on, that can rub my shoulders and tell me im not stupid, things encouraging like a good friend should do, but of course, being the luckless loser i am, i dont have a single person who can do that for me...  im not told im perfect anymore and im not told im what people want... ive stopped helping people for my own selfishness, i shouldnt let my emotions and feelings and tensions get in the way of me helping people, its the one thing ive done in my life that makes my life worth something... what sux though is that i cant help anymore... i want to but i cant... ive lost my nack...  i want to go on about my needs, i need someone sweat, someone caring, loving, helping, naurishing, encouraging, listening, talking, sharing and so much more, im just too much of a needy selfish bastard... heh, my psychologist is wrong, he doesnt know everything... i wish i could explain myself, i cant even do that... if i could, hed agree, i am a selfish self centerd bastard...
