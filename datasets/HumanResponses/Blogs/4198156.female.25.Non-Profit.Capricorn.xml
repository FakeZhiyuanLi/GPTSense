       My sister and Daylin just found out the sex of the baby....and it is going to be a boy!  I'm so excited I can't sit still.  I had to tell someone right away so I called Divine all excited because she is the only one I know that can get personal phone calls at work - being that she works at home!  Okay...joy joy joy!!

       Ah, today is not starting out good for me at all!  To start things off "my friend" came today, and I was totally unprepared.  I hate that.  I didn't have anything in my purse or at my desk.  So yeah.  Problem is fixed, but you know how it is....shitters.  So I want to go home because now the cramps are starting to set in.  Damn me for going off the pill for two months.  I get cramps and they suck ass.  I am so use to not having any at all...so now I am a baby.  Okay...TMI...next.  Tomorrow my sister finds out the sex of her baby.  I want a girl. GIRL GIRL GIRL!  It would be so much fun.  But honestly...anything is just as wonderful.  As long as it is healthy and has ten fingers and toes.  =)  I don't know what my plans are for the rest of the day other than to clean my house...vacuum, do the floors, bathrooms and wash my sheets (George's shedding is going to kill me soon) and make some dinner.  I'm bored now...so I am going to go.  Till next time.

       Well at least I have made it through most of Monday.  It is almost 3!  Yeah!  I don't have any big plans or anything...just being away from the office gives me enough joy!  Things at work are progressively getting more and more hectic and main event just seems too close.    Anyways, I'm just bored at work, attempting to take a break...but the phone has rung twice since I have typed this little thing.  It is a sign I should get back to work.    Damn it.  Later.

       This weekend went by so fast.  I can't believe it is time to go back to work tomorrow.  =(  I'm not ready to go damn it!  I have spent most of my weekend with my Mom since my Dad is outta town visiting his mom in Fld.  I didn't really do much but visit, eat, (she cooked for me!!) and wash my car.    Till next time.  PS.  Divine I need some help with this blogspot stuff.  Can you help me?!?!

       , you read that right, I am working a Friday.  I think it has almost been three months since I have had to do this.  I was off on Monday because of New York and I didn't want to eat anymore vacation hours, so here I am.  I must say the commute was nice and easy.  I still got here on time and I didn't leave until 12 minutes before 7:30.  Things to accomplish today:  Mailing list for employee recognition luncheon (tent event #3), and mailing list for community recognition reception (tent event #4).  I have book most of the catering for tent week...all 13 events!  YIKES!!  Nah, really, I can't wait.  Plans for the weekend:  nothing major.  I am going to Corey's 30th birthday party on Saturday, but other than that, nada.  I will try and spend some time at the original home-front because my dad is out of town.  But other than that...nice, slow pace weekend.  Just like I like.  Till next time.  PS.  I'm not sure if I am really liking blogspot yet.  I miss my little emotion option and music option.  =/

       Oh life has me by the seat of my pants these days.  Since being back from New York things just seem busy.  I have only really been home one night relaxing and I am missing being in my house.  I think tonight I will try and clean and get some laundry started.  Good lord I need to…. the laundry is about to take over any day now.  Last night I took George and Gracie Lou to the dog park.  They ran and ran and ran until they couldn’t move anymore.  It was great.  He slept like he died last night.  What more could I ask for?!?!  My dad went to Florida this morning to visit my Grandma who is not feeling so well.  I don’t know what I really wrong, but I am sure I will get the whole scoop when he gets back into town.  There is a hurricane going on there though, it wasn’t exactly the best time for him to travel there.  But he is stubborn…. like father like daughter.  So today starts the official transition of my work place.  The Sisters of St. Joseph are slowly making their way back to Wichita for good .  Sr. Mary Alice is leaving today.  She wasn’t a founding “sister” like my boss, but she has been here for more years than I have been alive.  They are having a good-bye reception this afternoon.  It will be sad to see them leave and to see this organization lose it’s Catholic identity.  I always felt good about saying I worked for a Catholic institution. It made me feel like I was working in a place that really cared about what occurred.  We have heard it “will be the same”.  But only time will speak the truth.  Alright, I guess that is all for now.  Till next time.

       So I think I am finally back on California time.  I was so hating life yesterday.  I was up at 3:30 and couldn't fall asleep again.  Urgh.  But last night, I went to bed at 7:30 and slept all the way clear until  6:00 this morning.  It was great.  So, today, I am just getting back into the swing of things at work.  While I was in New York, we scored that $20,000 sponsorship that I was working on earlier in the month!  YEAH!!!  Very very good for St. Rose and not to mention ME!  (wink wink)  Alright....till next time.  Hey Divo!  Question - how do I post my picture and add my friends to my new blog?  HELP?!?!?  Later.
