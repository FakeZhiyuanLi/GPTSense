      argh im sooooo  BORED!!  jeez theres almost  nothing  to do in the summer...i still have to do almost all my honors english homework...so far i only read the part in the writing book...thats been really helpful with the worksheets...and i read one essay, did the worksheet, and one paragraph of the summary...still have to do 2 more paragraphs and the reaction-critique thingy...and read 3 more essays, do the analysis worksheets, summarys, and reactions on them...ARGH...next week im going to DC for a missions trip with my youth group...yay i can't wait...Jason will be there and Jake...ill will feel really safe...i did last year w/ Jason and now my brother will be there so ill be 2x as safe...yay...lol...Jake makes me feel really safe for some reason even tho we like never (!) talk...but oh well...i remember once on the bus i was sitting with Kim and two guys were sitting behind us and they were like kind of making fun of me and Jake was sitting behind them and the one guys like: "Ok...we better stop..." and the other ones like: "Why is that her brother back there?" and the first ones like: "Yeah...i know him..." so then they stopped...it was kind of stupid and very not important, but oh well...it just popped in my head, and i write whatever is in my head...which is not much but thats ok...     my little brother is so mean...whenever friends come over, he offers if they want to play XBox or computer or w/e and if they say yes or no, HE's the one who plays even tho he can play any day he wants...and just a few minutes ago, he sent one of his friends home so he could go to another friends house...isn't that rude? jeez...i would NOT want to be Victor's friend...i hate being his sister...    well thats about it for now...not much to talk about in the summer cuz its sooo boring
