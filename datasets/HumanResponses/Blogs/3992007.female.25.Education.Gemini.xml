      My mother thinks that my grandmother is an alcoholic.  She drinks four beers a night and I guess she is sneaky about it, throwing away old cans and putting new ones in their place when she thinks no one is looking and all that crazy stuff.  My grandparents have been living with my parents for this past week and it has seemed like there have been quite a few problems.  My grandpa is getting worse and worse with his alzheimers and my grandma, well, I already wrote about what her problem is.  I hear about all of it from my mother and I never know what to think.  I try to tell her that she has to start moving on getting my grandpa into a safe facility, but all she does is complain about the situation and never makes any moves toward fixing the problem.  This drives me crazy.  I know that they are her parents and that she doesn't want to have to do those types of things to them (separate them and all that), but she has to if she wants them to be safe.  Aside from hearing all about my grandparents I have been a lazy teacher.  I haven't worked much in my classroom or created much of a schedule or anything, but I have been reading.  That is what I love about the summer - time to read and enjoy relaxing in my apartment.  I guess I've had enough of that time since I returned from Europe, but I am going to start getting pretty possessive with the hours I have off.  Ah, Europe.  I think so often about how exciting it was to be there and how I met the most amazing people.  Of course, any memories of being lonely, exhausted, or frustrated have pretty much left my mind which I think is a good thing.  If I reread my travel journal I can see enough of the problems that I had although I don't think I recorded too much of it since I do tend to lean towards being an idealist.  I am curious if anyone has read any of the things that I write.  If you have, feel free to post a comment, even if it just says, "hey, I read your entry" or whatever.  I want to know if I'm sharing my thoughts with anyone besides myself.  Obviously, that is completely fine since I write quite a bit on my own at home as well and I think it is a theraputic thing to spew forth different thoughts and opinions and worries.  Funny how I will write about how I feel about issues to complete strangers, yet I don't share them with people I know.  I think that is fairly normal - maybe.  I never have been the kind of person who wants to lean towards normalcy; if this isn't normal I could care less.

      There is something glorious about the Blockbuster movie pass.&nbsp; Such freedom in being able to choose what I want to watch and take it home with me with no obligation to return it the next day - I love it.&nbsp; It works around my social life quite well since most of the time I enjoy watching movies alone.&nbsp; I don't quite know why I enjoy solitude during that particular act since most of the time I do like to be amongst or at least near other people.&nbsp; Even when I am reading or writing I would rather be in a coffee shop or at a park than at home.&nbsp; I think I am an extroverted introvert or something like that.&nbsp; Actually, since my trip I belive I have become more of an extrovert than I have ever been.&nbsp; I've really see-sawed between the desire for seclusion and the urge to socialize and now I think I'm all about the social life.&nbsp; I was able to be busy every evening last week and I loved it!&nbsp; I just wanted to be around people, having a good time and talking and probably getting attention.&nbsp; Maybe that is why I like it so much.&nbsp; It is a way to feed my inner attention-seeking demon.&nbsp; I think I like this more than I would usually care to admit, but I suppose it all makes sense when I think about how much I was on stage growing up.&nbsp; I loved hamming it up and having all eyes on me and now that it is the summer and I'm not teaching and I don't have much opportunity to perform I believe I grasp it in the form of my crazy social life.&nbsp; I sound messed up.&nbsp; Maybe I am.&nbsp; This is quite a theraputic thing to do - writing my ideas on the internet.&nbsp; I quite like realizing new things about myself while I write and it is a strange thing to note that others could read this if they wanted and they could think whatever they wanted to think about me.&nbsp; It is a bit like creating my own movie.&nbsp; My life in bits and pieces scattered on the internet. . .

      Yes, that title does lend itself to some racey ideas, but really it is just my first time using a web log.&nbsp; How exciting for me, I feel that I am climbing up the ladder of technology as I write this, although I pretty much know that I will still be writing in an actual journal at home.&nbsp; It is just such a fun thing for me to do.&nbsp; I decided to finally end that sentence.&nbsp; So, my summer is about half over and I'm feeling alright about that.&nbsp; I have been wanting to socialize much more than I have been able to, but that's alright.&nbsp; I have to savor those moments of complete relaxation on my couch while they last.&nbsp; I've also been watching many movies that are bad for the head of a single female.&nbsp; That's right, chick flicks are very unhealthy for a woman who has little to no intentions of dating within the near future.&nbsp; With teaching it is just all too difficult.&nbsp; I don't think it would be fair for me or the guy who would be involved.&nbsp; I know, I was warned by the crazy Mexican man who I met in Paris that I have to enjoy my body now before I get old and fat, but I don't have time for it and really, do I have to get fat when I get old?&nbsp; Is that something that happens to everyone?&nbsp; I don't think so - I see lots of skinny old ladies out there, although many of them look like their veins are ready to pop out of their skin and that isn't really attractive either.&nbsp; Maybe I will just be single forever.&nbsp; Is that really a terrible thing?&nbsp; Hmmm. . . I will have to think about that although lately all I've been thinking about is meeting my future husband just like Mandy Moore in Chasing Liberty.&nbsp; I know, it is such a pathetic thing to be watching movies like that, but I just can't help myself right now!&nbsp; I will have to go get Trainspotting for tonight or something equally nonromantic so that I can kill the hormones that are coursing through my body.&nbsp; I'm so dramatic.&nbsp; What a load of crap.

      Why is it that the people who I want to e-mail me never do and the people who I don't really want to hear from are constantly sending me forwards and mass e-mails about trivial events?  It is frustrating to log on and just be looking for one e-mail address to appear in my inbox and never to see it.  My life is like this with phone calls as well.  I suppose I do get phone calls from people I love and care about, but the few people who I really wish would call me just see to have me erased from their memories.  I'm therefore stuck trying to keep myself from calling that person.  I actually deleted a guy's number from my cell phone because I was scared that I would keep calling him and appear to be a sad, desperate female in need of attention when really I just wanted to talk to the guy.  And of course, he doesn't call.  Sigh.  I'm pretty much over it now, at least compared to how much I wanted to hear from this guy before, but sometimes, usually when I am driving home late I night, I still have to restrain myself from searching for his phone number and dialing it up.  Life is like that.  I am happy that my real life (school) will start up again soon so that once more I can become engrossed with all of the craziness that it entails and become unaware of what is going on in most of the rest of the world.  I know that I shouldn't want to shut myself off from the world, but when I teach that is what happens.  I find that by teaching children who pretty much live in a ghetto I lose some of my social skills and end up feeling awkward in situations involving groups of people.  I get almost downright giddy and have to contain my enthusiasm.  Maybe I just need some drugs.  We put our children on them and expect them to behave - perhaps I would behave too if I was on a mood-altering drug.

      I have two weddings to go to today.  This is quite a lovely situation for me since I will be able to spend time with people who I have not seen in quite a while.  I am actually kind of at one of the weddings at this moment.  I suppose it seems strange that I chose to write during such an event, but it is pretty much over and most of the people are gone and the reception was held in my school's gym.  Since this computer and my cell phone are my primary ways to access the internet I figured that I had enough time in-between now and when I should be at the next wedding to gather some thoughts and get them out.  The first wedding I went to was encouraging.  My friend who got married is about 4 years older than I am and it is just refreshing to see that people can get married when they get older.  I know that they can and that often they do, but it is hard to remember that when you are 25 and all of your friends are running around with their husbands.  I know that because of my background more people get married at an earlier time (more around 22 and 23) and because of that I have often felt like the weirdo.  I blend in better with the rest of the world because of that, but morally I have a difficult time with much of the world.  Not to be self-righteous or say that I don't spend time with people who don't go to church, but sometimes I can start to feel uncomfortable in different situations.  I have been sheltered for such a long time that now when I go out and get hit on I don't think that the guy wants to get me to sleep with him, I just think I'm having a fun time and that it is all harmless.  Whatever.  Strange topic to write about really.  Today during the dinner for the wedding I got to be in charge of the wine.  I got to walk around and make sure all of the tables had enough wine and were able to drink with ease.  I enjoyed the job and was told that I should be a wine steward.  I just might have to do that sometime.  I wonder if it pays better than teaching.  I would think it does - most things do.  Not that I'm in teaching for the money.  Alrighty, enough random writing.  I should go and see if anyone is still around and then head to the next event.  I'm ready to dance the night away with my crazy friends.
