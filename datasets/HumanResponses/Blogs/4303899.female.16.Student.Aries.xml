       Hey funny folks out there, this the CongressSweetie writing in with her first blog. Having realized that I am the only person in the entire world who has yet to start a blog, I have decided to go with the flow and lose all semblance of individuality by following the latest trend. Here you will find random rants, discussion topics on current events, advances on my story, and various other things that interest me temporarily. I welcome e-mails at   urlLink  Reader9665@aol.com   , so don't hesitate to write in and let me know what you think. I'm going to start things off with a few reviews.        Books:       An American Childhood  by Annie Dillard      Okay, this book was summer reading, admittedly, and I wouldn't have read it if not required by the AP English 11 teachers. Nevertheless, I found it to be an undoubtedly interesting book. There's something in there for everyone--the reminiscer will love her nostalgia, the child development enthusiast will be captivated by her accurate description of what it's like to think as a kid, and the poet will love her use of visual imagery. Apart from being a novel about one girl's personal experiences growing up in a nuclear family in the '50s in Philadelphia, it also contains generic truths about childhood and adolescence, plus an interesting historical context. The book unfortunately suffers from several sporadic dull spots (at least to those of us who aren't bug-collecting enthusiasts), but thankfully these are few. The book takes a slow, enjoyably leisurely pace, which sometimes gets to be a bit too slow. Still a fairly decent book (especially compared to some of the other summer reading books).    6/10       Movie:      A Few Good Men (1992),  directed by Rob Reiner.      Starring Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, and Demi Moore    Needless to say, I missed the boat a bit on this one, seeing as this movie was made twelve years ago. Of course, if I had seen it back when it came out, I think I would have missed out on several of the jokes, not to mention the entire plot. (I was a fairly bright four-year-old, but no one's that smart). Still, they say better late than never, and this is particularly true with regards to this classic. This movie touches on several extremely thought-provoking themes, including honor, loyalty, and the time-old debate over whether people are responsible for what happens when they follow orders. It's also got the greatest courtroom blow out ever ("What do you want?" "I want the truth!" "You can't handle the truth!") and is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Jack Nicholson plays a truly chilling Colonel Jessup, and Tom Cruise is excellent as protagonist Kaffee. Demi also pulls a worthy performance. If you were also busy fingerpainting when this movie first came out, make up for lost time and see it pronto.    9/10       TV:      Charmed,  starring Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Holly Marie Combs    Okay, so I admit, this show is not exactly  Law &amp; Order , or the  Simpsons , or maybe even  Friends . But after having spent a ridiculous amount of hours this summer getting hooked to this drama on TNT reruns, I'm compelled to admit that this TV show actually does have merit (apart from the unarguably attractive guys). The show's content-based virtues are two-fold: one, it promotes a healthy family dynamic and family unity. For all over their very major flaws, the three sisters do love each other and work together. Secondly, it of course promotes good over evil, and gives hope to us poor schmoes out there that short women can actually beat the bad guys. This show is frighteningly addictive, and despite my rationalizing their so-called virtues above, I must admit that the primary purpose of this show is to admire the guys--Leo, Chris, and of course, the adorable baby Wyatt. If you don't take it too seriously and can just accept that it's pure escapism, it's an extremely enjoyable show. On that standard, it earns a 7/10 (points taken off for having vanquished the excessively yummy Cole).     More later.     Love,   CongressSweetie     Mood: Excited      Music: Motown
