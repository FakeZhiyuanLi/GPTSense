      I got this thing to work =P. Now you all have the pleasure of reading my uninteresting ramblings. My momentary lack of cohesion is preventing me from posting anything entertaining... or maybe it's my dull lifestyle. Probably the latter =\.   Nothing much on my agenda for the next few weeks other than finding a job and studying for the PSATs so feel free to bother me. It'll give something to do. =)

      This will probably be my last post from The Garden State - or better known as New Jersey.  Its been our home for the past year and a half or so.  Oddly enough, as much as I hated it here when we first arrived, this place has grown on me.  We've really enjoyed the community we live in and the wonderful people we've met here.    We're about 90% moved out now.  We had to ask for an extra day to clear out and the Leasing Office Manager has agreed to allow us to turn in the keys on Thursday before end of business at no extra cost.  Whew!  It's amazing how much crap we've accumulated in the past four years of our life - considering we left Toronto with really just our clothes, a handful of Jessica's favorite toys, and a few kitchen necessities.    The goodbyes have been pretty sentimental.  Our friends from church presented us with some really nice gifts for us to remember them by.  You should have seen me - I was one crying mess. I don't do well in the goodbye department.    Earlier this evening, Jay played one last game of ball with his boys.  Our complex has a pretty sweet clubhouse with an indoor basketball court.  After the game, the guys presented Jay with the ball they've been playing with.  I thought that was really sweet.  Jay has invited them to play in Toronto one weekend when we're more settled.   So life on the American side of the border is over and we re-start a new one in our home and native land.  But damn, if the Referendum goes through and the Bloc Quebecois come into power - we're screwed.  And we're packing up our bags and heading south of the US-Canadian border faster than you can say "au revoir".

      What I thought was supposed to be a routine cavity filling ...turned out to be most people's "Dentist Visit Nightmare".  I went to the Dentist on Saturday with the inclination that I would only have to endure a filling, but it turned out after all the drilling and sawing (okay a little over exaggerated) that the Dentist would have to proceed with a route canal.  Eeeek! So half an hour later I was looking into a half attacked tooth. And an hour or so later I had my tooth filled with a 5 or 6 temporary tiny cotton balls and some sort of cap (or caveat as my dentist called it) to temporary hold the gap in my tooth until my next hour and a half visit to permanently refill my tooth. By the way is not for another 2 weeks..and the  temporary  cap seems to be breaking apart... that's just great!     Although, as most people would have thought this nightmare to be a painful procedure...It wasn't as bad as I thought.  I was able to enjoy the BBQ Party Darryl and Jamie hosted for their friends, although the help of some not so PG-13 beverages and even ice cream cake (hee!) also helped me through this ordeal.  So kiddies what's the moral of my story... Remember to keep brushing those teeth...and eating those sweets...hahaha!!!

      I've just realized that with all this talk about moving I haven't really mentioned where we're moving to.  Sorry, you're all probably completely confused at this point.    For those of you who aren't aware, Jay's contract at his last consulting gig in New Jersey was not renewed this time around. He found out the same week we got back after Lolo's funeral.    Long story short, he accepted a permanent position with an Atlanta based company that is looking to expand into Canadian markets. He will be part of the team in charge of that and the company has given him the opportunity to telecommute from Toronto after his training is over. This is his dream - working from a home office in pj's in Toronto and still having the advantage of making US dollars.  That was just too sweet of a deal to pass up. So we're giving up the consultant's nomad lifestyle...at least for now.    That being said we'll be back in Toronto on a more permanent basis soon.  But I still haven't given up my dream to live in California again one day. I see Cin frowning over there because she's been on a mission to get us back there ever since we left.    And so now if you're confused as all heck, you are not alone!  I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the logistics of this move too.  Hee!  Oh and welcome to the blog finally Lovielyn!  Glad to see you here.

      I'M ALIVE!!!  Thanks Judy for re-sending the invite. Long story short...I have solved the mystery of the difficult blog!!!  Now if we can only get my younger bros to join us! Yes, we know procrastination runs on our side of the family :) Right Ronald?  As I recall during our famous late night "Table" discussion, we reminisced about the wonderful world of Hand-Me-Downs! I felt the need to share some of my findings with my dearest and eldest (or even youngest) Hand-Me-Down providers. Hee Hee! Enjoy!   Miss you all!

      I've sort of resigned from the politics of the CTCMA and TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) establishment here.  I've been told time and time again to just focus on the books, and not to get caught up in the chaos of my chosen field.  While I've tried my best, I do feel like that it got the best of me.  Studying is difficult, and my motivation, shot.  Meanwhile, my personal relationships are suffering, and I'm just confused as heck.  I hope that things will work out for me.  On the other hand, to cheer myself up, I bought three pairs of shoes.  And now it's crunch time...

      Norm and I met up with our friends last night.  We had dinner at Nara Nara, a fabulous Mediterranean restaurant.  This place is known as one of the few hot spots in Orange County that serves authentic ethnic cuisine and hooka pipes.  As Desiree can attest to (wink wink), hooka pipes are glorified Moroccan bongs.  Asides from getting my ears pierced in college, this is probably the third most "frowned upon" act I have ever done.  It was not the 0.005% mango flavoured tobacco high that I found most enjoyable, but the communal act of sharing a bong amongst friends.  I sat back and felt a sense of camaraderie, trust and openness.  Madness?  Absolutely not.  More like Hooka Camaraderie...just for that evening only.

      ...and I do use the term 'joy' rather loosely in this case.  I'm taking a little break from this hell that is otherwise known as moving.  For all the times I've practiced, I thought I'd be pretty good at it by now.  Perhaps my skills are a little rusty since we have remained at the same address for a year and a half now (that's a record).    Yesterday, our friends here in the Crystal Ridge Club community took us to a Farewell Lunch at one of the most popular Chinese restaurants in our county.  It was a really nice time eating, chatting and laughing.  After lunch, the ladies and the children relaxed by the pool for a couple hours and continued the conversation out there.  We've met some really wonderful people here where we live.  Our common denominator was that we had all moved here from out-of-state (California) and out-of-country (Japan) even.    Our friends and old neighbors from the SF Bay Area are in town visiting their families.  Jane and Paul and their kids are like family to us.  Their daughter Brianna is Jessica's best little buddy on the west coast.  We were neighbors in Dublin, California at one time.  They came over last night for late coffee and dessert.  It's always great to see them.  Oddly enough, they always seem to be around whenever we're moving.  They were our lifesavers and helped us move more times than I can count. I just hope that one day, Jay and I can return the favor.  Jane and I always joke that one day we'll be neighbors again and when we can't find our daughters at 2am, most likely they'll be together.  Good times with good friends!    Today is Brianna's 6th birthday and they are celebrating with an impromptu birthday party at her grandparents home.  Jessica is looking forward to attending Brie's party.  It'll also give us a chance to say goodbye to Jane and Paul's family who also became good friends to us during our tenure here.    Well...I really should get back to packing now.  Ugh...someone just kill me!  Hope you are all having a wonderful day in your corner of the continent.

      I was priveleged to attend my piano student's high school graduation last night to which I was so proud of her valedictory address.  It wasn't really because of the fact that she was academically inclined, but mostly because her speech was so advanced for the few and seemingly inexperienced years of her young life... She spoke about the "human condition" as a module of polar opposites, where there exists great despair and corruptibility alongside the triumphs of collective intellectual or philosophical pursuits - and that both circumstances were indispensable truths of the human frame. She spoke to a sold out auditorium with so much passion, it was impossible not to reflect and reconsider how each one of us matters and makes a difference! Wow!...she somehow reminded me of Ronald...  So cheers to all of you who positively affect others, as I know I was by all of you that night at the "Table", Rebekah

      Hey, the blog finally went through for me. I just got home after a day of walking around various area's of Vancouver. My Graduation was 2 days ago and I'm still kinda weirded out by the fact I won't be going back to high school, but all my other cousin's and sibling's (other than Jun) graduated so long ago that it's probably a faded memory for them. Jeez I'm so young. I'm very tired. I have finals too, which will eat the crap out of my first 3 weeks of summer. Plus I need a job (badly). I can't be a scrub leeching of the hunnies any more. Anyway, I'm most likely boring you, so I'll stop.  Wait, w00t Detroit Pistons! Haha. Detroit what? I know everyone else is hating me now.  Oh, here's a picture of me for you:        If you want a full-sized version I can send it to you (I don't see why you would want it though...)

      No, we won't be celebrating this time.  Those damn Lakers!  Norm is still in shock from last night's tragic loss.  We were so excited to attend game six, which would have been tomorrow.  So much for Norm's purple and gold face paint.  Perhaps next year...      Happy Happy Birthday Wishes to Judy!  You only turn 30 once.     We can't wait for you guys to visit.  We'll have fun celebrating your birthday...Norm has big plans.  Have a wonderful and relaxing day!  Burke Williams here we come.

      Today would have been Jesse's 35th birthday.  Knowing him, he would have had a nice celebration that involved some kind of yummy dinner, a decadent dessert and a great cup of coffee.  Miss you lots!  I'm in the process of sending condolence cards to some of our hardcore Lakers fan relatives right now!  :(

      So I'm feeling a little under the weather today - and  coincidently the weather here in Jersey is sunny and 82 degrees and perfect to be out by the pool.  I started running a fever last night and probably made the situation worse by sitting at the pool with Jessica and some of her little friends for most of the afternoon.    As you can tell, I'm real excited about this Dario blog.  I love writing and must admit that I am fairly addicted to my personal blog and now probably this blog too. So far only Rebekah and Cindy have accepted the invitation to join. What's the hold up other cousins?  Hee!  In other news, Auntie Charee and Desiree are back from their trip to the Philippines.  I was on the phone with them a little earlier today talking about all the escapades in our motherland.  Hopefully, Desiree will jump online and share her stories in this blog.    Alright kids, gotta go and get more rest.  Its bad timing to be sick right now because my To-Do list is super long.  Love you all!  Start posting cousins!

      The idea to start the Dario Cousin Blog came about shortly after the death of our Lolo Luis Dario.  It had been a very long time since all of us were under the same roof, let alone the same time zone.  Somewhere around that kitchen table, we found a natural curiosity for each other and realized that we had lost so much with the passing of time and that we hardly knew one another.    It is here where we can share our feelings and thoughts with one another. You'd be amazed to see how much you can learn about a person when you open up their journal.  Hope you will enjoy this as much as I do!  Much love!  On a more personal note, my family and I are soon about to make some changes in our lives.  We're moving...again!  Wish you all could be closer to help us slug boxes.  And I'm not kidding about that!  I'd put you all to work.  Hee!  I'm sad that we have to leave our friends and NY family, but eagerly anticipating the new adventures that lie ahead.  Please keep us in your prayers.

       Sorry for not posting much. I've been away from the computer alot in the past few weeks. Nothing really important has happened to me, so I couldn't really find anything important to say. While it has been hot the past few days (see: "This Heat is Making Me... below for confirmation). I've been sleeping in the living room, where it's nice and cool.   Really, nothing very interesting has happened to me. I've been to the various Vancouver summer events (i.e. Chinatown and Richmond’s Nightmarket, the P.N.E.) which where repeats of previous years (boring).   I'm really mad at myself for not doing much with my comic in the last two weeks, but I rarely find the time to get it done. I've been working on two mini projects and I've pushed Him, Her, Them into a hiatus. I'm trying hard to get sketches in when I have free time, but I don't get much time to scan, color and word the pages.   Anyways, I'm off to watch some anime with a friend (I'm a dork). I'll be trying to post more often.     currently listening to:  kool and the gang - summer madness

      Finally after three long weeks of being apart, we're flying to Atlanta as a family at 1pm today. It'll be nice to be together again and I can't wait to explore the city - just the three of us. And I'm excited that I'll be able to use my cell and take advantage of my mobile to mobile and free long distance again. Yay!   Happy 22nd Birthday Desiree! I hear you'll be enjoying the Jersey shores this year. Have a beautiful day...and blog about it. Hee!   Edit:&nbsp; Greetings from HOTlanta - whew!&nbsp; It was 88 degrees when we arrived after sunset.&nbsp; More on our new surroundings once we get a chance to get out for some exploration.&nbsp; This part of town reminds alot of Hazleton Lanes along Avenue Rd. area in Toronto.&nbsp;

      It was scorching hot in my piano room today.  I felt sorry for my students who had to sit for an hour in the tiny crammed space for their lesson.  At one point the heat was so intense that even I wasn't listening to what I was saying.  I cooled them down with frozen juice and Pocky Sticks.  (One of the tactics I use is to dose the kids with sugar to give them that extra 'perk'. Fun for me = fun for everyone!)  At the end of the day, I'd completely forgotten that I only had a bowl of cereal and a Krispy Kreme donut all day. It was one of those days where I'd scheduled students back to back and had not scheduled time to eat.    (Um, okay. So it was me coming down from the sugar.  The kids were fine.)  I spent the rest of the evening - not eating - but washing my car at my dad's house.  I suppose that my eulogy to Lolo sort of reinstated myself as 'also another  favorite'.  Dad's first favorite, CJ, the cat.  No joke.  So it's about 10pm, and I'm almost emaciated. I'll go upstairs and fix myself a nice...what,.... no rice??!! aargghhh!!

      Its funny how weddings bring out the best in people...and sometimes the worst.  I've been married for 7 years and I still remember how stressful planning my wedding was.  Let's face it - a wedding can single handedly divide any relationship in two seconds flat.  It still bewilders me how what should probably be the most beautiful, romantic event in a person's life can bring out the fangs and claws.  Underneath the Cinderella gown, crystal tiara and photo perfect makeup application is a terrorist attack waiting to happen.  Seriously!    Ah well, but after all the confetti and icing sugar settles, we'll all be back to being just regular people who love each other...or at the very least stand to be in the same room with each other and all those disagreements and misunderstandings will be forgotten.  Cheers to marital bliss and tons of champagne to go with that.

      This morning at work, I was preparing for a patient that has been coming in for whirlpool and wound care.&nbsp; As I opened the door to our hydroroom, I was&nbsp;greeted by the most foul and horrific&nbsp;odour&nbsp;ever...&nbsp;and about 20 flies!&nbsp; Disgusting!&nbsp; I would have&nbsp;killed all 20 flies myself, if it weren't for the horrid&nbsp;smell.&nbsp; So I call environmental services to take care of the situation, just to find out that these small brownish black flies are&nbsp;an endangered species.&nbsp; They are the infamous delhi sand flies of Colton, California.&nbsp; And there is a $10, 000 fine if one is caught killing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ludicrous!&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time, several bewildered&nbsp;patients are waiting to be treated in the hydroroom.&nbsp; Administration decides to shut down the hydroroom until a county environmentalist is available to assess the situation.&nbsp;   I find this absurdly humorous.&nbsp; I could understand if it were a spotted owl, but come on now.&nbsp; One word... RAID !&nbsp; Whatever happened to hospital&nbsp;hygiene?&nbsp; Afterall, I do work in an hospital and one of our main goals is infection control.&nbsp;   So the next time you spot a brownish black fly with a banded yellow abdomen and green bulgy eyes, I would think twice about swatting them.

      Four months ago, I was quite excited about our backyard design.&nbsp; Our neighbour, who is a brilliant landscape architect and alumnus from Norm's alma mater, insistently&nbsp;offered her services to us.&nbsp; She drew up a beautiful&nbsp;plan, recommended her contractors and told us that she would be willing to&nbsp;supervise the whole project... All this, free of charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was already imagining&nbsp;a breath-taking&nbsp;Spanish courtyard with airy palms, sprawling bouganviella&nbsp;and a cool, relaxing fountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, she bailed out one month into the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the landscape challenge begins.  &nbsp;  This past weekend, I was on a mission to get the best deals on planting materials.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costco had Queen Palms as their featured seasonal item. &nbsp;&nbsp;Norm managed to load up&nbsp;our&nbsp;SUV with four 15 foot tall palms, in the wind and heat.&nbsp; Actually, never mind the wind and heat - our poor SUV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dirt and soil scattered everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;There we were, two Filipinos and four palm trees in a SUV, slowly driving down the streets at 20 mph with our blinkers on, and me trying to hold the pots from rolling around the trunk.&nbsp; Can we be anymore ghetto?&nbsp; The following day, we borrowed Dad's pick up truck.  &nbsp;  This evening I strategically designed our plant layout in preparation for tomorrow.&nbsp; We will&nbsp;be laying sod, preparing the planter areas and planting trees and flowers.&nbsp; We could use Uncle Roger's help right about now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Inspite of all the minor set backs and working without our initial designer, I think we pulled through and came up with our own backyard vision.&nbsp; I can't wait&nbsp;for the final results!

      I should be in Atlanta right now, but I'm not.  Its a long story, but Jay arrived in Toronto late Friday night.  He was dead tired and the thought of driving 17 hours to Atlanta as orginally planned was not one he particularly relished.  After some discussion, he jumped online and booked 3 airline tickets for us to leave yesterday afternoon.    Well...Jay was the only one who left.  I went to bed early Sunday morning with chills then woke up halfway through the night in a sweat.  Just great! What a bad time to have a fever!  When I got up Sunday morning, getting on a plane was the last thing I felt like doing.  Thankfully enough, we were able to get a refund on the tickets for Jessica and I.  So I'm in Toronto another week. We leave next Sunday, since Jay has to fly in to attend his brother's Bachelor Party.   Jay and I are both a little frustrated.  He's beginning to hate the travel and we all hate being apart all week *sigh*.  In the meantime, I'm downing orange juice like its going out of style and getting plenty of rest.

      Feels so good to have as little responsibility again.&nbsp; The board exams went alright; I can't commit myself to saying I did well or poorly, but I can say that I tried my very best.&nbsp;I don't find out how I did until late Sept/Oct. &nbsp; So today, I'll work for an hour and a half, then read a book by the beach if it's not too hot.&nbsp; We've been getting great weather lately, and it sure makes my little celebration that much sweeter.&nbsp; I hope to just relax for the next two weeks, recoup, get lots of sleep, eat right, and hit the gym... (I mean it this time!)    &nbsp; As for the rest of you, what are you up to? I think we should extend the blog to the other halves - Jay, JP, Jamie, Norm. It would be nice to keep in touch with them too. &nbsp; Until my next post...have a beautiful week!

      So Jessica and I have been in Toronto for a little more than a week now and I'm beginning to feel neither here nor there.  I've got one foot in the US and the other here on Canadian soil.  Our furniture and personal belongings (and my heart) are in Jersey, my daughter, my clothing (and my body) are in Toronto, and my husband is in Atlanta.  Aaargh!    I'm in blog withdrawal and can't update my personal website since my files and my computer are in a box.  Jay is this close to finally making the leap and purchasing that laptop so we can be totally mobile.  Jay and I are pretty useless without our computer and high-speed internet.     In other news, Jay's first week with the new company went well, but busy as all hell (whoa what a poet I am!) He arrived into Toronto early Saturday morning and flew back to Atlanta first thing this morning.  I think business travel lost all its glamour in about 5 minutes flat.    Jessica started swimming lessons today.  She's in AquaQuest 2 at 9am.  Good way to get me going in the morning - that and an extra large double double Tim's!  Yum!

      Jay started his new job in Atlanta, Georgia yesterday.  So far things are looking very promising.  He says his new colleagues are friendly (it's the southern way).  He's got a few challenges on his plate and the learning curve is steep - but that's alright with him.    So second day on the job, Jay is finding himself on an airplane again to meet clients in San Jose, CA with a few colleagues from the Atlanta office.    Imagine the fear when I checked my email yesterday afternoon to see a flight confirmation from America West showing that charges had been made to our credit card for a flight from San Jose to Toronto with a layover in Las Vegas.  What the!!!  Thoughts of identity theft ran through my mind as I quickly dialed Jay's cell.  Turns out it was him making the booking for his return flight from his first business trip with his new company.  Ummmm hello - he could've booked me a ticket too for crying out loud!  Hee!  But since he is charging all kinds of business expenses on his personal credit card (and racking up the air miles in the meantime), I do see a free trip out west to visit Cin and Norm pour moi in the near future. Yay!

      I've been living at Starbucks lately, and if you can't find me there, I'm stuck in my favorite little Italian Cafe in Kerrisdale not too far from home.  The house next door was demolished this morning, which means that I have been up at the crack of dawn for the past few days and will continue to be for the next two months. So much for studying at home and getting a decent night's rest.   I've somewhat resigned to a state of complacency, a sort of withdrawal or resolute dissatisfaction since knowing that the boards are drawing near.  This is unlike any other exam I have prepared for; fairness and equality among applicants seems like a misguided storybook ordeal.  In addition to the inexperienced employees at my school, the governing association of BC and the ambiguous evaluation standards which differ from doctor to doctor, I feel at a complete loss.  This sense of hopelessness is not uncommon among my classmates and other applicants.   If I've confused anybody, here's how it works: there are two parts to my exam - a written and a practical.  The written exam is made up of 30 or so case studies to which we must answer within 4 hours. A large percentage of that is made up of "survey questions", which means that the licensing board is still "tweaking" their testing style. The practical portion consists of point location on human models, and the presiding doctor will determine if the points are correct. This is also a problem, because everyone knows that this varies from acupuncturist to acupuncturist, based on their education and personal experience. Now, even if you attain a high mark, they can only grant a certain number of licenses per year.  So, no matter how much I study or practice (and I have been only studying and practicing for the last long while), I don't know what it comes down to.  There is an unusually large volume of applicants this time around since the exams are offered only once a year now. I don't believe in "getting to know" the examiners or those on the granting committee, and I don't believe in "dressing to impress".   I should have applied for the US certification exam initially. It's a little easier since anatomical charts are provided for point location instead of human models.  Well, I will take my chances and keep my head up. Here goes nothing!

      I'd forgotten how great the city of Toronto is.  Sure we've lived near two of the largest most cosmopolitan American cities - San Francisco and New York City.  But Toronto is still  home home  I suppose.  Alot has changed - where the heck did that Bank of America building come from?  And there are new luxury condos every time you turn around.  There are a few more homeless people sleeping in front of City Hall than I remember.    Some friends from New Jersey made the drive back and spent the weekend here with us.  Of course we took them to Niagara Falls.  We did the Maid of the Mist tour - my first time ever believe it or not!  I caught some great digital which I'll post soon.    This city is beautiful and CLEAN!  But its going to take me some time to get used to the 15% sales tax.  Ouch!  I'll definitely need a job to afford myself here.  Hee!

      I finally finished up the character concept sketches and one-third of the script for my comic. I have also updated the comic (which at this moment isn't working because .tk is a piece of crap). I really want to buy a domain, but I lack the credit card (and my dad will not let me use his, it took me a year and a half to convince him to let me get a paypal account). Ah... if only www.himherthem.com was mine, instead of having to use a spyware infested redirecting service like dot-tk.  Since most of you read my comic (at least I hope you still do...) I wanted to let you know that it has the first page up. It isn't as clean looking as the old one, but I like it this way. It's a little more messy and the coloring is different (more simple). I'm illustrating something a little more personal this time. The old story was much more corny and I had no idea what I was going to do after the first chapter. You can check out the change at www.himherthem.tk. If it's not working and says 'DOMAIN NAME IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. PLEASE TRY AGAIN IN 5 MINUTES.' it's because dot-tk is a bastard. It has done this a dozen times this week.  As of right now I am doing only two things. Looking for a job and my comic. It's pretty lame and boring for me right now (although most of my friends spend the day eating cereal and lying down in their basements watching nicktoons). I'm also doing some mini-comics (Kinko’s style) that I will sell around Vancouver. I met a woman who said she would put my comics for sale at her comic shop, which will be pretty awesome.  Hope your all having an interesting summer!

      After living and working in the States for 7 years now, should I be ashamed that I have yet to learn the words to their national anthem? I am still very proud to be Canadian.  And I find there are several things I miss about Canada.    I envy your conveniently coloured money.  Or as some of my old college friends would say, "monopoly money."  The colours are prettier and easier to decipher.  You can tell a true Canadian by the way he/she speaks.  I miss the way Canadians pronunciate and annunciate their words.  So much better on the ears.  I am fed up with the southern drawls and Yankee slurred talk.    And finally, most everyone in Canada speaks English!  Here, I'm struggling to get through a patient's initial evaluation with broken Spanish.  And my patients have the audacitiy to ask me why I don't speak Spanish!  We are living in North America!  To all my Canadian cousins, Happy Canada Day!

      After two months of waiting for the "hard-to-come-by" colour and model, it's finally sitting in my garage.  This afternoon, Norm and I bought our first "family" vehicle together.  It was the best car purchasing experience ever!  No pushy salesman, no haggling, no B.S. period.  We checked in, signed the docs, inspected the vehicle, got the basic orientation and drove off the lot - all this in under 40 minutes.  Unbelievable.  What the Filipino Mafia can do for you!  Just kidding.  Although we did have Filipino connections working on this deal.    I'm currently on vacation until next week.  I told Norm to drive the new car to work tomorrow, since his coworkers wanted to see it.  His reply "Heck no! I'm not driving that mother-of-pearl coloured car."  So I guess that makes me the primary driver.  :)

       urlLink    Summer in Atlanta 2004  urlLink     Last week as Jessica and I were walking along our usual Peachtree St. route, a salt-and-pepper haired gentleman standing in front of the Woodruff Arts Center office commented "I work for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and I see you and your daughter walk by our office everyday.  I can hear your conversations and she sounds like a very smart girl!"  On a sidenote, we play "I-Spy" during our walks.   I've been a stay-at-home mother for 5 years and this job is usually thankless.  Not that I expect the thanks and recognition, but it just feels nice to know that I've been doing something right along the way.

       urlLink    Solitude  urlLink     Today we stood atop Stone Mountain and enjoyed breathtaking panaromic views of Georgia from 863 feet above ground level. I've recently discovered that I love taking photographs and since then I carry my digital camera practically everywhere I go. As I was taking shots of the views, I noticed a man perched on a rock formation, reading his Bible in solitude. I couldn't help but think that he had chosen just the perfect spot to be alone with his God, his thoughts and nature.  It seems that life rushes by at break-neck speed. A moment of solitude, or at least the mere thought of it, seems like pure luxury. I have to slow down to remember to take more minutes alone to regroup and to appreciate the gift of silence.  I'm currently working on a 26 Things Photography Project. I'll post the link when its completed so you can see samples of my attempts at creative effort. In the meantime, enjoy some quiet time!

       urlLink    Pinoy's Represent!  urlLink     Coca-Cola Corporate Headquarters is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Today we visited  The World of Coca-Cola , a museum that houses an unparalleled collection of over 1000 memorabilia tracing the rich heritage and global reach of the world's most popular soft drink. We were really quite amused to find that Pinoy's represent at Coke - a Coca-Cola Philippine jeepney was on exhibit in the International Gallery. Knowing that it would make for excellent blog material, I made my poor husband take on  the squat pose  in front of the jeepney to up the truly pinoy factor (much to his dismay).  Another interesting aspect of the tour was the opportunity for guests to sample various Coca-Cola products sold in foreign markets and not available in North America. My favorites were the apple flavored soda sold in China and the lychee flavor one sold in Thailand. I certainly won't be rushing out to stock up on the bitter tasting soda sold in Italy. And in case you're wondering there wasn't an adobo flavored soda from the Philippines. But you'll be happy to know that Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. is one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers in the world and employs more than 19,000 Filipinos.  Mabuhay Coca-Cola - truly fobilicious!

      Hello? Summer? Where are u?  Unfortunately, for us Torontonian cousins we have not had the liberty of experiencing Summer weather like the rest of our cousins. Our Summer so far has consisted of Spring like temperatures with a touch of May showers. At the start of this work week, the weather was forecasted as rain, rain, some sunshine and more rain. The day it was supposed to be nice and sunny, turned out to be dark and rainy. And to top it all off that was the day I decided I didn't need an umbrella....grrr...How is a girl to pick out the perfect outfit each day? HA! I am not one for baking in the hot sun nor feeling sweat and perspiration against my skin . However, I would feel some sort of comfort knowing I experienced a Summer which normally includes a weather forecast with days upon days of sun! Ahh...who am I kidding!

      Yes it's true! My guitar order finally came through! I don't know if I mentioned it to anyone while in TO, so quick recap:   I have been taking guitar lessons off and on since last Christmas, and with the help of my teacher, I ordered a specially made guitar by a renowned guitar maker here in Vancouver. It's a different sort of guitar, particularly useful for playing flamenco and classical styles.  The specs I ordered were cedar and french polish for the top plate, Indian rosewood and lacquer finish on the side and back plates, ivory fret board, titanium machine heads (aka "nuts"), normal tension strings, 12-hole bridge, and a beautiful abalone/ivory rosette (the design around the soundhole), carefully handcrafted and shaped like a twisted rope.  It doesn't look impressive when you see it, but wow! Sound projection is excellent and tone quality is dark and brooding, which are perfect for the songs I want to learn.  What have I done with it? Umm...nothing yet. I've sat with it. It's sort of a source of frustration because it put me in the hole. A big one.  And it came at such an inopportune time when I just finished school and want to go out and enjoy my summer.  I feel the pressure since now I have to find a job and I find myself back in the "catch 22" phase.  So it's understandable that I play it...one note at a time.

      This morning I woke up extremely fatigued, dizzy, nauseated and my leg, feet and back muscles ached. Two things went through my head...Which couldn't possiblely be. It wasn't. I gather from my ailments, that I'm most likely suffering from heat exhaustion. The temperatures here have been wretchedly hot! Midafternoon yesterday, it reached a scorching 101 degrees. But as these west coast people are fond of saying "It's a  dry  heat." Anyhow, I spent most of the day outdoors (duh!), visiting nurseries and working in the garden. While pruning some shrubs, I ran into several black widows. I hate spiders, especially ugly ones. I think I got a little too happy with the insecticide. Hmmm, so it may be a combination of the heat and insecticide fumes that's making me sick. So, I will definitely call off work today. And I'll be sure to stay indoors.

       urlLink    Greasy Goodness!  urlLink      The Varsity  is the world's largest drive-in and has been an Atlanta tradition since 1928. Its quite a landmark in this city and an eating experience that you have to do at least once (probably because you won't be able to handle another round after that) when you're in town.  For you trivia buffs, they serve 200 miles of hot dogs, a ton of onions, 2500 pounds of potatoes, 2000 pounds of fresh and never frozen onion rings, 5000 fried pies and 300 gallons of chili made from scratch on a daily basis.   We had the chili dogs with a side of onion rings, a burger with fries, chocolate milkshake, the orange frosty and Coke (you can't say Pepsi in this city). It was sinfully delicious, but still no comparison to  In-N-Out . I had hoped to try their famous fried peach pie, but the thought of another greasy bite was too much for one day.  Yup, you bet I worked out tonight and probably should up that cardio time for the rest of the month. Ugh!

      It’s been a while since my last blog so I have a lot of catching up to do…  So where do I start? Well the last blog I babbled about my dentist appointment. Can you believe I have been to the dentist 5x in the last month or so regarding this one darn molar! Well, I have one more appointment to put in a crown over the molar that just endured that painful route canal.  On a happier note, we celebrated Trystan’s baptism last July 4. After all the last minute preparation and anticipation of rain, the day turned out to be a great hot and sunny success. And I will email you all the pictures to prove it : ) !!!  A couple weeks ago we went up to Jamie’s Cottage for the weekend to celebrate her Annual Family Reunion. Jamie’s cottage is 2 hours away from Toronto in little wee town called Bayfield. Fun stuff, other than Darryl, JP, Trystan and I were the only other ethnic culture around ….for miles upon miles. HA!! We drove up late Friday night and left Sunday afternoon. We spent majority of the weekend relaxing and chilling. JP was soo excited to find out the cottage was on a golf course that he was awake at the crack of dawn (with the help of Trystan of course!). On Saturday afternoon we had lunch at this local burger stand… where the guys ate almost every item on the menu…and they even went back for seconds… I hate to admit this, but those chilidogs were quite tasty!! The food was soo good we picked up some grub before our long drive back to Toronto.  Last weekend, we celebrated Jamie’s birthday at a club downtown. Lucky for us the club we went to was not the Caribbana crowd we anticipated. Phew!!! However, the atmosphere is a little different now that smoking is banned from bars and nightclubs. For one to smoke in a club they either have to go on the patio or stand outside the club…(Now that’s a night of fun…hanging out in front of a club like a bunch of groupies….) On a happier note, my clothes and hair were smokeless…what a change!  As for this weekend, I intend to relax and catch up on some well-deserved R&amp;R. The past month was super busy between long hours at work and fun-filled weekends. I am in dire need of some tropical vacation!!! Anyone interested???    I   also took some time to sign up Darryl and JP to the blog… welcome!! Jamie is having technical difficulties and will probably need another invite sent to her. Do I have to hold all your hands through this process??? Geez… hahaha…. I sorry, I was just joking….  I will email all of you the pictures of my past month adventures…. Fun stuff!! Miss u all!!!

       urlLink    Pretty in Pink   urlLink     Jessica and I walk along the busy Peachtree St. on a daily basis.  I can't help but admire the manicured lawns and gardens nestled among the modern office towers.  Its like a green oasis in what would otherwise be a concrete world.   I've only been here for almost two weeks and already I'm beginning to really like it here.  I like the new and progressive vibe here.  Midtown Atlanta has great restaurants, museums, shopping and the famous Piedmont Park and Atlanta Botanical Gardens which we intend on visiting next week.  Nearby Buckhead has upscale shopping, luxury condos, trendy restaurants and more beautiful corporate complexes.   Temps have come down to a comfortable high-80s without humidity which is a nice change.  I hear the winters are very mild too.  Apparently most people put up their Christmas lights in shorts.  I can't say that I'd be offended if I never ever saw snow again.  Hee!  My girlfriend Jane who has just relocated back to her home state of New Jersey from the SF Bay Area is planning a road trip here with her family and brother next week.  They want to see everything that I've been raving about.   I'll be sure to put the digital to hard use so you can see what I'm talking about here in the ATL.

      Apparently Cin has been having problems with her Hello account and can't post pics with her blog entries. I'm wondering if anyone else is encountering the same problems. Don't despair - I think its the app and not you. Since I am the administrator of this blog (not to mention the eldest cousin) I thought I would address the situation. See - I got your back!  Another suggestion is to log into your blogger account and create a new post as you normally would. To insert a picture, click on the picture frame icon located to the right of the spellcheck icon in the toolbar above the text box. Position your cursor on the line you would like to insert your photo. This should work if the app is working properly.  On a brighter note, I'd like to welcome Darryl and JP to the blog. Thanks for joining us here guys. We can't wait to read your entries. I'm really glad that this project is going well. I really enjoy blogging (now there's a big surprise!) and reading your posts. I think we have an entire family of talented and very entertaining writers here.   Edit: I did a test on the photo insert function and the app is down. So Cin, don't kill your pc just yet. Hee!

      After three weeks of anticipation, Norm finally gave in and informed me of his "surprise" long weekend celebration. He took it upon himself to book a five star Hotel and Spa weekend getaway... spa services included! All this, with no prior coaching or training.  Estancia Hotel and Spa is located in La Jolla, just 15 minutes north of San Diego. Not only were the suites luxurious, but the grounds were gorgeous. Spanish inspired architecture, blue mosaic tiled fountains, juniper evergreen trees, rows of red bougainvillea, huge queen and sago palms...a verdant oasis.  We were greeted by courteous valet people and escorted to the front desk, where we were served champagne. We were a bit thrown off by the person helping us check in. She was bilingual and that's a plus for her line of work...Let's just say our check-in would have gone a bit quicker, if we knew Japanese. After that was taken care of, our bell hop proceeded to give us a tour of the grounds and facility, then showed us our room. I felt bad since we could have just carried our own luggage, instead of him pushing around this huge cart. I guess that's how the wealthy folk do it.  We made it a point to get some R &amp; R over the weekend. Saturday morning and well into the afternoon was spent eating, swimming and relaxing by the pool. We also indulged in a couple's massage. I was afraid for Norm, since this was his first time getting a professional massage. He was a tad bit nervous, but ended up loving it and now a firm believer of the power of touch . Now I have to convince him that manly men get facials and pedicures too. Later on that evening, we had dinner at Roy's, which offers Hawaiian-Asian fusion cuisine. How fitting it was to have dinner here for our 1 year, as we did in Maui after our wedding.  If you guys ever decide to visit Norm and I, we'll be sure to take you to San Diego and the surrounding area. We were able to visit Mission Bay, which is home to Shamu. All the beaches are beautiful there, especially Mission Cove, where you can do a bit of snorkeling and scuba. I never tire of Balboa Park, which extends beyond breathtaking gardens, but wildlife, museums, art, music and performance. There is always something happening there.  A+ for a beautifully planned weekend.  One thing I do have to mention though...The first night we were there, I jumped into the fluffy bed and dove under the smooth crisp linens. But to my utter dismay, my skin broke out into hives! Being a five star frou-frou hotel, you would think the guests would be spoiled with nothing but 500 plus thread count Egyptian cotton? I had to check the label, it read 60/40 Cotton/Poly!!! I'm not trying to act like a princess, but cotton is the only way to go. :)

      According to Martha Stewart's wedding etiquette guide, guests have up to one year from the date of the wedding to send a gift. Last Wednesday, one of my dear coworkers took that to heart. He called and informed me that he had a special "white glove delivery." A few hours later, he and another coworker showed up at my doorstep with an Adirondack love seat in stow. I was so touched by his thoughtfulness and originality! He knew that I was in the process of having the backyard done...So, he decided to spend nearly 2 days to build, sand and stain this classic wooden lawn chair for us. Isn't that so fabulous? Not only did I find this gesture  the sweetest thing ever , but it was just in time for the backyard finishing touches and our 1st year celebration.    Designer & Carpenter:  John Christenson  Style:  Adirondack Love Seat  Wood:  Pine      Side Note:  I'm ready to crush my PC!  Auuuggghh!   Hello  is not happening for me.  I'm hoping my sister can post a picture for me.

      After spending several hours shopping in the heat at the North Georgia Premium Outlet yesterday, our friends suggested having dinner at the Golden Corral Buffet & Grill.  And damn, the Southern folk know how to eat!   It took a few minutes for our heads to stop spinning at the sight of the endless selection.  But after we got our bearings, we certainly got our grub on.  Steak, fried chicken, rotissiere chicken, cornbread, baked potatoes with all the toppings, mashed potatoes with gravy, macaroni and cheese, salads, apple pie, peach cobbler - if it wasn't so delicious it would have been utterly disgusting.   With all that great southern comfort food, I don't know how most of the women around these parts can be Miss America perfect.  Atkins Diet?  What's that?  They've got great hair, perfect makeup, trendy clothes and all the right accessories, great shoes and a killer designer bag...and that southern twang!  Y'all come back now, ya hear!

      I guess I didn't feel like my summer had started until last Friday when I walked out of the college never to return as a student again. Well, technically I still have to show up at least 5 more times throughout the next year.  Long story. But it sure feels good to be free.  Powell Street Festival happens every year during the first weekend in August to celebrate Japanese cultural heritage, specifically the small population of post war Japanese immigrants to Vancouver.  There was sumo wrestling, traditional dancing, games, arts and crafts and best of all, food! I'm so hooked on this delicious dessert called imagawayaki, which is a small pancake treat with red bean paste in the tasty middle.  Standing in line for this under the hot August sun was worth my while.  Later in the day, I went to Playland, which pales in comparison to Canada's Wonderland, and I overcame my fear of coasters.  The trick is, during the free fall, open your eyes and let yourself fly off the seat a little.  (After some of the coasters in Wonderland, I didn't think I'd ever go on one again. ) I ate so well today, too. Lots of imagawayaki, cotton candy, churros, and it is only 10pm.    I conquered the fear of coasters, but I wasn't prepared for the Haunted House.  Sure it's a silly little maze with actors ready to jump up and scare you, but I forgot that I can't even sit through a horror movie I'd already seen once before.  Luckily I had someone with me to roll me out of the Haunted House.  It wasn't so bad that I covered my eyes and ears the whole time...was it?  So cousins, stay posted.  Remember that even if you have nothing to say, it is still worthwhile hearing whatever it is you have nothing to say about. Make sense? Good. Keep writing Ronald, Jun, Lovielyn, and Cin!
