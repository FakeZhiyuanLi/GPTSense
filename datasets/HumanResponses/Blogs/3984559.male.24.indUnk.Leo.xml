       	Well another boring workweek begins.  But I had a pretty good weekend so I can't complain too much.  I didn't end up seeing the "Nicas" on Friday because of the flooding caused by that crazy rain storm we had friday.  But I ended up chillin with them on Sunday for a while.  Saturday night was spent at a nice NY house party. I arrived and found  urlLink  AlexisT  . I stood there in front of her to say hi and she had a 5 second delay untill she finally realized who I was. When asked how long she had been there she responded  "too long" HA! but she was a lot of fun as usual. I spent most the night just hanging out and I met  urlLink  Jerseystyle  who has a blog that I read.   .flickr-photo {	border: solid 2px #000000;}.flickr-yourcomment {}.flickr-frame {	text-align: left;	padding: 3px;}.flickr-caption {	font: 75%;/*	color: #666666; */	margin-top: 0px;}.flickr-buddyicon {	margin-right:5px; 	vertical-align:middle;	border: solid 1px;}.flickr-postedby {	font: 75%;}  	 urlLink    	  urlLink 461568974105_0_ALB , originally uploaded by  urlLink mic4te .

       I feel pretty good today. Looking forward to a great weekend.  Hopefully it will be drama free.  It amazes me how some people just love drama in their lives.  Anyway, tonight hopefully I will be going to a "Nica" family party.  The "Nicas," also known as "the tribe" consists of my best friend and his many, many cousins. I haven't seen some of them in a while so I'm looking forward to it.  Not quite sure if I'll be doing anything afterwards.  Tomorrow night I will probably be gong to Gramercy for a Birthday party and meet up with Alexis.  I love to hang out with  urlLink  AlexisT  , she is so much fun and a great conversation.  It should be a great weekend but I try not to get my hopes up.  Don't you hate when you get excited for something and its just not that great.  We'll have to wait and see.  I've been thinking alot the past few days. I've been analyzing myself which I haven't done in a while.  I think its because I'm approaching my 24th Birthday and I'm starting to have a little quarter life crisis.  I know some of you know what I'm talking about.   urlLink  Lori from RW Back to New York  posted some interesting thoughts about this a year or 2 ago.  It's just a weird point in your life where your just trying to figure out what to do with your life.  It's kind of scary not knowing what the future holds for you. I'm not even sure what I want to be doing professionally or where I'll be.  I spoke to my friend Tina the other day, who is making crazy money doing makeup for weddings on the weekends and she just started a teaching job.  It made me think that I really need to start striving for more. I've gotten too comfortable in my little job here and I'm not challenging myself enough.  It's all about having the right attitude.  I'm trying to replace the negative, insecure thoughts with confident positive ones.  Only time will tell. I guess in the meantime I should enjoy all the great things I have going for me and realize how lucky I really am.

       Incase there are any Real World/ Road Rules fans out there reading this, I just wanted to talk about the new Challenge that is currently filming in New Mexico.  It's about a week into shooting but will probably air along side of Real World Philadelphia in the fall. So far from what I've discovered through reading other sites, is that its 18 on 18 and its gonna be another Battle of the Sexes.  5 RW San Diego peeps will be there probably due to the fact that it was  the highest rated Real World season.  Anyhoo, here’s a list of the cast as of now that I’ve gotten from  urlLink Real World/Road Rules blog  . Remember nothing is confirmed but it comes from reliable sources that has been right in the past. What do you guys think?  Girls Team: Cameran (San Diego) Robin (San Diego) Arissa (Las Vegas) Tonya (Chicago) Aneesa (Chicago) Coral (Back to New York) Ruthie (Hawaii) Genesis (Boston) Beth S. (Los Angeles) Rachel (Campus Crawl) Jisela (The Quest) Sophia (The Quest) Katie (The Quest) Tina (South Pacific) Ayanna (Semester At Sea) Veronica (Semester At Sea)  Remaining Road Ruler Remaining Road Ruler  	Boys Team: Brad (San Diego) Jacquese (San Diego) Randy (San Diego) Ace (Paris) Adam (Paris) Frank (Las Vegas) Steven (Las Vegas) Mike (Back to New York) Eric (New York) Derrick (Xtreme) Patrick (Xtreme) Abram (South Pacific) Chris (South Pacific) Shane (Campus Crawl) Darrell (Campus Crawl) Theo (Maximum Velocity Tour) Dan (Northern Trail) Mark (USA Tour 1)

       What up? This is my first official attempt to have a blog. Don't know how long this will last or how boring it will be. There are 2 main reasons I felt like doing this.   1.   I've recently come to the realization that I hold back a lot and I don’t  put myself out there enough. I'm too concerned with what people think and that’s just not how I want to be.  2.  Need something to do at work. I'm constantly checking other people's blogs so I figure I'll give it a shot.  Just want to say that I'm not a writer and can't stand when people feel it's their place to point out clerical and grammatical errors. This is just a blog not a term paper or business letter, so if you are gonna point them out for me ... don't! I will add more links, pics, etc. as I figure this out.  Now that that is out of the way, last night I watched another dramatic episode of  urlLink Nip Tuck . I can't believe how crazy this show gets. The "next week on Nip Tuck"  always looks crazier then the episode you've just seen that topped the previous one.  Great show.  I'm glad I've got Nip Tuck to look forward to on my Tuesday nights now that Real World is done and  urlLink Real World Philadelphia  premieres in the fall.  I'm such a Real World/ Road Rules fan its disgusting.

       The governor is going to speak any moment and is about to resign. More new is being released as I write, but no solid info yet. I think the signs were always there that he is a pato,  urlLink Don't you think?  To quote a line from Duece Bigalow, "I know..... IT SUCKS!"

        	 		 		 I saw  urlLink The Village  a few days ago. I must say that although most of the blogs and critics I've read have hated this movie and thought it was boring. I found it entertaining and pretty interesting. M. Night Shyamalan is brilliant  and hasn't lost his eye for directing. It wasnât scary which is the impression they give in their advertisements. None of M. Night's movies can beat The 6th Sense however I thought The Village was just as good as Signs and Unbreakable.   Caught the recent episode of  urlLink Real Time with Bill Maher  . Michael Moore was one of the guests. I'm sorry but he rubs me the wrong way. I haven't seen Fahrenheit 911 yet, not because I donât want to, but simply because I haven't had a chance to. I will probably end up renting it when it comes out and I'm sure it will be released before its election time. I must admit I am a little skeptical about it. I understand how powerful editing can be to make things look a certain way. Look at all those people that have been traumatized by their inaccurate portrayals on reality shows.  My favorite part of this show is the "New Rules." Bill Maher's delivery is just too funny. How can you not laught at:  New Rule: Cheering for Lance Armstrong doesn't make you an international cycling aficionado. Unless you can name one other rider in the Tour de France in the last 100 years, you're not a fan, you're just someone who likes it when America beats foreigners. And by the way, you're also not a tennis expert if you like watching Russian teenagers bounce up and down. You're just a perv.   New Rule: You probably can't get a fair trial for Murder if you're a rapper named "C-Murder." It's a little like finding out that the name of Kobe Bryant's accuser is "Looney McSlut." I think it is, actually. They weren't supposed to release it, but... 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink the village 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink mic4te .

        	 		 		 Chappelle  urlLink strikes up major 8 figure deal   for 2 more seasons of Chappelle show on Comedy Central. I love this show but I still think  urlLink In Living Color  was the best sketch show ever made.  Back when J'Lo was just a typical Boriqua girl from the Bronx, and Jim Carrey wasn't a bazillionaire. For now The Dave Chapelle show is the closet thing we've got, but don't get me wrong it is a great show.  		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Chappelle 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink mic4te .
