      Psalm 6 Oh Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger, nor chasten me in Your heated despleasure.  Have mercy on me, Oh Lord, for I am weak; Oh Lord, heal me, for my body is troubled. My soul also is greatly troubled; but You oh Lord-how long? Return, oh Lord, deliver me! Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake! For in death there is no remembrance of You; in the grave who will give You thanks? I am weary with my groaning; all night I make my bed swim; I dreanch my pillows with my tears. My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows old because of all my enemies. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for the Lord has head the voice of my weeping. The Lord has heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer. Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly. oh how i wish.....

      i think imna crack. actually, i almost did today. but if something like that happens again, iono if i can keep myself back. i got in a sorta-argument with my grandmother today about something totally stupid.  she wanted me to go to david's house with my cousin, but i didnt feel like going. n i was planning on going later with my mom. but anywayz, my grandmother said that i was totally changing, and that my attitude wasnt what i use to be.  thats when i shut up. i mean, i wanted to tell her that she was wrong, becuz i had always been like this, and that this is who i am, but i couldnt. i knew that i couldnt say anything, and it took everything in me to stay quiet. i dont know how i did, but thank god that i did...i dont think i could handle something like that again. tomorrow is my birthday. yay for me. not. i wish it wasnt. out of all the days in the year, june 30 is my most unfavorite day. i hate it so much.

      why do i feel like im lying to everyone? maybe becuz i am.  i wish they could see the real me, who i really am... i wish i was the only person i know. wait, that doesnt make sense. leme refraze that: i wish everyone would disappear. eveyone, as in people i know and people i dont know. like, i wish everyone would just leave me alone forever and let me do my own thing. the damn phone is ringing. who would call at 3:56 am? sumone stupid probably. UGH! i hate stupid people. i wish it were legal for us to shoot every stupid person we meet. i had another suicidal thought today. i was in the shower and i was thinking to myself, "it would be so easy to fill up the tub and drown myself". i dont know why i didnt do it. we were at universal city walk today, and i asked my mom if i could get my tongue pierced. she said no. later, i asked her if i could get a small tatoo on my ankle.  once again she said no. interestingly though, she was utterly confused as to why her perfect little daughter would ask for such things.  just wait till im 18 mom; your perfect daughter wont be so perfect then. oh god, i sound like a maniac.  i hate this. i hate being this way. i wish i could be the person everyone thinks i am.  i wish i were dead.

      uhhh....another boring day. another dreary 24 hours to waste.  im begining to understand what maral meant by chris's personality.  she said that at first, he would be best friends with u. then, it would get to the point where he totally ignores u. then, he falls in love with you. its like, all falling into place now. it totally makes sense. thank you god that i have a cousin who knows chris's personality. lol. last night was pretty interesting.  my uncle showed up around 11 ish, had sum dinner, then went to sleep.  i was like, ok...but like, the weird part was, i was taking a shower, n when i got out, i heard my uncle's voice n i was like, oh he's here.  n like, he n my mom were talking about me n stuff.  i could only hear bits n pieces, but i think they were talking about my future n where i'll prolly end up.  now how would they know where im going to end up ten years from now? the thing that really scares me is that maybe, they might try ot set me up with someone. n if that happens.....oh god no.....i mean, its totally like them to do something like that. n i know for a fact that my grandmother would definatly be all for it.  she's been asking around church lately....n she's been saying stuff like, "people see u n think, 'she would make a great daughter-in-law'"  dude, sometimes i wish i wasnt armenian.  omg i cant believe i just said that.  i totally take that back. its so cool that im armenian, but the fact that arranging marriages is so natural, i mean, dude, come on, this is 2004!!! when i was younger, i use to say that i was going to become a nun.  im begining to think its not such a bad idea.

      ahhh...things r kinda weird now...a little too weird...first of all, chris hates my guts. its like, all of a sudden, he doesnt want to see me or talk to me. n i have no idea why. second of all, yamma is gonna get his ass whooped by 5 mexican guys. once again, i have no idea why.  when he told me he was hiding from sum people, i thought it was the black guys on his street.  but its not them. personally, i think yamma is just BSing about the black guys.  thirdly,  my grandma is freaking out about me going online every night. its not like i've never been online at night before.  talk about paranoid.  anywho....thought i just might let yall know about how weird people are getting around here.  its really getting on my nerves.  i mean, i thought people in NY were crazy...they're nothing copared to the people here. or at least how the people here have become....

      my mind cant function correctly right now. like, the room feels like its tipping off to one side. its really weird. chris wants to go out with me.  and he doesnt want to go out with me. i totally empathise with what he's feeling.  cuz im feeling it too.  its so annoying.  ok the waves under my room need to stop...brain freeze....woah that was weird. chris is a total sweetie. he's like, the sweetest thing in the world. he reminds me of peter, only less bossy.  he's not as much of a "do what i say or else" kind of guy. n thats totally kewl.  OMG THIS ROOM NEEDS TO STOP TIPPING!!!! @#$%!!!!! imna just give up.  i'll figure it all out later. right now, imna drink sum coffee n then sleep.

      I NEVER GOT TO SAY BYE!!!!!  i hate him so much now.  its eating away at me.  its knawing at my flesh...its rotting my bones...its killing me...thats a nice way of putting it.  he told me to call him this morning before i leave. he made me promise i would call. n now, his phone is busy.  well u know wut? im not gonna call again today. im not even gonna call when i get back.  cuz it might be busy then too.  *sarcasm rocks* in my other journal, i said that i would stop falling in love.  becuz of this. however, im not totally in love with him. its more like a school girl crush.  but i think im just gonna stop with the whole feelings thing.  for realz. becuz i cant take it. even when im careful, something goes wrong n it throws a rush of unhealthy emotions through me, which causes me to think unhealthy thoughts, which could lead to unhealthy actions.  i have no idea what i just said, but i think it makes sense. i think.

      "You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; Every precious stone was your covering: The sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created. You were the annointed cherub who coveres; I established you; You were the holy mountain of God; You walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones. You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.  by the abundance of your trading, you became filled with violence within, and you sinned; Therefore I cast you as a profane thing out of the mountain of God; And i destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; You corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor; I cast you to the ground, I laid you before kings, that they may gaze at you. You defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your trading;  Therefore I brought fire from your midst; It devoured you, and I turned you to ashes upon earth in the sight of all who saw you. All who knew you among the peoples are astonished at you; You have become a horror, and shall be no more. Forever."  Ezekiel 28:12-19  that is so sad.  thats how im feeling right now.  nothing else can describe it.

      Isaiah 3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.  O My people!  Those who lead you cause you to err, and desroy the way of your paths. i found that verse so interesting. remind you of any person in particular?  like, a certain country maybe?  hint hint. this one really grabbed my heart though: Isaiah 1:19-20 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be  devoured by the sword.   For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.  i guess a knife is kinda like a sword? two hours of decent sleep was all i got last night.  i couldnt keep my eyes closed for more than half an hour at one time.  it was insane. we went to the mall today.  i felt so out-of-place.  i hate feeling like that. we

      suicide has been running through my head all day.  i dont know if i can take it any longer.  i woke up thinking about what i was going to do today, and the first thing that came to my head was "the knife is in the kitchen".   going to the funeral was probably a good thing for me.  i was able to let out all those tears without people thinking that i was depressed about certain things.  it was wonderful though.  crying like that.  i should do that more often...but i cant.  people would start to wonder. and they might start to ask questions.  questions are bad.

      Sweet death, I pray  Surely thou will come  To save me from this  Bitter torment of love.  Bring no pain  But this poor Soul  It craves for death  For death is sweeter than honey  And love, love is as a thorn on a rose.  A blissful life, a troubled past  Somehow i've been loved so wrong  In the darkness i weep  Secretly  In the night&nbsp;I cry  Oh the Pain  In the morning i awake  With thoughts of sweet death  Surely thou will come   i have no idea why i wrote it....but yea, its a pretty acurate description of&nbsp;what im going through&nbsp;right now...

      especially if its me. i was sooo right about yama ditching me for kristy. it happened sooner than i thought it would. but the important thing is that it happened. n he prolly doesnt even care. oh well...this is what i get for not taking my own advice.  this realy sucks...n alfi called. here's our conversation: me: hello? him: hi, its me. me: u do realize that im about to hang up on u him: yea me: ok. bye him: wait me: i've been waiting all my life. why should i keep on waiting now? him: becuz we need to talk me: i thought u didnt want to talk to me him: iono. i do. but like, sometimes u just piss me off me: ok well, lets save u the misery n i'll hang up now him: but then, there are times when u make me so happy just to be alive me: is it ok if i throw up now? alf, im really not in the mood for this. u've taken things to far...n now im afraid its to late him: i know...but im sorry. cant u forgive me? me: u know me. i always forgive people. but i dont know if i can forget this him: i know...but im sorry. cant we just put this all behind us? me: i just have one question. what made u do it? what made u go ballistic on me like that???  him: (very long puase. i thought he dropped the phone or something) i dont know me: yes u do him: i dont me: u do him: i really dont me: u really do. now 'fess up. him: i really dont know...i think ur right. i'll go. bye n he hangs up the phone  a few questions. 1)what did we need to talk about? becuz we never did. 2)why didnt he answer my question? he was avoiding it 3)what was i right about??  ok so i didnt hang up on him like i wanted to. he hung up on me. but stil...ok from now on, if he ever calls again, i WILL hang up first.

      omg i love that song by Hoobastank.  i have a few things to say. first of all, i am surrounded by bitches. male bitches...its the only way to describe them.  Yama n Alfi.  i was talking to alfi n he's pissed at me becuz i never called him or emailed him or anything after i got back from New York. excuse me, but i wasnt the one who said, "this friendship is over. dont bother calling anymore" and then hang up on me. and then, he has the nerve to IM me, not call, becuz calling would be such a crime, but he IMed me, n said he was hurt becuz i never told him i got back from NY...omg. he's gonna give me a nervouse break down. and then he goes on and on about how he thought i was better than that...and bull shit. and then he gives me the most dramatic goodbye ever...i should have saved it. lol...but anywayz, i was like, ok fine. n he's all, whats that supposed to mean? n im like, dude ur the one who's saying good bye, n this is ur second time. so like, yea.  n he gets pissed...n starts acting bitchy. i told him to go take a mytole n then blocked him. n if he calls, im just gonna hang up on him becuz he is really pissing me off n he's taking things way to far. and on top of that....yama is confusing me beyond measures...i really cant undersant him anymore...its just so confusing. so he's made kristy cry twice becuz of happiness....and why would that be a bad thing? and why would i even care??? i dont know...i dont know anything anymore...maybe this is all a mistake....maybe i should just back off n let him do his own thing. cuz i dont want to get attached to him, only to have him throw me off to the side for kristy. that would suck....so yea...maybe i really should...but i dont want to. ugh...this is so totally not cool.

      i did something very stupid today. i talked to eli. even though yama told me not to talk to him. but on the flip side, its a free country n i can talk to whoever i want to, and plus, yama isnt even my bf so he can't tell me what to do and what not to do. but something good came out of it....eli told me that yama was in love with kristy. eli called her a slut. (maybe its a regional thing???) at first i thought he was talking about me, but then he said Kristy, n i was like...ok....but what pisses me off is that yama led me on....he made me think that he loved me. but he doesnt. he loves kristy. omg listen to me...i sound so overly dramatic. like some bad soap opera. good god, why do i even bother? he's let me down so many times...this time, i doesnt bother me as much. and then.....eli said that yama never told him anythig about me except that we had fone sex once. is that all i add up to??? i got pissed then n told eli that yama was desperate, so thats why we did it. n then we talked some more about stupid stuff. but i told eli not to tell yama becuz yama would get mad. n what does he do?? he tells yama. that was smart.  n then....yama leaves a voicemail on my cousin's phone telling her that he wants to slap me. n so then i heard it. n there was someone in the background laughing or something....n yama didnt sound pissed....which is weird. n i was talking to him like, five minutes ago...n i have no idea whats wrong with him. he's like, totally ignoring me. i mean, if ur gonna ignore someone, at least let them know. n its just so weird for him...cuz he usually gets mad...n why am i even concerned?? he's being a jerk. n plus...he's done stupid stuff like this a million times, n this time, he's gone to far. he's got kristy. he doesnt need me, or want me, for that matter. melo is being a bitch. n on top of that, im getting sick and tired of running around in circles, getting no where!!

      i've practically been in tears this whole weekend. but, on the flip side, i've come to terms with myself, and with god. however, i still dont think things are totally ok between yama n me. im just about crying my eyes out right now. it hurts so much...screw love. if two people can ever really and truely fall in love and be happy, then im the queen of england. what went wrong between us? dude, just when i was begining to calm down on saturday afternoon, things started up again. garo came along...damn him. i hate this. i hate it all...i was right. i should never marry and stay celibate. and most importantly, i should abandon all of my feelings...forever...becuz everytime i feel something good, something bad ALWAYS follows, making me regret all the good feelings...so why bother? n omg...he hates it when people doubt him...i hate it when no one understands me....words cannont describe...words just simply cannot describe....

Living4ever2002 [1:07 AM]:  now i just want to be cool with u   Living4ever2002 [1:07 AM]:  and then  Living4ever2002 [1:07 AM]:  never talk to u again  Living4ever2002 [1:07 AM]:  cuz i dont deserve it for once, i acctually have a reason to cry. and i want to. but there's nothing left for me to pour out...im so emotionally drained, i cant even think straight. i cried so much last night, for no reason really. but i think i had a reason...maybe...iono. i dont know anything anymore. i feel like all my insides have been emptied out, and all i am is the outside part...

"I dont look forward and I dont look back." "What about  now?  You gotta think about now." She smiled faintly as she brushed back her long, golden hair. "Now doesn't exist."  i think she had the right idea. not thinking about now....becuz now is just too painfull...

      DAMN!!!! everyone is starting to get on my last nerve.  yesterday at the party, people kept telling me i look depressed, and they kept asking me what's wrong, and why i was sad, and why wasn't i eating anything. damn u people. mind ur own business. n then nathan comes up and asks, "are u still ur rocker self?" my rocker self? what kind of stupid ass question is that? anywho, i just told everyone i was sick, which was true. i was sick...of being interrogated like a criminal. n then my mom goes and does something stupid. she arranges for the two of us to go visit her friend on monday without even telling me. it just so happens that her friend is our comunity's matchmaker. she knows everyone, and everyone knows her. however, my mother didnt bother to tell me we were going for a visit on monday, and then afterwards, we were going to go visit some more people......for "coffee". in the armenian culture, there are three reasons to go to someone's house for coffee. 1) u have the latest gossip and u want to tell everyone, 2) u want to know everything in that person's life so u can go gossip to everyone about it and, 3) becuz u want to find a husband or wife for ur sonn or daughter.  its really pathetic. so yea, we're going to lots of people's houses tomorrow for "coffee". and my mom never bothered to tell me. i mean, i dont think i would be upset if she had told me in the begining that we were going to do this on monday, but she didnt, and thats what bugs...its like, i dont matter. who cares about me. maybe monday i wanted to go shopping instead of husband hunting--i mean, "drink coffee". its really depressing. i'm begining to not care if i get hooked up with someone....however, i would like to have a say in who im going to marry....but that seems to be out of the question. and right now my mom is calling me....so i hafta go...damn....

      i've been thinking. and i know it's a serious health hazard, but i had to take the chance. i must have been stupid or something yesterday when i wrote all that crap about drugs.  am i that desperate? i know my life sucks, but it can't suck THAT much.  and besides, yamma talked sum sense into me yesterday about that. i dont know what i would do without him. even though i cant talk to him about everything, i can talk to him about sum things, and that's totally good. i think. yea, it is. anywayz, back to what i was saying: i think i need to start reading my bible again. like, serious reading. i use to read for about an hour and a half every day. now its like, five or ten mintues every morning.  n i think thats why i've been so depressed lately. but like, yesterday, i read for about 45 minutes, and then i prayed for another half hour, and i felt so much better afterwards. i think my parents are right, my attitude is changing. but i've always felt this way about everything.  ok, maybe not always, but 've felt like this for a long time. and then theres another thing: my uncle.  he's the one who sorta got my mom so overprotective of me. i mean, like, he's always telling me what to do and what not to do and crap like that. but in new york, he was so cool. he let me do what i want, dress how i want, listen to what i want, watch what i want, and be who i want. like, he totally let me do my own thing. n i never once hallucinated that blood was dripping from the ceiling, or snakes were crawling all over my bed, or that the walls were on fire, n that was so cool. but when we got back here, he came back to his old self again...and so did i. so totally not cool. now why was he like that? i mean, i felt so comfortable with myself in NY, like, i was actually having fun. i didnt have to put on a fake smile. n then, like, he just burst my bubble n started acting like himself again.  i still dont get it. n this has been on the back of my mind ever since we got back.  why the sudden change?  it was good to get a break from it all though...even if it had to end... n then there's pastor.  alot of stuff that he's been saying has been going thru my head. like, for instance, he said that there is no such thing as an adolescent. ur either a child or an adult. theres no in-between. people our age are technically children. we just have mental problems. and since the entire generation has mental issues, people think that its becuz of our age and anybody who acts like we do is dubbed a teenager or adolescent. and if u think about it, he's right. every teenager i know has sum kind of mental problem...in sum small way or another. which is why so many teenagers commit suicide. oh and he also said that anyone who is suicidal is possessed with demons. so i guess im posessed. but i cant be, becuz im a christian, and christians cant be possessed. but if i was possessed, then wouldnt i be sacrificing cats every night and dancing naked in the streets to Slipknot?  i dont know....im just totally confused right now, like always...maybe i need an exorcism. but we dont believe that becuz we're not catholic. we're baptist. maybe pastor would make an exception for me... n then there's today. we're going to my mother's uncle's house for a fourth of july celebration thingy. the entire clan is going to be there. i hate it when our family has parties and we invite everyone who's related to us in some way or another. i mean, there's gonna be like, 78 people. n u know what that means? people are going to be talking to me all night. which means i have to put on an act again....this is really starting to annoy me. i can deal with a 45-person party, with just the immediate family. cuz some of them know i dont like to be interrogated. but i cant deal with a 78-person party, where sum of our extended family will be there, asking me question like, "when are u getting out of school?" "what college are u going to go to?" "when are u planning on getting married?" "are u engaged yet?" that last one always ticks me off the most. i just turned 16 people!! what do u think??!?!!! ohh...i just remembered...this is going to be a great opportunity for my grandmother to set me up with someone....again. damnit. i hate it when old ladies get together. friday morning, sum of her friends were over to drink coffee and gossip. i so badly wanted to stay in my room the whole time, but one of them asked about me so i had to come out...it wasnt pretty. she told me she had a grandson who was 19 and already in med school. like i care. she said that i had to come over and visit her sometime. translation: u have to come over and meet my grandson so u two can click and then get married and have 8 children. Lord, why me? i totally understand now why my mom didnt marry an armenian. and i dont blame her. actually, i admire her for that. even though it turned out ugly....but anywayz, i cant understand why she wants me to go thru the same shit she went thru. mothers are so confusing.

      i think i wanna start taking a drug.  like, acid maybe.  it would be so nice to just get away from everything for a few hours...or maybe pot...iono.  i just want to get away from it all. i want to escape, even if its only temporary. n then today, im reading this book maral gave me about this girl who's a hardcore user...she's in and out of the hospital almost everyday n yea, its pretty bad for her..but i mean, if i started using some kind of drug, i would have to be totally carefull about using it like, very rearely. i mean, i just want something to perk me up every once in a while. an upper. damn these emotions. anyone who takes drugs is probably the lukiest person...i mean, they can get away from everything for a few hours and just forget...i wish i could do that...even if it was just once.  i had another suicide episode today. i woke up crying this morning. like, i have no idea why. i was in tears for about an hour and i couldnt stop. and i so desperately wanted to hurt myself. i wanted to scream so loud that my vocal chords would rip. i wanted to flood myself in my own blood. i have no idea how i stoped myself from doing anything crazy...cuz i was going to. i really was. i had a razor in my hand...and i was crying so hard...and i kept telling myself that my life isnt worth it...that nothing is worth it...and then i lay down on my bed and just closed my eyes...and wished that they would never open...and then i saw that it was 9:30 and i needed to get going to the library. and i didnt want to go...so like always, i put away the razor, washed my face, and put on a fake smile. it was so sad...

      soo...another long lecture...this time about why i shouldnt dress the way i dress...like always, i just sat there and said nothing...like always...and people say that i stand up or myself. yeah right.  today, this one phrase has been going thru my head all day: Remember kids, its down the road, not across the street.  the only place u'll really find peace..." arg!! it was like, "SHUT UP IN THERE!!!" it was driving me crazy. so crazy, that when i was in the kitchen, i think i started hallucinating...i kept seeing blood dripping off the counter...it was so friggin weird...but theres a good thing in all of this madness: i've started sleeping normally at night. like, no more insomnia...yay?
