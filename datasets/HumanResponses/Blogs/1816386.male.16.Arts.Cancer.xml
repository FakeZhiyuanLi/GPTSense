      Sun. sun is good. i like sun. not when it burns tho. i am now counting the last days and hours till school starts. high school, my last 3 years of school, finally. I've never had a summer so packed for awhile. I wanted july to last forever, and august to quickly end. Alas it was the opposite. anyways i think i am set for school finally. all the shopping and exchanging and stuff like that. i need to find a working water gun for saturday. if not, buckets work. i am a bucket man when it comes to water fights. and using a hose is cheap, anyway u see it. I haven't had a water fight for awhile. i might be rusty. but i will win, because i am a man, not a girl. Muwahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Whatever you do, Never ever NEVER EVER put ur phone number in ur msn name. Don't copy me by making that mistake.  It's strange, the different types of phonecalls there are. I usually just get to the point if i'm asking something, or if i'm talking to a friend, we'll catch up, think of what we could do in a day or so, then hang up. Or just talk to relatives wanting to know how u are. Those are normal phonecalls. This call, was anything but normal.  First of all, kelsey made the call at morgan's house. Makes no sense. Then with alll the trumpet playing in the background it is hard to distinguish voices. I couldn't even hear the changeover to morgan. Next of all, arguing. Then, trumpet playing into the phone, a bit out of tune. Morgan then yells at out of tune trumpet playing. I then notice the absense of talking.  Aside from that i selpt in and forgot to get my band uniform. O dam, i got to go get milk from the store now. The blog is starting to take shape. Crazy morgan call aside, i think i'll be fine. High school, here i come.

      Yay I'm back home. Home never seemed so good to be at before. After all that smoke, I am still alive. I even drove through a part of the Highway that had fire on either side! They closed the highway behind us too! There were 8 Hell's Angels off their bikes taking pics of it! That's the 2nd time I have come close to a forest/grass fire while driving. Anyways I have found some good sayings along the trip, so I am gonna put up the ones i can remember. Here's one: "Having a girlfriend is like joining the army. You get a new haircut, new clothes, and you get info on a need-to-know basis." Pretty good, eh? I'll be home all week, then another weekend at my dad's. Adios/Ciao for now.

      Grandmothers are nice people. I have been visiting one of mine today. She is s very nice person. I guess people tend to get nicer and kinder in old age. But anyways I think I'm heading back to calgary tomorrow (i think). If not tomorrow, then sunday. So i'll be in-communicato (unreachable) tomorrow, sunday, and possibly monay, as my dad's internet subscription hasn't been renewed yet.  A good quote I heard today: "Pregnancy is the time period where the future has time to sink in before your life goes upside-down." -From Star Trek Voyager

      Well, I'm entering the world of Blogs. A friend of a friend of mine (jesse) told me to start a blog. So I did. The things that peer pressure can do. Well anyways I am particularly freaked at my friend's blog this morning. Here's the passage.  Taken from  urlLink http://trumpetus-geekus.blogspot.com/ :  i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.i want my scott.  Â¶ 10:28 AM   Freaky, eh? I think that I should be flattered, not freaked, but I'm freaked. That may change tho. O and btw, I'm in vancouver visiting, but returning to calgary sun or mon!

      Sorry about the gap in updates. I've been to busy or lazy to update. Well anyways Wednesday was a band day, it was good, but at A.E. Cross, not central. Thursday was the usual tiredness. Friday 1 thought kept me going all day. That was post party. Post party was really fun. There were some awards handed out, a slide show shown, a bit of our tour video was shown as well. The food was okay, it was better hot than anything. Then it was dance time. As soon as it started, Daniel became the bartender. I believe he wants to be a pro bar tender for a bit maybe. But I'm not sure. Out of stupidity, I reverted to what I usually do for dances. I found a place to hang around. That was dumb mistake #1. Dumb mistake #2 was not asking anyone to dance. And finally dumb mistake #3: rejecting to dance when I should of said yes. I am a fucking idiot! I hate myself for that. But I was a bit queasy from dinner and a lot of pop so that didn't help either. If you are ever at a dance with me, make sure I dance with ppl. Saturday was our first band camp. Very quiet physical warm up, which is really odd, except maybe for late into hell week. We really worked on music a bit, and we had a guest conductor/motivational speaker. That was a bit interesting too. He had us play in a circle and anyone could go in the middle for a bit and listen to everything. Then it was home, so I could sleep in on Sunday. Sunday we got our first piece of show music, which was cool, but my part is very boring. Half and whole notes. The first bar is all eighth notes at least. The rest of sunday was fine, altho they have us yell "pride" when we go to attention. thats it for last weekend.  Today was tiring. just a usual monday. test first thing today. well thats all for now.

      Dam, i'd never thought i'd ever have women troubles. Its not that i dont have any1 or im rejected, its just that i have waay to many to choose from. I like them all too! Arrg, i now know what a chick magnet mike feel like. Well anyways school is slow, band is picking up, and september is ending. summer is seeming more distant. Dam, i want it to be july again. I dont care if i have to work my ass off, i want july back. That was fun times. Of course next summer will be fun too!  Anyways the girl situation. there are 3 girls, and i like them all. i'm not sure if they all like me back or not, cuz i might of gotten some bad info. Whats for certain is me and jesse. The morgan problem is and always will be confusing. I do like her, but i dont know about her, yet. Then theres kim. I like her quiet a bit. Shes nice, crazy, and good looking. but i still dont know if she likes me. This is soooooooo confuzzling. i need some1 to help me with this. My dad would just give me a stupid lecture if he knew, so im not gonna tell him at all. My mom thinks im just good friends with some of these girls. And supposedly, there is this nicole person that likes me, but i havent really met her much.   If any1 knows someone who can do miracles, tell me.

      6! ^__^ Pillow! I rock!  Well morgan's party was a blast. It was pirates of the carribean themed, so that was a bit interesting. We opened some presents, ate, then left to go play capture the flag. That got boring so a few of us started playing dead. Played at the park for abit, then went back. Cynthia thinks that she broke me, but i don't think im broken. She couldn't explain it to me, she just kept laughing. Then she went and broke my skewer. She called it a stick. you get the picture. Anyways we went back and andrew and kim were having a bit of bondage. its nowhere near as bad as it sounds. anyways cynthia carmen and shannon spent a lot of time up in a tree. we watched a movie, what a girl wants. I couldn't really understand it too much, cuz there was too much talking. Then the movie ended. During the movie and untill i left i became a pillow for 6 ppl. shaela, morgan, jesse, amy, kelsey, and Nicole. I am sooo lucky.

      Sorry about the delay in blogging, i've been forgetting. So anyways stetsons was good, saw ppl i haven't seen in a bit. There contras a a bit crappy, but they're trying to get a new truck first. I've been getting music by the truckload lately. And i had a clinic at school. it helped a bit, but not too much. need to get used to ledger lines. we have a full stetsons band this year. 6 contras, 5 baritones, 25 guard. lots of numbers. Round up sounds screwed this year. no get ready for this or get it on, but they still play how the west was won. they have 4 tubas, 2 of which are morgan and kelsey. 8 tenors, huge. 4 baritones, and 7 trombones. not bad. o and 19 perc, which is insane. got a tuner today, our director for stetsons wants us all to have one. bored right now. cant wait till post party, or morgan's b-day party.

      The Tuba, a graceful instrument. A low sounding instrument. A big instrument. My Instrument!  Well I've had 2 band classes and I have already switched to tuba! We only had 1 b4, but me and 2 others switched, but 1 is still iffy. We also only had 1 french horn, and 2 ppl switched to that as well. Comm tech is a cool class. We already gonna do a video assignment and then a digital photography assignment! More in store as well. Our band uniforms are tuxedos, very cool.  Its hard to find ur old friends out of 1620 teenagers. And the fact that hallways are extremely crowded doesn't help at all. Stupid homeroom teacher gave my locker to 3 grade 11's by accident. I had to go get a new one today. Dam cant talk now talk later.

      I just realized that there is now only 2 more 1st day of schools left. What am i gonna do? Meh who cares, high school is gonna be a blast! it was really good to see all my peeps again, altho i thnk we are all taller and look a bit different. I think i am in the middle of mullet city, cuz there were thousands of mullets around me! must be the new hairstyle. and there were only 10's there today! gonna get crowded tomorrow! I didn't get lost at all, altho tons of others did. no locker troubles, no bullies or anything yet so i should be fine. for now anyways... no real band till thursday. i now officially hate thursdays more than mondays cuz i have 7am band then band class first thing!!!! banded all out! and then double classes. never ever double comm tech or band, always double english or math. our math teacher describes our second unit as the "unit from HELL!" he actually said that. my homeroom teacher is the son of another teacher at the school and its his first year too! so there's a Mr. Berry Jr. and Mr. Berry Sr.! I really miss band and having an instrument, but that will change tomorrow. still i cant wait for stetsons! i miss all my bandies and CRUBians (  HAHAHA my bro just got home, and he has all the shitty teachers! i fart in his general direction! they combined english and social into humanities at his school! he has the worst teacher for that, Mr hey look i am a jazz musician that can teach Clark. he also has Stackhouse, one of the strictest teachers in the school for math and sci! He's also in her homeroom and already got a talking to! i cant stop laughing!  Back to band. I miss all! too many names to put here. and i miss my morgan. stupid houses and streets in the way. lets just take out all the communities from Altadore to canyon meadows and just push them together. that will work fine, if it wasn't impossible. it would be nice if she moved to canyon meadows tho. i think theres a house for sale on my street too!  Well anyways i actually want to go back to school for a change! sooo much fun and stuff! 8 days to Stetsons! 24 till Post Party! Cant wait!

       Halloween = Boring? How is that possible?  It's possible. Handing out candy to 15 ppl in 1 1/2 hrs ain't fun. Anyways, I'm not sick anymore! Good for that. A lot of guys decided to crossdress today at school for halloween. And then there was the person in the shower, the kleenex box, and the I.D. card. Anyways I'm tired, so goodnight everybody. Take us home Primus! (dunno what that for, but meh)

      So I decided to take a right turn. Or if you couldn't understand the detailed version, I'm going with the less crazy one. I'm keeping names secret for now, untill i feel like it.  I am still sick. Can some1 invent a cure for a common cold in a day or 2?

      Just to let u know, that last post was just creative writing. But it did contain some truth. Here's what is real.  I have come to a decision that can change my life. I have to choose between two poeple, and I can't choose. I can't stand making one person sad. The 3rd choice is that I choose no 1 for now.   Anyways I am still sick, and i think i'm getting worse. Damn common cold. Why can't we cure it?

        Important. Please read.    A love life. Something I'd thought I'd never have. Maybe when I was 25 with a job and stuff. I never expected it to be with most of the general population. In high school.  Blogs can sometimes be good things. They keep friends informed of how they fell and what they have been doing. They can be filled with joy and fun and love.  They also can be the thing that makes a person think. The causes might be sickness, death, or love.  I say this because it is the truth.  Most guys (except movie stars and hot guys) will never ever have more than 1 person like or love him at one time. I am an exception to this case. I thought this happened before, but then I wasn't really sure of things. I made decisions on only partial information. Some of those decisions were right, some were wrong. I thought I had that all under control.  I was mistaken.  I now face the exact same thing again. But this time, I really like them both. But as the same from before, one of them wants 2 people. So now I am faced with a gigantic decision. A life-altering decision that the consequences of are unknown. Why can't I just the "eject" or "bail out button". That seems the easiest way. But I need something to drive me forward in life. Work and money aren't strong enough right now. Worst to worst, I'll maybe attempt to start again. A fresh mind. A fresh body. A different time. Different people.  What I am saying is that I have come to an intersection of life. There are 3 different directions to choose from, and the ability to have a fatal car crash. I am at this intersection not knowing what to do. I need help, guidance, from someone who knows the intersection. My family is of no help to me for this decision. I need help from my friends, the people that read this blog.  Therefore please talk to me. I am lost in a world where lost=bad. If you see me online, please make me talk. I won't feel like talking, but I need it. Please help me, your my only hope.

      Well I am still sick. I have been for a week, and it sucks really bad. Anyways last weekend was out of town band camp at vulcan. It wasn't too fun, as i only got about 6 hours of sleep both nights. Damn snoring chaperones and the always on hallway lights and the echoey gym. Plus the stupid cold as well. We got alot of work done at least. Met a whole lot of people, an found some that seem to be scaring me. they call themselves the 8 horny(or was it crazy?) bitches, and their mascot is a spiked dildo. They're woodwinds, so go figure. I truly think they tried to fatten us up at camp. they fed us 3 meals and 3 snacks a day. We did a lot of good group activities, including the senior auction, where they auction off seniors to the highest bidder. I'll be up for sale next year as a slave unfortunately. Anyways im gonna pack it in and try and get better. O and btw i'm taken for now. Who took me will stay secret for now, but things can always change.

      I contually apologise for the delays in posting. Most of the time i am too lazy to write anything. Well its just another week, but it was short and stressful. tests, marks, etc. are all jumping around. jazz clinician was cool this week. DAMMIT I WANT TO GO TO VIC LEWIS!!!! It'l be sooo much fun! (vic lewis is a high school band festival) my computer broke this week as well, so thats another reason i haven't blogged. anyhoo, friday i was driven insane by 5 12 year olds causing havoc in and out of the house. saturday was good, i got my computer back. went swimming and had supper at my aunt's. today i had to rake leaves (Blech!) b4 i could go to lloyd's to do some blading. my ankle bones, the part that sticks out, really hurt. ill never go blading for 5 hours ever again. i need to become unbored. i can play games, but then i cant talk to ppl. why cant ppl play the games i do? urg, now to go back to hating english and dreading math for the week.

      Now for the normal, non-drunk entry. It was pretty much a boring week. Wednesday at stetsons, my tuba broke. we spent about 25min trying to fix it there, but it was hopeless. I took it home and fixed it later. Thursday the U of C wind ensembe came to the school. They are soooo good. They played this Japanese/western church oppression thing, which was really good. The piccolo player seemed to be always out of tune, altho that might have been intentional. Friday i did a very odd thing. I went to Milton Williams to visit ppl. It wasn't for too long, but still, milton is a strange and dangerous place. didnt really do much at all, just talked, except for me as usual. Got my glasses fixed as well. Saturday was the epitomy of boredom. i lazed about watching tv and doing nothing. we made a fire to burn branches tho. Sunday we started the fire again using coals from the previous night! Went for a bike ride around glenmore reservior. Thx givin dinner was good as usual. I weaseled out of dish work. I had 4 glasses of wine! Mainly my mom's Sheraz from a kit, but a glass of some random white. I cant remember what happened after 7 that night. Today was total boredom. sat inside and cleaned up the playroom at my dad's. its a playroom no longer. o well, now i have a racetrack and a trainset to get rid of somewhere. Need to talk to some1. Don't call me plz unless i say u can! i dont like having phonecalls from ppl i dont really know.

      Yawn. I just woke up. I have finally gotten some sleep. This week was pretty good, and everyone has been tired, even teachers.  Tues we had clinicians in band and we had our usual guy, who is the best tuba player in calgary. He's been playing for 28 years. He has 6 tubas. Some of them have 5 valves! In english we all got fortune cookies and we had to write about them. I still don't know what to write. Jazz was tiring, cuz I had Double band earlier. Anyways wed we had another guset conductor. Dr. Hopkins must be a busy man.  Thursday was a lot better than i thought it to be. We reherse in the mornings 1 1/2 hours, then we have band class. We played for the first hour, then all the brass got sent away for the last 1/2 hour. Then in class we had a practise theory test. If you got 100%, you got the rest of the period as a spare. I did, so a few of us went outside and started playing killer (hacki-sack game). Jazz we had clinicians, which was very helpful. Jo stole my trombone! Urrg, i'll get it back for tuesday!  Friday was very ez. We finsihed off a video in english that we had been watching since wednesday. It was "The Power Of One". I think too many people died in it. Today I woke up at 12! New Record for me!

      Soo many things have happened this week, with more happening today. the rest of the week was boring, but saturday is a different story.  Saturday was the santa claus parade in Ft. Macleod. It was a short parade, and as it went on we got better, oddly enough. As well, we were given a mark time while playing and most of the band stopped. I think it was the wind that distorted the whistle blast, so we didnt hear the right one. Lunch was a real long line for food. feeding 120 ppl in a place that usually gets 50 ppl a day was kinda funny. The bus rides were kinda long, 1.5 hrs each! but i didnt mind on the way back (hint: kayla). Today im gonna see POTC at the cheapo theatres. Again with kayla. I need to figure out which gender would have a comfier chest to sleep on. ^_^ Ciao for now. Ill fill in when i get back.

       And now the U-Turn  That was really fast. Reversing everything I did with a positive effect. So anyways Cynthia just didn't want to be a gf, so now we're just friends. And me and Kayla decided to get back together. Crazy turn of events, eh? boring day today. Jazz we read a song that had high Bb and High C even! On 3rd trombone! We killed that idea.  other than that, it was boring.

       Wow, what a speed bump!  It seems that my life has hit a speed bump at 50km/H. I know that kinda sounds weird, but that's what basically happened. It was a relationship speed bump, by the way. It happened so fast that I'm still trying to figure out why everything happened. I think that the person saying that I was dating a controlling person was actually controlling me. So from now on, I make my own decisions. I will not listen to people's stupid opinions. SO anyways, on to the actual events.  Sunday my bro called Morgan for some unknown reason. Anyways she wanted to talk to me. She said Kayla had threatened her to stop liking me so that she could have me. I don't know if that's a lie or not. I'll never know what to believe, so I'll leave it at that. I told kayla and she attempted to call Morgan, but it was unsuccessful. That's what happened on Sunday.  Yesterday I got an email from kayla asking me the questions that would lead to a relationship switcheroo. It took me forever to answer them honestly, even though it was only 2 questions. So this is what happened. Last night me and kayla both agreed to stop going out and just be friends. There was no chemistry going on between us. If there was, I didn't see it. Also, I liked someone completely different. I never like telling ppl things, I like to make them guess. It's kind of fun for me, but I don't know the other side of the story. Anyways, now I am going out with Cynthia, I guess. No actual asking, I think it just happened. Enough talk about that.   The weekend was a band camp. Annoying at most, but it got worse than I thought. On Sunday we paraded outside on slippery streets. It was really bad. I could barely keep in step and kept falling behind. I hope Ft. Macleod is better.  School is dumb but unfortunately needed to get a job that pays good. I just want to stop doing pointless subjects. I mean, how many ppl are actually going to become authors, poets, or English teachers? Its dumb!  That's all for now. Maybe things will settle down soon. Stupid speed bump.

      Internet will be broken for awhile. Stupid telus. My advice: go with Shaw. They are a lot better and faster too! Waves of rehearsals and band camps now. It's starting to get crazy for Christmas. I have no idea what to get ppl for xmas. Plus I don't have too much money, so I'm sorry right now for being cheap on presents. Band camp this weekend. Fun fun (NOT!!!). These school computers are very very VERY crappy! I want to chuck them all off a cliff, or use Thermite to blow them up. There is video of a guy blowing up a computer with Thermite.  urlLink   Very cool and funny. Its part 2 of a mini series of destroying data. Click on part 2 for the Thermite. You may have to watch a bit before u see the Thermite part. To Christmas and Beyond!

      Very sorry about the long delay. Its hard to blog when u have someone calling u every night. (wink wink nudge nudge)  So the 4 day weekend was kind of dull, but at least I saw The matrix. That was really good, but I wont spoil anything for other peeps. Lots of band rehearsals that week too. Also annoying midterm. I didn't fail, but I ran out of time. Still did pretty good overall. The band room has been so crowded this week, with the woodwinds with us every day.  Braces suck, especially when u get a chain on. That makes multiple teeth hurt. And its also hard to eat with sore teeth. At least ill get mine off in January, I hope.  This weekend was Vic Lewis, and it was so fun. I actually saw a lot of people from others schools quite a bit. Lots of good performances, with the clinicians doing recitals after lunch each day. We also saw a professional concert too! There was this community band from Claremont, California. They were pretty good for meeting once a month. They played this one song called the pineapple suite. Weird name, but good music. I was only half asleep for the jazz portion. I was so tired. The bus rides were always noisy, everywhere we went. I lucked out at the hotel. I got a suite with a kitchenette and a balcony! They had fake fireplaces too. Not too much sleep was had the. I was up for 19hrs on sat, and I only got about 6hrs of sleep sat night. Stupid jazz 2 getting shafted with all the shitty call times. We had the same clinicians we usually have in jazz and concert band! That sucked a lot, but at least we knew the people.  Anyways my internet is broken at home, and I don't know when it will be fixed. If u want to really talk to me, phone me, or email me, but ill try to check at school. Stupid teachers watching us work.

I hate fundraising, so don't get me started. I have a party to go to on saturday, but i have to keep the host a secret from my dad as much as I can. me so tired, need sleep. dam school, but yay! 4 day weekend! talk later tomorrow.  Fat Bastard - Look at my neck, it looks like a vagina. Quoting Him - Look at my vagina, it looks like a neck. Don't ask.

      Again delays in blogging. Anyways I had a good xmas, got everything I wanted. It rained on xmas day too. I was out in vancouver visiting with ppl and drinking boose, coffee, and tea. didn't do much else out there. When we got back we went and did some shopping. we got a 80GB maxtor drive, which is pretty good. been doing nothing for the past few days. went to ikea and got a new tv stand to put together. but that stuff goes twice as fast when my uncle is around. he will be for awhile, cuz he has no place to live and we have space. we got all 20 james bond's for xmas, so starting to watch them all. also got monty python and the search for the holy Grail, and my bro got pirates of carribean.  On a down note i decided to break up with kayla. plz don't ask, unless u like long explanations.   well i get new years alone at home. no parties or anything. o well. please invite me to ur parties next year. i hate doing nothing!

      I know, I know, I'm getting less frequent in blogging. But blame those numerous Christmas concerts and school. Anyways, I leave tomorrow for Vancouver and a brown and possibly rainy Christmas. Good thing I get back on the 26th, because I can't sleep well in other places. Hetic week as well. 2 Christmas concerts, one of which I had to set up and help clean up. I've had little sleep in the past while, so I can easily be aggravated. No sleep till the 27th. Anyways, I'm in the middle of getting ready for my cousin's wedding, so another busy and long (but fun) day. Stupid 7:45 am flight. Ciao for niao.

      Wow, long time, no blog. Blame Band. anyways the 6th and 7th was a band camp, and then we had a dress rehersal on the 9th. concert on the 10th. I saw some ppl i havent seen in ages. I got a couple cat calls as well. They tell me i went red. I dont believe them. Anyways school band concert on the 3rd was fun. it was a really hot stage tho. and all the tuba switching. otherwise it was fun. We saw wade at the university that night too. it was freaky.  Anyways i'll be in vancouver for a brown and possibly rainy xmas. But i get to fly out, so i dont have to spend a day driving. anyways, theres nothing left to talk about. so i guess that means i should stop typing. I guess i should, shouldn't i? tell me when to stop typing. o wait, u cant talk back to me in a blog. o well. ill stop now. or now. or now. i cant decide. ok, ill stop..................................NOW!

      Interesting week/weekend. finally doing work in the shop in mechanics. doing lotsa swimming in gym (ick), with water getting in ears, ears popping, swallowing and etc... the only swimming ill really do is the waterpark kind. waterslides, wave pools, hot tubs, tube rides, etc...  BAnd has been very tense and intense. rehersal after rehersal. but only 1 preformance left now. Jazz went realllllly good. i hope we win or something. stetsons was ok, woodwinds out of tune badly, but u cant fix that. stampede sounds awsome! and loud as usual. i accidently left my watch in my tuba case, which is on the truck, so ill be wandering around not knowing the time till wednesday. spent the weekend doing absolutely nothing, except play this one game. shooting ppl and buildings can be fun sometimes. I have monday left to preform, then im done for a few weeks. stupid having to change during lunch. arrg!  I need ppl to talk to me more. I feel like an outcast a lot of the time. Mainly at school, but sometimes at band too. it just really sucks, but i cant help it. So fow now, back to band hassles and school annoyances.

      Oops! i forgot about my blog totally. Too busy with band and exams! So here;s the lowdown:  For the first part of jan, i was failing english, doing bad in school, emotional roller coaster. tried asking a person out, was a little late. then a little later asked some1 else, and now im goin out with her. Band had been my only escape.  One suday, i had a zoo adventure. It was.... interesting. and it wasnt too cold, plus lotsa ppl, and my gf so tons of fun. hehe the cave. (Don't ask)  second part of jan was ez. exams and tons of break. I got bored, and into audio editing. i have some good stuff done. so that was my project for the last week of jan.  Last weekend i got stuck on a chairlift for an hour. not too cold, but they had to get the ski patrol to rescue us. it was interesting.  This week has been all new subjects. Im gettin into mechanics, could be my career possibly. Not paying for school, but earning money and going to school. I love apprenticeship! volleyball killer on my body, and science frying my wrist from notes. social has been movies and maps so far. all in all, exciting.  so now a bit of thought. My new gf, its very iffy with her. first of all, she doesnt talk as nearly as much as some ppl. yay! no 2 hour phonecalls, yet. altho she is a year younger than me and in round-up, so i dont see her too often. i would call her, but parents arent the nicest i hear. so parents are a problem too. shes a goth and a wiccan, so that be interesting. Band is kicking into high gear for festival. things are getting together now, finally! so now off to a weekend packed with non band activities! yay, but i have to make pizzas friday afternoon/reherse. o well.  so thats whats happening. ciao for niao.

       Back By popular demand, it's scott's blog!  Well due to the overwhelming number of emails (0 emails) and other complaints (1 complaint, 1 "nice site"), this thing is gonna stay around for awhile. updates may not be regular, so if u want an update,. yell at me.  So anyways, the meat and bones of it.  Prolly the best spring break ever for me. I've never done that much stuff period! All thanks to my constantly-loving, beautiful laura. An amazing gal, and yet I'm still her first bf. Its a strange world. Saturday I spent 2 1/2 hours lookin for her place, gave up, then got the right address and watched a movie. Sunday was an adventure downtown, chinatown, eau claire, and the island. If u have never had a face massage, go for one. They feel weird, but fun. Monday, watched some movies with laura, and  fill in the blanks . Tuesday, the last samurai, with laura. Wednesday i went spring skiing. The snow is very hard and icy in the morning, but it softens up in the afternoon, and it was fun. Thursday was another last samurai, then some kind of party. friday, i got stuck with my dad, but went for a bike ride. sat was lazy day, sun too. Today, more movies with laura, more  fill in the blanks .  I've been looking thru my blog, and i want to delete parts of my life, but i can't, and i'll leave them up for ppl to see into my life. Aren't I a nice person?

      ok, dont let the scary title confuse you. they all happened, just not at the same time. so I've been busy yet again. such a surprise eh? well on to the wholesome meat of my blog  Coffee, or friday. Friday was an interesting day. First time i've taken the city bus in 6 years. 6 years ago i also had my dad to tell me how to pay and where to get off. meh, i made it to my destination, which was the Starbucks (or skcubrats for you crazy woodies. you know who you are!) by henry wisewood. Good coffee, and i met a swack of new ppl. Then a walk to chinook to eat and see van helsing, a bit cheaper thanks to some gift certificates i got at xmas but hadn't used. Its a good movie, with a very interesting angle on the whole vampire and wearwolf stor, along with frakenstein's monster, and one kick ass religious guardian/fighter/left hand of god. And in my company as usual, laura.   Rainy saturday. so sat was a bore, at my dads and all. just started moving shit from his office home. he has a nice big conference-sized dining table that barely fits now. and other than that, we rented the matrix revolutions.  Pleasureful sunday. Ok, so sunday was a bit more....interesting. there was a party at brenda's, a monty python-fest. the host and a guest went missing 3 times@! and then me and laura walked in on them 3 other times when they were joined at the mouth (think hard about that one..... NOT!). but i got a very very dark hickey that day/evening. pizza, pop, popcorn, chips, and coffee. good food, good movies, good times.  horse shit + pain = victoria day?. So today, there was a parade. that explains the pain and horse shit easily enough. not much happened, just good performance, minus the one girl losing a tuning slide in the middle of a parade. stupid horn. it starts to rain just as we leave high river. lucky us.  so now, another week of..... stuff. yippee! or something.  today's ending: band parade rest HSSS followed by mass confusion. a perfect example of wade's bad memory.

      So, i'm kinda ticked off at the use/abuse of my chatterbox.(for those of you who don't know what it is, its that thing -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> If it continues, the chatterbox will die, unfortunately.  And now my life. Band ever continues, along with school. I'm now playing in the grad band, which means 'Pomp and Circumstance' for me! whoopie! cushion! lol. But the usual school drag, and then stetsons. yay for marching around in socks on fake turf! play that funky music actually sounds quite good, but still needs work.  so it took me about 45 min to write this post, so many bloody interruptions.

      So taday was today, and i dunno.  Enough of the crazy intro, lets get to the meat of my day. Recording session for Jazz today, so it made miss school, luckily the evil periods (science and social). So that was a bit stressful, as I moved a mic when i wasn't supposed to. Good ol' smart scoot eh? I got a good punch for it, but its been done now. They still need to record all of our solos, cuz we took so much time setting up and sound checking. Then, going back and fixing tempo problems. Ug, stress bus. But all done now. Mechanics my car finally started after 5 days of electrical diagnosis. Yay for that, so now on to other stuff! Gym was football and ok as usual.  And gladly, there is no more school band rehersals, so no more waking up early or staying late. WooHoo! It also means I can worry only about stetsons now. Which makes the pace pick up, even tho I'm down to one band rehearsing. Crazy eh?  So ppl should plz tell me who they are on the little side chat box, cuz currently i don't know who u are all, or where i know u from. so plz clarify that when u post again.  and im not good for endings, unless they're stolen.

Also, please don't be mean on here, its my blog and being nasty/mean isn't cool. I can and will delete stuff on there!  So anyways, busy at band camp this week. (one time, at band camp...lol) But we got good work done, and percussion just got music last week, which is always fun. and now our show is 90% complete-ish. Now to work on music and clean it up a bit, and we're good to go. Now one last bit of school band, and I don't have to carry that stupid mouthpiece around with me.  So that's all for now folks!

      So today was...interesting and filled with experimentation. I do not post details online.  But anyways, school was such a bore, but a short bore at that. Mechanics with the electrical frustration of a car that doesn't start. Gym we went to the band room and saw a stampede showband recruitment video. Then football after. Blah blah blah science and social, then home for a fun afternoon.  Big band camp this weekend, blocking the last movement! We did some already, and did more on wednesday, but I missed that, so catch-up time! I missed alot of stuff, unfortunately. But oh well.

      Well, my blog looked too orange, and since google bought blogger, there have been more choices on what I can do, so this is the new look! Tada! I actually made some changes to it myself, adding links on the sidebar and a cool google search on the bottom. You can even search my site!  So anyways, back to my life. Lots going on, espically in band. Final concert was last night, and I WON AN AWARD!!! I kick ass!!!!!!!!! Enough rubbing it in, back on track. So the rest of the concert went pretty well as well. The 11's and 12's played these kick ass pieces, Ghost Train by Eric Whiticare, and Voodoo. Voodoo was cool, cuz they turned out the lights, and had ppl come into the audience. They had flashlights going off, and all kinds of percussion! its the closest thing to  urlLink Faeries Air And Death Waltz  that you can get.  Jazz we're recording a cd, with 4 of our songs, which is super cool. I'll let ppl listen/borrow it if they're super nice to me. Stetsons is hectic, I missed yesterday cuz of school band, and we'er fast approaching music in motion. If your interested, you can get tickets at  urlLink ticketmaster.    Soon to be 16, in 1 month, and 13 days! w00t!!   yea, so thats about it for now. try commenting on my posts, cuz i like feedback. tell me if you like the new layout.

      and yet again, i forget to blog. yea, not many ppl read this, and someone made a very evil email directed to me, trying to imitate laura. very nice person eh? heres the email for those of u who are curious. and would the owner of it pease own up to it. i know it wasnt laura, cuz it was sent when i was camping with her.  ------Start Email--------  Subject: You fucking liar.... i never went out with you  Yeah thats right you stupid fucker, i never went out with you.  You never had a girlfriend, and you probably cant even talk to a girl without jizzing(just so you know, jizzing happens when your PENIS gets HAPPY!).  On your FUCKING STUPID GAY PEICE OF SHIT WEBSITE, you said WE went FUCKING OUT! STUPID GAY PEICE OF SHIT I HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL!  the only thing that would ever go out with you is your peice of shit Tuba.  I bet you stick your millimeter peter in it every night and try to get off, but your balls haven't dropped and your dick gets stuck in the god damn spit valves.  So, in conclusion... FUCK OFF AND DIE!  Never call me again! ASS HOLE!  YOU BIG PILE OF SHIT!  Go screw the band instuctor!  Come onto him again!  Yea, THATS RIGHT! I SAW YOU COMING ONTO HIM I KNOW YOU LIKE MEN!  BITCH!   ------End email----------  What a fucking retard. whoever it is has the milimeter pecker, and is gay. Why bother insulting me? Words don't affect me anymore. i got immune to that. U might as well just own up to it, as i don't care about ur opinion.  so anyways, tons of band, and school, and laura. all good. some boring. its whatever, my life as me.

      Yea, that's right. I'm alone for my 16th. Sucks a whole bunch, but then again, my bro is gone. But then again, kim is gone :'( it sucks and rocks at the same time.  My week has had soo much work, even tho I'm not in school. I think my mom is taking advantage of slave labour. Grr. Lots of work, and more to do. That's what BBQ's do tho, they make you clean your house so it is presentable. Oh well.

      Yup, it's that time again. A chapter ends, and now I'm starting a new one. I'll clarify on the events.  I have broken up with Laura. It was a tough decision, but it was one that was eventually gonna be made. And now, school is over, minus exams. Marching band is kicking into high gear. School band has been finished for a month now, and It's almost the summer! AND MY BIRTHDAY IS ON THE 26TH!!!! WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  sorry for the sudden outburst of excitement. I was just...uh...excited. So yea, new chapter and all.  Spruce meadows last weekend. Rainy on saturday, nice with sporadic rain on sunday. it rained when we were getting our pictures done, but then let up after. And usually it was the extreme weather of the day when we were preforming, and mild when warming up. Ironic eh?  Thats about it. Today was the last day of school, so much partying was done and lots of food consumed. Helped out after school in the band room with equipment inventory/organization, and will do the same tomorrow. You could almost say I'm scoring "Brownie" points! Its an inside joke. Band teacher is Mr. Brown, so naturally, "Brownie" points.  Goodnight everybody! Take us home Primus!

      Ah yes, I haven't blogged in ages, but I'm so goddamn busy. (actually, I'm not, 'm just super lazy). So anyways, a quick admin note. Any further abuse of the chatterbox to the left, and I'll be forced to remove it. Thats the way it has to be. So don't abuse it, use it with good thought and purpose.  Ok, trying to remember what has happened. Lets start school wise.  School has been... school. Gym has been doing lots of sports like tennis, which was ok. Most of the time i was a ballrunner, also better at that anyways. Science has gone on with chem, got rid of a student teacher last week. Social has been crazy, with my teacher missing a few days here and there, and the sub we get is the biggest kid I've ever seen. he has braces, he's a harry potter fan, lord of the rings fan, simpsons nut, and just knows alot of pointless (and some topic related) information. I kinda like him. Mechanics is mechanics, lots of car detailing. I got involved with grad band, so I ended up playing all of their pieces. Ghost Train was good, for the litte work i did on it, and then i got to play Ride! ultimate song here! That is stampede's opener by the way, and its a grade 6 piece. A good challenge/ sight read-ish.  Stetsons a bit crazier. The lilac day parade was easy, and the day b4 that was a rehersal, and darnell being the dumbass he is, he didn't load his tuba on the truck, so I got stuck taking it home. The pit instructor suggested that it may be a good idea to not take it to make him learn some responsibility. Bad idea. I got a talking from wade and Jay, but other than that, not much fallout. Music in Motion was very very good this year. It rained! :-D rain is always good luck for me. We won fanfare while it was raining.  So that has been stetons, and school. And that's my life practically.

      So yea, England is in about 22 hours and 30 min or so. I'm all packed, and I may not blog for awhile. I'll be lucky if i find an internet cafe in london or somewhere.&nbsp; So Yea, hope to see ppl sometime in the near future, either at school, stetsons, or odd and random places. For those of you who care to know, I'm single, and I'm not actively looking but I do take offers up, depending on the person. I'll be lucky if I get a tour fling this year, but that looks hopeless. So yea, good summer to all, and live long and prosper.

      Lots of band, again i apologise for any breaks in blogging. Stampede parade seemsed short this year, and was very good for us. we placed 3rd overall, long time for stetsons to place in the money. went to a party afterwards, hot tub and ate. socialized with australians. very cool ppl. spruce meadows was the usual, normal loserhorse. music magic, new event. pretty good, horrible 1st mvt. big collision. rest of it best preformance ever. fanfare tomorrow, need a 90 at lest to do good at worlds, and top 6 here would be nice...  today i got a sunburn, band at each others throats. wade got a cussing from a horn player. very amusing.    I got bored today, so i took another test.    The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Fourth Level of Hell!   Here is how you matched up against all the levels:      Level    Score       Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very Low       Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Very Low       Level 2   (Lustful)   Very High       Level 3   (Gluttonous)   High       Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Extreme       Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   High       Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very High       Level 7   (Violent)   Moderate       Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Very High       Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Very High       Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Hell Test

      Well it was a very uneventful weekend, so i'll skip that. Hell week is now in full swing. Added some new horn moves in Mvt. 1. very fast and cool. did alot of drillwork, now have some colorguard coming thru a whole mess of us as we go backwards fast, and they go forwards fast. possible collisions. a few actual collisions today. someone had a brainfart and a complete pileup occured. other than that, Mvt. 1 is very clean, but not perfect, mainly minor flaws. Other than that, alot of running today. Sweatin' like a pig, not sure if pigs sweat at all.  more tomorrow of hell week activities.

      Well, as usual, I haven't blogged in a week. Very hectic, but whatever. I've moved in with my new family, band. I have a grand total of 3 days off in july. This weekend eats up two of them. Otherwise I'm not at home most of the day, morning sometimes, and evening sometimes. As of july 20th, I won't be in the country, so theres a good chance you wont see blogging until august 3, day after i get back. Btw I'm going to england for all of you who don't know that. August may also be sporadic, as I will be with my ddad, camping possibly. I'll update whenever possible. If you want to reach me now, email me. I check that regularly. In england, don't bother emailing me, I won't be able to check.  So anyways, on to past events.  Birthday was great! (woohooo 16!) I did nothing all day saturday, but I went out to dinner at moxie's with my cousin and cousin-in-law. Very nice. Good chocolate cake when I got home. Sunday, I went shopping for a present with my dad. Looked at alot of stuff, and got a wireless keyboard and mouse! v. cool and useful. the mouse eats thru batteries tho. I use my old one for games. Monday I went back to future shop and bought GTA vice city! Sweet game, been addicted ever since! also got a $20 mousepad. Super high quality, metal base with a very precise optical mouse surface, and grippy stuff on the back. Can't live without it now.  Hell week. It is like what it is named after. Hell because you're working all day in hot weather, and week because it lasts a week, sometimes chopped up, other times a whole week non-stop. This year I'm lucky. 2 days in june, then the rest starts next week and thursday is the last day. So the work done was good tho. The show is finished finally!!! We have a new parade song we're working on, called conga. Very easy yet cool. Poor trumpets, they have the melody and its fairly hard. I have no clue about perc., they still have lots of work to do on that.  Preformances so far have been canada day and ponoka stampede parade. Canada day, we missed the parade as we were stuck in 12km of traffic! took us 1 1/2 hours to get thru it! The 3rd bus was way behind so it drove on the shoulder to catch up. O well, we got free food. We did our show, after alot of mind changing due to the rain. Then off to banff, where bus 3 had to leave to go get repairs, and bus 1 had to leave to go dump its toilet. It stank pretty bad near the back, so the front was safer. Good parade, stopped in the middle to put on hat condoms (a.k.a hat guards. Mr. kuzic actually used hat comdom when talking to us!). Good parade, not sure how many drunks out there. very long troop two, about 8 min. We waited about 30 min for bus three to get back, and another 15 after that for food. Long day. Ponoka was annoying. Wake up at 5:15, load up at 6:30, leave at 6:50. A very long bus ride, and a 10am parade start. We were the first thing in the parade, so pretty cool. Really boiling hot, and the instructors didn't water us! damn them! not sure if anyone dropped out. Stupid parade, didn't tell us where judges were located, so we got 3rd out of 3 bands. Meh, its just ponoka.  I continue with hell week next week. Friday is the stampede parade, I'll be in that. The weekend is spruce meadows, so lots of rain or boiling hot as usual. Hope to talk to you all soon!

I have been for 3 days now. its rained all but today, so it kinda sucks, mainly because they won't let me outside in it. i also had nothing good to do until i got to my aunt's today. Got to see this fireworks competition finale tonight. Amazing. Kicks the stampede fireworks ass. Got to go now, its midnight here and 1 am in calgary.

      So yea, I'm back. It was the most amazing trip I've ever gone on, but it was the worst band tour in recent band history apparently. If you don't include the screwups, it was hellishly fun, interesting and exciting. I am currently in the process of doing a full write-up of my trip. Be patient and I'll see how often and quickly I can work on it. I leave to go camping in a few days, so I will be away from a computer for awhile. Email me or call me if you really want to talk to me. I will be at my dad's for a bit so email me for the ph# there. I will not post any numbers on the net again.
