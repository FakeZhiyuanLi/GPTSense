      Remember sitting by the lake Relaxing like tomorrow would  Never open its eyes,  never take the day away. Memories swimming through  My dreams, leaving  Shadows of love lost. Wishing the day would shine  brighter for you. But I remember leaving  Things the way they were With the sun hitting the window Reflecting in the mirror Shinging in my eye It looked like heaven Remember many nights Alone. Calling for happiness Sunsets, holding hands in the park. My first kiss So much bliss Remember leaving things the way they were Back there that night, sitting with you. The sun setting behind you Shades of darker blue Moving its way into my heart So much change moving with  This wind,  something to light the dark.

      I wrote a Kool poem at work today. Latley I have been working for awhile and then taking a break by writing...Kinda hoping back and forth till the poem is done...like a lame ass I then print it up and give it to any available person that I let read my poems to proof read. Not sure if it helps any. Or if they think I am lame. Probably Lame.....That's life for ya.

      It is the morning of Sun. the 23 of May. I am tired today. Why is will power such a difficult thing to get a hold of?Somtimes it takes all I can muster just to get out of bed. This weekend has sort of been a waist. Although I am not at work, so it has'nt been a complete bust. I look forward to going to the beach. Jason (my roomate and I ) always go to the same beach. We call it Poppy, but its actually a wild life refuge in Laguna. Its beautiful there. Iwill post pictures of the beach and of poppy. I hope the day moves to a more positive energy. L8er.
