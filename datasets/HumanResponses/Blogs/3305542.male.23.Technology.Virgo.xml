       Hey suckers!  I'm having a great time in Cancun.  We visited the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza on Sunday and swam with dolphins today (Tuesday).  The rest of the time has been spent relaxing on the beach and drinking margaritas and daquaries (sp?).  A person couldn't ask for more beautiful weather so far.  We have gone to the clubs each night.  They are pretty crazy.  I will post more details and some pictures once I get back as I am paying $3 for 15 minutes of Internet access and it is running out.  Later, Jeff

       I will be leaving for Cancun tomorrow.  The flight isn't until 6am Saturday, but we are flying out of Chicago so I will be leaving work early on Friday so I can drive to Sheboygan, where I will spend the very short night.  We will then drive to Chicago starting at about 2am.  I have put off all packing, so tonight will be the big pack-a-thon.  Alright, it probably won't be that big, but it sounded cool.  Anyways, I must go.  My next post should be full of fun Cancun stories, so stay tuned...

       I am taking a week of vacation, which will be spent relaxing on the beaches of Cancun.  We will be flying out of Chicago at 6:00am on Saturday, May 22 and returning a week later (2:30pm Saturday, May 29).  I am going with my friend Jamey Byom and his roommate.  Visit Jamey's site  urlLink here .  I will be spending the next couple weeks packing for the trip.  I can't wait!  I'll be sure to post the highlights of the trip.  Hopefully I can find a place to post while I'm down there.  Otherwise, you'll just have to wait.

       As you may have figured out, not a lot really happens in my life that is worth talking about.  So, in order to keep up my goal of posting at least once a week, I think I will occasionally post my rantings and ravings on various topics.  This will be my first such post.  The topic for this rant and rave is...   How many Subways and McDonalds does a town of 27069 people need? Why does Winona have 3 Subways and 3 McDonalds?  It seems quite excessive, if you ask me.  We have only one of the other restaurants, and that is plenty sufficient.  I've got no problem driving 5 minutes across town to get something to eat.  I think they need to replace a couple of those Subways and McDonalds and get some variation in this town.  Speaking of which, what idiot decided we needed yet another sub place?  We got Sandwich Company, Ebert & Gerbert's, a gazillion Subways, not to mention all the coffee houses that serve pretty much the same stuff only on bread or in a wrap instead of on a sub, and yet someone thinks we need a Quizno's.  Now don't get me wrong, I like Quizno's food.  It's just that I would much rather have some freakin variety.  Put in a Fazoli's.  Put in an Arby's.  Put in a Boston Market.  Just put in something different.  Give me a choice other than "Should I go to the downtown Subway or the east-side Subway?  Or maybe the west-side Subway?" I just needed to get that off my chest.  Thanks for listening. - Jeff

       Last Saturday was Kasey Louise's wedding to Adam.  I am glad to say that the wedding and reception/dance was suprisingly fun.  Kasey looked beautiful (of course), and seemed truly happy.  I'm glad about that.  The wedding was short and sweet.  I ended up hanging out with Candyce (my ex for those who didn't know me a couple years ago) and her friend.  I had a really good time with them.  Candyce's friend was great (too bad she is married), and hanging out with Candyce was like the good ol' days.  I hope I'll get the chance to hang out with them again in the future. As for the rest of the week, nothing important has happened at all.  Since nothing fun has happened this week, I will fill you in on the Erika from Cancun situation.  But, let me warn you, it isn't good news.  Unfortunately, I have not heard from Erika for two weeks now.  I emailed her and even left a voice mail message for her a couple weeks ago, but, alas, she has not responded.  I would be lying if I said I didn't care.  I thought she was a pretty cool girl, and was looking forward to becoming friends with her.  I guess I'll just have to be happy with the short time we had together, and hope that another girl comes into my life.   Well, that's all for now.  See ya. - Jeff

       Well, I've been back in Winona for a week now.  I forgot how nice it is to live 2 minutes from work.  I'm glad that I moved back.  Now I just need to find a girl...  Here is an update on some of the events in my life.  Monday I went out on the river with Phil (my coworker and new roommate), James (another coworker), and James's girlfriend Echo.  It was around 90 degrees so although the water was a little cool, it felt pretty good.  We went waterskiing, which was a lot of fun.  I hadn't been waterskiing since junior high, but it all came back to me pretty quickly.  By the time we quit, I was jumping over the wake and learning how to slalom.  The other major event this week happens tomorrow, when my good friend Kasey Louise gets married.  It's a shame all the good girls seem to be taken.  Well, that's it for now.  Later. - Jeff

        urlLink    We went swimming with dolphins in Cancun.  It was really cool.  We got to pet them, got a kiss (see photo above), and were pushed through the water by them (kinda like superman, but in water).  One thing to note...  their noses are really hard (kinda like an elbow) so the kisses were a little painful.

       I hope the pictures and stories quench your thirst, because that is all for the time being.  I will need to scan a picture at work of me getting kissed by dolphins.  Until then, you can see some of the pictures Jamey took at  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/byojam/cancun1.html .    Oh yeah, if you haven't guessed, I am all moved in to the new place.  And just for the record, I hate moving.  Later.  - Jeff

        urlLink    I had to post this picture because it sums up what Nick did on the trip: nothing.  He never went to the clubs with us.  He got sunburnt, so he stayed in the room for most of the days.  I just don't know why he went.  Oh well, to each his own.  Jamey and I still had a blast.

        urlLink    This is me and Erika...  which leads me to reason number two why I liked Coco Bongo the most.  I met Erika Wednesday night at Coco Bongo.  It was her first night in Cancun (with her friend).  We ended up meeting the next two nights and hanging out together.  We both left Cancun Saturday morning.  She is a great girl and I plan on staying in touch with her (she's from Michigan).

        urlLink    This is "The Strip" as seen from our hotel.  We went to several clubs: Senior Frog's twice, The City, Fat Tuesday's, and Coco Bongo.  Coco Bongo was my favorite for a couple reasons: first, it was a dance club, but every now and then a song would come on (such as the Tally Me Banana song from Beatlejuice) and performers would come out on a balcony hang from the ceiling on harnesses and put on a little show.  It was really cool.  I'll get to the second reason in another post.

        urlLink    This is the bar Jamey and I drank at almost every night before going to the clubs.  The same bartender, Victor, worked all the nights except the night I brought my camera, so I had to settle for a daylight picture without Victor.  Jamey discovered a very strong drink, Mojito, which was pretty much straight rum with a little lime juice and some sugar.  My drink of choice was lime daiquiris.  We also tried rainbow shots, lemon drop shots, and a shot called a BMW.  Good stuff.

        urlLink    Our hotel, the Riu Cancun (big one in the middle).  We left Chicago at 6am and arrived in Cancun at 10:30am.  Our hotel was excellent.  It was all inclusive, so all food and drinks were included.  The food was excellent.  The hotel also put on a show every night.  We watched two of the shows "The Perfect Date" and "The Michael Jackson Show".  The Perfect Date picked 3 couples from the audience and had them do little physical contests.  It was pretty funny.  The Michael Jackson Show was amazing.  The impersonator was excellent.

       I know I promised last week that I would post more details about my trip to Cancun once I was back.  Well, I'm back and alas, no more details have been posted.  I apologize profusely and the best I can do at this point is to make up lame excuses for my laziness.  So without further delay, here are my excuses (in no particular order):      Coming down from the high of Cancun has just got me too depressed to do anything that takes even an iota of energy     I will be moving to Winona this weekend so I have been busy *cough* packing     I don't have the pictures of the trip developed yet and I wanted to wait until I had them before posting     etc., etc.     So there you have it.  Lots of fairly legitimate reasons for you to pick apart.  Well, I must go now, but I will leave you with this...  I promise I will post the details on Cancun next week.  Adios amigos.

       I thought I would mention a new CD made for MoveOn.org called  urlLink Future Soundtrack for America . It is a compilation of many artists with lots of new material. If you donate $25 or more to MoveOn.org, you get the cd before it is released to record stores. Some of the bands included that I am interested in are:       They Might Be Giants     REM     David Byrne    There are plenty of other bands too, so check it out.    I will also take this time to let you know that TMBG are offering recordings of all their live shows from the current tour for download through their online music store at  urlLink http://www.theymightbegiants.com   They are charging $10 for the full concert in an almost unedited format.  I'm thinking I'll have to get the First Avenue show, since I didn't get to go.  Later, - Jeff

       Chad, Phil, and I had a discussion today over lunch about a person's natural hatred towards "the other guy".  We decided this takes two forms:       No matter what, we will hate our girlfriend's ex-boyfriend.  It can't be helped.  It has nothing to do with the type of guy he was.  All that matters now, is that he is "The Ex," and that is basically equivalent to "The Devil himself."     Even worse than our girlfriend's ex-boyfriend is the next guy our ex-girlfriend dates.  It is a known fact that despite never really meeting him, he has every dispicable quality known to man, if you can even call the scum a man.    Now what I find interesting about this, is that there is the possibility that in another life, either of the two guy types could have been your friend, potentially.  But this means nothing in the current state of things.  Another interesting thing is that most of the time, we refuse to use the other guy's real name.  Instead we will use some derogatory term, or in the very least, just call him "The Ex" or "The New Boyfriend" (usually when you are trying not to offend the girl).   Of course I believe this boils down to being a defense mechanism for our self esteem, but I still think it is interesting and slightly humourous.    Anyways, just thought I'd share these thoughts.  I'm assuming women do the same thing.   Let me know your thoughts on this.    Until next time.  - Jeff

       My coworker (and roommate) has taken a job in the IT department at WSU. Friday was his last official day in the office. It was a day of mourning. As a send off, Phil and I went out to the bars on Thursday with our friend Christine. It was a pretty good time. I was wise enough to limit my alcohol intake, so I felt perfectly fine the next day. I think that is the first time that I didn't feel like shit after going out on Thursday... Damn you Bullseye and your 3$ all you can drink Thirsty Thursdays.   I ran into another friend of mine, Jen (of French Is fame), at the bars and we decided we should go do some karaoke sometime. For some reason, I have this urge to do karaoke, but that will probably go away after I get booed off the stage. I also found out that Jen works in the new science building and has a master key, so I will be paying her a visit at work soon so we can explore the new building.   The good news about Phil leaving the office, is that his position is now open. If everything goes to plan, I will get his position. This is good news for me because it means I will get benefits and an increase in pay. I have to hand in my resume next week, so I'll keep you posted.

       I just wanted to remind everyone that you can and should comment on any of my posts.  I like reading them, and they give you an opportunity to tell me how you really feel anonymously (if you wish to stay anonymous).  For example, you could make a comment like "After the post on Frou Frou, I must admit I'm beginning to question your sexuality. - I {Heart} Korn" and I would never know who wrote it.  Now you try it.  I'll give you some topics...  Tell me what you thought of Fahrenheit 9/11.  Tell me how much you love TMBG.  Tell me what you thought of "Things My Girlfriend And I Have Argued About".  Give me suggestions for other movies or bands I might like.  Anything.  Now go, ye, and comment.

       for two of my favorite things have become one!!!  I am talking, of course, about the new music video created by the  urlLink homestarrunner.com  folk for the new They Might Be Giants song Experimental Film!!!  Check it out  urlLink HERE !!!  Also,  urlLink TMBG have a new rock album , so check that out too!!! Note:  You can tell I'm excited about this by my abundant use of exclamation marks!!!  And since I'm already posting, I'll add that I have recently discovered a new band that I really like (and I get much crap about) called Frou Frou (The name is French and I believe it is pronounced like Froo Froo, although I think the band is British).  They remind me of Dido meets Bjork meets [some sorta dance band].  Anyways, I think the girl has an amazing voice.  If you are a girl that likes Dido, or just a girly-man that likes Dido (like me), you should listen to  urlLink Frou Frou .  Finally... I just got done watching the movie He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not.  It is a French movie (it is subtitled) that stars Audrey Tautou (the girl from Amelie (also subtitled), one of my favorite movies, so drop what you are doing and go watch it right now if you haven't seen it already).  It was quite good.  I recommend it to everyone.  I hate it when people give away details to me before I see a movie, so I'll leave it at that.   - Jeff

       I figured I should check in and let y'all know what's up. Well, I'm still suffering from a cold or something that I got last week and my throat hurts like the dickens (just looked up the  urlLink definition  of dickens, partly because I had never had to spell it before so I wanted to make sure it was correct, and partly because I was curious what the actual definition was... apparently it was derived from the word devil). Anyways, on Saturday I went to Dan and Kim's bonfire party. Matt, Chad, and Rachel were the only friends of mine that went, but it was still pretty fun. I ended up camping there that night, along with Dan and Kim. It rained pretty hard on us Sunday morning. I just bought a new computer game called Joint Operations this weekend. I've been playing it online. It is pretty fun, you know, killing people and all. This afternoon, Phil and I went to King Arthur. I had heard that it wasn't very good, but I liked it. Then again, I like just about any movie about kings and such. Well, I am going to go play my new game now (insert nerd comment here). Later - Jeff

       Hope everyone had a great 4th of July weekend.  Mine was pretty good.  I saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  It was excellent and I recommend everyone watches it.  And if any of you are Pro-Bush, I would love to hear your take on it.  Most of my friends are liberal Bush haters (myself included).  I also saw Spider-Man 2.  I thought it was good.  I'd say it was better than the first.  On the 4th, my family had a gathering at my sister's house.  We played bocce ball and tennis.  It was a good time.  Last night, I hung out with Matt and Steve.  We walked down to this hidden little beach on the river.  We trespassed a couple times and had to jump over a fence, drank some brewdogs, built a fire, took a dip in the river in the nude, I fell in the fire, Matt broke both of his sandles, I think I bruised the bottom of my foot, I puked (not in that order)...  So it was a good time.  I spent all of today recovering.  Well, that is it for now.  - Jeff

       It was good to see the people in my class again at the class reunion, however, there are people a grade older and younger than me that I would like to have seen even more. What I would like is a giant three-class reunion.  Now, I'm not sure how that would work, because a person would end up having a reunion three years in a row...  and how do you pick which one to go to?  Maybe they just need a better way to set up clique reunions, so anyone who was in your clique could go.  The school could host a reunion every year where any clique could plan their reunion for.  Then it would be up to members of the clique to say what year they will meet again.  I guess the real problem, then, is how do you keep updated contact info.  The members of the clique would almost have to voluntarily update their info.  I don't know, maybe the whole idea is crap.  I just would like to see some other old friends again, is all.  Well, enough rambling...  I need to get back to work.

       This past Saturday was my five year high school reunion.  In some ways it doesn't seem like it has been that long, but in some ways it seems even longer.  I was a little leery of going.  To be frank, there aren't too many people from my class that I actually want to see.  Well, I was pleasantly suprised by how much fun I actually had.  Initially I was a little worried because after we got the "So what are you up to now" bullshit out of the way, there was some awkward silences (especially with people who I never talked to in high school anyway).  But after a few drinks, everyone kind of got used to each other again, and it turned out pretty fun.  About half the class showed up (so that's like 22 or 23 people) and of course Rob Timm and Eli Wortman were there.  It was good to see most of the classmates again.  I'll definitely try to make it to the ten year reunion.  It was too bad that Matt and Jamey couldn't make it.  I was also hoping Buddy would have been there.  It's been a while since I've seen him.  It would be pretty cool if at the ten year, the whole gang could make it, Gabe, Nate, Matt, and Me...  and Cole and Buddy and Mike.  That would be something.  It's been a long time since all of us were together.  I have to quickly mention that last Friday night, Chad went down to the bars with me.  I got pretty drunk, as usual, but Chad actually got pretty drunk too.  He has probably only been that drunk once or twice before.  It was a good time.  Well, I'm going to The Village now.  Later.
