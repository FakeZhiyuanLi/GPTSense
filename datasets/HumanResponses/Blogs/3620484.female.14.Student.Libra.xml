       I wrote this very very early in the morning for some unknown reason. As I was writing, I decided that it would probably be an exert from the book I'm writing. Or maybe not. I don't know, but I kind of like it.   His arms are strong. Not storng like a great warrior. Not strong like a brave fisherman or stoic ranger. Strong like him. Strong in his own perfect way. He saved me at that moment.  As I stared death in the eye, his arms took me and his voice laughed at the evil. Laughed in its face until the darkness came. A darkness so sweet and smothering that one cannot tell a difference between eyes open and eyes closed. The feeling I had then was like no other I had felt before; though I knew that I would feel it so many more times to come.  The feeling of my soul, compressed and small as a hazelnut, coming to a point at the top of my chest where my heart meets the throat. And it falls quickly, as the hand of the gods let it go, to the bottom of my heart. My heart skips a beat, my pulse pauses and secret shivers none can see pass through my body. That feeling of no match. No equal so sweet. That is when I knew it. I knew it so true and so right that no fool would dare deny it to me. I knew well. I admitted to what I had known since I first met him. Since I first heard his voice. Felt his breath. Had his touch warm mine. I knew then.   I loved him.

      I was very sad one day and I decided that lonely people should write lonely poems. So here is what I came up with.   Nights Song   Hold me ‘til the sun goes down ‘Til velvt blanket wraps us round  Hold me ‘til the its all gone ‘way “Til the world ahs closed on mans last day  Hold me ‘till the fires dim ‘Til earth and sky have silenced Him  I see not cruelty I feel not pain But with every shout I taste the rain  With battered wings And broken voice With every sob Of poor man’s choice  Hold me please Because it’s wrong To hum the words Of night’s sad song   Alone.

      I had a dream one night of a glowing silver moth in a dark abandoned church trapped in a corner. When I woke up, I wrote this poem.   Collapse   The world upon my shoulders The sea beneath my feet Take me away, for now, forever Bitter life and none to meet  The stars above are fading The grass below is dry The flam within my spirit Flickers, whispers, dies  What have I done to you, my love? And how will you react? What has the world become, my love? What whips must they still crack?  Your sun is sweet and scorching My moon is light for some Daylight fade and night breaks down My world, for darkness come  A light in chill church flickers No candle, lamp nor flame Silver moth seeks its path To escape to meet those same

       Angel Tears   I once met an angel Her hair was white and gold I asked what I should call her No reply that I was given  I asked again, the angel What she called her name It stood there silent, crying Sobbing through the rain  I asked her why it’s crying And now she looked at me She told me her sad story Her name was given ‘way  I asked her who had took it And she swallowed down her tears She looked at me and smiled Her sobs all washed away  Now I know her story And I wont tell you mine That is something for you to know When you can share our shame

      Why do we dream? Derams are such silly things that take us away on the darkest of nights or the quietest of springs. They steal our hearts and enchant our minds. Dreams. A waste of time. Will it come true? Rarely. But will I stop Dream? Never. To dream of what could be. To dream of what one is. To dream is to breathe. To live. Dreams are such silly things. But silly in the most fantastic of ways. Silly like a child's tale to make you grin on a cloudy day. Silly like the joke of a friend to take your mind of hearbreak. Dreams fuel our desire to go on. Without that desire, what would we do? Would a child still play? Would a friend still care? Such questions seem to have answers so obvious. But without the dream of pure, heartfelt joy, what would be their motivation do such things? Love. Indirectly or directly, dreams are fueled by our love to live life to the fullest, to perfection. It may take a wise man to say it aloud, but any fool knows it true. Love makes our life worth while. And such a simple thing love appears on the surface. Such a simple word that portrays so much emotion. An yet so complex. So complex that the greatest of scholars cannot put love into words known to us. So complex that the rechest of kings cannot put a price on it. So complex that one must experience love to understand it. And even then it is but a whimsy. To dream of it to go further. So is it, then, that we who love dream so full and so true? I beleive the answer to that to be both yes and no. It takes true, heart felt love to dream; to really dream. For a passionless dream is but a fraud, an act, a though suspended on spontaneous nothingness. But can it be to feel no love at all? To be so empty, so devoid of all true, spiritual meaning to have every night a black, void slumber? And to spend every spring morning going about routine as if nothing were spectacular about being alive. I hope not. For not to love nor dream nor live a life to perfection is to cease to exist. To be an empty, shattered personification of what should be. Never have I met someone who did not love. For many have their passions ill placed, but none to not love at all. And I pray, to any god that will listen, that no such preson exists. For if they do, I pity them from my souls own heart.  Yes. Dreams are silly things. But to live life ever planted beneath the soil is to never know the sun.

      I’m falling apart I’m breaking down I wish I wouldn’t Wishing I couldn’t Wishing it would stop like it all did before  Crying out to deaf ears Scream so loud But you hear the silence That sweet silence when I went away Wishing I wouldn’t come back  But it’s all gone I’m all gone With the little ways The little things Little smiles Little secrets  I wish it would all just stop Would be so easy I could stop it all now For a small price  But I refuse I refuse to fall To break Not again Not ever again  I will make it stop and take it all away

      There are days. Days of self-esteem. Days when I feel great. Days when I feel...no, when I  know  that I can do everything. That I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. I am strong. I am smart. Beautiful. Funny. Full of energy. I am unstopable. No man or woman can get in my way. I am indominable. I am unbeatable. I am a rock. No, a tiger. Something great. These are days that everybody has. Not everyday, mind you, but they are there. I am not sure where they com from. What starts or inspires them. But these come and go.  And, oh, do they ever go.  Then there are the other days. Bad days.  Really  bad days. Days when I want to crawl up and die except I know you cant because something else will most likely go wrong to stop me before I get the chance. I feel like dirt. No...I am dirt. I am lower than dirt. I am the dirt that dirt refuses. I am dirt's invisible cousin. I am slow. I am lazy. I am ugly. No, hideous. No...repulsive. I am dumb. Useless. Untalented. And I've forgotton those other days. Those good days. Those days when I feel special. Maybe I haven't  really  forgotten. Perhaps I simply refuse to remember. These days are but a blur...fluttering in and out of my concsious thoughts. Did I feel that way? Is that even possible? Me? Confident and beaming? No. I don't beleive it. I refuse to beleive it. But I must. I mean, it happened, didn't it? Why, I didn't beleive then that I could feel like I do now. And boy, do I now.  For too long that is. Too long have I felt like I do right now. I must change. I must become what I used to be. No. I will become more than that. I will be a superb human being. I will be unstoppable like a rock. Or was it a tiger? But...no. That won't happen. Sure, it's happened before. But this is  now . I can't be that. I could never be that. I don't think I ever was. No! I was. I remember, I think. But...no. Perhaps it will come to me. It has come to me before, hasn't it? If it doesn't I will die. Wouldn't that be nice? No! I can't think like that. It's bad for me. Bad for my mind. My image. I must be positive. Oh...but it's just so hard. I cant be like that. that girl. That girl wasn't me. That was a stranger. A confident, happy, energetic stranger. The kind of person I see on the street and think, "I wonder why she's so darn happy." She is radiant. Radiant. Yes, thats the word. She is radiant. She? Why the third person? Isn't this me I'm talking about? Why...I  an  radiant. Or I could be. No...no that couldn't be. That's the stranger. Yet...I feel as though that should be me. That I should be the radiant one. Yes...I am radiant. I am smart and powerful. Beautiful. No, not beautiful. Pretty is being generous enough as it is. No! I must be as positive as I can possibly be. I  am  beautiful. And nobody can make me think otherwise. And I am respected. People respect me. And treat me with dignity. I am important. And none can say otherwise. Me. Me! Important. Little nobody me. I am. I believ I am. No. I  know  I am. I dont need to beleive in something that I know that is true. It's already there. There in front of me. It is a fact. Faye...that is my Name.  Faye. Respected. Important. Beautiful. Smart.  Yes. Yes that is it exactly.       No. No who am I kidding myself?  I am  NOBODY        Yet...
