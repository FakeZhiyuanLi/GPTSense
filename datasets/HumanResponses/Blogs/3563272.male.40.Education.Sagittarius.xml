						     Whenever a bad joke is offered at work, everyone cries "Jimmy joke". I resent it of course because of the implication that all I ever serve up lack humor is completely false. Come to think of it, probably it's just that nobody ever appreciates puns, of which I am terribly fond of. Yep, punny I am. Puny I certainly am not. Whatever, I always enjoy a good laugh and here are some lighthearted moments from my kids.    ~~ 0 ~~

						   Janairo.  Genarro. Enero. Januario. Janeiro.  When asked to repeat my name, I just mention Rio and understanding dawns. After all that famous city got its name when Gaspar de Lemos on arriving in Brazil in January 1502,  mistakenly thought he had sailed into a river; thus the name Rio de Janeiro. And so we are named after the first month of the year. In Portuguese. My ancestor chose well as far as uniqueness is concerned when names were Hispanicized in the Philippines. Although one wonders how the Portuguese word was taken in Spanish colonial Philippines. Whatever, we have an uncommon name. This means that most anyone who shares our name must be family. Janairos originated from Cavite province in southern Luzon. We are a fairly large family, and by now are scattered around the country and around the world. Someday I hope I can post the family tree here. The Pampanga branch of Janairos started when I married and had to resettle in Angeles, where my wife Nai hails from. Best as I know, I am the first Janairo in Pampanga, but I could be wrong. My brother and most of my sisters still reside in Cavite, but our eldest sibling is in Washington, D.C. while my younger sister has plans to immigrate to Canada.  A friend introduced me to blogging and I saw how this could work for us to get in touch. When this gets going as intended, it could even evolve to include the whole extended family, who knows. But for now, I hope we can stay in touch through each other's blogs. Funny name, but that's what they call it.  So let me introduce myself. I am Jaime Raul Janairo, although everyone calls me Jimmy. I teach chemistry at De La Salle University-Manila. My wife is Zenaida Diamse Nacpil. Nai for short. She is currently senior manager at the Angeles branch of Permanent Plans Inc., a pre-need company. The Nacpils originated in Magalang, Pampanga, but now make their home in Angeles. Nai and I married late, but we now have two sons. Miguel will be four this November and is attending nursery school at Brightwoods; Gabriel turned two last June. We named our sons after angels, and now worry we'll never have a girl because no angel has a feminine name. Anyway, time will tell and the good Lord will have final say on that matter.  Welcome to the Janairos weblog!
