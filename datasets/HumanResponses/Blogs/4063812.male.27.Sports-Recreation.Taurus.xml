      CIMGW 2004 Preview By Chris Cardillo August 19, 2004   The Skinny  Crazy Iron Man Guy Weekend 2004. See 4 baseball games while at the same time try to stay drunk from Friday morning through Tuesday night.   The Plan  Hit the Foxy at 6AM Friday morning for Leggs &amp; Eggs. Fly to SD, find Hooters, and wait for Joel. Saturday see an LA afternoon game and a night game in SD. Sunday is the drive to SBC in SF, and Monday brings us a night game in Anaheim. Hope we can make it home.   The Predictions  None of the home teams win. I get a fever along the way. TDI says something too loud at one of the bars, in which a fight ensues. Tim passes out outside a bar in SF and gets man-raped. Steve will steal enough to make a full sized time capsule of CIMGW2004. Joel gets so drunk he thinks he is Johnny Damon and shaves off his beard.   The Play-By-Play   4:55 AM EST Friday My alarm goes off and I think I can snooze just once and I do.  5:03 AM EST Friday My alarm goes off again, and I get up, grab my bag and leave. Once I start my car, I realize I forgot my flask in the fridge. For those who can smell their own, you know this aggravates me being very lazy and having to take the key back out of the ignition. Damn it, this trip is not starting off in the right direction.  5:08 AM EST Friday I pass by The Daily Grind, my everyday coffee shop, and hoped it was open to go look for some quick good-bye buffs, but it is closed.  5:15 AM EST Friday I pull up to Buff’s Palace, and see Tim’s car there, and a light on in the kitchen. I go inside to see Tim in the kitchen drinking, and I ask him where Steve is. He tells me how he needed a drink before he bothered to worry about Steve, since the drive from his place to here was too long and he became slightly sober.  5:19 AM EST Friday Chris pulls up, Steve runs down the stairs realizing he forgot to make Buff’s Brew, and grabs whatever liquor he’s got and mixes, forcing us to drink.  5:59 AM EST Friday We arrive at The Foxy Lady in TDI’s car. He lost rock paper scissors, and bitched about it how he never wins. Tim can hardly walk, he’s hammered but we pay our $7 cover and go inside. Well, you know the old saying about going into these places, “Hey guys, what I’m doing in here’s private!”  6:43 AM EST Friday We leave The Foxy and hope we can still catch our plane. We’re all a little loopy, and we realize Tim is still inside. Rumors start flying about how he puked on a stripper during a lap dance. What a sick bastard.  7:09 AM EST Friday We pull up to the airport, and I suggest we all need a drink from the flasks to celebrate us getting this far, and nobody declines. Tim walks into the airport drinking a beer from his trusty 12-pack he certainly didn’t forget to bring. I remind everyone that if we are too drunk they won’t let us onto the plane, TDI looks at me like I’m crazy and sets up the backpacks so we can start playing cards. Tim yells at me and drinks another beer.  8:07 AM EST Friday It’s boarding time, we have a 2 on our Southwest boarding passes, which should be enough to get seats near each other but at the back of the plane. I suggest taking the far back seats so we are closest to the bathrooms, since we had an ass burning Hooters experience last night, and the last thing we want is one of us screaming in pain and Hershey-squirting all over the seats. Steve pours some flask juice into his OJ, and we all think he is brilliant and follow suit.  10:37 AM CST Friday We have landed in Phoenix for the layover. We all are too drunk to know which city we are actually in, so we rock paper scissor and I win and choose we are in Phoenix. We also don’t know what time it is and Steve insists it’s 10:37 AM CST, which is good enough for us. We find a nice bar in the airport and order some beers, and continue playing our Hold ‘Em tournament. TDI won the first round, and Tim the second.  12:30 PM PST Friday California baby! We’ve landed, and now it’s time to find Hooters. We get the minivan, then I remind everyone that we can’t get shots at Hooters so we’ll have to do a welcome to California shot at one of the bars in the airport. TDI says we should wait for Joel, and I explain he’s already in California, and thus is not being welcomed at this time. TDI drives us to Hooters, Tim in the front seat, me and Steve drinking our flasks in the back.  12:41 PM PST Friday We find a bar named Sancho and obviously we stop. Nowhere could be a better choice for our shot. We figured 4 Wise Men, but Tim said no way, so we opted for a 3 Wise Men shot. Tim took a Jaeger. Steve then tells us that being wise, we now understand the meaning of the next shot that we do for Sancho. He’s right! We will. We will what? I don’t remember. Not driving!  1:23 PM PST Friday There is the promise land! That’s right we found Hooters, I’m searching for the dumb Mexicans, but only see the hot college dropouts. We go inside, and all are amazed at how hot these chicks are! Jesse Stick 1 takes some initiative and slaps the hostess in the ass. We order 50 3-Mile Island Wings, and Steve orders 20 BBQ wings, in which Tim immediately tells the waitress how Steve is not man enough to eat hot wings. She looks at Steve, but he is just staring at her chest. The rest of the afternoon is kind of fuzzy.  4:07 PM PST Friday Joel shows up at Hooters, and we give him a huge “Hey!!!”. Joel laughs at how drunk we all are, and quickly pours himself a beer. Joel luckily was thoughtful enough to drink a small bottle of Jaeger in his car before coming in. His beard is out of control now, and I call him Grizzly Adams. Jesse Stick 2 finishes the pitcher of beer. We are all hammered and laughing our asses off.  6:10 PM PST Friday Wow, what a laugh. We leave Hooters and head back to Joel’s new condo. He tells us all the ins and outs of the place, shows us where the hot chicks live, has no answer as to why they are not in his condo, but does show us where he keeps his stash of dead hookers. Joel explains to us the best choice for killing hookers is to be sure they are Mexican, since you’re making the world a better place and they are small people, so you can fit more of them in your trunk.  10:34 PM PST Friday After a rest of more drinking and playing Asshole at Joel’s we decide it’s time to hit the bars. I bring up getting the yard of beer like Joel and I did last time, but that is shot down, but we head downtown. Tim is not allowed into some of the bars because he is wearing sneakers. We just wander around very drunk, yelling at how smelly Mexicans are.  1:04 AM PST Saturday We get back to Joel’s and rock paper scissor for sleeping places. We’ve got a bed, a cot, a couch and a loveseat. Luckily tonight, I got the couch, and not the loveseat. Just before bed, I take a monster growler, and stink up the place. The paint peels away and even the dead Mexican hookers are complaining.  4:22 AM PST Saturday Steve wakes us all up via the loudest fart you’ve ever heard. He blames it on his lactose stomach and how the weather in the west effects him differently. We decide he either has to do a shot of Charcoal Vodka or get kicked in the gonads. He chooses wisely, and I do a shot as well, followed by all. TDI insists we have time for a round of Hold ‘Em, and somehow we all agree. Joel loses, and doesn’t know yet that he was betting his condo.  8:07 AM PST Saturday Joel is awake making coffee and pancakes for us all. He doesn’t like the idea of going the whole 9 and making eggs and bacon, and TDI awakes from a dead sleep, pounds the rest of the liquor in his flask, and burns Joel’s face on the oven burners. Tim and Steve help Joel put the fire out on his beard, while TDI and myself cook the pancakes to rock hard Frisbees. We decided the best choice is to Frisbee Golf our way to the nearest restaurant for breakfast. Then we decide the Champion Award for CFG (California Frisbee Golf) is front runner in the E-Train that will undoubtedly be run, and the loser will have his breakfast cooked OVERDONE! at the restaurant.  9:24 AM PST Saturday We enter the Waffle House and Joel checks his gun at the door. Surprised that he has a gun, Steve insists Joel must be a drug dealer. Joel quickly interrupts. He tells us he doesn’t use it much anymore since he found a quieter way to kill the Mexican hookers.  9:42 AM PST Saturday Breakfast is being served when Tim stands, whacks his plate to the ceiling and yells “OVERDONE!” Joel instantly leaps for his gun and shoots the place up. Now still hungry we jump in the minivan, which unbeknownst to all, TDI has at the door with the engine running. I didn’t think a minivan could squeal its tires for so long.  11:16 AM PST Saturday We get to LA in record time. We figure we’re the least dangerous in LA, so we’re safe. Before Joel stashed his gun in the retard bus he never told us about, we stopped so he could use the bathroom. By use the bathroom he meant hold up the gas station. Of course we didn’t know this yet, he came running out with a 30rack of Millers, and that distracted us.  11:54 AM PST Saturday Dodgers Stadium is a dump. We aren’t questioning Joel buying every drink and all the food, we know he makes 7 figures and thought he was finally willing to share the wealth.  1:05 PM PST Saturday First pitch! At this point we’re half in the bag and Joel is MIA. We assumed he was buying more drinks and we had enough liquor in our flasks to hold us over.  2:58 PM PST Saturday I open my eyes and have no idea what’s going on. I soon remember I’m in LA, but wonder why Steve isn’t wearing any pants, TDI has a black-eye, and Joel is macking some grandma. Wait, I thought Joel was missing, where’s Tim? “Time to go,” I yell. We run like the flash, which was slower than a slug. Alcohol really does wonders. Steve drives us out of the parking garage, I cannot believe we didn’t tip over.  6:39 PM PST Saturday Petco Park. Qualcomm 2. I remember being there last year at the closing ceremonies of the Q, the lights were shut off and seeing greats like Ozzie Smith and Dave Winfield. I start chanting “Free hat! Free hat!” and whine about how I should have brought my Petco Field hat. Steve tries stealing a mostly empty bottle of liquor from a sleeping bum, but the bum awoke, and snaps Steve’s wrist! Steve screams in pain, TDI and myself kick the snot out of the bum, and take his liquor. TDI then tells Steve that nothing is ruining this trip, finish this liquor and forget about your wrist. Joel then tells us the bum is dead.  7:05 PM PST Saturday First pitch! We don’t care about the game and Joel and I prove that they sell shots of Jaeger for $8.50 a pop.  8:12 PM PST Saturday Steve notices it says ‘Hello Eastsidaz’ on the huge digital display in the outfield. We’re all wowed. Then it says our names, Steve, Corpse, TDI, Joel…. Be afraid! Last time you ever leave me in LA by myself! The lights go down. AHHHH!!!!  8:55 PM PST Saturday I again wake up, still in Petco, everything is OK. Everyone is drinking, Tim calls me a pussy, and I wake up. Luckily the beerman is right there.  10:46 PM PST Satruday We get to Joel’s condo and crash for a few hours. I got the bed this time!  2:07 AM PST Sunday Tim drives first on the 10 hour haul to San Francisco. The rest of us are playing some drinking Hi-Lo-Jack. The flasks turned out to be a great idea.  8:32 AM PST Sunday Breakfast time. After Steve reminding me of the 14 hot wieners I had this past week, he dares me to get a 10 egg omelet. I figure I’m on vacation, why not.  12:14 PM PST Sunday So there’s SBC. I was told that you can stand in the outfield wall at ground level. Since we only got standing room tickets, then what’s the difference? But first we need to check out McCovey’s Cove.  12:36 PM PST Sunday Steve and TDI still try to believe they’re going to jump into the cove. Yeah right, time for drinking. We end up having a couple shots each and buy a beer.  12:45 PM PST Sunday Joel says don’t jump out into the cove until the game starts to be sure you’re on TV.  1:28 PM PST Sunday Bonds comes to bat and jacks # 694 towards the cove. Steve looks at TDI and says, “Mine.” We’re like 50 feet up from the water, he runs and leaps such a distance, misses the ball and heads toward a kayak. TDI is not far behind him. They both live happily ever after, riding away in their new kayak. I told them we shouldn’t go to SF.  4:31 PM PST Sunday Joel says what we just realized, TDI had the keys. We decide to hit a bar first before checking the parking garage and hot wiring the van. I suggested this was deserving of Long Island Iced Teas. We had no choice. We stumble back to the van to see Steve and TDI drinking and playing wiffleball.  6:04 PM PST Sunday I start feeling feverish, and take some ibuprofens. We head into an Applebee’s for some drinks. Tim keeps pointing out the hot chicks and tells me every guy is gay. He says he won’t stop until I slam one of them in the pooper.  12:06 AM PST Monday We close the place, and have no idea how we’re going to find our hotel. TDI is only pretty sure that one is booked. Steve offers to take the wheel. He’s scraping cars and laughing, but we’re still moving. We pull into some hotel parking lot and get out. I don’t quite know how we got a room, or why Tim had blood on his hands.  4:12 AM PST Monday I wake up because I’m singing Disney songs in my head, dreaming of Space Mountain. Then I clog the toilet, but nobody else is awake so I leave it.  7:03 AM PST Monday OK time to unclog the toilet, everyone is pissed. They said I cannot drink until it is fixed. I fixed that damn thing in 11 seconds, grabbed the bottle of liquor and chugged. I think it’s my turn to drive.  8:12 AM PST Monday I was right, my turn. Dear God, we’re in trouble. I drive less than a mile and pull into a restaurant for breakfast. Nice. 4:25 PM PST Monday Arriving in Anaheim now.  4:29 PM PST Monday Jesse Stick 1 tried to remind us how terrible this city was, and just then we crash….  ………..  8:34 PM PST Monday I wake in a hospital, everyone is there but Tim. Joel says Tim is at the game.  11:56 PM PST Monday Tim comes back and drives us to SD. He gives us plenty of liquor, says we probable should stay in the hospital, but he knew we’d want to drink instead.  3:01 AM PST Tuesday Back at Joel’s place, time for one last game of Asshole. We all die.   The Conclusions  Attacking bums is a great way to find liquor. If the rule in Asshole is drink till you die, don’t take it literally. Wiffleball isn’t as much fun when playing with low ceilings. 4 games, 4 parks, 5 days, 5 people, 2 stick people, 1 vehicle, 1 CIMGW2004. Had we gotten T-shirts, I’m confident we’d have lived.

      	Pedro Martinez is now the heart and soul of the Boston Red Sox.  Such a bold statement can be made because his biggest competition, Nomar Garciaparra, was dealt to the Cubs several weeks ago.  Along with this trade came lots of accusations and insults tossed back and forth between Nomar and Red Sox management.  The Nation became split on the Nomar issue, and this allowed Pedro to become the number one player in the hearts and minds of Sox fans.  Pedro is held in such high esteem because of his phenomenal results throughout his career.  This is especially true when looking back at his magical run from 1998-2000.  In that three-5year period there was no better pitcher on the planet, and some would argue that it was the most dominant stretch by any pitcher in history.  To illustrate this point, here are his averages in those seasons:  20 wins, 30 starts, 5 complete games, .778 win %, 221 1/3 innings pitched, 11.55 K/9, 7.03 K/BB, 2.23 ERA, .196 AVG against, .543 OPS against  With Martinez virtually unstoppable through all this, Red Sox fans were ecstatic.  The feeling was that you were witnessing pitching history every 5 days.  Then in 2001, it all changed in a big hurry.  Pedro was diagnosed with a frayed rotator cuff and he was done for the season.  Martinez elected to rehab the injury instead of having it surgically repaired, and worried Sox fans wondered if he’d ever be the same.  In the two full seasons since then, the team was very cautious with the use of Pedro.  It seemed as though 100 pitches became his new limit, and he was given an extra day of rest whenever possible.  Pedro was still good, but not the amazing fireballer he was before the injury.   As time went on we saw him rely more and more on his breaking pitches and less on his upper 90s fastball.  In the current season, Pedro only reaches the mid-90s a few times a game and for the most part they top out at 94 mph.   Martinez was forced to evolve as a pitcher but the results were still fairly close to his career numbers.   With that said, the only nagging question was his durability.  In  2002-2003, Pedro averaged about the same number of starts as he did before getting hurt but there was a big drop in his innings average.  He pitched approximately 13% less, which is close to one inning per start.  In the eyes of many, that was a big problem.  People couldn’t see the value in having an ace that had a hard time making it to the 7th inning when his salary kept escalating: $13.5 million (2002), $15 million (2003), and $17.5 million (2004).  So Pedro came to spring training this season and added more dark clouds to a murky sky.  His velocity was barely hitting 90 mph, and he was getting knocked around in almost all of his starts.  Even before the first game of the season, the hot question for the Red Sox was “What’s wrong with Pedro?”  The fans and media wanted to know if we were going to see enough innings and pitches to make his record salary for a pitcher worthwhile.  Would we see the 6 1/3 inning Pedro who hadn’t reached the standard 200 IP in the previous two years, or could it be possible that we might once again have the workhorse who regularly went 7+?  From the start it looked like we were going to get the former and not the latter.  And then a funny thing happened.  Martinez spoke candidly with the media about the fact that team doctors told him his arm wouldn’t be at its post-injury peak until three years after the initial problem.  That statement, coupled with the weather warming up around the league, seemed to be the jumping off point for Pedro’s season.  His fastball was back up to where it had been the previous couple of years, and it seemed like maybe the fragile Pedro was gone and the Pedro of old was back!  Before we get our hopes up, let’s take a look at how Martinez has fared so far this season.  Through August 17th, Pedro has made 25 starts without missing a single one.  Assuming the rotation stays the same the rest of the way, Martinez should make 8 more starts.  If the Red Sox make the playoffs (which is a distinct possibility since my glass is always half full), then he will probably not make his last start to be saved for the ALDS.  With that in mind, we’ll say he makes 7 more starts.  That would give him 32 starts for the season, which is one less than his career high.  At the same time, Martinez has also pitched 166 2/3 innings, for an average of 6 2/3 per start.  Projecting that out through 7 more starts would give a total of 213 1/3 innings pitched on the year, which would put him just below his career average (by about 5 innings).  Based on all this, which Pedro do we have this year?  Optimists will see that he should eclipse the standard 200 IP plateau for the first time since his injury.  They’ll also mention that barring any freak injury he won’t miss a single start.  This makes you start to think that the Pedro of old could be back!  On the other hand, there is the fact that Martinez is averaging 12 less pitches per start in the three years after he got hurt than the three before.  Plus, his IP/start this year is still pretty much the same it has been the past two seasons (6.67 versus 6.54).  This would make some people say that it’s still the same new and not so improved Pedro.  Otherwise, Martinez has been fairly consistent from 1998-2004 in several other important pitching statistics, most notably his AVG/OBPSLG/OPS against.  His K/9 and K/BB are down slightly, but that is attributed to points that were made earlier about him not being as much of a power pitcher anymore.  His ERA the past two years were microscopic as always, but this year it’s a little high due to a couple of early season beatings he took.  With all the information above it looks like we have a new and different Pedro…you could say that he is middle-ground Pedro.  He’s taken some of the attributes from each “half” of his career and combined them this season.  He can now be counted on to pitch regularly and dominantly, but not as deep into games as he had in the past.  Is this Pedro worth the money he’s being paid this year?  Not quite, but if the Sox can sign him for $12-$13 million for the next few years then middle-ground Pedro is good enough for me!  Realistically, this still keeps him in the upper echelon of starting pitchers in the league.  There are still only a handful of pitchers who can match Pedro’s skill…even if he isn’t quite the same as he used to be.  Any opinions, grievances, hate mail, insults, love letters, or other feelings about this post? Was it too long, am I a stupid bastard, do I not know what I’m talking about? If anyone is out there, email me about these or any other topics. I’d love to hear if people are reading our blog and what you think of it. I can be reached at cp_tdi@yahoo.com. Two and a half weeks and counting with no emails…

      “Here’s a little story I’d like to tell about 5 bad brothas you know so well!”  Since you have taken the time to see what is on our mind, the least we can do is explain who we are.  Now before I get into it, I have to explain that this was not a consciously created organization.  Like all great things, it was not constructed, but instead, evolved.  Let me set the scene:  September.  1995.  Tucker Hall at the University of Rhode Island.  This was the site of the beginning.  I was living comfortably with my roommate Mike Richardson.  Nice guy.  He spent the majority of his time at the library, but we never saw him studying.  He just walked around and talked to people.  He failed out that semester and joined the Navy.  I digress.  Mike introduced me to the guys next door, Jay and Nick.  Jay was a good guy.  Grew up in North Providence so him and I had the “grew up in the bad part of town” bond.  I say “was” because sometime during senior year, he disappeared and has never been heard from since.  Nick was also a good guy, however, well you know what, the Nick Story is deserving of its own article.  Now, Nick had two friends, Corpse and TDI.   Now, Corpse is an interesting fellow.  There is not much this guy could do that you would say “I can’t believe he would do that.”  It probably has a lot to do with the incident that involved a coma, brain fluid leaking out of his ears, and having to learn how to walk again.  He is extremely generous, fun loving, and the greatest left-handed batter in the history of our Wiffle Ball league.  Oh, and he also has his own theme music:  “Radar Love” by Golden Earring.   TDI.  For those who don’t know, that stands for The Drunken Instigator.  Now, first off, the man is a chameleon.  He has everyone fooled, including myself.  I had a girlfriend once tell me, “I can’t believe he swears, he just seems like too much of a nice guy.”  This is the same man who once infuriated an opposing basketball player so much the guy called him a “dick fag”.  To this day, we still are not sure as to what that meant.  He offers to buy me milk shakes on warm summer days…..knowing I am lactose intolerant.  He urinated on my shoes once when I tried to take his keys away from him.  He once berated a man who had an incontinence problem in our community shower, not knowing that the man was directly behind him while we were in a crowded cafeteria.  TDI, however, is a good guy.  He is always honest, very fair, and always the optimist.  SO, the three of us found ourselves bound together by a number of things:  Our love of Wiffle Ball, RBI Baseball, and all things that alleviated us from the burdens of college life, such as classes and studying.  Oh, and one other thing….hiding from Mr. Lands End.  Mr. Lands End was another guy who wandered to our side of the building.  One day, we were going to play pool, and being the nice guy he is, Corpse asked him if he wanted to play.  Somewhere in Lands End speak, that means “follow us uninvited for the next 3 years.”  I have to imagine there will be an article dedicated to him.  He always reminded me of Cousin Oliver from the Brady Bunch.   So, this blissful union lasted for 3 years: The three of us and various members of TEEF (Tha EastSidaz Extended Family).  Then it happened.   I graduated.  To borrow a line from Dave Matthews, “Why would you care, to get out of this place, you and me and all our friends, such a happy human race?”  I don’t know, Dave, I don’t know.  I guess it was the lure of the job I had lined up.  Perhaps it was the thought of having normal hours.  But mostly, it was because I had $37,000 in school loans and the interest was about to start accruing.  Yeah, folks, you heard me, $37,000.  And to answer your next question, yes, all of it.  No money from parents.  No Talent Development.  No, “I’m the first Dutch student in my family to attend college and my dad was a piano tuner” random ass scholarship.  I’m just a plain old, poor, white, Irish-Italian.  That means my ancestors did not suffer enough, there is no national organization for me, and nobody is setting up a college fund for me.  Oh, I have to run, the Bitter Train just pulled into the station.  June, 1998.  So, I got pulled into the 9 to 5 world.  The hour-long to and from work routine really took its toll.  My mission to erase my debt was in high gear, but left little time for my comrades.  We saw each other occasionally, but it was not the same.  Then, the epiphany:  A cheap house located near work, and my friends.  November, 1999.  I move to this wonderful 3-bedroom house in Sand Hill Cove for $200 a month.  Yes, re-read that.  TDI invites me over for a little game of drinking RBI baseball, and I was back in the saddle again, thanks to our old friend Ron Castillo Spiced Rhum.  No, that is not a misprint, they spell it Rhum.  My theory is this is how they can sell paint remover for consumption.  It was like old times.   urlLink The Three Amigos :  TDI as Lucky Day, Myself as Dusty Bottoms, and Corpse as Ned Nederlander.  The night progressed with an impromptu party, and the three of us sitting in the Jacuzzi fully clothed talking about how Pedro Martinez may be the second coming of Christ.   Now things really began to take off.  We all moved around, but as it worked out, we were never more then a few miles from each other.  I was in Bonnet Shores and then Saunderstown, and they were always close by.  We began buying blocks of Red Sox tickets, and those adventures began to be legendary.  I’m sure an article or two will be dedicated to those incidents in the future, providing people actually start reading this crap.  Now for the origin of Jesse (Jags) and Tim, I had to rely on TDI (Chris) and Corpse (other Chris) for the details, as that occurred during my hiatus.  TDI Version:  Chris knew Tom and Pete from Johnston.  They knew Kyle.  Chris met Kyle this way.  Kyle was in classes at URI with Jesse.  I first met Jesse at the end of senior year when he came over to Foster Lane.  That was followed by the Drunky Summer of 99.  That was the year Jesse and Kyle started working at GTECH.  I met them then, and they started coming to Chris' Providence apartment to get hammered every night.  Jesse was friends/roommates with Tim, so Tim started coming along that summer too.  I think that's how it all started......  Corpse Version:   I don't remember what summer it was, maybe Chris can remember.  I moved In on June 1st, and stayed through September 1st.  Every Tuesday was wing night, everyone came by and got wasted, and Kyle started bringing  Jesse, who soon became the funnel master doing 15 funnels in one night I think. Jesse started bringing Tim.   Jags (Jesse) is a good man to know.  I mean, he has his own casino.  Now, were not positive, but we think he may be working for the CIA.  He tends to give vague reasons when he does not attend one of our many adventures.  Come to think of it, this whole casino might be some sort of sting operation.  He was known as The Funnel Master, until he was infected with a stomach ailment known as The GERD.  However, it only seems to cause him problems in the lower 48 states.   Tim rounds out our cast of characters.  We sometimes refer to him as “Rain Tim” due to his ability to remember virtually anything.  His ever present motto of “Come on!  I’m getting better!” can be heard anytime we mention his legendary knack for starting an argument about anything.  You won’t hear any arguments from me about him, though. He helped paint my house!  Tim is probably the only one of us left who is up for anything, even at a moments notice.  In the spirit of the American Revolution, he is a true Minute Man.....well, not according to the girls at the beach house, but I digress.   From then on it has been a revolving door of legendary events.  Trips to see different baseball parks, ski trips, and basically any other excuse we could find to get together and have some laughs.  We embark on another baseball trip in just a few days.  I have a feeling it will result in a must read article.  So, thanks for taking an interest in our stuff, and if you have any questions, I’m sure we can answer them…providing we confer with our legal representation.   Oh, and in case you wondering about my story…..well….no comment, and you don’t need to know.

      Blurb This Terry by Chris Cardillo August 12, 2004  ·	Manny is having another tremendous year, except when Ortiz is not batting in front of him.  So that’s why it makes sense to change that.  When Ortiz took his suspension, Manny’s rbi totals came to a standstill.  So why put Ortiz back in front of him?  We don’t want Manny winning the triple crown!  Why would we want that?  Seriously folks, Manny has been the clean-up for how long now?  I guess we should expect more out of a #4 guy, which is good reason for Terry to move him. ·	Speaking of Francona, he looks like a cow chewing his cud and staring into nothingness waiting to be tipped. ·	I still feel we should have gotten more for Nomar, but Meatsandwich is making some dandy plays out there. ·	When Mueller almost got that close-up throw to his stomach last night, all I thought of was my recent spleen woes due to mono, and Mueller’s front side exploding like a balloon of blood.  I knew he shouldn’t be playing second base. ·	I am not to blame for D-Day*.  Take me prisoner, torture me all you like, for the love of all that’s holy, it’s not my fault! ·	Does anyone pay close attention to what Remy actually says?  A game last week, Meatsandwich was wrongly waved home, and would have been out by a mile.  Luckily the ball got by and he scored, but Remy reiterated a handful of times, good thing he was out by a mile, good thing he was out by a mile!  Seriously, is that a good thing?  Was he being positive?  Was he just hungry for a meat sandwich?  I don’t know, I personally feel he is a wacko. ·	Listen to his counterpart Don Orsillo sometimes too.  He speaks WAY too fast.  Last week against the Tigers, the night Pedro pitched, Eric Munson of Detroit came up to bat for the third time.  Don says, “Munson flied out twice trying to bunt his way on.”  He meant he already flied out twice and now he is trying to bunt his way on, but damn slow it down!  I’m there thinking a pop out bunt happens regularly, but a fly out bunt?  Only original Nintendo’s Baseball Simulator was this possible, not real life.  I think I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt though, because I still believe RBI Baseball is real life. ·	Speaking of RBI Baseball, my article this weekend will be a preview of CIMGW2004 (Crazy Iron Man guy Weekend 2004) and the adventures of DaEvns, McGwir, Gllrga, Strwby and Mldndo. ·	I care more about how large my poop will be over how well Nomar is doing in Chicago. ·	When people say the same thing enough times, you start to believe that as the truth.  All anyone says is the Red Sox will only ever win the Wild Card.  That drives me up the wall, what happened to the positive waves that used to flow around Boston?  The players hear what the fans say, and they believe it is impossible to win the division.  With 50+ games left, we are down less than 10, and 6 more games to sweep to boost us up, we only need to win a few more games against the rubbish of the AL.  Anyone else who believes like me should let me know I am not alone! ·	Good thing we got the speedy Dave Roberts, who has not yet attempted a stolen base?  Great pickup! ·	Terry used to take players out in the 7th inning.  Let me remind you it was only the non-essential players like Manny Ramirez.  Now that we actually have someone in Roberts whom is worth using as a pinchrunner, Terry refuses to use him.  It’s like having the choice of jumping your bloody self into a pool of sharks or joining an orgy with the Patriots Cheerleaders.  There is always the chance the cheerleaders will turn out to be brain eating zombies, but for Christ’s sake, let the boy give your grandmother a bath!  Maybe Panos Patakos never told Terry that Roberts is fast.  Or maybe he did, and Terry was too busy chewing his cud to listen. ·	So I just pooped a one-footer. ·	Speaking more of poop, I have a friend who once threw out his back while taking a monster growler. ·	I wonder how my opinion of Terry is being portrayed.  The start of the season, I liked him.  The more the days pass, my stomach keeps turning, my hatred rising, I wonder if my drunken self can yell loud enough from the Fenway bleachers for him to hear me?  Only one way to find out!  And what do I care, I’ve been tossed in the first inning before.  That was not all my fault though, I blame our new friend Vodkarade, and his brother Vodkarade II. ·	Vodkarade – Approximately 6 shots vodka mixed with whatever Gatorade is left in the bottle.  You’ll hear more of our friend in future posts.  Vodkarade may even be an official member of TEEF** soon. ·	In closing – when Reese and Bellhorn are ready to return, who is going to disappear forever Craig Grebeck style?  Send me an email casting your vote, or post a comment!  I will reveal the totals next Tuesday morning.   *  D-Day – The Day that Alien who’s name begins with a D and is not to be mentioned molded himself into our lives.  ** TEEF – Tha Eastsidaz Extended Family

      In a five part series, I’ll be looking at a preview of the upcoming 2004  urlLink NFL  season. This week will be the AFC East and West. Following each team is a prediction of how they’ll do in the regular season. Of course, keep in mind that I’ve never been right in my life about anything, so take everything here with a grain of salt the size of Gibraltar. If I actually get even one team’s record right, I’ll be ecstatic. On to the previews!   AFC East    urlLink  New England Patriots   (14-2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defending  urlLink Super Bowl  champions are currently on a 15 game winning streak (including the playoffs). They added Pro Bowl RB  urlLink Corey Dillon  to try to jump start a stagnant running game. Other than losing DT  urlLink Ted Washington  to the Raiders, their defense remains relatively intact. The only serious competition in the division was Miami, and we all know how well things are going down there. They are clearly the favorites to repeat as Super Bowl champs.   urlLink  Buffalo Bills   (6-10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another horrible year in 2003, finishing tied for third place with the Jets at 6-10.  urlLink Travis Henry , their biggest weapon, played on a broken leg for most of the year. The glamour quarterback,  urlLink Drew Bledsoe , led Buffalo to the 30th ranked offense last year. The defense improved quite a bit from 2002 to 2003, however, it wasn’t enough to offset the anemic offense. The Bills brought former Steelers offensive coordinator Mike Mularky in as the new head coach. In addition to trying to get this team into the end zone more often, Mularky now has to figure out the best way to use both Henry and  urlLink Willis McGahee  effectively.   urlLink  Miami Dolphins   (5-11) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another team with a disappointing season last year, missing the playoffs, even though they had a fantastic rusher in  urlLink Ricky Williams . Since he decided that the  urlLink bananas  were more important to him than football, he’s no longer on the team. They traded for  urlLink David Boston , and he’s now out for the year with a torn ligament in his knee. They were so happy with  urlLink Jay Fiedler ’s QB play that they traded for  urlLink AJ Feeley . Yes, AJ Feeley. Needless to say, this offense is like  urlLink Harold Melvin without the Blue Notes….it’ll never go platinum!  If this team is gonna make any noise, the defense needs to play at an ’86 Bears level.   urlLink  New York Jets   (5-11) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another AFC East team not living up to expectations in 2003, going 6-10. The expectations were high after a good season in 2002, with  urlLink Chad Pennington  seemingly about to take The Leap. Preseason 2003 changed all that, however, when Pennington went down with an injury that kept him out of the lineup for the first 10 games. This offseason, they let go of some high priced free agents in  urlLink Mo Lewis  and  urlLink Aaron Beasley , but didn’t replace them with any marquee names. Their best acquisition was WR  urlLink Justin McCareins .  urlLink Curtis Martin  will have another 1000 yard season again, but if this team hopes to do anything special, it’ll be lying squarely on the shoulders of their young QB.   AFC West    urlLink  Kansas City Chiefs   (12-4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started off last year at 10-0, a fantastic start. The only problem was the defense was letting the other teams score more than  urlLink Paris Hilton  anywhere (cheap, I know, but easy. I meant the joke). The only significant addition they made was the addition of former head coach  urlLink Gunther Cunningham  to come in and be the defensive coordinator. They didn’t have the personnel on defense last year, and they sure as hell don’t have it this year either. Their only saving grace is having touchdown machine  urlLink Priest Holmes  in the backfield. But depending on his hip, he could go down at any time.   urlLink  Denver Broncos   (11-5) Wildcard &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This offseason, the Broncos decided to see if they really could churn out stud running backs whenever they wanted. They traded potential superstar  urlLink Clinton Portis  (3099 yards, 5.5 YPC in his first two years) to the Washington Redskins for superstar cornerback  urlLink Champ Bailey . The rock will now be in the hands of  urlLink Quentin Griffin  (a distant relative of  urlLink Nate Griffin ), who seems to be comfortable filling the role of the feature back. They’ve made a few additions on offense, most notably adding former Buccaneer  urlLink John Lynch  to the secondary. This team, however, will most likely succeed or fail based on how  urlLink Jake Plummer  plays.   urlLink  Oakland Raiders   (3-13) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There just aren't enough bad words to describe the 2003 Oakland Raiders. They lost their starting quarterback early in the season, and then the lost their backup quarterback later on. The clubhouse was reportedly in turmoil for most of the year. The head coach,  urlLink Bill Callahan , had lost virtually all of the respect the players once had for him. All of this showed up on the field, and the defending AFC champions had a 4-12 record. This year, they brought in  urlLink Norv Turner  as the head coach, and  urlLink Warren Sapp  and  urlLink Ted Washington  to shore up the defense. Not too many moves were made on offense, as they replaced  urlLink Charlie Garner  with  urlLink Troy Hambrick , and releasing  urlLink Tim Brown . Turner is a fantastic offensive coordinator, but history shows that he doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a franchise as a head coach. Sorry  urlLink TDI . Looks like you’re in for another rough season.   urlLink  San Diego Chargers  (2-14) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another miserable team in 2003, finishing the year with a 4-12 record. The offense is mediocre at best, even with the best running back in the league,  urlLink LaDainian Tomlinson , in the backfield. The defense allowed more than 27 points per game last year. The only significant move they made was to trade David Boston to the Dolphins. This team will be just as pitiful this year. This will most likely be  urlLink Marty Schottenheimer ’s last year coaching. It’s too bad he’s going out on such an awful note.  Next week, we’ll check out two more divisions. They could be anything, so stay tuned!

      There are 52 games left in the season, and the Red Sox are still treading water.  The obvious criticism is that the Sox need to get it in gear and end the mediocrity of the past 3+ months.  Everyone has heard it before but we’ll say it again: after a 15-6 start to the season the Sox have gone 45-44.  This is a team with a huge payroll and monster expectations.  Are the players trying too hard?  Most likely.  Are the coaches doing their best?  I hope so.  Are both to blame for a so-far disappointing season?  Definitely.  Is A-Rod a big pansy that deserved to get smacked around because he thinks he’s above the game?  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah! 	 At this point, Boston is 10.5 games behind the Yankees in the AL East.  I’m an optimistic fan, but even I can accept the fact that the Wild Card is probably the only way for the Sox to make the playoffs.  Nothing would make me happier than to see Boston go on a tear and make up a lot of ground on New York.  Especially for the fact that I have a ticket to see the Sox play the Yankees at Fenway on September 26th, their last meeting of the regular season.  Like all Sox fans I wish that game would have meaning in terms of the AL East race…but once again I’ll just be resigned to the fact that it’s another “must-win” game so Boston can slide into the playoffs through the back door.  As if things aren’t bad enough, the icing on the cake is the fact that we have to put up with Yankee fans through all the pain!  Every Sox fan knows what I’m talking about, I’m referring to “that guy”.  We all have one; it’s that Yankee fan that pisses you off on a daily basis.  They’ve got that superior New York attitude, and they can’t wait to bust your balls everyday during this torturous season.  They watch NESN religiously and always listen to Sox talk radio just to pick apart everything that’s being said.  They pretend they’re not afraid of the Red Sox, yet they seem to spend a lot of time and energy keeping tabs on them.  I truly believe that these people get more satisfaction out of hating the Red Sox than from “loving” the Yankees.  Believe me, the worst day of my life as a Sox fan was  not  the night Aaron Boone ripped out the Nation’s heart with his 11th inning home run…it was the next day when I had to come to work and face “that guy”. 	 OK, I think my meds just kicked in.  That should hold me over until next week’s therapy session.  Back to the discussion at hand!  I’m realistic and I know that the Sox need to win the Wild Card to make the playoffs.  As of right now, the Sox (60-50) are one game back of Anaheim for the lead in the Wild Card race.  Their main competition is the three teams from the AL West battling for divisional supremacy: Oakland (63-48), Anaheim (62-50), and Texas (60-50).  Cleveland isn’t that much farther behind the Sox, but I don’t think they’re a true contender at this point.  They might be leading the league in runs, but until they get some better pitching I’m going to assume that they’re also-rans.  A good analysis would probably look at the remaining schedules of all the teams in question, and a comparison of those schedules would then be made.  But who wants to make sense when we can do it my way instead?  Not me, that’s for damn sure!  I’m going to focus completely on the rest of the Red Sox season and try to make an educated guess as to how they are going to finish.  With a final record decided on, I can then craft my Sox-biased prediction on whether that will be good enough to make the playoffs.  I’ll even look at it from both sides of the fence: the Cowboy Up side (optimistic) and the Bucky Dent side (pessimistic).  OK, all of a sudden I can feel my mood drop.  I’m angry at the world and I am wondering “why me?”.  I’m like that crazy guy from the Red Sox movie who loves the Sox so much, yet can’t help but expect the worst.  I enjoy masochistic behavior, and I feel that this season will not be complete without the return of Burger Kim…the psychotic Frisbee chucker from Korea who is stealing all the money that would have gotten us A-Rod (I know, I know.  First I make fun of A-Rod and now I admit that I wish the Sox had gotten him in the off-season.  He’s a dirty Yankee now, so he deserves all the insults I can throw his way).  That’s right, it’s time to take the pessimistic look at how the Red Sox are going to do from here on out.  From this point of the view, there’s not much analysis involved: the Sox are going to keep the status quo and play .500 ball the rest of the way.  Based on that, they will limp to the finish line by going 26-26 and end the season with a record of 86-76.  Man, that would be pretty damn pathetic.  Eighty-six wins won’t get us anywhere this year.  All that would qualify the Sox for is another off-season of speculating on where everything went wrong…. just like in 2001.  This is Theo’s worst nightmare.  No playoffs would take him from zero to Duquette in a lot of people’s opinions, and that’s not a place he wants to be.  Forget about all that noise anyway!  We’re happy Sox fans, we think they’re going to turn it around and play like the team that was supposed to take us to the mountaintop!  I was fortunate enough to be at game 4 of the ALDS last year (which had to be the most electric game I’ve ever been to) and I’m hooked on that magical Red Sox post-season feeling!  Here’s a look, series by series, at how I think the Sox are going to pan out from now until the end, from an optimistic point of view:  	Tampa Bay at home, 3 games – Tampa Bay has always been the whipping boys in the AL East, but this year they’ve put together a pretty decent season.  Better yes, but good enough to beat the Sox, not really.  With three games to go after losing the opener, one would hope the Sox could win out the series.  But, the Sox can’t seem to win more than two games in a row (plus, Derek Blowe is involved) so I figure they’ll split the series and take 2 of the last 3.  60-50 plus 2-1 equals 62-51  	Chicago at home, 3 games – This will be the first meeting between Boston and Chicago this season.  The White Sox haven’t been doing so well, and if we see the Big Fat Cuban (aka Jose Contreras) then we’re guaranteed at least one win.  I say the Sox continue on a positive note and take 2 of 3.  We’re at home after all, where all that Red Sox magic gets used up… maybe they should take some of that on the road.  62-51 plus 2-1 equals 64-52  	Toronto at home, 3 games – August sees the Sox play a ton of games against weak AL opponents, and none are as good to see as the Toronto Blue Jays.  They’re in last place in the East, and the manager has already been fired after the GM has accused the team of mailing in some games.  I don’t see the situation getting any better from here on out, so I say the Sox continue their strong play against Toronto (9-4 on the season) and take 2 out of 3.  64-52 plus 2-1 equals 66-53  	At Chicago, 3 games – In this two-week stretch we see Chicago and Toronto at home and away.  After hopefully taking 2 of 3 from Toronto, I see the Sox continuing to struggle on the road.  This series is a little bump in the road but nothing to worry about.  The Sox take one game from Chicago to finish the season matchup tied at 3-3.  66-53 plus 1-2 equals 67-55  	At Toronto, 3 games – We just saw our good friends the Blue Jays at home, and now we see them one series later at their place.  I see the Sox sweeping their first away series since that fateful one in NY at the end of April.  I mean come on; it’s got to happen again at some point, right?  Why not now?  This is Canada we’re talking about here, they don’t have much going for them: the Expos are being moved, the Blue Jays are horrible, and hockey is shut down for who knows how long.  The country’s only bright spots are pretty much only Montreal, the male mecca, and Whistler Mountain.  Whoa, off on a tangent there, let’s move on… 67-55 plus 3-0 equals 70-55  	Detroit at home, 4 games – Here we have another sub-.500 team for the Sox to beat around.  The series in Detroit was a little scary, with the Sox barely pulling off two wins.  When Wakey gives up six dingers and the Sox still win, you know some crazy stuff is going down.  So the Sox should spank ‘em, but instead they split to piss us off.  To add insult to injury, Detroit brings an actual tiger along and releases it into the stands after the end of the last game.  No one is hurt except flamboyant men in white jumpsuits.  It’s Montecore’s revenge!  70-55 plus 2-2 equal 72-57  	Anaheim at home, 3 games – The evil Angels come to town for a three game set in the beginning of September.  They’ve had our number so far this year, but I think this time the Sox get the upper hand.  Nothing crazy, just another workman-like series win of 2 games to 1.  72-57 plus 2-1 equals 74-58  	Texas at home, 3 games – Here’s another AL West team that has had their way with us so far this year.  They started the run of crappy Sox play with an early May sweep in Texas.  I predicted we’d get the better of the Angels this time around, but I think the Rangers starters hold on long enough to let their bullpen and hitters do the trick.  We squeak out one to make it almost respectable…another page from the Imaginary TDI Justice Files: At the end of the series, Boston gangs up on John Wasdin in the players’ parking lot to make up for past sins.  His body is burned in front of the stadium, and surprisingly no one cares.  Jose Canseco can he heard laughing softly in the distance.  74-58 plus 1-2 equals 75-60  	At Oakland, 3 games – Finally, the one AL West team that we’ve dominated so far this year.  Maybe Derek Lowe’s crotch shot in last year’s ALDS is still affecting them since the Sox are playing them to the tune of 5 games to 1.  The Sox take 2 of 3 and we hear a lot more Oakland whining about why the Sox are evil instead of focusing on why they choke in the clutch.  75-60 plus 2-1 equals 77-61  	At Seattle, 4 games – After hopefully winning 2of 3 against Oakland, I think this is the spot in the season where the Sox make their late season surge to make things interesting.  They take 3 out of 4 from Seattle and the Nation goes into full frenzy after a 5-2 West Coast road trip.  Bret Boone does the right thing and agrees to kill his brother on behalf of Red Sox fans worldwide.  77-61 plus 3-1 equals 80-62  	Tampa Bay at home, 3 games – The Sox are back at Friendly Fenway after a monster road trip.  Everyone is clicking on all cylinders, and the Sox make short work of the Devil Rays.  Once again, Derek Blowe is probably involved so the D-Rays end up winning one of the games.  80-62 plus 2-1 equals 82-63  	At New York, 3 games – The Sox have won three series in a row, and it’s time for a reality check from the worst team possible.  They win the first game, but have the next two stolen away by Yankee comebacks.  82-63 plus 1-2 equals 83-65  	Baltimore at home, 4 games – I don’t know what it is, but the Orioles are that one team that the Sox have had a tough time with the past two years.  The Sox are probably a little hung over from the sting of the Yankees series, so they split this one with Baltimore.  83-65 plus 2-2 equals 85-67  	New York at home, 3 games – This is the last home series of the season against the Evil Empire.  The Sox are probably in a close race for the Wild Card at this point, and they find the strength they need to take 2 games from the Yankees.  The star attraction of this series is the weak Yankees starting rotation.  A special appearance is also made by the overworked Yankees bullpen.  I figure Mariano Rivera’s arm comes flying off in this series due to him being used for the 100th time this season.  85-67 plus 2-1 equals 87-68  	At Tampa Bay, 3 games – The Devil Rays suck, the Sox are/should be good, I’m sick of talking about them.  Sox take all 3 and Pedro challenges Don Zimmer to a steel cage match during the 7th inning stretch of game 2.  87-68 plus 3-0 equals 90-68          At Baltimore, 4 games – Come on, it’s the Orioles.  They can’t treat us like a redheaded stepchild forever.  Sox finish the season by getting the monkey off their back and winning 3 out of 4 games.  90-68 plus 3-1 equals 93-69  OK, so let’s take a look back at the extensive optimistic opinion.  Boston goes 33-19 (.635 winning percentage) to finish the season strong at 93-69.  Is this enough to make the playoffs, even though they’re down two wins from the previous year?  At this point, I’m going to have to say that it is.  The AL West teams should beat up on each other enough so that no one streaks ahead, and the Sox will hopefully take advantage of the easy schedule with lots of home games.  I’d have to say that this scenario would end up having the Sox battle for the Wild Card all the way to the wire.  Not the season we expected, but all that matters is making it to the playoffs.  I have to admit that I much prefer the way the optimistic scenario plays out instead of the negative one. The glass is never half empty for Tha Eastsidaz!  In any case, I hope you enjoyed my “scientific” take on the rest of the season.  Come on, who needs stats when I can wow you with a ton of opinionated bullshit!  Stats are nice, but sometimes you need to step away from them and just go with gut feelings.  Besides, if you wanted an accurate examination of baseball you’d be reading Rob Neyer right now, not hanging out in a blog reading the ramblings of a Rhody Red Sox fan!  Taking everything I’ve said into account, it’s still early in August and there’s a lot of baseball left to be played.  A ton of crazy stuff can happen between now and the end of the season, so don’t expect my prediction to be anywhere close to the eventual reality.  When the beginning of September rolls around I’ll rehash this post with updates to see how well I’ve forecasted the season.  Maybe I’m a better handicapper than I think!  Update: I finished this post just as last night’s Sox game ended.  The bats finally woke up after the 4th inning and the Sox rolled to an 8-4 win.  I started to feel déjà vu after the Sox were up 3-1 and then promptly gave 2 back to Tampa Bay, but the bottom of the order came up big and put the game out of reach.  My prediction is on target after one game, hellz yeah!  Let’s go out on a positive note by looking at one of the most uplifting news pieces from the Boston media in the past week:   One Detroit player approached a member of the Boston media over the weekend and asked him to shake Jason Varitek's hand for him. When asked why, the player responded: ``For punching that (multiple-expletive) A-Rod! That must have felt good. I've wanted to do that for a long time.''   Any opinions, grievances, hate mail, insults, love letters, or other feelings about this post?  Was it too long, am I a stupid bastard, do I not know what I’m talking about?  If anyone is out there, email me about these or any other topics.  I’d love to hear if people are reading our blog and what you think of it.  I can be reached at cp_tdi@yahoo.com.  We’re at a week and a half and counting with no emails…

       If you have been reading every post this week you can see that our brethren of contributors have already touched upon recent Red Sox news. I am not going to go there since it is Friday and all is almost right with the world, since the weekend is only a few hours away. If you’re one of the lucky few who work in RI you have Monday off (stupid APC).  Let me introduce myself. I am jags78, the Pit Boss of the esteemed Ducks Casino. Ducks is only open to a select few clientele but they are a bunch of lowlife gamblers that like to just throw their money away. Ducks doesn't have much to offer but there are grandiose plans to upgrade to bigger and better things (can you say stripper pole?). Currently the gaming floor is operating with two tables games, Craps and Blackjack, both handcrafted by yours truly. The Blackjack table has been sharing double duty as it also hosts the poker games; right now, obviously, the game is Texas Hold'em. In the expansion plans there are allocations for numerous TV's to watch all the Sox action, a bigger, better poker table, complete with cup and chip holders, jukebox and maybe a slot machine. Only time will tell, well, that and also how much coin the gamblers toss away. Here is a list of things I learned this week:    I suck at golf.    We played a best ball tournament last weekend, me and my gang of intoxicated golfers, managed to come in second too last. It was best ball, but we actually don't know what our final score was, too drunk to add it up or remember, but we know it was better than +11 because we didn't come in dead last.    Margarita's and cigars are a great combination, especially at 9:00 in the morning.     This little tid bit of information was discovered during the above golf tournament. It probably didn't help our score.    McD's got rid of the two cheeseburger value meal. However I have been told this is old news.    I have been told this is old news. It was the best deal in the history of deals! For $2 you could get 2 burgers, a drink and fries. Enough said.    Playing 10 cent Craps you can still lose a good chunk of change.    During the last open night at Ducks we had the biggest gathering of gamblers yet. About 8 people were crowded around the Craps table. I was the box man at this point and was getting taken home like a $1 hooker. Point after point after point was being hit. Hard ways, come bets, numbers, field, no one was crapping out. I mean everyone was just winning on everything, come out rolls 7, 11, 7, 7...they couldn't lose. Normally a person is the box man for about 20 minutes. I was up there for an hour and a half! In 10 cent craps I gave out $22.    Our softball team can win.     See  urlLink What the frik do I say?      Well that's it for now and until next week, happy drinking. Since that was kept short and sweet how about a Haiku for Friday   No More Nomar now Mientkiewicz and Cabrera Swing slide dive hit win!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows by now, the  urlLink Boston Red Sox  traded  urlLink Nomar Garciaparra  and Single A outfield prospect  urlLink Matt Murton  to the  urlLink Chicago Cubs  and got  urlLink Orlando Cabrera  and  urlLink Doug Mientkiewicz  in return from the  urlLink Montreal Expos  and  urlLink Minnesota Twins , respectively. My esteemed colleague,  urlLink TDI , has already examined  urlLink the impact that Mientkiewicz will have on the Red Sox , and today I’ll look at how Cabrera will affect the team.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orlando Cabrera is in his eighth year in the major leagues, having previously spent his entire career with the Montreal Expos. From 1997 through 2002, he hit .262 and got on base at a .308 clip. Not exactly awe-inspiring numbers. Then in 2003, he decided to have his career year. He hit .297 and had an on base percentage of .347, the highest of his career by 23 points. He also set career highs in home runs (17), walks (52), hits (186), doubles (47), slugging percentage (.460), and OPS (.807). Not a bad year by any standards.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his career year, Cabrera has simply been awful this year (killing my fantasy teams in the process). He’s hitting .241 with an OBP of .294. He’s hitting 1 HR every 79.8 at bats, compared to 1 HR every 46 ABs during the rest of his career. His slugging percentage is all of .336, for an OPS of .630. It’s not as bad as Pokey Reese, but still pretty terrible.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what’s wrong with Cabrera? He’s coming off a career year, yet he’s well below his career averages. Lots of theories abound: He’s trying too hard to impress people in his contract year; he’s trying too hard to make up for the loss of  urlLink Vladimir Guerrero ; playing in Montreal just isn’t fun anymore.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any or all of these theories could be true. But the fact remains that Cabrera’s hitting ability is probably closer to his career averages of .266/.315/.406 (AVG/OBP/SLG) than he is to his career year of .297/.347/.460. His strikeout and walk totals this year (29 BB/33 K) have been very similar to the ones he’s posted in the past, so his numbers for this year should progress towards his career averages.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s take a quick look at the main player the Red Sox gave up in this trade,  urlLink Nomar Garciaparra . Everyone knows he’s been one of the best shortstops in the game since he made his debut in 1996. In each of the (6) full seasons he’s played, he never hit lower than .301/.342/.524. If he keeps this up, he’ll easily be  urlLink Hall of Fame  material.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why did the Red Sox make this trade? On the surface, it looks like they traded a potential future Hall of Famer for two guys hitting in the .240’s. But a trade like this always goes deeper than what’s on the surface.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theo Epstein stated the primary reason they made this trade was to prevent  urlLink a flaw from turning into a fatal one , that flaw being defensive inefficiencies. After making this trade (and once  urlLink Pokey Reese  comes back from the DL), the Red Sox will be able to put three Gold Glovers in the infield at once. While Nomar’s defense is serviceable, his range has been seriously affected from the Achilles’ injury he suffered in Spring Training. Cabrera should be a very nice upgrade defensively. Add to that Mientkiewicz playing at first over  urlLink Kevin Millar , and the infield defense has been upgraded tremendously through this trade.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one more aspect of this trade. Nomar was miserable in Boston, and it was one of the worst kept secrets in the town. The almost-trade for  urlLink Alex Rodriguez  affected Nomar so adversely that he just crawled up into his own shell and wouldn’t let anyone on the team in. There have been various reports that Nomar didn’t have many good friends on the team (once  urlLink Lou Merloni  left for the  urlLink Cleveland Indians ), and that he would spend most of his time  urlLink staring blankly into his locker  or talking quietly on his cell phone. He also reportedly told the training staff that he would probably have to miss most of August to rest up and be able to play in September. According to one source,  urlLink Nomar’s agent had to talk him out of demanding a trade .  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epstein saw these events as an opportunity to make a move. He had a fantastic shortstop who was unhappy, and was considering shutting it down for half of the remaining games. He also had a porous defense, which was starting to cost the team games. In completing the  urlLink four-team mega-deal , Epstein solved both the public problem (poor defense), and the private problem (possible “cancer” in the clubhouse). Winning is always the best way to make sure your team has good chemistry, but Nomar was becoming a distraction to everyone on the team. When one of your best players is allegedly sitting out games because he’s “hurt”, that doesn’t send a good signal to the rest of the team.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what does the future hold for the Orlando Cabrera Red Sox? They’ll definitely miss Nomar’s bat. However, during the Great Popup Streak of September and October 2003, the Red Sox managed to score plenty of runs, so this may be a moot point. Keep in mind that Nomar had only played in 38 (out of a possible 101) games this season, and the Red Sox were still second in the league in scoring (trailing only the Indians). Cabrera is a more sure handed defender, and with Mientkiewicz at first base, there should be more putouts and less errors and unearned runs. If Cabrera can enjoy even part of the success that he had last year offensively, there will only be a slight decrease, if any, in the amount of runs scored, and the Red Sox should be able to win more than half their remaining games. It won’t be enough to catch the  urlLink New York Yankees , but it should be enough to win the Wild Card.

      An era of Red Sox baseball ended this past weekend with the trade of Nomar Garciaparra to the Cubs. Many people feel that the Sox gave up too much to get rid of him, while others think that this is just a reflection of what a poor trade market there was for a disgruntled and injured shortstop. Plenty of other opinions and insults have been flying since this bold move, but the fact of the matter is that the trade has been made and we can only move forward from here. When it comes to the Red Sox I’m a “glass is half full” kind of guy. I trust that this ownership group, and especially our GM, is only trying to make the best moves for this team in the short and long term. With that in mind, we here at Down By One figured we should take a look at the two players the Sox ended up with after trading away Nomar and a top OF prospect, Matt Murton. A heated round of rock/paper/scissors took place between Tim and I, and sadly I was the loser…which obviously means I have to analyze everyone’s spelling bee nightmare, Doug Mientkiewicz.  Doug MeatSandwich (as he will be known from now on here at Down By One) came to the Sox from the Minnesota Twins. He seemed to be the odd man out with the Twins wanting to get some playing time for Justin Morneau. MeatSandwich is 30 years old with decent numbers, but Morneau is considered to be one of the best prospects in their system and he has already maxed out his potential at AAA. As we hear so much lately, “baseball is a business” so it made sense for the Twins to try to move MeatSandwich by the trading deadline. There were lots of rumors as to where his destination was going to be, and as luck would have it he has ended up on the Red Sox.  After this trade was announced, GM Theo Epstein let the Nation know that this move was made to improve the atrocious Red Sox defense for the stretch run. If defense is what they were looking for, then MeatSandwich seems to be the perfect fit. I don’t know about you, but the trio of Ortiz/Millar/McCarty doesn’t really instill a ton of confidence when they put on a first baseman’s mitt. McCarty is the best of the bunch, but his bat prevents him from being in the lineup on an extended basis. MeatSandwich is considered by many scouts to be one of the best defensive first baseman in the league. He won the AL Gold Glove in 2001 and should have probably won a few more along the way. In terms of pure defense, he is a huge upgrade over the current players manning first. We won’t get into all the fancy defensive stats that they’ve got nowadays, but believe me: he’s good.  Defense is nice, but people like the long ball so it’s time to look at his offensive contributions. MeatSandwich’s stats before this season (around 4 full seasons of games) shows that he is averaging:   69 runs, 11 HRs, 69 RBI with a .279 avg, .371 obp, .415 slg  Historically he has been a mediocre offensive player. His HRs and RBIs are low for the average AL first baseman, but he hits for a decent average and with above average on-base and slugging percentages. I’m not sure where he normally hit in the Twins lineup, but this could explain his low RBI total. This year MeatSandwich is down from his career averages (.250/.342/.365) but his doubles, HRs, walks, and strikeouts look to be on track. The problem seems to be that he’s posting these numbers in more at-bats than in the past. To put it into perspective, he only needed to get one more hit per ten games he’s played to put him up around his career numbers. What we’re getting is a guy who gets on base at a good rate and is hitting a lot of doubles. For a team like the Sox who sit and wait for the long ball, a guy who regularly drives a shot down the line or into the gaps would seem to be a welcome addition.  So far we see a player with fantastic defense and decent offense. The last angle to look at is MeatSandwich’s contract. One of the most important factors is that the amount of money he’s paid hopefully matches up well with the type of player he is. Here’s how it looks:   2004 - $2.8 million 2005 - $3.75 million 2006 - $3.75 million option ($450,000 buyout)   For the pro-rated portion of $2.8 million that the Red Sox have to pay this year for MeatSandwich, they’ve got themselves a fairly good deal. He can play first base regularly, turn in the stellar defense expected of him, and help out with the bat every now and then. This will keep David Ortiz off of first base and in the DH spot where he belongs. This also has the added benefit of keeping one-dimensional guys like McCarty and Millar on the bench. In the short term, this is a smart move with the immediate goal being to shore up the team’s biggest weakness, defense, in an attempt to win the World Series.  For the future, I feel that this was a pretty good move as well. $3.75 million is a pretty reasonable number for a player with MeatSandwich’s skills. This is especially true when you think about the fact that he plays first base, which is notoriously a position where one-dimensional players get monster contracts (see Giambi, Jason). It also gives us the luxury of knowing that the Sox are already guaranteed to have a solid defender at first for next season. Finally, even if he turns out to be a complete dud he’s only on the books for a total of $4.2 million, and that’s much less money than what the Sox wasted on pieces of crap like Blowse Offerman and Darren Oliver. From what I see, this looks like the Sox are finally breaking their trend of getting guys to play first who are all bat and no glove! Was it worth it to get him as half of the Sox return on the Nomar trade? I’m not sure, but I’ve got 86 reasons that makes me hope it was…  If anyone is out there reading this, send me an email at  urlLink cp_tdi@yahoo.com  to let me know what you think!

      Let’s face it: Red Sox fans have problems. We’re competitive on a regular basis, yet we never seem to be happy. Maybe it’s the championship drought (it’s been…awhile). Maybe because it has been 18 years since Fenway hosted a World Series game. Maybe it’s because for all the talk and obsessing we do about this team, nothing seems to change. I think the new saying should be “Death, Taxes, and the American League East”. In April we were on top of the world, in August we’re in second place behind the Yankees. Same old, same old. Well, on Saturday something changed. One of the most popular athletes in the history of Boston sports removed his uniform before the game started, and headed to Chicago.  Love him, like him, or angry with him (but only since September), Nomar Garciaparra was Boston’s favorite son with the funny name. Oh, and he was a pretty good hitter. In each of his 6 full seasons he hit 21 or more home runs, hitting 27 or more in 5 of them. He never hit below .300. His career batting average is .323. His career on base percentage, .370. His career slugging, .555. He was in the top 9 for MVP voting 5 times.  “He never hit in the playoffs!” Wrong. In 1998, he hit .333 in 4 games and had 11 RBI’s. In 1999 he batted over .400 in both the ALDS and ALCS. In 2003, .300 against Oakland, .243 against the Yankees. Not exactly Mr. October last year, but even Reggie had a bad series or two.  So why is he gone? The popular theory is money. He turned down a 4 year, $60 million contract at the beginning of 2003. In retrospect, a terrible move on his part, and I’m sure it had a great deal to do with his agent. Let’s compare what Nomar made over his career, compared to his counterpart Derek Jeter.  Nomar: 1996 - $109,000 1997 - $150,000 1998 - $1,075,000 1999 - $1,400,000 2000 - $3,700,000 2001 - $7,250,000 2002 - $9,000,000 2003 - $11,000,000  Here is what Jeter made during the same years: 1996 - $130,000 1997 - $550,000 1998 -$750,000 1999 - $5,000,000 2000 - $10,000,000 2001 - $12,600,000 2002 - $14,600,000 2003 - $15,600,000  Oh, and before you start with all the “Mr. November” crap, the Yankees have not won a World Series since Tino Martinez and Paul O’Neil skipped town.  Nomar is a proud person and probably felt he deserved to be paid what Jeter was making. Is being proud a flaw? It does not seem to be when we talk about Pedro.  I don’t think money was the real issue. It was leadership. That is what management wanted him to provide, and that is what he could not. Nomar is a private person, and that’s not something you can change. He was a leader on the field. He played hard and to the best of his ability at all times. He was a leader in the community. However, that was never good enough. When he injured his wrist in 2001, the media acted as if he did it on purpose, much like they did when he hurt his heel in spring training. Conspiracy theorist devised scenarios where Nomar was faking in order to bring the Red Sox to their knees and give him a larger contract offer. I can see it now….Nomar, sitting at home with Mia, twirling his mustache as he thinks up a plan to tie Manny to some railroad tracks. Let me explain something to you folks. To become a professional athlete you need to be driven. And it’s something the majority of us can’t understand. Playing baseball is in Nomar’s blood and that is the reason he made it to the big leagues. It is the reason he tirelessly conditions himself each winter. And, it’s the reason New England chanted his name.  Then, while on his honeymoon, he finds out they are trying to trade him. Clubhouse leader Kevn Millar goes on SportsCenter and tells the world he would rather have AROD. I think your feelings may have been a little hurt, too.  On to the future. For Nomar, we got a shortstop with a back problem, a career .269 batting average, and a free agent to be. We also got another 1st baseman, who has a .279 career batting average. Rather odd when you recall that Theo said he was looking for pitching and a right fielder. You think they will issue one of these guys #5?  The defense is better, which, according to Theo, will help Derek Lowe. That is great, until you realize that Lowe will be gone after this year. I guess what it all boils down to is that Nomar was not going to re-sign, and it’s better to get something then to let him walk and get nothing. When you think of it, though, it was really more then money. It was respect and understanding. Every time Manny does something quirky, or Pedro starts complaining, we all say “Just shut up and play baseball”. Well, that is all Nomar ever wanted to do. And that is what this really all came down to.
