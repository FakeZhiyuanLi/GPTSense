       A week ago my little girl started taking swim lessons. Many a time up until a week ago my daughter has been taken into the pool and splashed around&nbsp;to test the water (no pun intended). Yet, my darling girl had bigger plans for the water. She wants to learn how to surf - mind you that she is only 7 years old, but she wants to surf when she is older (along with skateboarding, snowboarding and bungee jumping). There are a few hesitations that I have in regards to her learning to surf, some of which include the fact that I would like to think I haven't been given an angel from heaven only to use her as shark food. However, to stave off this constant appeal for surfing and to appease her majesty, I promised her swimming lessons. The bargain I made with her was that she couldn't set foot (or belly) on a surfboard until she learned how to swim so good she could save a drowning person. So with much joy and delight she started her official swimming lessons. Her quick adaptation to learning strokes and how to float on her back, not to mention diving for rings at the bottom of the pool, completely floored me. Swimming is in her blood as nearly everyone in her biological family has swum either recreationally or competitively. Personally I could never master the backstroke or even swimming in a straight line for some perplexing reason, so I was delegated by my coaches to the diving pool. Knowing this, though, did not prepare me for the suprise I encountered today.   As her lesson was dwindling down to the last five minutes, her coach told her that they were going to walk down to the diving pool and practice jumping off the short diving board. As my girl was rounding the pool to get to the diving boards, she glanced up at the high platform board and said, "I think it would be more fun to jump off that one." Very badly did I want to believe that I had water in my ears and was hearing things. Yet, I just watched in awe as her coach said "Okay - go for it" and my fearless angel climbed steadily to the top of the platform. She strolled right out to the edge, curled her toes over the edge like an old pro, took one look at me, gave the old thubs up sign, and bombs away!!! If there was anyone standing next to me they must have seen my jaw drop. Almost immediately she surfaced, treaded the water so calmly and swam off to the side with a "I'm going to do that again okay?" The kid floors me. She kept looking over at me and my grin must have been pasted to each of my ears, while my thumbs were frozen up.   Later in the evening as I was helping her dry off from the shower, she leaned in towards me with her big blue eyes all round and twinkling and she whispered to me, "Mom, I think God forgot one ingredient when he made me." My heart laughed as it always does when my daughter engages me in one of these enlightening conversations. "Really Sweetness? What was the missing ingredient?" She beamed back at me with rosy cheeks, "Fear - he just didn't give me any at all.... I haven't got any in me anywhere. Sometimes I'm not sure about things, but I'm never afraid." While fear is not something I have ever displayed in front of my daughter, I know its not a "missing ingredient" in me.&nbsp; In her little life though, my daughter has endured many frightening things, from being born with a hole in one lung and the other collapsed, to losing family members and knowing her favorite Uncle is in the middle of the Iraq war - and these are just a few. She truly doesn't have a concept of fear - she doesn't know how to be afraid and she doesn't seem to know why a person should be afraid.&nbsp; So often I hear people using the phrase "No fear" or I see the seemingly trendy bumperstickers and logos. When I do observe these things, I can't help but wonder if any of those people truly are missing that ingredient or if they are simply trying to convince themselves they are brave. Only time will tell if its harmless to lack that component of human nature that is fear, but meanwhile I'll stock up on the inspiration granted by witnessing this&nbsp;little&nbsp;Bundle of Brave.&nbsp;

      Its summer here in gold old California and the SUV drivers of the Golden State are loading up their camping gear and heading out.&nbsp; Like them, my vacation plans have been made. For 8 blissful days I will be camped out at a beach and, although camping trips have been routine for me over the past seven years, I&nbsp; must admit that I'm tired of overstuffing my little Honda Civic with gear and tying crap down on the roof rack as well. My vacation destination is less than an hour away and yet because my camping compadre is a 7 year old princess I have to pack everything (including the portable kitchen sink). My car has taken a fierce beating because of this. It has gotten to the point now that when our little trips end, I only unpack the tent, air mattress, and porta-potty (yes, her majesty requires a portapotty!). The rest of the goods just stay in the car because of the weekend day trips and evening jaunts to the lake in the hills behind our home. My theory is then that because I have all this stuff in my car, I should allow myself the luxury of a new car. Right? Well......sorry folks but I am going to subject you to my torturous list of pros and cons. Let this be your insight to my amazingly indecisive nature!   First of all let's tackle this princess issue. When I was a kid we were allowed to pack one bag for a camping trips. Being the youngest of five kids I had it pretty good because what ever I didn't have room for, one of the other kids was sure to bring along anyways. My daughter may not have that luxury because I'm not brave enough to have more kids (what if they are ALL like her?!!) but I think she needs to have a couple of boundaries here. One of those boundaries should be the portapotty. Sooner or later the kid has got to realize that germs are germs are germs!!! They are on this toilet or that toilet - they are everywhere. The solution to germs are not avoidint public restrooms but SOAP AND WATER (which coincidentally are much easier to pack than porta potties). Flushing the portapotty out of the car shouldn't be such a terriffic battle (no pun intended!). Than there is the air mattress - I mean COME ON!!! How many kids had this luxury on camping trips??!!!! My parents idea of a air mattress was the patch of ground with the most pine needles - as it should be. Ixnay on the mattressay!!! Than there are the beach toys - granted they ARE a necessity - but the quantity???!!! Lets have one bucket, one shovel and one sifter - and that will suffice. Perhaps I can convince my darling girl to leave the rest of the toys in the store for the OTHER kids!!! Yes, my little girl is going to have to get the tough love session on this next camping trip.... perhaps I'll let her know that either the stuff goes or she goes???!!!!! In all fairness though, I must blame this spoiled nature of her on her grandparents - and trust me, I have every right to lay blame there because they happily accept it!   Next there is the actual mechanics of the car. This is a 10 year old car, that has never missed a major or minor service. The engine is in extremely good condition (it is spared the child's havoc) and give me no cause for worry. With nearly 145,000 miles on it, I'm told by fellow members of the "Civic Nation" that I can easily get another 100K out of&nbsp;it. The mileage I get out of The Trusty Turtle (this name is due more to the drivers aversion to speeding tickets than the actual car) is far better I know than the mileage I could get out of any new car with more cargo space. The Subaru Forrester has killer cargo space but is a gashog. My wallet doesn't like gashogs and neither does my affection for the environment.   Then there is the money. Money's funny honey. The trick here is that I own The Trusty Turtle. Own as in paid for, pink slip in my name, my first constructive financial commitment! Monthly car payments are something I haven't dealt with in two years and its not something I'm looking forward to ever again! Naturally I don't miss the insurance payments either because I've found that as the OWNER of my car, I can afford full coverage at the same rate as an UNOWNED car's liability only rate. You can't go wrong with that! Seeing as I live in California I would also have to contend with the OUTRAGEOUS registration fees - I'm only paying 45 dollars a year to register the Trusty Turtle and I can't walk away from the diabolical joy I get out of listening to people moan and groan about how much they pay to register their  new  cars.   Those are all pretty decent  pro's  right? Alas, here are my  cons.  They are childish at best, so be aware that I am fully aware of that! First off there is the color. You would think my Trusty Turtle is green or some olive shade, yes? Think again.... its a dull blah red. Not my favorite color. The rear bumper is actually maroon thanks to some crazy lady who tapped my bumer two months into my possession of the car&nbsp;and no body shop has ever matched my flat dull red color. You see, when I bought this car I was driving a practically home made VW bug and it wasn't exactly baby proof - so because I was in a bit of a bind and too stupid to know better I bought the first slightly used Civic I came across - which turned out to be my Trusty Turtle. When I signed the papers I knew I hated the color but I was young and had the grand illusion of painting it (why doesn't anyone ever tell you how much that kind of project costs?). So yes its a nasty color and I hate it - I've hated the color for seven years.  Then there is the dated accessories. While I've improved the stereo system as best I could (I must have my music you know) there was nothing that could be done about the lack of power anything. My idea of power windows came about when my daughter graduated from her car seat - since then power windows is "Sweetie could you roll 'em down" or "Brr... roll em up!" Likewise with the door locks although we are now in the "If they want it that bad they can have it" frame of mind! Air conditioning is a dream of ours...... too frice down the highway in the summer with the windows rolled up so we could actually HEAR the music we are listening too!!!To think we might actually arrive somewhere with our hairdo's intact! Its a princess's dream! Yes, I would love to have a car that had these amenities.   So now I have to admit that sinking myself into a financial cesspool just to have a pretty colored car and power everything doesn't seem really doable. In today's day and age when a girl is living paycheck to paycheck and gas prices are displaying an extreme aversion to gravity - it just doesn't seem logical to bind myself up in those money woes. So instead we will pocket that money we don't spend on a new car. We will polish up the dull red paint, tighten down the old roof rack, and overstuff our trunk with our necessities. The Trusty Turtle has been good to us.&nbsp; The bottom line is that it gets us where we need to go - we just might have to take a little less of us there!   Thanks for reading! Pack wisely and drive safe!!!

      Today is the first day of the rest of my life. That is probably the CHEESIEST thing I have ever heard...... but on a day like today I am going to take comfort in that cheese.....and here is the "whine" that I will have with it.&nbsp;My life is a harried, confused, mangle of all things odd and warped&nbsp;at best. Writing always frees my mind but lately all the things I've written have been overflowing with gloom and doom. That is not who I am, not who I want to be, and certainly not who I am going to allow myself to be. So rather than elaborate on all the things that have gone wrong in my world or all the things that bring me down, I am determined to focus on all the things that go right and bring me joy.&nbsp; Shakespeare wrote in The Winter's Tale, "What's gone and what's past help should be past grief." With that said, I must acknowledge one thing and that is that I am wrong to think so darkly of my life, for there is pain worse than mine in this world. My matters are trivial compared to those of orphaned children, weary soldiers, prisoners and endangered souls among many other things. So, not only for the sake of my sanity, but also with the hope that my writings might inspire some joy or peace in another I am going to set myself the lofty goal of bearing good news and bringing a little joy to this world. But now I must go to sleep (not perchance to dream though). Instead I fear I might have nightmares about cheezy quotes and poisonous wine.

      The world is at my fingertips My dreams are spinning around the globe Where is my freedom from familiarity And the courage to make these dreams my own? One day I'll walk away from here To where nobody knows my name Fascination will conquer all fear Independence the only rule of the game To see this world with my own eyes And decide for myself what beauty is This is just one of the dreams of my life Someday to this dream - only life will I give.

      I want to survive I want to be strong I want to be at peace To sing a happy song Let there be no more tears For this tortured soul No more pain No more cold I will look at you I will not feel pain I will feel warm  After all this rain I've learned so much From all that we had That life's not long enough To walk around mad Forgive you I will But I'll never forget The good is still there  There will be more yet I don't want to spend The rest of my years &nbsp;In pain and misery Every day filled with tears I want to smile To take in the world And be once more That fun loving girl I want to learn From our mistakes I want to move on Abandon this ache Will we call truce Will we silence the shouts? Can we survive  All of these doubts Are we strong enough To smile when we meet Lets not be strangers When we pass on the street You have your life I am making mine Can we share them a little For the rest of time? We have shared too much  To just walk away Surely those years of friendship Were not all meant for waste Lets work on good times Do away with the bad Lets work on smiles And kill all the sad I want to survive I want to be strong I want to have the friend That I've had all along. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      She stands in dawn's early light With her face turned to the wind The breeze plays with her hair As she listens to the ocean's din Where has she come from? A land of brokend hearts Where is she heading? A land where love will not depart Her young heart has seen Its share of troubled times Her hope refuses to fall though On over every mountain she climbs So here's a wish of luck To the lady in the wind May she find her happiness May her heart never break again.

      Please give me your hand I really need a friend Please won't you tell me That this war will soon end I've been standing here so long Fighting these battles all alone Please take my hand Tell me the fight is done Its awful to be a soldier Defending a hopeless cause Knowing you'll never win That your efforts are all for naught I need the patience of a saint And the warmth of a good friend I need the sweet release That only the kindest fate would send.

      I don't know you anymore &nbsp;You aren't who you used to be The friend I had in you Is now a confusing mystery You act like I'm a stranger Don't give me the time of day All this from the person For whom I gave my dreams away We use to have something And now you disagree What we had was very special And you are losing it now with me I don't want to know you anymore Don't want to see your face Don't want to hear your voice  Don't want hear your lies Or see myself be replaced Too see you treat me like this After all the things we faced Have you served me any kind of good? You broke my heart and all my dreams You took my future and our plans To leave me here with soundless screams You don't deserve my thoughts The good ones or the bad You don't deserve my memories You didn't deserve anything we had I don't know what it is That you want from me The standard "just friends" Isn't in my therapy You took my sense of trust You took my sense of self You don't understand that you've given me This most unbearable version of hell So I raise your child now As you live a carefree life My life is forever changed You know nothing of my strife Ignorance is yours now Yet I've learned so many things That trust is a false notion Along with all the pain it brings So go live your ignorant life But stay away from me You have no right to us now Consider yourself freed We are making a new life You are not allowed in For the pain that you have brought us Will be your damning sin I will close this door I will walk away I will not know you anymore Only love you till my dying day

      Anger where love used to be Confusion and frustration swallowing me Forgiveness once came without thinking twice But now doubt prevails in my life Help me oh help me somebody please Take my hand and guide me up from my knees It is impossible to cry anymore I&nbsp;have no tears left and my voice is gone hoarse This darkness surrounds where beauty once was The numbness within allows for no love Too exhausted to lay blame Too frightened to trust Although I want to live a memory Live in the future I must Summon the courage  Every day Force my eyes open Find a way If my life were my own  It just wouldn't be But I share it with one Who depends solely&nbsp;on me What good am I though In this weak shell With a hardened heart And living in hell How do I dry her tears If I can't dry my own How do I stand up When I've never been so alone Time will tell What the future may be Please no more hell No more suffering Make them leave me alone Make them leave me in peace Give me some quiet  Give me release I will take my strength  From the earth's endless power From every wave and every storm Every tree every flower Cruelty will be banished From my life forevermore If that means I live alone Than as such I walk through every door I will not think anymore  Of the promises broken Just live and learn from  What experience has spoken. &nbsp;

      My heart saw something today That my mind didn't want it to see My heart saw the cold truth And it shattered and screamed For so many years my heart Has been sheltered from this truth Today my mind dropped its guard And reality came into view Have I been living my life in a fog -  In this love blinded haze? Is this truth going to kill me Or make me strong for future days? It is so hard to think of the future When I'm now doubting my past Was all that love in my head? Did I believe that would last? So here is a heart so shattered With damage beyond belief Can it ever be repaired Or is it destined to live in grief? How can it be - that I believed this lie? How ignorant is my heart What a fool I have been Perhaps even from the start? So now this is over But will my heart survive Will I ever be able to breathe again Without thinking my life is a lie? Find a new reason is all I can do Find some kind of reason to live without you.

      Excuse me but sir Have you seen my heart around I've looked everywhere But it just can't be found Last time I had it I was looking at you I think I lost it when you bid me adieu I've always kept it&nbsp;under lock and key But the first time I met you somehow it got free It might have been the twinkle in your eyes Or maybe the moon shining in the sky Its not that I mind my heart being gone I was just wondering how its getting along? When it comes to leaving my heart's pretty new I hope it doesn't come back broken in two If you see my heart feel free to pick it up But please be gentle its overflowing with love And I hope that you won't treat it too bad Just remember please its the only heart that I have.

      She has always been alone Wanting love and nothing more Now she is free At last her soul will soar The pain of this world Will hurt her never again Her face wear a calm smile For her pain is at an end In this life there were three things That without fail made her smile A man, a piano and the unconditional Love of a beautiful child But they are all gone They have left her alone A cold heart is now her home Surrounded with walls of stone

      I gave you my love All that I had What were you thinking To treat it so bad You have shattered my heart One too many times Now I have to build a wall Around this tattered heart of mine It was broken when you found it You healed it so well But once it was healed You threw it to hell I never thought This could happen again To feel so alone And searching for the end Every where I look  I see pain and misery Where is the happiness  That you gave to me Now my soul is so tired Of being pained by love My tears are all hollow I give up I've had enough I don't know why love Is all that some seek To me it is only pain And it has made me so weak I know that I can't Stop loving you But how do I survive  The hell I'm going through Every time I see you I see all that we had Now you throw that away  Like it was something so bad Well it wasn't you know As bad as you thought I know you were happy Whether you like that or not So take my love with you It is a bleeding mess Finish your destruction For now my heart's useless I have a thousand memories Playing a picture show in my head It is driving me crazy  Wanting this love that is dead Take it all away and leave me alone It is how I should be With a heart of stone.

      If you want to leave I won't make you stay But please don't let me Be why you walk away I know our lives have been Tangled beyond belief But if we only try again We might find some relief You are my best friend Even though you shut me out But I am willing to forgo What you ask me to do without Can't you see the sacrifices The ones I make without end How hard I am trying To keep us as friends I live every day  With what we had in our past I try to set that aside So that our friendship can last I know that I am not  As strong as I should be But is it only the failures I make that you see? Do you see how far I've come in such short time Do you see how I'm sorting The pain in my mind? I am not a quick learner But then who is with love? We all make mistakes That is no reason to give up I want us to work However we can I believe in us both  And I believe in this plan &nbsp;

      He left me years ago  But every day he says goodbye  And the words echo on  In this shattered heart of mine  The tears keep falling  Day after day  The pain in my heart  Doesn't go away  Did I do something wrong?  Why did our love end?  I ask these questions  Time and again  The answer never arrives  It will remain a mystery  And the pain that I feel  Lets the confusion swallow me  "You'll meet someone else"  That's what they all sayDon't they know that with him  I was happy that way  I don't want someone else  I want to ease this pain  Even if that means  That all my feelings go away  I have the memories  But they are not enough  My heart needs more  &nbsp;My heart needs love

       Four walls surrounded me   I was searching for a door   I'd been there forever   I'd be there forevermore   I had a great big window   I could see the world outside   Every time I looked through it   My heart would start to cry   On the other side of the window   There was a woman walking by   She held a baby in her arms   And had a loving man at her side   On my side of the window   The tears would fall like rain   For all my life I'd only held   Misery and pain   Within these walls of misery   True love had never lived   A happy home and family   Were just a dreamer's wish   With the lightness of a feather   One day a kiss was blown   It turned the window to a mirror   Knocked down the walls of stone   Four walls surround me   Please don't open the door   I've been here forever   I want to stay forevermore

      After a week of sluggish days at work that seemed completely unproductive and evenings of standing perfectly still while the drama and chaos of my friends’ lives swirled around me, I needed a reprieve from the insanity. So, I took myself down to the Camera Cinema on Friday night and gave myself a perfectly nice treat – I saw Garden State. If you are in your mid twenties and have weeks like the one I described, please go see this film. It is one of those grand little films that you can identify with. The perfect thing about it is the fact that all the supporting characters are people you probably know in your own lives – the slacker friends from high school who still live at home and have high-school jobs, the oblivious parents who are convinced you are inherently evil, the well meaning friends who want to do right by the world but just never seem to pull that off so well…. The list goes on. Add to that the stellar performance by Zach Braff (we knew he was good in Scrubs… but now we see even MORE potential), the sweetly inspirational performance by Natalie Portman, and last but most definitely NOT least – the soundtrack. The soundtrack is almost the beacon of this film – so not only can Zach Braff act, direct and produce – he also has a killer knack for compiling music! So if you are twenty something and idling on your mom’s couch – go see this movie and know that there is pain worse than yours in this world. We are all muddling through this same muck together so hang in there and enjoy the little smiles in life like this movie.

      Online Bill Pay is the work of the devil. All day long yesterday I had plenty of opportunities to go online and pay my bills.  It is such an incredibly easy task - just like the commercials!!! With a few clicks of a button my debtors are pacified for a few short weeks.  The diabolical thing about online bill pay is that because of its simplicity it tends to be one of those things you always find yourself saying you can "do later because it won't take so long." Hah!!!! That's the devil's work right there!!!  Naturally, I fell for that demonic scheme over the past week. Knowing that due dates loomed and days seemed to fly, I kept rescheduling my "pay bills" task day after day until finally last night I decided the time had come to face my financial fears and pay my bills online.  After I sorted my stack of bills, determining which ones had due dates that were iminent and which ones were still safely within a 5-7 business day mailing time-frame, I powered up the good old notebook.  However, due to my wireless network system and the fact that someone at PacBell dropped a ball, my wireless network was DOWN!!! Aaaahhhh!!! The horror!!!! There was no easy way then to pay my bills!!!!! So there I sat, bills in one hand, fistfuls of hair in the other...... and I swear my trusty old checkbook was sitting there on the desk mocking me!!! So if there are any collection agencies out there with my name on their "Past Due" lists - the check is in the mail. And to you evil cretins at PacBell I would very much like to thank you for teaching me such a valuable lesson about procrastinating with wireless technology.

      Being single has been a good way of life for me. The past four years of my life have been spent being single. They have been good years in which I have been laboring away at trying to establish my sense of self. The funny thing about establishing your sense of self is that you never really complete that task. People change so much throughout the journey of a lifetime - only recently did I come to that marvelous realization. You never really stay the same. Your habits change, your beliefs can change, your desires change, probably the only thing about a person that stays constant and true is their blood type. How do you take this knowledge of infinite uncertainty and merge it with anothers? So strongly do I believe that somewhere there has to be the other half of me - but how do I know that the other half of me will want to be merged with my half twenty years from now? Being single is such a happy place without those insecurities and fears - it almost seems a shame to cease existing in such an independent state. Yet somewhere out there the other half is lurking........ so I guess I'd better just soak up all this freedom and enjoy my current state of me while it lasts. Don't misunderstand - I look forward to the inevitable relationship and all the uncertainty it will bring, however, I know this independence will be missed. Unless..... the other half of me is so incredibly good at being the other half of me that all thoughts of independence are swept away. So here's a wish of good luck then to the other half of me that has to be out there somewhere - God knows you'll have your hands full!!!
