      I'm back again! Since my last post I have ordered Creatures for PlayStation, gone to a few park days, met an old friend, went to music, graduated from latin, bought a book on making video games, beat Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, had a sleepover with Amanda, started watching Yu-Gi-Oh on TV and traded some of my Yu-Gi-Oh trading cards! Not exactly busy though. Oh and I went to a school meeting. TLC is in business! Yay! A new school! Now when the school gives us money, we don't have to only spend it on classes! We can spend it on trips to theme parks and stuff! I wanna go to to Disney's California Adventure! It will be so fun! Well that's it! Bye!

      Sorry! I guess I can only post in the morning about yesterday! Well yesterday I was on the computer and then we did latin and german. After that, we went shopping because we were out of Mountain Dew and while we were waiting for our dad to get the MD we decided to bet 2 cents that if dad got live wire Renee wins and if he gets normal MD, I win. I won. When we got home we each had an MD and after an hour of break we started school again. When it was time for our 30 min break, we cleaned the rabbit cage, fed the rabbits and even gave the rabbits a bath! My rabbit knocked a whole bunch of stuff down! Oh and we also dropped off the big tv to be fixed. I tried to play a game on the internet that Anna told me about but my computer was crashing and I didn't have a certain Java player installed so I tried my dad's computer which had the Java player. When I play it, the screen freezes and the next thing I know, my fish are dead (in the game of course because my fish died a long time ago already)! My dad had just woken up from a nap and he was in a bad mood so he got upset when I told him that there was a problem and he stayed in a bad mood until mom got home from work and sent us to LA Fitness to work out. Oops! Shouldn't have told you that! Well When we finished mom came to pick Renee up from the kid care center so that we could work out more but she was too late unfortunatly. When I got home I had 2 PB&J Sandwitches and watched part of the simple life. We went to bed and Renee was acting up and then I couldn't sleep so I got up and finished my knitting project. That's when I went back to bed and eventually fell asleep. That's just about it.

      I didn't have time yesterday to post what happened so I'm going to just say what I know. It was latin class again. We showed our project and did the same stuff as always. When we were done we went outside and sort of graduated from the first year. When we were done I got back at Iosua (Joshua) by hitting him and then Anna's mom Millie walked by and we called to her. She brought Little Bear her dog and we said hi to him too. We said Valete (Good bye in latin) to every one and then went with Millie and Anna. Before we went to her house we dropped Little Bear off at a grooming place and then we checked out a new gym that had PS2 Offroad Bikes in the kid care center! They were also shooting photos with a model and that's when we left to go to Anna's house. When we got there we played and played and then we left to pick up Little Bear. When we got back we played some more and then I showed Millie my knitting that I brought and then my mom came to pick me up. So while the parents were gabbing as all parents do when coming to pick their kids up, we hid and the place we hid, I shall not mention. Afterwards we played with the beanie boppers that Renee got and then the rest I can't remember. But since the thing that happened today is so great I'll tell you what it was at least. My dad told me that he got an e-mail from Tech Support saying that they got the PS2 and that they are gonna start working on it! Ok I told you everything I could!

      Well today wasn't like normal school days. First I let my dad try and wake me up but I was already awake but I wasn't going to stop him from scratching my back. Eventually I got up and got dressed of course. When it was time for school at 10:30, we did some german and then practiced latin. Since Tuesdays are latin days where we go to our class, we had to do a craft today. We had to make 3 different rooms. A kitchen, a dining room and a bathroom. The bathroom was requested by me. So we went to Value Craft and while we were there I got some more yarn and a really weird set of needles. We got some little things like little bowls, brooms and even some little cups. We also got some real stiff paper stuff and by the time we were done shopping, we had gotten a 4D horse puzzle and went back because they didn't give us the puzzle. When we got home we started making the rooms and we worked on them from noon to 4:00! When we were done, I ate a burrito as if I hadn't eaten for days! I did get some computer time and a chance to call Mary again but Mary wasn't there! I am so tired now! Tommorrow I have latin class and afterwards I'm going to go to my friend Anna's house. I will obviousley have to bring the game I borrowed even though I didn't get to use it once! If I had known that the PS2 wasn't reading PS1 discs earlier, I wouldn't have borrowed it until later! Yeesh! When I get my PS2 back and it's fixed, I'm gonna start doing a monthly check! Nah, make it weekly! Ok, I've had enough excitment for one day!

      Well my sister is back and she hasn't left me alone since. I'm still playing Petz 5 and my little sister was showing me what she bought while playing with her friend and now she is trying to take over the computer and wants to play Petz 5. Since Petz 5 is where you get to take care of virtual petz, they can run away. All the petz are mine and I tried to explain to her that if she plays, my petz will run away. Now she's upset and says that she is going to tell on me but so far, no one has come so nobody cares about what she's complaining about. Now my dad is yelling at the tv. He's watching basketball again. He says that he doesn't want the Lakers to win. Yup, we're big losers. Wait until I tell you what football team we route for! Yes, I mean the Chargers. When Renee (my little sister's name) came home I called my best friend Amanda to see if she could come over next saturday but she was visiting one of her neighbors so I called again later and then she said that it was her birthday on saturday so I called my friend Mary but when her mom picked up, she said that Mary had to call back later and she still hasn't called back! I hope one of my friends get to come over because I haven't had a friend over for so long! Plus, Renee gets to sleepover at Alyra's house(Alyra is the friend that she saw today) on saturday! Well that's all I have to say for today so bye!

      Today is my first day on blogger.com and so far it's great! At 11:05 am my sister left to go to a friends house and since my PS2 is gone to be fixed I was just sitting at the computer playing Petz 5. My mom came home without me knowing she was gone and brought a couple hundred hair bands saying that you can never have too many and some ultra cool sandles for me and because I wasn't wearing shoes when I went outside to feed the rabbits, they are all dirty now! That's the problem with white sandles, they are so pretty for 5 minutes then they are as brown as can be and you want new shoes! I never have a whole lot to say so I might add a part 2 to this entry. See ya soon!
