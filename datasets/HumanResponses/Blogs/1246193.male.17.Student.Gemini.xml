         Brit, Britain, Brittney. I don't know what her real name is. Maybe she should be called Rudolph, I don't know.  She often makes stupid comments about nothing in particular. Gregg found it funny so he wrote some of the things she said down.  Later, Ryan was reading it and she made the comment,"It is so funny you will pee." That is just one example of how very weird she is.  I decided to post some of her sayings, so brace yourself.  The following are quotes from that one girl who I don't know what to call.  ~Gypsies made my lip gloss. ~I smell crutons! ~Pie screams,"Banquet, Banquet, Fun Banjo." ~Bucket Brownies Car-Puddle! ~I thought it was a magic barrier. ~I think God is Jamaican ~My face is going to bunn off. ~Bow-Chica-Buga-Bow-Bow-Bow-Wow ~I am friggin' awesome! ~Boo-Yasimite ~Silly Gum Gunk ~I think I'm a genious. ~You're a bookcase. ~Tumbleweed Laca-Chaca Clothes pin. ~Flowers make Gumby Horny.                                                                                               Here is one of her poems: house-rock-school- grow grass grow! pie-hats-lips-car- grow grass grow! like-butt-turtle- grow grass grow! pass-clock-spork- I hate potatoes.                                                                                             And here are two names you may get called in her presence: Homeskillet Queer-tart  WOW, she is a very weird person, maybe more of a freak than Megan M.

           Ugh, my mother makes me mad.  Why do women have the unique ability to take anything you say and turn it against you? She infuriates me. A little advice for anyone that doesn't already know. Do not get in the middle of your parent's arguments, and if you do be very careful not to say anything that could be turned against you.  Which means be very careful not to say anything at all.  And don't make one parent think you are siding with the other because then you are just asking for it.  I think that it may be easier to vent your frustration on your kids than on your spouse. Your parents have a fight and somehow they end up joining forces to yell at you for butting in their business.  I wonder if couples that don't have kids take out their anger on pets.  It seems to be the next logical step.  But what about the people who treat their animals better than they treat their children?  Do they yell at the animals before they yell at the kids? So many unanswered questions.        I don't know maybe I am the only person that gets in the middle of his parents arguments.  I doubt any of you have noticed but I have a tendency to get involved in other people's business.  I just need to butt out.  My parents are right! ( I can't let them know that, of course) I think life would be easier if I didn't care so much about what was going on in other people's lives, but it is interesting, you know.  You find out a lot of stuff about people through conversations you are eavesdropping on.  Not always stuff you want to know but. . .anyway.        Oh, I just thought of something.  Everybody needs a blog.  I have vented my frustration on my computer and not angered anyone. Why can't everybody just sit down and type when they are mad, instead of taking it out on their kids or pets? Because not everybody has a computer.  But if they did you would have a lot of problems.  Computer people would be really busy all the time, though they probably wouldn't mind if they were getting paid. And internet cable service would be really slow.  But even if everyone had a computer they might not have the internet, oops, i'm rambling. Anyway you shouldn't take out your anger on other people.  It just isn't fair.  So next time you are angry, don't yell at your sister or your dog (I would never yell at Belle, by the by) just type.    My new motto:  Don't yell, just type. Nevermind that really sucks.  I am going to go to bed now because I am a seventy year old in a fifteen year olds body. At least this is Gregg's assesment of my life.  It probably is true. Maybe not, it's just something to think about.

          Hey Maureen, I really don't care who gets scared when you smack their butts.  So please do not make that your default message on AOL anymore.  Although, I must say I find it quite humorous.

           Hey everybody.  My idea is to list everyone that I talk to on a regular basis and my opinion of them.  It will probably take a really long time so bear with me.  My preliminary list will follow this posting and if you think that you got left off of it, you probably did because your name isn't on the list.  Tell me if you think you should be on it or if you think someone else should be on it and I will make my decision about whether or not the person is worthy of this honor.  Keep in mind that the list is by when I talk to people in class.  If you are high on the list YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL, you just have a morning class with me.  Here we go: First we have the people who are stupid enough to take early bird strength training. David T. Ben U. Megan Mc. Then we have those in the doomed orchestra program. Kristen N. The ever interesting health class. Gregg S. Kelly O'B. I have no friends in the Library. The art class, what else can I say. Ryan R. The first of my privileged lunch tables. Bethany M.  Autumn P. Niki K. Kayleigh C. Spencer W. The other lunch table. Brandi N. Adam S. Megan J. Jennifer J. English, I hope I am not plagerising! Katie M. Espanol. Vosotros es gordo, estupido, y feo. Unfortunately, I have already seen everyone that I want to talk to in another class. Same situation with Algebra II.  You can't talk in that class, you have to pay attention, or jump out a window. The most exciting hour of the day, Physical Science. Kurt H. Laurel B.                                             Here are all the other people that I will talk to, but don't talk to them in any particular class. Kelsi C. Jenny B. Megan C.                                             These are the people I talk to, if your name isn't on the list I didn't forget you,I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU!  However, if you think that I left you off my list but you really do talk to me, well then,                                             you are both wrong and illiterate because I already said I DON'T LIKE YOU IF YOU AREN'T ON MY LIST!  I hope that I haven't angered anyone, oh wait, no I don't.    Remember, this is not the final list.  I have not yet posted my opinions of you, but I know you are looking forward to it.  Talk to you later, I can say this because I talk to everyone on this list. Ciao.

      I haven't blogged in a while.  I haven't had much to say.  I am tired, still halfway asleep. I'll get back to this on a regular basis right after the play. Sitting in the pit and playing is tiring.  I can't imagine how all of you that are on the stage do it.  Gonna sleep some more.

         The whole" Where is Raed" blog.  Previously the author of that particular blog enlightened us on a daily basis.  He hasn't blogged since Friday, two hours before we kicked the living shit out of everything in Baghdad.  He might be dead.  I hope not, I really find his blog interesting.  Anyway I am really,really,really tired and exhausted.  Last night I was up until 1:30 in the morning.  Not late for most of you but I am the person that goes to bed at nine on weekends.  I would rather not go to school tomorrow but you know I will be there.  At least I won't have any school on Thursday or Friday!  Hah, people think people that are involved with the play are stupid.  Who is stupid? Gregg no longer thinks that I am a seventy year old man in a fifteen year old's body.  He thinks that I am a seventy year old woman in a fifteen year old's body. Maybe I am.  Who knows?  I am not making much sense here, so I am going to go take a nap.    "Be careful going to sleep, you might not wake up."

         My sister just got yelled for being a whiny little brat.  It's funny.  Five minutes ago I had absolutely nothing to write about.  I posted it, and my sister got yelled at. Coincidence? I think not. My theory is that God is up there reading the blogs. You just say whats going on and if he thinks he wants to help, he does.  Hmmm.  What does God do in his spare time?  He knows everything that has ever happened and ever will happen.  To Him time could go by at an infinite speed. He wouldn't be able to watch t.v., He would what was going to happen.  I wonder if He gets bored.  Maybe God has a blog!  Our task is to find it.  Hey God, if you are out there I would appreciate your address.  I want to read your blog.  Everyone keep your eyes peeled, it may be out there.  That is a disgusting saying if you think about it.  Peel your eyes! Who would want to peel their eyes? I don't even know how you would go about doing something like that.  Wow. Hey, everybody needs to check out Where is Raed?  It is being written by someone that is in Baghdad. Not an ally but a citizen of Iraq.  It is kind of freaky, but fascinating.    Salam pax

          I have nothing to blog about.  It is rather unfortunate.  Sorry, this is a boring blog. I felt obligated to put something since it has been ten days.  I felt obligated to a computer.  I am pathetic.  I am also very tired.  I am also very bored.  I  hate chinese food.  My mom doesn't like chinese either.  We are going to get something else.  POOP, it is a funny word.

      Don't Worry, Be Happy.  This isn't working.  I am not happy.  Poop. I would appreciate it if everyone would do me a favor and chill out.  A wise man once said,"My momma said life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get." Well I guess he didn't really say it, his momma said it. So I guess it was a wise woman(as if there is any such thing).  Anyway, my belief is if you don' t like the chocolate you just pulled out and bit into because it is coconut, which is disgusting, then do what you would in real life.  Throw the nasty coconut chocolate away and pull out a new chocolate.  Maybe you will get something better, maybe not.  If you don't like what is going on in your life right now, then change it and buy some chocolate.  I like chocolate, but not the coconut.  My life isn't a coconut chocolate, but it isn't so much of a dark chocolate chocolate either.  It's more of an orange chocolate.  Which is fine with me, I like orange chocolates.  This is my wisdom.  Listen to it or don't.  Just don't complain to me.

          I feel frustrated.  I really don't think you people understand what the list of friends is about.  The final paragraph of that blog was a joke. I have lots of friends that I didn't put on the list.  I only listed the people that I talk to on a daily basis, I mean actually talk to.  Not just a "hi" in the halls, but a conversation.  I am sorry to all those people that I consider my friends that were not put on the list, but if I listed everyone that I say hello to, it would take forever.  I hope I didn't offend anyone, if I did then maybe you should kill me or something.  Thank you Elizabeth for bringing this to my attention, I apologize.

      WOW!  I am going to be really busy this week.  Monday I had a scout meeting.  Tonight I have a communication merit badge class (I don't want to go but it is required for my eagle, every benefit has a drawback).  Wednesday I go to patrol leader council meeting.  The senior members of the troop decide what the scouts will be doing for the next month.  Thursday is music festival rehearsal. Friday is music festival.  Mrs. Nolte has no idea what she is doing setting up the chairs.  She expected us to set them up without so much as a seating chart.  urgh.  I hope we sound good,  I really think we will.    Surgery last Tuesday was good.  I was in very little pain.  The anesthetic along with tylenol and codine makes you feel better.  Actually, it makes you feel nothing at all.  I shouldn't have gone back to school Wednesday.  The oral surgeon told me not to, but how can you miss the excitment of the first day of school after a break?  My mouth is healing up just fine.  Tomorrow I have another appointment in Springfield.  The stitches or "sutures" as they call them will be removed.  I was told to expect "minimal pain" tomorrow.  There is no such thing as minimal pain.  I don't deal well with pain.  The appointment is at 7:40 a.m.  We have to leave Taylorville at 6:30.  POOP.  Well, I will be off to my communication class now.  All I have to do tonight is get my card signed.  I'll probably be there until 9:00.  I hate when things interfere with sleep.  People don't want to bother others in the morning so they schedule events for the evening.  I am an early bird.  I hate late events.  Why can't we have events at 7:00 in the morning.  Much more convienient. Ciao

      My life is so boring.  I wish it were more exciting.   No, I don't.  If my life were more exciting, I would want more time to relax and do nothing.   I don't understand what my purpose is.  I have no goals for the distant future.   I want to be happy.  I am happy, most of the time.    Too much pressure,  I don't understand.    I should embrace the future.  I don't.  I fear the future. What is to come?  What will happen when people stop making decisions for me?  I will make the wrong decisions, but I don't want to.  I don't want to be a nobody.  I want to be somebody, who doesn't stand out. So many questions.  So many worries. So many fears.  I don't understand why I am here. I want to contribute.  I haven't so far.  I want to feel needed.  Without feeling need. Does everyone understand?  I am the only one?

      I think I am going to puke.  I ate way too much candy about half an hour ago.  My stomach hurts.  I gave up candy for lent, so I don't think my body is used to it anymore. Got lots of good candy. It tastes so good but makes you feel so crappy if you eat too much.  Please help me.  I am being drawn toward the chocolate bunny.  It is evil.  It possesses my mind.  The only way to stop it is to bite off the bunny's head. No, I don't want to eat you little bunny, but I must.  I didn't know that bunnies had teeth. They look kind of shar.......AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  Watch out for the cute, fluffy ones, they are dangerous.

      Hey everybody! What is going on in your lives?... Oh wait, I really don't care.  This blog is about me not you.  Not much is happening in my life right now.  Only a month and a half until I get my license, it seems like forever. I don't really know why I want a license-I won't be going anywhere.  I think it is simply the idea of being able to escape whenever I need to.    I often think about what goes through other peoples' heads. How they think, what they think, the way that people view the world around them, it all fascinates me. When you hear a song, what does it mean to other people?  When you view a piece of art, how do other people see it?  When something happens, how would other people have reacted to the situation?  Sure you can ask them, but you probably won't get a truthful answer.  Even if they are trying to tell the truth they can't describe how they think, exactly what went through their head.  I don't know maybe it is just part of my nosy nature, I just think about it a lot.  How can people do things without thinking about them.  I try to think about the consequences of my actions before I make them. I am not saying I have never blurted out something that I regret, I have many times, I just wonder about people. I believe that everyone views and interprets what is around them in a different way.  Where one person sees crap, the other sees beauty.  Two people may both see the same dilapidated, old building but one sees something that somebody should clean up, they other sees an opportunity to do good in the community. What about color? I see a color I know as red. You see a color you know as green. What if  they are the same color? Imagine if that is true, we would all have a completely different perspective of the world. I see dark, you see light. And who is to say it can't happen or it isn't true?          Maybe I think too much.  I just want people to see their enviroment from other perspectives. You see your life as a horrible existence, there has to be someone that has it worse than you, that wants your life.   Think before you speak.

        I just got my schedule confirmation for next year in the mail.  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  This sucks so freaking much. An EIGHT hour day.  EIGHT hours to fit in every class.  I planned my entire high school career around a nine hour day with early bird.  I have been completely screwed over! I love art and orchestra.  I hate strength training with a passion. Yet the government feels that it is more important that we all be a bunch of big muscular jocks than a bunch of intelligent artistic people who can express our feelings.  Why do they think that they know what is better for me than I do. Why isn't band or orchestra required? We would have much better math scores and live more fullfilling lives. I don't know what I am going to do.  I feel like screaming a whole lot of really inappropriate obscenities!  I have to go talk to my counselor tommorrow, I don't know what she can do.  Maybe she can give me a second early bird, no no, she will drink her coffee and say,"Oh I'm sorry, you'll have to drop a class" all the while thinking," When will this kid leave my office. I have some important solitare to get back to." That isn't fair. Mrs. Sawyer didn't do anything to me, I just am frustrated. No I'll rephrase that:   I AM FREAKING PISSED!

      It has been a few days since I have blogged.  Sorry about all of those stupid little blogs; I was trying to figure out how to change my blog site.  As you can see it hasn't worked out too well near the links.  Oh well. No big deal, at least the links work-I think.    As most of you know, Star Trek is a large part of my life. You may laugh and think that I am freak(not saying that I'm not) but how many of you can honestly say that Star Trek is crap. If you watch it enough you begin to understand something about every Star Trek series;The underlying messages. Gene Rodenberry created Star Trek to be an intellectual show.  A show that made you think and wonder. Watch the show-there is no prejudice, no poverty.  Who wouldn't want to live in a world where the basis of everything is that everyone, no matter what race, religion, or species, is created equal?  Is that not what our country's government is based on? There is no greed.  A person's goal in life is not to get rich and get as much "stuff" as they can, it is to better your self and the lives of everyone around you. Can you imagine the world without hate?   When you think of a trekkie, you probably think of a 30 year-old man who lives with his parents and wears Spock ears to dinner.  Or maybe you think of weirdos at conventions who think that they live in the Star Trek Universe.  There are people like this, but most trekkies aren't like this at all. They are people who simply enjoy watching a show, and sometimes participating in it. They want to live in a better world, a better universe.  Next time you are in a group of people you know, look around.  Notice the trekkies.  They are probably the nicest or politest people in the group.  They want to live in a better world and right now their escape from this pretty sucky world is Star Trek. Conventions aren't groups of freaks that are dressing up to show off.  They are groups of intelligent people who enjoy the company of people that have the same hopes for the future.    Don't make fun of trekkies. They enjoy a television show with a deeper meaning than most.  You can have your opinions about Star Trek and trekkies, but do not make fun of them.  Especially if you have never so much as seen a show.  It is really quite sad that we live in a world that taunts at people and laughs at people because they want a better life for themselves and everyone else.    In the famous words of Spock," Live long and prosper my good friend."

      Niki made the comment that not many people have blogged lately. This made me realize that I had not blogged for a while either. So I will talk about some stuff--I don't know what. I enjoy not having homework, especially in Algerbra. I am thinking that there probably aren't a whole lot of classes that you look forward to tests in. I like algebra tests.  They mean no homework the night before or the night of the test.  Unless of course you study.  I don't.  I really never have. I get very bored studying.  I seem to retain knowledge fairly well. Also, I honestly don't know that studying would help me do all that much better.  Who knows? Maybe I should try it.   How many times do I have to tell you people that I am right and you are wrong?  In art, I tell Judd not to use so much stain. Does he listen? Of course not! The bell rings. Everyone runs to lunch. I continue picking up the mess SOME of us made. The stain had soaked through the paper. It was on the desk.  I had to clean it, although I really didn't mind. Turpentine really stinks. It is so oily and greasy. I have to give a special thanks to Sam P. for helping me clean. Mrs. Benepe asked me while I was cleaning up if Judd knew that the stain had been there. I told her that he didn't and it wasn't any big deal for me to clean.  She later calls him to her room to ask him a question about a test he had taken.  He thought he was in trouble.  Told her that he had done it. Besides making himself look stupid (which isn't that hard to do) she probably thinks that I lied to her.  At least this is the story that I heard. May not be true, I'll find out tomorrow. Wasn't that big of a deal and although it sounds like it, I am not mad at all.  I found it kind of funny. In all truth, that is all I had to blog about.  My life is so incredibly boring.  Except for Star Trek. What would I do without the Star Trek Universe. Who cares? I am a true trekkie, not a trekker.  I'll explain the difference in my next blog.  You might actually find it interesting!  Procrastination equals Stupidity.  I don't know what this has to do with anything, but it is the truth.  Just think about it.

      It's over.  This school year has come to an end.  I am both happy and sad about this.  This was a really great year for me.  I made some new friends and reconnected with a lot of old friends.  I realized that my favorite class is art.  I have to drop it next year.  This isn't a long blog, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone that contributed to my enjoyment this year.  I hope we all have fun next year.  This marks the end of my school year blogs and the beginning of my summer blogs.  Everyone have a great summer!

      I apologize for not blogging for a while.  The previous week I have been rather busy.  I keep on planning to study for semesters,  I just don't get around to doing it.  I should really go study.  Anyway,  As I predicted last week was a very good week.  Some people said they thought it went by very slowly, but I thought it flew by.  I saw Bruce Almighty this weekend.  Everyone I went with liked it but I really wasn't too crazy about it.  There were funny parts but nothing that made you pee your pants and fall out of you chair in a fit of abdominal convulsions.  I just think I wasn't in the mood to see Jim Carey.  Who knows?  Today was fun.  Our friends from Wisconsin who were staying at our neighbors house just bought a brand new corvette.  Jim, one of the Wisconsin friends and also the owner of the corvette, took me out for a little spin.  Or should I say I took him for a spin?  I cannot believe he let me drive.  It was good.  It was fun.  I also just played nine holes with my dad.  There were these old people, unbelievably slow.  They started in front of us at the first tee.  We were tired of waiting so we went around them.  I played very well.  We finished, went home for an hour, went out to Arby's, and as we were approaching our house we see them.  They were on the sixth hole.   They were having fun though, that's all that counts.  I am going to go study.   No. Wait! Star Trek is on.  Ciao.

      I don't have much to say today.  I had a lot of fun at the spring camporee at Camp Bunn.  Only David would be able to light a fire in the middle of a rainstorm.  It was probably one of the best campouts I have ever been on.  I met a lot of new, fun people.  Our scoutmaster wasn't a complete jerk.  We played capture the flag at 10:30 in total darkness.  I am really looking forward to the high-adventure trip this summer.  We are going to Florida and although we have made our own itinerary, I think it will be better than going to SeaBase, and a lot less expensive.  I think this is going to be a pretty good week.  I was dreading the English project but now that we have started it,  I am having fun.  We watched Shrek in Spanish.  Orchestra is also gearing up for a trip to Chicago.  I hope that I will be able to go. Three weeks until my birthday.  I am looking forward to summer.  It should be fun.  I am in a really good mood.  I just need to give a special thanks to Autumn and Bethany for their little "note"book.  I will talk to some of you tomorrow.  I won't talk to others.  Ciao.

      Yesterday was a whole heck of a lot of fun! I didn't want to go to school today.  Not much choice.  I heard some people saying that they thought the Music Man sucked!  I thought it was really good and I enjoyed it a lot.  I also enjoyed sitting in the massage chairs in Brookstone.  I did not enjoy changing on the bus.  We were told we couldn't change in the mall bathrooms.  Stupid liability issues. I like oldies.  I also have begun to enjoy the sound of disco and 70's music.  I am only about thirty years behind the rest of you.  I am ready for school to be over.  Campout this weekend.  It should be fun if it doesn't suck.  I am feeling the pressures of SPL (senior patrol leader).  Stupid people don't listen to what I tell them to do and then they wonder why they don't have any food to eat.  I met my sister's boyfriend half an hour ago.  Umm,  he is bigger than I am.  I am rather frightened by him.  From what my sister tells me he fights quite often.  He could definitely kick my ass.  Then again, a four year old could probably kick my ass.  I would rather not do the English project.  Gregg is going to have to be a girl ,  hahaha.  Mr. Chase is the only teacher I know that doesn't round grades up.  Today he gave me 93.74 percent.  It is a freaking 94 percent grade.  AHHHHH.  I need to pack for this weekend.   I realized today that I have a problem with sharing.  I don't know how to do it. I am still thinking about college and the many problems I have with it. I was thinking about living at college and it dawned on me, I will have to live in place with other people and probably have to share a bathroom with nine million other people.  I have NEVER had to share anything.  I have always had my own bedroom and bathroom.  I need my personal, sanitary space.  I also think that I have found another fear that has to do with the future.  Maybe I am not scared of the future at all.  I am scared of not having money.  I know it shouldn't be that important to me but I have never done without anything.  My parents have provided quite well for me and I don't know if I will be able to do the same.  I seriously wonder if I need professional help.  I worry so much about things I have no control over.  Worrying about the future should not interfere with my life.  I have problems.  Everybody has problems.  Sorry if my problems are boring to you but quite honestly I need a vent.  I try to have fun but everything I do turns into a chore.  That is why I need days like yesterday.  I wanted to roll down the hill but then I thought what if I hit my head on the concrete or rip my shirt or stain my pants.  So I sat on the side of the hill and watched everyone else roll down the hill.  Hhhhhhhhhh.  It was still fun though.  Actually,  Yesterday was a whole heck of a lot of fun!

      What to Blog about? What to blog about?  I have not much to say.   It has been one whole week, WOW!  As Megan M. pointed out this morning in strength training, this year has flown by. I don't think she realized it but she kind of sent me into panic mode for the day.  I have issues, you all know that.  One of my "issues" is the immediate future.  Jennifer J. calls it paranoia.  I don't think I am paranoid, I just worry about things I have no control over (again the perfectionist coming out in me).  I am worried about college. First of all, where will I go.  Everyone seems to know what they want to do with their life.  I have no idea.  I had an inspiration and I told my mom.  I will spend four years getting a bachelor's degree and figuring out what I want to do with my life, then grad school getting the education that I need for my selected field.  That sent my mother into panic mode.  Primarily because I am looking at very small, very private, and very  expensive  schools.  She doesn't want me to have to pay off college loans for the rest of my life, or so she says.  I think it is more that my parents don't want to be paying for eight or nine years of college.  I try to explain my fear, but no one seems to understand.  You all embrace what comes next while I am running as fast as I can the other way.  I need structure in my life.  Someone telling me what choices to make.  Maybe I should go to an asylum.  They tell you exactly what to do, all in a very positive environment.  Hmmmmm.   I am scared of the dark that is what is to come.

       WAL-MART   The whole idea behind wal-mart is convenience.  I have begun thinking.  Is Wal-Mart really all that convenient?  It is nice that Wal-Mart has everything you will probably ever need.  Unfortunately, the store is so freaking enormous that it is virtually impossible to go grab something quickly from Wal-Mart.  I go in there for one thing and by the time I get there, get what I need, get checked out, and arrive back home at least an hour has passed.  Which brings me to my next point.  Wal-Mart is not exactly in a convenient place for many people including myself.  It is on the other side of town, I know Taylorville isn't that big but I still don't like it.  There prices are low.  That's nice, for everyone except the people who used to own the small neighborhood stores.  Family stores are now non-existent because Wal-Mart ran them out of business.  I long for the times when no matter where in town you lived there was a store no more than two blocks away.  I find the past fascinating.  My grandparents tell me stories that I think are unbelievable, and they would be if they happened today.  For example, my grandma Jean used to go to the neighborhood bar everyday after school.  She would get out of school and go home.  She was given a small bucket by her mother and was sent down the street to fetch a pail of beer for her father.  I find especially funny considering this activity began when she was in fourth grade.  How would you react if you saw a fourth grader walking down the street with a bucket of beer?  I kind of got off on a tangent.  Anyway,  Wal-Mart's "convenience" is not so convenient.  Maybe you disagree with me, but I don't care!  Perhaps I will amuse you with some more family stories at another time but not right now.  Music festival rehearsal is tonight.  I would rather not go but I have no choice.  There is only one reason I look forward to music festival: The Battle Hymn of the Republic.  Specifically,  the part the high school choir sings. Really choir people, It gives me goosebumps every year.  I would love to be part of it, but I will never join choir and since that is the primary requirment...  Just one of those things I will forever regret and yet know that if I had been in choir I would have been miserable.    Is it possible to regret a regret?

      Where does the time go?  It is a question that I have heard several times this week and it got me thinking.  Does time just dissolve away the second after it happens?  Or is our past eaten by the landoliers? Or does time just sit there after we move on to the present, waiting for us to return?    I then began wondering about "time lines."  If we are on a time line then we must be moving forward.  Which begs the question, are we all in the present? Well, if we are all on a time line we can't all be in the present.  Whoever is at the front of the line is in the future when we are in the present but we are in their past.  Also, logically if we are moving forward on a time line then we should be able to run backward to get to the past.  However we won't know we are in the past because it will be wherever we are's present time.  We should also be able to run forward into the future.  If we are actually moving forward then there is momentum.  Whenever we hit a snag in the time line, time stops for just a tiny second.  Some people stay with the present and the pause for a slight second also.  A few others are "out there" and when time stops the momentum of their bodies is still moving.  Therefore, they run into walls or trip and are knocked back into the present.  This explains why people are a little clumsy...hmm...andrea, megan.    I have figured out the answers to time travel!  I should be published somewhere.  I am a genius.  Well, maybe not but if you disagree then the only way to explain your clumsiness is that you actually do run into things and fall over them.

      I am extremely tired. Nay, exhausted. I have worked really hard the last two days.  Don't trust or believe your parents.  "It'll only take you and David about two hours," said my dad.  A family friend just built a new house and wanted me and a friend to go rake and weed wack.  We worked yesterday, we worked today, we will work again tomorrow.  That still may not be the end of it.  A "two hour project" is still incomplete after 9 and half hours.  We raked, we weed-wacked, we even mowed, and the yard looked great.  She told us she wanted a few rocks moved so we went out this morning.  We moved a few rocks.  Actually they weren't so much rocks as they were 20 to 40 pound flagstone tiles. It took two hours.  We thought we were done and we felt pretty good.  She came out but there was no" WOW, the yard looks great" or "I really appreciate this."  Instead we recieved the thanks in a rather unusual way.  She told us everything that we missed or did "wrong" and we were told to do some more raking and weed-wacking.  We didn't get mad or even make faces.  We just worked for another three hours.  She returns.  "It is starting to look nice" she says.  That is followed by,"Tomorrow I want the side yard mowed, the front ditch weed-wacked and cleaned up, and meet me at Wal-mart in the morning so we can pick up some mulch for you to put down." "Oh, I also want you to move all of the fire logs up onto the concrete blocks."  Will this work never end?  I suppose I shouldn't complain though, we are getting paid and it is work.  I am so exhausted.  Monday I am going to Springfield to a refresher course.  For what you ask?  Scuba diving of course.  I am gettting geared up for my trip to florida.  I cannot wait.

      I miss school and I have yet to find a job.  I don't miss the homework,  I miss the social interaction.  I miss the library.  I miss the insulting people to their faces only to have them laugh.  You know your good friends with people when you can tell them that they are fat, ugly, stupid, or really fat.  I suppose I could go out and see my friends.  Hahaha.  I judge people.  It is one of my weaknesses, one of my flaws.  Contrary to popular belief I am neither perfect nor God.  Anyway, not only do I judge people I try to compare them to people of a specific group, my peers.  When I meet people I ask myself, "If they were my age, who in my class would they be?"  I believe that some, not everyone, has a "clone" in every generation.  By clone I mean people who act, think, and treat others the same.  I look at my parents and from the stories I have heard about them I create the person they would be, or the person that they were.  I ask myself if I would be friends with them.  My mom was a hard-working overachiever.  I think I would be friends with my mother.  On the other hand, my dad was a popular jock, not to mention an asshole. I don't think I would be friends with him.  My sister is a pretentious ditz.  I know how she is and who her friends are.  I can say without a doubt that if she were two years older we still would not be friends.  It is just something to think about in your spare time.  A word of advice:  If you are thinking about people much older than you, don't think about if you would be friends with them the way they are now.  Think about if you would be friends with them when they were your age.

      Why is it that there are people you just don't like?  I was thinking today about the people that I really dislike.  For some of them I have good reasons to not like but others I don't.  I feel bad for disliking these certain people so much, I really haven't given them a chance.  There are just people that I meet and my brain instantly tells me that you don't like them. Anyway...  I don't know what to blog about.  I have no inspiration.  I really hope this is a blog that people occasionally enjoy reading.  I apologize that the last few blogs have sucked.  I will rally and hope for a good blog in the next few days.

      I had a very unusual dream last night.  I also remember it very vividly, which is not typical for me.  A normal day in English class except for the absence of Ms. Pedigo.  That was how it started.  We had a substitute that looked strangely familiar, gray and balding, he was wearing all black.  Out of nowhere he pulls out a weird looking machine gun and all of his followers burst in through the windows.  They busted through the windows in a upward direction which makes it seem like they jumped from the ground but I really don't know because I didn't see them.  I was sitting in my old seat in the back, right hand corner of the room.  The sub just starts randomly picking people out by name and shooting them.  He killed a bunch of people that tried to escape out the door.  Then he shot Morgan Watson in the stomach.  Then he turned his gun to me and told me he wouldn't make me suffer.  He shot me in the head 16 times.  I was dead and no one, except the other dead people who were sitting in desks,  could see or hear me.  Then he shot Katie Manson but I don't know where.  I asked someone if we were in heaven and whoever it was said that it was probably pergatory.  Suddenly we are all in some kind of a field with a grain elevator in the middle but if you looked down you could see Stonington.  Everyone from English was there but nobody else.  I was looking at the grain elevator and turned around only to find Ms. Pedigo standing behind me.  Somehow I just understood the second I saw her that she was God.  She made a speech to everyone standing around that since we were going to be here for a while we could take English classes.  Bethany and I were the only two that signed up but then I left.  Another sudden jump and we are all standing on top of a fence having no trouble balancing.  We followed some signs looking for grapes and we made it to some building in Clinton.  Spencer told everyone that Clinton was famous for its grape jelly.  We looked out the windows and saw a lot of old people, sitting on their porches, canning grapes.  We wanted to pick our own grapes but they apparently had stopped that practice because people got hurt.  I don't really know how we could have gotten hurt if we were dead.  Ms. Pedigo/God Almighty was very upset because we went all the way to Clinton to pick grapes and we couldn't.  I didn't understand why God wouldn't have known that they stopped picking grapes in Clinton.  We jumped out of the windows onto the fence and started again to walk home to the field above Stonington.    I woke up and looked at my clock.  It was 2:30 in the morning.  I never wake up in the middle of the night.  This dream is going to provoke a lot of analyzing on my part.  I have a feeling that Ms. Pedigo isn't God, but you never know.

      I had a great time on my trip and I just got home.  I opened my schedule.  Hmmm, let's see.  What classes am I signed up for?  The ones that I specifically crossed off on my schedule confirmation.  What classes am I not signed up for?  Only the ones that I need to get in order to attend college.  I don't want to deal with these stupid scheduling problems and I really have a sincere desire to yell FUCK as loud as I can, but since I can't because I will be in trouble I will yell it into cyberspace.          FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!  Let's just say that I am really, really pissed off right now.  Why? because my dad is being an ass right now and I really don't know what is up his butt.  It began a few weeks ago when he told me my hair was too long and that I needed to get it cut.  After some negotiating we came to an agreement that I would cut my hair.  Today I went in to have my hair cut.  Lorenne cut my hair very well and to my exact specifications.  Toward the end of the hair cut who do you suppose came striding through the door? My dad. He looked at my hair, told me it was still too long, and told me he wouldn't pay unless she cut more off.  He knew full well I had no money.  She cut it off.  He butchered it.  He is pretending like nothing happened and I am restraining myself from screaming vulgarness at him.  My self control is very low right now, which doesn't happen very often, and if he says anything more to me I really think I could kill him.

      I am growing tired.   I am growing tired by the year. By the season. By the month. The week. The day. Hour by hour. Minute by minute. Seconds pass. I am tired. Tired of waiting. For school. For life to begin. For death to arrive. For ten o'clock. For lunch. For two, three, four. For supper. For tommorrow. Waiting makes me tired. And so the cycle continues.

      Prepare for the complaints.  I started a new job today and I believe that if I had to describe it in one word I know what that word would be.  monotony .  I am working for the secretary of state in the department of motor vehicles.  I was told I would be "processing license plates" and that is what I am doing.  The job, unfortunately, is not the excitement I was hoping for.  I look at the numbers on the license plate, I look at the numbers on the identification card, if they match, and they always do, I put the id in the the envelope on the license package and seal it.  I found that it takes me about 10-15 minutes to "process" 50 plates. I worked for about 7.5 hours today.  Today I processed approximately 1875 license plates.  The same thing over and over and over and over and over. . .

      I have a theory.  That is that everyone is just a little bit psychic.  Here is how I came to this  conclusion:       I woke up this morning and just had the general feeling that today wasn't going to be very good.  I got in my car this morning and my garage door opener wouldn't work.  I had to go inside, press the button, and then run under the closing door.  Nothing bad happened at school.  I come home from school and I went to type my English paper.  I wouldn't print and I don't know why.  I went downstairs to figure it out and it turns out the drivers aren't loaded.  Of course, I can't find the drivers to load them meaning that I can't print.  I saved it to a floppy disk; I will print it tomorrow.  I went to work.  A lady came in and handed me a ten, I entered it as a twenty on the computer but managed to give her the correct change.  So on the readout it looks like ten dollars is missing.  I wrote him a note and let's hope he doesn't think I stole ten dollars.  Sean Graham comes in and begins telling me about how school is pointless and he hated summer school.  Meanwhile, he is using the most atrocious language I have heard in years and I am thinking why do I care about his schooling? Later, a guy calls and says, and this is word for word,"I know the country club is for members only but can non-members play...no...So I can't play?...Are you a member?...no...Then you can only play if you are with a member...he hangs up.  I am washing a cart and the hose gets a kink in it. I pulled to undo the kink and the hose spun in my hands, this is a hose that doesn't turn off, and drenched me.  I park the last cart and realize there is a cart missing! I go to the pro shop and there isn't anyone signed up to be on the course with a cart.  I get ready to call my boss and a lady drives up, unloads her clubs, and parks the cart.  She didn't pay for it, nor did she tell me she was playing.  I go to park that cart and pull into the shed too quickly and run into the wall.  Oh well, no damage done.  I close up but the door won't lock and it took me five minutes to get my keys out of the door.  I go to my car and unlock it, open the door and the alarm goes off.  The alarm which I never armed in the first place! It took me ten minutes to remember how to disarm it because it is rather complicated and people are staring at me through the window in the bar.  I get home, finally, and what won't work.  That's right the garage door opener; I have to go to the front door.  The phone rings but the cordless phone isn't working so I run to another phone where the caller hangs up.  Could the day get any worse? Let's hope not.  So the question is:   Am I kind of psychic and knew the day was going to turn out crappy   OR!                                   Did I make the day crappy because I told myself it was going to be!

      Last week was superb.  Yes, superb. I know it is a funny word but I like it! I like my schedule and my teachers.  I miss orchestra but I will only be out of it first semester.  I am ready for Scholastic Bowl to begin.  Mr. Daley said that we will start in a few weeks.  Taco Gringo is good!  I was supposed to go to St. Louis today.  Our troop was going to go to Cahokia Mounds and the Arch.  It would have been fun but alas, not enough people wanted to go so it was cancelled at the last minute.  I could have worked today had I known that we weren't going.  My mother took Belle to the vet this morning.  She had to have her nails trimmed.  I really don't have anything interesting to say so I shall leave it right here.

      So my sister is somewhat dramatic, the story begins at Spencer's house...We are watching American Pie 2 with Niki and Bethany and my phone rings.  I see it is home calling and I answer it.  Instead of recieving the usual, "What are you doing, will you go to Dairy Queen", I hear this horrible high pitched wailing.  So loud that everyone looks at me and they turn the movie off.  Being the worry-wort that I am I instantly assume somebody is dead.  I run through who it could be in my mind, mom, dad, grandma, grandpa.  The only people that I care about and then she says my ankle hurts.  She sprained it quite badly although she is dramatic.  I am sure none of you really cared about the story as it was very boring and pointless, like most of my stories, I have a tendency to go off on tangents, anyway I had nothing to blog about.  I am so excited, school starts in less than two weeks! I think tangents are an interesting way to make conversations flow from one topic to another.

      I really don't understand the concept of smoking cigarettes.  I never have and since I have such an incredible disdain for the habit, I probably never will understand it.  I don't like it, but I tolerate it without saying too much.  If any of you smoke or are going to smoke at anytime in the future, besides asking you to quit or not start, I want you to be polite in your smoking.  That's right, be polite! I am not saying that every smoker is rude in their habits.  In fact, many are very polite but it really aggravates me when a smoker has no concern for the non-smoker.  Examples:            At work there are about twelve people at the table, three student workers and a bunch of middle-aged guys.  The older guys smoke, which in itself I don't understand how they are allowed to do in a state building, but that isn't the point.  They smoke a combination of cigarettes and cigars and insist on exhaling in my direction.  In a normal situation like this I would get up and walk away.  However, I can't walk away since I am at work and it wouldn't be appropriate to say anything to them considering both of my bosses smoke like chimneys.  So I sit there, inhaling the carcinogens of the second hand smoke, coughing, and wondering why it would be so hard to blow the smoke the other direction.            Thursday I went out to eat with my dad at lunch.  We went to a little restaurant that has really good food and we are sitting there eating.  In comes an elderly gentleman and he sits down at the table next to us.  What is the next thing that he does?  He lights up, appears to enjoy it and then begins looking around on the table for an ash tray.  Look around old man, no one is smoking in this room, everyone is smoking in the other room, there are no ash trays on these tables, there are ash trays on the tables in the other room.  Is it that hard to figure out that you are in a no smoking area! I mean really people have a little common sense.  I was thinking about asking the waitress to have him move when she saw him.  She told him that he couldn't smoke in there, he got up and moved.  How can you enjoy food while your sucking tar into your lungs anyway?   I apologize to any of you smokers who pay attention to the non-smokers.  People, just use some common sense when smoking.  Do you honestly think the people who don't smoke want to inhale the shit that has already passed through your respiratory tract?  We don't.  I should move to California, smoking in public places is against the law.

       Yawn    Shiver   It is really cold in here.  I am at work and no one has come in for the last hour.  I am not wearing any shoes and my toes are frigid.  My fingers feel like they are going to fall off.  Fingers, toes, and your nose-they are always the first to go!  At least when it comes to freezing.  I am going to freeze to death, sitting here at the computer, lips blue, no fingers.  No one will miss me, they won't even know that I am gone.  I will become and urban legend.  "That kid that froze at the golf course, He haunts the thirteenth hole, a scenic par four." People will come to the course at twelve midnight on september twenty-third to see my ghost.  I can't find the damn thermostat!  My fingers are sta r t i n g    t  o    f  r  e   e    z  e        c    a     n     t        m     o         v      e        t          h. . .

       hmmm... I am somewhat worried that I may be a pushover or gullable. I just do what everyone tells me to do and I never really stand up for myself.  Wednesday night a couple of guys who weren't members came into the club and wanted to play.  I told them that it wasn't anything personal but because they weren't members they couldn't play.  Five minutes later I had taken their money and they were teeing off.  All I did for the rest of the night was worry about it. I think some of the members were a little pissed off because I noticed that they were backing up play on the course.  Tonight a couple of people came in and I told them how much it would be.  They told me that I was wrong and that there was a special going on.  I charged them what they told me to, even though Jeff, my boss, never said anything about reduced prices.  I don't deal well with pressure and I am worried that if it ever comes to anything serious I am not going to be able to stand up for myself.  I need to do something.  I don't know what.  Just blogging has made me feel better.  On a brighter note, I am miserable with the homework and wouldn't mind killing myself. Morgan was bothered by my extensive knowledge about painless ways to kill yourself but it is just some of my trivial knowledge, always important for scholastic bowl!  I don't want to die a painfull death.    If it was your choice would you live for 90 years with perfect health and then die an extremely painful death  or  would you choose to live for only 65 years and die painlessly?

      Halloween, Once you can't trick or treat anymore it sucks.  It is only the 23rd and already the holiday has taken its toll on me.  Everyone is in such a pleasant mood.  It is really disgusting people.  What makes anything scarrier on the 31st than it is on the 29th.  I am not in a New York state of mind,  I am in a morbid, hellish state of mind.  Where did that come from?  I am feeling very restless because no one is coming into work and I am reallly rather bored.  Wait I think someone is here...nope.  I feel like smashing something like a big ole pumpkin.  Of course, it would have to be my pumpkin because I wouldn't want to smash something someone had put work into,  that is just plain mean.  I want to drop it from the top of a building.  I need a pumpkin.  I could also use a tall building.  I am ready for Christmas.  I know, I know everyone is in a really good mood then too but it is ok because I get presents.  There is absolutely nothing on daytime tv.  Good lord this place is disorganized.  I feel like cleaning it but I can't.  I don't know what I could throw away.  My boss is in Scotland, I wish I were there.  Is Halloween an international holiday?  What about Valentine's Day,  maybe they just celebrate it at a different time in Europe?  It is gloomy in Scotland because it often rains.       I like the rain, as long as it gets stuff wet, good and soaked.  I hate it when the rain falls but then not so much as the concrete is damp.  Do de do de do.  Motown is awesome.  My dad used a deragatory racial slur toward Germans.  Then we got into this big discussion about how you can't say stuff like that, especially in public.  He then tried to convince me that "niger" isn't a bad word as long as you use it when refering to the color and not the race.  He then proceeded to use it in multiple sentences while we are sitting in a restaurant.  People were starring.  He also referred to himself as a "cracker".   I was laughing so hard I thought I was going to pee my pants.  He told my mother that she was a , well, a slur toward Italians.  I think his life probably flashed before his eyes.   My mother has a wonderful gift, as do most women, of making you feel extremely guilt by doing nothing at all.  Subject for a later date.  I apologize for the rambling.

      i'm tired of school of scouts of this stupid eagle project of work of scholastic bowl of science club of art club of piano of these tests of the pressure i feel always nagging at the back of my head of worrying of trying to be positive all the fucking time of trying to see the good in people of wanting and yearning and trying to be perfect in everything i do and knowing that there will always be someone better than me and trying to accept that and not hate myself i have everything contained and i don't show it i just hold it in but i can't anymore i want to run away into nowhere and forget everything and not know anything and not care anymore but i can't and i know it and it is horrible and i just want it to end to be done with i am running a race and i am down crawling i just want to finish i just want it to end but in this race of life there is no end except death and i know this but will keep going until i fall off the face of the earth and all of my effort and pain i put into this life this race will be in vain and will be forgotten and i am tired

      I hope that I am not stepping out of line.  I don't understand the belief that you should respect the dead.  Just because a person dies does not instantly mean that they are or ever were perfect.  You don't respect a person who is an asshole to you, why should you respect him after he dies.  I am not speaking of anyone specific, just in general.  I have been told that you shouldn't walk over dead peoples' graves or yell in cemetaries.  Why?  Do you honestly think the people that are dead are going to care if you are walking on the ground above them?  I don't care.  I went to my grandparents' graves yesterday.  They are buried in Anderson Cemetary.  We were there about eleven-thirty, at night.  We met some nice guys from Chicago, Bethany offered to sleep with one of them in their Mustang.  Anyway,  I'm not saying you shouldn't remember the dead.  Just remember that they were people and they weren't perfect.  Why do some fear dead people?  Most of them were nice elderly folks who would give you candy.  Then they die and suddenly they are someone to be feared.  Even if they did come back as ghosts or spirits why would they want to hurt you?  I know that somewhere in the bible it says that ghosts are sent from the devil but . . . I don't know. . . God can do whatever he wants, he can send ghosts.  Everyone that sees angels says they give you a calming feeling and that ghosts make you cold and uncomfortable.  How the hell are we so sure that the ghosts aren't angels and people just don't believe in them, they fear the unknown.  Why would the devil's ghosts appear to people in churches, the house of God, it doesn't make any sense?  Don't get me wrong, I believe in God, I just think that . . . well, you know, the bible is a book to be interpreted.  We, as humans, have made our fair share of mistakes, let's hope we haven't misinterpreted the Bible too much.  I had no intention of offending anyone, just expressing my opinion.  By the by, if you are going to leave a comment about how I need to "find God and be saved and understand the bible", don't, I know where god is and the church, catholic that is, doesn't believe in being saved and you are full of it if you think that you understand the bible so don't waste my time.  That sounded kind of bitchy, it wasn't the idea I just don't feel like reading it right now.

      Music...  It's incredible, a perfect expression of every emotion.  Mind-boggling, that so many different things can be so clearly expressed through variations on seven simple tones.  There are songs that just instantly put me into a good mood.  For the three minutes that one of those songs is on, there is nothing else in the world.  It is a feeling which is almost impossible to describe.  There are simply no words that do the feeling justice. I think the reason that I like "oldies" so much is that so many of those songs put me into a great mood.  Classical music calms me down.  Modern music makes me feel jumpy and uncomfortable.  However, "oldies" are the only songs that can actually change my outlook on the entire day for the better.  I am beginning to understand why other people enjoy their music so much.  It is because it gives them a feeling that they enjoy and nothing else can give a person the same feeling.  I am going to try to be more tolerent of different styles of music and listen to it more closely.  Who knows, maybe I will be able to find another song that puts me into a good mood.

      This question was posed about one year ago.  I am still debating it in my mind. Not that it is a major decision, but sitting here, listening to the beatles, in the dark...what would I do?  "You have a choice, but you must pick one.  For the rest of your life, will you be blind or deaf?  Initially I thought I would rather be deaf.  I figured that I would still have plenty of freedoms.  I would still my able to see my family, my surroundings.  I think I would feel more secure.  The changing seasons, the beauty of artwork, they would still be with me.  Silence is peaceful.  It has a calming effect on me and not much else does.  and sitting here, thinking.  I would miss everyone's voices.  If I were blind, communication wouldn't be as much of a problem.  I would miss the music, Vivaldi and Bach to the Beatles.  The harmony in people's singing that sends chills through my spine, would be gone forever. No more piano or violin--two devices which help me to truly express myself.  But If I were blind I wouldn't be able to read any of the music.  They are both much too precious.  I am curious, how would you answer the question?

      Today's purpose:  To insight apathy for Andrew  Mr. Schmitz gave a little spiel (I know oxymoron, haha) today in English and it really helped to remind me of how truly pathetic I am.  The speech was about "self-reliance".  Everyone was saying how self-reliant they are and I knew how self-reliant I am not.  I don't cook, I don't clean, which is not to say that I am not extremely clean, I don't contribute to our household.  Hell, I couldn't do a load of laundry if my life depended on it.  Sadly, I am not exagerating.  I don't even set foot in our laundry room unless I need to talk to my mom.  I am worried about college.  I don't share easily and if I have to use the same bathroom as everyone else on a floor I might just not go, to college I mean, not the bathroom.  How I hate worrying!  I just need to relax but I can't.  I thought about yoga but then I learned that it is considered unchristian because you are chanting to "nature", another diety.  I worried about going to hell for that one for quite some time.  I have tried for years but no matter what I do I have never been able to just let go.  I really think I might be one of those people that starts having panic attacks when I am eighteen and by my twenty-second birthday I have already had bypass surgery.  I don't like confrontation.  I hate being uncomfortable but I guess there's not much I can do about that.  So I guess I will have horrible health and die when I am about twenty-six from a massive stroke/heart attack.  But in the end it will turn out that it was actually an overdose.  Not on drugs or alcohol but on laundry detergent because I wasn't sure how much to put into the dryer.  The really sad thing is that it will probably happen.

      Well, it looks like Santa isn't going to become the next novelty New Year's decoration.  Too bad, it would have been fun.  Somehow it is different this year, I don't know why but it just is.  I was tired last night at nine-thirty; I went to bed and fell asleep.  There was none of the Christmas Eve jitters.  I was happy, just not that jumping up and down, can't sleep kind of happy.  There is no snow.  I am glad that it is Christmas, it just seems to be missing something.  I got everything that I wanted.  My mom and sister decided not to go to mass this morning.  It was just me and my dad, it was nice but I wanted my whole family to be there.  The choir sucked as is typical at the morning masses.  I want to go back to the days when Santa Clause was real and I didn't buy my own presents.  The days when my sister and I woke my parents up at five-thirty in the morning to see what we had gotten.  The days when the whole house smelled like Christmas food and there were pounds of my Grandma's candy on every surface in sight.  Those days are gone, Santa Clause turned out to be my parents, I slept in today, and Grandma died six years ago.

      I enjoy ice skating.  Well, I enjoy ice skating but I think I enjoy hanging out with my friends more.  I believe that my ice skating experiences are unlike anyone elses.  Instead of just skating in circles, I have to be on the constant lookout for Gregg and Ryan.  They find it quite fun, and funny, to crash into me and shove me up against the wall.  There are usually a few wrestling moves and I usually end up face first on the ice.  Not today, however, I was skating particularily well so they were having a little more trouble catching me.  I only got knocked down once!  I am so freaking awesome.  I didn't even fall when Ryan picked me up and bounced my head against the wall!  A little later through no person's fault but my own I ran into a door.  That was a riot!  I think a certain history teacher is probably thinking right now about how bad he feels for giving us homework over Christmas break.  And if he isn't maybe he should keep in mind my traditional holiday saying.  It goes as follows:  "If I don't like what I got-and my foot starts a tappin', I'll get a certain look in my eye, you might want to watch out-accidents happen, and people die!"  It isn't a threat, I am just putting that little ditty out there in case someone comes across it who was thinking of giving me shit for the holidays.  That's right Santa, If I get crap this year I'll take Rudolph's shiny little nose and shove it so far up your ass your rosy cheeks will glow brighter than the New Year's Ball in New York.  Then we can drop you from the top of a building and yell "Happy New Year's" as your skull cracks and your white little beard slowly turns a nice shade of crimson.  "Happy Christmas and to all, and to all a good present, damn straight."

      The stresses of semester finals.  I am taking a break from my intensive studying to bring you this message.  I am so incredibly tired of studying.  Three and a half hours--how is this possible?  I am perfectly ok with Spanish, fairly confident about Psychology, so what is it that I am dreading?  Pre-calculas.  I bet you don't know what else I am tired of.  Well, I'll tell you because this is my place to bitch and complain.  I am tired of people being in a such a fucking good mood.  Yes, that's right, it came straight from my fingers and I don't even care.  I am such a rebel.  Anyway, be in crappy mood once in a while.  Don't be negative all of the time because we all know that it gets old, fast.  All I ask of you is to not be so cheery all of the time, day in and day out, hour after hour after hour.  Be pissed at someone,call a certain librarian not so nice names, make a grown woman cry because she is such an awful spanish teacher, I don't care what you people do just be mean and nasty.  I really get sick of all of the positiveness of the holiday season.  You people have no reason to be happy, yes I know, Jesus-our lord and saviour who died for our sins and the world and human kind was born but, well, I don't know.  You are spending money, hard-earned money, on stuff for people who you don't want to get stuff for and who don't really want your crap.  If you have a good friend or a family member who has been especially nice this year then yes, get them something and show your appreciation but don't if they haven't.  Besides, I read that Jesus' real birthday was in the spring but the Catholic Church was trying to convert pagans to christianity and the end of December just happens to fall on the Winter Solcist, an ancient pagan holiday.  It was supposed to make the transition easier for the pagans.  I apologize because I am not in a very good mood right now but after the stupid semesters I will again blog and hopefully my authoring will be a little more positive.

      Good lord in heaven I hate being sick! I don't get sick very often and when I do, I just pretend that I'm not.  I keep telling myself that I am fine.  I don't have a fever...the thermometer must be wrong.  I just didn't get enough sleep last night.  Then I go into a coughing fit for the next ten minutes.  I feel better today but I still have a fever.  I haven't eaten anything in the last three days except a slice of toast.  I wasn't hungry but my dad shoved the bread down my throat.  The worst part of being sick is missing school.  I really don't like to miss school because I hate making everything up.  I already got my homework for Thursday and Friday and most of it is done.  It is just the idea of missing school that I dont' like.  The other thing that really bothers me about being sick is the germs.  I feel like my house has been infested and I can't get away from the stupid germs that are eating at my flesh.  I am obsessive when it comes to cleanliness when I am in perfect health.  Well, if you can believe it, it gets worse when I am sick.  I don't want anyone else to get sick or for there to be any lingering germs to re-infect me.  Therefore I take precautions.  I wash my hands at least once every hour, usually two or three times.  Of course, I only use paper towels to dry my hands and then I immediately throw them away.  I also carry around a can of Lysol disinfecting spray.  I drench anything I touch: doorknobs, lightswitches, the remote, my calculator, pens, the little twisty thing on the lamp, my keyboard and mouse, the buttons on the trash compactor, the recievers to all of the telephones that I used,  and anything else that dares to look at me.  I was going to spray the pitcher that my orange juice is in but my mom didn't think it would be a good idea to risk drinking Lysol.  I am a little bit bored but for the most part I am just sick of being sick.

      " It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas "  Unfortunately it is January 26 and Christmas is long gone.  Bethany made a very good point in her Christmas blog. Moving on...  I often worry about Belle's comfort.  Her bed is rather lumpy but new beds are really expensive, at least the kind that we want are.  However, with this new snow I am concerned about her going outside without a coat.  So, I got on the internet and found a great coat in her size and it is only $60.  The problem, my parents claim that she doesn't need a coat and they refuse to spend 60 bucks on her.  I think it is most unfair.  She doesn't like to go outside very far.  I also wanted to get her some snow boots or at least shoes to keep her feet dry, but again with the money issue.  She came in yesterday evening and slid across the tile because her feet were wet with the snow.  My parents felt bad so we might get the shoes now, I doubt it.  Next please...  Schools out.  Woohoo, right?  Well not exactly.  I really don't mind school and I really do mind the heat of June.  Oh well, I guess extended weekends are nice.  And last of all...  "Drive safely and arrive alive"  It's a wonderful radio commercial that I heard while driving through the snow last night.  I am not sure why but it just cracked me up.  I thought that they could have come up with something that sounded a little nicer.  Por ejemplo " Drive like a maniac and there is a pretty good chance that you are going to end up in a ditch somewhere bleeding out of your eyesockets"  By the way--for those of you who don't know, Belle is my dog--actually you could call her my bitch. HAHA!

      Overwhelmed...I suppose you could call it that.  Though, it is really more of a tired state.  It seems that living has drained me of what little energy I had.  Sleep just doesn't do what it used to.  I wake up exhausted and ready for the day to be over.  Everyone is dying.  I watch the news and I don't understand how we can live in a world like this.  We aren't phased by death or destruction and I can't imagine how we possibly deal with this shit...and yet we do.  It is the great ability of the human race, to adapt.  We constantly change, for different reasons and in different ways, everyone does.  Unfortunately, it seems that it is rarely for society's benefit.  I sincerely pray that things start to improve, not in my life but in the world.  I do what I can but I guess it isn't enough.  I am tired...physically, mentally, emotionally.  It is someone elses' turn, I can't do it anymore.

      I don't, and never have had any qualms about my father.  However, in the last three days he has been doing something that is frustrating me to no end.  He is ignoring me!  I don't know that ignore is the right word but whatever he is doing is driving me nuts.  I will be talking to my mother and out of nowhere he will just start talking to her about something completely different.  He strikes up a conversation with someone whom I am already speaking to.  I didn't think much about it until tonight.  He was talking to me and just stopped in the middle of a sentence and turned his attention to the television.  I then spent the next fifteen minutes trying to pry the remaining sentence out of him along with the answers to some following questions.  I asked a question three times...THREE TIMES...then, without an answer I turned the tv off and came upstairs.  He just yelled to ask me if I said something.  He is probably thinking about work, that's what it usually is.  I am just feeling frustrated, I know that some people's fathers are significantly worse than mine.

      Happy New Year's everyone!  2004, wow how times flies. The topic of today's blog is probably the same topic of choice for everyone else today: New Year's resolutions.  Do you want to know what my resolution is?  Well, I won't tell you because I don't have a New Year's resolution.  Would you like to know why?  Because New Year's resolutions are for people with no will power.  That's right, lazy people that need an excuse to change something about themselves that they don't like.  If you decide that your resolution is to lose weight, then here's an idea, lose the damn weight.  Don't wait until New Year's so that you can stuff your face and gain twenty pounds during Christmas, start now and do it because your fat!   I'm sorry but why do you have to wait for New Year's?  Recognize the problem and fix it.  Oh, and if you decide to do something, go through with it.  Don't chicken out and give up!

      It's Monday, and it certainly felt like it.   Everyone is seemingly mad at everyone else and I don't know what's going on with any of it.  And in all actuality, I really don't care.  Do what you must.  Yell, scream, beat the living shit out of somebody...just stay out of my way.  My mother and I were talking and I came to the conclusion that I really wouldn't have any problems with being alone.  I mean, no one else on earth, I think I would be just fine.  Unlike most I don't crave the attention, I don't need it nor do I want it.  I am perfectly content spending time in the peace of isolation.  I also decided that I could kill a person if it weren't for the religious implications. I would only be able to kill people that I felt deserved it.  I am not bothered by blood and gore, and I enjoy seeing people that cause others misery, in pain.  If it weren't for hell, half of Taylorville would be dead.  But since the church won't be changing its policy on murder anytime soon, it looks like the world will live another day.

      Religion...  One simple word that can provoke an infinite number of thoughts and feelings.  It is the basis for some of man's most charitable works and his greatest tragedies.  There is so much diversity but if we look closely enough is there really much of a difference between religions?  The Jews have God, Christians have God and Jesus, Muslims have God and Mohammed, Buddhists have their 33 idols...the point is, we all believe in something greater-more powerful than we are.  Someone to praise when things go right and to curse when things go wrong.  A way to explain things that we cannot possibly understand.   The dictionary defines religion as a belief in a supernatural power that is revered as creator and governor of the universe.  It also defines religion as a cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal.  We take it too far, don't deny it for we are all guilty.  We argue, hate, and even kill others over it.  An insult against your religion is personal, as if an insult to your parents.  I have contempt for those who make me question the way I explain the unknown.  Then I turn around an insult another.    We as human beings are simply striving for an explanation.  I would prefer to believe that you will go to heaven, or the next level of being, or whatever and wherever your believe you will go, if you are true to yourself and accept only what you believe.

      Oh, how I despise their existence They don't understand-no they can but choose not to I wonder if anyone would notice... they just disappear never to return, never to be found. Could I do it? probably not, and yet the anger the passion is constantly pushing me The devil on my shoulder, the id whispering so only I can hear Death isn't necessary only peace, only quiet

      Something to quench your thirst...  I have been sealed with the gifts of the Holy Spirit.  Confirmation was tonight and it is definitely an evening that I will remember for the rest of my days.  I don't feel much different than I did before the ceremony, only more nostalgic.  I remember the days when we, as first graders, sang songs in the basement.  When Mrs. Lunk taught our P.S.R. class and gave us joy through her smile.  When Zach decided to eat his entire sunday school book, and accomplished the feat. When Sister Dominica called us "little people" while she looked up at us.  When Bob told us his interesting views on Catholic beliefs.  When Joe threw markers at people, physically attacked Brendan, broke the hands and head off of the Virgin Mary, and referred to womens' chests as "breastisies".  When we actually enjoyed Carole's class because we learned something.  And I remember our days in Erik's class, as we prepared for the Sacrament of Confirmation.  I cannot say that I have enjoyed every minute of my eleven years of P.S.R., but I will never forget them.  Nor will I forget the special bond that I have with the people whom I have spent every Sunday morning since first grade with.

      Very superstitious...very superstitious indeed!  Of course, you all know that I am referring to the song.  Lately, I have been listening to seventies music and I really like it.  It has a good strong beat and almost a jazzy melody; I love jazz.  I have true admiration for Stevie Wonder.  The man is blind and still manages to play a mean piano.  Yeah! Go handicapped people!  Ms. Pedigo was telling us about the summer camp which she volunteers at for a week.  She told us about a fellow counselor who is confined to a wheelchair but decided to go for a dip in the lake last year and took his chair with him.  Needless to say the ELECTRIC wheelchair wasn't waterproof, and it didn't work too well after that little incident.  Ms. Pedigo was talking about trashcan fires in one of her speech classes a few days ago.  There was one in the boy's restroom today.  Mr. Campbell said that it was more of a smoldering than a fire, in his e-mail to the teachers.  In the near future, Science Fair is tomorrow.  It is weird; as much as I dislike Science Fair I am almost looking forward to tomorrow night.  I pray that we will do well, Spencer and I worked really hard on it.  In the distant future, I am going to Europe.  This summer we are going to England, France, and Switzerland.  I am really excited-never been to Europe.  The only downside that I have found is that a certain french teacher's son who is our age but seemingly immature and rather annoying and has the same name as one of my good friends whose last name is Thomas, is going.  Oh well, perhaps he won't be too bad.  The play is quickly approaching.  I have a feeling that the pit will suck...what's new, right?  I have good friends.  A few might be slightly misguided, but good.  Spencer was leading a sing-a-long during lunch in the library.  I will sincerely miss Mrs. Maag when she leaves for back surgery.  I hope that I can deal with Mrs. Wright; I'll just take it day by day.  I made an awesome paper airplane in seventh hour.  The fat bitch from the land of satan stole it, that's right-we all know who I am talking about...it's Bethany!  No, just...um...kidding.  For those of you who don't know---BRITTAN RUDOLPH HEADED TO THE GYNO---yesterday she went because she has been having some nasty cramps.  When she told Gregg she had cramps he asked if they were in her leg!  Yeah Gregg, that's why she is grabbing her crotch, she has a leg cramp.  I asked my neighbor and good family friend to be my sponsor for conformation, he said "Sure, I'd love to!"  One small complication, he is a faithful catholic and is married but didn't get his first marriage annuled.  He talked to father and was told that it would be best if he wasn't my sponsor.  I need a new one!  WHO?  I don't know but I'll figure it out.  I don't have much of a choice.  Wow this has been a long blog.  Well, I could apologize and close up but I'm not going to.  No, I am going to explain the meaning of life.  First of all, the meaning of life is supposed to be some big huge unanswerable question.  Newsflash people, LIFE is a word-that means that is a definition a.k.a. meaning.  The following are the meanings of life: 1. existence in the physical world: the quality that makes living animals and plants different from dead organisms and inorganic matter. Its functions include the ability to take in food, adapt to the environment, grow, and reproduce.  2. living individual: a living being, especially a person, often used when referring to the number of people killed in an accident or a war ( usually used in the plural )  Two hundred lives were lost in the crash. 3. living things considered together: a group of living things, usually of a particular kind She was an expert on plant life in the Amazon. 4. whole time somebody is alive: the entire period during which somebody is, has been, or will yet be alive All my life I?ve wanted to learn to fly. 5. time when something functions: the period during which something continues to function Cheap batteries usually have short lives. 6. some part of somebody?s life: a particular aspect of somebody?s life social life.  7. human activity: human existence or activity in general real life.  8. life imprisonment: life imprisonment ( informal )  9. way in which somebody lives: the character or conditions of an individual?s existence Most people in this city lead hard lives. 10. characteristic way of living: a way of living that is characteristic of a particular place or group country life.  11. biography: an account of a somebody?s life, usually in writing, but sometimes in other media such as film, video, or radio He was the author of ?The Life of Galileo.? 12. vitality: animation and vitality, or something that produces animation or vitality We liked him because he was so full of life.  13. artist?s subject: something real used as a subject by an artist, especially human models, who are often nude She always insisted on painting from life.  From the previous reading I have come to two conclusions.  The first is that people should not ask "What is the meaning of life?"  but rather "What is the purpose of my life?".  The second is that I have absolutely no idea what I am talking about and if you have read this entire entry you are almost as pathetic as myself.  If you skimmed through the definitions I can't say that I blame you, but I can say you are a dirty lying son-of-a-bitch.    Have a nice day!

      Nibblin' on sponge cake...watching the sun bake...all of those tourists covered in oil  Jimmy Buffet always makes me think of two things--margaritas and scuba diving.  Needless to say, I am in the mood for diving.  His songs remind me of those warm, summer days spent in the Florida Keys.  Nothing to do but don some scuba gear and head toward the reefs.  It has been just under a year since I have been diving and with warm days upon us I am longing for the open ocean.  Diving is such an incredibly unique experience; it is almost indescribable.  One of the few activities that can both get your blood pumping and totally relax you at the same time.  Just imagine...you are completely weightless-able to move in any manner you want, you can't hear anything but the calming sounds of the ocean-a dull whisper, surrounded by the most fascinating life, and most of all you are breathing underwater. I want, no, I need to dive and be immersed in another world right here on planet Earth.     "From birth, man carries the weight of gravity on his shoulders.  He is bolted to earth.  But man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free." ---Jacques Cousteau

      Oh my dearest, how I have missed you so...                                                          That's right...it is that time of the year for camping!  I didn't realize how anxious I was to get out of the house and sleep under the stars until last night.  We camped, we cooked steaks, we burned half a truckload of band music (what do you expect...I was with David), we went four-wheeling, cleared a new and improved campsite, and discovered a den of baby coyotes.  It was an interesting evening to say the least.  When we realized that there was a coyote den a few hundred yards from our camp we got a little nervous.  That nervousness increased dramatically when we discovered that David's dog, Shadow, had decided to bring one of the baby coyotes into our camp and play with it.  We took it back, made our fire a hell of a lot bigger, and made some fire-hardened clubs.  Exciting shit, I tell you.  I came home covered in mud, stinking like smoke, cut up by thorns, and the happiest that I have been in months.

      "I'm in it for the music"...                                                                      I love it! We have all heard famous people claim that they make music because it makes them happy. They just want other people to experience what makes them feel good, as long as they pay fifteen bucks for ten songs-one of which they want. I am one of those people that envelopes themselves in music to find pleasure. However, I am not going to spend money on music. It may be illegal; I can understand why. I won't stop!

      Where has all the positivity gone?                                                         First of all, I know that positivity is not a word. That aside, I think I made my point. Well, maybe not...I shall explain.  I have been rather negative this week.  There is really no particular reason, just in one of those moods.  Everybody has them, moods that is, at least I think they do. Anyhoo, I am sick of it.  Some people tend to be negative all the time and it gets old.  I don't want to be one of those people.  Besides, I don't have any reason to be negative. I have a roof over my head, a loving family, and a full stomach.  I was complaining earlier today that I didn't know what I wanted for my birthday. I was bitching because I have everything that I want and can't think of anything else...unbelievable. Am I really so pathetic that I can't be happy with what I do have. It almost made me sick when I realized what I was doing. There are people in this world that can't even afford to eat-what was I thinking. I should have been knocked upside the head. I need to stop being so damned negative, and be grateful. Good LORD! I am alive, that should be enough. I needed a vent.  For greed all nature is too little.      -Lucius Annaeus Seneca

      A new beginning...                                                                                 It has been roughly a year and three months since I started blogging, and a change felt right.  I won't forget those crazy old blogs...but I will hopefully create some new ones worth remembering. What the hell and I talking about? It's a gosh-darned blog not my life. Sorry, I was having a weird nostalgic minute. Somebody needs to get me help. Anyway, lots of changes going on, some for the better and some for the worse. But hey, that's life.   It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure on the world.                   --John Steinbeck

      Help me!!!                                                                                                        I just realized how weird I am.  Earlier, at about two o'clock, my mom asked me to clean my shower.  So I cleaned the shower, and then I cleaned the sink, and the toliet, and the mirrors, and the floor.  Then, I moved to my room where I took all the sheets off of my bed.  I then re-made my bed, swiffered my entire room, cleaned my computer, and then I took everything out of my drawers.  I re-organized all of my drawers, and then I moved to my closet.  I vacuummed and I had nothing else to clean in my room.  I moved to my sister's room and I cleaned her shower for her because she didn't want to.  I just finished.  Sitting and thinking about if there was anything else that I could clean, it occured to me how strange I am.  Who cleans like that? Nobody--at least nobody that is normal.  I think that I might need professional help.

      Don't mind the blood                                                                                       My sister is really pissing me off. Not the slam the door in her face-light her clothes on fire kind of pissed, the "I'm tired and I really don't give a darn" kind of pissed. I know nobody out there cares but if you have a spare meat cleaver lying around...well, you know my number.   This will probably be the final blog for the next two weeks due to my absense from the country, so I am going to do my best to give you some things to think about while I am gone. Here we go:  1. I am going to be having a blast in England, France, and Switzerland while you are stuck in sunny Taylorville. I'm done; I just had to rub it in a little.  2. Someone needs to devise a plan for the eradication of a bird nest outside my window. I yell at the birds regularly but it doesn't seem to do any good. And since it is spring there are going to be some baby birdies chirping soon enough...at least somebody got some action.  3. Someone needs to devise a plan for the eradication of all stupid people that are everywhere. I yell at them regularly but it doesn't seem to do any good. And since most of them mate like wild rabbits there are going to be even more stupid people...to star in action films.  4. Don't ask me what the action films thing was about, I really don't know.  5. Elevators are really a lot of fun, unless someone farts while you are on it.  6. It is really a lot of fun to fart on elevators and watch people squirm.   7. Antiperspirant has mercury in it. That's right, the stuff they tell you to be careful with and don't touch-it's in the stuff that your underarms are absorbing. It is also linked to alzheimer's disease. I'm not saying that you should go around stinking, just use deodorant-not antiperspirant.   8. I really don't like it when people are in my house and they don't acknowledge me, simply because I'm not a person that they would normally talk to. You're in MY HOME! At least say hi and don't be an asshole.  9. I have nothing more to say...for now.

      I do not negotiate with terrorists                                                                      Well, Brittan isn't exactly a terrorist, but that is not the point. I am not blogging for her, I almost regret that I have to blog-her poems are really quite humorous.  Where was I...oh yes. I had a wonderful birthday yesterday. I recieved some very nice gifts from my family and friends(oh wait, the only friends that got me anything were Val and Megan J.) The rest of you are going to burn for not indulging my greedy side, after all, it only surfaces twice a year! Onto the food "charge!". I had a really great birthday supper. We had filets, grilled peppers, salad, macaroni and cheese, Hawaiian sweet rolls, salad, asparagus(I don't like asapargus, it makes your pee smell funny), these onion things that my dad grills in which he puts garlic and butter, and texas sheet cake. My mouth is watering... I started work today. Again it is for the Secretary of State, but this year I don't have to process license plates. In fact, I don't have to do anything with license plates(this alone is cause for celebration)! I now work in the Department of Accounting and Revenue, Bureau of Department of Motor Vehicles Auditing. That's right...I get to audit the state, this means I do math all day long. I am enjoying it, air conditioning, a smoke-free building, and a state office, it can't get much better than that! The state office part refers to the laziness/ingenuity of state workers. Our office's clock is ten minutes fast, the logical person would simply set it back so we were on time with everyone else. But they are really thinkers in that office, since we are ten minutes ahead of everyone else we do everything ten minutes before anyone else gets to do it. The break rooms are empty-and the machines are still fully stocked, there are no lines to go the bathroom, we beat the lunch crowd to all the restaurants, the parking lot is a cinch to get out of, and the best part is that we get out of work ten minutes before every other state worker in the city-no rush hour traffic! The singular downside is that we have to start work ten minutes early so that no one gets in trouble, I don't care-I'm a morning person!  I want to again congratulate all of the seniors(especially Val)on graduation! By the way, in reference to the present comment earlier I was just joking. I don't expect anything from any of you and I know that I am a greedy little bastard!  Have a great morning/afternoon/evening!

      Does it feel like summer?                                                                                      Sure it does! School is out, the weather is beautiful, and the ice-cream truck is up and running. You can't get much more summery than that. It has been a long year and I am completely ready for summer, because it means LOTS of FUN!  On a slightly less positive note, time is passing faster than I want it to. I think that everyone is coming to the realization that next year is our last in high school. It is really rather scary. I know that people say that they can't wait to get out of high school, but I think I could stand another couple of years. I don't deal well with change. I can't imagine what the seniors are going through, a combination of incredible joy and incredible fear perhaps? Bethany really needs to get that time machine/energy converter thing built. Or maybe I will just go to space. Though, I will probably just deal with the changes as they come.  Men do change, adn change comes like a little wind that ruffles the curtains at dawn, and it comes like the stealthy perfume of wildflowers hidden in the grass--John Steinbeck

      Back to the future...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Who&nbsp;in there right mind&nbsp;would want to go back to the future? As far as I can tell, the future is a very scary thing or place, time, whatever the hell it is. I recieved a rather loud wake up call today, actually it was more like being woken up by a 1,000 piece trumpet ensemble. We are old.   I took my first steps into the rest of my life today. The college applications have begun. I am going to apply Early-admission at University of Chicago but not at Wash U. I am not applying early at Washington because they are binding; you get accepted and you are attending. I am a little confused about how it can be legally binding but I suppose that since I don't have a law degree&nbsp;I don't know much about&nbsp;the law. I don't know where I want to go, or how on God's green earth I am going to pay for it...I'll worry about it later. I'm scared,&nbsp;&nbsp;and I still have a year left in Taylorville. I am going to visit SLU in a few weeks and we shall see how that goes. I suppose that I shouldn't be&nbsp;so worried, but I am comfortable here with my friends and the town that I know...I don't want to come out from under my security blanket.&nbsp;I know that there is&nbsp;going to come a time when I must throw caution to the wind and let life take me away, but&nbsp;I am not ready yet, I don't&nbsp;think I will ever be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "The secret&nbsp;of health for both mind and body is&nbsp;not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly."--Buddha&nbsp;

      Amen...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The wedding was an enjoyable experience.&nbsp; For those of you who droned me out while I was telling you, my cousin, Craig Coady, married the lovely Darcy McCracken (she's scottish). I do believe that it was my first time at a protestant wedding and I found it very interesting. I was amused several times when the minister would be interuppted during the exchange of vows by shouts of "AMEN!". I was also slightly embarrased when everyone stood to sing and my family,&nbsp;who occupied the first two rows, where the only people that I could see who weren't singing. Though, I suppose there were a few other catholics there who weren't singing either. The music was really awesome. As we entered the church we were greeted by a bagpipe player-again with the scottish thing. A violin, cello, and piano played some pretty little ditties before the wedding. The bride entered the church to the sound of a trumpet. The songs that we didn't sing were accompanied by a guitar and a bongo drum. The bride and groom entered the reception following the bagpipe player again. And lastly the background music for the reception was light jazz by a piano player and a trumpet. As I said, the music was awesome.   The first thing we did when we got to Chicago was to take my grandparents to the church. I saw my cousins who were also two of the eleven bridesmaids and were hungry. We got food and returned to the church. I couldn't find them but I had seen them go up some steps and through a door so I thought they might be up there somewhere. I went up the steps and through to door only to be stopped by a very pregnant woman asking me what I was doing. I told her and she told me that I couldn't come in because it was the brides dressing room. She took the food-I hope she gave it to Maureen and Andrea.   The reception was unique. For a catholic marriage, a reception is more than just a place where you meet the bride and groom. It is a place where you get piss-ass drunk, dance, and just generally party until the wee hours. (My last cousin's reception ended at about six in the morning) Apparently that isn't what they do at all protestant receptions. There wasn't any alcohol, they don't believe in drinking, there wasn't any dancing, I don't know if they don't believe in dancing or what. The time instead was occupied by speeches: one from each of the maids of honor(making two), one from each of the best men(making three), one from two of the brides uncles(making two), two from one other uncle(making two), one from the father of the bride(making one), one from the bride and groom themselves(making one)--a total of eleven speeches. Then there was an enjoyable movie and the reception was over. It also ended at about six, but it was six in the evening.   As I said, it was a unique and interesting experience, but still a very enjoyable time. Congratulations to the two of them.   (My cousin, Danny Fahl, and I were being a bit ornery and we signed the guest book, well actually these little cards that will be put in the guest book, "To our cousin Craig...Good luck tonight!&nbsp; Danny and Andy") Our parents found it very amusing, Craig will find it amusing, but I'm not sure how the bride will take it.

Instead of your typical, obnoxious, blaring bell is started with a light show, sort of.  &nbsp; I am sitting a my desk enjoying the cahoots of Bob and Tom and at exactly 8:23 I notice a subtle blinking of white lights. I look up as everyone in my office is standing and gathering their things. "BLoop, BLoop" says the alarm. I can't help but wonder what is going on but the blooping is immediately followed by an explanation. Out of the flashy light comes&nbsp;a computerized,&nbsp;all-business kind of voice: "Attention, an alarm has been activated in the building. All personel are to follow their emergency response coordinators to the nearest exit. Stairwells should be used to exit the building. Elevators should not be used for evacuation purposes other than by handicapped personel...BLoop,BLoop". So what do you think happened? Fat and lazy people rushed to be the first ones on the elevator, the entire sixth floor crammed into the freight elevators, and people like me walked down the five flights of stairs at a pace where we surely would have died from smoke asfixiation&nbsp;if&nbsp;it had been a real fire.&nbsp; &nbsp; After about 15 minutes were are cleared to go back inside. I climb to the fourth floor because the elevators&nbsp;are locked out and then I hear a strangely familiar "BLoop,BLoop". I walk&nbsp;back&nbsp;outside and pop a squat underneath a tree. They clear us to go in but I have learned&nbsp;my lesson. I continue sitting outside for another 20 minutes in case the alarm goes off again. It doesn't and those of us that&nbsp;are left mosy on in. I take another 15 minutes getting to my office making a stop&nbsp;on every floor. When I arrive,&nbsp;my co-workers and I are given a fifteen minute speech on the consequences of not following&nbsp;emergency procedures and are reminded that&nbsp;we are still on the clock when there is a&nbsp;fire, it shouldn't take anyone more than 15 minutes to return once the building has been cleared...oh damn, was that one directed at me? I return to my work and take my usual&nbsp;morning break&nbsp;9 minutes later.  &nbsp; The worst part of the whole shabang was that there wasn't even a fire, just a short in&nbsp;the system. &nbsp; "BLoop,BLoop"--Howelett Building Fire&nbsp;Alarm&nbsp;

      Workin at the carwash...                                                                                           That was nothing but a blatant lie, I don't work at the carwash. However, I did recently go to the carwash. As you may have already guessed...I washed my car. For the first time in eleven and a half months, and only the second time during its life with me, my car got a thorough cleaning. It was interesting, a good experience if nothing else. The rainbow shine smells of sweet bubble gum!  I went to Wal-mart yesterday to buy a radio. I needed one, seeing as how I have been incredibly bored at work recently. It isn't that I have nothing to do. The work is simply mindless but I can't complain, full-time at seven bucks an hour brings in some serious cash. Anyway, I was really bored yesterday so I started plotting to kill my co-workers. One-by-one I thought about how I could lure them into a secluded area and what the best way to kill them would be. Suffocation, stabbing with the scissors, stabbing with the letter opener, stabbing with the pen, shooting the electric stapler at them, binding them with calculator tape, throwing them down an elevator shaft, poisoning the food in the cafeteria, pushing them down the stairs, running them over as they crossed the street, throwing them out a window, but then I realized that I don't have to kill them because they will probably die from boredom within the next few weeks anyway. Besides my co-workers are nice people whom I wouldn't want to kill unless they managed to really piss me off, which doesn't happen very often. I can't believe that I am actually plotting their deaths, I suspect I could never kill a person even if I wanted to-I have too much respect for life in general. So that is why I bought a radio. And then Spencer and I were arguing about whether or not pifle is a word. He kept saying "pifle this and pifle that", it was pissing me off because I was sure that pifle wasn't a word. I was wrong, pifle is a synonym for rubbish or tom-foolery. That is absolute pifle.   "This whole blog is nothing but bloody pifle" --Andy Mitchelson

      I'll be back...                                                                                                   Well, actualy I already am. Blimey I'm nacard! That means that I am tired...dog tired. Although there were a few glitches, the trip was a success for the most part. I had a very enjoyable time, got really sick of certain people...though not the ones that I had expected to get sick of, and got plain ole sick. The flights were long and there were some problems, but nobody died...which isn't necessarily a good thing. By the end of the trip I had memorized the pre-flight speech--"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard flight ### nonstop service to (insert destination). Our estimated flying time is (insert number) hours. We ask you to look forward and pay attention to the flight attendants for flight instructions. Once again we hope you have an enjoyable flight and thank you for flying Delta". This was followed by an ignorant movie accompanied by hand-gesturing flight attendants. I think I actually laughed aloud every time that they show us how to put on the life preservers. In the unlikely event that the plane crashes into the middle of the ocean I sincerly doubt that we are all going to be as calm, and intact, as the people in the movie putting on their life jackets. If the plane loses power there is emergency lighting to show us to the exits...then what? Are we going to jump out of the freaking plane while it is 40,000 feet above the Atlantic? Hell no! The emergency lighting should direct us to the galley so that we can get piss-ass drunk before the plane depressurizes and literally disinegrates our lungs! And my favorite is the oxygen masks. If the plane experiences a loss in cabin pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the ceiling. You should put yours on before helping the people around you. The movie actually shows a mother calmly putting on her oxygen mask while her son sits idly by apperently not able to breathe. Then she helps him! What the hell is this? If the cabin experiences a loss in cabin pressure it means there is a hole in the plane. The oxygen is gone because a vaccuum is created within the airplane. Guess what that means people...the oxygen isn't the only thing that is being sucked out of the plane, bye-bye apendages! Good lord, that safety crap is a joke...just sit back and enjoy the flight. Skip to the very end of the trip and...  I, or should I say we, are sick because of pure stupidity. On the last day of our trip we wandered down the mountains in Switzerland to a nice little river. It is stream fed from the mountains and is the cleanest, and coldest, water I have ever seen. Everybody drinks it with no ill-effects. Anyway, some of us thought it would be fun to take off our shoes and wade through the water. That's right...we were barefoot in, literally, ice-cold water. It numbed your feet in about thirty seconds. However, I did have fun so I suppose it was worth it!

      I work in a loony bin...                                                                                     I don't want to talk about my place of employment too much, but I can't let this one slip by. I thought that there were some crazy people in my office(and there are) but the people across the hall should be institutionalized.  First, a little background information. We'll start with Elise--female, black, 20's, entertaining, rather jumpy. Then there is B.J.--male, black, 20's, quiet, 6'3'', dating Elise. Next is Laura--female, white, 40's-50's, LOUD, talks too much. Then comes Carol "C.T." Turner--female, white, 60's, hilarious, curses often. Now there is Dave--male, beyond that I know nothing. Finally there is Shelley--female, white, 50's, nicknamed Chewy(Chewbaca), full-fledged nuts. The office across the hall doesn't have any computers because Shelley crashed the entire network...twice. She is mean to everyone, especially student workers. She tries to convince people that random men are in love with her, they aren't. She eavesdrops with the best of them and can retain, and relay, gossip for years. She clings to people that are nice to her...so much so that she has numerous restraining orders against her because she has followed people to their homes. As I said, she is full-fledged nuts. And so the story begins...  Around 1:30 or so in the afternoon Elise and B.J. are fighting as usual. Evidently Shelley chimed in with a remark or something because B.J. told her to shut-up. It was really none of her business. His comment was followed by Shelley slapping him as hard as she could across the face. Elise freaks out, calls Shelley some names, and calls the police. B.J. is going to press charges. (You can't just attack your co-workers!) An hour or so later Shelley is escorted from the building in handcuffs. This much drama is enough to keep the entire building flowing with gossip for weeks, but there is more. About twenty minutes after Shelley leaves the building, I went to the bathroom. I saw Laura in the hall and she gave me a brief synopsis of what happened following by some nasty comments about Elise and B.J. I returned to work, but Laura did not. She went into the breakroom and started talking, LOUDLY, to Dave about Elise. Elise overheard her and a vicious battle of words ensued. So loud that people came from both sides of the building to find out what was happening. Elise and Laura parted ways, leaving C.T. and Dave in the breakroom. The onlookers began to crowd the breakroom trying to figure out what happened. C.T. told them to get the hell out and go back to work because it was none of their damn business.  This is coming from a woman who if you just looked at her you are reminded of the ideal grandmother.  Anyway, there was lots of goings on and it made for a very entertaining Monday. State workers are the best!  "Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule."--Friedrich Nietzsche
