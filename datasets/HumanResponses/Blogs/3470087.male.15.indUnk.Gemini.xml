      Thoughts on the world 30/5/04:  1) Why Far Cry is obviously the best game out at the mo and refuses to work on my computer, while my mate's handles it fine. 2) Why the song I just finished listening to was called 'Women Tied  up in Knots'...? ... (one of the 100 songs) 3) Why Thief 3 won't work on Windows 98 but only on XP... Grr... 4) What to write next. 5) Why this.  A'thank you and goodnight.

      First off: I'm not black. Second: I like black music.  Hmm...?  The song 'All Falls Down' by Kanye West is now on its second repeat.   His voice is looping in my head,    "She couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis/Hair so long that it looked like weave then she cut it all off now she look like Eve"   Not particularly clever lyrics, but a fucking catchy tune.  Syleena Johnson's repition of simple line reverberates around my mind.  I'm not the only one who likes it.  Since hearing it about a month and a half ago I've introduced it to a mate of mine, a committed Guns N' Roses fan.  He sings it while he plays football.  In West's own words:  "Now, tell me that ain't insecure"   Catchy.  Listen.   Also download the file on this:  urlLink 100 short songs   Opened my eyes to loads of different music, not all of which I like but, hell, most of them are only a minute long so its hardly a problem.  And I've decided: I want to listen to all types of music and enjoy them for what they are.  I'm going to borrow some CDs from my mates (GN'R fan included) and listen to them all: be it London's underground hip-hop scene/ The Darkness or, in fact, whatever I can get my grubby mitts on.  And I'm going to try to like them all.  And that means even though I'm white, I can enjoy black music.   "It seems we be living the American dream, the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem/The prettiest people do the ugliset things for the road to riches and diamond rings.   Listen to it.  Even if you think you won't like it.

      I've been having a bit of a break.  And yes, it's because I changed to XP, got rid of all my internet history and forgot my password... Oops...  Anyway, normal service will be resumed shortly.

      French Listening today.  In fact, it went a whole lot better than I thought it would.  The first section was very easy and the English bit at the end wasn't particularly tricky either.  The only really difficult bit was the end of the French section which I just heard none of.  Ah well eh?

      Exams...  Well, I've already done the unimportant ones (the school ones) but my clever ole school decides that a selection of Year 10s does Maths and French early.  -Bit of background: My first school was a little local school called Little Reddings.  I'm 14 now and I still see two of my old friends regularly.  However, (this sounds soooo arrogant...) I was a fair bit cleverer than most people there (ouch.) and my teachers and parents noticed this.  My parents have always wanted the best for me (sometimes almost overly so in my opinion) and they gave me a personal tutor.  Now I go to private school called Merchant Taylors' in Northwood (NW London).-  Anyway, today was Maths non-calc paper.  Two hours in the heat...  Uuurghh...  Easy as pie.  (There's that arrogance again...)  French tomorrow.  Not my best subject - in fact my worst.  What's the worst that can happen?

      Thought of the day: Listening to easy, sing-along songs is a bad idea when attempting GCSE Biology coursework. As is blogging.  Meh...  In other news, today is the 60th anniversairy of the D-Day landings.

      MP3 downloading.  It seems that in a world of broadband and unrestricted access to a network which is uncontrollable and utterly vast: the World Wide Web (say it in the '1996 OMFG a computer!!1!' way), that the music industry will always from now on into the future be subjected to the illegal downloading of music files: MP3s.  In fact the music that I'm listening to at the moment is 'acquired'.  CD sales have been in decline for quite a while now so should we care?  'Acquiring' music doesn't hurt anyone does it?  They're rich enough without us paying for their overpriced shiny discs.  Aren't they?  At the end of the day, the music industry is incapable of stopping this new wave of P2P sharing. CD protection is there to be broken by hackers - in fact anyone with access to  urlLink Dodgysitewhichdoesnotactuallyexist  can copy their CD files and spread them on the vast plains of the intraweb.  The main problem for the industry is the sheer size of the internet.  The information stored online simply could not be stored as ink on paper.  It would fill up the world's warehouses ten times over. Cleaning up the internet is simply impossible, but even more difficult to get to grips with is the rise of P2P sharing netowrks.  Since Napster stopped their 'illegal' (in 's because it  is  an unclear issue)  downloading in July 2001, many others have filled the void.  Of course, Kazaa is the most prominent but there are many pretenders to throne: WinMX, Ares, Limewire for examples.  However, the music business cannot even kill off people downloading programs like Kazaa not only because of the enormity of the internet community (most home computers in the UK will probably have a shared folder: full of MP3s ready to be shared across the world) but also because of the legal framweork.  The programs themselves (Kazaa etc.) are not illegal, they are legal programs which allow file sharing.  It is the actual file sharing which is illegal.  This means that the user can be prosecuted but the program allowing the act is legal.    Similar to gun laws anyone? Having guns are fine oh yeah, but shoot it... You did it, and the fact that the gun was openly available to you has  absolutely nothing to do with it .  There is a but.  The thing is: P2P sharing is  still  in its infancy.  The music business will continue to produce CDs and people will continue to buy them... that is, until the internet evolves again.  When broadband finally reaches everyone, when broadband is made obsolete - then the industry will be in trouble.  To the head honchos of all music businesses: enjoy your green while you're still making it.  -dave, at 30k/s

      So why the fuck is my school the  only  school in the UK seemingly who go back to school on Thursday and Friday of half-term week?!  Anyway, just had a six day weekend (meh, good enough I s'pose) and got some good exam results just back. So that's okay.      So. Big Brother 5.  I've never watched any of the previous ones in any serious way, something to watch while channel hopping.  But I watched about ten minutes last night and fucking hell who are the people that they've put in this year?  A blond Scot who thinks showing his arse on public TV is funny, a bald wannabe Brian whose 'thing' in the diary room just forced me to turn it off, Kitten (just wtf?).  Ooo and this time it's evil... We're going to kick someone out for... erm... bit of publicity.  Oh that's fine then.  I think that's it's sad that BB can so easily capture the public's imagination and interest and it is a good reflection of our obsession with attention-seeking, celebrity-worship and overall lack of sense of the important issues in the world today.   It speaks volumes that most newspapers will tomorrow be concerned with the shenagins revolving round in the BB house at the same time as one of our main energy sources, oil, is in a state of disarray.

      With all the BBC coverage of the 60th anniversairy of D-Day, I've been thinking about the actual event and my knowledge of it.  Frankly, it expands to two forms of media: 1) Film: Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers (superior IMO) and 2) Games: Medal of Hono(u)r and Call of Duty. Hmm...  Hardly an expert am I?   urlLink The BBC website for D-Day  (well, that will give you a start if you know as little as me.  However, it has got me thinking.  We celebrate the events of 6th June 1944 as entertainment, as the spectator of 'heroes' in the form of film (although this is more morally 'viable' in BoB as that was a true story) and as the hero ourselves in the form of videogames.  In fact, in the 21st century, we observe the worst six years in the 20th century as entertainment: something to enjoy.  Hmm?  Something to think about next time you charge up Omaha beach or watch *that* opening to a certain popular film starring Tom Hanks.    In other news today, the government of Iraq has been sworn in.  Hate to be cynical but in a country so long dominated by dictatorship, and now torn up by invasion and terrorism, how long will it last...

      Well, I've finished my Writing entry.  And yes, even I'm ashamed to see how utter crap it is.  Ah well...              Intensity                               He was trapped, trapped in a time and place that he’d never known before.    Confined in a cube for eternity.    The walls were pure white, blank and clinical like a hospital ward.                   The terminal ward.                   There was no light, but he could see clearly.    But all he could see was white.    His eyes yearned for colour.    The white was clean and sharp, burning his retinas like fire.    There was no movement – emptiness.    Where was he?    Where had he been?    Who was he?    The questions seemed unanswerable, balls of string, endlessly unwinding – but there was no end.       He tried to blank it all out, escape the pain.    Except he couldn’t close his eyes.    What should have been boredom was agony.    Torture.    He longed for closure and escapism.    But all he could see were white walls, burning white walls.                               Impact.           A sudden force slammed into him, locking his bones, smashing them together with horrific power.    He felt himself thrown against it, two forces colliding like stone titans.    And fire rip through his chest, his being -the coals stoking the furnace, flames clawing, scraping, tearing, ravaging, savaging the very fibre of his body.                         And still.                               Waiting.                               Waiting.                               Waiting.                               Still waiting.    And aching.                     He was still held in the middle of the cube, suspended by the merciless bounds of empty space.    He couldn’t feel his presence yet he knew he was there, endlessly caught, like being frozen in time.    But his legs had begun to ache.    If his legs were even there at all.                     But even if they weren’t – they still ached.                     And so did his arms.                     They ached too.                     He felt as if they were being stretched.    Maybe pulled out on a rack, a monotonous crank forever clicking and dragging his limbs in four different directions, inch by inch, centimetre by centimetre.    This was torture.    But it wasn’t that kind of torture.    Here, there was everything and nothing.    Pain and no cause. Endless searing agony but he didn’t even know if his body was there with him.                     Maybe he was being crucified and he was delirious from dehydration in the heat of the sun.    Maybe sometime soon he was going to die and be relieved of this nothingness.    Maybe vultures would come to peck out his eyes and feast on his entrails.    Maybe it would hurt, but no more than what he was experiencing already.    Maybe little children would come and throw stones and glass and the glass would get stuck in the soles of his feet and the palms of his hands and his feet and his hands would bleed and the blood would run down his arms and the glare of the sun would intensify through the blood and the glare roast his skin as blood trickled and then, maybe, just maybe, he would die.    He wanted to die.    Why wouldn’t he die?    Why couldn’t he die?                     Was he dead?                               An epic thud.    A cacophony of scraping and vicious bending, clawing and mutilated screeches ripped through his ears.    Roaring through the narrow passages hitting, pounding his eardrums.    Violent electronic nerve messages, angry, hungry – scratching, biting, ripping, tearing and all was quiet apart from the slow, mournful hiss of defeat.                               If colours had sounds then the white was empty, silent and razor-sharp.    He couldn’t hear himself breathing or a faint heartbeat.    The cube cell, his prison cell, was empty and vacuous.    No sound, no light – silence and glaring white.    Even the silence tormented him.    His ears wanted to stretch and pick up any sound, any distant vibration, anything.    The emptiness hurt him.    He felt unable to keep himself still, if he still had muscles they itched.    But it was not even as if he was locked in a state of immobility.    He just was there.    But wasn’t.    And he was frightened.                   How long now?                   How long had it been?    Memory is a fickle mistress.    Here one moment and gone the next.    It could have been seconds or years or hundreds or thousands but he only knew the present, no memory of the past and no hope for the future.    Only a frustration, hatred, torment at his present.                   Identity.    He had none.    His existence was futile; his resistance to his existence was more so.    He didn’t know who he was, he wasn’t anybody.    He was just here, suspended, tortured, devoid of life, devoid of emotion, he was a shell.    A shell to be beaten and pounded and hit and destroyed until it couldn’t take it anymore.                   And he couldn’t take it anymore.                   But he couldn’t do anything.                   He was powerless, alone.    He could do nothing.    He wanted to curl up and hold himself, be held.    He wanted to escape the intense white light and close his eyes.    He wanted to be able to cry out and moan and let out his pain.    He wanted to feel hot tears running down his cheeks and be able to hold his head in his hands and leave this place.                     The white light intensified.    Purity was made more pure.    His limbs were stretched further.    Coal was thrown to the furnaces, the fires heating and spitting their vehement anger more violently.    The silence was drained of sound.    The intensity boiled and tore at his damaged soul.                   And he screamed.                                           Shapes…                   Sounds…                   Lights…                   A person…    And another one…                   Noises…                   “He’s awake.”                   “You’ve been in a car crash.    You’ve been in a coma.    Welcome back.”                   Memory is a fickle mistress.    She comes and goes when she pleases.    She went.      Don't laugh.  Please.

       urlLink Prey's World Forums   This is probably where you'll find me.  'salt and pepper'  Anyway, this isn't about the forum as such (although there's a lot to its history - maybe some other time)but about a competition that's running between forumites at the moment.  The competition is one of writing.  You have to write an opening to a story which introduces the characters, hints at a plot blah blah blah...  The whole thing sprang out of this guy's head because he heard that 'videogames kill your imagination (and we are scared of technology so read books and lots of them*).  So what to write?  It's easy to say that my imagination is alive and kicking but to tell you the truth I haven't had many ideas since entering.  Original ideas that is.  So do videogames kill your imagination?  I reckon no.  And by the time the competition has ended (three weeks from now I think) there will be a bone fide original opening to a story here, on this blog  Now there's a challenge for the Summer holidays...    *Possibly not true.

      Bloody hell, been a while hasn't it?  Sorry if anyone's actually reading this...  Anyways, while I've been away, its been my birthday, finished off those two GCSEs and am still doing bloody coursework :x.  (Miss emoticons :( )  No problem over here though as from this Thursday, I'm off school. Hooray.  We haven't got a holiday planned or anything so I'm not sure if we're going away or not but I feel absolutely knackered after this year (been a long one) so I'll be glad of a rest.  And I should be getting an mp3 player some time soon if I can get my parents to buy it:  urlLink Creative Zen Xtra 30Gb   £218 sounds monstrously big though... Dad...  Went to see Shrek 2 yesterday with a couple of mates.  To be honest, I loved it.  It was really funny with lots of little digs at Hollywood and culture (giant Gingerbread Man destroys a Starbucks' cafe, everyone runs out... and enters the Starbucks' across the road) and all the references to fairy tales et al:  "Pinochio, tell a lie" "Like what?" "Like you're wearing womens' underwear" "I'm wearing womens' underwear." [Nothing] "You aren't really wearing womens' underwear are you?" "No, of course not" [Nose grows] "Are too." "Am not." [Nose grows] "Are too." "Am not." [Nose grows] "Are too. What kind." Inspects. "It's a thong!"  And one word: the cat.  (oh, that's two.  :s)  Anyway, go see if you haven't already.   I bid you goodnight.

      OK, I think we have some catching up to do, don't we?  Thursday:  Meets Aaron (best friend of long time).  Goes town.  Buys odd little game called Beyond Good and Evil.  Aaron calls it 'little alien game'.  Meh.  I think.  Other people like it anyway.  Spot bufftings and ogle asses.  Absent-mindedly walk into Smiths.  Aaron picks up Raven Shield.  £15 - not bad.  We both quite liked the demo.  Go to till.  Nice shop assisstant (ie. also verah sexah ie. not a chance in the world ie. longing material ie. MM, and no, I'm not telling you what MM stands for, if you have a dirrrrty mind you can work it out):  "Hmm... it's been reduced.  £1.99 please."  Aaron and I (not 'me and Aaron' - oh no.  Mum is very picky about my grammar ¬_¬) try to contain snorts of incredulousness (is that a word??).  He hands over two pounds.  "For £1.99.  Fucking hell.  £1.99!!  Fucking hell"  (That's me) "You can't stop saying that can you?"  (That's Aaron)  Go back to my place and waste hours away going through the game's missions.  Great fun.  And for only two quid!!  Fucking hell!!  Aaron goes.  I install Beyond Good and Evil.  I am blown away.  This game is possibly the freshest, oddest, funniest, most clever platformer I've ever played.  You control Jade, a freelance photographer on the planet Hillys who with her Uncle Pey'J (an obese pig mechanic - one of the most endearing characters in any game ever) must stop the invasion of her planet by the Domz, ugly aliens naturally, and at the same time uncover a conspiracy that threatens her people's safety.  You must play this game.  You must also listen to  Johnny Boy - You Are The Generation That Bought More Shoes & You Get What You Deserve   Trust me.  It's only been on repeat for an hour.  And it's one o'clock in the morning.

      Thunderstorms are quite wonderful things aren't they?  This one has probably been going for about two hours now, and the worst (or best) of it is over.  The sky is sort of beigy brown, and I can't see the sun anymore.  Which is odd because I can't make out the shapes of clouds either.  So after a nice sunny spell (TWO DAYS - that's all the summer we've had), we in Britain have thunderstorms.  But that's okay because I quite like them.  It's begun to rain again and the flashes of lightning (absolutely spectacular purple/white daggers) are becoming more frequent again.  The thunder claps are really quite amazing, probably the loudest noises I've ever heard - immense rumbles.  I like the storms because its cool and impressive.  - Really driving rain now, massive thunder-  The sun may be all very nice but I hate feeling hot and sticky, especially the awful humidity that we seem to always have.  I went to Henley yesterday to see an elderly relative on my mum's side.  If you don't know Henley and I don't that well I'll explain a bit.  The way we arrive, you cross an old bridge which has two signs on each side of the road saying ominously: 'only one loaded truck at a time.  Drivers are responsible for damages.'  Of course there's no one around enforcing this and we, of course, are stuck behind a large truck.  The bridge crosses the Thames, and you go over into the main street, lined by shops none of which stand out at all and up towards a city hall-esque building.  It's very pretty but hardly mindblowing or in-your-face impressive, but apparently it's the most expensive town in the country.  So of course this is where this elderly relative chooses to live.  She was born in Barbados, and she's the cousin of my grandma who was also brought up on the island.  At 86, she has lost 5 inches in height, her husband and the life she used to lead.  She described her life in New York to us when my mum mentioned my trip to NY this coming October.  I could see her eyes light up, she described a life of complete freedom - never being tied down in one place, forever moving house (renting - "of course") and just enjoying life.  It sounds incredible, she said how she couldn't imagine leading a life living in the same house all her life.  It was almost sad seeing her there.  My life and hers are completely detached, I don't think that she really knows me or who I really am but I can see her, overjoyed at seeing us (me, brother and sister).  She's still mobile, her back is bent appallingly so she can't drive anymore or even sit in a car for very long but she walks everywhere and is still agile for a woman of her age.  Still, it's sad seeing her living alone in a single room, a downstairs flat, below the landlady.  She still is a powerful character.  She said while we were there that time may have taken her body from her but her soul is still there.  While we were out sitting on a bench overlooking the river, she noticed a woman, probably about the same age as her, all dressed up, with make-up and everything - the whole lot.  Monica couldn't help saying, loudly, 'look at her'.  My mum and I just looked at each other.  We couldn't help laughing when she got up and walked towards the river, pretending to look at the water before turning around to stare at the dressed-up woman.  I don't want to grow old but hey, if I can still be me at 86, I'll be happy.
