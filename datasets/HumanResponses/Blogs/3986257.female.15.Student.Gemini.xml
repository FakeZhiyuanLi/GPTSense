      There is glitter where you are A spotlight in the dim hallway And there are people creeping in the shadows that you are not aware of.  You are lost, lost in your own perfection, While I silently wait for you to snap out of your&nbsp;shining world and into the hands of your&nbsp;over- the- edge admirers, Blind to their own jealousy.  And it seems that I can't stand here another minute.  So when I run off, Don't be alarmed, just be afraid. I'm not protecting your useless causes anymore.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      went to bed at midnight...so of course i didnt go jogging since i slept in. oh well. maybe tomorrow, haha.  anyway, i want to get another rachael sage cd, its only 12 dollars or something so im seriously considering it...maybe i'll wait until next weeks paycheck. in the meantime, i need to use up my giftcard at old navy. i cant get any pants there, coz they're all 30 dollars and i have 28 on my card...figures, right? and thats really all i need - jeans. i mean i haev jeans, but they're so annoying. jeans are like that - you can never find a perfect pair. one fits nice but it shows thighs, one gets loose after a while, one is too low - they fit perfect when you try them on at the store and then you take them home, and its like, "crap."  mom asys i sholdnt get jeans, i shuold get khakis, but then you can only wear them at certain times. well not neccesarily. but i would.  another thing i need to decide - a picture day shirt. i dont have a lot of "nice" shirts, mainly ones that say something on it. i love the photographers in GCHS - they make you look really good in pictures. seriously. everyone looked pretty okay in their pictures.  i hope my aunt leaves today. not that i dont love her. but we just kicked the last houseguests out of the house, and now there are 2 more. its like, god, could we live in peace?  my grandma got me the prettiest bracelet from san francisco. she also got me a shirt - its super girly. why do ppl think i wear girly things? also one eyar she wrapped my preent in barbie wrapping paper. i didnt asy anything, but, its like, "hi, im 15, i really dont play barbies anymore. they're all skinny blondes with big boobs." but i am grateful that she at least thinks of me.   not doing too much today - the usual practice and playing with my rats, and im going to start typing up my lesson.   hasta la pasta! gina

      Its so pitiful. they say grandpa is deteriorating. deteriorating. dying, they mean. its just another word to take place of the word they dont want to say. god im scared. i know that sounds so stupid, but i hate grief. it just sneaks into your house and pounces upon you when you least expect it. and then it drips onto the walls and everyones bodies and takes them over. and the world seems to turn gray and cold, even when the sun is shining beautifully. it makes me sick to think of men cry, to think of all those sad crying faces. hes not dead. no, not yet. i have hope, but its so small - hes always falling down, a nurse visits him twice a week, they say that just this week hes been looking so much worse. i dont know what to do.  they say the goddess Kali teaches us to accept death and to rejoice life, its all part of the circle. but i hate grief. do i hate the fact that im going to deal with grief, or the fact that grandpa will not be around anymore? and what about grandma? will she die of a broken heart? or will she age and will her core be nothing but mechaniacal? i want answers, but there is no way to get them, and i am scared shitless.  he could die today, tomorrow, a week later, a day when i'e gone out with my friends and have had a good time. its so sudden, so quick, like snapping fingers or blinking eyes. im so worried. we were never close. then again, uncle g and i werent close either. so then why do i are so much? why do i care, if i never cared before? im so spoiled rotten, to not care until the last minute - you dont know how precious things are until you know you're going to lose them.  i know i'll have to accept grief gratefully. but whats so grateful about tears and tissues, long, sobbed hugs and "i'm so sorry"'s? whats so grateful about going to mass, a church, a deity i dont worship and signing sad, mournful songs? i like to cry alone, and all this, its with other people. i cant seek comfort from other people, when their comfort might be fake. i cant bear to see my father crying all over again. i cant bear to see everyone in so much misery.   sometimes when you feel lonely and angry with yourself you say, "god if i left this world no one would care." but they would, even the ones that thought they wouldnt care really would.   ugh. im going to go watch that comedy to cheer myself up. love, gina

      Well today was all right - we went to On the Border to eat (yummmmm) and then took a walk by this one river. it was really peaceful, and we saw this huge white bird - i forget what they're called. and then we went home to eat cake, and we found out TS, who had not been w/ us and was supposed to go to Country Thunder, had been "stood up" by her friends.  she bought a ticket to the concert and was sure her friends were going to go with her, and they had bought tickets also, but at last minute they couldnt go with her, and they had used TS's mula to buy the tickets, so they owe her a chunk. her friend is a bit light headed and "full of butterflies" and never plans anything. so TS was in a tizzy and crying - she had just wasted about 300 bucks. maybe more. but she said it wasnt really about the money, but it was about how her friends had stood her up when they had been planning this for weeks.  mom said that she learned that lesson early - friends always stand you up. And you know, its true. friends do stand you up. they make these big gorgeous plans, and at last minute, "nope sorry cant do that." its already happened to me. its a part of life, i guess, disapointment - and knowing that your friends arent perfect and that you will have to make sacrifices for them. its sad, but i guess thats the way it goes.   but, i dont like the philosophy that not having friends makes you a happy person. it doesnt, not really. you're actually more depressed when you dont have friends. family is all right, but when you need to talk about sex, about drugs, about the things you dont want to say to your family, who do you turn to? friends. and some friends are like vampires and they suck your blood to make themselves look cool and popular, and those friends turn out to be not friends at all. some friends are like dummies and ditzes&nbsp;and all they'll talk about is guys and make up.   im not saying that if you and your friends talk about guys and make up its stupid, but 24/7 yakking about the same subject can get pretty dull.  and then there are those great friends who will sacrifice a lot for you. like once, i was really, really pissed, and sad, and angry about nothing. it was just one of those days. and i told my friend, and we went on the bus, and i was like, "god, i just feel like killing someone, like screaming." so, she had a crush on the bus back then. it was her fav time of day, to be near him. and she pulled me off that bus so we could walk home and she could hear me scream. and i screamed, and we talked, and i was so grateful to her. i know what its like, when you have a crush and something comes up so you cant be near them. but it made me realize that having a&nbsp;relationship is a tough thing - you sacrifice, you cry, you get mad at each other, you lie, etc.   but the funny, funny thing is, is thats its worth it. its worth the blood and the tears and the joy. and if you have had a friend that makes you work for those blood and tears and joy, you know that they're worth it.   ok, end of my long rambling.  love, gina

      She went looking for love and found her reflection,  She sought crystal clear&nbsp;and the utmost perfection,  Her life was in tears, her body in pain,  She wanted a sweetheart to make sure she was sane,  So she went on a walk to contemplate this,  And saw a white flower, which she gave a kiss,  And she glanced at the water, so light and so fresh,  And wondered how she ever got into this mess.  She stopped as she saw her eyes gazing back,  So ruined were they, they almost looked black,  She missed the warm days of sunshine and singing,  She missed those sweet&nbsp;days when her ears weren't ringing.   She splashed at the water and cried in the creek,  She wanted some strength,&nbsp;and she seemed&nbsp;so weak,  And the creek bubbled back, and it talked and it soothed,  And the girl was astonished,&nbsp; amazed, she was moved.   "Listen," it said, "listen, come here,  Why do you waste these cold&nbsp;bitter&nbsp;tears?  Can't you see that each day is your own?  Can't you see that you're free to roam?  Why do you weep, girl,&nbsp;why do you cry?  Don't you see your wings, that you can fly?  Don't let them strangle you, girl, you can fight,  And, most important, don't let your goals out of sight."   To this speech she listened with care and control,  And inside she felt a strange, little pull,  She wanted to love, she wanted to live,  And instead of taking, she wanted to give.  She laughed til she cried and cried til she smiled,  Her whole thoughtful walk had been well worth the while,  And she bent toward the creek and gave it good thanks,  She kissed its waters and its green, glowing banks.  She glanced at the water, so light and so fresh,  And wondered how she could get out of this mess,  She stopped as she saw her eyes gazing back,  So full of mirth, of joy, and so black.   She left the waters, but her soul was still there,  No longer was she in deep, doomed despair,  For she bubbled like the creek, and was in love with each day,  And she became an old wise woman, a&nbsp; healer, a sage.  So when her patients are in pain and in tears,  She tells them to&nbsp;touch their deepest,&nbsp;dark fears,  And go to the creeks waters and look for perfection,  And they usually find that it is in their reflection.

       I know, I already have an lj, but i figured i'd just use this for a bit. things are going okay - as in nothing dramatic is happening. my god i went swimming today, my eyes were all red. i know i should wear goggles, but i feel so stupid wearing them....i know, i know, safety first, then looks, right? right.     &nbsp;  i guess im sort of waiting up for my sister, dont know why though. shes so bossy, gina do this, gina do that and gina you're not doing it right.     &nbsp;  work tomorrow. not very excited. and im going jogging. im so lazy, i have to will myself to get up to go jogging, and then L is like, "gina, go, its good for you, its an adventure!"    &nbsp;  i've been seeing  him  a lot. ugh. gooo awaaayyyy. why'd i like him again?    &nbsp;  oh, yeah. he was nice. funny, i dont see that characteristic in him nowadays.    &nbsp;  moving on, im excited. not sure about what. you know that feeling that says, "something cool will happen..." yeah, thats the one.    &nbsp;  *sigh* well, not much more to talk about. i watched The Sound of Music the other day. its so interesting, how a nun can just give it all up for a guy. but then again, does she erally give it up? its sad that they dont put more focus on the spiritual, just the romance.    &nbsp;  i think too much, dont i? lol    &nbsp;  love always,   gina    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Stiff as a board You lay there, unaware Sleeping soundly but not snoring And I kind of miss that about you.  Flowers seem to poke out of nowhere In their glory presented to you But do you notice, do you care? Because all I wish is that you were here.  You were always a piece of string hanging in the air Not sure where to go or what the hell to do But you always bowed and smiled so humbly And my hearts mind is flooded with the grief Of having to finally let go of you.  I hope you're happy when no one else is You deserve it, you really do. And I hope you got all that you asked for up there And tell God I'm waiting, too.  So you're stiff as ice up on that altar But you see, you're slowly melting... You're going into that place where we all dream We could go without pain.

      you know, it just figures. im having the worst month of my life. every movie i see is making me cry, i dont want to do anything except be alone, and i want to stick my nose in a bunch of novels and forget my life here ever existed. im sick of my sister screaming and clawing at my back, im tired of looking at my moms tired face, and i've lost the thrill for self defense. actually i've lost the thrill for even writing. i cant write anymore, nothing works. i feel like throwing up in the face of this gray weather and if one more thing goes wrong i think i might crack.  i thought i had thought everything through the other night, that being miserable wasnt worth anything. i thought i had cried the last time. but god i am so pathetic, i was watching the end of Casper the Friendly Ghost and had to excuse myself to go sob quietly. everything jut really sucks. i dont want to go to self defense tonight or ever again, i dont want to go to my grandma's house to dwell in her past and grandpa's death, and i dont want to pick up my violin anymore. dad noticed and even suggested some welbutrin the other day. im not sure what everything im dealing with has to do with why im sad, depressed, angry. i really shouldnt be depressed. i dont have much to be depressed about, do i?  but i will go to self defense, b/c if i miss one more class they'll start thinking im a wuss. they're men there, i need to show them women are just as good as men. and i will go to grandma's house, because she needs me to comfort her. and i will pick up the violin and start writing again, and i will be happy.  just not now.

      i am pissed. i want to get back to my life before all the shit of the blue moon happened. turns out this friday until next friday i am staying at my grandma's house with my brother, and returning home 3 days before school starts. where did summer go??  the thing is, i want to go school shopping, and make plans with a couple friends, and do things, but i dont know when. its like august 25 is a deadline or something. im just in a really sucky mood - i saw beauty and the beast today to cheer myself up, and i ended up crying. and you know, why cant i stay alone in the house just for a couple days? i dont want to be in grandmas house overnight - last year it was just for 3 days and i lost my head.  everythings just a fucking disaster

      biggg day. i didnt go to self defense (again) so i feel guilty.  heres what happened:  4 kids. 5 1/2 hours.  and actually they're good kids. the only one that really needed watching was my own brother.  then around 11 or so my cousin came, so i had to watch over him too. but hes cute and sweet tempered.  i was happy - they all really liked me, i had made a good impression as a baby sitter.  but now im really tired.  i went to the pool instead of self defense, and it felt so good, just to swim. my brother said i swam like a mermaid! i was really happy about that compliment.  hey i just recieved news someone is interested in our religious group! yes!  i am happy.  love, gina

      Another uneventful day in our family....hah! fooled you for a sec, didnt i? nope, today we went fishing, and of course caught nothing, but dad dropped his pole in the water and got his line caught on a sign that said "fox lake"...   then we ate out for lunch, went home, and went to jewel to get fish for dinner, so that at least we could pretend we had caught something.  tomorrow im going to be looking after 4 kids from 9:30-3. someone save me, i think i might lose my head.  actually, it wont be that bad - most kids like me. i mean, look at my cousins (the younger ones) every time i walk in the room they pounce on me and demand a spooky story or a story about prince charming and a damsel in distress.  heres my schedule:  9:30-10 = painting, crafts, drawing 10-12- outside games, tag, waterguns, set up the sprinkler, go to the park 12-12:30- eat lunch 12:30-1:30= quiet time, reading (the girls are archie comic book fans!), teaching spanish? watch movie until parents come? 2-3- chalk, maybe petting the rats, anything else i can think of from the top of my head  lets see how tomorrow goes. also, i've got self defense alone tomorrow  since ts is hanging out with friends.  fuunnnn. did i tell you after my dad treated me with yet another medical miracle, my canker sore hurt even more???  oh, plus...you'll never guess that im spending 7-9 days with one of my grandma's, since mom and dad are going on their twentieth anniversary, ts will be moving back into her apartment, and the dreaded brother will be with  me.  i get back 3 days before school starts. some way to end my summer.  i cant say i've had a bad summer, but it wasnt really the best, was it? too much death and pain and grief. that and all this stress is really getting to me.  but i've been away from the world for a while, and its time to go back. i've been hiding out in my room, crying, thinking, sleeping, being sick. i need to get into the routine of excercising and being friendly.  its only 7 and i feel dead tired. and i wake up tired, and i go through my day tired. so i just need to break through. i feel like such a disgusting slug lately. i dont care about how i look and i shower twice a day to feel refreshed. that and i've only had a million canker sores.  i get at least $25 tomorrow. im going to treat myself to, if i can get a hold of her, a movie w/ my friend, lots of new tshirts, and maybe a CD.  whats 25 x 4?  my god that was a stupid question.  100 dollars. wooowwwwwww. technically, 130.  wooowwwww.  i loooove baysitting!!!  gina

        I hate    glancing  into     your    kaliedoscope    eyes     Because  each time I do I wonder what form I take from your view.   Rainbow shards of glass seem to be reflecting off my eyelashes,   And you twist and blink until I become what you can take over.

      well....i was watching hidalgo last night and we didnt get very far into the movie before i went upstairs and threw up. twice. yuck yuck yuck. thankfully mom says its only a 24 hour bug and i should be fine y the time me and mr go mini golfing. but i slept in due to the throwing up thing so i didnt do my ritual. ugh, it seems like every time i want to perform it something gets in the way. first grandpa's death, the fairgrounds noise, my family, the canker sore, now its this stomach virus. im going to go insane. i wonder whats next??  i didnt eat at all yesterday except for some soup, tea, and a glass of milk, so i checked my weight this morning and i've lost a couple pounds.  i dont feel like eating anything now, either. but i gotta brush my teeth. my breath probably stinks like mad.  gina

       i woke up this morning feeling nacious. i showered, then got back in bed, fell asleep, and woke up at 1 in the afternoon.  i dont feel so good, but i dont want to get sick now - i want to go mini golfing with mr tomorrow and do my ritual at 4 am. yes i know its an ungodly hour - right after i do it im planning to go right back to sleep.  so, it seems as if i have a babysitting job all next week! i'll be sitting my brother and his friend from 9-3 mon-thurs. but i think i'll have fun with it, i love kids. most of the time anyway. but my brothers friend is a good kid, not rambunctious or noisy like him, so it'll be okay. i want every day with them to be special, so i want to make days like "movie day" and "painting day" and maybe "water day." this way maybe zs will like me, and then his mom will want me to sit him more, and then i will earn a friend and some cash.  im still very much a kid at heart, so jumping over sprinklers and water gun fights and games of freeze tags are sooo much fun. especially if you have 5 or 10 ppl, then its great...  well, ta ta, off to watch a movie  gina

      it was one of those days where...you wake up and think, "god, it is going to be such a crap day...." and then just to trick you, god decides to trip the opposite upon reality.  i went to grandma's house, hung out with my cousins. we watched some movies....some new ones, some old, funny ones. then we started playing with waterguns toward night. and me and cs were trying to gain up on ds, it was great....oh, did i mention my aunt is distantly related to bill nye the science guy? how cool is that?!  i'll miss them so much, but i know they'll come back. i want another family reunion. with everyone. its so much fun, just to sit there among conversations and know that you're safe and everyone in the room loves you. its truly a blessing that i sometimes take for granted.  no, i did not go to self defense. ts says B gave a talk about how we should devote more time to the art of self defense, but really....my grandpa died, im spending time with my cousins, and im figuring myself and my surroundings out for the first time in my life. excuse me for breathing.  then again, ts is stupid b/c she didnt tell them our grandpa died, she just sad i was sick. im going to tell them the truth. she says she doesnt want sympathy - i dont think theres anything wrong with it. she thinks shes so tough, so like a guy, so much armor. but i see her, shes as weak as the rest of us. i love her though.  i dont want to take life and the things i do and love for granted anymore. people, they take out their cell phones, their gadgets, their little shiny toys and flash them around. they dont want to be near mommy and daddy, dont wanna be close to the things they know they love most.  i had a dream last night...i saw a statue of a girl. she seemed to be lying on the grass, holding something, just sitting there, wishing and dreaming. yet she was living as much as anyone else, she wasnt wasting her time. and i picked up the statue and i wanted to buy it, but it didnt have a price tag. i promised myself no matter how much it cost i would buy it because it represented me, with my back on the grass staring up at the clouds. then i woke up.  i want to paint it now. the statue.  k, im tired. sleepy time.  love gina

      such a good day today, like being born after so much death and pain. me and my cousins walked all over chicago, and the sun and earth reminded me that things are and can be reborn, even after the most defeating struggle. and i sweat and was strong and calm. feels like a tree sometimes, ya know?  but if im a tree, im one heck of a young tree. got so much to learn, to do, to finish and tie promises. and i can wait for my day of rest, because i feel so full of life.  and i will be honest, you wont hear me say this in winter, lol. in winter i'll be muttering curses about the snow.  love gina

      i am still the puffy cheeked chipmunk - dads surgic thingy didnt really help. well, yes it did. but now i feel more canker sores coming on, and am having a ball trying to overcome the desire to chew.  mom came home and said, "gina, i think your other cheek is looking a bit swollen..." and of course, its not, shes just imagining things *hopes*  besides being a puffy cheeked chipmunk i am also rudolph the red nosed reindeer, with that zit on my nose. front and center. im going to have a simply lovely freshman year.  to top it off with a sour cherry, we've got self defense tonight, and not only will i attract uwanted attention, i'll be missing a family barbecue.  im such a whiner. but at this point in time i've really come close to saying, "why me, god??!" its not fun. its just one thing after the other, and maybe before i go to sleep tonight the house will burn down. or someone else will die. or i'll be eaten alive by grandma's next door neighbors dogs.  the possibilities are endless.  yaya is okay - shes got major bruises, but no broken ribs or anything, thirteen stitches, one cut really close to her jugular. she fell down the stairs and crashed headlong into a glass vase. she broke it with her head.  i am really, really, really stressed out. think of stressed out as stretching, and imagine putty stretched out all the way until it breaks. thats me.  i think sophomore year may be the worst year of my high school career. but, hey. bring it on, right?  right.  *rolls eyes* gina

      this is just one of those times where optimism realllyyyy helps. heres whats going on.  you know that lovely canker sore?  it has puffed up my right cheek.  i officially resemble a chipmunk.  so im going into the office today to have it burned off. *starts praying profusely* dad promises that i'll still be able to eat afterwards, but seeing as i cant even eat now (i can barely open my mouth, and when the food does get inside, it hurts like hell on the open sores) i dont have much hope.  this isnt the first time i've had inflammation due to a canker sore - last time it was on my lip. my parents were away and i had to go to orchestra, my sister was going to drive me, but i stayed locked up in my room and she decided to leave without me, which is what i had planned. i think i like a swollen cheek better than the lip.  i woke up at 4 am last night and was soo thirsty. i've been thirsty ever since i've had this sore. so i went downstairs, drank first regular coke, then det coke, then chugged down water. this morning after attempting and then failing to eat my cereal i drank about 2 cups of milk.  guess what? im still thirsty, lol.  its not so bad, if i dont talk or eat or smile it doesnt hurt. and hey, it'll be over in a couple days. i wanted to have fun at the fair (which i kinda didnt) and i wanted to have fun with my cousins, who are here until thursday, but my cousins can always visit and the fair will be here next year. and my cousins were really nice about it, i felt bad b/c i never felt like talking and i think they thought i was being rude and ignoring them.  i'll try making it up to them today.  so, my 2 activities left in the Isis lesson are postponed until all this is over. there will be more blue moons, right?  oh yeah, and guess what? yaya fell down the stairs and cracked her head open. its just thing after thing this summer, isnt it? but i always thought that her stairs were really steep, even as a child i didnt dare walk down. its a wonder she hasnt allen down until today. dad says she'll be fine. i sure hope so. damn stairs. im thinking of getting a one floor house - this isnt the first time one of my relatives have fallen down the stairs.  love, gina

      i am in the pits.  i guess all the stress from grandpa dying and the funeral and everything has made a big impact on me, because now i have a cold sore. i havent gotten a cold sore since last halloween. it always happens with the big events. i was at the lunch after the funeral in the restraunt when i felt the "symptoms" of a cold sore, but of course i couldnt rush home and take some valtrex, which usually pushes it away before the cold sore arrives. by the time i got home, i officially had a cold sore. this was supposed to be a fun day. me and sg are going to the fair today. now i wont be able to properly enjoy it.  and im getting really sick of my sister. she always has to find time to correct me in everything i do. like, i dont mind if she says, "your violin is out of tune, you should do this and this to make it better" or "that painting would be better with a touch of bule or green." but every single little thing i do makes her mad and shes ALWAYS correcting me.  "you drink soda weird" "thats not how you're supposed to use your spoon/fork/knife" "nothing at all really goes on inside your head" "you use the toothpaste wrong"  and on and on. and its with things i say, too. i try and make a joke, shes all "that wasn't funny" or "that didnt make sense" or something like that. she gets that part from mom - mom doesnt laugh a lot. i showed her the bday card i was going to give sg and she read it andgave me a tight-lipped half-smile. when i read the card myself i burst out giggling. people these days. sheesh.  and then half the time tasha acts like a 3 year old and the other half she tries to be cool and be in charge of everybody.  last night, she was all, "mommy....daddy....i dont wanna go to work on monday..." in this sappy childish voice. shes 19. give me a break.  "im tired..." "i dont wanna go to grandmas house, i have a headache..."  she always has a headache. she gets migraines (rarely) but in her life she has a headache every day. im startign to wonder if they're fake or not.  and then she is just plain bossy.  she doesnt act like this towards her friends, at least i dont think. just her family. and i dont think its grandpa dying that stressed me out, actually i was pretty okay with it. i think its her. i've tried talking to dad about it, trying to convince him she needs to be on something like zoloft or welbutrin, but he just jokes about how she always "lets off steam" or has "perpetual PMS."  i cant wait until the beginning of school just b/c thats when shes leaving.  i mean, part of e will miss her, but most of me is wanting to pull her hair, break her glasses, and give her a good punch to set her crooked nose straight.
