          My mom told me that I needed to forgive, because I had a bitter root and I had not. For some reason everything makes sense when she says it. I had read that I needed to forgive for God to heal me, but when she said it, I knew it was true. I have decided to forgive, because I was forgiven when I least deserved it and I would give Satan a foothold not to forgive. Many people I know are bitter, and I do not want to be like them.    I need to have better boundaries though. I need to know when I should speak up. Because most of the time I do, but sometimes I think I might hurt someone, so I say nothing. That is not right. I thought, though, that if I forgave then I would be putting myself back into the position I was in where I got hurt. I can still forgive but make different choices so I don't set myself up for the same hurt. If we had a friendship, I believe that we could learn to treat each other correctly, and we could both come into our healing, without hindering each other or being completely cut off.      One time at work, Kim told me I was acting pregnant and I told her it wasn't possible. We started joking, though, about me being the virgin Mary because if I were pregnant, I would have to be. Last night I had this dream about this baby. Many babies really, but in the dream there was a baby I was taking care of, and I think it was Jesus. I was nursing the baby, so it was a really nice dream.

          Soon the pain will be gone.   I worked today. I was supposed to be by myself but Courtney came in, so I got to go home three hours early. Which was great. Only I didn't have a ride back, because I was dropped off. My parents and Solveig dropped me off on their way to Boston. My boss thought she was my sister, everyone says we look similar so that wasn't a surprise. If I could pick a sister I would pick her. The only thing was while I worked, I talked to Courtney about what was going on, which I mean, it was good to talk about, but then I had it on my mind, and that was insufferable.   After work I sat outside waiting for my grandfather. It was so beautiful. I was sitting on the retaining wall, listening to the wind, my hair blowing whichever way. He was so happy when I got into the car, and it was so cool. When I got home, I read a few things about bitterness and forgiveness on this website, byfaith.co.uk, something like that. I don't know why, but I cried. I know I'm bitter, some days are meant for grieving though, and I know I'll get passed them. Now I'm listening to Jason Upton. The thing is, sometimes I feel very hopeful, and other times I feel completely suppressed. I need to hold on to any hope I can get.

          Poppy red for today.      I took my last final yesterday, and it was so easy. The other one was really hard, and I wasn't sure if I did well at all, but I got like a 91 or 97, one of those, so I was amazed. I was psyched about this one though. Because the stuff was pretty hard, and I wasn't really sure if I'd gotten it or not. That means though, that I got to sleep in for the first time during the week in a year. This is good. This is very good.   I had a dream that Arne was the president of Germany. (Anybody hear yesterday was the anniversary of Hitler becoming president of Germany?) I do not need anyone to tell me that they don't have a president, I  know  it's a chancellor. But he was the president. It was a dream. We were at church, but it looked more like a school. I always dream about these complexes, I don't know what that could mean. Needless to say, Arne was there. My friends kept asking me, He's the president and you still won't go out with him?    Of Germany, I told them, not America.   They didn't seem to think it mattered. I thought that it didn't change anything. He seemed like a nice guy, though.      Oh, Kristina, I had this dream about us the other week. We were riding around on motorcycles at night, and I think you didn't have your lights on. So we went to our apartment which was on 125. It was still pretty dark in there, and we had different floors in it. There were these black bears trying to get us though. I told you that if you quote Bible verses about God protecting you, they can't hurt you.   Later I had a dream in which I was telling your dad the same thing. Which is sorta weird.    I dream a lot about these big, beautiful houses. They are huge and breathtaking. They always shine and have an expansive yard. The first one I saw I thought was heaven. I think they are the mansions we will have in heaven.    I had this one dream last week, it was so cool. There was this slide, like at an amusement park or something. It was like a water slide sort of, just without the water. There was a person at the top who threw you down, and a person at the bottom who caught you. It was for little girls, but I wanted to go down it. Most of the little girls were wearing red dresses, and I was wearing a shimmery or sequined red dress, and heels, and I wanted to go down it, and they thought that I looked feminine enough even though I wasn't young enough. The girl who caught the people at the bottom didn't want me to go down, but the guy at the top said that I was definitely a princess, so I got to go down it. It was fun.   I also had a dream last night, before I woke up, and Solveig had stayed a few days longer, and she was telling us what an awful time she had. I was debating if I should tell her how much I couldn't stand her either . . .      Here are the Bible verses I recite to myself a lot:       No weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is from Me," Says the Lord.  Isaiah 54:17 NKJV       For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of  power and of love and of a sound mind.     2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV       Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is kept safe.  Proverbs 29:25 NIV         I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.  Philippians 4:13 NKJV       Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret-it leads only to evil.  Psalm 37:8 NIV       Vindicate me in your righteousness, O LORD my God; do not let them gloat over me.  Psalm 35:24 NIV       Vindicate me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; rescue me from deceitful and wicked men.  Psalm 43:1 NIV       Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.  Psalm 54:1 NIV      About the last three, I was looking for one about God's vindication, and I couldn't pick my favorite out of them, because I think that all of them I direly need.

          Do you ever think that days should have color? Midnight blue for mysterious, pink for happy and carefree, red for intense, light blue could be sleepy . . . sorta life today.       I was trying to get *stuff* out of my mind, so, I just thought about my dream job. Because I really just wanted to think interesting thoughts about the future and it actually really helped. I was thinking about all those things I like and and interested in. Like Africa, AIDS, traveling, Sean Hannity -- that sort of thing. Claire called me in an hour early, and I didn't even notice it was longer than yesterday. I really like working there. It's so much better than Dunkin Donuts, when they would call me in early, it like ruined my entire week :-) I know they appreciate me at Donut Connection though, which they most definitely did not at Dunkin Donuts. I mean, they hated me there, and Claire wants to beat up nameless people who I feel are taking advantage of me. Now the only people who hate me are in Germany, and I never ever have to see them!!       After work I was talking to Sarah and she told me that Kristina, Courtney and her were going to see a movie and I could come if I want. Arne was coming over so I wasn't sure if I could or not, but it sounded fun. He came over, and we talked about boring stuff, then he got on to telling my parents how much his family hates me, and how shocked they were that I'm actually such an awful person. He really hasn't gotten that he really should try to make a good impression on my parents, because if he loses them, he loses everything. But I guess he really already has. I left when he started back on that, because I heard it once and I could never again. I called Sarah, Kristina, Gladys, and then Courtney and probably Sarah again. My dad said that I should ask Arne if he wanted to come, which I wanted to, it's just everyone else told me why he shouldn't come at supper. I asked him, and he wanted to, but he was nervous. I thought it would be fun, and it was, but he wasn't too vocal with my friends. He always complained that he wanted to meet my friends, but I guess he changed his mind. Or something.      Does it make sense to lose weight when you start a new job? I saw Sean Cotter at work today, he came in for a coffee.      Today may have actually been  green , because it was an awesome day. It's weird to want to be away from a person you really love. I guess that shows I forgave him, but am not going to walk back into the same position where I was hurt.      I really like waterfalls. That would be a good place to swim. Almost as good as the ocean, but I'd have to have tried both to be able to say.      If I had a favorite number, what would it be? Eleven? The number that haunts me?      Sebastian is really cute. Sam gave me a bunch of donuts (six again) but it was good because all these people were here, so they got to eat them. I had part of one. Actually, Sam had a lot to make up for, because he wanted to set me up with his thirty year old son . . . definitely from the middle east . . .

          Good for me, the day wasn't over.   I talked to Arne that night for a bit. I still didn't sleep that night. (So, three nights of not sleeping for me is sleeping about six hours each night.) Sunday I was in the nursery, Adam and Bernice's baby is so cute. I love him. Such a cutie, so good.    We dropped Solveig off at the airport, and then when we got home Arne and I talked some more. Supposedly it was three hours, we thought it was two though, so I'm still confused.      What is love?       I don't know. He even asked me if I knew yesterday, but although I told him I did not, he told me he did.      What is truth?       If love is not truth, than I do not know a thing about either. For isn't telling the truth love?   Then we went to pick up David Miller. I knew he was cool, and he was wicked cool. One of the coolest. :-) He had a cool ponytail, too. My brothers have long hair, so I must feel some comfort from guys with long hair, you think? Anyway, it was my dad, Arne and me and my dad told him that Arne was my friend, and David asked Arne how he knew me, and Arne told him that he met my brother at school. David asked if he was still friends with my brother, which Arne said yes to, but my dad and I let on that might not be too exact.   Arne seemed like the man I fell in love with, I wish I were not so easily convinced.   I went up for prayer because he said that Job thought he deserved the things he'd received in life, and he did not, he was given them by grace. Likewise, I felt that I deserved things that I apparently do not, and I need God's grace terribly so. Before he prayed for me, he had a word for me, and he spoke of how pure I am, how devoted and close to God. He spoke of the light in my eyes, which I thought I had lost. Then he said that God and I were going to live in Zion, in perfect peace. It was so beautiful, because that is my one dream. I sort of started crying when he was praying, and then I almost fell, and I was hugging Pastor Rita, then I was hugging my dad, and it was really good that I was crying, because I hadn't in a while. Then I think I was going to sit down, but then I fell down, and I was crying and coughing, and I had the worst pain in my stomach.   Eventually for some reason my parents and I were going into another room, but then I thought I was going to throw up, so we went into the bathroom. Eventually it was Pastor Rita and my mom in there with me, but it may have just been my mom for a while, I really don't know. I got some great deliverance, though! It was awesome. I thought I would burst if I didn't get to scream soon, and I finally got to scream. It was good though, a scream of release.   When I finally came out, my real friends were there for me. So many people came over and hugged me. Alexis and Marisele said that they cried when he spoke to me, too. Susannah and Priscilla were there, they'd been taking care of kids, so I was glad we went into the bathroom instead of the room right next to them. I felt a million pounds lighter, though, after I didn't have that thing in my stomach anymore. My mom and I went outside, were Arne was, and we talked to him for a little while before we left. He always had issues when I would fall out in the spirit, so I guess whatever he saw was still too much for him. (Oh, by the way Mike, Susannah told me to say hi to you for her.) It was good for me, and that's what matters.    Ahhh, what does the number eleven symbolize?? It won't leave me alone.    I finally slept. I listened to Todd Agnew, who actually sings a lot about grace :-) I slept in my room alone :-D and I slept for like nine or ten hours. I was very contemplative when I awoke. My mom came in to tell me she was going out with Pastor Rita, and I thought for a while. I thought about right and wrong, love and faithfulness. I once said that the right thing at the wrong time is the wrong thing. I know I heard it from someone, so I'm not claiming anything, but it's quite a thought. I thought about lies and trickery, relativity and confusion.    I think my parents will protect me. My dad wouldn't let anyone hurt me.

      Doug Weiss was at my church tonight, he is so cool. I have loved this guy for years.  We've had the filter he always talks about on our computer for years as well.  He was at church in the morning, and I took care of the kids, then I went home and slept for a couple of hours (because I haven't been doing that at night), and got up and went back to church.  It was an A-class day. Hopefully its not over yet, because there is still more I would like to do.  Doug was really funny, too.  I mean, I feel totally sorry for every person that wasn't there.  He's a counselor, so he's really smart.  He also does sexual addiction research, which I thought was really cool.  Any kind of research is cool, and this is really needed and it's helping a lot of people.  Yes, hopefully I can calm down enough before I am totally exhausted tonight, I want to finally be able to go sleep.

      I wish everything could be different. I wish I could be asleep right now. Its not like I was just lying down for more than an hour . . .  I can't sleep though, because even though I'm wicked tired my mind and heart are racing. Not my heart as in my pulse. You ever want to be mad at someone so much? Ever try so hard not to care about them the slightest bit? Ever done this and then found out you were still in love with that person? Yes, well, I've spent so long feeling like everyone is trying to stab me, and now I've found out I stabbed myself worse than anyone else has. Ever have one of those moments of realization, where what you thought you knew was right beyond a shadow of a doubt -- was wrong? Dead wrong? I don't know what to do. I can't change the past, I can't change anyone else. I just hope its not too late. More waiting? I'm going to melt into a pile of slime if I have to wait any longer. If I had known all this would happen I would have thought I'd have cracked long ago. Like an egg, with all that runny white stuff dripping down all the people I love who I exploded onto. I've blamed everybody else until I was blue in the face, I've been completely shocked that people would treat me the way they have, think of me in the ways I knew they have, and I was so sure if I forgave even one of them they would all walk all over me. Now all I can think is that I am so immature. I am so selfish, I am so cranky and self-absorbed. Who do I think I am? I think that every person owes me because of how awfully they've treated me. Who am I?   What is man that you are mindful of him?      There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.   I feel pretty near dead right now.  Will you ever talk to me again?

      What can I say? I wanted today to be as normal as possible. I had a beautiful day. I realized that I love going to work so much because there is less peace in my home with all these people here. On my way home from work, when I was halfway down Hunt Road, I started to think that there was a possibility that there would be extra company at my house. No, no, no way, I told myself. Yet when I pulled into the driveway there sat a black Jetta. So the first person I see when I walk into my house was the last person I would have wanted. He smiled and said hi, so did I, at least I said hi, I may have smiled, and my mom asked me if I had donuts, and I had six, which is a record, then I changed and came back down . . . and guess what? He had reverted into "I'm-not-going-to-talk-or-look-at-you" mode, and although I didn't want him to do either, it just seemed immeasurably dumb. He comes to my house, he waits for me . . . and he thinks I am going to melt all over him and forget the months and months I suffered? No. I acted how I always acted, I treated him pretty much like I would treat any person I hadn't seen in a while who pulled the juvenile stunt of coming to my house, waiting for me, sitting in my living room when I come back from work, and after treating me like a dish rag for months decided not to say a word to me. Actually, I treated him way better than that. I tried to make light conversation, and just asked someone else when he pretended he couldn't hear, see, or acknowledge me. He should be glad I didn't kill him there. He has no right to treat me the way he has, and then pretend it never happened . . . jeesh. I'm ripped. I am so angry, I hoped I wouldn't have to talk -- well, see -- him for like another month.

      What would you do if your closest confidant became your greatest critic? At first I did the wrong thing, I tried to change. You'll come to see though, that you can never reach what is continually placed above you. Then I did the right thing. You turn over a new leaf, and you become your own biggest fan, instead of your enemy - always trying to make yourself someone you're not. I actually forgot that I loved who I am. If you cannot love yourself, how can you love anyone else? You can't, you just suffer them under what you suffer yourself. If you are happy, those who love you will be happy. They won't try to make you into something else.

          Oh yes, Arne comes back tomorrow.   I was shocked when I realized it today. I had been waiting and longing and crying for this day, and it's just tomorrow, and I'm not even going to see him.   Things change. Not bad though, I think this is very good for me. I knew I had a lot to learn, I would have hoped there'd be an easier way . . .

          I talked to Alexis on Arne's windows messenger this morning. She is so funny, I got on at like eight thirty, (the only reason I was up then was because I was going to drive Solveig to the train station) and she sent like five messages before I got on saying "helllooo . . ." and that sort of thing. She wanted to talk to Arne apparently, and when I saw her tonight she still wasn't sure if it really had been me this morning even after we talked for an hour. I had thought Arne was trying to trick me when we started talking too, must have something to do with foreigners with exotic names :-) Okay, maybe nordic/scandinavian names. Then I drove Solveig to the train, I wonder if she said five words the entire time. Math test, nap, work . . . Courtney and Sarah came in, and we all talked for an hour (Them, me, Clair and Base), and Sarah got gas for me, which was awesome. I had to go to the youth group almost right after work, I just barely had time to eat and change, and then Eric dropped the car off right as I was about to get into Mike's car, and it had no gas in it. Then I was a little stressed about the time deal, but its okay for me to get gas because I drive the car all the time anyway. Then Sarah got it for me, just across the street, which was the sweetest thing. I realized I'd been really grumpy (not like I didn't have reason though) and I just felt like for me to walk around like that was hurting the people I love the most. Supper was really good, it was just the five of us. Which is crazy, because usually its the four of us or less. Eric was grumpy or something, but I guess he got over it. The youth group was fun, I got there and everyone asked me if I picked up Latifah and Yakira . . . which was stupid because no one told me to or even told anyone else to tell me to, they just decided I would. I of course didn't mind picking them up, because I really like them, but you know how it is. We did this scavenger hunt, which was cool, but I was tired from my day/week/month/summer/life, so I was happy to retire. I remembered the days driving home on the highway at night after spending a day with Arne. They're the best memories, I just felt so full, my life felt so full, I felt so loved. Feelings aren't everything. Like Eric said, there is immeasurable beauty in seeing reality. When we came home Eric gave us our gifts from Scotland. He gave me this stuffed little highland cow, which is the most adorable thing. He has long hair on his head, and the cutest little eyes. He gave me a picture of an actual one, because I'd never seen one before.  When you have kids, it's quite a responsibility. You have to make sure that even though you want to give them the best life ever and never let anything hurt them, you have to give them the correct amount of knowledge. Knowledge, like good and evil. You know the kind of person that thinks that everyone lives a life like theirs, and every person should cater to them? They are the same people that have been sheltered from ever having to work for their own cause. They think they are the only ones who feel pain, the only one they should live for. They have never met the reality of poverty, never seen that every story has two sides, never experienced the joy of denying yourself what you deserve to give to another person. Remember how Princess Diana would bring her sons to meet homeless people? Sick people, orphans. She didn't want them to live in their self-centered bubbles, looking down upon other people. People who may work harder, people who don't get everything given or handed to them. More people need to be able to say they are spoiled. Not more people need to be, more people need to know they are, and have some compassion for those who aren't. You ever met the kind of person I described? Who will take immensely from you, thinking you owe them, when they owe you a million times more?   Then have you met the person who smiles when they can make someone else smile? Love gives. Love gives everything. But don't give your all to the person who thinks you owe them. Find someone who is kind and caring and who will give to you in return.

          Choices. Important. I decided that its my own fault if I let someone else take my happiness. I'm going to be happy no matter who is there with me. Or isn't there. Or is driving me nuts. It's my life, and I'm going to live it to the fullest no matter what goes on around me. I went swimming tonight at Kingston State Park. I had only been swimming once before this summer, and there was this bathing suit I wanted but my mom said I only been swimming once this summer, so I didn't need another one. I was going to buy it, but it was fifty dollars on sale. I've been dying to go swimming again, and I'm more likely to get to the lake than the ocean, so I went there. It was so fun. It was amazingly beautiful. When we got the water I remembered that was where I hit my eye on a stump. I was two or three and I walked into a stump. I was wearing a patch so I couldn't see it. We went home and got a band-aid, and then went and swam. My dad was upset when he came home, and he took me to the hospital. We used to go there all the time when we were little. I crawled right into the water. I just tried to drink it. I've always loved swimming, I've been missing it a lot. It's a really nice place down there, with the common, and then the park, it's really beautiful. I talked to Sarah today, she is so nice. She was really understanding of my difficult week. I really enjoyed having an actual conversation with someone, who cares and talks to you. Like last night, my parents went to bed, and I was sitting at the kitchen table talking to Eric. I was staring at a picture of Mike, Mom and me on Mike's birthday and I started crying. Eric asked me what was up, and he gave me a hug and asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I said no, but I ended up telling him all about my Arne fiasco. He listened and he understood. Most people are just shocked that its not simple to work out, which makes me feel like I must be at fault for that. He knew what it was like, and he cared had empathy for the pain I was suffering. Today was a really beautiful day. I'm so glad I have a good job I can go to, and a wonderful home filled with a loving family to come home to. I just need to remember my dreams, remember I am to be unique, not a shadow of anyone. God created me to be exactly this way, sensitive this way, to think this way. I have a beautiful wonderful life, and I'm not going to let any rotten apple ruin the bushel. Bad things happen, and if you don't let them, they won't take away from the good things. They make the beautiful things in life stand out.

      Each day is new. Each day is a gift and a blessing. Each person holds so much power, but only over themselves. That is the ultimate power, though. Work was fun today. The baker came in early and kept giving me donuts he had made. I watched him make them and had just thought, those things are so bad for you!! But they do taste wonderfully, and I knew at least Mike would love them. I felt a little lonely, so I was so glad he came in, "Barbie," he would say, "Come pick a donut!" He gave me a glazed stick, a cherry cake, and a honey dip. He turned on the radio when he came in, which was so funny. This little old Lebanese man listening to Kiss 108 pretending to dance around. Avril's song "My Happy Ending" came on, and as I listened to it I thought that was really how I'd felt, if not how I was feeling then. Tonight was wonderful. I came home from work and my dad was so happy about the donuts. His eyes were huge when he told my mom about the taste, they were warm, and the smell! I had chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes, and ketchup of course, the one I picked out at Shaw's near Acopolco's. It was in a display but I wanted ketchup so I took it. Then mom, Mike and I watched the end of wrestling, it was funny. We were talking about getting along with people or lack of it really, and then my dad came in and we all talked more. We were talking about our Spikey, and Mike said there was one picture he'd wanted to see that he hadn't yet. It was the winter of 2001 or '02, and he was tied up near the basketball hoop. One morning I woke up and I looked at him out there, and he had climed on top of the barrel out there, and was curled up sleeping. There was about six inches of water because of ice melting, and he never liked to get wet. So he improvised like a good dog. I took a picture from my window, and then I went outside and he had sat up, but I got him to lay down again, he was adorable. We found so many wonderful pictures, with wonderful memories. We laughed and laughed. There are just so many funny things to remember. Not to mention me mumping in Arizona and sleeping on a rock in Sedona . . . We eventually went to bed. I realized something though. Even though I had been tired, worn out, and irritated earlier, I did have my happy ending. I have a family who loves me and treats me right. I have thousands of wonderful memories and a billion more to look forward to. I had so many hopes and dreams, and I wish I could whisper to that scared little girl that not only was everything going to be alright, it would be wonderful. Yes Spike is dead. There is a season for everything. Time to be born and a time to die. A time to laugh and a time to cry. There's no need to be afraid of one season or another, the winters in our lives don't last forever. Each person can chose, each of us has the power, to happiness, to love, to peace. In the end, there will be nothing other than happiness, love, and peace.

      Spikey died last night. They were the first words I heard waking up this morning. My dad told me. I prayed he would not have to suffer another day, when I fell asleep to his pained cries last night. He couldn't get up, he couldn't move. I patted his head and gave him a kiss good bye last night. My dad covered him in a blanket when and my mom came home. He was in the same spot when Mike and Solveig came home, when I came home, and when my parents came home. When my mom saw he couldn't move she started to cry. He was in pain, too much pain. He had internal bleeding, some disastrous intestinal problem. It was all over his fur, I thought it was feces, but it was blood, probably both. The flies had not wasted their time leaving their mark on him, although I tried to clean him off. He loved to lean of things, people; when I came home from work yesterday evening he had gone as far as his leash would let him, to lay his head on the lawn mower. Many times when he escaped recently I was terrified he would not come back. It was based on reality. On my birthday I felt a twinge of pain because I felt that he would die while I was seventeen. I always dreamed of being Seventeen when I was a little girl. While Arne was in Germany I prayed that God would not take both my boy and my dog. Arne will return in a week, and I thank God. His timing is perfect. I didn't think he would die. I only started to think he could when my mom and dad came into my work and my mom told me that he couldn't walk well, his back legs dragged. That was one thing the Finny's said about Babe before she died. That worried me. He was so soft, so sweet. He was the best dog-friend a girl could ask for. He came to my first grade class. He always went on walks with me. He loved my boyfriend. He tried to bite Mark :-) They got over their differences, and really loved each other. Mark prayed for Spike the night he died, that he would not suffer. Spike went so quickly. Maybe a week ago he started whining a lot, last Thursday he threw up in the morning. Friday he had diarrhea, Saturday his backside, back legs, and tail were dark and stained. Sunday we wondered if he'd be okay. Monday when I looked at him, I cried. He cried too, he could not lay down without being in pain. He cried . . . when he tried to sit down, when he laid down, and when he stood. When he would lay down he would kind of fall. He was my dog and I didn't want him to be in pain. His back was hunched, he looked almost as bad as he felt. Monday we fed him the rice and beef the vet prescribed, he stood and barked at me when I came outside. Sunday night he just barked, yipped, whined and cried until at 2 AM Mike brought him in so the neighbors wouldn't riot. We weren't going to bring him in because he was a complete mess. My poor, poor dog. He died in his sleep. I hoped he would. We all hoped he would. His eyes were closed and his slightly open. My mom said he looked like a teddy bear. That night, I just cried when I looked at him. He was the most hyper, excited dog - and his only movement was the raising and falling of his chest. His eyes were so lifeless at first I thought he had already died. My parents and I ran downstairs because he started crying. My mom and I patted him. I just stared at my shaking hand on the side of his shoulder. I just wanted him to be alright, peaceful. Now he is. I didn't want to leave him, but I knew his last hours could be graphic. He bled a lot. He was so tiny when he was a puppy. He looked tiny next to me and I was pretty small. Spike Cosmos Army. He loved us and we loved him. We miss you, Spike.

       urlLink    Shannon and Arne  urlLink      I was single and proud of it. I didn't want a man, I didn't need one, and I didn't have a care for any man. I would say I met Arne and all of that changed, but at first I just wondered who he was. Then he just kept me awake at night because I could not get him out of my thoughts. I cried for an hour when he went home to Germany -- I didn't know why. The only thing that had changed was I cared about a man. Then we talked for hours on IM. I felt myself falling in love with him, and I didn't know what to do. I still didn't need a man. But I wanted him. I wanted to talk to him all hours of the day. He was charming, he was sweet, and he was real. He was a man like no other. He had morals and convictions; which although I had the same ones, I could not understand him having them. I was surprised he wanted to talk to me so much, I was surprised I found him so intriguing and funny. I was shocked he was so open and vulnerable. I had walls up for miles, and although he had been hurt more times than I could imagine, he opened himself up to me. There was one point, we had become close, he was open and I could see he really cared about me. At that moment, I knew I would either push him away as I had done to every other man, or I would accept and love whatever person his blonde, six-foot frame contained. I knew it would be easy and natural for me to push him away and never give him another thought. For once, for the only time, it was different. This was not just some guy trying to get me. He cared about me, and there was something between us . . . something I'd never experienced before. We completed each other, we had something the other desired and wanted. At that point, I needed him. So although it was new and uncomfortable, I made a decision that I knew I had to stick by. A decision I knew I would need to explain and that may cost me. Perhaps very much.  Love is stronger than death, it's jealousy unyielding as the grave.  That's a blessing and a curse, but I was yet to find out.    He started coming to church. He became a Christian. Kristina plastered me with questions, do you like him? Do you think he's cute? You guys do look really cute together . . . We tried to hide it, I was embarrassed. Soon everyone knew. No one mocked me, no one told me I'd gone against my word. Everyone was happy for me, everybody was interested in us. We had our ups and downs, but we loved each other. I had the constant thought of him going away. Which he eventually did. He gave me his ring, which he always wore. I was shocked, I didn't think he would, but when he did, I knew he would come back to me. He will be gone for as long as we were together. The time is just about over. We had our ups and downs, too many. He eventually did something that really hurt me, and it was more than enough for me to make a change. I know I hurt him, too. I wasn't myself for him, I never showed him what I was really thinking because I didn't want to hurt him.  This way still hurts.  He is my hero, have you ever lost a hero?  Yet we decided that we need to take a break and get some healing. We still love each other, and I am as enamored with him as ever. We want to learn to have a friendship, then see if we can build upon a firm foundation. All I want is a healthy relationship that will last forever. The man of my dreams . . . don't let me lose him.
