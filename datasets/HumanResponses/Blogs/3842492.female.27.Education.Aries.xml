       Me again...To start off with I am a little pissed because I just wrote this whole, long, (beautifully written&nbsp;if I do say so myself)&nbsp;blog...and the bloody computer logged off before I could publish it and know I have to stay here and re-type it.&nbsp;Poo! I will see if I can re-write what I had before, let's see...It's a lot easier to get on the net here in Lonodn then in Barcelona...yet twice as expensive.&nbsp; But just wanted to keep ya'll updated on my adventures here in London.&nbsp;       Yesterday,&nbsp;I went to Kensington Place (where Princess Diana used to live), which is located in&nbsp; Hyde Park.&nbsp; It is very beautiful castle and inside they had some gowns of Princess Diana's on Exhibit.&nbsp; I stayed in the park for lunch and went to the Kennsington Gardens which where spectacular  .&nbsp; After that I went home for lunch and took a lill nap...which ended up being a loooong nap. When I finally woke up, it was late and most places close here around 5pm.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I went to take a night walk along the river...it was very nice. I was going to see a movie...but it got too late, so&nbsp;I just went back to the apartment and caught up on my 'Big Brother'. It is a really bad show...the house is ugly, their accents are annoying...they basically sit around and do nothing or else they are doing these dumb challenges...BUT I am hooked.&nbsp; Tonight the house finds out that one of their house mates used to be a man!!!   Can't wait!     &nbsp;   I got up earlier today because I wanted to go on the Lonodn Eye but I refuse to stand on the long 'Disney-esc' type lines.&nbsp; So I got on the bus and was&nbsp;in Westminster by 10am.&nbsp; I bought my ticket and got on line for a ride on the London Eye. For those of you who don't know what it is...it's bascially this huge ferris wheel made up of 32 enclosed glass-capsules that hold about 25 people each and reaches a height of about 435 ft. It is on the bank of the Thames River, right by the Parlaimnet buildings and over looks all of London.&nbsp; They built it for the Millenium celebrations and it was suppose to only stay up anf running for 5 years...but has been such a tourist attraction that they decided to keep it going for little longer.&nbsp; I was really excited to go on and had my camera already...the wheel really never stops and you have to hop on while it is turning, a full ride is one complete turn on the wheel and last about 30 mins.&nbsp; I hopped on and ran right up to the glass so I could get a good view.&nbsp; We went up slowly and&nbsp;I took some pics of the riverside...and up,up we went and I took some pics of Big Ben, and up,up we went and i got some pics of the city landscape...And that's when I looked down...whoa.&nbsp; I got a little dizzy and stepped back from the edge...we were pretty high up now and I wanted to take pics but I was scraed to go right up to the edge...which i know is silly because we are totally in this enclosed capsule and totally safe and I just tried chalking it up to just a bit afraid of heights, i didn't hink I would be so nervous close to the edge&nbsp;...but just the idea of walking up to the glass and looking around made me a lil queazy.&nbsp; Not to mention that there was this little snot-nosed kid running around the capsule, climbing up the glass and the hand railings. &nbsp;I was like, this little spawn of satan is going to break something and we are all going&nbsp;to plummet into the brown mirky depths of the Thames River to our deaths.&nbsp; He was making me very nervous, not to mention it was hot as hell in the capsule.&nbsp; It looks so high tech that you would never guess that it wouldn't be air conditioned...well, actually it does have some a/c trickling out from this miniscule vents... but seriously, we pay a pretty 'pence' to go on this contraption, they could at least pump some&nbsp;cool air&nbsp;into this puppy.&nbsp; But my mind was soon put to easy when the little devil ran smack into the glass and nearly knocked himself out...so i didn't have to worry about that little runt anymore.&nbsp; It is really nice up on the wheel, I think I got a lot of nice pics.&nbsp; You don't really feel it moving and it doesn't really feel like 30 mins...it went by quickly. &nbsp;  I defiently recommend it to anyone who comes to London and you can save a bit of time if you pre-oder&nbsp;you tickets on line and pick them up there.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   After my ride on the London Eye&nbsp;I hopped over to the London Aquarium.&nbsp; It was very nice. Larger then the aquarium in Barci but still not as nice as my favorite aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland.&nbsp; They had all the usual tropical fish (still my favs), sharks, seahorses, and a touch tank were I got to pet a ray.&nbsp; It was nice and relaxing.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Next, I went to the Dali Museum which is right there.&nbsp; And something weird happened... At the Tate Modern I rented a audiorecorder that explained to you all the different exhibits. Well the guy at the rental desk was writing down my driver lisence info and asked me if I spoke Spanish...I replied,  un poco  and he asked where I was from...long story short he was from Bogota,Colombia...and let me just tell ya,&nbsp;he was a looker...heehee, we had a freindly exchange of words and it was nice.&nbsp; Well, when I went to the Dali Museum I also rented an audiorecorder and the guy who was at the rental desk was a cutie... when he was jotting down&nbsp;my info. he asked if I spoke spanish...I was like,ummm... yeah, un poco.&nbsp; So&nbsp; longer story short,he too was from Colombia...I was like do you have a brother that works at the Tate and he was like no...why? heehee.&nbsp; I thought that was funny,strange but funny.&nbsp; What is it, the only job for Colombians here is to be audiorecorder hander-outers?&nbsp;   Anyhoo,   the mesum was great. They have a large collection of Salvador Dali's work,including some scultpures that feature his famous melting clocks...it was pretty cool and very interesting.&nbsp; Dali was a pretty strange guy, he even used his long mustache to apint with occasionly...When you first entered the museum,you had to enter through these huge doors into a dark,black hallway, lit up by several blacklights... a little&nbsp;eerie.&nbsp; Along the walls are werid pics of Dali and different quotes by him...I walked down the hall slowly, I&nbsp;was the only one there and it was very quite except for the strange recording of sounds played in the background.&nbsp; If anyone was behind me they would have probaly thought that my slow movement was do to the fact that I was engrossed&nbsp;in the quotes and pics of Dali but in fact I was  scarred , I kept thinking that something was going to jump out and grab me.&nbsp; I wasn't sure if I had walked through the right door (kind like Alice through the Looking Glass) I was thinking, Is this an art museum or a house of horrors?&nbsp; But soon, to my relief, I exited the scarry hallway into to the art gallery and strolled through various sculptures,etchings,painting,and furniture done by Dali.&nbsp; There was also a small exhibit of Picasso's early&nbsp;work.&nbsp; It was very nice and I enjoyed it.     &nbsp;   Next, I swung by some of the popular buildings in the area.&nbsp; The Houses of Parliment, Westminster Abbey,West Minster Cathedral, and Trafalgar Square.&nbsp; Took some pics and went to have lunch.&nbsp; I had to change some more of my money&nbsp; because&nbsp;I ran out.&nbsp; I am doing more then I ever did in Barcelona but I am also going through money more quickly.&nbsp; And the museums here don't really charge admission...go figure.&nbsp; I save all my receipts and keep track of my spending..so far I am glad to say that I have spent only about $700.&nbsp; Not to bad for like a month abroad..of course that is not counting airline tickets and apartment rental.     It's starting ti get dark, I think I will try to swing over to Buckingham Palace and stroll around that area and then home again, home again jigady-jig.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Tomorrow I am going to head over ealry to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge.&nbsp; After that I am going to swing up to Notting Hill and check out Portabella Road.&nbsp; Tomorrow night my dad's aunt is taking me out for dinner and to do a lilttle dancing...I have tried to explain to her that I am a white girl, muy americana , and don't dance...but she seems convinced that once i here the music and get a few drinks in me I will be slasing with the rest of them.&nbsp; But i figure I will go, she has been very nice to me letting me stay in her apartment... she lives close to everything and it is free, that is the best part in a city that everything is so expensive. &nbsp;    Saturday is my last day...boohoohoo. I love London and have had a grat time here.&nbsp; It felt so at ease from the moment I got here.&nbsp; I defiently like it and am a little persuaded to maybe start my summer here next year...who knows well, see. &nbsp;  I am having a blast in London but am kinda excited to be going back to Barci.I miss my lil apartment and   my sisters and mimi will be coming soon.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Well, off I go...Cheers!

      I had an amazing night yesterday.&nbsp; I went to see a performance of Much Ado About Nothing at the Shakespeare Globe Theatre...and it was brilliant!  I started off the day by taking at stroll down Kensington Road.&nbsp; I found an internet cafe and spent a pretty penny updating my blog.&nbsp; Then I hoped on the tube... and was off to Southwark.&nbsp; The rail system and bus system are so easy here.&nbsp; Everything is well labeled and there is always someone around to ask just in case.&nbsp; I got off at the Mansion House Station and proceeded to walk to the theater. There were signs pointing the way and&nbsp;I basically just followed them, but I must have missed a turn or something...so before I knew it, I found myself walking in circles.&nbsp; Then this guy came up to me and asked me if I knew where the nearest underground station was.&nbsp; Since I at least knew the direction in which I came from I pointed him in the right direction and gave him an extra&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;a map of the tube system.&nbsp; I asked him if by chance he knew where the Globe Theatre was, he was like, yeah,&nbsp;I was just there...so one lost soul helps out another.&nbsp; By the time I got there I was a bit tired of walking in circles.&nbsp; But I have been dying to see this since I've seen the movie Shakespeare in Love, so I went on a tour and loved it.&nbsp; It isn't the original theater, b/c that burned down during a performance, but they rebuilt it to look identical to the original.&nbsp; It was very cool.&nbsp; I bought a ticket to the 7.30pm performance for £5.&nbsp; It's the poor man's ticket.&nbsp; You have to stand in the yard for the whole performance.&nbsp; But the seats where so much more expensive and I figured I'd rest up before it.&nbsp;  I&nbsp;had a couple of hours before the show, so I walked along the Thames River.&nbsp; There were street performers and people sitting, walking, riding bikes...it was nice.&nbsp; I then went to the Tate Modern.&nbsp; It is an art gallery like non I have been to.&nbsp; It is in the enormous warehouse building.&nbsp; It has its exhibits by subjects, such as Still life, Nude, History and Memory.&nbsp; And in there collection the have all the big name artists like Dali, Matisse, Pollock, and Picasso...just to name a few.&nbsp; I rented (for only £2 and admission is free) a telephone looking device that gives you info on the exhibits as you go.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; They had this amazing exhibit of motion art...there was this room you entered and it had this capsules you stood in that would change colors...it was absolutely amazing.&nbsp; I got to see some of my favs... Surrealist and impressionist...Loved it!&nbsp; I hit the gift shop..and was off to the show.&nbsp;  On the way to the show there was this young, cute guy signing opera music on the boardwalk.&nbsp; I stopped and listened for a bit...He was very good.&nbsp; As I left I dropped my change that I had in my pocket into his hat...only a few pence really.&nbsp; I wanted to get on queues (on line) for the show early so I would be close to the stage.&nbsp; But I had to call my aunt and let her know that I wasn't coming home till late...that's when I realized I gave that street singer guy the rest of my change.&nbsp; Damn!&nbsp;Some places here are tight about giving change and I was low on British money....(I have to change more money today), in the end I had to wait on a long line at Starbucks to get change to make a 30 pence call.&nbsp; But I finally I got to the theater and waited on line.&nbsp; Everyone was sitting down waiting...all knowing that for the next 3 hours we would be standing.&nbsp; There were like 20 people in front of me, so I wasn't late or anything.&nbsp; When the guy came to open the doors he ask that there would be no pushing, shoving and trampling over one another...I was thinking to myself, what is he talking about...but when he opened the door people were in a rush to get up to the stage.&nbsp; You see if you are in the front you can lean on the stage.&nbsp; I followed the girl in front of me and the front of the stage filled up right away, so I ran to the side...I was right up at the stage.&nbsp; It was so cool.&nbsp; before the show I talked to this girl next to me from who is from Westchester...She's 21 and traveling with a friend...a bit of a geek, but I enjoyed talking to someone.&nbsp; I also talked to this nice British couple next to us.&nbsp; The where so cute and where telling me of all the great places I have to see before I go.&nbsp; Then the show started.&nbsp; It was being performed by a cast of all women actors.&nbsp; When I first heard that I was a little disappointed...I mean there would definitely be no Keanu reeves among them...but they were great.&nbsp; Some of them you couldn't actually tell where women.&nbsp; Which I think is a little frightening.&nbsp; I would hope that even with short hair makeup, I&nbsp; would still not be able to look so much li,ke a man.&nbsp; Actually at one part of the show, one of the actors had to stop the show b/c someone in the audience wasn't well and they escorted her out, and they worked it into the play...it was great.&nbsp; The show was amazing.&nbsp; It was hysterical,&nbsp; the whole audience laughed and of course dramatic and sad...I mean this is Shakespeare.&nbsp; we had a 15 min intermission which I sat down and rested my piggies for.&nbsp; The nice British couple offered me some of their wine and I sat there and ate my sandwich and we chatted.&nbsp; It was something about seeing a play in an open theater in that atmosphere, you get sucked into it...The whole night was excellent...I was like on cloud nine when I left.&nbsp; I caught the tube...Jumped on my bus and was home by midnight.  All in all I had a outstanding time.&nbsp; If I get a chance I might even see another play...Measure by Measure...   Well, today I am off to Kensington Place and to visit the Princess Diana Memorial.&nbsp; Then I have a bit of walking a head of me.&nbsp; Not sure what I am going to do tonight..but I guess I'll just wing it.   Having a terrific time in London, wish you were all here...Miss you...   What I have noticed since I have been in London...  1. They sell Cadbury chocolates in vending machines everywhere.&nbsp; I don't know why this struck me as being so different...they love that chocolate here and these vending machines are like EVERYWHERE!   2.&nbsp; The police here are  not  cute at all.&nbsp; They all look too young or too old.&nbsp; They have to where funny looking hats.&nbsp; Next to my Barci's cops, they don't stand a chance.   3. Here the have a system kind of like our Metrocards.&nbsp; You can use them on the buses and the trains.&nbsp; When you get on a bus you usually just flash the card at the driver.&nbsp; When you go into the tube you slide it into a slot and it pops out the top of the machine.&nbsp; you snatch it and these lil doors open.&nbsp; So I thought exiting would be like in New York.&nbsp; I walked up to the gates and... Nothing the wouldn't open.&nbsp; I tried pushing this yellow pad thing they had on the machine and...nothing.&nbsp; There must be some password, trick hidden button...So I couldn't get out of the tube station.&nbsp; I had to steep back and&nbsp; pretend to tie my shoe, when I saw someone slide their card in the machine to open the doors...Oops.&nbsp; So that's how you get out...easy peasy&nbsp;:)

      Hello old chums,  So I have arrived safe and sound in lovely London.&nbsp; A LOT has happened since I last wrote so I will try not to leave anything out.   I left Sunday morning at the butt crack of dawn.&nbsp; I had to catch a cab around 5.30 am but I was nervous that I would sleep through the alarm, so really I only got a few hours of shut eye.&nbsp; I got my stuff and shlept it to grab a taxi.&nbsp; At 5:30 in the morning I didn't expect to see many people out but there were loads of kids going home from&nbsp; los discotecas .&nbsp; Got to the airport in a flash, since there was no traffic.&nbsp; My flight was aboard EasyJet, it reminded me a lot of Spirit or Airtran.&nbsp; We had reserve numbers and I had no idea what that was, all I knew was that I was 98 and that couldn't be a good thing.&nbsp; Well, everyone started to line up before the flight was announced, so I just got online.&nbsp; That is where I saw the hottest guys.&nbsp; I was right behind them online.&nbsp; They were American, and I guess they were on holiday from London were they go to school...Oxford I think, well, at least that is as much as I got for totally easedropping on their convo.&nbsp; Then I heard this beeping and it kept continuing.&nbsp; The man next to me thought it was his cell phone and was searching for it.&nbsp; Well, it turns out it was coming from one of the guys in front of me.&nbsp; It kept beeping and was getting quite annoying.&nbsp; The Barci's around me were like, doesn't he hear it.&nbsp; So I tapped him on the shoulder and was like "excuse me but I think your beeping" Well, he turned around and was like, "Yeah, its my alarm clock, It's in my backpack somewhere and I can't find it".&nbsp; We talked for a bit about London and Barcelona and what we were dong this summer.&nbsp; And let me just tell you, I am surprised I could speak b/c I must have been drooling buckets...He was def.&nbsp;a cutie.&nbsp; I was wrenched from my convo with the&nbsp;cutie-pututie when they announced that they would be boarding reservation numbers 1-30.&nbsp; I was like great, I am going to be last.&nbsp; My hotties had earlier numbers, so I bid them adieu.&nbsp; Well, this flight was very different from any flight I have ever been on.&nbsp; Once you board you can sit where ever you like.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought was very strange.&nbsp; I got an aisle seat which was nice, I was afraid I would be stuck in the middle seat, which I absolutely dread.&nbsp; But I was no where near the hotties.&nbsp; The flight was quick... But cold...the air was full blast and I had on capris and a light sweater which thankfully I brought.   Landed in Gatwick London airport and I was suppose to meet my aunt at Victoria Station.&nbsp; The night before I phoned her to let her know my flight details and she was like well, when you get there get the train to Victoria station and I will find you there.&nbsp; I almost had an immediate panic attack.&nbsp; In my head I was like, "WHAT your not meeting me at the airport" I was nervous that I would be lost in London looking for an aunt I never even met before.&nbsp; Well needless to say the train was right there in the airport...Easy peasy.&nbsp; After I passed through customs, I purchased a train ticket and exchanged my money.&nbsp; That was upsetting.&nbsp; When ever I change my money the amount keeps getting smaller :(&nbsp; $1 us is about equal to 1.20 euro and here in London is equal to 1.80 £.&nbsp; So things here in London cost me just under double the amount.&nbsp;   So I got on the express train to Victoria on platform 9&nbsp; & 3/4,&nbsp; just kidding that is to Hogwarts ... heehee.&nbsp; The train took 35 mins and was nice.&nbsp; They served refreshments on a cart and it was very clean and a smooth ride.&nbsp; Gatwick is on the outskirts of London, so I went through some country type land.&nbsp;   Got to Victoria, no problem.&nbsp; Met my aunt, well actually my dads aunt so that would&nbsp;make her my great aunt? ...whatever.&nbsp; She is nice and has made London very easy.&nbsp; She had me buy a train and bus weekly ticket and it has been great.&nbsp; She took me to her apartment in Chelsea.&nbsp; She lives in an area called World's End.&nbsp; It is really cute area.&nbsp; Then we jumped on the bus to the south bank area, and Trafalgar Square and we walked around there.&nbsp; I saw almost everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lonodn Eye, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, you name it its right there.&nbsp; I took some pictures but I&nbsp;&nbsp;am going &nbsp;back there today to take more.&nbsp; She had to go to work at 4pm, and I was a little sleepy, so we went back to the apartment.&nbsp; I took a nap, and then later that night she showed me around some more sights.&nbsp; Saw the Piccadilly Circus, which I had no idea what to expect, basically it is London's version of Time Square.&nbsp; The term 'circus' I believe comes from the fact that there is a circular intersection- no lions or elephants, sadly.&nbsp; I went by Chinatown, Soho (which here is synonymous with sex shops, much different from our Soho), and saw Harrods (for those who haven't been here is like our Macy's and Bloomies in one, sorta)&nbsp; I saw so much, I can't even begin to list it all.&nbsp; There is really so much to see here that I think that even a week here I wont even be able to make a dent.&nbsp; But I have been trying my best.   The next day I took the bus, which is very convinent and very easy to use.&nbsp; I went to South Kensington and started my day at the Natural History Museum and Science Museum, they were free and I am such a science nerd, I go to every science museum where I travel :)&nbsp; They were very nice, took some pics and headed off to the Victoria & Albert&nbsp; Museum, which has a different collections, and a another nice collection of costumes done be famous designers.&nbsp; I was hungry so I didn't spend to much time there.&nbsp; I went to Harrods and bought lunch there.&nbsp;They have everything Macy's and Bloomie's has, and then they have this food court that is amazing.&nbsp; Nothing like what I expected, I expected to se the food court&nbsp;like in Roosevelt Field Mall...but the had fruit & veggie section, meat, fish,and pol;utry, a bakery, which by the way the biggfest attraction is Krispy Kreme, and Tapas, pizzeria, ice cream shop..you name it they have it there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next,&nbsp;I&nbsp;took a stroll&nbsp;around that area, which is like Fifth ave, with Burberry and Versace, just looking of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards I took a walk around Hyde park, and then took the bus home.&nbsp;   I could go on forever naming all I have seen just walking around and from the bus.&nbsp; But I gues you have to be here to experience it.&nbsp; My first impressions of Lonodn...LOvE it.&nbsp; I really don't know what it is.&nbsp; I guess I have always liked the idea of life in London, basically what I had picked up from maureen & laura and from movies,and books. It always seemed like my kinda place.&nbsp; It is a lot like Manhattan and even shares streets and areas with the same names...although I doubt we have a street called Threadneedle Street.&nbsp; I like that it has a city feel but not the crazy hecticness of New York.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, there are def. a lot of people here, especially in the touristy areas.&nbsp; But there is a different vibe here, and&nbsp;I like it.  Now about the weather. We have all heard about London and that it is always cloudy and rainy but, seriously what is up with the wether here?&nbsp; It is a little over 2 hours&nbsp;north&nbsp;of Barcelona and&nbsp;I figured it would be like going from LI to Rochester, with a little of temp difference.&nbsp; I knew it would be coller, but it is cold here.&nbsp; I am glad I bought a jacket and cardi.&nbsp; I have been wearing jeans and pants and although the sun is shinning now, in a couple of minutes it could be raining.&nbsp; There is a change in the weather all day long.&nbsp; I walk around and here everyone commenting on how sunny it is and how hot it is.&nbsp; And I can't believe it.&nbsp; I guess for them this is warm weather.&nbsp; In Barcelona I would never have dreamed of putting jeans on during the day ...I would have passsed out from a heat stroke.&nbsp; The difference in temperature is amazing.&nbsp; But I like this type of temperature, kinda reminds me of Cortland, more of a spring like temperatures.&nbsp;   The rest of London is like the movies you've seen.&nbsp; Double decker buses, funny looking cabs, driving on he opposite side of the road, tea, and funny accents.&nbsp; All in all I am having a great time exploring London.&nbsp; I feel a little more at ease here and touring around by myself hasn't been that bad.&nbsp; I have to go though...I want to catch some more sights today...things here close a lot earlier then I am used to.&nbsp; In barcelona shops don't close till 10pm here the close around 6pm.&nbsp;  I will defenietly keep you updated and thanks for the suggestions of places to visit Laura...I will def. try to get to as many as possible.&nbsp;   Tidbits I have picked up since I have been in London.&nbsp;  1. They love gossip here.&nbsp; The have hundreds of those magazines that stalk stars and make up shit based on the articles.&nbsp; They are hilarious, but very mean also.&nbsp; They are very into start stalking.   2. Of course the hardest thing for me to get used to right now is the fact that they drive on the opposite side of the street.&nbsp; It is hard to break the habit of looking one way to cross the street and now you have to look in the opposite direction.&nbsp; What Londoner are clever people and so the have written on&nbsp; street corners look left or look right....Pretty cool I think.&nbsp; With out that I would have surely already been London roadkill.   3.&nbsp; Here in London it is forbidden to feed pigeons.&nbsp; They are trying to reduce the numbers if not get rid of them.&nbsp; There is a campaign to eradicate these 'rats with wings' as Mayor Ken Livingstone's affectionately calls them.&nbsp; maybe New York should follow there example.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;4.&nbsp; They are obbessed with the show 'Big Brother'.&nbsp; I never have seen it before but its on like all the time and people talk about it like they know the people.&nbsp; Its funny.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Well, let me just&nbsp; say that I didn´t realize that I hadn´t updated my blog recently...I could swear I did...you all must be dieing with anticipation, wondering what&nbsp;I have been up to.&nbsp; Well it has been four days since I last wrote and of course a lot has happened, so I will just give you the highlights.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I went&nbsp;on a walk of one of the districts called&nbsp;el Barrio Gotico (Barri Gotic in Catalan) basically its the Gothic Quarters where all the buildings are built in the gothic style and are old :)&nbsp; it has narrow streets and lots of little stores...kind of reminds my of Harry&nbsp;Potter when he goes to Diagon&nbsp;Alley ...heehee.&nbsp; It was nice to see another part of Barcelona.&nbsp; I live in Eixample which is the newest part of Barcelona and looks&nbsp;more like Manhattan then any of the other parts here.&nbsp; The streets are set up in a grid like fashion and the newer building are found here.&nbsp;  I&nbsp;also went to&nbsp;a new park, took some pics and read a book...I was forced to buy to new books.&nbsp; I bought Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights...they were on sale&nbsp;and I can add them to my classics list :)   There was some commotion in front of my apartment on Thursday.&nbsp; I live off a busy street but I have noticed it does get&nbsp; bit of traffic.&nbsp; Well I was in my apt. preparing dinner...peas, pasta, white wine, and I heard screaming.&nbsp; I looked outside and these three women were attacking a man.&nbsp; I looked closer and I could see that the man had come from out of a van that was stopped now in the intersection and the was a stroller right in from of it.&nbsp; The man almost hit the woman and her child and the ladies were angry and scared and attacking this man.&nbsp; He really didn´t hit anyone, but the cops were called and it was a big scenes for like 2 hours in front of my apt.&nbsp; The cops here I have noticed are young and HOT!&nbsp; I don´t know if it is the uniforms or what but they are calander hot.&nbsp; I will sneak pics for you ladies if I can, :) I watched from my window, no more attempts by me to sneak a peek off the terrace. Lots of people stopped and watched, I guess rubber necking is a universal thing.&nbsp; Well anyway, it provided a change from the usual Frasier in Español.&nbsp;   Yesterday I went to the MNAC (which is the national museum of Catalonia Art)&nbsp; It was beautiful.&nbsp; It is in this amazing building that was built for the 1929 Word fair, I think.&nbsp; It looks like it should be a royal palace.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp; the base of Montjuïc so they have stairs and outdoor escalators you can take.&nbsp; Even though I didn´t do much climbing, it was still hot.&nbsp; But well worth the view at the end.&nbsp; I have so many pics that I was running out of memory on my card and I still had the museum and fountain show at night.&nbsp; The museum consisted of Romanesque and Gothic art.&nbsp; I am more Partial to the later gothic art, which painting are more realistic.&nbsp; The museum itself was ok, no Met of course, but a nice exhibit of Catalonian work, and it was cool and refreshing inside.&nbsp;   At night,&nbsp;I went to see the Font Magica de Montjuïc, it was so cool.&nbsp; It was is in front of the MNAC building where I had spent they day looking at art...I´l l get to that next.&nbsp; At 9:30 until midnight people come, sit and watch this huge fountain light show set to music...it is amazing! I had never seen anything like it.&nbsp; I thought I could watch it for hours, especially since their was a nice breeze and with the water spraying it made the night much cooler (did I mention we are in recorded&nbsp;braking heat...Great)&nbsp; There are also several other fountains surrounding it and you can walk along the grounds it is one of my favorite thins here in Barcelona so far, and it is only three blocks from my apartment.&nbsp; Really, it is something so beautiful everyone should see.&nbsp;  Afterwards I went home, it was late but I desperately had to do a load of laundry...so I "attempted" to use my cute lil euro washing machine.&nbsp; I read the instructions, put my clothes in, guessed where to put the detergent, and set the dial.&nbsp; Everything looked good...but it was taking forever...does one load really take that long.&nbsp; Well I have to admit, I never do laundry I really haven´t since college, heehee, but it always gets done. (must be the magic laundry fairies) Anyhoo, It was getting too late, and I didn´t want to piss off the people down stairs, so I attempted to speed things up by moving the dial along, Then the whole thing started bucking like a wild bronco...It was loud and scary and sounded like it was about to break into a thousand pieces...so I quickly shut it off. I was like, forget it, I´ll just take the out, wring them out and hang them out to dry.&nbsp; But the machine had other ideas.&nbsp; It held my laundry captive for more then 10 mins, while I pushed, pulled and yanked every possible part of that demonic machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally with a lil "pop" sound it opened up and I&nbsp;liberated&nbsp; my drenched clothes and hung them out on my terrace to dry.&nbsp; The clothes looked pretty clean and smelled super nice and were very soft.&nbsp; Oh yea, that's thanks to the fact that I think I washed my clothes in fabric softener only.&nbsp; I have no idea, it´s in Spanish but I can´t figure out if it is laundry detergent or softener, and I have come to the conclusion....it is softener...Oops.&nbsp; Oh well, It will have to do.&nbsp;   I finished my last load of laundry this morning.&nbsp; I had planned to do a little more sightseeing today...perhaps a craft fair in a plaza nearby...BUT it was so HOT today.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I was going to die!&nbsp; I know I´m bad with humidity but this is ridiculous.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can´t go anywhere without sweating buckets...as I am right now :)&nbsp; I did some walking, checked out some new places...you know the usual.&nbsp;   So know I have some big news.&nbsp; Well big for me.&nbsp; I am going to London, tomorrow.&nbsp; Yipeeee! Woooohoo! Yeah! I booked it yesterday.&nbsp; I am going for six days so I won´t be back to Barcelona till the 31st.&nbsp; I am so excited.&nbsp; I have wanted to go forever and walk around London, wearing a black peacoat saying " Hello, London"&nbsp;.&nbsp; But due to the heat I will have to abandon the peacoat part of my dream, for when the season is more appropriate.&nbsp; But I can´t wait.&nbsp; I have heard so many good things about London from Maureen, Laura and Erin...I have always wanted to go.&nbsp; Plus I so love British films and reading Sofie Kinsella books have put me in the mood to explore the sights.&nbsp; So I am off..I leave 7am(that´s if I don´t miss my plane).&nbsp; I have to go pack and see what I can squish into my bag...   I will definitely write to you all about my London adventures.&nbsp; Wish me luck!  Besos!   Some points I have picked up on while roaming the streets of Barci!   1: Barci´s don´t like to waste anything...especially energy in the form of air conditioning.&nbsp; Even the stores are just cool enough.&nbsp; Nothing like in New York where the sidewalks are even cool b/c of the air blowing out of places.&nbsp; Sometimes you can´t even find relief going into a store.&nbsp; There is no relief from the heat!   2: There are water fountains throughout the city.&nbsp; They have water that you can drink or wash your hands and stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are very pretty and add a nice touch to the city. There are also benches everywhere, and I know why, when your walking in this horrible heat you have a place to sit and try to cool down before passing out.&nbsp;   3:&nbsp; The Barci´s love to say "vale".&nbsp; I have been finding myself saying it more and more.&nbsp; It basically means, ok, yes, alright, true, etc...and is used all the time in conversation.&nbsp; Aaaah, I am turning into&nbsp;Barci!

      Well, I had a very interesting day yesterday.&nbsp; I have had a restricted diet here.&nbsp; Basically mornings consist of orange juice ( xumo  in Catalan) and a fruit, Lunch is usually a bocadillo (like a sandwich) and dinner peas & pasta if I stay home or something yummy when I go out.&nbsp; So I felt that I was lacking some necessary vitamins and calcium.&nbsp; Milk isn´t really popular here...I think they drink that Parmalat store shelf, would survive nuclear attack stuff.&nbsp; So I opted for a little diary in the form of cheese and yogurt.&nbsp; I had the yogurt for breakfast and started to get ready to go to the MNAC (Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) to check out some Dali, Picasso and El Greco among others.&nbsp; Then I heard a rumbling in my tummy.&nbsp; I´ll spare you all the gory details...but long story short my lactose deficiency kicked in and rendered me incapable of leaving the apartment for a good part of the morning.&nbsp; So I tried to make the best of being trapped in the apartment.&nbsp; I pulled out a chair to my lil terrace and read my book...(which I finished...I really wish I didn´t read so damn fast) it was pleasant alternative to the museum, which I think I will go to tomorrow.&nbsp; I need a good couple of hours of a/c and it´s really close to my apartment.   Last night there was some action on my lil  calle.&nbsp;  I was trying to get to sleep, it was like&nbsp;1 in the morning and I heard a VERY drunken man yelling...something about being back stabbed by someone he thought was his friend, something about never being able to trust him & that family again...he&nbsp; was banging on the door and kicking stuff over.&nbsp; I tried to ignore it but...I thought a little peek wouldn´t hurt so I rolled off the bed and crawled to the terrace and tried looking to where the action was...I thought I was being very stealth til I looked over and saw my neighbors all out&nbsp;on their terrace all staring at me b/c I was crouched down on my terrace...so I&nbsp;turned myself around and crawled back into bed.&nbsp; The man kept at it for a couple more minutes then He hoped on his moped yelled  ¡Conyo!  and was gone.&nbsp; I had a lot of trouble going back to sleep after that episode but have to admit it&nbsp;was rather entertaining, except for the whole being caught out by my neighbors&nbsp;bit :)   Tonight I am going to go to this water/lights show at that the Palau Nacional&nbsp;i Font Magica.&nbsp; It is three blocks from my house and looks to be very beautiful...it starts at 9:30 and goes till midnight. It is the at the base of Montjuïc, which is one of the mountains that surrounds Barcelona.&nbsp;I think translated&nbsp;it means Jewish mountain, in Spain...go figure&nbsp;It is I can see the lights from my apartment and I have been meaning to go...so I let you know how it goes tomorrow.&nbsp;   Nothing much else...sounds like not a lot but you know the usual walking around, sweating to death, looking at old and new buildings, checking out shops and dodging dog poo.&nbsp;   I end with some things I have learned while roaming the streets of Barcelona.  1: Tapas aren´t really big in Barcelona.&nbsp; They have several tapas bars but not the amount you would find anywhere else in Spain.&nbsp; I swear I am more Spanish then these&nbsp;Barci´s.   2:They have blockbuster here and my card works...I just have to give them a local phone # and address.   3: Erin asked if the keyboard here was different.&nbsp; I thought this was I very interesting question and something some of you also may be wondering.&nbsp;&nbsp;The keys are basically the same...letters in the same place- so that must be universal...but they do have different special keys like&nbsp;ñ,&nbsp;ï,&nbsp;¿ ¡ Çª are just a few...   Laters!&nbsp;   &nbsp;P.S. Is it a bad sign when your sunburn bubbles up in to water blisters....yikes!&nbsp;

      Well today I spent the better part of the day at L´aquarium Barcelona.&nbsp; I love aquariums, they are so quiet and peaceful and in this case very well air conditioned.&nbsp; It is a very hot day and I was looking forward to a couple of hours with my aquatic friends and&nbsp;a lil a/c.&nbsp; The aquarium is located down in Port Vella, the oldest port in Spain.&nbsp; They have this amazing tube that travels through a shark tank...not as glamorous as Liz and Dowd´s shark experience in Atlantis, but it was really cool.&nbsp; Of course I was super-marine bio- nerd and went through all the exhibits&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;see how many of the sea creatures I could name by their common name  and  scientific name.&nbsp; I have to say for a person with the worst memory, I did fairly well.&nbsp; May favorite exhibit of course was the tropical tank, with the clown fish, blue tang and angel fish.&nbsp; They also had these amazing sea horses that&nbsp;mimic these elaborate pieces of seaweed.&nbsp;The shark tank was cool and a lil scary the whole time&nbsp;I kept thinking, what would happen if I fell into the tank.&nbsp; I bet the sharks would devour me and leave pieces of me floating everywhere.&nbsp; But then&nbsp;my mind was put to ease because these two divers&nbsp;came by&nbsp;swimming around the tank scrubbing the algae off the tanks walls like it was nothing.&nbsp; Those sharks were huge and they had lost of teeth...  &nbsp;  After going to the aquarium I walked back towards the apartment via La Rambla.&nbsp; It wasn´t as lively as it usually is...so I´m guessing that Monday is their off day.&nbsp; The flea market part of the street was off for the day but all the street entertainers were there.&nbsp; They consist of people spray painting themselves to look like different statues...I took some pics, some of them were really cool.&nbsp; A job I could never have.&nbsp; First you have to paint yourself, and wear this costume in the dead HEAT and secondly, you have to remain still and not talk, laugh or smile.&nbsp; Never could do that.&nbsp; There were also vendors selling all different types of pets.&nbsp; Like birds, turtles, chicks, ducks, hamsters, mice, fish...it was cool.&nbsp; I was tempted to buy a cute lil yellow chick but I remembered that chicks grown up to be eye scratching out chickens. So&nbsp;I passed.&nbsp; I bought some postcards so as soon as I figure out where the post office is you´ll be getting mail.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After that I went to this store called FNAC.&nbsp; I think it is a British owned chain.&nbsp; It´s like HMV at home, I guess.&nbsp; I went in to buy a book, I am desperate.&nbsp; I bought the wedding by Nicholas Sparks, and Emma by Jane Austen.&nbsp; I would have bought more but the English books are expensive here so I have to pace myself.&nbsp; usually I´m not one to buy books, but I am desperate here, I keep thinking of the fact that if I was home I would have already read so many books&nbsp;:(&nbsp; but I guess there are to types of seeing the world, one via by traveling and the other via books.&nbsp; I also looked up some travel books for London and Paris.&nbsp; I am thinking that I might check out some other places while I´m here.&nbsp; Both are short flights from here and not that expensive.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hold on wait...just been informed by the nice Barci next to me that my&nbsp;pants still have the tag on them.&nbsp; Ooops..thanks :/&nbsp; How embarrassing. I´ve been walking around all day with that stupid tag sticking out.&nbsp; I´m a mess.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyhoo, where was I...  Going to end tonight with a romantic dinner at the cafe down the road from my apartment...in case your wondering, I will be dining alone.&nbsp; I have gotten better at that...I also haven´t gotten better at keeping myself company, I frequently find that I am talking to myself..wait isn´t that a symptom of insanity?&nbsp; Still haven´t met anyone but am making more of an effort everyday.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, tomorrow consists of a couple museums and of course a lil shopping.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  toodles!  &nbsp;  Things I have learned&nbsp; since I have been in Barcelona.  1: Here, when you greet someone, you kiss them twice, once on each cheek.&nbsp; Very Euro.  &nbsp;  2: I finally learned my address.&nbsp; It is  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consell de Cent 49 bis 3º 2ª  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;08014, Barcelona  (I am not sure if that is how you write it , but I think so.&nbsp; 49 is my building, I live on the third floor in the second apartment.&nbsp; You may have to put España on it somewhere but who knows) So if you were thinking of showering me with gifts to remind me of how much you miss me, now you can :)  &nbsp;  3: I finally found the culprit to that squeaking sound that was driving me insane while I was trying to watch the tele.&nbsp; It sounds so clear I thought it was coming from my apartment.&nbsp; I was running around the apartment...which is like running in circles b/c it´s so small...checking all hinged objects trying to figure out where the damn squeaking noise was coming from..when low and behold it figured it out.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is from the door of the restaurant across the Street.&nbsp; Can´t do anything about it, was thinking of dropping off a can of WD-14 but I guess I´ll just have to live with it.&nbsp;

      So after reading over my last blog, I had a thought....and that was how pathetic I am that I am in this wonderful city and all I have to share is what is on what channel.&nbsp; So I kicked my ass into gear.&nbsp; As soon as I left the internet place I went for a walk down Las Rambles. It is a very famous street here b/c it is a live all day and all night.&nbsp; I went to an open flea market, a huge open food market, saw the Colom statue and then&nbsp;I bought a two day ticket on this tour bus they have here.&nbsp; So now I have more to share then I have time to.&nbsp; So I´ll just keep to the highlights.  &nbsp;  The tour bus, called Bus Turistic, is pretty cool actually, it would be perfect if every city had it.&nbsp; It is divided into two routes a southern one (blue)&nbsp; and a northern one (red).&nbsp; And it goes from one point of interest to another.&nbsp; Its one of those open top tour buses, which is nice b/c you can see the sights better and not so nice b/c you also get burned a lot faster...my charred epidermis can vouch for that :(&nbsp; You can get off at any stop and there is a bus that passes by like every 5 mins.&nbsp; So it works out great.&nbsp; I went on both routes between yesterday and today and I saw everything.&nbsp; I didn´t get to go to all the places but&nbsp;I have a lot of time and&nbsp;I can see each place individually.&nbsp; I got to see the Olympic Village, some famous building by Guadi, the beach, the different barios of Barcelona, the Park Guell as well as other sites too much to mention.&nbsp; I´ll give you more detail as&nbsp;I visit each place separately.&nbsp; But overall this city is beautiful and very different from any other city I have ever been to.&nbsp; Even Madrid.&nbsp; I kind of thought that they would be the same...since they are both the largest cities in Spain.&nbsp; But Barcelona like to think it is it´s own country.&nbsp; The speak Catalan, hate bullfighting and are friendlier and more laidback&nbsp;then people in Madrid.  &nbsp;  There were people from all different places.&nbsp; I chatted with folks from Sweden, Ireland, and lots of Italians.&nbsp; For the most part people kept to themselves...maybe the glow radiating from my burned skin scarred them off.&nbsp; I tell you what scarred me off, this one guy had the most offensive body odor.&nbsp; I was happy that there was a free seat on top of the bus, so I ran right up. And as soon as I sat down I was knocked out by the toxic odor escaping from his armpit.&nbsp; And he had his arm around his girlfriend and she was event passing out.&nbsp; I should have known, it was to good to be true...its like on the LIRR or subway, whenever the train is packed and you run by one car that has seats...you know there is no air on or something.&nbsp; But needless to say I survived and am here to live another day.&nbsp; I also witnessed a girl with the longest armpit hair I have ever seen.&nbsp; It was a scary sight.  &nbsp;  Other then that,&nbsp; have been up to the usual.&nbsp; Walking, shopping, and taking in the sights.  &nbsp;  I went to Las Rambles tonight by mistake, actually I was trying to get here, but I took the worng street and before I admitted to myself I was lost and about to consult the map I saw swarms of people and the port so I knew where I was.&nbsp; I strolled up Las Rambles taking in the night excitement.&nbsp; There lots of people in the street, street entertainers, and gigantic beers...not to self remember to go back and get own gigantic beer :)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As far as meeting people, no luck on that front yet.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I have made more of an effort.&nbsp; And some people approached me and said hi, but&nbsp; ignored them...It´s hard meeting the RIGHT people...seedy characters need not apply.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, it´s almost 12 here and I still have to get to the apartment an lather up on the aloe.&nbsp; Was going to head to the beach tomorrow but I am afraid my skin might fall off so I am going to take a day off and maybe check out some sunday activities.&nbsp; But like always I´ll let you know.  &nbsp;  And for those of you who are reading this and have some vacay days stacked up, there is no excuse not to visit...I have the place all you need is the ticket...so let me know ;)  &nbsp;  So I´ll just end with tid bits I have learned since I have been here.  1. Phramacies are recognized by neoen green and red crosses and outside each one there are&nbsp; vending machines that sell condoms...just in case.  &nbsp;  2. The Barci´s have a fine appreciation for good television, I just caught my first spanish dubbed episode of FELICITY... I know, I know, this city IS to good to be true.  &nbsp;  3. Pot, Mary Jane, Marijuanna, weed, etc.&nbsp; is illegal to bu, sell and carry but legal to smoke in the privacy of your own home...go figure.&nbsp; Oh by the way I only know this b/c I saw people on the street smoking it and I asked my moms friend :)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Well, I have good news and&nbsp;I have bad news.&nbsp; The good news is that I found an internet place that is dirt cheap (1 euro an hour) and closer to my place. The bad new is that it is so cheap b/c they have no A/C.&nbsp; I just got here and&nbsp;I am sweating like&nbsp; a pig.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did&nbsp;I &nbsp;also fail to mention that the key board is coated in years of grim btwn the keys...I am getting skeeved just looking at it. But I guess that is the price I have to pay in order to keep my friends well informed.  &nbsp;  It´s 3 pm write now and it is hot as hell outside.&nbsp; Well, actually it´s not so much that its hot but the humidity is killer.&nbsp; It started getting hot around late last night.&nbsp; I woke up in the middle of the night and my Pj´s were sticking to me it was so hot.&nbsp; So I got up and turned the A/C on.&nbsp; And went back to bed.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I woke up this morning&nbsp;I could here a dripping sound but couldn´t figure out where it was coming from.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;I saw ice&nbsp; and a huge puddle of water on the floor behind the coach.&nbsp; I guess the A/C was on overload or something and it was malfunctioning or something...who knows.&nbsp; All I know is what ever is wrong with it, I didn´t do it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It´s siesta time and pretty much all the stores are closed.&nbsp; And I think it´s friday (I always lose track of the days when I´m on vacay), so they pretty much closed for the night if not the whole weekend.&nbsp; Shopping about, still need a good pair of walking shoes.&nbsp; My old navy flip-flops aren´t cutting it and they almost got me killed yesturday.&nbsp; Wait let me start the story of, The day&nbsp;I almost broke my neck in front of a resturant full of people in Barcelona, from the beginning.&nbsp; Yesturday late afternoon, while&nbsp;I was strolling down the street by my house...Carre Tarragona... taking in the breath taking arcitecture of Barcelona... I noticed, rather did not notice, that the entire sidewalk had just be hosed down by one of the resturants.&nbsp; If you know anything about flip-flops on a wet tile surface, you might know where this story is leading.&nbsp; I sorta slipped slightly on the wet tile. So I tried walking carefully.&nbsp; I swear my flip-flops went into hovercraft mode and&nbsp;I found myself recreating the scence in Bambi, when&nbsp;Bambi tries to walk on ice... (and not just for fun like Liz likes to do)... needless to say, my amazing balance kept my feet on the ground, but I did get some looks from some of the Barci´s eating dinner.&nbsp; An experience I do not wish to relive, so I am currently in the market for no hydo-gliding foot appreal.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I went to a couple of art galleries and cool funky stores by where I live yesturday.&nbsp; I guess you could describe the area&nbsp;I live in (Eixample) like Soho in the city... artsy but expensive.&nbsp; Just looking since everything is so expensive.&nbsp; I also am looking for these cool bags everyone has here.&nbsp; But I have been to a hundred different shops and haven´t seen any yet.&nbsp; Then I spent the rest of the time "planning" on where I am going to go. I realized that I do a lot of planning and less doing.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I decided to set goals for each day.&nbsp;My goal for today is to get my ass on the Bus Touristic and tour the north end of the city.  &nbsp;  I was going to go on a bus tour yesturday but the weather didn´t look so good.&nbsp;&nbsp; And since I don´t understand&nbsp;a word they are saying on the TV, b/c the official language of Barci´s is Catalan, I have no idea what the weather is and what´s going on in the news.&nbsp; I am however well versed in every WB series in Spanish.&nbsp; Its funny to hear how the dub people voices.&nbsp; I mean they must actually search for poeple with high pitched,&nbsp;sqeaking voices.&nbsp; I have about 10 channels give or take and some of them are entirely in Catalan.&nbsp; Then there is this channel FlaixTV, which plays International music, mostly American and British, but its like the same songs everyday.&nbsp; an any givenhour I can tell you what song is coming up next :)&nbsp; Then the other channels have futbol, Le tour de France and the same news hour after hour.&nbsp; I have been following Eurojuniors, which is like startsearch in Spain.&nbsp;   But TV is boring and I have no more books to read, so I guess that good b/c it forces me to actually leave the apartment.&nbsp; I do a lot of people watching in the park by my house.&nbsp; I bring my small sketch book and pretend to be sketching the trees or something.&nbsp; But really I´m checking out the people.&nbsp; There is something different about the poeple here.&nbsp; Fashion is basically casual and you don´t see the mini mini´s, or thong showing and same fashion that you see at home.&nbsp; It´s more of casual cottons and linens.&nbsp; A lot of the ladies here where those scarves in that euro knot.&nbsp; And the guys where jeans or khakis and sandals.&nbsp; Which I love.&nbsp; The style reminds me a lot of the guys in Wilmington.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh...Wilmington.   I got a phone, finally.&nbsp; Here is the number...but it´s like on a calling card and the minutes are expensive, so really it´s only for emergencys.&nbsp;actually, if you want the number email me and i´ll send it to you.&nbsp; I don´t want strangers calling me.&nbsp;  Sorry I don´t have more to share, but atlast since I have not ventured out I have no fun&nbsp;adventures to recall.&nbsp; Maybe I will stop by later tonight after I go on my bus tour.&nbsp;   Well, I guess I better get back to the humidity and dodging crazy mopedist.  Adios!

      Hello again! Glad to see that you all enjoying my blog.  Thanks for the emails too.  I miss you all tons!  Glad to hear that the weather is crappy at home.  It warms my heart to know that I am having better weather then you guys :)   Well, actually not much has happened since I last wrote.  Basically I haven´t done much sightseeing yet.  Just a lot of walking and pretend shopping.  I saw pretend shopping b/c I the bloody euro is so much more then the dollar.  So I am doing some window shopping.  I went to a couple of "department store" today.  Basically the same thing at home...lots of H&M type stores.  The one big difference is I went to the food court to grab lunch and I had a sandwich and a glass of white wine in the middle of the mall.  That was cool.  What was not cool was when the people next to me finished eating and lit up like a hundred cigarettes.  Well, maybe not a hundred but it sure smelt like it.  Honestly that has been the hardest thing to get over.  I am more sensitive to smoke, now more then ever.    Besides cigarette smoke, I have also had to get used to the constant sound of mopeds whizzing by my apartment.  There are billions of them here and they drive them all night.  I live right off a pretty busy street and there is always cars driving by built the lil mopeds make a heck of a lot of noise.    I guess the big event that happened today was that when I woke up this morning, I wasn´t alone!  On the floor right in front of me was the BIGGEST bug, (I mean insect)I had ever seen.  As you all know I am not really scared of bugs.  Had it been Patty or Nata, they would have fainted at the size of this monstrous insect.  So I grabbed a bag to catch it...and as I approached it it started to fly away.  Ok, so now not only is it a gigantuous bug but the bloody thing can fly too.  So I approached it with caution, I mean I am not to familiar with tremendous, flying insects of Barcelona...needless to say I knocked it down on its back kicked it towards the bathroom and flicked it into the toilet and flushed.  And that was the end of Pablito, my 15 min. insect pet.  Tomorrow I am going to go on one of those tour buses that takes you all around Barcelona.  Its like 3 hours long and supposedly goes just about everywhere.  Now that I have gotten some what familiar with the main streets of Barcelona, I am venturing out a lil more.  My next goal is to have lunch at a restaurant by myself.  We´ll see how that goes.  And yes Liz, I will get right on top of finding a hunky Barci that I can dirty dance with all night long :)  I did work a bit today.  Well, sorta.  I was taking a break from walking b/c my piggies were killing me and I was sitting on this bench, when this lady approached me and asked me if I was going to be there for awhile.  At first I thought it was a trap...some sorta scheme to take away my attention from my purse so her accomplice could make away with my purse.  But we were the only ones there, and see was old.  So I today here, si, (that means yes)and then she asked if I could watch her ice cream stand for her while she went to tinkle.  So I said, si.  And she left, for like forever.  I didn´t think she was ever going to come back.  While I was standing there I wondered why she had asked me.  Maybe b/c I look trust worthy, maybe b/c she could tell I had ice cream experience (I did work at Baskin Robbins for like 3 summers), or maybe it was b/c she really had to go.  Anyhoo, when people approached the ice cream stand I had to tell them, in my best Spanlish...that the lady would be right back.  When she finally returned she, thanked me by giving me a free ice pop...and it was yummy.    Other then that, nothing else is really knew.  Just walking, taking pics (for scrapbooking when I get back) and reading.  Which by the way I have finished the last book I brought. So know I am desperate....does Barnes & Noble deliver to Barcelona??  Anyway's keep the email and comments coming...if there is anything you want me to pick up for you while I´m here just let me know.    Things I have learned while in Barcelona. #1: The banks won´t exchange $100 bills on the account of "they are very likely counterfeit" , so that ended up being this huge fiasco that has totally been resolved so you needn't worry your selves. #2: Barci´s park where ever they feel like..and they are crazy drivers. Plus, I saw my first SUV today.   #3: Speaking of first´s, today I saw the first police officers since I have been here.  There are like non but everything is clean and people obey the laws...What´s up with that! #4: The swaking I here outside my window 24-7 isn´t my neighbors annoying birds.  Barcelona actually has wild parrots.  Saw a few in the park by my house yesterday.  An old man was feeding them and pigeons.  I thought that was weird so I got a pick of them, and then I think the old man thought I was weird and he left...oh well!  I will try to write again the day after tomorrow...Ciao!

      So I am in Spain and hooked up to the internet.  I searched the whole city for an internet place and finally found one today. Yeah!  It is costing me 4.8 euro an hour but well worth it.  Just signed on to AOL IM, and was super charged that I might be able to actually IM with someone, and then I remembered that it´s like 6 am in the States...boohoo.  So here is what has happened on my vacay since I last spoke to you.  I left on Thursday and tried calling everyone I could.  My mom and dad dropped me off and that was an experience in itself.  They were driving me nuts and making me even more nervous then I already was.  Once they left I was left with the dreadful thought of "Oh Shit, I´m going to Spain...ALONE!" So I panicked for and just sat there in the terminal trying to breathe deeply and regain my composure.  Thats when I looked out the terminal window and saw a massive fire.  I immediatley thought, Holy fuck, a plane just crashed!!! The flames were so high and the black smoke was billowing into the air.  I was like thats it, Im not going!  So I walked up to a JFK worker, who was playing a game of Ms Pac-man, and I asked, "Excuse me sir, but could you tell me why there is a huge fire down at that other terminal?"  He glanced up from his game, for about a sec and casually said, "Oh that, yeah they set practice fires sometimes, so that they´re ready for when the really thing happens", and continued to play.  Well, I usually am not that afraid of flying but when you are on line, about to board a huge hunk of metal filled with fuel for a cross atlantic flight and in the distantce you can see what it would actually look like if you plane came crashing down to Earth, Well let me tell you, it was more then a lil unnerving.  Can´t they practice that shit somewhere else? I mean seriously that is the last thing a person wants to think about before they board a plane. So I boarded what i thought would be my last flight and in the back of my mind I kept thinking, if patty were here she would DIE! There would be no way she would ever get on this plane.   So what can I say about the my first Virgin Atlantic fligh to London. It was a JuMbO plane, with stairs and some cheesey neon bar, Yeaaah Baby!...I guess the British like that stuff, Very Austin Powers.  The flight was good, long, but all in all not to bad.  You have your own TV in front of you and shows, movies, music and games on demand.  Watched a flick, listened to some tunes..and challened some other passengers to a lil trivia...of course I dominated the science/technology catergory :) Landed in Heathrow airport,and looked out the window and quess what? you got it..It was raining and cold...and let me say a few words about Heathrow airport ...what a pile of $@#&!  It was by far one of the ugliest, ghettoist airports I have ever been to.  But on the up side...I bought the next shopaholic book ( Shopaholic and sister)...which I bet some of you haven´t even heard of...Anyhoo, I read it and it was Great! So when I get back to the States my fellow booknerds can borrow it.    Got to Barcelona a lil behind schedule and my moms friend was already there.  It was a huge relief when I saw him, and let me just tell you he has been such a lifsaver. So he drove me to my apartment.  And it is just like the pics on the web (in case you want to check am out...go to www.rent4days.com its the miro apartment.  Got that the aparment all squared away and then I was on my own.    So since then I have been some what straving b/c I arrived on friday and everything has been closed till today...well sorta of.  I am getting used to siesta and the fact that people here eat late.  I went out to dinner the other night with my moms friend, Dago, and we ate at 10:30pm, well actually here yo say 22.30.  So I have been trying to adjust to the way of life here.    I haven´t done to much site seeing since I have been just getting settled into my apartment, and have been trying to find a place I can buy food. But when all seemed desperate and lost...on my endless search for something that was open Sunday after 5, I saw it...like a beacon of light, welcoming me....STARBUCKS!!  God bless America and its need to conquerer the world!  I strolled in to Starbucks, ordered a mocha frapp and LOVED IT!   I know I am such a sell out, I´m in a different country, and being so American. I should be drinking sangrias and eating tapas.  But let me just tell you, it is so much easier going into a place where I sorta of know the menu instead of trying to see if the person behind the counter can deceifer my Spanglish.  So here I am Monday, July 12, 2004 in Barcelona doing the same thing i would be doing if I were home, on the internet. And when i go home guess what I´ll making for dinner, if you guessed peas, your a winner!!!   To answer some of your questions: 1) No, I still don´t have a phone no. but I am working on that, hopefully by tomorrow. 2) No, I still don´t know my address.  Well actually I do, but I can´t figure out which is my mail box in the lobby and let all how to open it.  So please hold off on mailing the I Miss You Rose, Tiffany packages :) 3) No, I haven´t met that spanish hunk that is going to sweep me off my feet, or anyone else for that matter... but that due to two reasons:    1) being that it has been bad weather, rain for two days...    2) you have to leave your apartment to meet people and I have been spending most of my time couped up...thinking about venturing out :)  I´ll end with things I have learned since I have been in Barcelona 1) Smoking is allowed everywhere here, and I mean everywhere.  Walking around the airport, resturants, stores...I am in smokers heaven and it´s killing me!!! I have to soak my eyeballs in water when I get back to my apartment. 2)They love to use every hour of the day to the max...and you can find poeple eating dinner as late as 12pm some nights 3) Everything is compact here...including my luxuary IKEA apartment, little elevators, and lil cars.  Patty´s old metero (Puparita) would have felt at home here! 3)Barcelona is gorgeous, just one block away from my apartment is a cute park and some beautiful sites...I will send pics when I figure it out...  I will right more so keep in touch...love ya all and miss you tons!! Rose:)

      Actually, I got Nata and Jessica with me and the role of Wendy is being Played by Mimi. So we have a full house. The apartment is full of clothes, and make up and our shopping bags thrown everywhere.  I don't have much time to type the usually, over detailed accounts of the past days. And actually in the past three days that my quests have been here I have lots more then I did a week on my own here in Barcelona. They leave on tuesday and it seems like time is flying by so fast.  Wednesday I picked them up at the airport and we headed to the apartment. I have to say the girls did wll on packing and we didn't have to strain our backs...just the essentials were packed...as well as all of Mimi´s MAC make-up of course. We had a little siesta and then I took them down to Las Ramblas. It was the usual heticness of the night and they got a good taste of the vibe of the lively street.  Thursday & Friday we have spent sight seeing. We have hit all the major points on the sight seeing tour. I have loads of pictures, I think we are averaging 90 a day. So I will def. have major scrapbooking later. Got to see the amzing Park Guell. Laura told me it was a MUST in Barcelona and she was right! I can´t believe I waited so long to go there. Well actually, I do know why, I remember b/c we had to hike up this steep as hill, and i was like, I am so only doing that hill once in this heat... so I waited till they came:) It was dsigned by Guadi and is a beautiful park filled with spirals and beautiful mosaics....I loved it!  Went to the Miro Museum, house designed by Guadi, got denied and the cathedral for having bare shoulders and have consumed major amounts of water.... so much more and so little time.  having a blast will giove you all details later...love ya...

      Well, I have been preparing for me guests...ie. Jess, Nata, and Mimi. They leave New York tonight and get here tomorrow afternoon. Can't wait. I have been having a great time, but am in definite need of some friends. Perfect timing. I was beginning to get sad...Longing for a place that everybody knows my name, and there always glad I came...heehee. I was beginning to go to Starbucks regularly just to feel a little bit more like home..Pathetic, I know. But I think I had reached my limit of alone time, much longer then I had predicted I would be able to take. I was really scarred after the first night. I was sitting in the apartment thinking, what have I done and what the hell am I going to do with myself for the next 2 months. I really thought that I was just going to lock myself away in the apartment and never leave the safety of it. But I have def. Surprised myself and have done much more then I set out. Don´t get me wrong, there is still a lot I wish I had done but I think it would have been easier if I had someone else to venture out with. But no biggie, made the best of this situ.  So I have a packed agenda for when las chicas land. And they are only here for a week, so we have to be productive and not waste any time...heehee. Tentative itinerary: Wed afternoon: Land in BCN take aerobus to placa Catalunya (cheaper then a cab..and besides I don't think we would all fit in one cab) then train to Placa Espanya and then a short Walk to the apartment. After getting settled, Take metro to Las Ramblas and take a walk around there...maybe grab some dindin there. Thursday and Friday - touring around Barcelona in the fun packed Bus Turistic. Magic Fountain light show at night Saturday: trip to Mont Serrat &amp; the beach...spare time shopping Sunday: trip to Sitges- supposedly has awesome beaches and the town is all made of white stone Monday: Sightseeing the mountains surrounding Barcelona  Very Excited to finally have guest...Probably won´t have as much time as before to update blog but I will def. keep a running journal and let you know how the week goes.  Miss you all!!!  Seacrest oooooout!

      Well, my prayers have been answered... No, Orlando Bloom didn´t just move next door...the temperature here has dropped to almost bearable. We had a much need rainstorm yesterday, which cooled the temperatures considerably. Yesterday I was out all day, despite the occasional showers and today I have been out and about exploring. For awhile there I dreaded leaving the apartment b/c it was sooo hot & humid. But today it is really nice like 29º C, which is nice (I think that would make it around 85ºF).  yesterday, I did some much needed laundry. This time it went quite uneventful, the washer machine fully cooperated and my clothes came out clean &amp; drenched...still can´t get that part right. Put them out to dry in the dry on he drying rack on the terrace. Then I took a nap. When I woke up it was rainy and windy, so I went to check on my clothes... Well I am lucky I did check then b/c my some of my clothes had flown off the drying rack b/c of the wind and were all thrown about the terrace. An thank god for that railing or else my clothes (bras &amp; underwear, included) would have been sprinkled along C/Consel de Cent and I so would not have admitted it was mine. I recovered the stray pieces of clothing and hung them up throughout the apartment for safe keeping, till they dried.  yesterday was also a big day here, in usually quite Barcelona. There was a major protest throughout all of Barci´s major streets. They were lots of people with banners,and masks and shouting stuff. I saw some of them on my way home for walking about and had no idea if it was a parade or something. When I got back home I saw on the news that they had stormed some building, vandalized stores (sray painting and braking windows), attacked cop cars and knocked over dumpster and lit the contents on fire. So I was guessing, it wasn´t a parade. I have no idea what they were protesting because their signs were in Catalan and the news ere is also in Catalan. At first I thought it was about the Iraq war (like in London, there had been some protestors or maybe protesting this thing going on here called forum 2004) But through my excellent powers of deduction and looking at the video footage and pics on the news,  I think  they were protesting the knocking down of condemned housing were people were squatting, but that's just a guess. It could have been the annual looting day, I have no idea.  I am also proud to say that I have expanded my culinary skills to included more then just pasta and peas. yesterday I made a chicken cutlet marinated in some funky sauce I bought at this store, and I made a pasta salad w/ green peppers, tomatoes and Balsamic Vinegrette. It was delish'. But don´t get any crazy ideas, I am not turning into a master chef. I hate cooking b/c I hate all the prep work and I especially hate the clean up afterwards. I have decided that among a maid to clean my house, and ordering my groceries on-line to be delivered to the house, and door to door laundry service... I have to add on at home cook... hmmm... or a husband who will do all that for me...either or! :)  Today I have an average Barci day. I started with coffee in the morning. Then I went down the street and had  churros  with hot chocolate to dip in, yummy. And for luch I had a bocadillo, which consisted of fresh mozzarella and tomatoes, my fav. Today I have been riding the Metro around. I finally got the hang of it and after mastering the Tube in London, this is easy peasy. It is set up just like the Tube, easy to read maps and the card works for both the train and buses. The great thing is that they have a/c on the trains and it is a/c that you can actually feel. It was nice and cool on the train, unlike the Tube that sometimes was so hot I thought I was going to melt. It was so nice that I could just ride the Metro all day, back and forth, just to enjoy the cool refreshing air. Just a thought, for when I gets unbearable again.  Looking into taking some out of Barci trips, but time is running out. I can´t believe that it's already August and in less then a week my visitors (ie. yecca, nata, and mimi) will be here...yipeee! Can't wait.  Did you know? Barci random facts.  1. Down in the Metro stations the have vending machines that sell books. I think that is such a clever idea. You just put your money in select a number and letter and out pops your new book. I though that was neat. Everyone here is carrying their copy of The Da Vinci Code, shame on you for those of you that haven't read it yet.  2. There is a man that every morning goes down the street banging on the orange tanks. I have no idea what they are and why he has to do it every morning but it is annoying and there has to be a better way of advertising then banging on metal tanks every morning.  3. There is graffiti everywhere. Some of it is rather nice, it is amazing what some people can create with a spray can. My spray painting skills stop at lame banners we used to have to make to hang off the carport in Cortland. But some of it is nice, others are just your usual random words and meaningless tags. But I don´t know if it is legal here or what. But people do it in bright daylight. There was this wall they were putting up down the road from me. Well the cement was even dry yet and these kids were spray painting it. I was going to make a citizens arrest but these old people were just sitting on the bench watching them, so I was like, forget it. I guess they just except it here. Which is weird in a city that prides itself in being so clean. hmmm.  Well go to go even though this is the first time that this cheap ass internet place has decided to turn on some air. I was very surprised when I realized I was dripping sweat as I typed... So nice...coool air.  As the say here in Barci...adéu!

      Well, I finally forced myself to come back to the steamy internet cafe. I have been back in Barcelona for two days and it seems like forever. My week in London went so fast and I wish I could have stayed longer. But I am glad to be back in the my apartment and catching up on my old WB shows ( hey Wend, they even have Popular...Remember the pashmina episode?, heehee)  I guess I´ll tell you first how I spent my last 2 days in London. Well, Friday I hopped on the bus and went to Notting Hill section of London. I went shopping on Portabella Road, which is like a street fair. The shops set up outdoor stalls and there is a variety of vendors. I here it is busy and better on the weekends but I thought I would check before I left. This is the closet to the Notting Hill from the movie as you´ll get. Needless to say I didn´t run into Hugh Grant or Julia Roberts...but I still had a great time. You can find everything from antiques, vintage clothing, yummy food, souvenir stuff and the usual knick knacks. I had to check out some of the vintage clothes...it was like a flash back to my childhood. I sifted through everything from member only jackets, converse and tie-dye everything. It was fun. I bought a glass bulb at one of the cute shops to add to my collection...It was only 3 pounds. I bought a sandwich from these cute brothers who were selling homemade sandwiches...They were cheap and yummy. I spent a good 2 hours walking up and down the windy road, took some pics and then headed for the tube.  I hoped on the tube from Notting Hill Gate to Tower Hill. A couple of stops but it felt like forever. The tube is a fast way to cut across town but in the summer it heats up...it was boiling down there I thought I might pass out. I finally made it, jumped off and headed towards Tower Hill and Tower Bridge. Tower Hill has been everything from a palace, a bank, a prison and an a place of execution. There is this part called traitor´s gate, and if you were found of treason that is the last thing you saw. It was built in the late 1200´s, which is cool it is really old and has that England old look to it. But if you look in the distance there is this new building in the horizon. It is shaped like a bullet I guess, with a rounded tapered end. it is completely made of glass and has a beautiful blue and silver color to it. It is a cool looking building but just weird to see a old castle looking thing and a futuristic building. The new building is affectionately called the "gherkin" by the Brits. Next went to Tower Bridge. It is a beautiful bridge...you can go up the Towers and walk across the bridge. It is a beautiful pale blue color and is the bridge you usually see when you see ads and pics of London. I had some Japanese guy take my pic by the bridge and I took his pic. I have to say... there are a lot of Japanese tourist here- they seem to like to arcitecture aspect of London...and you can pick them out from a mile away, just look for the mass of flashing bulbs from their cameras.   I had to head home early because my aunt was taking me out to dinner and out dancing. My aunt made me drink a little whiskey before we left. She loves her whiskey, I tried it, I thought I was going to die! I so can´t drink like I used to. I think I had that whiskey, 3 beers and was pretty much buzzing the whole night. Anyhoo, so around 10pm we headed out. Grabbed a quick bite and went down to the river. The place she took me was a Colombia club, I guess. It was on a boat, not too small but not big either. Upstairs they had tables you could drink at and downstairs they had the dance floor. As you walked down you could hear the music blasting and feel the heat..it was hot as hell down there. We sat at a table order drinks. I was with my aunt, her boyfriend, her friend and her daughter´s husband´s sister. I sat there enjoying my beer chattin with the ladies. And then the dancin started. I have to say this type of environment is not my fav. First of all, the ladies basically sit around and wait for someone to ask them to dance. I was like Oh God, please don´t have anyone ask me. I cannot dance to Spanish music for shit. Well, I avoided being asked for awhile. Then they played some music that I was comfortable dancing too, some of the same stuff they play when we go out... so I got up and danced a bit. Well, after that I went to sit down and this guy came over to ask me to dance...I was like Um, no gracias...but apparently that wasn´t in his vocab b/c next thing I know I am being led to the dance floor....my very embarrassing attempt of trying to dance was fortunately not caught on camera. So I did my best to try to avoid being asked as much as possible, the basic strategic moves like, stare at drink intently, turn to speak to someone at table as soon as prospective askeree approached...and I have to say did fairly well, only had to dance a couple of times. But I did get to talk to some British ´blokes´. Actually towards the end there were more and more Londerner there then Spanish people. This guy was tall and cute and we just chatted at the bar about random stuff. All in all I had a good time. We left the bar at 3:30 am and hoped in a cab home. We got home and stayed up taking...My aunts boyfriend was drunk and telling us funny stories...we finally got to bed around 4:3am and we had to get up early the next morning.  So I woke up got dressed and packed by 10am Saturday. We headed off to grab lunch around Notting Hill. My aunt had to run an errand and then we were off to Greenwich via the city boat cruise. It traveled down he Thames River. A member of the crew gave a very interesting guided tour of the sights along the Thames. He had a cockney accent, straight from a Guy Richie film and he was a hottie. It was defiantly a highlights of the trip. He was super funny, which paid off for him b/c at the end people tipped him.   Greenwich is a beautiful part of London, away from the city part. We went to this great park and climbed this steep hill and took pictures from this bluff. It was very nice. There was also this cute little fair there. We walked trough it and bought lunch. I had juice, fruit (peach) and pallea. They were also selling crafts and homemade goods. I was so tempted to buy dried lavender, it was cheap and smelt so good but I had nowhere to put it my luggage was packed to the max. :(  After that we had to hop back on the boat and sorta rush to the train. I got to the train in the nick of time. I just caught the 7pm express train from Victoria Station to Gatwick airport. I barely had time to say goodbye and thanks to my aunt. I will have to send her something when I get back to the states. She was great and I had a great time visiting her in London. And to think she has lived there for over 25 years. I told her that I was def. coming to visit next summer and she was so excited. she started rattling off all the places we could go to from London. Yeah!  Got to the airport, flight was quick...met the sweetest guy on the plane. He is one of those talkers... but he was so nice...and we talked about the must sees in Barcelona. He helped ring my luggage to catch a taxi. That was nice. My cab driver was also a talker, telling me about the lat American he drove, was from New York...yadah,yaddah, yaddah, and he was asking me about the States and how it compared to Barcelona. Seriously, the people here are Super nice, very talkative and friendly.   Comparing Barcelona and London. Barcelona is by far a more beautiful city. The streets are nice, and clean, the building are gorgeous and it has that old and new type of feel. London has that wonderful pride of being such a historical place that also makes it such a great place. Both cities have great transportation and so many sights to see. The food in Barcelona is excellent but you can find all you want in London. Both cities appreciate a good beer/wine and relaxing with friends. London shuts down early while Barcelona starts kicking again after 10pm. Both have their good points and I have had a great time visiting both.   Things I´ll remember from my trip to London.  1. Mind the Gap...kept ringing through my head the whole time there. They say it at every stop on the tube and ater a while you hear it even when your not on the tube.   2. I had my first taste of fish and chips on Friday, a favorite of Londoners And even though I really don´t like fish, I tried it as the say " when in Rome..." and it wasn´t so bad. I guess anything fried just taste like fried stuff.   3. I finally got the hang of crossing the street in London with out having to read the road telling you which way to look. Next time I go, I´ll be a crossing expert.  4. The double decker buses, black cabs, phone boxes and mailboxes. Definitely icons of London and give it that special feeling that you are in a different city unlike New York.   5. The accents..Sometimes cute, at other times annoying. But you got to love it when it is coming out of the like of hugh grant and Colin Firth for example.  6. The great parks in London. Hyde Park in the middle of London was a great little refuge and they have so many parks...it is a nice change from all the streets and buildings.  Had a brilliant time in London...Can´t wait to go back...this time with friends to enjoy it with! :)  Up to the same old here In Barci, but really it is too hot to even go exploring. I thought I would be used to the heat by now, but today I thought I was going to pass out. I guess some people are made for hot weather And me, I´m not! And if I have to suffer these temps. I want a/c and lots of it. Basically, I am counting down the days till my sisters and Mimi get here. I have a packed Itinerary and hope there up for it. It will be nice to have someone to shoe around and someone to talk to. And in English!! Even in London I spoke a lot of Spanish to my aunt.   Well, I am still sweating, if you can imagine, everyone here is, and I basically am going to call it quits. Wendy had a good idea that I should type my blogs in the apartment and bring them here. I am going to try that next time.   I am still trying to get my pics to upload to the computer but having a little bit of trouble.  I will write soon. Hope you´ll all having a great summer. You are all in my thoughts and I miss ya´ll.  besos.
