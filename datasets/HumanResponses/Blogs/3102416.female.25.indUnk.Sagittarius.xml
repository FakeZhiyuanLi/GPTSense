       I was able, for the first time in my life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say it at the exact moment I wanted to say it. And of course, afterwards, I felt terrible.    Tonight I was driving down the road with the windows down (even though it was REALLY humid) looking at this massive sunset which enveloped a parting thunderstorm. On one side was clear blue sky; on the other a tall thunderstorm shooting straight up into the sky, the kind they call an "anvil" cloud if you're a weather dork like me.  Even though I had groceries in the back seat that needed to get home, I found myself driving around just to stare at it. And I wanted to call a friend of mine to tell him about it, only I can't.   A few months ago I said some things to him that I later realized later were WAY out of line and hurtful. I used his trust of me in disclosing some of his own insecurities to hide some of my own. I THINK it's the first time I've ever done that, but I sure did it...  I've asked his forgiveness, but it doesn't change the fact that this friendship with a really amazing man is over. He was the type of friend that made you feel alive every time you talked, and in whom you saw such light and depth, despite the sometimes rough edges. I'm struck tonight with overwhelming sadness, remorse, regret and shame that this friendship ended so quickly, by my own doing. And the thing is: I don't know if what I said even hurt this guy. It would have hurt me if someone had said those things to me, but he may have dismissed them altogether (which hopefully he did).  My sin...it consumes me.

       urlLink PROV 25:13-15; : "14 Like clouds and wind without rain  is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give. "  I was upstairs reading  urlLink Posers, Fakers and Wannabes  when I realized it's thundering again. Yesterday afternoon, it seemed as though the skies were going to open up and dump all all the rain for an entire month, all at once. And it looked that way for hours! Dark, swirling clouds; bright, straight streaks of lightning, loud, thunderous claps of...well, thunder. And you could feel the breeze shifting from the north, pushing out the sauna-like humidity that is normal for Houston during summer. People were coming out of their homes to stand in the street and look, just ready for that deluge....this went on for about two hours before finally, it did rain.  When the power went out from a lightning strike, I thought about this verse. I first learned it to say, "A man who boasts of gifts he doesn't have is like wind and clouds with no rain." We stood outside yesterday, waiting for that fierce refreshing that comes during and after a rain. For the greening-up of the trees and grasses; for the cleaner, sweeter air; and for the rain itself to wash away the dirt and chemicals that build up on our cars from the chemical plants here. We were so anxious that those clouds and wind would produce what they promised.  Another verse:  urlLink MATT 7; :7'Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 8For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. 9'Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 11If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!"  I am thankful that God IS NOT a man who promises gifts he does not have, but is more than willing to give us those things that we ask for. Clearly, God intends to give us "gifts." However, the context of this particular verse is interesting, because both the verses before and after talk about recognizing our own sin, and repenting of it. Another thing happens here when it rains: everything floods! It causes mass chaos every single time it rains because it never does it just a little. It always seems to be a tropical storm (I guess it would seem that to me, being from Ohio).  I feel as though God is saying, "Yes, I do promise gifts and am able to give them, but too often you seek a gift that is not related to my continuing forgiveness. Like the rain, I want to come and refresh you and cleanse you, but you must remember that the same refreshing rain also destroys, and there are still parts of you which need destroyed: roots of sin and selfishness which cause the rains to merely roll off of the soil in your heart, rather than soaking in. Prepare your heart, spirit and mind just as a farmer would till and feed his earth, so that when the refreshing rains come, you will be able to receive them."

      I got in a car accident today. An X-terra backed into my 8-month old Honda Accord at the airport and cut a hole in my front grill.  My friend Brad and I were talking last fall about his new Lexus (it's pretty).   Okay. side note. It was nice out that evening, too, while we sat at this little Mexican restaurant in Rock Hill trying to figure out who the other person had become. We hadn't seen each other in over five years at that point. We grew up in Ohio together, and come to find out many years later, he lived but an hour from me in SC. Back to the show.  Brad had just traded in his new Jeep to get this shiny black Lexus, with the sports package, no less. Where we grew up, NO ONE owns a Lexus. Let's put it this way: his Lexus cost 50% more than the avg. salary in the area we lived.   We were talking about what a good feeling it is to be able to finally purchase something that you never thought you could own, that you earned, and that YOU had the money to buy. Now, I understand that there is a world of difference between his Lexus and my Accy, and that the whole conversatin was very materialistic in the first place...but now this thing which is mine (and seemed so perfect because of that) is busted. It just makes me sad. Like can't the big X-terra go pick on someone who doesn't appreciate having a nice car? Can't THEY get their bumper cut up?

      My friend and pastor Jerry was responding to an email I wrote him (his response below). I'm always amazed how at God speaks to me through him...and how every word he chooses seems to have such intent and purpose behind it.  "The beloved...I believe it is the single most important awareness you and I will ever have. Your words at the end of your message summarize the impact of living in the sweet spot of His love. "The bottom line, nothing else matters. Or at least things don't matter quite as much." Getting a job or not getting a job holds no sway over the fundamental truth of our lives, our belovedness.  Jay sees something in you, as do I, that is attractive and encouraging. I think it is the glory of your identity in Christ. I love the passage that says "we are being transformed with ever-increasing glory" (1 Cor...I think). When this happens, as this happens, our unveiled faces begin to resemble our Father's face of loving compassion. Even as I type these words my heart accelerates with excitement and something that is very close to disbelief. How can it be that God would love me this much? That He would allow me to bear His image? That He would deem me worthy of such unfathomable love? It is prepostorous! Scandalous (one of Manning's words). But fantastic!  I feel my calling emerging from the experiences of my life. I want to invest myself in helping others realize what I am only beginning to understand, the relentless love and compassionate tenderness of Christ. I am convinced that if more of US -- those within the church who are alive in Christ but not FULLY ALIVE -- began to understand the insurpassable love of Christ, more people, people like Jay and so many seekers (Christian seekers and pre-Christian seekers) would notice and inquire. The Beloved of God are the most attractive people we will ever meet."

      I've often wondered if there is a thin line between those things you should say, and those things you shouldn't. Does honesty reign supreme? JM would probably say I need to wonder about that a little more, because I hadn't found that balance the last time we talked, and I doubt that I've found it even now.

      I think that  urlLink Waterdeep  is quite possibly the best band ever. Here are the lyrics to one of their most popular songs, but I don't think it's my favorite...  Everyone's Beautiful I used to draw all the time back when I was in high school; Thick yellow pencils with soft lead that smeared real easy page after page. I was lonely. But senior year I met a girl and she made me feel better here but a girl was a girl was a girl   CHORUS  And she was beautiful; Everyone's beautiful; I smeared the picture and left it with her to appraise   I remember in junior high, half sick from fear on the hillside; Eddie wore braces and talked like he couldn't be beaten; Shawn had said Friday out back after school and Eddie was stumbling, blood mixed with drool; But a fight is a fight is a fight   CHORUS  Still they were beautiful;Everyone's beautiful; All of us crawling on hands and knees in need of you   BRIDGE  I want to lift my memory of them in the desert and set it on fire and watch it burn, watch it burn; Oh, how it changes and hope that the smoke of the sins of my youth will sail to the base of the throne of a King cause a prayer is a prayer is a prayer   CHORUS  And they were beautiful; Everyone's beautiful; Let them all find their redemption down deep in Your eyes

      I've recently caught up with a friend from a few years back. We met when I was 17, and he must have been...21 (edited for jimi, who doesn't like to feel old, so you think he'd be okay with the fact that I wrote 18 at first), though he seemed much older at the time. He had driven to where we were cross country in his Honda hatchback, and stopped to see the Grand Canyon along the way. I thought that was really cool because most of my friends back home had never been to the Grand Canyon, let alone driven there by themselves.  He's kind of hard to talk to, but funny, I'll admit. He's not very much like me, I don't think, but every once in a while we agree on something and are surprised. He would say that we don't think very much alike in the WAY that we think, but I'm not so sure about that. More often, I suppose we just disagree. I get the feeling that mostly he's smarter than I am, a lot smarter, because sometimes he has to explain things like what ^= means, and who MCEscher is, and why I should know who that is. And typically, I wouldn't like a friend like that, but with him, it's okay, because I don't get the feeling that I'm stupid because I don't know those things. He's kind of just "friend" rather than "friend" with a definition around him. We should all have more friends like that.

      My friend  urlLink Devan  called the other day and asked if I could help her figure out her next step in life. I don't know why people think I can help with that. I can't figure out mine, let alone hers. Joe once said that if I'd ever write about the things I think and how I see things, he'd buy it. I guess those who can't, teach.  But her question is a whole other beast. She's recently married and also finished grad school the week of her wedding, then moved to her husband's town rather than the other way around. It's about 50 miles north of where she lived previously.  Her question was whether or not she should quit her job and take the summer off, which seemed like a simple enough question. But in reality what she was saying was, "I feel like I've lost everything that was me, and if I quit my job, then all I'll be is Scott's wife who helps out with the youth group and goes to the gym." That's tough stuff...losing oneself, and I think it's part of the trade of being married, though I don't really know. I told her I couldn't help with that feeling, cause I can't, and it's not like that's going to go away since they intend forever to really be forever. But I did say that it was stupid to drive 50 miles one way every day for work because she's going to tear up her car doing that. She tried to say that she's built all of these great relationships with not-yet-followers at her work in her old town, and that she doesn't want to give those up. And I told her that it's not like she's going to be spending a lot of quality time with them anyway, if she knows she has to drive home 50 miles after work.  Seems like one of those things you should talk about BEFORE you get married; not to stop the wedding, but just to be prepared for that feeling.

      I was watching the MTV2 special, " urlLink Linkin Park Makes a Video " tonight. Their latest video is a Japanese anime style video, and they used Japanese artists obviously to create the majority of the video, and then just brought it back the States for final editing.  They were talking about some of the challenges of trying to produce a video with artists who don't speak English, and they said something that I think is VERY representative of our life today (or, I should say, of the cultures of the "developed countries"). He said, "Yes, we had a language barrier because they spoke Japanese and we spoke English. But, the good thing is, we didn't have a CULTURAL barrier, because the Japanese love Linkin Park and Linkin Park loves this idea." That was so interesting...a language barrier, not a cultural one. That's all...I just thought that was cool.

      Back to something the youth pastor spoke about yesterday morning. He talked about how we use the wrong instruments to know God. (an illustration he admitted is not his own).  He said we use a microscope. Like we plate God up, and put him under the light, then get in as close as we can to try to figure out what he is and who he is...and we try to dissect every little part of Him, as if he is able to be completely dissected. And you know how when you're looking down the eye piece of a microscope, Barney the Purple Dino could be standing behind you doing a square dance with SpongeBob and you wouldn't know it because you get that strange tunnel vision. He said we do that, and we miss out on the beauty of the lab...and of just marveling at God himself.   Instead, he said we should be using hearing aids, because God is always speaking. I like that. A lot...because I know I need to turn my up.  But back to the microscope. When he was talking about cranking down the focus knobs and trying to dissect every little part of Christ, I got this strange visual image. Imagine you're cranking it down and you know how at first, it's blurry, because you have to figure out what you're looking for and the best focus to be able to see it? Well, that's how it is. And you can't see a clear image of what's on the glass, but as you try harder, it starts becoming clearer. And so you move to the fine tune knob, and it REALLY starts to become clear. And then you realize it's text, and you zoom out just enough to read it.   It says, "Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here. He is risen."  Isn't that the truth? He's not on the glass. He can't be. But God IS ALWAYS AND STILL speaking, and if we have our eyes and ears tuned only into the figuring out of what's happening now, then how will we catch him alive, walking around the lab behind us?

      From a church in Central Ohio... "Dear Angie, I very much enjoyed our phone conversation last week.  I have been sifting through a lot of applications and have been on the phone for hours of interviews.  I came away from our conversation thinking there may very well be something here.  It seemed like we were talking a lot of the same language.  Now after several days of thinking and praying about it, I still think that is true.  Are you interested in flying up here, at our expense, for a weekend interview sometime in the next few weeks?  Probably a Friday through Sunday will work best.  That would also give you a chance to have a look at the church.  If you'd like to do that, please let me know which weekends in June or July will work for you. Again, a real pleasure talking with you."

      Tonight was New Life service (once a month, extended praise and worship, believer's focused). It was AMAZING, and just again confirmed this feeling that maybe this church is where I'm supposed to be. It's the same feeling I got the very first day I visited there...like God had given me an Oasis in my desert. I hate Texas, but I love this church, and feel more of a peace about staying here than about going anywhere else. I think I know what that means, but I'm not sure...

      The  urlLink youth pastor  at the church I attend spoke this morning about the "brand promise" of our church: Come to Life. He's an interesting guy (in a good way). I thought the message was great and even told him so, but I'm sure he'll get home and second guess whether he should have said this or that (like the sandlot reference to the PF Flyers, which I, of course, got right away), or taken a drink of his "abnormally large" water, or the obsure "in a nutshell" throwback to Austin Powers?" which probably made him quickly wonder if he should reference AP from the platform...without really pausing to know that this morning,  God spoke through him, and that God had some good things to say.  When I was first introduced to his ministry (it was admittedly an off-night), I wasn't sure I'd WANT to be involved because everything was so chaotic. But as I've gotten to know him, I wonder if I could even display half of the compassion and depth that he does sometimes. And I pray that he'd be encouraged and know that he's making a difference still...cause youth pastors don't feel that enough (particularly when they're told that their ministry is one of sowing, and so they're made to feel badly if they WANT to know that they're making a difference by a show of some small fruit).  I love this church, and find myself wishing that I wasn't considering and looking for ways to be in ministry elsewhere (though I think I might go nuts soon if I'm not FT again). This church is the type of place that makes you want to commit, that makes you want to get off the sidelines. Now, I'm a "pastor" so I don't really know what it's like to BE on the sidelines, but what I'm saying is that this place makes me not care if I'm never a pastor again, as long as I could partner with THEM in ministry. My job right now doesn't really allow me to settle down here with this church even if I wanted to, so it's this strange feeling of wanting to really commit, but knowing that it's probably not a good idea, too.

       Baseball players are smarter than football players. How often do you see a baseball team penalised for too many players on the field?    I love baseball. And I do believe that baseball loves me. One of the only advantages of being here in Armpit, TX is that the All Star Game is being held here. A few months ago I got the bright idea to volunteer for All Star Week, not expecting to get tickets to the game, just wanting to be a part of the EVENT. I was excited then when the Astros accepted me as one of their volunteers; a Houston City Ambassador no less...getting distinguised guests from the airports and escorting them to their hotels, making sure they felt warmly welcomed by a native Houston (well, there was nothing on the forms about how long I'd actually LIVED in Houston...)  Unfortunately, I couldn't attend the mandatory training sessions, so volunteering was out. This afternoon I got a letter in the mail from the Astros letting me know that the city had an overwhelming response to the need for volunteers and that they were not going to be able to use me after all (which was okay, since I hadn't attended that training, a fact which seemed to have slipped by them). But for the love of the game, they gave me two tickets to a game next week.  urlLink Here are my seats.  I'm going to take Stephen, the middle boy of the family I live with because his b-day is next week. We'll be in territory to catch a homerun ball, though I'm not sure Stephen could, bless his heart. Anyway, it should be fun. I love baseball.

       urlLink  "JESUS+HEALED" REFERENCES    My mom has been recovering from a couple bouts with breast cancer since 1997. One lumpectomy, lymphectomy, mastectomy, one round each of radiation and chemo later...we think she's clean. Last year, though, some doc said she also has  urlLink MS . We don't know yet if it's true (it's hard to get a solid diagnosis on that while it's in its early stages). She has all the symptoms though, which is terrible. In 2000, we saw some notes on one of her MRI's that hinted that she either had early stages of MS or Alzheimer's, but when we asked the docs about it, they sort of ignored it. Good stuff, huh? Well anyway,  urlLink MD Anderson  (the best cancer hospital in the world just happens to be here in Houston, and through some gov't. program, my mom gets to go there with no insurance) they called last week and wanted my mom to come in for more tests. We're not sure if these are random check up tests, or if they found something last time we were there in March and are just now investigating it further. They have a Starbucks in the lobby, BTW, right next to the guy who plays the Grand Piano, which is right by valet parking...So for three days this week, we drive an hour into H-town so she can have tests on her brain and kidney (?? why the kidney ??). We see her doctor on Friday afternoon to find out results.  But everytime I'm there, I wish I had the superpower of healing. Well, I wish all the time that I had it, but more so when I'm there. There are so many sick people there (and at the Medical Center area of Houston in general - it's basically an entire corner of Houston that is just one hospital after another). I think about how Jesus would go somewhere and be moved with compassion, and just start healing. I'm moved with compassion for sick people all the time, and I wonder why I can't just stretch out my hand and heal them?  Why not?  Jesus did it, and it seemed really normal for the apostles, too. And he said we'd do even greater things than healing? I had a friend in college who had  urlLink MD . He walked with crutches and couldn't lift his head and everything. Then, between my freshman and sophomore year, he was healed. Completely healed. Isn't that wild? Straight legs, no crutches, the whole deal. We used to watch videos in Signs and Wonders class where Oral Roberts would heal people, and you'd see stuff like peoples legs grow right on the video. Of course, part of me thought it was a sham, but then again, I knew this guy when he walked on crutches, and I knew him with straight legs, and that's just as miraculous as a leg growing on video.  My mom said this afternoon that she met a lady in the changing room who had cancer around her heart, and in the ventricles of her heart (that's rare). Out of the blue, this lady asked my mom if mom thought she should have the surgery they were suggesting to remove it from her heart. Of course, my mom told her yes, saying something about how it must be God's plan for her to have come this far, and to this place, and that God would take care of her from here. I just don't know what to think about that. God's PLAN that we get sick? Why do people believe that? Jesus healed; he made things new; he restored. Why can't we just say, "It's a result of sin and satan, and we fight it with every breath and prayer we can in the name of Jesus?" I hate it. I hate sickness and disease.

       urlLink  James 1: True Religion    27Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.   Religion comes from the Latin religare, and means reconnection.   ("Re-" means "to do again"; "-lig" is the root found in words like "ligament" and "ligature," and refers to a connective.) So religion maybe means a connective do-over? I kind of like that definition. But what in the world does it have to do with widows and orphans? Do you think that James meant this literally - that the truest, most acceptable way to express our religion is to care for the orphans and widows? or was it more like, "just look after others and remember that you're not the only one taking up space on this dirt." You know, I've read of people who give up pursuing a properous career to go live and serve in the inner city or rural areas. They don't do anything that gains them national spotlight, or gets written about...they just look after orphans and widows and people who need help. And they do things like make gardens to share the veggies, and tutor, and paint fences and stuff like that, and have little Bible studies...things that matter. And it sure seems that in doing those things, they're keeping themselves from being polluted by the world, even as their swimming in its pollution. This is a very attractive thing to me - as sometimes I feel this longing to move back home to Northridge just to do that sort of thing.  Isn't it funny that they don't teach that in Christian colleges? Like where's the degree for "just barely making it because you're intentionally living at the same level as those in your neighborhood and what you really need to know is how to fix your neighbor's plumbing and other little things like that?" I guess Missionary degrees are the closest you'd come to getting that info - but too bad there aren't (m)any missionary degrees aimed at sticking around here in the US.

       Let's Go Krogering!   Only we were at Randall's in Clear Lake, the one with a StarBuck's inside. (There are exactly 8 StarBuck's within 15 minutes of my house, BTW, not that I even like coffee).  Earlier this week I had my J-high small group at Randall's cause our hosts' were out of town. These are 7th/8th grade girls, and this was only the second time we've met. Mostly, I don't know these girls since I'm fairly new to the church, but as most 7/8 grade girls go, I like them.  So I asked them to go through the store and find two items that described their relationship with God. Junior High kids are just getting to the point where they can think abstractly, so this is a good spiritual and mental excercise for them. At first, they seemed like they might have trouble finding some things, but after about six minutes, they were coming back asking if they could get three and four things, rather than just two. Here are some of the things they brought back and why:   A zipper pull  with a name stenciled on it BECAUSE our relationship with God is unique to each one of us, and he speaks to each of us differently. It is personalized just the zipper pull.  Each girl brought back a pack of  chewing gum  BECAUSE our relationship with God is long lasting, just like the gum.  A pair of  cheap flip-flops  BECAUSE sometimes our relationship flip-flops back and forth between loving God intensely, and then...not so much.  A pack of  Brawny paper towels  BECAUSE God is strong and is there to clean up our sin, just like the paper towels clean up a mess.  A bottle of  SPF 50 sunblock  BECAUSE God is the strongest protection one can have, and like sunblock, you can't just commit to him once and have everything just perfect - he needs to "constantly be put on."  A package of  Spaghetti  BECAUSE when we are not right in our relationship with God, our hearts become hard and stiff and easily broken, and also not used for their true purpose. But when we take steps to be right and to know God (which is sometimes painful like being in boiling water) our hearts become soft and maleable again, and able to fulfill their true purpose.  I told the girls that each of these items is like a parable, and that Jesus chose to teach in parables often. He'd be walking down the road with his crew and see a farmer working in the field and just break out into, "You know, the kingdom of God is like that farmer..." and that God was wanting to speak to us in the same today. They were sort of surprised to hear that Jesus might be walking through Randall's saying, "you know...the kingdom of God is like a pack of spaghetti..." I hope they'll take some time to look around for those parables...  I hope I'LL take some time to look around for those parables...

       Easy Tiger!   I think I need to slow down when I read the Bible. I read it so quickly and forget sometimes to let every word soak in. Like this, the intro to Ephesians: 1I, Paul, am under God's plan as an apostle, a special agent of Christ Jesus, writing to you faithful Christians in Ephesus. 2I greet you with the grace and peace poured into our lives by God our Father and our Master, Jesus Christ.  Those are pretty unique words, "under God's plan," as a "special agent," and "with the grace and peace poured into our lives." Normally, I'd read right over those, but today I sighed a little, praying that God would pour some grace and peace into my life, perhaps through the encouragement of a fellow believer just as Paul was doing.

       "Why do we all have to go on a diet?"  "Because in cheerleading, we throw people in the air, and fat people don't go as high."   I cooked last night. Enough to eat well for at least a week. Joe said to me once in that tone that only someone who has been there could understand, "It's hard isn't it?" (about losing weight). And I just sort of sighed and said, "Yeah, Joe, it is." And I think the reason that it is because no one cares about it except for yourself. Of course, in a general way, we all want each other to be healthy. But when it comes down to it - I'm the one who has to get up and eat five times a day rather than just once or twice...I'm the one who has to fill up the water bottle and I'm the one who has to work out more. I hate to sound so cheesy, but "if it's meant to be, it's up to me."  And on a completely unrelated note - I hate junebugs.

       That's a wrap.   I have a headache. I think it's from that stupid soda I had with dinner (it was caffeine free, diet coke...but still...I hadn't had a drink in a few days, just water). Dinner, btw, was terrible! I accidentally bought low-carb tortilla wraps (and it truly WAS an accident), but that's what I had and I used them to make a chicken wrap. Yeah...so basically, tortillas are NOTHING BUT carbs, so they must have made these from tissue paper. They were about as thin and probably taste just the same. Yuck. Mental note: check the package before buying tortillas next time. I'm going to bed.  and...just two days 'til my weekend interview.

      I was reading  urlLink Ephesians  tonight, in both the NLT and Message.   Check out the difference in how 1v23 is translated:  (the message)  The church, you see, is not peripheral to the world; the world is peripheral to the church. The church is Christ's body, in which he speaks and acts, by which he fills everything with his presence   (NLT)  And the church is his body; it is filled by Christ, who fills everything everywhere with his presence.  Not to say that either is right or wrong, but it's interesting that Peterson added in such strong words as "the world is peripheral to the church." I'm not sure what I think about that statement. I think I either REALLY agree with it, or I really DISAGREE with it, though I'm not sure which one, if even!. There's nothing in the NLT verses that even hint of this question. Maybe I just dislike the word peripheral. When I think of "peripheral" I think of things one hardly notices unless one makes an effort to notice them. I wonder what the technical  urlLink definition  is...maybe it can help.  1. Related to, located in, or constituting an outer boundary or periphery.  2. Perceived or perceiving near the outer edges of the retina: peripheral vision. Anatomy. Of the surface or outer part of a body or organ; external.  3. Of, relating to, or being part of the peripheral nervous system.  4.  Of minor relevance or importance.   5. Auxiliary.   And there it is. That's why I don't like the word peripheral, or the idea that either is peripheral to the other - definition #4: of minor relevance or importance. If it had read that the church was peripheral to the world, I wouldn't like it. If it had read that the world was peripheral to the church, I still wouldn't like it because I back it into a corner with this definition. I think I need to not read the Message version of this verse...

       John 20:23: If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.   I talked with  urlLink this friend  tonight for the first time since I was wrong, and from what he says, it's all good.  The verse above is really interesting. It would seem that God doesn't intend for men to be able to truly forgive our sins (judging from the rest of the Bible). But here, is this verse that sort of says the opposite. As I think about this broken relationship, I wonder if it's because I didn't feel the freedom of that forgiveness until I knew that it was there. I certainly had repented of it, but I wonder if there is something to being free of the shame and guilt of our sin by knowing that the other person has released us from it. Who knows...

       I do remember, only Pooh doesn't very well, so that's why he likes having it told to him again. Because then it's a real story and not just remembering.	- Christopher Robin   There are stories in the Bible which I can retell by heart, and have taught on many times. Tonight, a pastor on tv was teaching about one of that passages, the Promised Land, and about this particular verse:   (Deuteronomy 11) 8 Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, 9 and so that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your forefathers to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. 10 The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden. 11 But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven. 12 It is a land the LORD your God cares for; the eyes of the LORD your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end.    Sometimes, particularly with OT passages, I think teachers take too much liberty on the meaning of the text beyond the actual, historical meaning. But at the same time, sometimes, I feel God speaking through those overestimations. This pastor was saying that God was speaking a word of encouragement to some people: that the land they had just come out of was not going to be like the land God was bringing them into. That in their "Egypt," they worked and strived to make things happen (v10), but that in their new land, God would care for things and for them, as he briings them into those things he has promised them.  Like I said, that's a pretty big jump, and nowhere in the text that it could necessarily be applied to today. But, God's word is living and active and still speaking and creating!? and I don't get to argue with that. I heard something in those words tonight that was, in fact, encouraging. And the story is so simple. I remember days when these simple deductions from scripture were the life of me. As I watched this pastor tonight (teaching in an environment very similar to ORU), I remembered one of the few things I liked about ORU: the expectancy and simple faith. We expected that the Bible was going to speak to us; that God himself was waiting with baited breath to speak something new and amazing and lovely to us (and He did so regularly); that we were called to this amazing adventure and that this was only the beginning. It was, in those respects, an amazing experience. It was such a simple faith, and I wonder sometimes if God isn't calling me back to that.

        Suddenly I realized - two people isn't enough. You need backup. If you're only two people, and someone drops off the edge, then you're on your own. Two isn't a large enough number. You need three at least (Marcus, About A Boy)     WARNING: ANNOYINGLY LONG POST.  So I just finished watching what has to be the best movie I've seen all year, save maybe the Last Samurai, which I actually saw last year...so I guess About A Boy takes it. If you haven't seen this movie, here's a couple of quips to whet your tastes...    By "Will" who is a single, 38 year old    The thing is, a person's life is like a TV show. I was the star of The Will Show. And The Will Show wasn't an ensemble drama. Guests came and went, but I was the regular. It came down to me and me alone. If Marcus' mum couldn't manage her own show, if her ratings were falling, it was sad, but that was her problem.     Once you open your door to one person [emotionally] anyone can come in.     Fiona: I mean, he's a special - very, very special boy and he's got a special soul, and I've wounded it.  Will: Oh, please, just shut up. You're wounding my soul.     Christine: Oh, no... it's just I thought you had hidden depths.  Will: No, no, you've always had that wrong about me. I really am this shallow.     Will: I find the key is to think of a day as units of time, each unit consisting of no more than thirty minutes. Full hours can be a little bit intimidating and most activities take about half an hour. Taking a bath: one unit, watching countdown: one unit, web-based research: two units, exercising: three units, having my hair carefully disheveled: four units. It's amazing how the day fills up, and I often wonder, to be absolutely honest, if I'd ever have time for a job; how do people cram them in?     Will: Me, I didn't mean anything. About anything, to anyone. And I knew that guaranteed me a long, depression-free life.     Will: [voiceover] She couldn't stay at my place, and she didn't have a DVD, or satellite, or cable, so we were always stuck watching some crap made for t.v. movie about a kid with leukemia. I had to end it.     By Marcus, a 12 year old boy (about a girl he likes)    Marcus: I wanna be with her more, I wanna be with her all the time, and I wanna tell her things I don't even tell you or mum. And I don't want her to have another boyfriend. I suppose if I could have all those things, I wouldn't really mind if I touched her or not.     (about the complications of a suicide note)    Marcus: I got the letter. Thanks.  Fiona: Oh my God. I'd forgotten.  Marcus: You forgot? You forgot a suicide letter?  Fiona: Well I didn't think I'd have to remember it, did I? Did you read the part where I said I'd always love you?  Marcus: It's a bit hard for you to love me when you're dead, isn't it?

       Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more (Proverbs 31v6-7)    Can you believe that's in the Bible? God! How does he think of this stuff! Anyway, a good friend called me the other night at about 3:30AM to talk, after having had "a few adult beverages" as he said. The thing about this friend, is that he's not one of those drinkers who can't hold his drink. When he's been drinking, he seems to have the same clarity of mind that he usually does, only happier, and sadder at the same time.  So he said that some things while we were talking that I'm not quite sure what to do with. And I have all these choices:      1. Ignore that he said something at all, thinking that IF he remembers it, and IF he wants to talk about it, he will bring it up.     2. Be intentional about bringing it up so that he knows he didn't get away with just "letting it slip out" while he was drunk. Of course, this would assume that he meant what he said.   The funny thing about this friend, too, is that I'm just about the only believer he knows. So it's interesting that when he's drunk at 3:30AM and needs someone to talk to, I come to mind. One day, I pray that he'll realize it's not ME he's drawn to, but the God in me.

       Grove City Vineyard: Captain's Log, Day Four   Last night they offered me the position of Director of Student Ministries and Assimilation. Too bad that doesn't make some sort of cool acronym. I accepted it, with the idea that I'd also take two days to just it stew and confirm the decision, but it's right. Seven months ago I left a perfectly good ministry to go to "nothing," and after talking with lots of "not quite rights," it's good to have the "right" dropped in my lap, when I not suspecting it. So much so that I'd even told my friend jimi that I was quite sure going into the interview that I was not going to get the job (which he was quick to remind me of when I told him I had).  I have interviewed with many other churches, and done some extensive face-to-face interviewing, as well. And at each one of those places, I look back at the interview and know that I wasn't myself during my visit. I was nervous and "trying" to be the right person for the job. In both cases, I think I could have DONE the job without being the right person. Here, I felt the freedom to just be who I am. Parts of that, I suppose, are outstanding, but other parts aren't. Jeff Kinney told me once that when I found the place where I could just be myself, that's when I'd know I was where I needed to be. I think he was right. So anyway - I'll be heading up to Grove City, OH in mid-August, via SC to visit some friends there, too. Good stuff happening...

       Everybody Duck!    Scott and I have been going through CD's today, sorting out which ones are his and which one are mine. We came across my CD EverybodyDuck. I had forgotten about this band. I really like them - but they have a strange sound. Below is one of their songs called 8.The part in italics at the beginning is sung by a little kid, then the band breaks into for the rest of the song. This might be one of those songs that you have to hear to get, but just imagine a party at Frankie's Fun House or Magic Castle as you read it...   Today's the 8th anniversary of the day I was born  I've been alive exactly eight years today  My name is Joey and I can't see a more valid excuse  To have a wild, raging party than my birthday  So I invited all my friends to come and started making plans  For the greatest party 3rd grade's ever seen  All my closest friends and I would go to Skippy's Pizza-rama  They've got skeeball and these dancing chimpanzees  Every person in attendance would have candy all his own  And more pizza than an army could consume  I paid everyone's admission and I thought my heart would burst  With excitement as we walked into the room  But as I turned to see the joy on all the faces of my friends  I was shocked to see an empty space where they had all just been   I'm so alone  And it's my birthday  All by myself  What is the deal?  I'm the only person sitting at a table set for twelve  And I just can't help but think that this could be...how God must feel...how God must feel   My best friend Andy's sharing pizza that I bought with some dumb girl  And Steven Dobbs is playing air hockey with Jake  Kevin's paying Junior Highers with my tokens for his life  And I think Jeff is selling slices of my cake  Everywhere I look I see those who should be looking at me  It's my birthday after all but they don't care  I put so much into making this a party they would like  I guess I just thought they'd have gratitude to spare  But as I turned to see the joy on all the faces of my friends  I was shocked to see an empty space where they had all just been   I'm so alone  And I'm their Savior  All by myself  What is the deal?  I'm the only one that saved them from the sins that held them down and I just can't help but think that they don't care…how I might feel…

       I don't know where I am... I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody but I, I can't remember... and I can't remember...    I was talking with my friend jimi tonight. As I mentioned before, we interned together in CO. He has memories of stuff we supposedly did in CO that I just don't remember at all. Like he said we went kicking around the town of Telluride and then hiking for a little while. Funny thing though - I don't remember that at all! And he says we all watched MIB and My Best Friend's Wedding at the drive in. I don't remember that, either! It is the strangest thing - he says he has distinct memories of me being&nbsp;at some events&nbsp;and I have absolutely no memory of them at all! He says he has pictures, so we'll see who's right when I stroll into Columbus...

       Do you mean you knew what was happening to us all the time? Well, of course. I am the Supreme Being. I'm not entirely dim.     Many Disciples Desert Jesus (John 6:60-69)  Even his disciples said, "This is very hard to understand. How can anyone accept it?" Jesus knew within himself that his disciples were complaining, so he said to them, "Does this offend you? Then what will you think if you see me, the Son of Man, return to heaven again? It is the Spirit who gives eternal life. Human effort accomplishes nothing. And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But some of you don't believe me." (For Jesus knew from the beginning who didn't believe, and he knew who would betray him.) Then he said, "That is what I meant when I said that people can't come to me unless the Father brings them to me." At this point many of his disciples turned away and deserted him. Then Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, "Are you going to leave, too?" Simon Peter replied,  "Lord, to whom would we go? You alone have the words that give eternal life. We believe them, and we know you are the Holy One of God."     I do not "envy the wicked." Honestly, I don't. I'm not wanting to be one of the disciples above who simply walked away. But there are seasons when the Lord says something hard to me, and I want to say, "God - that's tough stuff! What am I supposed to do with that? What do you want from me!?" It's like he asks so much of me, and so little at the same time. He asks for  MY  everything, but asks me to do nothing in order to receive  HIS  everything, which is in fact, what enables me to give him everything in the first place. And at the same time, like Peter, the end of the conversation is this sort of hope-filled exasperation of saying, "God - even if what you say is tough - where else am I going to go? Who else is there but you? You ALONE have the words of life, the words and love and forgiveness we thirst for. You are who you say you are, and we'll follow you even when it's hard because of that." We're in to the end because he's real.  I pray that I (and we) would find a revelation from God this week that would cause us to say, "Oh God! To whom would we go if not to you? You along have the words that give eternal life and we know you are the Holy One of God."

       Some sort of sick double dog dare...    We went swimming tonight again. Last night, the oldest boy, Michael couldn't go because he was at swim lessons. But when we got home and recounted to him the belly-flop contest, he was certain that he would never give in to such pressure, especially if it meant doing something that would hurt him. Well, needless to say, it wasn't more than four minutes after "encouraging" him to do a purposeful belly flop TONIGHT that he did one SOOOOO grand, I let him out of the standard three flops and just settled for the one great one. He said it hurt a little more than he expected because he hit face first. VERY funny stuff...   And! Can you believe it! "But now our appetite is gone. There is nothing at all to look at except this manna." (Num. 11:4-6) We had SPAGHETTI again tonight! ARGH! God MUST be trying to teach me something...hahaha...   And! I THOUGHT I'd found an amazing apartment in Grove City - it was a full 200&nbsp;sq. ft. bigger than the others for about $50 less/month (even better than I'd thought - cause I thought it was only 75 sq. ft. bigger). But Karen (the senior pastor's wife) went driving tonight to look at them, and thought I might like some other apartments I am considering better than the "amazing" apartment. The "other" apartments come with a free gym membership...gotta love that...but for an hour or so tonight I was looking forward to the extra space in the "amazing" apartment. Oh well...gotta go with what looks safest and cleanest.  AND! two last things.&nbsp;jimi is really saying some good stuff on his blog this week. You gotta love people who actually love Christ and can see the distractions from him in their lives (even if they don't always know what to do about it). It's this ongoing, ever-changing relationship with the living Christ and his living Word that changes us.   And, I missed a chat with the crew from Youth Specialities tonight because I didn't account for the time change. How disappointing. Maybe if I get chosen as a volunteer for the Atlanta conference&nbsp;I'll get to meet all those crazy, like-minded youth ministry friends...

       When it rains, it pours.   I think I went a few days last week without writing anything, so I feel a need to make up for it this week. Here's just some stupid stuff for you. I don't like spaghetti. I keep thinking my taste is going to change somehow and I will suddenly like it, but I don't. From the fact that it's difficult to eat to the fact that I just don't like the taste! I don't think I'll ever have spaghetti again if I can help it.  Also, we went swimming today after work. I took just a few of the kids down to the pool - they'd already been swimming once today at swim lessons. I'm not a very good swimmer, but it's fun nonetheless to go play with them. My fun comes in getting them to do silly things like belly-flop contests (their parents would have thought that was funny, btw). You know it's good when the all-too-cool lifeguards come over to watch and laugh. But we did get to actually swim quite a bit - since the kids are learning the basics of the different swim strokes, of course we had to take an hour or so of our time to actually swim rather than just play. After almost two hours of swimming and carting the kids around the pool, my legs are just a little sore. That's a good feeling. I told the kids we could go swimming every day this week if they're good.

       He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose (jim elliot)   That's probably Jim Elliot's most famous quote. I'm reading his journal right now (big read at almost 500 pages). Here are just a few quotes that have stood out to me over the past few days:  1. Boldness in  doing  God's will combined with with contemplation of the Word to  know  God's will is the forumula for "good success" whitersoever thou goest. 2. There can be no lasting testimony without a corresponding act of obedience (often a painful one) on the part of the individual. 3. [writing about how he had "dedicated" his feelings for the future Mrs. Elliot to God and "let her go"] But the subtle danger was in retaining hopes that He would give her back to me eventually, that our decision to go seperately for God would be ultimately revoked by Him and on such fare I survived. But this was just as if I never really "devoted" her at all, for there was still a future claim on her. 4. Lord, teach me this: in situations where I think myself competent, let me find then my whole sufficiency in Thee. 5. [about a story in Judges where God did not drive out all of the other nations from an area Israel was possessing in order "to prove Israel" to see if they would walk in his ways.] There dwell yet so many of the "original inhabitants" of my old flesh that I have not been able to drive them out. The Lord wants to see if I will follow Him regardless of civil conflict. 6. The kings came from things commonplace. Skill, fine features, pleasing manners - "personality" - can be had by external imposition, and God cares little for such. His eye is on the heart Now external effects are not bad - David had them: cunning, courageous, clever and comely. But what was important was that "the Lord was with him."

       More about the concerts last night...and a long post ahead   So like I said, last night we went to see David Crowder, Mercy Me and MW Smith. I'm really only going to mention Mercy Me, because I didn't care much for the other two (interestingly enough, since I like David Crowder).  Everytime I see Mercy Me in concert, I'm reminded why they're some of my favorite worshippers. First of all, but not most importantly, they understand how to use visual media to bring people into a focused place of worship. They're one of the only bands I know of that makes such an effort to use media and to have it SPEAK as much as their songs.   Secondly, and most importantly, their lyrics are so simple and straightforward and honest, and when they bring it, they bring their own worship to Christ, rather than a performance for the people. They stand there, with hardly any "show" and just worship! allowing you to join them. They don't get in the way of your feelings for Christ or impose their relationship and moment with Christ on you, rather they allow you to experience your own moment. They don't bring attention to themselves in any way, really. The band writes all of their own songs, and perhaps that contributes to the personal nature of their worship. But let's talk about the words, from the song Undone:   No apologies For who I'm meant to be The only thing that matters is I am free When I am overwhelmed Holding pieces of my heart When I feel my world Start to fall apart  To the cross I run Holding high my chains undone Now I am finally free Free to be what I've become Undone  Even in defeat The face of tragedy Still you'd have to say that I found victory In brokenness comes beauty Divine fragility Reminding me of nail scarred hands Reaching out for me    Last night when I got home, I talked briefly with  urlLink jimi  about how sometimes God makes us feel so helpless and confused about our lives, and how it's in that state that we recognize our neediness; our "dependancy" as jimi put it. I'm not sure I've ever really understood the idea of being dependant on another person, so perhaps it's a hard transfer for me spiritually. jimi said he prefers that state because we SHOULD prefer dependancy. Ugh. Of course, he's right, but on the surface, I prefer just knowing how God is shaping me. I'm not even talking about knowing "God's will" in the situations of life, though that's part of it. I want to know how he's creating a new heart in me; how he's working out some of the old man in me (yeah, the one that's in actuality, dead); that my sins are forgiven still and again. But it's like I said to jimi, that knowing is such a subtle thing, and the changes themselves are subtle. Sometimes, I should prefer that he just drop me a note and say, "Today Angie, we'll be dealing with x, y, and z, and at the end of the day, you'll have experienced my love in these ways..." I was reading some Jim Elliot today, and reminded in his writings about our propensity to return to feeling like we're capable of...well, anything! and how much we need to confess that sin and believe that it is only through FAITH in Christ that we are saved.   Nothing else. Faith alone. I can't. Reminds me of another song, Just Like You but Jason Upton. This is probably the song that has impacted me most for it so best describes where I end up too often. Here are the lyrics and then that's all for right now because this is getting annoyingly long...   I tried to walk on the water and found myself under the sea  So with water up my nose I felt your hand come close to save me  I’ve tried to cast out the demons I’ve gone to the darkest of regions  When fear has me shaking you suddenly break in to save me   I desire To be like you  Like any son or daughter  I want to be like my Father  I desire to be like you  You promised to never forsake me  So I’ll risk it all if you’ll make me like You   You stand beside me just waiting while I try to go it alone  Smiling You say son come here won’t you let me just help you  But frustrated I try to make it cause I’ve just got something to prove  Not knowing it is my weakness that perfects your power

       One more thing before bed tonight...   I was thinking about some new people who have come into my life over the past few weeks, and it's just so interesting...One never knows who is going to pop into your life and how they're going to get there. I forget sometimes how deeply we are changed by the presence of PEOPLE in our lives, or how QUICKLY they can make us think and feel and love.   [begin sidetrack] Tom Pauquette (for future reference referred to simply as "Tom" and he is the Senior Pastor at the Grove City Vineyard...) Tom was reviewing the church's mission statement when I was up there visiting. It is "to be a church for people who didn't think they'd like church..." emphasizing that Sunday the words, "for people." He jokingly said we're not a church for pets, or a church because the Vineyard needed a franchise on the southwest side of town. We're a church for PEOPLE, and that's why we exist. I really think that I'm learning to love PEOPLE more; I PRAY that I would love PEOPLE more cause they're all that really matters. [end sidetrack]  It really IS like a new storyline begun every time we meet someone new, cause you never know what is going to come of that friendship. Fun stuff, and we're changed by that "stuff" everyday.

       No original thoughts, just music.    Some lyrics I like from an India Arie song:  If you give me half a chance  I'll prove this to you  I will be patient, kind, faithful and true  To a man who loves music  A man who loves art  Respect's the spirit world  And thinks with his heart    I don't particularly love these words in reference to a man I could marry, though certainly that's true - but I also just the idea of&nbsp;msyelf BEING a person who is patient, kind, faithful, true,&nbsp; loves music and art,&nbsp; respects the Spirit and thinks with my own heart.

       I wonder what sort of tale have we have fallen into (Sam Wise the Brave)   I'm reading "Waking the Dead" by John Eldredge. There is this unexpected chapter about myths, and how important they are to our spirits. I'm not sure what else to say about it right now, but there are some thoughts from the book I'd like to share. They are below:   "Years ago a mother wrote to CS Lewis ragarding her son (age nine) and his love for the Chronicles of Narnia. The boy was feeling bad because he felt he loved Aslan (the lion hero of the story) more than Jesus. With grace and brilliance Lewis replied that he need not worry: "For the things he loves Aslan for doing or saying are simply the things that Jesus really did and said. So that when Laurence thinks he is loving Aslan, he is really loving Jesus: and perhaps loving Him omre than he ever did before." Truth doesn't need a verse attached to it to be true. All that you loved about Aslan IS Jesus."   A thought about that: I should hope that the things people love about me are actually things they love about Jesus.   "What do all the great stories and myths tell us? What do they have in common? What are they trying to get across? Where they may come from, whatever their shape might be, they nearly always speak to us, they nearly always speak to us Three Eternal Truths."   Those Three Eternal Truths are: 1. Things are not what they seem (Genesis 28:12-16, Luke 24:30-32) 2. Some great struggle or battle is well under way (Ephesians 5:14-16; Daniel 10) 3. We have a crucial role to play  I'm sure I'll have some more to say about this book (uh..well...I mean some thoughts of my OWN rather than just quotes from the book) as the days progess...I've had this book since February and have put off completing it because, honestly, it was a big weighty for me. It speaks a little TOO much to where I am and I fear that it will be one of those books that really challenges, convicts and changes me. ugh!

       I know a lot of people without brains who do an awful lot of talking (Scarecrow, Wizard of Oz)   There is something completely repulsing about talking about politics. I used to love the process (and I suppose I still do somewhere deep down) but there are so many stupid people talking, and stupid people talking as if they know anything about anything...ugh, just makes me want to tune out of anything political. I wish that we could just listen to the politicians talk, and everyone else could just be quiet. Isn't that terrible of me to say? But it's really how I feel?  And yes, this post does continue my continual distraction. I'm going to bed. Maybe I can focus on something (anything!) in my dreams.

       The rest of the world is sweeping past us. The oil and gas of the Texas future is the well-educated mind. But we are still worried about whether Midland can beat Odessa at football (Mark White, Governor of Texas)   Well one things for sure...I won't be worrying about whether Midland beats Odessa anytime soon. Michael and I went up to the park tonight to pass the football, and I remembered that I really never learned how! I'm getting better and get some good straight spiral off every third pass or so, but really...I just want to pick it up and hurl it like a softball or baseball, and that's not really the point of football, is it? Anyway, had FUN! but I'll not be joining any women's football leagues anytime soon.

       Pinky Swears   I think I'd like to write something (a lesson, message, article, book, etc..) called Pinky Swears that explains the different convenants of God in terms that youth can understand. If you pick up the book of Matthew and just START to read the genelogies, you'll realize how packed with richness each of the names there are...but beyond that every once in a while on of the major covenant players will jump out at you. Each one of those covenants is a thread in the story we're in, and it's really important to know them and understand them. For example, how many teens take communion every once in a while, and even hear this verse:   Luke 22 19Taking bread, he blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, given for you. Eat it in my memory." 20He did the same with the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the  new covenant  written in my blood, blood poured out for you.  but never really understand what that covenant part is about? Anyway, I was in church yesterday morning and the Pinky Swears thing popped into my mind. Could be fun stuff...

       If I were drinking milk right now, it would all over the desk.   Okay, this is one of those things that's probably only funny to me, but I want to remember it just as it happened (because jimi says I have no long OR short term memory) and this is worth remembering. He and I were talking about how we're so different, and think differently and hardly ever "get" each other when this happened...note the bolds because they were typed at the same time.  angelaincarolina: and that water is included along with electric and gas if I sign a 13 month lease? vt imij: actually angelaincarolina: did I tell you that already? vt imij: i don't even know you  angelaincarolina: who are you? vt imij: who are you?  angelaincarolina: i hate when that happens. angelaincarolina: cause with you and I... angelaincarolina: it shouldn't. angelaincarolina: makes me want to go take a shower and wash whatever that is off. angelaincarolina: with a natural sea sponge. the kind which aren't really soft. vt imij: (can't hear you from the sound of soap in mouth) angelaincarolina: hahahaha...

       He Knows My Name   This morning I went to  urlLink Clear Creek  (different than my  urlLink usual church ). I've been feeling a need to go there for a week or so now, but I'm really glad I did today. I have been thinking about this song, "He Knows My Name" for the past week, and really have felt God speaking to me through it.  urlLink Chord charts here  So imagine my surprise this morning when they sang it as a special. Also, the Small Groups pastor spoke this morning, and spoke of the blood of Jesus in a way I hadn't heard before. It's a really simple illustration, though. He talked about how our sin stains us and tarnishes the fact that we are made in the image of God. God created us, but our sins covers up that fact. Then he talked about the blood of Jesus being the cleansing agent that cleans off the tarnish and and allows the image of God to shine through, allowing his own image to act as beacon for the God that is relentlessly pursuing us always. I just liked that thought: the image of God in us calling out to the God that is always seeking us. Good stuff. The lyrics to the song are down below.  He Knows My Name Vs 1 I have a Maker He formed my heart. Before even time began, My life was in His hand.  Chorus He knows my name; He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls And hears me when I call.  Vs 2 I have a Father; He calls me His own. He’ll never leave me, No matter where I go.

       Feeling Hot, Hot, Hot!   Dang. It is only 11:30AM and it's already 91 degrees here in Armpit, TX. And that's without humidity! Count that and the "feels like" temp is 106! Whew! Did I mention that's it's only 81 in Grove City right now? And the "feels like" temp is juts 82?! Yeah, that's going to feel nice... We've gone swimming almost every day this week, but really, the water is not even that cold at this point. OH yeah - word to the wise - one really shouldn't open one's eyes too much in a pool. I don't think that chlorine is a substance that's good for our eyes. At least not mine. I spent half the day yesterday walking around like Saul because I couldn't see when we got home.
