       Black out! time is abt 10.15pm... while i was surfing the net... suddenly total darkness.... so scarely...i m alone at home... quickly i made a call to d... his house was not affected...  so i went to look for my little tourch light... a very mini one that is always by my bedside... just in case.... then went to look for some candles... that mama kept in the storeroom... yes of all the places...inside the storeroom... using my barehands to search for those candles... finally managed to find them or else....  i lighted 1 candle, placed it inside a mug... easy for me to bring around... i walked to kitchen...looked out of the window... wow...terrible traffic jam... streets with no lights...so dark... Mama walked up the stairs with some moonlight... helping her....almost breathless she said...  my room was hot & stuffy...i worried that my fish will die... luckily the power was restored at abt 12am.... time to go to bed... got to work... kind of fun...the last experience was more than 10yrs ago...   mood: white  (='.'=)
