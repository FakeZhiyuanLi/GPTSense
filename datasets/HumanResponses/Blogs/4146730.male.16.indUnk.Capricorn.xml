      Leave (Get Out) Lyrics  Ummmm, oohhh, ohhh, yeah  I've been waitin all day for ya babe So won't you come and sit and talk to me And tell me about how we're gonna be together always  Hope you know that when it's late at night I hold on to my pillow tight And think about how you promised me forever  (I never thought that anyone) Could make me feel this way, ohh (Now that you're here, boy all I want) Is just a chance to say  CHORUS: Get out (leave) right now It's the end of you and me It's too late (now) and I can't wait For you to be gone Cause I know about her (who) and I wonder (why) How I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time(waste of time)  Tell me why you're lookin so confused When I'm the one who didn't know the truth How could you ever be so cold  To go behind my back and call my friend Boy you musthave gone and bumped your head Because you left her number on your phone  (So now after all I've said and done) Maybe I'm the one to blame but (To think that you could be the one) Well it didn't work out that way  CHORUS: Get out (leave) right now It's the end of you and me It's too late (now) and I can't wait For you to be gone Cause I know about her (who) and I wonder (why) How I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time(waste of time)  I wanted you right here with me But I have no choice, you gotta leave Because my heart is breakin With every word I'm sayin I gave up everything I had On something that just wouldn't last But I refuse to cry No tears will fall from these eyes  GET OUT!!!!  CHORUS: Get out (leave) right now It's the end of you and me It's too late (now) and I can't wait For you to be gone Cause I know about her (who) and I wonder (why) How I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time(waste of time)  CHORUS: Get out (leave) right now It's the end of you and me It's too late (now) and I can't wait For you to be gone Cause I know about her (who) and I wonder (why) How I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time(waste of time)  Get out (leave) You and me It's too late (now) You Bout her (who, why) You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time
