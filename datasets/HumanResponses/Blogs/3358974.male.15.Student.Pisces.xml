      Ok, now that Im back from Belgium due to the much anticipated History Field Trip, I will provide you with the highlights from the trip:  Day 1 - Tuesday  A slow yet exciting day, filled with travelling and the settling in process. As me and my room-mate (Sharpie) entered our room, we couldn't stop laughing at the shittyness of it. A leak in the bottom corner and joined up beds didn't impress us.  Dinner was exciting, spawning a ficticious romance between Sarah and the french waiter called 'Roman' which she didn't seem to enjoy. Chicken and Chips to eat was not bad, however they took their time delivering the salt which mildly pissed me off!  Day 2 - Wednesday  A long ass day! Filled with Museum Visits and the Birthdays of Tuman, Arnie and John. We went to a Restaurant and had dinner there. Guess what we ate...Chicken and Chips!  The night picked up as the Birthday boys were serenaded by a group of middle-aged pedophiles playing instruments. The lads received ice-creams containing what could only be described as a flare, in them, for glitzy effect. The ice-creams probably cost more than all our dinners put together, but hey...Im not complaining.  Day 3 - Thursday  The last day of History, as we visited more gravesites, and finally a long tour with a woman called 'Avril'. This woman kept emphasizing that the Soldiers wore loads of clothes, and didn't really focus on the events of the war.  We went to her cafe to unload our Euros which was convenient as I had no drinks left in my bag. Coming back to the hotel we had to do a quiz, based on General Knowledge, History and Sport...which our team won thanks to some genius by Scott.  A short 30 minutes free time which consisted of us breaking the lift, stealing cups from everyones rooms and generally pissing teachers off was quite fun.  Before we went to sleep, a verbal attack on the local french youth was inevitable, and their drunken-ness led them to thump on our windows until they passed out. As per usual I took a shower with perfect timing to avoid being told of by Mr. Baker  The Final Day - Friday  A free day really, with us being dropped off in Bruges, to achknowledge and admire the smell of cow manure and horse shit. Everyone went chocolate crazy and spent literally hundreds of euros on the brown shit.  The ferry was interesting, with John spending his life savings on Time Crisis, and then finding out he sucks at it.  ---  Overall this trip was disappointing, as you can see from my account of it. I was expecting much more free time and fun activities.
