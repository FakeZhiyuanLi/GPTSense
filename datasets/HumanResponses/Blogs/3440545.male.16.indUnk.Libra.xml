      I have just tried searching for PEEWITS on google search engine. It came up with numerous results  Clive is leading us to believe that  PEEWITS  stands for    Plymouth East Explorers With Intention Of Travelling Somwhere.   But I foud out that a PEEWIT is,  a small dark bird with a white chest and raised feathers on its head   I know there are may more defintions for PEEWITS, so I now set the challenge for people to find other meanings and post them on the blog.

      Maybe It would be nice to get  CHEAP SKI EQUIPMENT  as we are going to Switzerland. This won't make much sense to anyone, the google ads at the top respond to keywords in posts and titles.   Please Give me you e-mail address if you wish to join.              Olly

      If i sound angry, i am giving a prior warning, I AM ANNOYED!  People we need more organization. 5 weeks ago i mentioned the tour, 5 BLOODY WEEKS!!!!  and now what, nobody can afford it. You All could when i suggested it, so whats different now?   I gave people a predicted cost of £50 - £80, which the actual cost falls into.   OK, i can understand if you are going somewhere else, ...

      Last Night was  The Best  concert i have ever been to, including TRAVIS.   Jamie Cullum was absolutly amazing, the 2 supports were also very good (Lucie Silvas and Tom Baxter). Jaime took every song form his Twenty Something album and made each of them completly original. Covers of "Frontin" and "High and Dry" were inspirational. Then, taking the whole audience and getting us to sing a 3 part harmony (which sounded amazing)... pure magic. His 2 encores were top quality. He is undoubtably the greatest artist in the last 4 years to perform in the Pavailions! and i think thousands of other people would agree with me.  He Almost destroyed his piano constantly beating it with his hands, chairs, stands, feet and pretty much anything he could get his hands on. Yet it still stayed perfectly in tune. His "good luck carpet" kept the audience entertained - Though really it wasn't needed.  Acapello, harmonies, solos, inspirational playing, amazing drumming on the piano the concert had it all.   I am amazed at how little this account has come to, but words can not describe the brilliance of it. There just aren't enough of concerts of this standard coming to Plymouth.
