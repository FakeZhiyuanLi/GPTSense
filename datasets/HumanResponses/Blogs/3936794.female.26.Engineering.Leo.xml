      This is one guy that I cannot stand. I think his sole purpose for living is to be a thorn in the collective backside of anything and anyone Conservative. He is blindly anti-Bush, anti-Conservative, anti-Truth,... you name it.

      Another  great posting  from Ambra Nykol...  This girl (Ambra) amazes me! She's very eloquent and extremely intelligent. I can't stop reading her blog. :) Below are some portions of the  previously noted post  that stood out to me:        Ghandi stated a very powerful truth when he said (paraphrased),  "The biggest enemy of Christianity is not other religions. The real enemy is those who say they are Christian but live a life contrary to that reality."  As much as I disagree with some of Ghandi's philosophy, I have to co-sign on that statement, and then hold up a mirror immediately thereafter. It often amazes me that America calls itself a Christian nation. Foundationally, perhaps. Historically, perhaps. On paper, perhaps. By and large, America has got some serious explaining to do about keeping that title in all honesty.       Boy, she's not kidding! I've also heard this on one of my Christian music CDs... "Jesus Freak" by dcTalk. They state,  "The single greatest cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, then walk out the door and deny Him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."  *moment of silence* That is POWERFUL stuff folks! Don't jeopardize the eternity of other human beings by setting an example that will turn them OFF from the love of Jesus Christ and His gift of salvation!        The face of Christianity is under intense scrutiny. The current battle is not really for the world and those that don't know God (although it should be). The battle is for revelation of the truth of the total reality of the Gospel. No half-steppin'. Are you in or are you out? There is something quite unsettling about anything lukewarm. Have you ever pulled your twice-warmed leftovers out of the microwave, taken a bite, only to find out that while the outside is hot, the center is well, warm and tastes pretty disgusting? I can't even imagine how God feels. So many of us straddle a foggy line. On one side of that line is evil, the other side is righteousness, the middle is morality. Somehow, morality gets confused with righteousness and that's where the mix-up begins.       This is definitely a real problem with Christians today. There are MANY "Christians" who only proclaim to be Christians because they've somehow associated themselves with that "group of people." For example, people can grow up attending Christian schools, proclaim to BE Christians, and NOT actually be Christian. The reason? They have entirely missed the point of Christianity altogether! No one can *make* someone become a Christian... and you cannot be a Christian simply by association. You have to make a  personal life choice  to accept Christ into your heart and to believe that Jesus really did walk this earth as a human being... and that He really did die, conquer death three days later, and save us from our sins. Actually  becoming  a Christian is quite simple... or so it seems. But things will change for you once you do whole-heartedly accept Christ as your Savior. You know what I think is the best part? Ever since I became a real Christian... and understood what it meant to follow Christ... I have come to recognize clearly which things in life matter and which things don't. The lines aren't so blurry anymore. Because Christ is my conscience now. And when I get stressed out about things, I ask myself, "Will this matter? How significant is this from the persective of eternity?" Most of the time, that right there wipes my stress away. I know God is taking care of me. There's no way I would be where I am right now without His guidance. I'm not (at ALL) saying that I'm perfect or "better" than anyone else... but I have someone who leads me who IS perfect. Unfortunately, I don't always listen to Him... and I mess up sometimes... but I stand firm in my belief that God is doing great things in my life. He is amazing.

      I thought  this blog entry , written by  Ambra Nykol , was very well-written. I couldn't agree more with this...       All legal battles aside, I find the saddest reality at work here is the perceived sense of freedom being preached alongside of same-sex marriages. I watched on television as newly"wed" "couples" celebrated, hugged, rejoiced with their family members and adopted children, held up celebratory signs, and shared with the media the "liberty and freedom" they felt.  If only people knew how far from free they really were. It is my opinion that the lowest form of human existence is to live our lives the way God never intended. To see people celebrating the relativistic un-truth of freedom in a relationship God never intended us to have is absolutely heartbreaking. This is true separation from God. This is the big lie.  A lie not only told via the homosexual agenda, but through the humanist agenda, the feminist agenda, and many others. The lie perpetuated is this "false freedom" people believe they have when they can do whatever they want to do, say what they want to say, live how they want to live, doing whatever comes naturally, completely unencumbered by any laws (but in fact, set free by those laws), and certainly not hindered by any religion, let alone a God whose only goal is to make our lives miserable on the Earth right? It is this thought exactly that is holding many captive in bondage as we speak.       I think Ambra hit the nail right on the head. The problem with our society today is that people want to live like they have no responsibilities whatsoever. They want to do whatever they want and have no restrictions... no rules to live by. But God gave us rules and commandments for a reason. Living a sinful lifestyle does nothing but bring you further from God and deeper into denial. I'm not saying that everyone who is "gay" is a sinner and everyone who is "straight" is squeaky clean. That is FAR from the truth. Sin is sin. But to be fully redeemed in Christ, you have to let go of the sins that control your life and follow Him. That is the ONLY way to find peace in your life and in your heart. This one life is the ONLY chance we have to give our lives over to God and to receive Salvation. Please do not waste it. Before you know it, your time on earth will be over. Are you ready to stand before God? Will He recognize you when you do? Now is the time to choose between an eternity of peace and an eternity of pain. Which will you choose?     What does the Bible say about homosexuality ?

      Now, you may read some of my posts and think I'm not very "Christian-like" sometimes because I get angry about things. However, I want to state, for the record, that I am not perfect... nor do I ever claim to be. That is why I am glad that I have  urlLink redemption in Christ . There are things in this world that I view as completely unacceptable... and it's pretty clear what those things are according to my blog. I am normally a very even-tempered person... but I am very angered when it comes to things that go against everything I believe in. I am a FIRM BELIEVER that every child conceived ought to have a right to life. I don't believe there is EVER a case where abortion is considered "okay." I also believe that there are things in this world worth fighting for... and that for every freedom we have in this great country of ours... we have had to FIGHT for it. That is why I support this war in Iraq... to free those oppressed people from a regime that was crippling them (not to mention KILLING them) and to fight against global terror. I don't believe the 9/11 terrorists attacks against the U.S. could have been avoided... by either the Clinton administration OR the Bush administration(s). I believe that even with the intelligence and information our top agencies had, the terrorists were still one step ahead of us. I also believe that our great President Bush is doing an excellent job in helping to fight this war against terror. His plan isn't perfect... but no human beings' plan could ever BE perfect. Only God's Plan is perfect... and too many of us forget that. I believe that no matter what a person has done, believed, or supported in their life... even if it's the "worst of all sinful things"... God offers  urlLink redemption for you ! That is what He is all about... TRUTH AND GRACE. He understands our innermost thoughts... and He WANTS to accept every single human being into His Kingdom, but we can only be welcomed into His Kingdom if we accept Him and believe in things He would have us believe in. In an earlier entry of mine, I mentioned a book called " urlLink Changes That Heal ," by Dr. Henry Cloud. It is an excellent book that talks about how many people have been "burned" by Christianity, because they've either experienced, or known people, who have lived either a life of "Grace without Truth" or "Truth without Grace." I TRULY believe that to truly understand God and His offer of salvation, we need to have a life of BOTH Truth and Grace. This may not make sense to you now, but the book explains it very well. I highly recommend it if you are at all curious about Christians and/or Christianity.

      Heck, I'm glad not all human beings  period  are this stupid... stupid enough to buy into this garbage. Check out some of this stuff that  urlLink Planned Parenthood  is trying to get "empowered women" everywhere to buy into. First of all, there is this  T-shirt ...       A new fashion statement?     "Gee! How cute! I wonder if it comes in pink or baby blue?" ... Now tell me, who in their right mind (or even "left mind") would be proud to wear something like this? It's just like wearing a T-shirt that says, "I am a murderer and proud of it!" or "I kill(ed) my child(ren) and I'm proud of it, because I'm an empowered woman!" ... all of which sounds completely asinine. It's almost as if this was a joke! Again... all of this is just a portion of the plain and simple reasons why I'm a proud Conservative Republican who believes in the sanctity of HUMAN LIFE... not the "empowered choice" to kill my kids just because I should be able to choose what happens to my body. This kind of thing angers me like NO OTHER. There is NO EXCUSE FOR ABORTION!!! None. (Actually, come to think of it, maybe every woman who has ever had an abortion  should  wear this shirt... so they can wear this "scarlet letter" and perhaps, for the first time, feel the shame they SHOULD feel for killing their child... or children.)  This book , also listed on the Planned Parenthood website, is completely ludicrous as well. Read the reviews for this book listed below it. Are these people complete fools or what? Good grief! If these guys did anything that wasn't 100% selfish, I would die of shock...             "Reproductive freedom is as crucial to life and health as freedom of speech, but the Bush administration is eliminating it. If you think that's an exaggeration — or if you already know it isn't but don't know what to do about it — read Gloria Feldt's THE WAR ON CHOICE." —  Gloria Steinem  "I've been committed to reproductive freedom for most of my adult life, and am thrilled to see the cause represented so eloquently, passionately, and even movingly in Gloria Feldt's book. This book is for anyone who cares about a woman's right to control her own body, and wants to know what each of us can do to protect that right." —  Julianne Moore , actor "A vital manual for every woman who cares about her sisters, daughters, or friends." —  Kathleen Turner , actor "Gloria Feldt's book will shake every woman to the core. She makes a compelling case. We either exercise our power as citizens, or else we risk losing control of our lives for generations to come." —  Donna Dees-Thomas , founder, Million Mom March "A wake-up call that needs to be read! An eye-opening description of the insiduous, persistent and successful right-wing extremists' war on women, packed with an arsenal of practical tools we must all use to fight the war against choice." —  Michael Moore        (Yeah right, and Michael Moore claims he's not a Democrat! Interesting that he is so against "war" but this is one war that he is willing to plug... the fight   against   the basic right of humanity... for unborn babies to have the right to live! ... hmmm...) Thank goodness I'm an American woman with a brain who can think for myself! Not every American is as blind as these fools are...

      I came across another awesome blog today. Check out this info from " urlLink The Patriette "...        1. I haven't seen Fahrenheit 911. Anyone know where I can get a bootleg copy of it? I actually want to see it just so I can adequately bash it (hey, if he's gonna make the movie with a bias, I'm going to view it with one), but I am not willing to shell out the funds to pad Moore's oh-so-very big, and American hating, pockets. On the other hand, this looks funny:  urlLink Michael Moore Hates America  2. And for all you ketchup lovers out there fretting over the fact that each bottle of Heinz helps the Kerry campaign, fear not! Now there's  urlLink W Ketchup ! I like their quote, "You don't support Democrats. Why should your ketchup?" Heh heh heh. (Note: The "W" stands for "Washington" - not the fellow in the White House.)

      A woman in Prince George, British Columbia,  urlLink won a lawsuit  against her doctor... after undergoing an abortion procedure and then finding out three months later that she was still pregnant. Thankfully the baby was born unharmed and healthy. Now, my only question is, why in the WORLD would Social Services let a mother keep a child she tried to abort? The answer is simple... people STILL do not grasp the concept that abortion is MURDER. And a failed abortion is ATTEMPTED MURDER. It's a huge deal if a mother kills her newborn child... but if she does it a week earlier during a partial-birth abortion, then it's completely fine. What happened to COMMON SENSE people?!?!?!?!? Nothing boils my blood more than abortion and the stupid people that support it. Can you tell?    What the Bible says about children:     urlLink Matthew 18:5  - "And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me."     urlLink Matthew 18:10  - "See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven."     urlLink Mark 10:13-16  - "People were bringing little children to Jesus to have Him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, He was indignant. He said to them, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.' And He took the children in His arms, put His hands on them and blessed them."      Children are PRECIOUS to God!      [Special thanks to  urlLink RadioBS  for the "heads up" on this article.]

      Lets hope that  urlLink this new ultrasound technology  can help us win the fight against abortion! It's unfortunate that it takes so much to snap people into reality that their "fetus" is not just a blob of cells... but an actual child! I have never understood that sort of reasoning... it completely lacks common sense! If anyone could see their unborn child with this technology and then choose to end their child's life, I don't know how they could live with themselves. That is beyond horrific... as is abortion in  any  circumstance and at  any  point of a woman's pregnancy.

A portable outhouse exploded Tuesday after a man who was inside it lit a cigarette.  Emergency workers said the man was not severely injured and drove himself to Clay-Battelle Community Health Center. He was later transferred to Ruby Memorial Hospital. His name and condition were not available Wednesday.  The explosion, which occurred in Blacksville, resulted from a buildup of methane gas inside the toilet's chamber.  The methane did not "take too kindly" to the lit cigarette, said a spokeswoman for Monongalia Emergency Medical Services.       Oops!

      I don't have words to describe how disgusting this article is. There is not one person alive, or who has ever lived, that can justify abortion to me. There is absolutely NOTHING about abortion either that is not 100% selfish on the mother's part. If you want to know just what abortion is all about, go to  urlLink this site  and take a look at the pictures. If you are still pro-choice after that, then may God have mercy on your soul. I wouldn't want to stand before God someday after having supported something so evil...        "WHEN ONE IS ENOUGH" By AMY RICHARDS as told to AMY BARRETT Published: July 18, 2004 I grew up in a working-class family in Pennsylvania not knowing my father. I have never missed not having him. I firmly believe that, but for much of my life I felt that what I probably would have gained was economic security and with that societal security. Growing up with a single mother, I was always buying into the myth that I was going to be seduced in the back of a pickup truck and become pregnant when I was 16. I had friends when I was in school who were helping to rear nieces and nephews, because their siblings, who were not much older, were having babies. I had friends from all over the class spectrum: I saw the nieces and nephews on the one hand and country-club memberships and station wagons on the other. I felt I was in the middle. I had this fear: What would it take for me to just slip? Now I'm 34. My boyfriend, Peter, and I have been together three years. I'm old enough to presume that I wasn't going to have an easy time becoming pregnant. I was tired of being on the pill, because it made me moody. Before I went off it, Peter and I talked about what would happen if I became pregnant, and we both agreed that we would have the child. I found out I was having triplets when I went to my obstetrician. The doctor had just finished telling me I was going to have a low-risk pregnancy. She turned on the sonogram machine. There was a long pause, then she said, ''Are you sure you didn't take fertility drugs?'' I said, ''I'm positive.'' Peter and I were very shocked when she said there were three. ''You know, this changes everything,'' she said. ''You'll have to see a specialist.'' My immediate response was, I cannot have triplets. I was not married; I lived in a five-story walk-up in the East Village; I worked freelance; and I would have to go on bed rest in March. I lecture at colleges, and my biggest months are March and April. I would have to give up my main income for the rest of the year. There was a part of me that was sure I could work around that. But it was a matter of, Do I want to? I looked at Peter and asked the doctor: ''Is it possible to get rid of one of them? Or two of them?'' The obstetrician wasn't an expert in selective reduction, but she knew that with a shot of potassium chloride you could eliminate one or more. Having felt physically fine up to this point, I got on the subway afterward, and all of a sudden, I felt ill. I didn't want to eat anything. What I was going through seemed like a very unnatural experience. On the subway, Peter asked, ''Shouldn't we consider having triplets?'' And I had this adverse reaction: ''This is why they say it's the woman's choice, because you think I could just carry triplets. That's easy for you to say, but I'd have to give up my life.'' Not only would I have to be on bed rest at 20 weeks, I wouldn't be able to fly after 15. I was already at eight weeks. When I found out about the triplets, I felt like: It's not the back of a pickup at 16, but now I'm going to have to move to Staten Island. I'll never leave my house because I'll have to care for these children. I'll have to start shopping only at Costco and buying big jars of mayonnaise. Even in my moments of thinking about having three, I don't think that deep down I was ever considering it. The specialist called me back at 10 p.m. I had just finished watching a Boston Pops concert at Symphony Hall. As everybody burst into applause, I watched my cellphone vibrating, grabbed it and ran into the lobby. He told me that he does a detailed sonogram before doing a selective reduction to see if one fetus appears to be struggling. The procedure involves a shot of potassium chloride to the heart of the fetus. There are a lot more complications when a woman carries multiples. And so, from the doctor's perspective, it's a matter of trying to save the woman this trauma. After I talked to the specialist, I told Peter, ''That's what I'm going to do.'' He replied, ''What we're going to do.'' He respected what I was going through, but at a certain point, he felt that this was a decision we were making. I agreed. When we saw the specialist, we found out that I was carrying identical twins and a stand alone. My doctors thought the stand alone was three days older. There was something psychologically comforting about that, since I wanted to have just one. Before the procedure, I was focused on relaxing. But Peter was staring at the sonogram screen thinking: Oh, my gosh, there are three heartbeats. I can't believe we're about to make two disappear. The doctor came in, and then Peter was asked to leave. I said, ''Can Peter stay?'' The doctor said no. I know Peter was offended by that. Two days after the procedure, smells no longer set me off and I no longer wanted to eat nothing but sour-apple gum. I went on to have a pretty seamless pregnancy. But I had a recurring feeling that this was going to come back and haunt me. Was I going to have a stillbirth or miscarry late in my pregnancy? I had a boy, and everything is fine. But thinking about becoming pregnant again is terrifying. Am I going to have quintuplets? I would do the same thing if I had triplets again, but if I had twins, I would probably have twins. Then again, I don't know.         [Thanks to  urlLink Dan  for the heads-up on this article from  urlLink The New York Times .]

      I just read this on another blog... isn't this nuts? How do Dems act like this and then sleep at night?        THE WONDERS OF NUANCE I just witnessed one of the best political moments of 2004. I am watching TiVos of last week's Hannity &amp; Colmes, and saw an interview with Jim Hightower. Jim Hightower said that Bush was a liar. Sean Hannity asked Hightower to respond to several quotes from "George Bush". The quotes were something along the lines of "Saddam's WMD is a direct threat to America". Those kinds of statements. And Hightower said, "Yes, absolutely, Bush is lying!" This went on for five or six quotes then Hannity had a terrific moment when he revealed that the speaker of those quotes was not George Bush but John Kerry. Hannity asked him directly if that meant that Kerry was a liar, and Hightower said no.  Ridiculous!    urlLink The Right Thinking Girl

      I recently started reading a book called "Changes That Heal", by Dr. Henry Cloud. I think it is definitely worth sharing because there are things in it that we can all learn from. I think the most powerful thing I've read so far is how we cannot experience a true faith in Christ if we don't have Grace AND Truth in our lives. A life of Grace WITHOUT Truth is a life in which everything you do is "okay" and "acceptable," but there are no guidelines. Yet a life of Truth WITHOUT Grace is a life packed full of strict rules and regulations without any acceptance of who you are for when you mess up. Both are detrimental to a person's spiritual walk... and I thought that was so interesting and SO true... because I have witnessed this first-hand even at times in my own life. This book teaches you that Jesus is all about Truth AND Grace and the only way for us to truly know Him is to live a life of both. This book explains that very well. I will re-post more comments as I finish the book, but it's definitely worth reading if you're looking for something impactful for your spiritual life! :) &nbsp;

      ...to my weblog! I don't know why people call it a "blog." Doesn't that sound bizarre? Sort of like when people refer to their parents as the "rents." Uggh. That drives me crazy. Whatever. I guess I will start out with a little background info on who I am. If you can't already tell, I am 100% Dutch and proud of it. :) Well, Dutch-American that is. I know what you're thinking. You think since I am Dutch, that I am cheap and that I secretly like to wear wooden shoes or something. Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that really isn't true. :) (If I really DID like to wear wooden shoes... I think there would be serious cause for concern.) But... there is something about me that  is  stereotypically Dutch. I am tall and I have blond(ish) hair with blue eyes. But what I identify myself with, and feel is most important about my life, is that I am a "born again" Christian. I have conservative values and believe in the basic freedoms of our great American country, but I hate to see those freedoms taken advantage of and abused... as so often is the case these days. I may elaborate on my political views from time to time in the future, but I think I am going to use this "blog" for more of an opportunity to talk about my faith and other things that I believe in. I will probably also talk about things that are going on around the world and my response to them. These weblogs are great, aren't they? It sure is nice to be able to "sound off" and get feedback from other people.   "Tot ziens" for now...

      Shortly after reading the following e-mail content, I happened to look at the label of a jar of Heinz sandwich slice pickles. Yep... "Made in Mexico." Check out some of your Heinz products...       "Sen. John Kerry keeps talking about U.S. corporations leaving this country and setting up shop in foreign countries, taking thousands of jobs with them. He is right, because that has happened. However, he is trying to blame it on George W. Bush. As far as I know, Bush has not moved one factory out of this country because he is not the owner of a single factory. That cannot be said about Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz-Kerry.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the Kerry's own 32 factories in Europe and 18 in Asia and the Pacific. In addition, their company, the Heinz Company, leases four factories in Europe and four in Asia.  Also, they own 27 factories in North America, some of which are in Mexico and the Caribbean. 80% of Heinz products are made overseas. I wonder how many hundreds of American workers lost their jobs when these plants relocated in foreign countries. I also wonder if the workers in Mexico and Asia are paid the same wages and benefits as workers in the United States.  Of course they're not. However, Kerry demands that other companies that relocate should pay the same benefits they did in the U.S. Why does he not demand this of the Heinz Company, since he is married to the owner? If Kerry is elected, will he and his wife close all those foreign factories and bring all those jobs back to America? Of course they won't. They're making millions off that cheap labor. Thank you and make your vote count...

      Excerpts from an  article on FoxNews.com :                  The California Supreme Court today said   no   to gay marriage and invalidated all the marriage licenses granted by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. Sorry, Rosie O'Donnell. ...in the year 2000, Californian's passed  Proposition 22 , which said marriage in California can be legal only between a man and woman. That proposition passed by an astounding 62 to 38 percent in the nation's most liberal state. So it's clear the residents of California and all over the U.S.A. want to keep traditional marriages law. But Mayor Newsom didn't really care about that, citing civil rights legislation. He put himself above the will of the people. And that's happening all over the U.S.A. Judges and politicians are saying we know best. You don't really count. Thank God, with apologies to the ACLU, that California's Supreme Court is still ruling on the law.         I'm glad that the California Supreme Court is smart enough to recognize the dangers of granting marriage to gay couples. As "harmless" as it may seem to gay-marriage supporters, gay marriage could cause serious problems in our society. Those in favor of gay marriage feel that people who oppose it are simply opposed because of bigotry and ignorance. However, this is not at all true. In countries where gay marriage has been legal for years already, there have been shifts in society that have been detrimental to families. The sanctity of marriage has been destroyed. Take a look at the following article, " Eleven Arguments Against Same-Sex Marriage ." I think it does an amazing job of helping us understand how the legalization of gay marriage could destroy our society. Remember, God hates sin, but loves the sinner. He wants us to recognize our sin and admit our faults, so we can stand humble before Him. He will only welcome us into heaven if we make the personal choice to accept Him as our Savior and to denounce our sins. We will still be subject to sinful temptation and we will fail at times, but He knows this. We, as humans, are not perfect, but we can be made whole in God's image if we accept His gift of Salvation. I know many people, even through my church, that have struggled with the temptation of homosexuality. But it is a temptation that is sinful and unnatural and they now recognize that. Because it is a sin that many choose to define themselves by, it separates them from the love of God. To receive God's grace and mercy, you only need ask for it. But you may have to give up something (or some things) that you have strongly held onto for years that you have eventually allowed to define you. Do not let sin define your life! You will only find true peace in your heart if you let go of your sins and let God lead you in the direction He has already chosen for you. Don't let our society convince you that living by your own standards is okay/acceptable and that a sinful lifestyle is a healthy lifestyle... because it's a lie. A lifestyle defined by sin only brings heartache and pain and a deep longing for something more... a void that can only be filled by God's love. And God does love you... no matter what you have done! He is waiting for you to recognize this and to turn to Him for help, love, and redemption. Pray.

       Robert Novak  critiques both the  book  and the man:        I have read the book and found it is neither the political propaganda nor the urban legend that its detractors claim. It is a passionate but meticulously researched account of how Kerry went to war, what he did in the war and how he conducted himself after the war. The very serious charges by former comrades deserve answers but so far have produced only ad hominem counterattacks. The book's strength is the vehemence of testimony by swift boat veterans, alleging that Kerry "gamed" the system to win decorations and later betrayed comrades by charging war crimes…. Some 200 "Swiftees" on May 4 signed a letter to Kerry demanding full release of his service records. Why should details of what Kerry did more than 30 years ago be part of this election campaign? Only because the senator has made them integral to his strategy. Kerry as a war hero received more attention at the Democratic National Convention than his plans for the future. Thus, what he did in his shortened four months of combat becomes a valid campaign issue….  Unfit for Command  sends a devastating message, unless effectively refuted. Perhaps most disturbing are allegations that are unjustified.       Wouldn't it make more sense for Kerry to address this head-on instead of turning his lawyers loose on TV stations showing the veterans’ ad? I mean, hello? If the allegations are true, admit it! If not, sue for libel! Kerry took full advantage of the First Amendment when he bad-mouthed his country after Vietnam... and now the tables have turned. The same amendment is now protecting the media’s (and the veterans') right to show political ads. Sorry Kerry! You lose again. Amen.

      Some twisted humor:  “I am a senior citizen. During the Clinton Administration I had an extremely good and well-paying job. I took numerous vacations and had several vacation homes. Since President Bush took office, I have watched my entire life change for the worse. I lost my job. I lost my two sons in that terrible Iraqi War. I lost my homes. I lost my health insurance. As a matter of fact I lost virtually everything and became homeless.  Adding insult to injury, when the authorities found me living like an animal, instead of helping me, they arrested me. I will do anything that Senator Kerry wants to insure that a Democrat is back in the White House come next year. Bush has to go.  I just thought you and your readers would like to know how one senior citizen views the Bush Administration. Thank you for taking time to read my letter.  Sincerely yours,  Saddam Hussein”   [From  urlLink La Shawn Barber ]

                 This pertains to the Swift Boat sailors that I mentioned  earlier . Their  new book  will be released on August 15, 2004. This article from  NewsMax.com  offers some tantalizing highlights...        A new book written by the Swift Boat sailors who served with John Kerry in Vietnam offers a devastating critique of his military record. According to Drudge Report, "Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry," written by John O'Neill and Jerome R. Corsi, adds new details to revelations about Kerry's record. Among the bombshells Drudge reports: ~ All three of Kerry's Purple Hearts were for minor injuries, not requiring any hospitalization, and two were self-inflicted. ~ A "fanny wound" was the highlight of his Bronze Star. ~ Kerry filed a false report to exploit the death of a Vietnamese father and child as an act of "heroism." ~ He burned an abandoned Vietnamese village and slaughtered the civilians' livestock. "Kerry's reckless behavior convinced his colleagues that he had to go - becoming the only Swift Boat veteran to serve only four months," Drudge reported. "Unfit for Command," scheduled for release Aug. 15, could do as much damage to Kerry as the entire year's packed lineup of Bush-bashing movies and books has done to the president. O'Neill, who served with John Kerry in Vietnam and has been exposing the Massachusetts Democrat's military record ever since, has terrified Kerry's presidential campaign with the explosive new book. As NewsMax has reported, O'Neill, a leader of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, has: ~ Forced Kerry in 1971 to admit he never witnessed the war crimes he had accused U.S. troops of committing.      Stated at a news conference last month: --> "We resent very deeply the false war crimes charges he made coming back from Vietnam in 1971 and repeated in the book 'Tour of Duty.'" --> "We think those cast an aspersion on all those living and dead, from our unit and other units in Vietnam." --> "We think that he knew he was lying when he made the charges, and we think that they're unsupportable. We intend to bring the truth about that to the American people." --> "We believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit to be the Commander-in-Chief."      ~ Pointed out that despite the show staged at the Democrat convention, most of the officers in Kerry's division have signed a public letter saying he's unfit to lead. ~ Accused Kerry of exaggerating and even faking his wounds. "He literally is a guy who parades around and pretends to be something he's not," O'Neill said.      "He was in Vietnam for four months; everyone else was there for a year. He obtained three Purple Hearts from self-inflicted wounds. And then he left."      ~ Urged Kerry to stop exploiting photos of fellow soldiers, many of whom oppose his candidacy. ~ Revealed how Kerry's campaign has tried to muzzle Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. O'Neill has explained:  "It's his self-promotion that infuriates most of the people from his unit who actually know what he did. He would be a terrible commander in chief of U.S. forces in the world at a time of crisis."        It's no surprise to me that the Democrats are scrambling to stop this book from being published. All this from the people that knew John Kerry  best  during his infamous "tour of duty?" This should be revelational news to those that support Kerry. Uh-oh Democrats... time for some damage control!

      GREAT article  written by Brian . This is pretty much what I believe the Democratic party stands for...         Why I am a conservative – Part 1 Subtitle: Why I’m not a Liberal Democrat.  I could never be a Liberal Democrat. They believe that morals, values, and truth are subjective terms. This line of thinking dictates that people should decide for themselves what their morality should be, that the truth is how they see it and each person's truth is equally valid. These statements are their foundation for their ill-conceived doctrine of tolerance. They are tolerant of everything except for those who are intolerant of their way of thinking. This type of thinking is for the most basic Neanderthal mind. No thought is required after being indoctrinated with this mindset. All debate ceases to exist because they automatically assume that anything said has the same intrinsic value as their own opinion. There is no truth but your own. The fact that opinions can be wrong is of no concern to them. In Chuck Colson’s book “How Now Shall We Live” he demonstrates the pervasiveness of this mindset when he described a speech he gave to a prominent State University. He imagined before he began his speech that what he was about to say, would provoke many questions and much debate, but instead it produced blank stares and no responses. So as his speech went on he made his stance even more definitive and more exclusionary to provoke a response. He did not get one. It wasn’t because he failed in brining his point across, it was because, as a professor told him earlier, the children had been so indoctrinated with moral relativism and tolerance, that his words were accepted as his (Chuck’s) truth, and no one else’s. Understanding that mindset makes it easier to grasp why a liberal like John Kerry would say something like this:     "I oppose abortion, personally. I don't like abortion. I believe life does begin at conception."     And then in the same breath say this:     "I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an atheist," he continued in the interview. "We have separation of church and state in the United States of America."     You see? His statement that life begins at conception is not something he honestly believes is true for everyone all of the time. If he did, he would sign legislation banning the practice of all abortion because he would value life. He would support that unborn child’s right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This mindset unifies them. It is their rock on rollers. It is their single truth that they hold fast to. And since this is true, it is impossible to legislate conservative morality because it makes definitive statements like “Marriage is between a man and a woman”. To a liberal this is black and white thinking in a world where truth is subjective. How dare we impose our morality on them? I wish that were the worst of it. Five years ago gay marriage would have been unthinkable. Yet here we are today. Why? Is it because truth has changed? Remember there is no truth except for what they currently feel is acceptable today. The goal post can and will move at their whim. Now, to them, the truth is that homosexual marriage should be allowed. Thousands of years of tradition will soon be cast aside. I have no doubt that once America has been sufficiently worn down enough, legislation like gay marriage will look down right conservative by comparison. I could never be a part of this party as long as I’m a Christian. Although it does hold some tenants of Christianity, mostly because of the pervasiveness of our Judeo Christian upbringing, it regards truth and honesty with disdain. They believe Guns kill people, SUV’s kill people, babies are parasites, that your wealth should not be your own, minorities should have special rights, Christians are the scourge of America, America is the scourge of the world, Michael Moore tells the truth, terrorists are today’s minute men, we deserved 9/11, communism wasn’t a threat, dividing a nation is the highest form of patriotism, and flip-flopping is misinterpreted intellectualism.       You know what though? As much as I agree with this article when I read it, I can't help but think that there is a greater point that many of us are missing. If Jesus were alive today, I don't think He would want to be a part of any political party. He recognizes that there are much greater things to be worried about. Just writing this is therapeutic for me because it's making me realize how foolish our obsession with politics really is. Sure, I do believe that Republicans generally represent a much more moralistic, honest, and trustworthy society. I admire President Bush for what he has fought so hard for... and for not backing down in the face of intense scrutiny. I believe that if we never fight for what we believe in and to free oppressed people, this entire world would be a disaster. Some things ARE worth fighting for... and I think our troops and allied troops are heroes for the service they are willingly providing to our country (and for the rest of the world). But I think that people, in general, are thinking too small. There are much greater issues in the world that most probably don't even think about. We get so caught up in current events that we fail to see the "big picture." And by that, I mean ETERNITY. I believe that our society, overall, has gotten way off-track. Our country was built on the foundation of God, freedom, and honor. But in our current world of "political correctness" and such, people are breaking free from any real form of structure and responsibility... so much so that people aren't accountable for hardly anything anymore. What would have been completely unacceptable 100 years ago is now a social norm. People are so desensitized that they actually believe that killing unborn children is a "right" or a "personal choice." People are now programmed to think that anything they want to do is an innate human right... and that there are no rules or guidelines for a healthy lifestyle... not to mention consequences. It is clear that sin is tearing the world apart and blinding us to the harsh realities that we live in. I believe that if Jesus were alive as a human being today... He would do just as He did before. He would go and seek out those that needed Him most.  He despised sin but loved the sinner . Sound impossible? It's not. We are not defined by our sin... if we do not wish to be. Christ knew that we needed Salvation. And He died to offer it to us. The key word here is "offer." We are not automatically saved. You will not automatically go to heaven when you die. Your eternity lies in your own hands and in your own heart. You might have to die to yourself and to your pride to accept it, but Jesus is  offering  you Salvation... a life of eternity with Him. The only way to receive/accept His offer is to tell Him. Pray to Him. Ask for forgiveness and wholeheartedly ask Him to save your eternity! Forget about the madness of this world... think about what your "forever" holds. And then you will have a whole new perspective on life.

      Interesting article from  Newsmax.com ...         Hollywood Highlights From a Bounceless Convention  Hollywood's presence was all over the place. But at the Democrat convention, celebrity sentiments were anything but inclusive when it came to talk of Republican types. Alec Baldwin said that the GOP was "hijacked by fundamentalist whackos." Rob Reiner accused the GOP of using "wedge issues to divide the country." Janeane Garofalo called right-wingers "emotionally immature." In an accurate description of the Democrat ticket, Ben Affleck told the world that the "GOP is the party of the haves and have mores." Speaking of Moores, Michael was the most visible face at the Democrat happening. He was even able to score the seat of honor next to Nobel Prize-winning ex-prez Jimmy Carter. The Peace Prize's spirit failed to rub off on Moore. The "Dude, Where's My Conscience" said conservatives "are up at six in the morning trying to figure out which minority group they're going to screw today. The hate, they eat for breakfast. They are going to fight, and they are going to smear, and they are going to lie, and they are going to hate." Meanwhile, the Kerry daughters were playing celebrity courting. Alexandra shared smokes, jokes and kisses with John Cusack, while Ben Affleck hugged Vanessa at the GQ party for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome.  Alexandra is the same Kerry daughter who revealed in a prime-time address to the convention that her father had heroically administered CPR to the family's hamster. The Left Coast Report is pleased to hear that John Kerry is at least pro-rodent life.        I find these celebrity comments very interesting... ironic, and usually/typically hypocritical. Upon reading comments like the one above from Alec Baldwin, I wonder how he gets along with his " fundamentalist whacko " of a brother? And Janeane Garofalo's comment? When I think of someone who is emotionally mature, she certainly isn't the first person that pops into my mind. Calling Conservatives "emotionally immature" is a bit like the pot calling the kettle black, isn't it? But Ben Affleck's comment was the real winner. I actually laughed out loud at that one! (Sorry "comedienne" Janeane!) Mr. Affleck thinks that Republicans are a bunch of "haves and have mores?" Hmmm. Last time I checked, Mr. Affleck HAD much more than the average Conservative American... tangibly speaking, of course. I certainly wouldn't accuse him of HAVING or HAVING MORE of a conscience or a moral backbone than any Conservative I know...

                                  Bill O'Reilly failed in his interview with Michael Moore last week, not because Moore is right (because he is clearly NOT) but because O'Reilly accepted Moore's points of argument as something worthy to even argue about! Here is part of  Rush's take  on the “debate":        [I]n this case, the false premise that was put forth that was accepted and thereby shaped the entire interview, was, "Bush sends kids to die."  Bush sends no one to die. The Palestinians send their kids to die. The Palestinians strap bombs on their kids and send them into civilian areas in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv with the express purpose of having those explosives blow up and kill not only the kids, but as many innocent civilians as possible nearby. That is "sending your kids off to die." George Bush sends no one off to die -- kids, adults, anyone.  Yet the interview descended into, "Would you die for your country? Would you die for Fallujah?" and that's not at all an acceptable premise to me. Here's why. We have in this country a volunteer army. Since 2000, particularly 2001, everybody joining the Army knows exactly where they're going. The odds are they're going to go to combat. As such, most of them joining do so willingly. ... But the premise that any U.S. president in this day and age is "sending kids off to die" is insulting. It is banal. It is infantile. It is puerile. It is insane. It is lunatic. It is absolutely degenerate -- especially in this day and age. Now, people are free to say what they want to say, free to make a movie, do whatever they want to do, and anybody's free to glom on to it and sign on to it and say whatever they want.  But when this kind of thing is taken up by an out-of-power, scared-to-death, filled-with-fear-and-rage political party that used to once be great, and seeks to build its own identity around the lies and distortions and the efforts to ridicule and impugn fine people, then it's worthy of concern and discussion.  ... So I'm not being critical of Mr. O'Reilly here, and I don't want anybody to think this, but I think it is just a shame.  It's just an absolute shame that this kind of whatever you call this -- docudrama, propaganda, whatever it is -- is being accepted and transmitted as some sort of factual, relevant bit of news that people need to shape their lives by or grow up or get up and learn to smell the roses and the coffee, because there's some so-called new profound truth in this movie when it's nothing but distortion and lies -- and this premise that Bush is sending kids off to die, when we have a volunteer force, we have great young people who bear no resemblance to the rabble-rousers of the 1960s, their age then, who are doing this for their genuine desire to defend the country.        Amen to that!

      I thought this website was a fun new look into John Kerry's "Web O' Lies." Looks like Sen. Kerry's military record isn't quite as honorable as he has so fervently said/implied. *gasp!* Color me surprised...        Senator John Kerry has made his 4-month combat tour in Vietnam the centerpiece of his bid for the Presidency. His campaign jets a handful of veterans around the country, and trots them out at public appearances to sing his praises. John Kerry wants us to believe that these men represent all those he calls his "band of brothers." But most combat veterans who served with John Kerry in Vietnam see him in a very different light.             This photograph of John Kerry and 19 other Coastal Division 11 Swift boat officers was taken at Ton Sun Nuht Air Base on January 22, 1969, immediately following a meeting with General Abrams and Admiral Zumwalt. The Kerry campaign featured the photograph in an advertisement released in May titled  Lifetime . Swift Boat Veterans for Truth has contacted surviving members of this group to find out how many actually support John Kerry, and discovered that  of 19 Swift boat skippers pictured other than Kerry, 12 consider him unfit, 4 are neutral, two have died, and 1 is working with the Kerry campaign. Four other officers were not present for the photo session; all oppose Kerry. Only 1 of John Kerry's 23 fellow Swift boat commanders from Coastal Division 11 supports his candidacy today.                    Ouch! That's gotta hurt... but don't worry Sen. Kerry... Hill and Billary still gotchore back...
