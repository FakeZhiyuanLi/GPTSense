      darkly I love God's Weird shard - I am quite menacing her too unique Weird truth could accept our Weird mind somehow while my Weird pride could shatter my Weird enemy somehow their Weird flame should analyse their Weird wings forever his Weird blood should see his Weird entity darkly  sorrowfully you defeat her Weird chains - you are really ironic miserably you become her Weird enemy - I am really usual the Weird shard would battle their Weird disease helplessly my Weird graveyard will eat our Weird creature mystically her Weird dagger shall never glide along God's Weird eternity together her Weird wound ...

      Wrap me in chains. Clad me in leather Run the lawnmower over my hair Beat me as I do the dishes With the whipper-snipper! Tie me up with the sheets to the bed Smother me with a pillow Cut me with knives and forks Drag me across the lounge-room floor By my hair as I suck up the dirt With the vacuum cleaner Pin me to the wall with your Toyota Steal MY T.V. remote Let me hear the sound of one hand slapping Drink your beer while we make love But just DON'T call me fat.

      He walked into a bar, sat his frame upon a stool, Said to the barman, "Just give me anything that's cool! I'll have a Scotch, a Rum, a double Gin and a quart of beer. I need something to ease the pain, to stop me feeling queer."  The barman put the drinks upon the bar and shook his head, "This kinda drinkin' will make you sick. You may even wake up dead!" "Don't talk to me about being dead," the stranger said with a groan, "I've just got out of hospital and I should be headin' home! I'll have this jolt and then I'll bolt, but let me tell you what I should not be drinking this, well, not with what I've got!"  The barman looked sympathetic as he wiped the bar with a mop. "Gee, I hope it's not too bad," he said, "So tell me what have you got?"  The stranger downed the drinks real fast, said, "Set em up again, 'Tis terrible and it's rotten......Just what I've got, my friend!" The barman leant much closer, feeling sad and tense. The stranger belched and said, "What I've got......is FIFTY CENTS"

      	  Funny Poems CategorySubmit Your PoemIncome From PoetrySerch For A Poem  Introduction  A rather fishy tale!!!  Pin-Head Jack  Copyright; Tony Strauss Email: tonybushpoet@hotmail.com  I was working on the trawlers up in Gladstone some time back, When I met this codger who went by the name of Pin-Head Jack. Nick-names can be descriptive but this one was best of all, 'Cause this guy's head was smaller than a bloody tennis ball.  I wondered how it happened this deformity of his, 'Though it might cause some embarassment if him I was to quiz. One fisherman I asked said "Sorry mate, it's just too sad", Whilst others just replied "That bloke is flamin' raving mad".  Curiosity got the best of me I had to know his tale, And he said that he would tell me, if I purchased him an ale. I went straight to the nearest bar and bought the man a beer, And prepared myself to hear the saddest yarn I'd ever hear.  Old Jack lamented sorely of a time he now regrets, Of the fateful day he once had caught a mermaid in his nets. At first he thought, You beauty! This should buy me lots of beer, I could lease her out to Seaworld for a million bucks a year.  I'll buy myself a dozen pubs and every man I'll shout, I'll be the proudest man in all the world without a doubt. But the mermaid, still entangled, begged him "Sir, please set me free, And just to show my gratitude I'll grant you wishes three"  He thought of his encumbent situation, as it were, he weighed the pros, he weighed the cons, and then replied to her. "My fishing boat is in a poor delapidated mess, And I wish I had a new one so my friends I could impress".  It had happened in an instant, ere the second hand struck one, A brand new spanking trawler was now gleaming in the sun. Well old Jack was quite astounded, over-awed to say the least, This was clearly more impressive than his thoughts of hops and yeast.  Then he started thinking money and he opened up his gob' "Miss, I wish that I were wealthier than Kerry Packer's mob" And just as had occurred before, 'twas over in a flash, His brand new fishing boat was now piled high with wads of cash.  He realised with these riches, debts he would no longer care, But was dumb-struck by her beauty and her flowing locks of hair. "If I could just make love to you would be my final wish" "But Sir" she said "I'm just half girl, the other half is fish".  He pondered for a moment on his plight and then he said, "Well O.K. then, I wish that you'd give me a little head".

      Mulligan's missus was big, fat and mean A cruel and ugly man-killing machine She's the type of woman you'd be looking for If you wanted mercenaries for a guerilla war  And if he came home from the pub after six She'd beat him senseless with her thrashing stick But he was too scared to leave the old bag He was much too soft and used to wave the white flag  Well, me and the blokes, from down at the pub We'd had about enough of the way he'd been clubbed So we banded together, a vigilante team And we kept him at the pub until seven-fifteen  We pinned him in the corner though he screamed and kicked "She'll bash me bloody senseless with her thrashing stick!" "Just have another beer, Bill, she'll be alright. All of us blokes are gunna' take you home tonight"  So we piled into Darcy's ute and hit the dirt track Six clambered in the front and fourteen in the back And Mulligan was cursin', and screaming he'd be killed "Then she'll have to kill us all then" we reassured Bill  We pulled up at his house down on Jacaranda Drive Parked the ute and piled out and headed on inside We up the pathway to the door, which opened swift and quick And his missus came out screaming, and swinging that thrashing stick  She looked like a raging mallee bull, ready for the kill We formed a human barricade in front of poor old Bill "If you wanna beat your husband up, then you'll have to get on past us!" "If that's the way it is," she said, "Take this, you pack of bastards!"  And into us she swung that stick, like Bradman with a bat Old Jacko copped a hiding first and screamed like a dying cat She thrashed and flogged the lot of us, half had up and run So I staggered back to Darcy's ute and grabbed his old shotgun  "Just put that bloody stick down now!", I shouted out to her I'll pull this trigger flamin' quick, if'n you don't concur!" She dropped the stick, I looked around, and saw I was alone Everyone, 'cept Mulligan, had fled, through fear, back home  I went to pick that old stick up and break it right in half But she moved not like a heifer, she moved more like a calf And kicked me quickly in the guts and grabbed the old shotgun then said "Get out, you mongrel dog!" and shot me in the bum  Well, you've never seen a man move such, with buckshot in his bum I near on broke the speed of light, as up the road I run And the last thing I saw looking back was Mulligan on the ground Being caned near dead with that big old stick that she'd been wielding 'round  Well the story of that night became a legend in our town How Mulligan's old missus, knocked twenty of us down And she's got a thriving business now, wouldn't it make you sick! She opened a shop and sold our wives a bloody thrashing stick!  So the pub is rather quiet now I think we're still in shock We have an alarm hooked to the bar, that goes off at six-o'clock And all us blokes and Mulligan, go screaming for the door For fear of having to face up to that thrashing stick once more!

      Cold Hard Facts  Copyright; Charlee Marshall  “Move closer to the wall, my son, and speak into the grille Confession is the saviour of the soul If there’s something on your conscience, if you’re feeling weak or ill Confess... and ye shall once again be whole! Ask the lord for his salvation, he is waiting for your call” “I’m afraid I’ve sinned too greatly” said the voice behind the wall.  “Let’s see if I have got it straight - your wife... her name is Liza She’s inclined to wear her dresses rather short She was bending over looking for an ice cream in the freezer When you, behind her, had this lustful thought She had to lean way over, for she isn’t very tall...” “And I wanted chocolate brickle” said the voice behind the wall.  “Now, I know you’re newly-married (since you made your vows before us) But married people often act up thus It sometimes spoils the pleasure if the sex is too decorous So I see no reason why to make a fuss Perhaps your wife objected... did she try to start a brawl?” “No... I think she rather liked it” said the voice behind the wall.  “Then go, my son, I find no blame... your actions may be kinky Tell Liza to be careful with her dress Next time she looks for ice cream to wear something long and slinky Then her husband will have nothing to confess We will not throw you out of church... I find no sin at all...” “Well they threw us out of Woolworths!” said the voice behind the wall.

      Boobs (subtitled: Points North) (sub-subtitled: Thanks for the Mammaries)  Oh I wish I had boobs that would wobble Mine just stay still in one place In the breast hall of fame You won't see my name For my boobs there would be a disgrace  Sure boobs of my size have their merit They're easy to fit with a bra And when I go for a dip You won't see one slip…out They stay put…just where they are  And I'm not one to seek much attention So you won't find me strutting about In a boob tube that's trying by gravity defying to leave no room, not even for doubt  But I sure envy big breasted women I've seen them at parties you know With all confidence thrust In their mighty big bust Entrancing the men as they go  Though I've heard from a big bosomed buddy That it's not all it's cracked up to be She says in frustration "Try to hold conversation When there's only two things a guy sees"  Now if I paid a few grand to enlarge them To, say thirty-six b or c Would they still look so natural And could I class them as collateral Sorta like home improvements on me  Now I've not taken this boob thing just lightly I've done quite a bit of research As I try to keep abreast In my mammary quest I've found there's a bit to be learned  There's questions that need to be answered Like cleavage, how wide and how deep I can have nipples bigger But somehow I figured That could poke Sweetie's eye in his sleep  Oh, I wish I had boobs that were awesome I'd buy a bright red bathing suit On the beach I would run In slow motion for fun To show off my best attribute  Now don't think I'd just get them for vanity There's much I'd aspire to do I could feed many babies When I was lactating And for convenience, I could offer drive-thru  In a t-shirt I'd test air conditioning They could 'see' if they had it too low And if I stood outside My breasts pumped up with pride Police'd use me to stop traffic flow  Well you can see I've a lot to consider For the big plunge, I need some more time So I'll keep you updated But for now they're just fated To stay as they are for a while  And there's my sweetie who totally accepts me For he loves each and every little…bit He says "stay as you are You're the most beautiful by far" As he gazes into my eyes…not my tits

      In Toronto, an unemployed man almost carried out his plan to kill people at a power plant and then randomly kill citizens so he'd get life in prison.  He came so close to doing the deed that he had all the safeties and locks removed from his weapons (scope powered rifles, magnums), but he stopped because a dog in the park wouldn't leave him alone. He was a dog lover and had a change of heart.  After the police arrested him, they searched his car and found the weapons cache, medication wrappers, and Mariah Carey, the Doors, Abba and Judas Priest CDs.  Moral of the story... never mix Mariah Carey with Judas Priest. I hate to think what would have happened if it was Celine Dion and Marilyn Manson.   urlLink Site
