"i dunno what do u wanna do?" "i dunno what do u wanna do?" "i dunno what do u wanna do?" "ok, u have to choose something" "choose wut?" "choose something to do-- "out of wut?"

      Fun Fun!!! i got to go to a car wash and raise money for the teen financial aid thing for our summer camp. it was fun even though we didn't really make that much money. there was no set price so some people gave us loads of money. this one dude gave us a 20! it was awesome. i got to spend time with some of the other teens too. being new and all is kinda weird. i'v seen these people every week for so many years but never got to really talk to them.  my carpet is installed! i get to sort thru evrything i have and throw tons of it away! fun!! not. i guess i need to throw it away tho. my room was getting so crapped up. it smells kinda weird too...

           Yet another beautiful summer's day spent...sleeping and cleaning. The smell of all-purpose-cleaning-solution-pinesol is in the air and all that can be seen are gleaming toilets and sparkling sinks. but behind all that spotless porcelin (however u spell it) is me. me scrubbing and wiping things that i would preferably not wipe at all, and ignore comepletely.       Yes, life is fun during the summer. especialy since my bro's gone for most of everyday. funny, i haven't drank a snapple in about a month and now that it's summer i've been gulping them down like i wanted to drown in them...interesting how a little free time makes one thirsty. anyway one summer's day down, two and a half months to go...

      hey people,  or anyone who's reading this. Yes, i am starting a new blog at the same address! my other one got too crowded so i thot, why not make a new one?. and here i am doing so. i doubt there is a single person in the entire world even reading this. tho i may be wrong...anyway the summers here and i already miss softball...so sad. finally my brother had a shred, a *tiny* spark of intelligence so he got a job. amazing huh? he actually is doing something productive! while i'm stuck at home doing nothin except typing this blog...LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. i solemnly swear that i will never put any song lyrics in here at anytime since it is one of the most annoying things i noticed while reading my old blog. sorry people for that!!!

       As I said in my earlier post, i am getting a cell phone, which was supposed to arrive today and did. except for the fact that no one was at home to sign for it. that happened because my mom invited these people to town and their flight got delayed so she was late driving them to their hotel. she forgot me entirely at softball camp until i called her half an hour after the camp ended. she then picked me up at 12:45 even though it had ended early at 11:50. so then instead of driving me home she decided to run a few errands. after that we finally got home at about 1:05 or so. unfourtunatly my phone had arrived at 12:19.&nbsp;Which brings me to the conclusion that if my mom had picked me up&nbsp;ON-TIME instead of almost an hour late. we would've made it home to get my phone. or if she hadn't invited those people in the first place. &nbsp;and to make matters worse for herself she then got all pissy at me when she thot i was blaming it on her when i wasn't even though i am now. so she "sent" me to my room where i am now typing the true story of how she screwed up. i like being in my room anyway so it's not like she did anything worthy of praise.

      Well i'm back again. ya so itz been oh 2 weeks since i last wrote...so what? the last 2 days i have been going to a softball camp that my mom signed me up for called Beaver Softball...i guess that's what Ballard Highscool's mascot is. The pitcher from my softball team during the season was going to come according to her friend that's there, but she had to "babysit". i don't know anyone there. it's fun though. even tho i am more sore now than i have ever been in my entire life.  last week i ordered a catcher's mitt online from Easton. it just arrived today and seems like it's really going to be hard breaking it in. oh ya, and also my momsaid she was switching the plan we had from tmobile to a family plan and we "qualified" for a free cell phone so im getting a cell phone finally!!! happy! kinda...that will arrive tomaro orthe day after that hopefully. it's one of those nokia phones like my brothers just better and newer.
