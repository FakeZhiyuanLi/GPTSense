      ASHLEE SIMPSON LYRICS  "Pieces Of Me"  On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you And the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me  Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care When I'm angry, you listen When youre happy, it's a mission And you wont stop 'til I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast Well, I hit that bottom Crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face... I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms... So I can breathe  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...   um that's my favorite song right now!! luv {.::.)/aDrIeNnE\(.::.}

      You say you want to "just be friends"  You dont want me to cry  But you cant even bring yourself  To look me in the eye  How can I be friends with you  When I love you so much  And every time I close my eyes  I remember your soft touch  Why did you say you loved me  If you knew it would end like this?  Then I hear myself ask you  For one last goodnight kiss  As you lean down towards my face  A tear falls from my eye  I remember all we'd been through  Now I have to say good-bye  How rage flows through my veins  Just as your lips brush my cheek  You broke my heart in pieces  Now I see that I was weak  I've changed alot since then  Sometimes I still think of you  Now I dont feel love or hate  For the boy who broke my heart in two....:(  *WhY Do I BoThEr, WhY Do I CaRe, WhY Do I SeE YoU EvErYwHeRe... WhY Am I SaD, WhY Do I CrY,  WhY DoN'T I JuSt LeT DaYz Go By... WhY Do I LoVe YoU As MuCh As I Do, WhEn YoU DoN't LoVe Me As I LoVe YoU...

Long away messages are tedious, unfunny, and stupid, and you wonder what on earth is wrong with the person writing it. I mean, it's like, must there be this long of a message to get the stupid point across? How hard can it be to simply say, I'm away?
