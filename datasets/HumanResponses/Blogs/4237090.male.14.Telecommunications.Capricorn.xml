      .... and not because of football....  I watched the 10,000m race today on the Olympics. Holy GOD those guys have stamina! If I ran that thing, I'd have three glasses of water by the 5th lap, and I'd be out by lap 10. But these Ethiopian guys are superhumans! None of them even grabbed a sponge! They went all 25 freakin laps around that beast of a track, and they got a little winded. Running 50 yards gets me a little winded....  Oh, man, do I have a new respect for the crazy Olympians who did that. Hats off to you guys.  I got tired just WATCHING them. Whoa!

      JoJo, the 13-year-old girl who has the AT40 hit "Leave (Get Out)" that's at #1 for five weeks now, is retarded.  She has no clue what she's singing about. She doesn't know the sting of being cheated on. She doesn't know the true love. The only love she knows about is 'OMG he iz soo hott' puppy love, none of this soul mate stuff. It's this way with all teenage girls: every guy they have a crush on is thier 'soul mate'. Hey, you can't have 30+ soul mates! Get a grip on reality!  She doesn't even make the song believable! If someone like Usher or someone older sang something like this, I'd believe 'em. But not JoJo, because she's 13 freaking years old.

      Okay, you guys, I haven't been on in a couple days, and I'll tell you why. I started football on Monday, and after the first practise, my thighs have been hurting so bad that it's everything I could do to just walk from the couch to the bathroom! Plus, everytime I got home, I fell asleep on the couch, and woke up just in time to go to work. Lucky I only work Monday-Wednesday, or else I'd really be screwed  All I can say now is that I hope baseball is better than football.  Now's a good day to start an injury update, so I will, and you can't stop me, so there....  Well, to start out, I have football starting at 8 in the freakin morning, so my first injury is misstepping and stretching out a bit too far. You guys should know how I feel, girls just wouldn't understand; I was near splits, and I wasn't meant to go that far down. I sat out for a couple drills. I was first injury of the season [this is the third day!]  Next injury: since I'm a lineman, we have this drill to help us get low and stay low. It's a chute sort of thing; there's four slots, and bars about 4-5 feet high. And obviously I get too high going into my block stance; I nailed my helmet dead on into that 4-5 foot bar. I was alright for the moment; I walked it off for a couple drills. But at the 30 minute break [it's a two a day practise: 8-10:15am practise, 10:15-10:45am break, 10:45am-12n practise] I had a wicked headache and I was getting woozy. Apparently that's the beginning signs of a concussion. I never finished practise; I was able to stay and listen, but I couldn't do any of the drills.  As I'm typing, my headache is worse, but I was told not to take anything for it. It should go away in a little while. If I wake up nausiated and throwing up, or just with the awful headache, I should be at the doctor's in no time. So I hope I don't have a concussion; we still have to go over so many plays that if I miss one day, I'm screwed.  So, other than that, I need prayer. The grocery store that my dad has been working for for almost 20 years is closing in September. They've been losing money for 4 years, and they couldn't fund it any more.  So I guess that's it for now...

      Oh my freakin God...  What has the world come to when table tennis has become an Olympic sport?  When someone says 'Olympics' you think of track and field, swimming, volleyball, basketball, and other mainstream sports. So why the crap is table tennis an Olympic sport? They won't let bowling or golf be sports, but table tennis!! That takes very little skill! You hit a little plastic ball across the table. The only challenge is hitting the ball! Even bowling takes strategy!  In bowling, you gotta hit your mark just right, or you don't get strikes. When you miss your mark, you gotta adjust ball speed, where you're standing, your arm motion, or any other assorted things.  In table tennis, you smack a ball 1" in diameter across the table, hoping like crazy the other person misses.  Some may make the argument, "But table tennis is just like regular tennis, only smaller!" To that, I say, " Bullcrap!"    In regular tennis, you run to the ball when it goes where you aren't. The 'court' for table tennis is a little over three feet wide. You could stand in one spot and still be good at it!  The Olympics have gotten way out of hand. They used to be a joy to watch. Sadly, now they've added sports that have nothing to do with what it means to be a true Olympian...       EDIT: Upon recent research it seems that table tennis has been an Olympic sport for coming on 20 years, or something. I still stand by my opinion, but I guess I should do more research when it comes to stuff like this.

      The Olympics are in Greece, so what better way to let people see them than to put the events on 5 different channels [NBC, USA, Telemundo, Bravo, and MSNBC]?  Personally, I think that Australia will be dominant in swimming. From what I saw [400m Individual Medly and 400m Relay Medly], Australia is hot! Congrats to Michael Phelps on winning the gold, but the Aussies will take home at least 5 golds in this competition.  The USA needs to work on its rings and pommelhorse. I forget who it was, but some USA Olympian, who had previously hurt his back and needed steriods to calm it down, absolutly friggin SUCKED on the rings. Every pose you have to hold for two seconds, right? Then how come thing guy got a 9.1 rating for holding three poses for a total of two seconds? Come on; that's a diss to the Hamm brothers, of whom they actually DESERVED their score.  The event I'm looking forward to most is the rowing. But, alas, that's on at 1 in the friggin morning. So I guess I have to wait for the recap.  The best part of the Olympics so far is the Russian gymnastics, more specifically the parallel bars. Again, I don't know who he was, but a Russian Olympian dislocated his finger after landing wrong on it. And it was very wrong; his middle finger was bent at a 90 degree angle so it was crossed over his ring finger. That was the COOLEST, mainly because my mom has no tolerance for that kind of stuff, and it was humourous to watch her squirm while watching that.

       Well, here I am. This is my first of what I hope to be many blogs.  Just a few things I'm absolutely nit-picky about: - Please type legiblly. If I have to read any posts that contain less than three real words, but it's an entire post, you shall be banished to my underworld where you have to take grammar classes for all eternity! Muahaha! - Use as little cussing as possible. The occasional minor curse [stuff that can be said at TV-PG ratings] is acceptable, but if I get F-bombs, look above. - Be as honest as possible when leaving comments. I love critique, so go ahead and nit-pick at what you like.  That's it for now. Other than this, enjoy my blogs. I'll give you humour, debate, and just random thoughts.
