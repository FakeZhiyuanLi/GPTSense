      As much as I read about Nick and Jessica in US, or just have to have the latest shoes in Cosmo, I'm actually suprised it's taken me this long to catch on to the wonderful world of blogging... but here I am.  I'll probably be adding most of my entries while sitting here at work (Mayor Mike Ragsdale's office.)  Mayor Mike got his budge passed yesterday,so we can finally relax in the office. I'm working on Billy Stokes campaign for state senate(if anyone is interested in volunteering, let me know!)   I had a very interesting weekend... you can just imagine what I did, if you know me that well.  Let's see... Thursday, I was informed that I acted like a "spoiled freshman southern sorority brat."  I doubt it was from the fact that I threw up in Cool Beans bathroom, or maybe it was because I elbowed this jerk in the chest as hard as I could.  Oh well, it was fun!  Friday I had to call in to work due to my alcohol poisoning (which you'd think I would be used to by now).  Later on, I met Knox County GOP chairman Chad Tindell at Toddy's.  I was being harassed by this old guy who wants to open up a dude ranch.  He has this western show all planned out where my friend Bethany is going to be the Indian girl riding a horse, and I"m going to be the little plantation girl that gets kidnapped.  I thought it was rather amusing.  Saturday I was proud of myself... I stayed up till 7 am in the hot tub with my roomies and some neighbors... I lost count of how much beer I actually drank.  Funny thing was, I don't remember seeing the sunrsie, but somehow I just noticed it was light.  To anyone reading this, have a great Memorial Day weekend... I'm going to Cinci... yet another one of my "wild" college friends is getting married and my little baby cousin is graduating high school!  God... I'm getting old!

      I just have a few words about Michael Moore. I first discovered this guy last fall semester in my Cultural Anthropology class. Since this class was taught by a democratic, tree-hugging hippie, we often had to watch some of his films and write papers on them. After seeing Bowling For Columbine, I was pissed about the way he portrayed owners of guns. I also thought him being a traitor to American when he went to Cananda to interview why they thought Americans were so violent. All I know is that he if he thinks America is so bad, why doesn't he go somewhere else to live? Maybe him and John Kerry can get together with the rest of Hollywood and promote French films in America... what do you think?I also think that he is just making himself look bad, since there have been so many discrepencies between what he calls "fact" and what really took place. He tries to make President Bush look stupid, when actually the only one who is looking stupid is him. I think it's awesome how Bush is being praised at being the "smart" one this time by handing over Iraq to their goverment early to fool the terrorists. Great Job W!

      I actually worked 17 hours yesterday!!!  And I realized I only got 3 hours of sleep.  I am so extremely exhausted.  Isn't it amazing how you can stay out all night partying, go to class the next day, and it not even phase you?  But, if you were actually doing something productive, then you feel like you're dying.  My dad sent me some really cool photos of "Things the news won't publish."  They're really touching pics of the "real American" soldiers in Iraq, the ones who are fighting for our country and who care about freedom.  Of course, you won't see these on a major CNN headline.  I had a great weekend in Cinci... I've attached a pic of my girls and I at the wedding. (by the way, I miss them so much... I am soooooooooooo ready to get the hell outta k-town!). Cinci was a blast, but I realized how ghetto downtown was when we were walking on the sidewalk and these two gangs were fist fighting right as we walked by.  Oh, yeah, and the Westin hotel staff probably thinks I'm the biggest idiot... they even recognized my voice when I called the front desk! I told them the wrong room name for the valet parking, the wrong number for the luggage, and then I kept calling down there wondering why in the world my luggage wasn't in the room.  Cheryl's wedding was gorgeous... open bar, beautiful Catholic church, and of course, all those adorable (and cocky) Italian boys.HMMMM... sounds like what my wedding's going to be like.  Also, there is a pic of my adorable little cousins and me.  They are so grown up!:( I love having a huge family... I found out over the weekend that my third cousin is an actor on a soap opera!  My cousin's neighbor is going to UT in the fall.  Of course, I tried to act so excited for him and talked like k-town was the best place on Earth.  Give me a break... I didn't want to scare the poor boy! Oh yeah, trying to find an apartment is a bitch.  My friends Jamie and Sus are moving in with me, and it is so hard to find something in the fort that we like. It will be a blast, though, just like 3's company.  Jamie, if you read this... Sus and I control the house!  Later, people... sleep is needed!

      I swear!&nbsp; If I have to attend one more bridal shower or wedding of one of my college friends, I'm going to scream!&nbsp; Actually, I love weddings... just sometimes it gets depressing remembering the "good ole days" of when these girls used to be wild.&nbsp; I remember Cheryl in Cancun and Wren in the Bahamas.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I"m extrememly happy for them.&nbsp; It all just seems to be happening at once.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp; At least I know I &nbsp;won't have to go thru this until I"m 32.&nbsp; I don't know where I came up with that number, but I guess God told it to me in my dreams.&nbsp; The one thing I do love about weddings... open bar!&nbsp; Ha, ha.&nbsp; That's not the only thing.&nbsp; Both Cheryl and Wren both seem extrememly happy and I got to see so many of my friends and sorority sisters that I haven't seen in a really long time.&nbsp; The only thing that sucked about seeing them, was that all of them kept asking me what I was up to and why am I still in k-town!&nbsp; God... do you know how bad it sucked to tell them, that yes... I"m still here at UT working at good ole Buffalo Wild Wings!&nbsp; Oh well, only one more football season of making good tips!

      Oh my God... I can't tell yall how much I absolutely LOVE Chicago!!!  I went last weekend to visit my old UT roomies (KK and Tiffs), and I fell in love with the windy city.  The first day I was there, I was depressed.  It was cold, windy, and rainy.  But, Karen assured me this was not the normal weather.  Karen's apartment is absolutely awesome... it's on Lakeshore Dr. and it overlooks the city (which stretched for miles and miles and never seemed to end).  I'll post my pics as soon as I get them developed.  The bars there are pretty cool... they're kinda like the bars here in good ole K-town, except with a lot of cute (and better dressed) northern boys.  Michegan Avenue shopping was definitely the highlight of my trip... let's just say that they have all of the stores I adore, except way better sales than in Atlanta (where I normally do all my shopping).  Lake Michegan is gorgeous, and I loved the weather for the rest of the weekend.  It was sunny and breezy... not muggy and humid like Tennessee's unpredictable weather.  That town definitely has a lot to offer a girl... but it is a tad bit expensive to live there.  I'd have to find a really, really good job before making "the big move."  Oh, and one thing that really got on my nerves was that everywhere I went... and I"m talking about EVERYHERE... everyone asked if I was from Georgia or South Carolina.  Do they not know Tennessee is in the South?  I know I have a very strong southern accent, but hello?  Some people could not get over it!  I was asked in the bathroom at a bar, in a gas station, and even at the airport getting my luggage!  Which, by the way, I am never flying out of Nashville again!  It was way too much of a hassle.  But, overall Chicago was really wonderful!  I'm definitely considering it on my search of jobs at Monster.com!
