       :: DELICIOUS OTHER ::     Timeline:  Present   There are Epics that include Legends,  Myths that create Heroes...  There are Nocturnes adorned with stars,  Nights enlightened with Darkness...  There is the Unkown craving to be discovered,  The Known better be forgotten...  There is the silence within cacophony,  And the nonsense in the seemingly sensible...  For all those wish to see,  There is the ingenuinity versus honesty,  Which can be more real than anything can be...   Then again, I'll be talking about none of those. My overjoy mingles with an equally striking sense of longing.... for my best friend.   You probably have experienced it at one time or another... during those times you just want noone else, to be nowhere else but by the side of that person who knows and understands you better than anyone. Initially, I was mistaken to think that such feelings can only be achieved via a lover. Who wouldn't? All forms of art convey us that such emotions can only be triggered by the arrows of Eros. On the contrary, though, anything else but love does the trick. To tell you the truth, if one is letting himself/herself to form such a special bond only through affection towards a partner, I believe that one is suppressing a good deal of positive energy.   It takes a lot of time to be best friends.... years of laughter sharing, tear shedding, misunderstanding and chilling out together. Also countless hours of video games, movies, conversing, cooking, searching, giggling, gossiping, singing, drinking, writing, reading, experiencing, experimenting, loosing, winning, searching hope, finding hope, getting angry with hope, killing hope, pitying then resurrecting hope, looking for what to do with hope, deciding not to do anything with hope but end up doing everything together.   Then fate decides to challenge this togetherness and sets the best friends apart geographically. One remains behind and the other crosses cities, a continent, then an ocean and lands on the other side of the globe while the other waves her goodbye and tries to stand on her ground in her absence.   Eventually, she does... and soon realizes the oceans, the fish and algae in those oceans, the continents bordering those oceans, the societies that create the countries on those continents, the peoples of those countries that make those societies (For the very confused, simply the distance in between) can never alter the fact she is the most precious gift that has ever been presented to her by her life.   Life goes on for the both of them... The adjustability of the human psyche runs to aid. Except during those times when a time of the year or a moment carries along a memory which has a special meaning just for these two arrives.   Millers are ready my delicious other. Your unavailability does not mean you are absent from my side. Thus, my longing has nothing to with grief. Just like every year, I will be double celebrating the coming day...   ...which will mark itself as the start of a brand new year,  and your 25th birthday!!   May this chapter be the most exciting ever!   Happy New Year to everyone who has stopped by at Phantasmemoria this day.  I wish the pages of 2004 turn to make everything you ever desire come true.   Until next year...

       :: PARTIAL REVELATION ::     Timeline:  Past  So let me give a break to this story for the time being and invite you to a session about the mystification behind my pseudonym, Aura (Mars). Some may not have given it a second thought, others probably disregarded it but allow me to tell you that there are only a few things in life that I do just for the sake of doing. Personally, I love mystifications and this site is heavily founded upon these altered realities.   There are two implications to Aura in Greek mythology. According to the first myth, Aura was a beautiful Phyrgian maiden. She was believed to run with the speed of the wind and was one of the companions of Artemis, The Goddess of Moon and Hunting. Dionysus, the God of Wine, fell in love with her yet, He could capture her by no means. Thus, Aphrodite interfered and made Aura desire Dionysus hence she gave birth to Dionysus' twins. Then again, Aphrodite's spell backfired and caused Aura to linger in a delirious state which resulted in her slaughtering her infant children before throwing herself into the river Sangarius (a river in Asia Minor flowing into the Black Sea). She was then transformed into a fountain by Zeus.   Obviously, this one I try not to associate myself with. I may cause a storm made up of tears and, possessing the famous allegoric arrows of a Sagittarian, sarcastic demogogy when I am really hurt but delirium would be taking it a little too far.   The second myth of Aura is the one I truly love, indeed. According to some, Aura is the Goddess of the morning breeze. A corresponding myth describes her as being the daughter of Boreas (North Wind). Some say she is the daughter of Aiolus, King of Winds. She is often depicted riding upon a flying Swan.   Now this part is important when my favorite form of narrative style, ie. free association, is concerned. I always referred to myself and my transition into my actual self as becoming a Swan. You all probably recall the famous tale "The Ugly Duckling" by Hans Christien Andersen. Many stories of gender dysphoria include such apprehensions. The most popular of these smilies are Butterflies (thus it makes me laugh every time Mariah Carey shoves her obsession for this symbol/creature in our face) and Unicorns. When my life is considered, I very much feel it resembles the transformation of the ugly duckling into the beautiful swan.   Thus, Aura turned into a mythical persona that I idenify myself with (Along with Nyx but that is another story)..  Enough said! Let your imagination linger and find the rest...

       :: BEGINNING OF AN END ::    Timeline:  Past  I did not hear the ascending footsteps nor have I realized laughter coming from downstairs. I did not feel someone carefully sitting on the edge of the bed and watching me as I laid curled up upon the bed. It had taken me too long to finally cry myself to sleep the previous night and the sleep bestowed upon me was not so sound, either. Gentle fingers traced a wet lock off my forehead and it was that gentleness which called me back from my chaotic nightmares. I clinged to that touch in my mindscape and opened my swollen eyes to see him smiling at me.   He was wearing a cap... did he have to wear a cap? (I have something towards guys who make cap an inseparable part of their sense of fashion. A cap, a tight top accentuating a toned upper body and a trendy shirt the sleeves of which are tied up at the front is a sight I would turn around and look twice. If the guy is an epitome of male perfection, I would watch, save the image and replay it in my mind for the rest of the week.) Did he know me this well? Or was it only a coincidence which would certainly make things much harder for me than usual? I smiled weakly to which he said, "You look worn out."   I nodded and uttered an "I am." coarsely. He ran a thumb on my cheek while he said, "Can I do anything for you?" (This, even to this day, is the reason why Gambit has always been a harbor I chose to anchor whenever the turbulence of life overrun me. If you asked me what the initial attiude of a man towards his partner should be in a relationship -all forms of GLBT relationships included-, I would say it is this approach. There is nothing more soothing in the world for someone who possess even the slightest of stepped-forth femininity in themselves. Next time you see him/her down, instead of asking what the hell is wrong with him/her, try asking if there is anything you can do for him/her affectionately. It'll be worth the effort). I slightly shivered by this unexpected empathy and said, "Perhaps a bowl of cereal while I shower? Ask my grandmother. She will show you where it is."   He nodded and leaned over for a little morning kiss which infernoed my lips. I couldn't have time to differentiate whether it was due to the desire or the grief I possessed. He was heading for downstairs while I, lips still sizzling, headed for the bathroom. I bet it was the longest shower I ever took. I broke my shower record with a clean 2:14:34 (well yes that's hours:minutes:seconds, indeed) afterwards but let's not go in there for the minute. I did not get out until my grandmother was convinced that I had passed out.   Effect: People rushed into the bathroom screaming .:. I rushed out of the bathroom screaming.   Once outside, I could not postpone the inevitable any longer so I got dressed and went down. It seemed like the entire gang was there waiting up on me while they chatted the morning away with my Grandmother (why is it that every time you need your privacy on purpose, things get out of hands off purpose?). I thanked Gambit for the cereal which had already turned into a bowl of [insert disgusting, slimy material here] and disconnecting myself from my surroundings, munched it absently.   Allright so I had never broke up with anyone. Sue me... what was I going to say?   Gambit, I really like you so much but I believe what's happening between us should better not happen.   "Why?"   Because I'm not gay and being in such a relationship would only be channeling my actual sense of femininity into an unsatisfactory togetherness that would only torment me.   "Huh?"   Oh well...   Gambit this thing shouldn't happen because I'm a woman that is doomed to live as a male and I want to love and be loved as a woman, touch as woman, hold as a woman, dream and hope as a woman... so you see? I'm messed up.   "Err.. ok!"   Hmph..!!   These ramblings only came to an end when I realized the eerie silence around me. Blinking, I found out that I was still spooning the already empty bowl. Goddess was smirking, Gambit was grinning as he asked, "Want another one?", people were shaking heads with disbelief, I was blushing... hence we all lived happily ever after.   Later on the beach, I tried my best to keep my gaiety (pun intended) and finally as we were wrapping up to head back home in the afternoon found the chance to tell him that I needed to talk to him. He said, "Come directly to my house after dinner. We can talk all you want until we join the gang.... or perhaps you'd like to stay indoors all night?" I just said the post-conversational plans didn't matter since it was the conversation itself that was crucial. He nodded and whistled while he joined a few buddies on the way back.   I sighed wondering how I could get myself out of this and still remain friends with him when Goddess asked me if I was ready.

       :: END OF A BEGINNING ::     Timeline:  Past  [Warning: Touching material, ahead. If you are not in the mood for it, scroll down and read the  urlLink Splendidized , spiffy version]  I silently climbed the stairs so as not to wake my grandmother and father but although my footsteps were quited, my mind was racing with enhanced speed. Ears buzzing, I closed the door of my room and leaned against it as shadows caused by the light pouring in weakly through the shutters, danced around me. Instead of a hectic delighted feeling that should have carried me over the moon, I was confused and feeling abnormally ashamed of myself.   With weak steps, I dragged myself to bed and laid down gently while weak moonrays dissolved and reshaped around me. In the stillness of my room, I slowly came to realization that I was motivated by a long suppressed feminine instinct all throughout the summer. The need to be desired, cared about, looked after and on top of it all, embraced with love. An instant of utmost misery caused my brow to cease since I knew that what I could have would only be a gay relationship which would be far from quenching my thirst... a thirst belonging to a woman.   There, at the age of 17, I realized that I could never ever escape from the grasp of my true self. I could not deceive myself, nor could I deceive Gambit for that matter. I was not a male and I knew that he didn't love me as one, either. We were just going to be fooling ourselves, remain in disguise to the outer world and perhaps be happy for a while until realization stroke. I could not build a healthy relationship upon such foundations.   If I were gay, that is if I were a guy loving him as a guy and him loving me likewise, it would have been perfectly allright. But such was not the case, we knew it unconsciously and I was feeling so guilty because I was the one who blindfoldedly plotted this alltogether. Closing my eyes, I imagined him touching me, kissing me, caressing my body... a body that did not belong to me at all. I moaned softly with agony...   ... as I felt the tears tracing down my cheeks. I would not, could not, be loved the way my soul craved for. I heard an owl hoot.... moonrays shivered slightly while they accompanied the pain engulfing my curled up figure being shaken by my sobs.    Splendidized Version   :: END OF A BEGINNING ::   I silently climbed the frightfully beastly stairs so as not to wake my grandmother and papa but although my footsteps were quited, my mind was, and I don't mean to be bogus, racing with enhanced speed. How shaming! I dare say, ears buzzing, I closed the frightfully boring door of my room and leaned against it as shadows caused by the frightful light pouring in weakly through the dratted shutters, danced around me. Ugh, how uncouth! Look here, instead of a hectic delighted feeling that should have carried me over the moon, I was fabulously confused and feeling abnormally ashamed of myself. It's just too dull.   With weak steps, I dragged myself to bed and laid down gently while weak moonrays dissolved and reshaped around me . Look here, in the stillness of my room, I slowly came to realization that I was motivated by a frightfully beastly long suppressed feminine instinct all throughout the horrid summer. Look here, the simply unbearable need to be desired, cared about, looked after and divinely on top of it all, embraced with love. Golly! Horridly on the simply dashing contrary, an instant of utmost misery caused my brow to cease since I knew that what I could have would only be a frightfully boring gay relationship which would be far from quenching my thirst... a frightfully divine thirst belonging to a simply dandy woman. Good heavens!   There, at the divine age of 17, I realized that I could never ever escape from the ghastly grasp of my true self. It's so damned unfair! Dash me twice, i could not deceive myself, nor could I deceive Gambit for that matter . Darling, i was jolly well not a male and I knew that the old devil didn't love me as one, either. Twaddle! Dear me, we were just going to be fooling ourselves, remain in disguise to the simply marvellous outer world and perhaps be happy for a divine while until realization stroke, darling! Now see here - i could not build a jolly healthy relationship upon such foundations. Good heavens!   If I were gay, that is, and I don't want to be frightfully mean, if I were a shriekworthy guy loving the splendid chap as a jolly guy and him loving me likewise, it would have really been perfectly allright. Rather! I say, but such was shamingly not the simply splendid case, we knew it unconsciously and I was feeling so guilty because I was horridly the one who blindfoldedly plotted this alltogether. Ghastly, let me tell you. Utterly on the simply unbearable contrary, closing my eyes, I imagined the grand old fellow touching me, kissing me, caressing my body... a simply unbearable body that did not belong to me at all . I dare say, i moaned softly with agony...   ... as I felt the simply unbearable tears tracing down my cheeks. How shaming!Darling, i would not, could not, be loved the bloody way my soul craved for . Dash me twice, i heard an owl hoot.... moonrays shivered slightly while they accompanied the pain engulfing my curled up figure being shaken by my sobs. The dratted shame!

       :: THE INEVITABLE ::    Timeline:  Past  What can be really tiresome for a male when the female psyche is considered is its extreme tendency to take a drastically simple thing, make it as complicated as possible and, in the meantime, successfully miss the real thing/main idea.   Likewise, it hadn't dawned upon me until I was passing the wine bottle to Predator [cameo appearance ; another close friend] at the dinner table that the actual conversation between Gambit and I went :   My idiotic expression: At least you shaved.  His reasonable reply: You hate stubble, don't you?   Not only it was reasonable but it was actually very sensible and kind which should have meant something very special to me. But oh no!... Per usual, I was lost in my own maze of totally unrelated thoughts and was screwing up my system with unnecessary mental drama. Yet, this moment of enlightenment seemed a little too late since, by the look of it, he was already in the fling list of more than a few, enjoying and laughing the night away. It was just the right time for an alien invasion so that I could leave the scene without drawing attention to bury myself in shame and self-pity.   The dinner went fine and everyone stepped inside for the real party. All I did was to take some beer with me, sit on the sofa and as the lights turned darker, watch people dance and party the night away. I had already started feeling dizzy enough. Soon, Goddess accompanied me on the sofa and I rested my head on her shoulder while I told her the story. Couples disappeared and reappeared, people jigged like there was no tomorrow and as I saw sex and fun so naturally entwined that it felt more and more lonely around me. Soon it was total darkness where we were sitting which eased my uneasiness a little. There were 2 other sofas available in the room though and they were quite... efficiently occupied by the sound of it. I was going to tell Goddess how multi-functional darkness could be when I felt a head lying itself on my lap. Not only that, the owner of this head linked his fingers with mine as he started talking to us.   I felt cold sweat sneaking out from my pores as Gambit and Goddess conversed and chuckled. I on the other hand could still not comprehend the fact that it was him holding my hand, that he was determined enough to make use of this darkness surrounding us as a background for his initial step into my life in a brand new way. I could hear voices of friends approaching, talking to us, sometimes sitting nearby, at others minding their own business but all this time he did not let go of my hand once. What was I doing? My heart was beating in my ears while I responded a few remarks but was grateful for the restricted vision since I probably had a Joker smile on my face.... oh and I was semi-drunk but soon it turned out that Gambit was totally stoned...   ... and being the best friends Goddess and I were, we told everyone that we were taking him home and would be back shortly. We literally carried him along all the way and once we were in his house, I took him to the bathroom, helped him wash his face and took him back to the bedroom. He sat on the bed chuckling all the way which was getting irritating by each second but I tried not to mind it as I undressed him down to his boxers and carefully helped him lay on his bed. Exhausted, I asked, "Better now?"   ... as an answer he nodded and smirked, "Good. See you tomorrow then. Have a good rest and try not to vomit on yourself." As I turned around to leave, he jerked and grabbed my hand while uttering seriously, "I love you." That was the only time in my life I felt ground under my feet gave way (save from a serious earthquake I had to endure) but I kept my calm (Yeah.. what's new?) and softly said, "We'll talk about it first thing tomorrow. Now just rest." He fell backwards on the bed again after this extremely... "logical" answer. (If you haven't started rolling your eyes yet I guarantee you will soon if not in a few posts). I got out of his room and joined an overcurious Goddess in the living room:   Goddess raised an eyebrow.  I bit my lower lip.  Goddess raised another eyebrow.  I bit my upper lip.  No eyebrow to rise left, Goddess raised a curious hand and finally asked, "What? What?"  I said "He said he loved me."  Goddess "yay!"ed.  I said, "But that's probably because he's too drunk."  Goddess hiccupped before saying, "You seduced your way to him all through the summer and now he says he loves you and you say he's drunk?"  I tilted my head spastically.  Goddess nodded and said, "Let's go, idiot."  We went.   Back at the party, I drank another beer... then another glass of wine.... then another glass of something until I saw Gambit approaching me. Oh yeah this was it... Dreams were so real when you were drunk which lead to the drunk conclusion: I should get drunk more often. There he was sitting next to me and Goddess was with him, too. So was Predator and Bliss [another... well take a wild guess] and... Goddess was snapping before my eyes going, "Hi there sweetie. He is here again. Are you?"   I stuttered, "But he was... I mean we took...". Yet it was no dream, he was back, sitting next to me with a raised eyebrow accompanying his naughty smile. I pulled myself together, smiled back and realized the party was almost over. There weren't many people left and those present were either passed out or getting ready to head off. I saw curiosity in his eyes. I responded that look with a sincere smile hoping it came out right (something should have come out right... Right?) and meant everything was alright.   That was how we left there and as I waved them all goodbye, I saw Gambit taking a last look at me over his shoulder while Goddess took him by the arm with a huge grin.

       :: THE UNEXPECTED ::    Timeline:  Past  People can get way too creative when a party theme is concerned. Farewell to summer, hail to winter, cheers to new year, new block, new blog, new hairstyle, successful plastic surgery... Sky is the limit. I wonder when we are such inherent party animals, some deliberately ignore that optimistic part in themselves for the sake of a so called appealing "whatever" attitude towards life. Don't get me wrong. When I'm moody, I am quite intolerable myself... And I cannot say I can tolerate 24/7 hyperactive merriness, either (pun goes to all the hedonists of the globe). Mood swings are acceptable if you have a strong personality. But if you are "whatever"ing everything around yourself so as to wear that apathetic costume that you fail to consider as "cool".... all I can hope for would be that someday someone can tell you how cheesy it looks.   Anyway. There we were, so happy that the summer was finally over and that we had to bury our teenaged noses back into books we did not care about, we decided to celebrate it big time. All through the day we shopped, bought food and ingredients, spirits and junk food before we got back to the neighborhood and started cooking up while the guys scattered to return in the afternoon for the grill they were responsible for. I was among the cooks, preparing potato puree with milk and my special fried eggplants coated with tomato sauce reciped by my Grandmother.   The constant gossip need that aroused within Goddess and I was suppressed by the hoopla around us. Girls were coming and going accompanied by the occasional screams due to something overcooked, undercooked or totally gone wrong. As afternoon (finally) arrived, I was quite exhausted. Although boys dropped by now and then there was no sign of Gambit... and this simply added suspense to my weariness.   I went back home (which was only 2 minutes away anyhow), took a shower and sat on my bed clad in a bathrobe wondering (have I mentioned I love wondering at times?) how everything would go tonight. All the neighborhood would be there which meant we were to be at least 30 people at the table. And there he was going to sit close to me when I just wanted to kick him at the [insert fitting body part here] for keeping me on the edge all day. As I got dressed and went back into the bathroom for the controversial hair do, I heard footsteps on the stairs (our summer house was triplex). I was hoping to spill my worries to Goddess so I stepped out of the bathroom...   ...only to face Gambit grinning at me in a breathtaking manner. I had never seen him as someone handsome but rather someone shabby who is always with a stubble and a silent, distant manner no matter how much attention he gets. This clean shaved, perfectly dressed up (a tight white shirt enhancing his tan and build, matched by stoned jeans that fit perfectly to his footballer legs and ... everywhere else) heartthrob was someone I had never seen before. I managed a shaky smile and greeting, I think. Obviously I managed fine since he nodded back, that cunning grin never leaving his face. I returned to the bathroom, clumsily spread some hair gel into my palm and somehow slowly got it over with my ardour while my anger sneaked back in.   "How come you remained invisible all day?" I asked to which he leaned his shoulder to the door and crossed arms, "I was busy getting ready" he said laughingly, "Took sometime to bring myself back together." Obviously, he had brought himself back together quite too well but that was something I didn't dare to utter. Instead, having done with my hair, I turned around to get back to the bedroom saying, "Well at least you shaved." (Things never come out the way they should at such occasions. What's sarcasm got to do with it here, right? But that's so me, indeed.) He remained silent for a while, watching me as I strapped a string of leather around my wrist then slowly said, "You hate stubble, don't you?"   Well.. all I hated then was my entire self breaking into pieces as he unexpectedly took the reins, which I had been holding very carefully all through the summer, from my hands and hideously knocked me out (both physically and mentally) out of nowhere. So he was a diamond in the rough? Or he was a diamond who was aware of his worth but kept it hidden unless an occasion arised for him to enter his charisma to the scene? All these were racing in my mind when we heard Goddess's footsteps on the stairs. She gasped and whistled at Gambit and was playfully teasing him for which I was grateful. For it gave me the opportunity to finally breathe a little and exhale the tension stuck in my lungs.   That was how we left our house for the party... And that was just the beginning.

       :: THE UNDISCLOSED ::     Timeline:  Past  Looking back at those days, I still cannot believe how perfectly I drew Gambit into my web of the Shelob (pun goes to the Lord of the Rings' vicious spider queen that dwelled on the outskirts of Mordor, Kingdom of Darkness). I never revealed any sign of apparent interest nor have I created an occasion that would enable him or others to think he was the target of my affection. Instead, very slowly, I started activating the feminine transmission the dose of which gradually increased each time.   We were close friends for sure but soon we got closer than ever. Then again, I never made a move that would make him feel uncomfortable. No physical contact, no unusual closeness, nothing... This is why, I believe, he relaxed more and more when he was next to me and finally one day on the beach, we found ourselves having a playful fight over a ring he wears. It was way too amusing, all our friends were laughing with us but still I could feel the eyes of Gambit sparkling as if he was amused more than anyone else around us. That night, as our "gang" occupied a part of the beach per usual, he came over and laid his head on my lap though this also was never a suspicious thing for others. We all were so close and such things were very natural among us. That and the fact the we all grew up together enabled us to have such sibling-like, affectionate contacts anytime, any day.   However casual it seemed, I knew that for Gambit and I it was not casual at all. There his head on my leg, surrounded by the symphony of the crashing waves on the beach, I started singing "Unchained Melody", one of the gang's favorite themes. I could feel the words shaped themselves into an unrevealed meaning and the taste of this cannot be matched by any other.   The speed of today's relationships is sad really. No one is patient enough to slowly devour the heart melting tension in the "undisclosed" part of a budding affair. The more time passes the denser your desire and affection gets. Nevertheless, with the arrival of 21st century, love got so glued to "getting down to it" that it is rapidly consumed. Plus, when sex is such an available thing who cares about chivalry anyway? We exhaust relations so easily with our sex drive then, assuming moving from one bed to another equals dating, wonder why we don't have a satisfactory relationship. Even in a long-term relationship, if sex comes earlier than it should, it messes things up. It is an extremely delicate equilibrium. Sounds old-fashioned?   Well... what if I say this "waiting", this "mysteriously developing thing" between Gambit and I for almost a summer led to the events at the Farewell to Summer party, then?

        EPISODE II : In The Limelight    :: SUMMER NIGHTS ::     Timeline:  Past  Since my mother passed away on December 23rd, 1993, New Year Eves still give me a sense of nostalgia somewhat. Not a miserable state of the mind since pain subsides in time. That and human beings do get used to anything and everything. What remains is a minute or so of sad smile accompanied by a distant stare as the sorrowful anniversaries arrive. Then you return to the present with the speed of light and proceed.   The New Year Celebrations of 1994 was the most silent in my entire life. My father and I remained at home, watched TV, nibbled on fast food and just wanted the clock turn towards the new year as soon as possible. Our lives were waiting for us and time, when left alone, passes you by so quickly that when you realize what is going on, a considerable amount of it is left behind.   The educational system of Ponderland is somewhat eerie. If you don't have a University degree you are quite next to nothing (if you don't have many a personal bonuses, that is and High Schools are not adequate enough to educate their students so as to individually credit them for life after primary education without a higher degree) and for that reason the Ministry of Education prepares a nationwide exam for all those who wish to literally "compete against each other" so as not to... well... starve for the rest of their lives.   However, I needed to finish High School for that first. Going back to school after the Holiday, I completely focused on my studies and got back on track thus graduating with a degree. However, my goals for University were real high (I wanted to study Literature at... what can be defined as the Harvard of Ponderland). Casualty, when it comes to my personal goals, has never been what I went for so I entered the exam, knowing I barely had the chance to end up in the Uni I wanted. At least that year...   ... the exam is usually held in June and right after it, I ended up in our summer house. I truly needed some rest and had to be away from anything and everything after a marathon session of drastic events.   That summer is specifically important since it hosted the first relationship in my life. Our summer house was part of a huge block of summer houses in the outskirts of Ponderland, right by the sea. I had many seasonal friends there which, in time, turned into permanent close friendships. Goddess, as I will call her, was just one of them. On a warm summer night, adorned with a soft summer breeze on the beach, she asked me why I didn't have anyone special in my life. Up until then, love was just an emotion that awakened curiosity in me yet never practiced. I just remained silent and believe me there are not many situations I fall speechless. Although the subject just diminished as we laughed away the night, something inside me was switched on.   There is yet another thing about my personality that if I could alter, I would. However, I also accept and love myself the way I am so I love my "downs" as much as my "ups". I have no intention to be picture perfect anyway. As for this trait, it is going for what seems impossible and making it as possible as it could get. When it comes to love, it is no different. So unconsciously I searched for a target to fall in love with and make him fall in love with me. I never was and still am not into what can be called as "the scene". All my friends were straights. So this "search" was not easy... and to tell you the truth, that was why I loved it.   I don't know why I decided on Gambit. He was just a casual guy (not the Prince Charming at all) and above all, he was very straight. I knew him since I was 13 and all through those summers and recently winters, we literally grew up together. I had never felt anything special about him.   There is also something extraordinary I had to add to this story. And that is something I always possessed. First of all, let me tell you that all through these years of careful observations of the human kind and relationships, I came up with the conclusion that people initially identify each other unconsciously. When you encounter a man, let's say, you first receive the gender specific undergoing, invisible current about him. Scientifically, it is described as an outcome of hormonal secretion which turns into a emission of a transsensual scent and is received by the next party. Hence, he/she regardless of your appearance, first picks you up as a male or female, in that sense. I call it an invisible transmission between sexes. That is how Transgendered or gays can be "read" by the society, especially by females whose sixth sense are more developed than men.   I realized by then that my undergoing transmission was that of a female which had some really interesting effects on guys... especially straight guys. Since what they received from me was not the transmission of a gay, they always unconsciously approached me as a female without the fear of ending up feeling gay. I was always the one who was protected, respected and next to whom they acted more polite than usual (I wonder if this fact ever dawned upon them though I'll never know). And I used this specialty on occasion to protect myself from the outer world with a shield of male friends. Sometimes, I even used it when it was not necessary at all. Seriously, it was really so fun (if not slightly sadistic) to "activate" this ability out of nowhere towards a guy and see him end up orbiting around me where everyone else (even himself) considered us friends. Though I never used it to a degree to make him feel utterly confused about himself or approach him sexually. I had very strict limits to keep it as a safe, little game I played, indeed.   Until the "Gambit Project", that is.

       :: AFTERDEATH ::     Timeline:  Past  The silence after a funeral is the real killer. When the last one who feels for you steps out of the doorway, you are faced with the real silence as memories sneak in from the shadowy corners. There she was letting out a horrified gasp after I told her I didn't go to that Madonna concert with friends but all by myself. There she was laughing at a personal joke we shared. There she was watching Pretty Woman for the 100th time with me. There I was lying on her bony chest, listening to her soft breathing a few months ago. There she was getting ready for a night out with my father and looking breath taking...   ... I laid down on the sofa and stared at the ceiling as waves and waves of memories ebbed and flowed above me. Death forgives reasoning not. You just have to accept and get used to it the way it is. Otherwise, you find your self in a vicious cycle made up of a string of the same question : "Why?". "Why" is a bloodthirsty question, indeed. Especially when followed by "me?". Whatever happens in life, it should never be approached with this question. I may be considered a compassionate "Forgiving Humanitarian" according to my Emode results but I tried so hard to become it. To accept the stream of events in life, to take people as they are sounds like some virtue but it is actually a trait. The more you practice the more you become whatever you practice. This was the first time in my life that I realized the fact that I should wipe away each trace of tear made up of the aforementioned question.   In the years to come, this practice enabled me to successfully deal with my gender dysphoria.   As I closed my eyes so as not to see this constant motion of hovering scenes, I turned sideways and caused something extraordinary to happen. The remote control of the CD player was stuck underneath the pillows of the sofa, its edge almost visible through the edge of the pillow, and as I moved, it turned itself on...   ...only to cause the emptiness of the sitting room fill with the tunes of "Don't Cry" by Guns'N Roses:   "...Don't you cry tonight, I still love you baby,  Don't you cry tonight, There's a heaven above you baby.."   I received this little miracle with bitter gratitude... as if my mother was letting me remember the talk we had in our summer house previous summer. She took my hand in her cold palms and told me that she knew the end was near for her. As I denied my empathy and suppressed my tears clumsily so as not to break down before her she went on:   "Never cry over me for someday, somewhere we will be a big, happy family, dearest."   And I cried for the first and last time, knowing that this was the last page of another chapter in my life while the song kept on echoing in my ears until it finally faded away.

       :: STROKE OF NIGHT ::    Timeline:  Past  Almost a month after my father's by-pass, it was my mother who was hospitalized, this time, suffering from a stroke. One part of her body was completely paralyzed due to excessive bleeding in her brain yet the doctors were hopeful since they could stop the bleeding. Now all we had to do was to wait until the bloody mess dissipated. She even managed to move her paralyzed leg which, according to them, meant a greater chance for her recovery.   As these events unfolded, my father told me that the expenses we had to cover for my mother's treatment as well as his surgery way passed our limits thus they sold the apartment. However, he rented another flat in the same district so it meant no drastic alterations in our life. Still, we had to move out of the house we currently lived in immediately. He could not supervise the moving out process since his time was divided between work and hospital. It meant I was in charge of it. Could I do it by myself? Packing the entire house up? I took a deep breath and nodded. I was going to do this for my mother. She was going to be discharged from hospital in a week (or so the doctors hoped) so she had to find everything the way she had left.   Excused from school, I started packing us up. My daily schedule those days was, getting up early in the morning, packing up until noon, leaving the house for hospital, taking my turn next to my mother while my dad went to work, staying with her until afternoon when my dad returned, returning back home, keep packing up until I was literally exhausted and fell asleep at some corner of the emptying house.   The houses that are being moved out represent loneliness to me even this day. They protect you from the outside world for years and as you leave them behind, the empty walls seem emptier, the voices echoing among them enhancing their farewell. Somehow, a song always accompanied me during such stages of my life. As we were moving out of the house where my childhood had passed it was "If You Were With Me Know" by Kylie Minogue and Keith Washington. This time it was "I'll Remember" by Madonna:    "...I learned to let go, I travel in stillness  And I'll remember happiness..."    When moving out process turned into the moving in, I looked like an anorexic and swollen eyes with purple hollows under them were an inseparable part of my reflection in the mirror. Not that I was friends with mirrors, anyway so I did not mind it. Black coffee was my best friend those days and raw sausages or a bar of chocolate were my meals. I still drink my coffee black. Some things remain. (and no I prefer sausages cooked)   It was very close to the end of one week and my last visit to my mother the previous day was a memory I could never forget. I entered the cold, hospital room, crowded with occasional, worried to the bone visitors whom I knew yet did not care about, I approached the bed, took her withered hand in mine and whispered, "I am here mother." to which she half-unconsciously responded "Who are you?". It was a touching moment for all those in the room obviously thus they all fell into tears as I sighed, nodded and left the room. As I was leaving though, I re-entered the room and told her that I was leaving. This time she mumbled a barely audible "Goodbye, darling". I kissed her cheek and whispered, "I love you" to which responded with a weak smile, "I love you, too."   I entered the hospital recalling these and headed up towards her room.... only to find the room was bare empty. The human psyche reacts to such moments in two ways. You either panic with terror or disregard the scene abnormally with an even more abnormal silence. I got out of the room and headed down to the reception, asking where my mother was. The woman behind the counter said she was transferred to the 7th floor. Heading back up, I entered the narrow floor which seemed quite more dim than usual. There were a few guys sitting on the plastic chairs attached to the walls... Walking slowly, I passed them by and blinked as I realized this was the Maternal Care unit and the doors at the end of the corridor led to the room where a new life flourished into the world.   I heard my common sense trying to tell me something as I went down to the reception and sat mindlessly on a chair. I did not know what to expect. Nor could I decode the meaning of the chaos in my head. All I knew that my father or someone I knew would appear sooner or later, explaining what this was all about. I don't remember how long I stayed there. Maybe a few minutes or a few hours.... Eventually my dad entered the hospital and seemed quite surprised to see me as I called out his name.   He took me by the hand and to the cafeteria. There, he explained that my mother was in a coma and that there was a little door right next to the operation room on the 7th floor which was the Intensive Care Unit. An ironic placement representing the edge of life and death and how close they are to each other. Even if she did survive the coma, she would never be the same. For the first time in all those months, I felt my cheeks were getting wet although neither my voice faded nor my expression changed. And that night, right there as my father went on explaining, I wished for my mother's death, knowing that she could not live like a plant.   Two days later, as I was getting ready to leave the new apartment for the hospital, a wave of heat that I had never experienced before rushed over me. A close friend of mine was with me by chance, that day. I turned to him who was dressing up to leave with me and with a serious stare said, "My mother is dead." He dismissed the statement and was telling me I was being too pessimistic when the door bell rang. My uncle and his wife (from my mother's side... the parents of my cousin who caused me the hell in "When A Child Bleeds") entered followed by a couple who were close friends of my parents. My crying aunt hugged me and hugging her back, I patted her back gently, telling her it was alright.   Sometime later, her tears subsided somewhat and seeing my expressionless, calm face she asked, "Who told you?"   ...to which my friend replied, "No one did. Though, he knows now."

       :: IT WON'T RAIN ALL THE TIME ::     Timeline:  Past  As I turned 17, the raindrops of sorrow were causing a storm around my soul. Yet, on the outside, I possessed an extraordinary calmness which even surprised me. I felt like a marionette in the hands of a very mature puppet master. This was the first time I discovered that I could perfectly keep my calm during emergency situations. I let the puppet master lead me out of it... and he never fail(ed) me.   The by-pass was successful yet my father remained in the hospital for the next ten days. During those days, my mother and I got up with sunrise and head off to the hospital to take care of my father. During the nights, other family members or my dad's close friends insisted to stay with him. That and my mother was going through the worst stage of cancer so she needed rest. Even then, her bravery and her willpower surprised me. She bought herself a wig and although she could only stand still or walk around with the help of crutches, she ignored her physical condition to aid her husband. Watching her dealing with everything with a power beyond imagination was awe inspiring. Today, I assume that the phenomenal endurance I have against my "bad luck" is inherited genetically from her.   My father's recovery astonished even the hospital staff. He was up and around, leaving the hospital just after 11 days (You might have seen by now that I rarely mentioned my dad up until now. Fingers crossed, the why of it will be revealed in details soon).   Thus, I thought the heavy rain was slowing to a dribble. Apart from the huge trace on his chest, my dad seemed just as he was before and he even convinced me to go back to school (My teachers were so tolerant as to the turmoils of my life that even today, I remember their understanding with gratitude. They did everything to support me. Even sent exams with friends to our apartment so that I didn't fail my last semester. I was already going to graduate in the top 5 before everything started).   One evening, I came back from school only to find out that the house was a bit... more crowded than usual. One of my mother's childhood friends (who had gone to chemotherapy with her that day) opened the door but oddly left it ajar and wanted me buy some aspirin for her. I wanted to leave my books and sports bag but she just took them for me and hurried me up.   Confused, I returned home with the aspirin and it was obvious that something was just not right. My father and mother was locked in the bathroom and remained there a little too long. As the minutes passed me by, my worry started to overtake but, per usual, I remained as calm as possible. Finally, they got out of the bathroom and I saw my dad literally carrying my half unconscious mother to their bed. They explained that after the session, my mom raised her hand to her forehead, mumbled "My head..." and collapsed. My knees getting weaker with each heartbeat, I approached her and saw the transfixed expression on her face.   ... she was half paralyzed.

      :: MUSINGS ::   * Looking by far, I realized that if I ever decide to publish my autobiography, I should cut the childhood part real short. No sexual harassment, no incest that messes my psyche up thus leaving me gender weirdphoric and above all no gay sex! It won't sell. I should make up a few raunchy scenes.    (...and here he was again. I knew that he was following me all the way back from school. I was shivering like a leaf when he grabbed my arm without a word and dragged me to a side street. His big, calloused hands were trying to unbutton my jeans as I ripped open his shirt. My lips drew the symbol of eternity on his nipples as I caressed his bulging biceps. Moving down, I continued my journey on his muscular chest. He spasmed with pleasure and my tongue got stuck in his abdominals...)    [Mental note: What the?]   *Have yet another serious concern. This time about whether it was a wise decision to start a blog when I am HTML disabled. Furthermore, somewhere along the line, this thing should start archiving my entries. However, there's just no sign of older entries disappearing as of yet. (Panic!) I'll have a website that scrolls down to eternity! (Count to 10!)  *Looking at a few other diaries, I feel so ashamed. Everyone seem so globally aware and responsible. Saddam Hussein's capture is the talk of the day but here I am trying to plot my way into my present in a horribly prolonged sense.   *If that wasn't enough (very impressed by a comment in Bridget's Diary) I decided that not reading the original book before seeing a movie adaptation is a sin. Thus, I am trying to finish Return of the King day in day out. Last night, I thought I saw a hobbit peeking at me as I took a shower. Sad, really.   [Unrelated thought: I remember developing Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia* temporarily after trying to memorize Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious from Mary Poppins.]   *Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words.

       :: SURVIVOR ::     Timeline:  Past  (Have serious concerns whether this melodramatic life story will reach present before New Year or not. Maybe I shouldn't have journeyed that back towards my fetus memories.)   As my 16th birthday was approaching, we had another family crisis. Cancer recaptured my mother and my father's heart was giving out signs of another possible heart attack. Standing amidst these, I had to be much stronger than I ever could be. Although the boyish charm worked relatively well, my voice remained that of a girl. I was trying my best to deliberately talk as deep as possible yet my mother was occasionally thinking that I was using hormones secretly (in my dreams, thank you). I mean I am not talking about a Michael Jackson trip here. I really had the voice of a girl. When people who didn't know me called and it was I who answered it, the "get backs" to my parents were "Yeah we called home and talked to your daughter" which seriously didn't help my disguise at all. The dilemma followed me wherever I went, indeed. As long as I didn't talk I did well with all the shabby clothes and facial hair. But when I opened my mouth it was a shock for the other party who got used to my voice only after some time. Furthermore, my hands and feet remained as small as a female as well as my overall bone structure remained dangerously androgynous. I didn't have breasts and all but my body and face was so structurally in between that the disguise needed so much work. I didn't shave up until these days and tried to looked like Jewish youngsters. Add the huge glasses and the clothing that didn't fit right, I looked extremely ugly.   Yes ugly, indeed. There is just no other word to describe how I looked those days (Keep in mind that I was an adolescent who was still going through the growing pains and hormonal ups and downs of puberty. Naturally, teenagers my age were so outlook oriented and I had the same emotions and concerns about acceptability, first love, sex, acne and whatsoever as any of them but could never go through them properly). I remember one specific event when I bought flowers for my mother (this was after we moved out to this new flat of mom's dreams and during her radiotherapy days) on my way back home from school. As I was walking past a group of teenagers my age one of them whispered to his buddy, soft enough not to draw attention, high enough for me to hear, "Eww he's uuugglllliiieeee".   Alright at least I wasn't called a "sissy" but this was the next worse thing to be called (after "eww he's spookkiieee"). I remember feeling so numb that I came home, gave the flowers to my mom, barely remembered her gratitude before I locked myself in my bedroom. I think I sat on my bed thinking repeating something like "There'll be one day when all the world will admire me for my beauty and talent. I swear you'll be sorry for what you said!" a zillion times until I was called for dinner.   My mother was shrinking before our eyes, her hair completely gone and suffering from great physical pain but she still tried her best to keep her high spirits. I should admit that my mother and I were really close. We used to laugh a lot together and she had this idea that we were like sister and brother instead of mother and son. (Later, I realized it wasn't "us specific" for every mother fooled herself likewise occasionally.) Actually we were so, in more than a few ways... if she wasn't desperately ignoring what I really was, we could even be closer.   My life was studded with chemotherapy and radiotherapy sessions, exams as I was soon to graduate high school and paradoxical mood swings that got worse daily. Still, I was doing my best to keep them all to myself until one day the winter sun hid behind a cloud leaving everything cold & grey...   ... My father was hospitalized after a heart stroke and had to undergo by-pass as soon as possible.

       :: THE DISGUISE ::    Timeline:  Past  I was 12 when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. However, it was during the early stages of the cancerous tissues, thus, she had over 100% chance of survival. Still, this was yet another traumatic event for an early teenager who was constantly exposed to the fear of loosing the leading people in her life story. Interesting though, I did not turn into a paranoid freak but instead turned into something much worse : A selfless youngster. I learned to perfectly disguise my gender dysphoria for what my parents needed was not a troubled but an examplary child. Hence, I focused on my already successful classes and created an image that I was there for them but was doing just great myself, either. There was nothing to worry. All they should care about was their own well-being.   Through those years, I had great control over myself. Unconsciously, I examined everyone around me and eventually developed a "boyish charm" which was both acceptable by the society and myself (ie. I didn't have to act like a studly hormone bomb and could still live belittle-free.). Only during those lonely moments, I faced my own self. On the outside, I was the child everyone wanted. My teachers were so proud of my great success at school. So were my parents...   ...also through these years a phenomenal talent I had was discovered.   My voice!   My music teacher made me a part of the chorus but not satisfied with it all, I auditioned for the school band and ended up as the lead singer. What astonished people about me was the fact that I was a true soprano although I was 15. Surely by that time, all the boys were undergoing the range drop testosterone was causing them whereas I was still as perfectly singing "Listen To Your Heart" as Marie Fredriksson. Alongside my studies the band and chorus rehearsals were taking up most of the time and I was approaching the conclusion of "I belonged to the stage" with the speed of sound.   In the meantime, my family was at its best financially. Money was pouring in and soon they were ready to cross that line between middle and upper classes. We had two apartments that belonged to us, thanks to my dad's grandparents. My mother was forcing my dad to sell them and include some of the money in our bank account to buy a house at the Santa Barbara of Ponderland. My grandmother was quite sad to hear those plans since one of those flats to be sold was the one she used to live in. My mother was quite a fighter, though. My lovely Grandmother stood no chance across such a determined woman who could fight away a life-sipping illness like cancer so easily.   Thus, as I was ending up 2nd at a song contest which included high school bands nationwide, we were getting ready to leave the flat we lived in for 10 years behind.

       :: LONELY AS A STAR ::     Timeline:  Past  As I turned 6, my intellect seemed to surpass my age. My Grandmother who was the second most important figure in my life, found out one day that I was sitting by myself turning the pages of the newspaper. She smiled and thought I was looking at the photos of the articles which soon turned out to be a great mistake on her part. Half an hour later, she returned and found me in the same position thus, curiously asked what I was doing. Obviously, I was reading the thing, what else?   Not believing, she called for my mother and together they looked at me shocked as I shrugged at their demand and started reading an article out loud to them. It was a moment of true disbelief for certain. There was this youngling not knowing how to read a day ago and was doing so the next. From that point on, I started reading whatever came my way as well as following my daily TV schedule made up of cartoons. That early step towards literacy should have turned me into a proud walking library in time yet, just like my current self, I only read what I enjoyed... and I never enjoyed social sciences save from Psychology. I despise Philosophy, am apathetic towards Sociology, find History too boring, Economics too statistical, Politics too tactical, Archeology too archaic, Architecture too visual, and going on listing the rest too unnecessary.   What awed me was the occult, the unknown and the wonders of human psyche. For these, I needed a greater imagination. Hence literature seemed like a field I could try.   As I was ready to start Primary School, my parents were ready to take the next big step in their lives. They were investing in the ready-to-wear sector, rent a building, turned it into a workshop, bought various sewing machines and started the business at a time when textile held great opportunities in Ponderland. However, this meant yet another maturity level for me since this time I was faced with the matter of taking care of myself. At 7, I was used to phone calls and notes from my parents like "milk & cake in the fridge, heat the blabla for dinner, homework to be done before we arrive...". I did them all perfectly...   ...and soon got used to the do-it-yourself theme of my life. Ironic enough, I was desperately in need of empathy and sympathy as a gender dysphoric child from my parents. I knew subconsciously that "something" was wrong with me but couldn't figure out what it was. I had friends at school but the way people looked at me was different. And sometimes I was called a "sissy" by the elder children on our block as I passed them by on my way back from school. I was only 8 or 9, then. I remember feeling so hurt from being called as such but I did not know why they were belittling me likewise.   What I was doing wrong, I knew not. What the problem was with me, I comprehended not. I was just a little child who needed some affection yet all I had was silence, loneliness and the sense of being "different" in a degrading way.   And just as I reached my early teens, my father had his first heart attack. Being only 11, I was now facing the fact that life was not all about endurance. He survived the attack yet the seed of fear was buried in my soul already.   I think I was a girl but I couldn't talk about it to anyone. If my father heard about it, he might have had another stroke and died... and God forbid if my mother heard about it. She would probably turn back to those violent days and beat me to death...  Soon, it turned my fear was nonsense for she could never turn back to those days.   ... she had cancer.

       :: EMPATHIC RECOGNITION ::    Timeline:  Past  It would be quite erratic to think that I was the victim of constant violence as a child for violence halted as abruptly as it started and I barely remember those moments as a whole anyway. However, the traumatic effect of those earliest days of childhood reformed themselves as I developed a sense of extreme caution when it comes to righteousness in my personality as I grew up. Even today, I react quite impulsive during those very rare occasions when someone tries to blame me for something I am not responsible for or judge me wrong. Perhaps even the creation of this blog can be linked to those days and might be seen as an extension of the necessity to be understood thoroughly.   I never blamed my mother for having an overedgy personality. She was the last child of a family of six made up of four siblings and parents. My grandmother was a pathetic person who was so focused on her beauty (she was extremely beautiful, by the by) and her husband. Thus, she gave birth to my mother and cared not about her since she was way too busy quarreling with my Grandfather who, she somehow made herself believe, betrayed her constantly. My mother grew up in an environment where tension between parents were always the subject of the day. My Grandfather being a Music teacher, they were from a rather under average class financially, traveling from one place to another constantly until they ended up in Ponderland where my Grandfather decided to settle for the rest of their lives (My Grandparents were living one street away from where we lived). In time, my mother also turned into a very beautiful girl, obviously inheriting the best genes of her parents. She and my father met at a social organization where they both practiced folkloric dances. My father was the typical popular guy in a conventional society. Very handsome (I will never remain humble when it comes to my parents' physical attributes. They were both universally beautiful people) and mature as well as being a perfectly educated Don Juan.   Thus, they got married after his compulsory military service although my father admits that it was not love but compassion which made him tie the knot with my mother. He knew that this beautiful girl was living in an environment woven with a nightmare that she did not deserve and well... which guy wouldn't like to be the man in shining armor of a damsel in distress? Pathetically chivalrous but so unfortunately true that their marriage was based upon these values and I believe the reason why my father never betrayed my mother was simply because she was so gorgeously feminine as well as witty. A tamed femme fatale perhaps. Then again, they both knew that love was not present in between. Passion and mutual support, perhaps. Yet not love...   ...and my mother was in need of love desperately.   Thus, I assume she believed (like countless women foolishly believed) that if she couldn't be loved the way she wanted by the man she loved, she could create an object of love whom she would love and be loved by unconditionally. Hence, she wanted to fall pregnant to which my father did not object (Today, he says he was rather apathetic on the matter since he always believed that a child would not solve their untold problems). After a few miscarriages, my mother finally fell pregnant with my brother and gave birth to him two years prior to my delivery. However, my brother did not even last a month which tore my parents apart, leaving a wound in their souls that would not heal entirely. I guess my mother's pain turned into a rather unrealistic and unhealthy stubbornness towards having a child soon afterwards. Before me, she miscarried another baby during an accident after which the doctors seriously warned her that it would be extremely dangerous for her to fall pregnant again.   My father was quite alright with it. For him it was her well being that mattered (and the previous apathy I mentioned) however it didn't stop my mother at all who fell pregnant with me and had an extremely dangerous pregnancy which was sabotaged more than once by her metabolism and the baby in despair within her womb. She was so senselessly obsessive that she even said yes to lying back motionless for the 6 months of 7 months she carried me.   Being this obsessive towards me, she even stood between the father and the baby and became the one and only personality in my life. Subconsciously I was hers....   ...and this obsession made her deaf if not blind towards my gender dysphoria.

       :: WHEN A CHILD BLEEDS ::     Timeline:  Past  It is interesting how remembrance may play possum when it comes to one's earliest memories. You rarely remember a stream of events but instead recall captions of your early childhood. Mostly one has photographs of a moment stored in their psyche. When it comes to emotions though, it is much easier. You can instantly categorize and say that you have a "happy/sad/neutral/normal/painful/merry/whatever" childhood.   Mine was rather ironic in that sense.   The earliest memory that I possess regarding my childhood is me polishing my nails. For some reason, it was not opposed by my parents who probably thought that it was a childish caprice on my part. Yet, I somehow remember that my father took me out while I still had that polish on my tiny nails and visiting the studio of his actor friend who was really famous in Ponderland during 70s. The caption I have from that visit is me sitting on my dad's lap and the guy telling me something about my nails. I really can't make out what is it, though.   Another moment of note was told me years later by my dad. It was after my family's receiving a dinner invitation to a Professor's house. During that dinner, my father says, there was a moment when I stood by the record player which was caught by the Professor who told my parents that I should immediately be genetically/gynecologically tested for my future well-being. This, though, was opposed harshly by my mother...   ..my mother..   ..who had been the leading figure in my life until her death in 1993. I was born into a middle class family who was living in an apartment in one of the most popular districts of the city. My uncle (from my mother's side) and his family was also living in the same apartment and it soon seemed that my cousin truly despised my being with all his might. Before my birth, my mother was the one looking after him and he loved her even more than he loved his own mother. They really developed a strong bond until I was delivered to their cozy world, thus, stealing the attention that he was so used to. As an adult, I can understand these feelings belonging to a child. However, I was as naive as I could get as a child myself, totally unaware of the fact that I was a threat to this relation. Thus, I constantly found myself being accused of the the mess that he kept causing. The slightest of naughtiness my cousin created was reflected to me and ended up as my being the one who had the fault (he was 5 years older than myself hence could plot his way to these scenes much easily). No matter how innocently I begged for mercy, cried my eyes out stuttering I did nothing, I was beaten to death. My screams (as my Grandmother later told me) could be heard from 2 blocks away and mostly I had to be rescued by someone or another from those moments of torture. Once I was way too close to death that if my aunt did not save me by sheer chance (ie. passing by the street and hearing my cries tearing the street apart), I would have lived only 3 painful years in this world and freed my angel soul.   The beatings ended abruptly one day when my mother, extremely guilty seeming, told me that she was so sorry for all that she had done. There it was, a 33 years old woman, apologizing from a 4 years old kid. This must have been the first instant in my life when I realized that I had to grow up quite quicker than I should. Although the physical violence in my childhood ceased, I remember giving a few extremely intelligent replies to my mother referring to the pain she had caused me occasionally, hence, nailing her to her place.   She even had to throw a china on the ground, shattering it into countless pieces one day so as to avoid hitting me because of one of those witty replies belonging to a child whose justness even she could not deny.

          PROLOGUE    THE EYES OF AURA MARS        EPISODE I : Early Years      :: A PREMATURE BEGINNING ::     Timeline:  Past  To tell you the truth, up until the point of birth, I actually tried a few times to suicide as soon as I realized that I got transferred to the wrong womb. The officials at "Neverland Transport" hadn't quite liked me, I knew that much, but this was taking the sarcasm a bit too far. Not only this cord was getting more painful by day but also there was something sticking out from my crotch that shouldn't be there. I was a female and they were going to stuck me in a male body!   As soon as I realized this mistake, I plotted my revenge as well as my suicide. Balling my hands into fists, I tried my first attempt of ending this nonsense during the woman's 5th month into pregnancy. I was very close to success, too.. But the woman was so unbelievably determined that as soon as I kicked open the entry into the womb, she got herself stitched! No kidding! I saw fingertips moving faster than a speeding bullet while they "patchworked" her insides to prevent me from getting out.   Thus, I found myself literally imprisoned and, day after day, loosing my hopes to return where I come from. Every second was bringing me closer to a life where I was to live somebody else's life instead of the one I chose among thousands in the Neverland. Darn they had some offerings for me! Said I had nice karma points thus I could choose a life falling into the Movie Star/High Society Trash category.   A gold tooth sparkled as I grinned and skipped myself merrily towards the station. But this... was highly unexpected. Could it be the guy who was sitting next to me on the plane's doing? I barely remember to leave my seat to take a leak and there were screams coming from the outside saying something about Interdimensional terrorists. Oh well... Lights went off, the floor shook, I think I fell and hit my forehead to something thus passed out.   And here I was... Approaching to somebody else's life. They were months of despair, indeed. Growing sadness until I realized that there just could be one more way out of this. If I could not get out then I could get myself killed within! And the easiest way was to do it was to blood-fill the womb. But how??? The walls of the womb were way too thick for me to tear or damage. Rising my head, I realized that I could try pulling the cable down. Thus on the 25th of November, around 23:46, I cord-attacked the womb thus caused blood pour in.   Oh what a blissful moment that was. I closed my eyes, smiled and waited patiently for the blood to reach above my nostrils....   ....Until blinding light obscured my vision. I felt hands grabbing my still weak baby body while my memory escaping me fast. I gasped as the first molecule of oxygen sneaking into my lungs and screamed...   ... thus on 26th of November at 00:05, I drastically failed at the first struggle against my Fate.

       :: THE POWER OF POVERTY ::   Timeline:  Past vs Present   As shall be revealed soon (if you haven't captured it by now, that is) all throughout my adolescence, up until the drastic events followed one after another in 1999, I had lead a rich life financially. Then again, this shouldn't mean that I swam in a pool of dollars every morning and grew up to become a "$ or nothing" personality. My parents, no matter how wealthy they were, always drew the line (a little too keenly) when it came to fulfilling my wishes generously. I learned that money didn't mean that I could always get whatever I wanted from them so I am not a "Clueless" girl by any means. I would have loved to become one, mind you. Probably, life would have been much easier if I could create a chaos out of a broken nail and all that mattered was how to get the hottie next door. Maturity brings along thinking... and that is an itchy matter. All these ethically high values start filling your life and you find yourself turning into either an understanding creature or an intellectual being both of which sound valuable but screws up the fun.   5 years ago, I would have told you that I was on my way towards my dreams. I was surrounded by countless friends, was doing what I always believed that I had been created for; ie. singing, leading an oversocial life made up of all these colorful people, clubbing till I dropped and waking up at all these places all over, studying at the best university of this country, was a very successful student even in that hectic current of my daily life which surprised the seniors of my department who were planning my schedule leading towards assistantship in my Sophomore year. All these may sound too unreal or maybe draws a smart alec picture of me but who cares? Not me, really...   ...because no matter how much I was leading the life I always wanted to lead, I was not happy. The inherent melancholy and/or sadness of gender dysphoria never drops off one's neck. It is there... It hides itself now and then and there are surely times when one feels that things could never get better than this. One may even laugh a real laughter now and then or feel a true contentment out of some success.. But sooner or later comes the night, the silence when one cannot escape the reality and the uproar of shadows rushing forth from corners to remind one that this is NOT their lives but somebody else's. This form, this personality, these dreams, this success, this contenment, these spotlights (if there are any) and unfortunately these friends and this family do NOT belong to them but this somebody else who reigns on their throne.   I will not stand up and say that everything I possessed back then was fake. They certainly weren't because a part of me was still involved in whatever I achieved. Nevertheless whatever I achieved went to this person within whose identity and form I was trapped. He was given credit for everything I founded. This may sound as a multiple personality disorder for some but this is the only way I can create a thorough image of my past verity. This is the purest form of acting... and the purest form of pain due to this reason.   How long can one "act out" a life?   I couldn't for long and gave up at 22. Still, I will cast that aside because it is another story altogether. Looking back at those days I see myself at the center of a strong current which carried me along towards lands I had never seen before. This certainly gave me pleasure. But only NOW I realize that it was all because I never had problems having enough money in my pocket to pursue this sparkling sociality. It was my intellect who enabled me to register at Bayside University but it was money that made me pay the tuition fees and stay there. It was my talent which enabled me to be a part of a successful band but it was money that made me live out a life apart from my family and with the band members. It was my personality which enabled me to have a social life and be surrounded by amazing people but it was money that made me buy the preppy clothes, pay at the entrance to clubs, theatres, raves, bars and all those things you get (drink, food, whatever) once inside.   It all went unbelievably well until one morning, I opened my eyes and found myself on a torn mattress, under a stained blanked, staring at peeled-off walls, looking at worn jeans and an old, faded jumper that I had to wear yet again that day and got up to check every pocket available for a single coin that will buy me a doughnut for lunch. It was then that I saw that I was now in the real world... that the dream was over and although I could now see my real reflection in the mirror, I was faced with things I had never been faced with... some of those things included hunger, cold, fear, loss and a deprivation that barred every aspect of life imaginable.   It is during such times that all those friends left my side one by one not because of the consequences of my choices but simply because I could not keep up with their pace any longer. I was feeling as if all I ever had were being sifted through a metaphorical sieve and eventually I was left with only a few. It is during such times that I finally start getting to know my father and grandmother, enduring all that we lacked with them and realized that all the real bonds of life are actually formed by suffering together, facing the pain together and not by laughing life out together. It is during such times with those friends who were unique and strong enough to resist the sifting process and sticked by my side showering me with their understanding and love that I formed my most precious relationships. When I was captured in hopelessness they welcomed me into their hopes. When I was shivering in cold, they bought me clothes to resist the winter. When I lacked courage and was wounded by all the catastrophe that poured in endlessly, they provided me with a tranquil sanctuary to heal up, rest and take a step out of the chaos temporarily.   ... and only through poverty, I am proud to say today, I learn that all the priceless gifts of life are hidden in the simplest of things.

       :: INSIDE OUT ::   Timeline:  Present   I have been feeling exhaustingly sick these last two days.. I woke up suddenly early Monday morning and could barely have time to make it to the bathroom to throw my dinner up. It was nearing 5 am, all dark and nothing was audible apart from my uncle's snoring (storming). I felt thankful for it since I didn't want to wake anyone up so I sat there on the ground, randomly effected by a reflexive cramp which caused me to double over in pain and retch. Having left anything but bile to deliver into the toilet, I leaned my forehead on the edge of the bath tub and waited for the palpitations to subside...   ...it was then I realized that I was actually practicing my future. In that lovely "Playground" I have recently described, such would be the case if something like this happened in a long distant years ahead. A lonely suffering as it always has been. Still, I was not that scared child who was so afraid of vomiting any longer. I got up feeling dizzy and weary, flushed the mess, washed my face and went back to the Cocoon feeling as if my stomach was literally replaced with a rock. It was obvious that I was suffering from food poisoning. Resting my back on the pillows, I sat there in the silence, hugged my toy dog Johnny who has been my inseparable friend since I was 1 and whispered to him softly, "Well Johnny... Here we go again." He looked up at me with that compassionate smile of his as always and remained silent (as always). Then again (his) silent understanding was all I asked for.   That and the embrace of music... Wearing the headphones of my walkman, I turned the radio on... only to be welcomed by the entrancing tunes of Sarah McLachlan decipher all that I go through into notes:   "... Passion chokes the flower 'til she cries no more...  Possessing all the beauty, hungry still for more...  Heaven holds a sense of wonder  and I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides..   In this white wave  I am sinking in this silence...  In this white wave,  In this silence I believe..."   So I believed and so I sat there embracing my companion until the first shrinking violet of the day sneaked into my Cocoon as if apologizing for all the darkness I have had to go through.

       :: TRAINSPOTTING - Part Two ::   Timeline:  Past (Fall of 1995)   I was ready! More ready than anyone could be for that ultimate challenge in front of everyone who would also be ready to shun my self-esteem (which many considered as arrogance). Looking back at those days now, I can clearly see that it was probably another way of hiding my actual lack of self-love by overemphasizing my talent. For all my life, wherever I went, my voice stood up in the crowds and singing was one channel for me that led to acceptance by others. .. and it is this degree of acceptance which plays a crucial role in adolescence, indeed. Since I never developed a low voice and was so very happy for it, since music was an inseparable part of my life, it was inevitable that I would learn to use this unique attribute as a piece of instrument. I did, indeed... and it rarely failed me in awing others which let me have the aforementioned acceptance as I grew up instead of the "freak of nature" label.   I was not nicknamed "The Voice" for nothing, after all.   Nevertheless, none of these people was aware of these so I had my inner fun while I entered the Piano room all smiles and dropped my bag in a corner. Sprinter and other tenors welcomed me and it was then I realized I had a merry sparkle around me... While the tape was being ready for the rehearsal, I kept playing with the lyrics sheet while I tried to get to know the tenors. Aside from Sprinter we had Ode who really had a touching voice and is nicknamed likewise... and Mohican for certain.. How could that long, dark hair and constant defiance of his be forgotten? (I truly dislike long hair at a guy as a side note).. Who else was there? Oh yes Glasses... He was a short guy who usually suffered from detonation but well... We were crowded, indeed and in that cacophony who gave a second thought?   When Avarel arrived and the warm up was done, he examined a pile of sheets indifferently and came up with a "What were we to do today?" Thinking he darn knew what was in line and was just faking this attitude deliberately, I sighed slightly and craved for shoving that apathy in his face as soon as possible. A baritone raised his voice going, "Long Train Running!" and Avarel nodded as if he'd just remembered... "So.." he began turning to me "Shall we?" He pointed everyone to take their seats and pointed with a grin at the podium the piano was upon.   "Here we go" I thought "Nail it or quit!"... Like I had another choice but the former, anyway... When the first notes from the guitar filled the room, I hopped on the podium gingerly and started singing in a clear alto. I have this ability to switch singing from range to range (Charon used to say I'm the only one she knew who could duet with herself).. If I want I can focus on singing as a tenor (which sounds a little artificial but helps a lot when the notes get deeper) or as an alto, a mezzo-soprano (my real range) or soprano (Come Mariah may!). When the last notes faded, a loud cheer and applause roared before me and I found out with relief that "The Voice" did her job well....   ...and that I was welcomed by this group of people.   However, Avarel was not convinced, "Well..." he said as he took his bench behind the piano "..it's easy to sing alongside the tape. Let's see how well you'll do by yourself!"... I was feeding on his continuous challenge, indeed but I wonder if he was aware of this fact. The more he challenged me the fuller I got and the more he was bound to loose this nonsense. So he played and I accompanied gladly...   ...when it was over, everyone was certain that I was the lead of this song. Avarel raised his head and nodded contently... and this was how he raised the white flag....   And how my trainspotting came to a victorious end.

       :: SNOW MUSE ::   Timeline:  Present   These two days have been magnificent especially due to the heavy snowfall and accompanying wind. It also meant we would end up suffering from power cuts, indiscribibly messed up traffic jams and even probable water cuts. Yesterday morning, I was woken up by the wind beating against my window, telling me to hurry up and make use of this setting even if I was in the heart of the city. Rubbing my sleepy eyes, I looked outside my window only to be welcomed by the snowflakes pacelessly hurled by the strong breathing of  urlLink Boreas . The sough in the air was so dominant that although I was looking at this scenery from within the warmth emitted from the radiator, it caused a shiver run up and down my spine while my father knocked on the door to tell me that the tea was ready if I wanted to have a breakfast with him. Wrapping the shawl that my best friend had given me as a birthday present last year around my shoulders, I hurried towards the chilly dining room. Here, on a really old sofa that had given up on its owners ages ago although the owners of it persisted to keep it, slept my father and although he always says he never minds the cold and loves to sleep in a cold environment rather than hot, I couldn't help but wonder how he didn't catch pneumonia. This was yet another thing the two of us had to endure all throughout these years.   "You look tired, beautiful" My father said as he passed me the cholestrol-free margarine, "Had a rough night?" I responded with a nod before I spread some butter on a slice of bread before I slowly chewed on my morsel, "I had a few nightmares, dad. You know they come and go."   A worried line appeared between his brows, "I thought they were gone for good but I am guessing you wouldn't give them a second thought when it's just your weather out there." He winked as he sipped his tea.   "Uh-hm.." I said while I nibbled on a tomato slice, "..I believe it will be an amazing day..." then I turned back at him empathatically, "At least for some of us... Do you need to get too far away from around here? It seems the storm will worsen and so will the traffic."   He waved my concern away and I needed not to pursue the conversation. Later in the day the powers went as expected and the whole city suffered from a great white burden. We kept hearing that people got stuck in the traffic and could not return their home and many people labelled yesterday as the most shameful day in Ponderland's recent past. This was the city where the heart of an enitre nation beat, where history and modernity have met in a lovers embrace over centuries and finally screwed their relationship up thanks to the civic government (but what's new?).   Around 5 pm, I started waiting up on my dad buried in my beret, scarf, my trendy jacket (oh it may be freezing cold, I may be broke to the bone but when it comes to the looks no one can stop me! I inherited my mother's great talent of putting all these cheesy/cheap/second hand things together and end up looking well done when finance is down the hill. When its back on track, though... oh let's not go in there, shall we?), my deep red gloves alongside my snowflaked everwhere else and was startled when I saw this guy who was carrying two huge bags at each hand (poor guy) trying not to loose balance on the snow clad streets of Ponderland while his approaching shadow turned into....   ...my father! (poor me).   "Dad!" I cried as my breath smoked out of my lips, "What's this?" I leaned over to help him with the bags as he sneezed "We needed new bath robes." I blinked and took one, not believing what I hear, "We did indeed but don't you think it's a little...not-so witty decision to buy them today?" We sat off and he sneezed again before he replied, "Never postpone today's deed till tomorrow, beautiful."   "Even if the weather is a turmoil and there is great possibility that some wind can blow me off my feet and I am prone to break a bone, injure a limb, hit my forehead to a car's bumper, cause an internal bleeding, be faced with death while I try to carry a humongous bag?"   He passed the bag over to his other hand and replied, "You need cigarette for the night?" I paused slightly, was left behind a little before running after him and musing "I think I'm like father like daughter" as opposed to his regular hit back about me being "like mother like daughter".   Today is different, though. The wind slowed its pace and the snowflakes dance in the air in a ballet that only nature can compose. The trees look as if they are dressed their naked trunks and brenches up in a fitting pure white attire and reach out towards the skies as extras in this great act. The naughty concrete jungle of the city has surrendered and let itself be clothed in matching suits so that man-made is covered to give way to the elegance of  urlLink Phusis 's winter dance.   ...a dance that is enhanced by a joyous symphony; the chiming laughter of children playing on the streets.

       :: THIS OUGHT TO BE MY PLAYGROUND ::   Timeline:  Present   There are times when I sit down, close my eyes and wonder if this is truly what it is meant to be for me. When you live your life in a chaotic environment, you realize the importance of the concept "home" in your daily lives. Whatever negativity you may encounter in your daily lives, even the after effects of the trashiest occasions do slip away from your soul if you have a place of your own that you can lock against the turbulents of life and shelter yourself in its silence.   If I were to compose my current reality all over, I would picture myself in a studio-like, single-roomed apartment, overlooking the winking lights of the city and furnitured rather cozily; minimalistic yet modern. I always liked the blue and cream/white combination for some reason so the dominating colors would be likewise. I'd probably have red in the form of lava lamp and there would be nothing more than a few spotlights for the illumination. I'd definitely have a hairy rug (very 70s style that will take me back to the age of Flower Children) somewhere amidst the room with matching pillows scattered upon it... perfect to curl up with a book as the sweet smell from the incense filled the air. There would be various candles for sure... many of them... And I would arrive from work into this soothing scene, head off into the kitchen, cook me a made-up meal (I don't know how I gained the ability to instantly make up recipes with the ingredients currently available... what is even more surprising is the fact that they turn up something consumable... delicious, even), get myself a glass of wine and let someone like Nora Jones accompany me....   ... Sounds like a dream to get to... but I will!   if not today...   if not tomorrow...  someday, I will. 	   I owe this to myself.   If you have a home that can host tranquility for you, cherish it. One of the greatest lessons that these last 5 years of my life have taught me is that the following is a priceless gift one may ever have:    A space that can be home sweet home.

       :: TRAINSPOTTING - Part One ::   Timeline:  Past (Fall of 1995)   As I entered the Piano Room on the aforementioned date/time, it was infested with many (used to refer at the uncountability of individuals) people who seemed so enthusiastic to start singing right away (not!). All around me were people drowned in goofy humor centered around the many ways of nailing a concert of which I had no idea about since it had taken place last year. Don't get me wrong, I'm not overly judgmental when it comes to stepping in a brand new setting. Then again, when the degree of your invisibility feels to high to bear, there is nothing left for you to do but to sit back and watch people.... in a not so neutral level. It was obvious that I was the only new arrival for the day (the Auditions lasted until Friday so perhaps there would be more newcomers in the coming days) and the only thing I could expect from this crowd was a few interested stares that didn't remain fixed on me more than a second before they turned away to meet that of an acquaintance. So I waited silently for the Avarel guy to appear in some corner since I heard that he was the one responsible for this ensemble.   Finally he appeared down the stairs and entered the room with that pesky smile on his face accompanying his slouchy walk. He was simply irritating, if you know what I mean. The first impression we had of each other was obvious and I wasn't fool enough to think it was going to be easy for me to sing when I had a thing against the one who would train us. He stood next to the bench (yes a bench, indeed) behind the piano and raised his voice to gain some attention. "Hey hey!! Silence please, everyone? Thank you... first of all, it's great to be among you again. I see all the old faces." [insert single claps, yeahs and yays from a huge crowd of guys in a corner here] "Yeah yeah nice to see you, too guys! And a few new faces..." he turned to nod at me and seeing all the attention turning at me with the speed of light, I nodded back to somewhere between him and....them. "...We'll have plenty of time later to chatter but let's be off. I want you all to take out a piece of paper and jot down a few sentences concerning what you expect from this ensemble." [rising murmurs from the crowd] "Come on guys it'll only last a minute then we'll start."   I tear out a piece of paper from my agenda and scribbled the following apathetically:   Well I'm here because I'll be darn famous one day and am writing this so that you can use it in the future as a proof to brag you had the privilege to work with me!   I passed the paper to him with a cute smile and sat back on the window pane I had been sitting all this time. His irritating smile spread on his face as he cast the paper aside before receiving others and placing mine on top of the pile. Then he arranged groups around the piano in a cresecent starting off with altos next to him behind the piano, then mezzo sopranos next to altos, bass next to mezzos, baritones next to bass, tenors (I was placed among them) next to baritones and finally sopranos who ended up on the other end of the piano....   ... It was fun, at least... but what was even more fun was when he read my note out loud during the break. I shrugged and stated, "Truth is truth." which received a few chuckles around. This is how Sprinter approached me for the first time to introduce himself. He was an all-smiles guy with a rather pinkish skin which actually emitted all the health he possessed. He was an athlete, quite well build yet unfortunately short. Well who cared? At least I now had someone I knew... Moreover, he was a tenor, himself, so it was a bonus (Actually I was NOT a tenor as everyone would soon agree but that was the highest possible male range... meaning, the only group I could fit in).   When we neared the end, Avarel said we were going to start working on Long Train Running by Doobie Brothers next time. We were passed out the lyrics of the song and he asked each and every one of us to obtain a tape and carry it along with us. They were going to record each song on our repertoire on our tapes individually so that we could practice the songs and our partitions at home.   Then again it was not ending here. He pointed at a few altos to practice the lead vocal of the song for Friday...   .....before he returned to me abruptly, adding "And you, too!"

       :: ENCOUNTER OF THE FIRST KIND ::   Timeline:  Past (Fall of 1995)   I sighed and kept swinging my legs nervously down the edge of the wall I was perched upon. So they noted my name and told me that I was going to be "called in" for audition. Every minute this thing was getting more irritating for me and some girl who was standing nearby, making nasal noises as if she desperately needed to sneeze in between her vocal display by singing out passages from Bette Midler's "Wind Beneath My wings" was not helping, either. She had a fantastic voice for certain and I would probably have given credit for that if she could keep quite for a second or didn't talk seemingly humble about (ie bragged) how she ended up as Best Female Vocal at the same contest I had ended up second years prior to her.   I was so bored beyond measure and about to hop down and leave when they called me in a way that made me think I was about to audition in front of Andrew Lloyd Weber for the part of Phantom (of the Opera). I was thinking if they really were aware of the fact that they seemed ridiculously artificial by mimicking a "serious attire" and hopelessly trying to create a fake atmosphere.   When I entered what was called as the "Piano room", I realized rather sadly that it was just a large room with a piano in it. I mean here I was at what is known as the best University of Ponderland, graduating the millionaires of tomorrow, thought to be stuffed with the most intelligent youths of the entire nation.. and this "Piano Room" was such a creative attribution to a room with a piano in it, it hurt. The tall, thin guy behind the piano which very much resembled the  urlLink Avarel Dalton  of Lucky Luke smiled at me indifferently and said "Hi".   ...to which I nodded and "hi"ed back... to which his eyes widened... to which I sighed... to which he asked "We have a tenor here?"... to which I thought "Dream on mister"... to which I responded, "Whatever. Shall we start?".... to which we started...   When it was over, I was looking at my nails while "Well.." he said with a half smile, "..although I shouldn't hint at the results beforehand, you passed with flying colors". I nodded and thanked. Raising my stare, our eyes met and that moment I realized the coming days were going to host some serious ego clashes between him and I. I sparkled back a cocksure smile to his belittling smirk, took my bag and started crossing the room towards the door while he uttered a final, "Be here at 5 pm on Wednesday" behind me.

        EPISODE III : Center Stage    :: PRELUDE ::   Timeline:  Past (Fall of 1995)   Upon deliberately failing at the Proficiency exam (For those who need some back up, this is the equivalent of TOEFL which is developed by the Oxford University originally. Some colleges prefer it instead of/in addition to TOEFL as a prerequisite) required to start Freshman year, I ended up as a Prep student. This was mainly due to the fact that I needed sometime to adjust to this brand new environment I was faced with. Soon, I was going to realize that it was one of the most accurate choices of my life since almost all the Undergraduates and Prep students of Bayside University were from the best High Schools nationwide. Mine was slightly above average yet it didn't change the fact that I was the only student there who had graduated from it. Thus, while people who were in the same situation immediately formed groups made up of old friends or acquaintances, I was all by myself... not knowing anyone... not having any idea of what to do next but to wait for classes or walk around idly.   The first day of school was disastrous. I woke up at 6 am to get ready and catch my first class at 9 am. Since getting to Bayside meant approximately 2 hours of public transport from where I lived (ie. torture), I was barely on time (but note that I am also a disaster when it comes to being on time) only to find out the classes were cancelled for the day. So it was 9:15 am in the morning, the first bus to where I lived was at 1 pm and I had 4 hours of blankness ahead of me.   Sighing, I found myself sitting on what the students were calling the "Steps" in front of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences and watching the daily activity of the campus. It was a sunny day in September.. slightly windy but not chilly at all. For a while my eyes scanned people hugging as they re-united, asking each other how the summer went and what courses there were on their schedule etc. It was a typical campus day at the beginning of a semester, indeed. However for me, it meant something more than that.... I needed to overcome this obstacle of being lonely. I mean I have nothing against being by myself but being lonely is a different thing. No matter how I feel, what I go through or need for the moment, I must be connected to people in one way or another. Total seclusion is something that can literally drive me insane.   Still, the pattern of time didn't alter its course for me just because I was struggling to set myself free of the webs of misery. Meaning, the more I desired it to pass quickly, the slower it got. After a little reading and a little listening to Mariah Carey's Daydream CD (exactly 2.5 times in row), I started feeling odd. I mean people around me were either chatting, having lunch, a cup of tea/coffee for a while before they left. No one was actually killing time up there but me. So I descended the steps and made my way to one of the Cafeterias. After deciding what to eat in as slow motion as possible, I made my way back to the campus rather unwillingly.   But my musical Muse had, per usual, other plans for me. While I was passing one of the many boards hanging each side of the corridor leading outside, a huge ad caught my eye by chance (or by fate):   AUDITION FOR BUMC CHOIR   Location: South Campus, Music Club, Piano Room.  Time: 3-6 pm.  Date: Starting off from that day until the end of the week.   This is your chance to be a part of Rock, Classical or Jazz Choir of Bayside Music Club (BUMC). Come join us in this polyphonic environment where you can put your voice into use other than rambling and bla bla....   I checked my watch.. It was only 12 am. Oh well, I did not have that divine a patience to wait up until 3 pm, doing nothing...   ... I was still repeating myself that it would be ridiculous to miss the bus at 3 pm just to audition for some non-professional formation that will be made up of guys who wish to broaden their mating horizons with new girls and girls who wish to scream out their daily stress while they wish to broaden their mating horizons with new boys as I was climbing down the stairs leading to the piano room.

       :: TWO TO TANGO ::   Timeline:  Present   "I don't believe someone whose admirers list never runs out of personalities ranging from dedicated lovers to platonic devotees can ever know the real meaning of being alone" said Sahara, a female acquaintance from where I work who looked so in need of company and talking that I took her out for a cup of coffee at my favorite cafe around the corner. She was stating this sentence as we were seating ourselves in the balcony, covered with glass windows so as to form a secluded arbor against the cold weather. The waitress immediately pulled over a portable radiator near us and took our order with a warm smile. I knew that soon the owner of the cafe, Mrs.Rose, would appear to welcome me since she and her husband are very close friends of my father.   In the shade of fallen leaves scattered above the glass ceiling and across the view of a cozy garden that was quite popular all throughout spring and summer, stretching under us, I smiled an empathatic smile at her. How could she be aware of the fact that I was lingering within the same theme just the previous day? Then again, I did not speak because obviously she needed to be listened. She sighed as she went on, "I really don't know what to do, Aura" she went on "His mom's calling me was so unexpected but I tried my best not to show it. She seemed as if she just wanted to talk to this girl her son has been dating for a while. Thank you." She nodded at the waitress who was serving her coffee and my capucino. After she left, the girl continued, "I thought it was normal but then he called me later to tell me that he was so confused."   I raised an eyebrow as I stirred my cup trying not to ruin the deliciously rising cream from its mouth and asked, "Oh?"   She nodded back slowly with a worried expression dominating her petite facial figures, "She obviously told him that all I wanted was to con him and end him up as my husband as soon as possible. It is so not true! And that messed him up.. Then again, it was him who told me earlier that I shouldn't care about his mom's behavior no matter what she does because according to him that's the way she is. She also tried to separate him from his ex-girlfriend. Then why is he letting her affect him, then?"   I tilted my head slightly as I asked, "So do you want to end up married with this guy or not?"   She looked at me rather surprised as she uttered, "No! I mean who can know what tomorrow will bring?"   I sighed and sipped my capucino before I answered, "No one can but that's not my point, either. It's not a sin to want a serious, long-term relationship with someone. The thing is if you are hoping for something like that, this guy seems to be the wrong person."   She blinked a "Why?"   "Well dear..." I said softly as I turned my eyes towards the compass rose turning hastily across the heavy winds that have been dominating us these days "...for one thing, even if you two tie the knot officially this woman sounds like she will be determined to nose her way in his son's marriage at every opportunity. Second, do you find yourself worthy of loving someone immature enough to allow himself get confused with whatever thing his mom says?" I turned to see her lower her eyes, "Now don't you look so sad, Sahara." I said before reaching out and gently patting her arm "It is a win-win situation for you, you see? If he lets the clouds over his head dissolve and stands up for his relationship, you'll be the winner. If he doesn't, you'll still be the winner since you'll have gotten yourself rid of a mummy's boy."   She smiled slightly before she gulped her coffee, "I guess you're right."   I laughed softly as I leaned back, "Of course, I am! Now don't you bury yourself in misery over something which isn't worth your misery at all. Love seems like it is centered around two but let me tell you something I heard somewhere. It takes two people to form a friendship. For a relationship, you need at least three. You can never keep it out of third parties and that is how it flourishes if it is the real thing."   I saw a sparkle of amusement in her eyes while we heard the "Aura!" of Mrs.Rose chiming among the walls as she was approaching us.

       :: DAREDREAM ::   Timeline:  Present   Undercovered was I,  shadowed with the absence of a never-present you...  Restless,   as breathless and sleepless as I could dare...    While I was walking away the streets of Ponderland, a swift yet chilly winter breeze was forplaying with my long, dark brown locks surrounding my distant expression. I was feeling quite tired after such a long night during which sleep abandoned my whereabouts, pages of a half historical, half mythical book tried its best to drift me away as one of the endless quarrels of my Granny and uncle kept raping the stillness of the house. Yesterday, was supposed to be my uncle's birthday. It was supposed to be one of those very few moments we were going to practice the art of being a family no matter how we feel against each other inside. If only my uncle's crisis did not interfere and his biology's need to take a few more Akinetons did not arise...    Would you hear....share?  Would you trance this moment so I can repair? 	   I sighed and approached the corner where I could usually hear the tunes of a street violinist welcoming me from afar. It was almost a daily ritual for me... Something so abnormally a part of my life that without hearing that melody skillfully escaping from the strings, the start of my day was not given. "Maybe it is just me", I thought. "Maybe my father is right when he keeps repeating that it is best to develop a defense mechanism for these moments of inescapable turmoil which repeated itself when they were most unexpected". It was yet another attempt to temporarily relieve my disturbed self, it seemed. However, it worked somehow and I decided to focus on creating a resistancy in the coming days. Not that I hadn't tried that before, by the by. Then again, it was worth giving it yet another try. After all, I was the mistress of persistence, wasn't I?    Take my veins to cruise my being...  ...or whisper a hymn to soothe the pain away...   It was then I saw them. A lovely looking couple descending the steps of the stairs that led to the pass over the railroad. The girl leaned over and gave a compassionate kiss on her lover's cheek to which he replied back by wrapping a tighter arm around her shoulders, causing her to snuggle and harbor herself in his embrace against the cold winter wind. "The arms of love", I thought, "when two could turn casualty into something special, how protective they could be." As she leaned her head on his shoulder and they slowly passed me by, I did not realize a faint smile was spread across my lips while I thought something similar to what they were experiencing seemed so buried into the past for me. The last time I felt that sensation was so far away that no matter how much I tried to recall, I could only grab a vision and not the feeling. It was healthy in the sense that, it meant I really had no burden over my love-free shoulders that belonged to my past. I was successfully away from all the hurt, all the longing and all the shadows of a long gone relationship. That was probably why I was ready to talk about them in the coming days even more than before.   Still, as everyone else, I also had that corner of my soul which desired the flare burning somewhere inside every single personality alive in this realm. The need of togetherness with a stranger.. the need to be complemented by that stranger who would gradually turn into a stranger no more.. Biting my lower lip, I thought "Never completing, though. Anything ideal comes out of complementing not completion for no other person has the power to complete... to make you whole". I was grateful for the many years of experimenting within Cupid's sphere which taught me this most valuable lesson. I had my share of trying for completion, in vain. That instant, I craved the tunes of the violinist. I wanted its notes to tell me there shall be a time for me and him, whomever he may be, again.   Frowning slightly, I halted at the corner to enable the violinist to start my day, accordingly. Maybe I was late... maybe he was early... for all I received were the hurried footsteps of wintered pedestrians and the sound of cold wind urging me onwards to pursue my day and leave moments of dramatic longings be...   How much of a reality am I?   How much of a dream are you?  And how much of this dreamy real can wipe time's dust...  	  ...to fast forward you and I into us?...

       :: GATES OF THE UNKOWN ::   Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1995)   Whatever happens, happens for a reason...   ...at least that was what I kept repeating to myself for the rest of summer. When the results of the University exams were officially announced, I was delighted to hear that I achieved what I had always dreamed about. I was accepted to Bayside University (for our new readers, the college is the Harvard equivalent of Ponderland) and was going to study Western Languages & Literatures specialized in English Literature. I was slightly disheartened at first because my initial goal was to study Translation at Bayside's School of Foreign Languages. Then again, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences did not sound utterly repellent, either. Later, I was going to thank the powers that be for ending up in my department since analyzing texts turned out to be something I was successful at... and above all, something that I really loved doing. Since University degree is next to compulsory in Ponderland, I believe (apart from studying at School of Arts) this was the only department that I could put up with.   All my friends were rejoiced since we all managed to pass the exam successfully. Parents were delighted... They showered their children with pride and love thinking they deserved everything they ever desired. Abusing this atmosphere skillfully, my friends ended up receiving cars, holidays abroad, credit cards with boosted limits to shop till they drop, etc. All I got, though, was a pat on the back and a "We knew you'd make it". When everyone else was "gosh!"ing at my success, my father was the same old man who was always so darned sure about my success that he was not aware of the fact that this attitude lead to looking apathetic instead of what he believed it was mirroring, ie. his trust in me.   It had been like that all throughout my life. It would be useless to think that my first personal achievement would alter him. This is probably why there had been no reference to my father up until this point. He was the man who backed me up financially and constantly criticized me, that's all. My father's voice equaled a mistake I was to be faced with. It could be anything and everything ranging from the way I walked/talked to an actual mistake for which I needed some confrontation and parental guidance instead of unfavorable judgements (A reference goes to the logs covering my childhood. Remember, I told you that when I was a little child, I was susceptible to such behavior from my mother in the form of physical violence thus, I was extra cautious against my father while he practiced a different form of the same pattern... Pleading guilty when I was not). After a while, I started ignoring his presence altogether because it was no use to expect some empathy from him. I was actually lucky that the higher education issue entered our reality just after my mother's death because it gave me an opportunity to stay out of him as much as possible.   40 days and 40 nights of celebrating success with friends came to an end when the Pre-registration period arrived. I was not dying to stay, anyway, thus, I started packing up and having said goodbye to everyone, returned to Ponderland. This time, my Grandmother moved in with us to help with our daily lives and taking care of the house which we were going to practically use as a hotel we didn't need to pay for from then on. Although she had been dying to be with us after my mother's passing away, we disregarded this idea simply because we needed some time to adapt and adjust to a wife and mother's absence.   ... As I stood up before the entering gates of my University on a day at the verge of fall, I took a deep breath and stood there for a while unsure of what lied beneath that entrance for me.   A brand new beginning or a brand new ending?

       :: FAREWELL TO ARMS ::   Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1995)   Deliberate neglection was all about Gambit's ultimate Scorpio revenge which I joked about and laughed at when among friends and caused me an emotional flux when alone. The couple emitted all the glamour of a summer affair, indeed. That is to say when they were up and around. It wouldn't be a gross understatement to say they were mostly down and rough-and-tumble. Throughout the days they were locked indoors at Gambit's and since it was located on my way to the beach, I could see the girl's stuff, shoes at least, scattered around his veranda. I was trying to make myself believe that it was all about sex and this idea was highly supported by Goddess who was the girl's friend. That was how Gambit met the girl, indeed... Obviously the girl's family bought a house in one of the many blocks built along the seashore. She was a newcomer, Goddess was her friend and her introduction to the gang had been inevitable. I didn't mind that, at all, honestly. Although Goddess was feeling quite guilty about this affair, thinking she had played a role in it, I never blamed her. Who was I to blame someone in this entire issue but myself, anyway?   It was I who had entered the dark waters at first place and stirring them with my subconscious seduction, caused a whirlpool which sucked both myself and Gambit in as it drifted us half drowned into different directions. I rarely saw him throughout the seemingly freewheeling days and lonesome nights. The house where he had disclosed his most genuine feelings to me looked so corrupted now as I passed it by a few times each and every day. Whether it was simply hormones or not, my intuition told me you could only remain strangers if you slept with someone once.   If you slept with that person twice you were no strangers anymore.   On the outside everything seemed so painfully normal and as fun as it could get since everyone knew this was going to be our last carefree summer. From that point on, higher education which meant the initial step into maturity was going to be a major part in our lives... lives that could no longer possess the irresponsible merriness of youth. Every night was a party, every night equaled a hedonist swim in alcohol, every night was pulsating with a club beat or meant bringing someone's house down. The families were understanding, probably because they also knew that this time it was not only a farewell to summer but also a farewell to adolescence on our parts.   One specific afternoon while I was returning from the beach, it happened for the first time. A cramp slowly emerged in my thighs, made its way up to my crotch and spread all around my belly. I was accompanied by a neighbor so tried my best not to manifest my pain but as soon as I arrived home, I couldn't suppress a moan. My grandmother was at a visit to a nearby friend (simply everyone loved her and she loved being not only with us but also in a neighborhood where she can get together with old people like herself and socialize. She had been living with her sister, my obsessive compulsive Granny and her manic-depressive schizophrenic son all this time so I understood her all too well) so I made use of the loneliness so as to endure my pain freely. I turned on the shower and sat under the pouring hot water for about an hour trying to figure out what was wrong with me. When the pain turned relatively tolerable, I got out, leaving wet footprints behind me, and finally found a few pain killers in some drawer to ease it.   I got dressed with shaky legs while I experienced the first striking fear which disabled me from keeping my calm. I curled up under covers, wettening my pillow all the while, and sobbed the afternoon away until I fell asleep.   It was my father who woke me up for dinner and slashed me for ending up in bed all wet. Ignoring his comments, I got up to realize that the mysterious cramps had subsided.   That night the gang's plans were to go out clubbing and instead of sitting alone at home and worrying myself to the bone, I got ready and headed to the beach before everyone else. Sighing, I leaned against the garden walls of a villa on the shore and lit up a cigarette. It was a most serene night accompanied by a crescent moon alongside the rhythmic symphony of the waves breaking with a crescendo and retreating with a decrescendo.   "Some things change, it seems. You are never early."   Or maybe it was not....   I closed my eyes slightly then re-opened them to see the shadow of Gambit sitting on the sand a little away. "Yes" I said weakly before exhaling the smoke "Some things change."   He buried his cigarette into the sand and came over to sit next to me and it was only then I realized the frown on his face. He seemed way too thoughtful than he usually was when he turned to look at me. It was that moment that I realized the many references made in romance novels could actually reflect truth. The tension in between was so dense that I could touch it. I had been there for more than a month and it was my third time seeing him at most. Not to mention our first time just by ourselves. It was I who finally broke the eye contact to face the salty breeze coming from the sea. "That and you are never silent." he said after a while, catching up with the conversation that already seemed a million light years away from me.   It was too hard not to cry right there, right then. However both of us knew that a tear would mean his victory in this game that I had started a year ago. "I don't like being silent." I said.   "Then speak up" he urged with a cute smile before lighting up another cigarette. Taking another breath from mine, I simply said, "I can't."   "You can but you won't." he said dryly to which I shrugged and muttered a "Yes". He knew me way too well to see everything I was thinking about on my face. That was why I was trying my best so as not to look him in the eye after the first contact. Then again I couldn't help an inevitable "Why?".   He remained silent for sometime and I was way too afraid to look at him, to decipher his facial expressions or his body language. "Can you..." he asked softly "....can you tell me that history won't repeat itself?"   He shouldn't have asked that. We both knew that it was the only question I could not answer properly. It was not my fault I was not born the way I should have been. It was not my fault that I couldn't love him the way I was, in the form I was trapped in, within a life that didn't even belong to me. It was not my fault that when I desperately wanted to run free of my skin and all the borders that imprisoned me, I could not face the world right next to him, holding his hand and looking at a tomorrow not closeted.   And it was not my fault that I couldn't lie to him... A barely more than a whisper "No" escaped my lips which was followed by an "I cannot".   About half an hour later, the gang found me sitting on the sand all by myself with salty traces of already dried tears on my cheeks and a burning cigarette butt between my fingers.

       :: TIPS ON TRACK ::   Timeline:  Present   The posts of yesterday might not have made any sense to many of those who visited this corner of the virtual space. Let me try to explain the why of those 2 previous entries with high hopes to recall sanity. When I visited my blog yesterday, I was shocked to see that there was this huge ad which shouldn't have been there. It looked as if it was placed right atop the title The Eyes of Aura Mars, grossly making itself towards the Phantasmemoria and pathetically ending up upon it. The actual logo was not visible due to this eerie replacement. I was shocked because the site was designed ad-free.  Never realizing this was due to a problem with the PC's Internet settings, I collapsed melodramatically in vain. Today, everything seems to have returned back to normal, peace and serenity are bestowed again and I am hoping to catch up with the Ontology as I planned.   Then again, this is not an apology for any inconvenience I may have caused and whatsoever. After all I am free to experiment all forms of insanity alongside my sanity, thank you.   Hence, let me answer a related question.   What to and not to expect here?   Although this is about my life story, my personal experiences and ramblings, note that free association is the narrative form I am most related to. I can guarantee that there will be times when you will come across a post which is highly symbolic and incomprehensible (Such as the recent ones the reasoning behind of which I have just explained. However, there will be many things that will appear likewise yet the facts behind them will not be revealed simply because no matter however unbelievable that may sound, even I have things to be kept private. Thus, the style, the mystifications can be seen as my version of a "lock" to this Memoir.) I welcome those who read to think and reccomend, upon coming across a symbolic entry, to take a second look at the material and find the elements that will enable them to apprehend their personal meanings to the various images in the text (it is the basics of reading/writing free association, anyway). Another wise thing to do would be regularly checking the Comments posted. Something that sounds odd in a post the previous day might very well be rationalized down there the following day. Make sure you skip them keeping this in mind.   Finally, I urge everyone who read to read/masturbate to never come back to this corner of the net again.   The title Phantasmemoria is appealing and deliberately deceptive in that sense but just because my life can get sarcastically laughable at times doesn't necessarily mean that I am laughing.

       :: STILLNESS ::   Timeline:  Present   *8 days and I'm still not smoking. The thing is, it really seems I managed to quit this time.  Occasional  Regular nicotine cravings have been dealt with successfully. It is simply that I don't know what to do now. I'm like.. well yes I quit smoking simply because that was the only challenge I could implement to alter the monotony of my life these days but what now? It is nice not to smoke. Then again I picture myself within the environment that surrounds me as a smoker and not a nicotine-free person as I used to be (That person also did Aerobics and cardiovascular daily, danced regularly, never missed an opportunity to further train her voice, was trendy as hell, was always on the search for expanding her self-improvement borders and just flash-backed to day and realized that it would be best to go through them alongside the Ontology instead of listing in a shallow manner). So, I still don't smoke but I don't like not smoking, either and feel like I'm back to those days when I was "smoking curious".   *[Attention: The following ain't self-pity. This is just another reality I have to get used to once I survive the initial shock, that's all.]   I despise, loathe, feel extremely sorry and even pity people who smile you in the face and gossip like there's no tomorrow behind you. If such are those among my family, I'd rather be an orphan thank you. I wiped all my mother's side of the family out of my life after her death just because they were disrespectful towards my father when he was absent but I was around. Alright, so they assumed I didn't like him, either. True, I didn't. They thought I was accusing him of my mother's death, too. That wasn't all false, either. However, he was my father! And no matter what I thought about him, I could never have let someone who talk/think so low about him in my life.   Thus, I ejected that side of the family up into the heavens so far away from me. As you will soon read in the Ontology, that left me my father's side who are all mentally sick and utterly unstable. Thanks to Fate there were only a bunch of them (3 to be specific) and they were locked up in their own mental and physical asylum, messing up each other's lives and only turned to us because they depended on my dad financially.   Fate had other plans, though. When everything in our lives started to shatter and there was no opportunity left for us to go and live with them, it was the same Fate that was giggling at me from amongst the shadows.   Today, through the paper thin walls, I heard my Granny and her son gossiping about me in such a bitchy way I have never ever heard in my entire 27 years. Obviously, they thought I wasn't hearing. I was aware of the fact that my father was switching between divine and dirt status for them occasionally but I never knew I was included to that nonsense, either. Like the burden of not being able to do the same thing I did to my mom's side of the family to these two lunatics was not heavy enough, I am now faced with the fact that I am also belittled, disregarded, downgraded and filthed upon by those who always seemed to love and protect me under their wings. True that I said that we were acting out a parody of a family and I was aware of it. Then again, I never imagined that the degree of humiliation I have been getting from them in my absence could be this trashy!   I am not that Polyanna enough to think that there are people out there who have never talked behind me. That include my friends, just acquaintances, those who just know about my past but never knew the real me etc. I lived in the form of a boy for 22 years and then stood up and altered everything about me altogether. That fact alone is trash material for anyone who wishes to improvise on it. Then again, I seriously don't think that the outcome of even such idiocy could reach the degree I eavesdropped today.   The stranger might take me as a slut and tries to harass my sexuality at most. However the so-called "family" harassess everything about me including my personality, my beliefs, my past, my present, my every single failure, intimate things only those who are closest to you can know about, my most innocent feelings that I foolishly disclosed to them at times... and taking my jokes as sheer facts, they end up deciding I'm just a useless piece of mud who has no honor, no pride and no life (which, according to them, is something I deserve).   Well I'm... I... I really don't know what else to say. Words fail to express how I'm feeling at the moment.   *lights up a cigarette*   Puff to that!

       :: AGAIN ::   Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1995)    That Friday...    That night...    That Friday night, I made my entree at Gambit's after hearing everyone was gathering at his place before heading off to the only club within 100 miles. I did not inform anyone, not even Goddess or Predator, about the exact day of my arrival although I gave them a maybe.   However could you take a wild guess as to the volcano erupting inside me?! I was dying to learn all about this wench who cast her hands on my...   On my...   Oh well... Don't you just love when you expect everyone in your past to forever remain head over heels for you? It is a wicked instinct which is extremely harmful in the sense that the fact almost always turns out to be the way it shouldn't have been and you are left behind with another ego crack to be tended. What was even more intoxicating for me, though, was in this specific case, the fact was exactly the way I wanted it to be! Considering this was the very first contact in my life that ever came close to an intimate relationship, it affected all the relationships in my life drastically. Consequence? I still tend to believe all my exes are madly in love with me and that I am so unbelievably irresistibly, undeniably, inevitably indescribable that.... *cough*   Anyway, as I stepped inside the house everyone gave this big, wild, surprised cheer that I was expecting them to give and yes it was caused deliberately on my part to make the owner of the house see how adorable a friend I was and how pathetic it would be to loose someone like me altogether (When I'm game, I'm game to the bone. I do what it takes to trigger all the right strings).   ...did he give a darn, really!? He was not even there among the gang... So where was our host? Oh he was upstairs... Upstairs?...In his room... with his girl... and obviously [insert winking chuckles here]... I desperately wanted to get drunk that instant...or collapse a Scarlett O'Hara flop into the nearest person available's arms feeling rejected (whereas it was I who pushed him away), unwanted (whereas it was I who seemed not to want him), unattractive (no use to reason this. It is a useless female thing), hopelessly stupid and... I couldn't feel more than this for the minute since he was there coming down the stairs looking so relieved and followed by a short, slim blonde looking so... well... you probably have come across that smirk on a female's face that goes, "I just got laid 'till I can't stand and believe until my endorphin levels turn normal that it's such a wonderful world we live in that it hurts."   Gambit traced a hand in his slightly long hair and nodded at me, "Hi there. Didn't know you'd come these days." I nodded back, glanced at the girl, managed a smile and even said hi before I turned to him, "It was meant to be a surprise. I guess it was. It turned out to be one, either." She got a nice body. That is if you could tell the whereabouts of the boobs.. and was she cross-eyed a little? And maybe a little too giggly?   He was standing right across me, buttoning his shirt. I could smell him.. Smell man and salt mingling in a fading after shave. Smell the afterheat of sex slightly being emitted through his body.. And all I could think of was to slap him in the face, scream a totally nonsense "How could you do that to me?!" and jump on to him right in front of everyone, tear open his shirt and let my hands slide on his chest down to his belly button then let passion interacting with despair and anger lead to system rocking sex.   But I was drawn away by Predator to a car and let all that I couldn't do to him embody themselves into music and rhythm around the dance floor all night long, instead.    Timeline:  Present   Another thing that fits today's title is a thing I did again. I have been a member of  urlLink OIA  since 1998 (We'll come there one day in the Ontology if we can). Back then it was just a small community really. I turned a most popular Chat Guide and along with my online friends we had so much fun and such intimate, real friendships which transpassed all geographical borders in between that those who got weary of gay.com's drama queens and visited OIA chatrooms turned immediate regulars. I humbly believe the foundation we built back then contributed to the rapid development of Out in America which is one of the most popular GLBTI portals on the net currently. Then again, neither of those (including myself) oldies are among the chat rooms any longer. Excluding Jared [the ever-silent], I guess, who was, who is and who looks like will be.   Then again, I like going through the profiles, rating people who I believe deserve it and occasionally see the pictures of those very few that fall into the you-make-this-world-a-beautiful-place category for me. I mean don't you ever go there if you are not gay or bisexual. Especially if you are a straight female like myself, don't you ever try if you are not in a masochistic mood that will force you to torture yourself by looking at various embodiments of male beauty who are all gay.   Just kidding. I like all forms of beauty and am personally proud to see that the majority of gay men and women do look after themselves and their bodies amazingly well. For me they will always stand physically superior against the bigotry rooted in obese societies that try to degrade them at every single opportunity. You go boys and girlz! (why am I exluding myself here as if I don't belong to GLBTI community theoratically? Well... I might be egocentered at times but I am no megalomaniac to count myself within the epitome of beauty category -but don't let that stop you-).   Anyway there was this boy that I rated ages ago and I believe is over-the-top good looking physically (if it is really him, in the picture that is. If it is not him, that's still fine. I appreciate his choice of faking it with such a great guy). Today I found out he also rated me 10/10 which was a lovely morning surprise. So I just thanked him for dropping by and the voting (disgustingly formal)....   ...whereas someone else in my shoes would have drooled a pool in front of her and let him know about it. I mean yes that is not a way to hit off a conversation with someone, anyway but mine is not, either.   It is so hard to be me, sometimes.   Cheers to you BiHotie!   (PS: That was some confession which can potentially be used against me in the future by my friends, you know.*sighs*)

       :: ICE ICE BABY ::  Timeline:  Present   I am often asked why Winter is my favorite season as opposed to Summer which is crazed by the majority of the globe. Well for one thing, I don't like heat. That is to say natural heat which is unavoidable. Take a shower, swim a mile, deep freeze yourself but none would change the fact that your relief will be painfully temporary. As soon as you step into the heat, the body re-adjusts its temperature. If that is not enough, this readjustment period equals sweat... that equals water loss... that... oh, you get the idea!   Initially, I used to love winter simply because people don't pay too much attention to each other when all they have on their minds is reaching somewhere/anywhere hot. They pass you by without a second look and when you are a gender dysphoric child who is trying to disguise his extreme androgeny in public the way I did, the semi-darkness, the rainfall or snowflakes that cause everyone to mind their own business is a priceless gift.   Later, I realized that I truly loved the melancholy of Winter which is not only a faithful company if you are antisocially cursing your luck but also a reason to adhere people to each other regardless of their feelings towards the season.   Cold makes everyone cold.  And when someone is cold someone usually craves for something cozy.   Thus, people experience times that actually bind them on a very intimate and personal level as opposed to summer times that bind people by almost always a setting. Winter forces people to cuddle under blankets or share an umbrella... She forces people somewhere inside so that they can form a link, communicate... Noone can underestimate the unifying effect of the cold.   As my breath smoked out of my lips, I smiled slightly at the gathered snow on the sidewalk. Another thing I love is to dress up resembling an astronaut and step out into the cold having defeated it already. Walking amidst the snow, being immune to the chill that tries to sneak in at every single blow of the wind is something I adore..   ..Today, I welcomed the first snowfall in Ponderland with open arms. I am sure many people out there who live in this city is cursing and longing for summer already. Well... Just as I longed for this day for almost a year.       This person shall play an important role in my life, you will see. I don't know what it is, I don't know how it will be but I have this strong sensation that something crucial for me will embody itself via him. I don't think it will be anything romantic maybe career-wise or he will be the denominator in an important fraction for me... Who is he? He is a little-known actor but is believed to be very talented. If you ask me he is a moderate actor and a well-educated person that's all. And no he is not my type of good-looking, either. Nevertheless, my intuition has always been one of my greatest powers. When something clicks my 6th sense, it means it needs not to be underestimated. I even knew I would find and loose my soulmate in this lifetime beforehand.   Sounds nonsense?   *grins mischievously before she turns and slowly disappears into the snowfall*

       :: WEIRDOM ::   Timeline:  Present   I live in an environment:   ...where a manic-depressive schizophrenic who has never dated a female before nor has he ever had intercourse with one, decides out of the blue that having reached 40 something years of age, he should have himself Viagra prescribed to boost his non-existent sex life.   ...where an obsessive compulsive woman who successfully managed to turn her son into the above, regularly makes up a physical illness that will enable her to draw everyone's pity so that she can jib at cooking and washing the dishes and suck up the patience of the rest.   ...where a 63-years-old man still tries to jump over the obstacles of life and fight against them as if he is still 30 years old so that he can give the life that he owes to his daughter back.   ...where a young woman of 27 dreams about a crystal clear tomorrow only to find out that tomorrow is as stubborn as herself so as to keep coming as mysty as yesterday.   ...where this quartet smile and act out a successful parody of a family every day so that when they are apart , they can whine about and, if possible, curse at each other and their necessity of living together.   ...where watching TV, spending a peaceful night, sleeping safe/sound, depend on the manic level of the schizophrenic.   ...where the meals of the week are set. Monday: Omlette & Pasta, Tuesday: Leek and Rice, Wednesday: Eggplants & Pasta, Thursday: Cabbage & Rice, Friday: Cauliflower & Pasta, Saturday: Just Pasta, Sunday: Beans & Rice.   ...where the corners and under furnitures of the rooms are adorned with 20 something years of dust, where spiders and cockroaches should have been sharing the rent up until the moment they settled in the apartment and over the years while establishing their natural habitat, where shower permission is granted by the Spider Queen living in the bathroom and the meal permission is granted by the Cockroach King reigning in the living room. (Kitchen is free play. You enter at your own risk.)   ...where this nightmare has been going on for 5 years.    Timeline:  Very Present   Coolangel has been talking about her boyfriend endlessly for the last 20 minutes but what's new? (if she could find a lover, anyone, I repeat, ANYONE can, believe me.) Her relatives living in Dumberland, have a Pittsbull named Jones. Jones has been a little itchy lately due to his obvious needs to mate so they find him a bitch. Once the couple returns from cloud no: 9, they get seperated because the owner of the bitch lives in Ponderland. But wait... what if the bitch falls pregnant? Startled by this possibility, the first thing the relatives do is to take pictures of Jones and send them to Ponderland with a note attached going:   "You're no bastards, puppies. This is your father!"   (Signed: A friend?)    Timeline:  So Past (1994-1995)   As summer came to an end, I was faced with another challenge. The two college exams, CEE (Candidate Election Exam) & SRE (Student Replacement Exam) that were waiting for me. I found myself among multiple-choice tests, countless books and in one of the hundreds of organizations nationwide that were specialized in helping out university-student-to-bes in this marathon. I turned a phenomena before the courses started. I was the one who missed the Bayside University (ie. The Harvard of Ponderland) with only one point, the one who graduated 4th from high school thus would be getting a higher bonus, who was tall, blonde and so hot (err I was just 5'9'' and as skinny and dark as I could get), who was the genius and the humble (actually I was ingenious that seemed like intellect and introverted that was mistaken for humility), the one who was...   Rumors get out of control, they do.   Soon, they found out that I was mainly funny, had an awkward voice and nothing more. When their hopes shattered, they just got along with me well, and consulted me regularly about the FLT (Foreign Language Test). I had great friends there none of whom are in my life currently. Still, those days were... full of competition lurking in every shadow... stimulating, if not anything else.   Once the courses were over for the day, I would go to my Granny's (My Grandomther's sister) who lived with his manic-depressive schizophrenic son whom I call my uncle and my Grandmother. It was the first time that I was introduced to the Coccoon (ie. the room that I stay at the moment). The walls of this room hosted two crucial stages of my life both of which introduced me into a brand new world upon completion. The first one being my preparation period to the uni exams and the second one being my transition. So I call the room, the Coccoon (It is actually my uncle's room).   In the afternoon, my dad would drive over from work, we would eat dinner together and then set out for our house. This lasted for almost 9 months. Many things can be said about this period of my life but monotony covering the hard work and constant study would be the best summary.   Hence, I passed both exams and scored within the first percantage (61st to be more spesific) among hundreds of thousands of candidates which meant I was credited to study Western Languages & Literatures at Bayside University. It was a tiresome winter for me again. However, had I ever gone through a lifespan that would grant me with the physical, mental and emotional freedom, I so needed?   When the results were up and around, we were packing up for the summer house. It was then I received a phone call from Goddess which briefly went:   -Hi hon. Congrats! I knew you'd nail it.  -Thanks. How's everyone?  -A little too well. When are you comin' over?  -On Friday, I guess. Why?  -We need you here.  -Spill it.  -Gambit....   My heartbeats turned faster but it was only a palpitation caused by the hot weather for certain.   -....is shaggin' this girl, day in day out. I guess they're becomin' an issue together so get your butt over here asap... need to run sweets... hurry up, will ya?...love you....   beep...  beep...beep...  beep...beep...beep...

       :: IRRITATED STRAIGHT TO THE BONE ::   Timeline:  Present   I wish sexual orientation were a personal preference. I would gladly turn bisexual, mind you. However, I am as straight as I can be and thus, have to endure all the imbecility straight guys emit as far as relationship patterns go. I want to scream on the top of my lungs that it is not that I accuse straight guys for feeling guideless when it comes to how to approach an estrogenic metabolism the right way BUT their extreme stubbornness to remain as idiotic as they are and refuse to do something about it!   *takes a deep breath*   It is all because I keep receiving these text messages from a guy I waved goodbye ages ago. Since he is not a major figure and I will not even mention him in the Ontology, here is the story briefly. This guy was an avid reader of mine while I was composing "Diary of the Night" online and we happened to chat now and then. He was so enthusiastic about meeting me whereas I was so through such things that my apathy was its extreme. Anyway, he disappeared all of a sudden and reappeared months afterwards with a girlfriend. Then disappeared and reappeared with a relationship on the rebound. Then disappeared and reappeared yesterday with a belated happy New Year SMS to which I replied out of kindness. He replied back going he was back in Ponderland (he works in England) and that missed his country bla bla (obviously his relationship was history)...   I was like... But what makes you think I'm interested in your life, I wonder. Still, being the angel of kindness I am, I wished him good luck, hoped he had fun and bid him farewell. This morning I woke up, turned my mobile on and immediately received 2 messages sent after midnight. One reporting where he was and what he was doing (?) and the other going, "There's a girl nearby and I suspect she is you." (??!!??)   It still sounds unbelievable to me after all those years of dating heterosexual guys. They still can surprise me with their nonsense. Let me tell you what is behind this straight nonsense, too:   *Guy likes the girl. Girl is neutral towards the guy.  *Guy chases the girl for a while then realizes that his target needs some effort to get to so goes for another one. In the meantime, the girl goes through the controversial "testing" period. She needs some time to figure out whether the guy's feelings are sincere or not so while she keeps her silence/neutrality, she actually waits for his next move.  *She waits for that move in vain while the guy finds herself a girl and thinks, "Alright so I didn't say goodbye to the other one. I can go back to her if things go awry or if one day I change my mind and focus on/give a second chance to her."  *The girl saves this period when she waited for the guy's next move meaninglessly to her RAD (Red Alert Disc) before moving on.  *The guy's relationship is over. He tries the girl again thinking since he never said goodbye and there are no hurt feelings in between. The RAD warns the girl immediately, she shoves his try in his face and walks away.   I so hate it all... I so hate to see it all, too.... but alas! I am a part of it. *sighs*   All I know that if I have a long-term relationship one day (including marriage), it will be with a straight acting bisexual hunk. I do know today that a guy who has never touched another guy with affection (the degree of this is unimportant. It can be merely sexual or highly emotional) in his lifetime can't ever comprehend the female psyche/needs.

       :: OUT OF ONE ::     Timeline:  Present   *2nd day without smoke: Quit smoking at the verge of 2004. Starting off from 23:30, I chimneyed my lungs to the downmost bronchitis not because those were the last moments my lips would ever suck on the filter of a Marlboro Lights Menthol but rather I wanted to get myself sick due to oversmoking with high hopes of its helping me loathe smoking slightly. Conclusion: I didn't get sick but I quit anyhow.   *Victoria's Secret presents Aura's Enigma: I don't know how it happened. Maybe it was because I was not expecting alcohol to hit me this quick or I was too ready to get drunk due to the longing mood I was experiencing.. No matter what it was, I opened the door of the room I sleep (it's not MY room, it never will be) in, made my way into the living room, hugged my dad and uncle, wished them a happy new year, turned around, fell on the sofa as the clock hit 12 am, happened to look at TV only to see women in lingerie doing the cat walk. I mean... yes my Granny was already in bed and my dad and uncle are... well... genetic (straight) males for whom a flash of bare female flesh is an immediate call for testosteronic attention. But this was unexpected. I couldn't believe that two mature (well at least one...the maturity of other can always be questioned) men caused me to step into the new year by watching Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. Like I told Daniel  .... As far as tradition goes, I need to turn a lingerie model. Honestly, I dreamed of becoming a model at some point of my life but 27 is a sour age in a sector where 17-years-olds pop up every other minute to beat each fine line you are destined to have botoxed in a few years.      Timeline:  Past (End of Summer 1994)   As I knocked on Gambit's door that night, I felt an insuppressible nausea taking over me. Looking back at that specific moment now, I can tell you that the reason of my anxiety was not entirely due to ruining the foundations of a possible relationship but also the fact that it was going to be the first time ever I was going to talk my gender dysphoria over with someone other than my mute self. When he opened the door, clad in nothing but boxers, a perfect tan and CK One (This is one of the two scents in the universe that literally turns me on. I can spot the odour even in a crowd and it still makes my stomach clench), all I could do was to fake a smile and step inside.   One of the reasons why I have no self esteem problems other than the occasional, feminine, "I'm so ugly" tripping is because I never felt rejected as I... well... let's put it together simply and say "came out". If there would be one advice I could give for all those who wish to cherish all the greatness being out brings along but have no idea where to start, it would be picking up the very first people in your life that you will come out to carefully. If through those initial moments of voicing the real you, you are faced with sympathy and understanding, it gets so easier to develop your courage to face the rest of the world.   He sat across me on the floor, nodding slowly and silently as I told him all that I had to go through by myself. His patience was amazing because when I stopped talking it was near midnight and obviously I halted just because I had the inevitable jaw-ache. Sometimes I cried as I spoke... at others I was like a 6 years-old who had memorized his part in the play, ie. as fast and monotonous as I could get. All he did was to listen to me, refill my coffee mug occasionally and eventually held my hands in his.   It was then I realized that I had not looked him in the eye even once all through the night.   I can still vividly remember what he told me after I concluded my monologue with the why-I-can't-be-with-you part. He said:   "I want you to know a few things. First, I'll be by your side whenever you need me. Second... no-no just listen and don't interfere... second, if you can't love yourself you can't love another. Cliche, I know but if it's this popular, then it has the credibility. And third, I tell you now and I mean it from the bottom of my heart that no one can and will love you as much as I do. But I'll let you go because you need it."   It was so much more than I could ever imagine that I hugged him, cried in his arms some more and inhaled his scent deep as I wetted his skin with my teardrops. I was feeling exhausted because of the sudden burden lift over my shoulders so he dropped me back home, stroke my cheek slightly before I got out of the car, closed the door and watched him drive back.   As I locked the front door, I was thinking whether he could stand for what he had said in the coming days. He did... Especially, as far as the "loving" part goes...   ...no one has managed to prove him wrong as of yet.

       :: SCARECROW - Part One ::   Timeline:  Present    Dear Aura Mars,   We have prepared a numerology report based on your bla bla bla.... Here is your personalized basic Numerology for 2004. An in-depth version is available for...    Lately, I have been unnecessarily burdening myself by looking at the numbers Rain Man has provided for me and kept going over the possibilities in my head a thousand times on a daily basis ever since that paper entered my wallet. I realized that it has nothing to do with my being ready for one thing or another. It is simply that I am scared to death and even the thought of it sickens me, hammers my head, makes me feel like scream and cry if not whine. 5 years ago, when I took a step towards my real self, I pictured a future for me that somehow got stuck somewhere and went out of my hands. Initially, the soap operatic theme of the script at my hands was enjoyable - 2404 episodes later the leading lady has not reached her goal still even though she has overcome a flood that sweeped her hometown off the map, escaped 3 major earthquakes, risen from her ashes after 14 heartbreaks, gone through 2 marriages alongside uncountable affairs, witnessed good overcoming evil approximately a hundred thousand times, built a business empire from scratch, lost that empire to her nemesis yet Fate has taken her revenge by giving the nemesis 3 children with down syndrome etc.    This is a year of progress and financial advancement. Major career opportunities present themselves. It is a challenging year in which personal growth is joined with new responsibilities and challenges.    After a point I blinked my eyes open and started seeing the big picture. Oh who am I fooling? I just realized that time was passing in the speed of light and all of a sudden I was 27. I panicked and challenged the chains around me and also realized that in time, the chains have gotten stronger than ever. They clinged on my limbs so tight that I was now feeling more imprisoned than ever I felt in the last 5 years. Because they were rooted at my hidden fears.   I was simply waiting for a financial turn in our (my dad and I's) lives. A turn that would enable me to give me my health and legal identity back so that I could turn around and face the world, my chin up and my courage restored firmly back at place. I never realized that all the while, I was actually imprisoning myself even more by this immobility. I was fearfully getting used to it and accepting it as "my life". I turned myself into a hermit, reading, writing, observing, translating occasionally and asking my dad how life was out there now and then. After all, he was the fighter not I. He was the one responsible to give the life that was taken away from me by their total ignorance to my illness all throughout my childhood and adolescence back.   How ironically foolish of me! What a sick way to feed on his understanding and good will!    This is a year of domestic responsibility and attention to the needs of family and friends. It is a time of heart felt emotions and some sacrifice. It is a time for comforting and caring.    Still, I cannot blame myself totally, either. The insecurities, the countless fears that gender dysphoria presents along its only gift named salvation are aplenty. People tend to believe that this is "a way of life", a "choice" of path, a "preference" basically. Funny how narrowmindedness (not bigotry, the former is even worse cause it forms the foundations of bigotry) can mislead the majority of the world. I wonder if people are really that blind so as not to see that one does not "choose" to shatter a life literally and entirely to create a brand new person inside out. People do such things because they simply have to. For the casual shatterer, the simile would be going back to zero and starting all over. For the gender dysphoric, it is going back to below zero, indeed and how come one may think that a sane person can "choose" something like that if they don't have to, if they truly mustn't? Perhaps it is just easier to think the other way around because it doesn't require some rational thinking.    You realize the importance of your place within your community. You will be called upon to help others bear their burdens. You are the proverbial friend in need.    I can never underestimate the outcome of this immobility period, though. Being a hermit definitely made me see what and who I am and what I want from life clearly and thoroughly. There have been many disheartening moments, indeed. Many times I felt that I could not handle another single blow. Human psyche is designed to carry burdens as long as they are uplifted slightly now and then. One may be suffering from a terrible domestic environment for instance and maybe a horrible career and a horrible relationship to spice things up. Still, there comes a time when life presents a little current towards the surface. Like the death of some unknown relative who is a millionaire or the popping up of one's first love at one's office as unmarried as he/she can get. A little opportunity to lift one burden, shortly. Although life has a balance and replaces another burden sooner or later for the one Fate has uplifted but still, one finds the time to recharge in the meantime.   How can one keep on going down the hill without a single uplift, is a good question. I wonder it myself, too. So far, I have survived the blows no matter how weary I may be.    You must work to create an atmosphere of harmony and balance. It is often a time when marital issues surface and need attention. However, you possess the understanding to deal with such issues effectively if you apply yourself with love and flexibility.    Maybe I'm buried in self pity. It could be, really. Maybe, when looked at things from my side, it is my narrowmindedness to sit and wait for a little miracle to happen. Perhaps it is my fault and/or naivete to end up Paused. After all, am I not the one who claims people are the outcome of their will? Nevertheless, I have never been masochistical, not I. Besides, why would I want to punish myself unconsciously? That is the only thing that I can think of... that I have been punishing myself for something so I ended up in a present that has a blur tomorrow.    These deep feelings bring renewal to relationships and often a birth in the family.    So yes I do admit I am afraid to pick the phone up and call this woman. Like I have been afraid of all other possibilities that didn't fit the ideal I presented above (Reminder: "...A turn that would enable me to give me my health and legal identity back so that I could turn around and face the world, my chin up and my courage restored firmly back at place..."). I just am afraid of any other option. Then again, I have to be truthful towards myself and face these fears that prevent me from doing anything and everything not surreal. I have curled up in one corner and waited enough, haven't I? I did what I must before so I have this ability.   I'm scared.  I can.  I'm afraid I CAN!    May is an emotional month filled with the promise and the stress of imminent changes. June is a breakthrough and a relief. September brings advancement, October self- reflection and readjustments, and December brings a sense of completion and fulfillment.    I simply need to build a scarecrow somewhere inside my soul.    *Numerology reading provided by  urlLink Tarot.com .

       :: COSMOPOLITAN HOURS ::   Timeline:  Present   After a sleepless night (hectic night) due to my father's cold (barely visible symptoms) and my being a truehearted daughter (Auralance Nightingale), I welcomed (cursed) yesterday morning in front of the mirror and found out (boiled with rage) that the knitted pullover I had bought the other day to cover the  urlLink Frankie B .ish cut of my jeans (the upper sections of my ass cheeks - I fell prey to the salesperson pampering: "Gee this is just the right cut for you!".. Uh-huh. Just as long as I'm standing!) perfectly suited its purpose (cover the ass cheeks) but it was so loosely knitted that the upper sections of some other body parts (was it over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder, Bette -Midler-?) were seen through.   Having no time left, I wore my brand new (Rain Man's present) Nike convertible (every present of his has at-least-two-birds-with-a-stone theme: "Oh Rain! It's such a lovely pullover!" -- "Not only a pullover but also.... *unbuttons the back*... a raincoat!" -- "Oh awesome! This is..." -- "Not only a raincoat but also.... *unzips the front*... a glove-scarf-beret set!" -- "My this is incredible, I'm.." -- "Not only a set but also... *shakes the sides off* ... a rocket launcher!") jacket over it and rushed out (No nothing happened because of the pullover if you don't count people men racing to seat themselves logistically at the bus so as to take a peek at my cleavage and my overall embarrassment since I'm not a full time exhibitionist but a victim of mindless shopping in this case).   Thankfully, Sister G. (my more-than-a-friend of 15 years. The only married member of my Holy Quartet*) and I were going to be all alone at her house and it was going to be a night full of girl moments (her husband had a night shift at the hospital) so it was perfectly alright. Highlights from the night include:   + How men change once they get married.  + Why men change once they get married?  + Shit! Men change once they get married!   + Wedding photos  + Wedding albums  + Engagement photos  + Engagement albums   + Class of 94' Yearbook:   - Who's this?  - Err... can't remember.  - Maybe we should try another angle.   - Let's call X!  - It's 10 years.. Do you think he/she'll remember?  - We remember him/her, right? [dialing silence] Hello ma'am/sir. I'm Sister G... X's friend from No-Longer-Available High, can I talk to him/her please?    Answers at hand after 10 calls :   X is married.  X doesn't live here any more.  X is at the hospital giving birth to her triplets.  How would I know where X is?! That )%+&'&!^+ bastard!  X has migrated to Alaska.  I don't know where X is. X rarely drops by anymore.  Forget X and talk to me babe!  Who?  + What women sacrifice to get married?  + What women sacrifice to remain married?  + Why women sacrifice to have a piece of paper that says they can get laid officially by a specific male anyway?   + The right time to fall pregnant  + The wrong time to fall pregnant  + The best position to fall pregnant  + Condoms vs. Contraceptives  + Contraceptives vs. IUDs  + Oh well I'm married! (Benefits of unprotected sex)   + Being overweight  + Being underweight  + Dead hair ends  + How to achieve shimmering highlights?  + Natural hair masks  + Natural facial masks  + Tribute to Cosmetics.   + Final Credits (at 4 am)   Main Idea: The monitor is swaying back & forth, my eyes ere burning, my entire system is craving to curl up right here right now and sleep for a day week month but it was all worth it.

       :: BEST NEW IDEA ::   Timeline:  Present   The bower was even more beautiful than it actually seemed from afar. Covered by glass windows against the rain and humid wind outside, it was a delicate mixture of wood and flowers, cozy ornaments and a decorative heater shaped as a fireplace. There were even flickering flames in it yet my attention was turned to the raindrops gingerly tracing down the glass window next to me while I was listening to my dearest friend Rain Man. "...so I quit the job yesterday...", he went on, "And now I need to pack up which, I guess, will be easy. If others can do it in 2 days, so can I theoretically."   I nodded and sipped my green tea before I asked, "When is your flight?"   "Monday.", he smiled softly yet I could sense the tension, the shit-who-pressed-fast-life-forward-button-when-I-need-some-time anxiety behind that smile. "Monday?!" I blinked, "But Rain... that's so... near." was all I could come up with. 5 days and my second closest friend was going to be coursing towards England for his PhD. Miles and miles again, I mused. "I know..." he replied with a compassionate expression in his twinkling eyes, "...and it only recently dawned upon me that this was something brand new I have never experienced before. A brand new country waving a huge to-do list in front of my face. I need to play the piano again. I haven't touched it for ages. Then there'll be new faces... All around will be new faces and all that trivia about fitting in into a new environment to be conquered." He shuddered and I waved him away, "That's the easiest part. I know that you'll fit in just great. Actually, it's going to be much easier this time. You see a "new environment" brings people closer. Did we know each other when we stepped into the Piano Room for the first time? Still, it brought us together perfectly, didn't it?"   As the waitress came to pick the empty glasses, we changed places and sat next to the heater before we ordered our lunch. "What about you?" he asked, a somewhat-worried-somewhat-interested cloud passed his eyes. "How do you see your future as? Aside from the fact that it is awfully blur, that is". I sighed and leaned back, making use of the delightful warmth from the heater enwrapping me, "I have run out of time, Rain." I said sternly, "All those dreams about shaking the world are about to be history. I am going on 28 and it is quite a late age to start a starlit career. I most probably see myself as a working girl and the only thing that'll partially satisfy the hear-my-voice passion will be doing voiceovers."   "Voiceovers?" he blinked rapidly, "You are planning to do voiceovers?"   "Well yes..." I bit my lower lip slightly while the waitress was serving us up, "...you know.. Commercials for TV or radio, program trailers and alike. I believe this will be..."   "Why Aura!" he snapped as he opened his eyes wide, "How come you never told me about this before?" Only then I realized that Rain Man had been working at one of the most successful advertisement companies in Ponderland as a Junior Writer for the last 4 years and not once had I thought about spilling this interest to him. "I... never... well do you think I can do it?". He reached for his mobile as he shook his head, "You must be kidding right? You have such a microphonic voice, the world knows it.... Hi, Sam, this is Rain Man I have a friend here who is interested in doing voiceovers for TV and Commercials, the most successful agents are "100 Percent" and "PonderVoice", right?...Uh-huh...Uh-huh... and who is she to contact?" He started scribbling something on a piece of junk paper "... uh-huh....uh-huh...right...We have the numbers at the switchboard?....uh-huh....uh-huh.... thanks a lot...." He grinned and dialed another number while my heart was beating in my ears. It was this easy? Could it really be my way out? A way out of this stand-still? A play button slowly coming into view for me to press myself out of this pause? "Hello, this is Rain Man could you please find me the contact details of 100 Percent and PonderVoice?.... uh-huh.... and PonderVoice?" He winked at me before going on scribbling "....3-4-4... Thanks a lot." Hanging up, he asked, "You have something for me to make a fair copy of this?" I opened my wallet and found a piece of torn paper that I kept with me for important notices. He copied the numbers and names down. Handing it out to me, his face was lightened by a huge smile, "Well you can always give it a shoot. Though, I'm sure they'll love your voice."   I was still amazed by this all and asked about the details of the business as we went on having lunch. Then we switched to gossiping about acquaintances and he cracked me up with his recent Japanese horror film experience. Somehow, I then found myself talking about my online diary and how it was selected as one of  urlLink Diarist.Net 's three  urlLink Best New Journal  finalists. After the meal, we got out and shopped for him a while, found ourselves browsing among Classical Music CDs, video games and books before we ended up in a beautiful cafe overlooking the district. The lights of the skyscrapers nearby were winking while the 5 pm traffic flowed in front of them. The rush hour was enhanced by a multitude of pedestrians trying to reach their destinations as soon as possible.   Good old Uni days were remembered, intensified by Irish Cream. That day his Russian instructor called the Piano room while we were practicing. Eowyn answered the phone and did I recall how it all go? Sure I did:    Russian Instructor:  Ahh... hello... what is there? (instead of 'who is there?')   Eowyn:  Hmm... There are people singing... err... and there's a piano?  And that day how we cornered him to go, talk to Kitty and opened up to her... that night when Charon, Bunny and I returned to the Study and all the mess I went through to wake him up (Darn! We were dying to hear what had happened and the guy was sound asleep!)... The inseparable trio: Charon, Rain Man and I... a thousand memories of togetherness too hard to put together.   While he accompanied me on the way back home, I softly sang a song against the windy winter afternoon. It had been supposed to be a relatively hot day according to the weather broadcast. Hot our a*s!! Standing in front of the steps leading up to the entrance, he smiled, "Well... I guess this is it... Wish me luck."   "I wish you the best of luck." I beamed, "I wish you find more than you can ever imagine up there in England... I hope your dreams and much more are fulfilled... I wish you and Kitty the happiness you have never experienced before."   "Well..." he grinned "...what more can I ask?"   "Come here." I hugged him tight and added an unspoken wish 'May happiness and success follow you wherever you go throughout your life my dearest friend. You more than deserve it'.   "Promise me to take good care of yourself whatever happens." I nodded and took a deep breath, "You, too". He raised his eyebrows, "Promise?".   "Promise." He smiled contently as he waved slowly, turned around and disappeared into the night.   The inseparable trio were now literally separated.

       :: HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE ::   Timeline:  Present   As we were slowly climbing down the stairs, dad and I were suddenly hit by the great mist of smoke hovering in the room, causing an immediate burn in my eyes. My dad sighed slightly, "What a crowd!" to which I nodded. The lobby of the theater was overcrowded by the count of heads of it and it seemed that it was soon going to be a hell once the movie was over and the doors were opened. "Looks like they did a good job" I commented, "They sure advertised this movie well, didn't they?". Rubbing an eye, dad nodded, "Yeah. Ponder(land) Cinema is getting much better every year. They're shooting more movies this year than they did in 10 years. Darn there's no where to sit."   I pointed towards the stairs, "Well we can wait there which looks like the only option." Laughter raised from a group of adults from somewhere unseen among the smoke. Leaning sidewise to the wall and turning towards my dad who was standing a step above me so that he looked taller than me, I tilted my head at his twitching eyebrows, "What?". He crossed his arms and seriously replied, "Turn around will you? Guys are eyeing you now and then and I don't want my daughter to look paradoxical in appearance." Paradoxical in appearance? "Can't say I'm with you.", I bit my lower lip and frowned. "The patches covering the holes over the butt of your faded jeans, beautiful..." he said sternly, "...over the waist you look perfectly well groomed... down the waist you look worn-out!"   I laughed softly and shaking my head, turned around and leaned my back against the wall, "Right. Tonight you won't get on my nerves, dad. Tonight is you're-the-boss night. See, I didn't tag my bag along with me cause you hate it for some reason.. Even brought along my gloves to protect my hands against cold... Now do I have great consideration towards my skin care or what?" I smiled to ease my sarcasm and went on, "Gee, how did mom put up with you for 30 years?"   The doors opened and people literally flooded out of the theatre with satisfied expressions on their faces. "Amazing...", "...cracked me up", "...were definitely good." statements scattered in the air as they started passing us by. I saw a seat emptying nearby and pulled my dad along while he was saying, "Your mom was an exceptional woman, you know. She was extremely cautious against such things. Things that bothered me, that is.. Like panty lines, too much cleavage and whatsoever. She avoided anything and everything that would made me jealous or angry in public." I sat, crossed my legs and he went on, "...In return, I tolerated the turmoil she caused at home. So it was a fair game." Seeing the unending flow of people, he sighed, "Now remind me not to come to the movies during the weekends next time." He frowned and turned around as a young lady trying to move her way in the crowd bumped him in the back. She blushed and apologized to which dad nodded and turned to me again. "Well I would never hasten to see this one but you were so cute when you offered me the movies option to soothe my mood swing that I couldn't foresee that it would be this crowded. It's the first weekend after its opening so, no wonder."   Finally, they re-opened the doors and we waited for a little longer before we headed inside. Once seated and the commercials began, I pointed at the white screen and leaned over to whisper in my dad's ear, "Now watch this one dad... there's this little girl who has an extremely cute gesture once..." But I lost him. I would probably loose anyone at that moment since when I looked over my dad's shoulder, I saw a global behind of a woman rising right before my dad's face before she stood back up and sat next to him. Poor dad watched this scene with the expression resembling an Al Bundy seeing Peg Bundy naked and demanding sex. He turned to me and stuttered, "Wh.. huh? You were saying something? Err.. I was taken aback by a butt waggling on my face."   The movie wasn't the funniest I had ever seen but I definitely kept laughing all night.

       :: ODE FOR AN ANGEL ::   Timeline:  Present Perfect     "Baby mine, don't you cry.  Baby mine, dry your eyes.   Rest your head close to my heart,   Never to part, baby of mine..."   This is an ode for a woman who had so much love stored in her soul that it would have made the worlds of those who touched her a beautiful place if cherished. This is an ode for a woman whose protective wings could stretch as far as one needed - if one needed love, they wrapped up around them in a cozy embrace, if one needed shelter they hovered above so that those in need would have been protected against the harsh climate of the physical and mental realities. This is an ode for a woman who had never given hope that someday, somehow those whom she had been loving unconditionally, (two generations who owed so much to her) would love her back the slightest of the way she loved them. This is an ode for a lonely woman who never put her loneliness forth; who was never loved the way she more than deserved.    This... is an ode for my Grandmother.   One usually realizes the importance of what one possesses when one looses it and how quite sad of me to begin with a statement such as this. I really do not know why I did not mention about this great figure in my life within Episode I: Early Years. Maybe, I was a little to enthusiastic about reaching Present back then and perhaps it was yet another urge to leave "...things belonging to past where they belong..." as mentioned in a famous Egyptian transcript found upon a Pyramid wall. I have given up this attempt a long while agone, indeed. Today, I present my yesterdays and todays the way they actually are - Entwined.   As I grew up and turned more mature everyday even though I so wanted to keep the child within me alive and give into her desires, merriness, carefreeness occasionally, I realized the difference between two reigning forms of love. Frankly, this is the real "quite sad" part of this musing. Love (and for Heaven's sake, I am no way near talking about romantic relationships), as I discovered, was either on condition or unconditional. For me, realization of this striking fact occured only after I lost someone who loved me unconditionally. Looking at the gap I was faced with all of a sudden and seeing how irreplacable it was, I was taken aback by many a things that dusked upon me. Dusked, indeed... Because no matter how beautiful a sight dusk painted on my sky, it also stroke the time of the Night and the day that was long gone. Once it would return, it would be a today and no matter how I wanted to cling on yesterday, yesterday remained a memory; a spectre that my hands went through whenever I tried to embrace it.    "...Little one, when you play   Pay no heed what they say.  Let your eyes sparkle and shine,   Never a tear, baby of mine..."    When my manic-depressive schizophrenic uncle started developing a sty on his eyelid and panicked out of it last night, I sighed and closed the book that took me to the fictional life of a fictional character whose fictional shoes I would love to be in. So much for the search of Ana Wills for the night, indeed. It was the beginning of the asylum turmoil. My Granny (my Grandmother's sister), being the obssessed personality she is, kept bugging her already panicked son and never let him be as she rolled the question: "Is it any better?" every 30 seconds. Thus, the inevitable happened and my uncle lost the plot, screaming, cursing and just being a totally unfortunate soul who, if had a choice, wouldn't do it all but couldn't help it. I am used to this portion of my life and so is my dad. We do get irritated, utterly nervous and after like an hour or so it gets too unbearable to bear but we still keep on with our lives. Imagine a guy screaming at the top of his lungs and cursing non-stop while his mother sits on the sofa either provocating him more with her dumbness or clad entirely in silence while a man nearby sits casually, solving a puzzle indifferently on a chair that once was comfortable for certain but now begs for "permenantly disabled" status as it rots in a corner peacefully. A young woman keeps entering in and out the scene as she pours a glass of water for herself, goes to kitchen to prepare some tea, drinks the tea, washes the cup, returns to her "bedroom", comes out and enters the bathroom, opens the curtains, wipes away two cockroaches amidst the mating ritual so the poor creatures start running in one direction while still attached to another from their backs and facing different directions, takes a shower in ankle-length dirty water thanks to the pipes stuffed with nasty bodily tissues and the water not properly ringing out any longer, gets out and heads back to the bedroom trying to totally ignore the shouts getting louder and louder in decibel.   If one can imagine that scene properly, he/she wouldn't be surprised to see that the young woman sits on the bed in her bathrobe, water drops dribbing from her nose now and then and whispers to herself, "I missed you Grandmother..."   "...If only you were here and responded to my call as "Dearie?"  If only you were here and I could see the compassion sparkling in your eyes as you said "Dearie?" one last time.  If only you were here and I could hear you telling me "You'll freeze in that outfit" even if the weather out there was 40 C. I swear I wouldn't get angry as I used to and break your heart with a reply like "Mind your own business and for God's sake be sensible just once!"  If only you were here and I could gently clear away your moustache with my tweezers once again.  If only you were here and cooked me my favorite milk cake nowhere available in this country as delicious as yours once more.  If only you were here and I could pull back the neck of your shirts that kept falling over your broken shoulder and revealing the flesh of your disabled limb and utter "You sexy thing" to which you always giggled.  If only you were here and showed me your sinewy arms out of an unhealthy, elderly lack of weight with sadness before telling me that your skin was no longer holding you in pieces.  If only you were here and told me that one special sentence which meant more than anything, anyone can ever console me with - If only you were here while life and strangers broke the heart of "that who is dearest to you" mercilessly and sat by her side, listening to her patiently even if you didn't understand a single word of hers and stroke her hand with love beyond words, whispering, "It'll be allright"."     "...If they knew all about you, 	 They'd end up loving you, too. 	  All those same people who scold you,  What they'd give just for the right to hold you...."    Yes my Guadian Angel.. It'll be allright sooner or later... You were my mother, indeed... The mother I truly needed... The mother who actually raised me up... You were the mother whom I thought had written " urlLink Little Red Riding Hood " for me and me only and demanded you told it to me every night when I was a child. You were the one who tried to run to my side when I got attacked on the way home by a purse-snatcher and luckily escaped with only a swollen scratch on my cheek. Everyone else blamed me for being on the streets at 9 pm and thought that I "deserved it" and that it would be a lesson for me while I shivered with fear and was crying uncontrollably and heard your faint voice said, "I will go and see if she needs anything" (But dad stopped you, didn't he? And you came into my Cocoon first thing in the morning... you hugged me so tight and cried as you touched the wound on my face... and you moaned "How could they do it to you, my baby?!").   Still I could never love you the way I wanted to... I was so lost trying to find my way that I couldn't... But is that an excuse, really? Could that be an excuse?   And as I sat there on the bed, clad in my bathrobe, plugging my ears, trying to be as deafened as possible towards the rage that was growing in the living room, I missed you, Grandmother. You who was always degraded and ignored by those that you gave yourself to.    I missed you so very much!     "...From your head down to your toes,  You're not much, goodness knows.   But you're so precious to me,  	 Sweet as can be, 	  Baby of mine..."

       :: RAIN OF UNIMPORTANCE ::   Timeline:  Present   The owner of the bouquiniste smiled at me and gestured for me to come inside, "Don't you wait there, child. Come in! It's freezing outside." Sniffing out of cold a little, I stepped in with gratitude and was immediately surrounded by the welcoming warmth being emitted from the electric heating. "Thank you..." I said unwrapping my scarf "...I thought my dad was going to be around by now. We'd meet here at 5 pm." He smiled and shook his head slightly, "I'm sure he'll arrive any minute. Take a look at those books in English we've purchased just recently." Nodding, I walked towards the adjacent opening which led to a huge room filled with bookshelves overloaded with countless pieces of writing by countless authors from around the globe. I inhaled deeply, savoring the smell of old book reigning within that part of the store. All these things were the products of various minds yet to be discovered... various worlds yet to be journeyed... various ideas yet to be added to my palette of scattered approaches towards technicolored concepts.   Crouching, I started going through the shelves, no matter how hard it was to get a hold on them one by one. Spotting a huge pile of Harlequin Romances and books pulsating with the idealization of feminine desire, I couldn't help but recall those weekends at my best friend's. We used to call them "Harlequin Weekends" which were specifically arranged for girls curling up (this is an obligatory trip... the female curl up while they read/watch something romantic) on various spots of the living room as husks of sunflower seeds slowly tower next to them. Not aware of the fact that I was smiling, I reached for a rather colorful looking cover and ended up holding a book titled "One Hit Wonder" by some author called Lisa Jewell. I had been feeling a little dizzy with my literary sessions lately mainly due to the fact that I was reading Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard who, after almost a hundred pages, still so buried in explaining cells and demons that he couldn't manage to start describing the basics of Dianetics therapy and how one could get rid of the negative experiences of unconsciousness (ie. engrams) so as to boost their mental potential (after all, this last thing is why, as claimed on the cover, 7 million people worldwide bought the damn book). Holding on to this discovery following the Bridget Jones genre, I got up and headed out to the next room where the owner was busy selling alluring looking pens to a teenager.   I took my mobile out and dialed my dad's only to be informed that "the person I had called could not be yada yada." (You missed him love. You're gonna either drag yourself back home and soak your cute little butt under the rainpour or try to look even cuter each minute to the owner of the store so he won't kick you out for mistaking his store for a bus stop). I sighed as I hang up and peered at the rain melting the last traces of the snow away from the streets not knowing what to curse first. My lack of weather prediction and leaving my umbrella back home or the rain that had been sweeping a sight that I had great affection towards?   I was a little taken away by these musings that I couldn't help but shriek at the nose pressing against the door from the other side. My father was a childish sight to be seen with his nostrils flaring out on the glass while he was smirking at me. I opened the door and was so close to yelling "What the...!?" but thanks to my common sense rushing forth and whispering "You're being expected to act with manners in public, woman!", I bit my tongue and grinned back. After all, he was funny when you thought twice (He really IS funny, indeed. The only thing is you have to practice thinking twice a lot).   Once outside, being the gentleman he is, my father disregarded his load (he was trying to carry 3 huge plastic bags the ingredients of which I really didn't want to know after that bathrobe experience a while ago) and chivalrously held the umbrella for the two of us.... well the problem is... everytime he does this we end up unable to walk properly because I'm taller than him (He's 5'7'' and I'm 5'9'' + heels). So the outcome of his chivalry is either me trying to be as acrobatically defensive as possible against the iron dangerously poking out of the ends of the umbrella randomly while it threatens my visual perception or me bumping my head against the stretched nylon thus causing my dad to loose the umbrella's control. Umbrella control is a difficult skill, indeed, which requires loads of practice for proficiency (likewise, anyone who tries using an umbrella against a hurling wind is prone to have a pissed story).   "Well..." my father said as we were halfway towards the apartment "....guess what happened today?" I tried my best to avoid the book slipping through my hands when a car turned around the corner abruptly and we were forced towards the sidewalk reflexively as my father punched me on the chin with his hand that carried the umbrella. "What....?" I mumbled when we were back on track again. "Today I dropped by at the Ponderland Artists Association to see a few old faces. Ritzy (Mr. Ritzy is still a popular TV and Theater actor in Ponderland) took out an album and showed me a picture from like...." He paused as we crossed the road in heavy traffic "....40 years ago... From the staging of "Second Edition"... It was from a scene including me carrying (some female name I cannot remember now) on my shoulder and Ritzy reaching out a hand in protest... Made me feel..."   And he went on describing how amazing those days of acting for him. As we entered the apartment, he was still musing about those days while I, on the other hand, was suffering from cluttering teeth and quite assured (once again) that I inherited the musing and chattering genes from him. After all, I managed to add 7 paragraphs that say nothing in particular to my Memoir, didn't I?

       :: WHY NOT! ::   Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1996)   Approximately a week after the "show", Avarel called me to inform there was a meeting at the cafeteria and that he could pick me up in about an hour if it was alright with me. Stuffing a shirt in a bag while holding the phone between my shoulder and cheek I went, "A meeting? In an hour? What for?" -- A hopeless attempt to buy myself some time while I was packing up for the summer house. Goddess was a little too enthusiastic about my arrival not because of Gambit, this time, (they were all rest assured that I had made my mind up about the subject and further talk would be unnecessary) but because she desperately was in need of me for some "top secret" reason. She was one of those who was closest to me back then so I couldn't let her down.. That and I really needed some time away from everything and was looking forward to a long, sunny holiday. While I was wondering as to the why of Goddess's plea and where on earth I put that favorite jeans of mine, I missed Avarel's answer and barely caught him up as he finished, ".. and you sure need to be there."   "Whatever..." I waved him away "I'll be ready in an hour." Hanging up, my grandmother came into the room and smiled one of her angelic smiles, "Are you going out, dearie?". Half of me buried in the wardrobe, I replied, "Uh..huh...". "Do you want me to fix you something to eat or will you eat out?" Two shirts flied out of the wardrobe and landed on the bed as I retreated, hair ruffled and panting, "Do you know where my favorite jeans are?". "Ah dearie... How can I know? You always yell at me whenever I try to tidy you so I gave it up." Shaking my head slightly I sighed, "How come people always fail you when you most need them? Were you saying something?" I went back searching a pile of clothing when she repeated her question. "No... " I responded thoughtfully before a loud "Voila!!" followed my success "Now how come this ended up in a box full of novels?" (Whereas the question should have been: How come a box full of novels ended up in the wardrobe?)   -----------------------------   While we were driving in the car, Avarel made me listen to the taped show. I have to admit no matter how cacophonic the background was, the lead vocals were surprisingly clear and coming out successful. "You know a new music channel was recording the entire show, right?". I lit up a cigarette and partially lowered the window, "Hmm... I noticed a camera, indeed though I thought it was for the club's archives." He smirked as he shifted the gear, "Well not exactly. Cheer up you've been on TV. People called me to tell they were showing captions from the show now and then..." He looked at me from the corner of his eye and added "I haven't seen it but they say Long Train Running is coming out entirely as the credits roll." Leaning back comfortably, I smoked out an indifferent statement "Yay, I'm famous." His chuckle instead of a reply brought along silence.   -----------------------------   "So..." Avarel began surrounded by almost 20 members of the Music Club, mostly choir members "...many of you have heard the rumors about my thoughts about forming a professional structure out of this ensemble. You guys have been terrific really and your talent cannot be left unnoticed. The thing is I am planning to form a polyphonic group which will go through long hours of practice and finally record an album." Satisfied by the astonished gasps, he went on, "I have a few names in my mind but for the rest an auction will be held twice. There'll be one before you guys return home for summer and another just as the Fall Semester starts in October. This is gonna be something brand new for Ponderland.. something like a more crowded version of  urlLink Manhattan Transfer ... Keep in mind we are doing this for a purpose. This won't be for the fun of it but will be a serious, professional group so if you're into casualty this won't be for you. Think twice before you audition... So what do you say guys? Are you up for it?" Plastic tea cups were raised one by one to toast for the idea before Avarel turned to me with his famous smirk and added, "...Are you?"   I paused for an instant before I reached for my cup and responded, "Well..." I turned to him with a half smile cunningly placed on the verge of my lips, "I'm game if you are."

       :: DREAM CHILD* ::   Timeline:  Present   I woke up with dried tears on my cheeks as I despised every second of misery I had been going through within my unconscious. Deep inside, I was stuffed with more tears to come yet I gulped them down no matter how much I needed to spill those offspring of personal sadness upon my pillow. Every single one of those drops is priceless since I, with a clear conscious, can say that I have never ever shed  urlLink crocodile tears  in my entire life. I have, thankfully, managed to keep the purity, the genuinity of the only remaining sign of weakness I possessed whether they are shed in loneliness or in the company of another. (Though, I am certain many others ranging from mere acquaintances to history-to-be partners/boyfriends saw question marks instead of tears running down my according to their will).   With swollen eyes, I shakily opened the door of the Cocoon, only to run into my dad entering the bathroom. He sparkled a huge smile to me to which I sniffed and nodded back while I made my way towards the rotting kitchen to prepare the breakf(e)ast. The implication comes from the fact that we "feast" over ready-made tea, cream cheese, a jar of cherry/peach marmalade, petit beurre biscuits and a few slices of bread. I have long forgotten how it felt to start the day with omelet and cereal alongside fresh fruits or French toasts, well-steeped tea or French Vanilla. Were those mornings full of these really 5 years ago? I dropped a little-Lipton-bagful of tea in a pot and sat on the low chair my Granny use to rest as she cooks. Tying my hair in a knot, I tried to cast the emotions stirring within me away. They were cruel and I needed not cruelty at the moment. They emitted an unattainable happiness yet I could differentiate them one by one as I tried to break myself free of the sense of reality a dream could bring along. It was so real.... the velvety, flawless skin of the baby's cheek leaning against mine. His warm, vulnerable form against my chest as my arms compassionately hugged him.... the delightful weariness of afterbirth... It was all so real that I could not stand its impossibility.   The sound of boiling tea running over from the edges of the pot and hissing against the cookstone called me back to the "actual" reality. Washing the tea cups and picking them up with one hand while I carried the tea pot with the other, I headed back towards the dining room (where my father sleeps on a sofa) and placed them on the table before I turned around and went out to fetch the rest of the breakfast from the fridge. When I returned, my father was drying his face with his towel hanging from the back of a chair. We sat silently and I didn't hear him talking to me until he raised his voice a little, asking me, "What's the matter beautiful?"   Opening the cream cheese can, I reached for the knife as I muttered, "Dad I think I'll be feeling quite moody today so don't think it has anything to do with you or with our life or any burden available on our shoulders, okay? I had a dream which really hit me quite bad with its feeling too real to bear."   He nodded yet tilted his head slightly as he munched on a piece of bread, "Wanna talk about it?" I actually knew that he didn't want to talk about it in details. He was asking out of curtsey but I knew that he was, at least, expecting a few sentences stating the cause of my pout. Taking a deep breath, I cast the knife aside and leaned my elbows on the table, "I....I.... had a baby in my dream. I gave birth to a baby boy and they brought him to the hospital room where I was resting after birth. The father was also there, waiting in anticipation but I cannot recall him visually... The only thing I recall is the feeling of anxiety to caress my baby and so much love towards the father of him...." I was not expecting to go into the details as I mention before yet it was all coming out of my lips against my will. I couldn't hinder myself from talking about it regardless of how silent I should have been, "...then they brought him along and I reached my arms out for him before holding him gently in my caress.... I could hear him breathing.... I could feel his skin as we were cheek to cheek... his fingers grasping a finger of mine... and I can lucidly recall the moment I uttered...." I closed my eyes as insuppressible tears made their way out, "I will take care of you, dearest. I will watch over you and look after you so that you will not suffer everything I did."   Dad reached over and held my hand in his-- A reaction I was not expecting from him at that point, honestly. He softly said, "Your unconscious had a powerful reflection. Interesting though. You never had strong maternal instincts as far as you told me. Have you read anything before going to bed regarding these?" I shook my head slightly, "No... I haven't.... I guess...." I sniffed and wiped away a tear, "I guess, as I grow older, I am showing off the signs of all women my age." A sigh escaped me before my father leaned back and nodded as he went on with his breakfast, "Perfectly natural, beautiful." He turned to me and winked, "Perfectly natural".   Later, while I was getting ready to head out, I realized that this mood swing was going to linger until it faded away naturally. I could not disregard it, nor could I fight against it. Still, I instinctively knew what I need... I definitely need to make love (not give birth to a baby nor lament for my disabilty of it as many would err to think. I've passed beyond these "consciously", at least)... and the vacuum of love alongside someone to love me in the process is not making things any better but I will cope with it.   Just as I cope with zillion other things that are craved for yet not possessed.    *Dream Child is also the 5th episode of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" series.. A sequel that gave its title to this entry for a reason.

       :: NOWHERE TO GET ::   Timeline:  Present   "It is not that I think you are indifferent, Aura" His voice was coming in that deep, rather choked tone of his which successfully hid anything that he actually thought or felt for the minute "It is simply that you are avoiding yourself from me and I want to know the why of it."   I sighed as I leaned my back against the cold wall, trembling a little as I did so. Bypassers were throwing casual glances at me and the snow that still didn't melt away due to the reigning cold was crunching beneath their feet occasionally as they strived to keep their balance. "It is in vain..." I mumbled into my mobile, "...why are you trying to open a book that's already out of date and of no validity?"   He cursed somewhat and I could vividly picture him running a hand over his stubble. The way he always did whenever he tried to make something clear in his mind and go for a new approach to convey his thoughts accurately, "Perhaps it's because that book has never been closed as opposed to what you always claim it did?... that it's still half empty and the last scribbles of writing available within doesn't fit in for a plausable ending?"   "And what makes you think they don't?" I stressed, frowning slightly as I pulled the fake fur adorning the ends of my jacket tighter around me and tried to cross my arms across my chest clumsily. My hands were a pale white with a pinch of red on the knuckles; an evident sign of the cold I had to endure yet I didn't know whether it was the weather or my blood that felt drawn with anxiety "What makes you think that the story is to be finished? Some things are better left alone and you taught me that well years ago. It is of no use to dig into past over and over again as if we can resurrect something that's long dead."   Silence was the reply which I hated. I definitely didn't like to go through it again and again when I knew it was a loose-loose situation. "I made a choice, Gambit." I said, trying not to fell prey to the tension building between us through the unseen wires that connected us "I made a choice so as not to have a relationship until I pull my life back together and even when the time comes, I will not be searching my phone book to scan all those past affairs and check the possibility to try them again. I will simply let it go towards an unknown future and will give myself and someone brand new a chance. Besides..." I took a deep breath and suppressed a shiver that tried to make its way all through my body with a futile attempt to tremble me violently. "...what makes you think that you and I stand chance when all you ever do is to pop in and out of my life in annual intervals?.... that and when you are on and off relationship with the same girl for darn 8 years now?.. when did you step aside, set everything aside to stand by me unless I told you I needed you?"   "Bullshit!" he hissed into my ear and I could hear his utmost anger transpassing miles, roads, hours and slapping me on the face, "When did you *ucking give me a chance to stand by you?... and when will I learn to let you be with your damn unsurpassable walls of arrogance that you err to call 'reason'?!" With that he hang up on me and I closed my eyes briefly, ignoring the fact that an old lady was staring at me while she was passing in front of me. Once again, conversing with him eventually got us nowhere.   I may have been arrogant, allright but if he couldn't see the fact that my past stood between us like the epitome of an obstacle, if he couldn't realize that restarting our relationship would be of no use but to satisfy his curiosity as to the "what if"s crawling in his mind, if he couldn't see that with all the mutual acquiantances, friends and above all family members accepting me as I am today but never to accept our relationship knowing my past and the fact that we grew up together thus, all we could ever have would be a hushed, secret, hidden, closeted affair shadowed occasionally with the fear of being found out one day, on his own, then I was not the person to shove it all in his face.   Because regardless of what he believes, I valued and cared about him that much so as not to hurt him even more. It was and has been much easier for him (alongside Goddess and Predator who have been the only witnesses of this uncategorized thing between him and I from the beginning) to think I was an arrogant, self-centered bitch. Once again, I let it be as I turned around and went back into the shelter of the artifical heat by the radiators inside the building while I hoped no one noticed an old wound that bled no more was tingling inside me.

       :: MY RUNNY VALENTINE ::    Timeline:  Present   Cats are crying, Gates are slamming, The wind is howling 'round the house tonight..   The heavy snowfall revisiting Ponderland has been giving me the bliss per usual. For the first time in my life, I see snow on Valentine's and for some reason it makes me feel as if this day is special, like no other. 3 nights agone, I had a Moonwish, although I could not see the phase of the moon. Moonwishes are most powerful when they are ritualized during Full Moon. Simply one reaches out her hand towards the sky and the nocturnal orb, gently grabs the Moon in their palm as they ball their hand into a fist, make a wish and slowly opens the palm to put the Moon back its place. This is a game I have been playing since I was a child. I actually carry the word "Moon" in my real name for some delightful "coincidence" because I haven't decided on a name during my transition but my friends did it for me, rather. Still, that is a story to be told later. As for the miracle I wished for, I can now witness that it is granted to me. These last 2 days, Ponderland has received the amount of snow she has not for more than 10 years... and today, all around me is white, purified and welcoming... the streets are almost deserted... Yesterday and today, I have had the most splendid walks of my life among solitary streets painted a gleaming white. When I see people shoveling up the front of their apartments, I have to suppress the urge to reach and stop them. It makes me feel as if they are trying to wipe away something I have been looking forward to for so long.   I'm as lonely as a boat out on the sea  When the night is black and the tide is high. Oh on nights like these I feel like falling to my knees I feel like calling: "Heaven please find my love!"   If I had had the future I look forward to, I would have probably spent this day in a unique manner. Not because it is Valentine's but simply because a snowy day like this fills me with an utmost sense of connection towards nature. The integrity of my psyche surprises me when snowflakes waltz around me and more than once I'm heard to say, "I should've been born either in Canada or Scandinavia". As one can see, this has nothing to do with the fact that those countries can produce the likes of  urlLink Marcus Schenkenberg (Sweden) , Keanu Reeves (Canada), Jim Carrey (Canada),  urlLink David James Elliott (Canada) ,  urlLink Sami Vaskola (Finland) ,  urlLink Lauri Kalima (Finland) ,  urlLink Nikolaj Coster Waldau (Denmark) ,  urlLink Frederick Garlen (Sweden) ,  urlLink Alex Lundqvist (Sweden)  alongside thousands of unknown perfect creations of the cold climate lurking on the streets of the globe. It wouldn't be a gross understatement if I said my heart belongs to Nordic, thank you. There is something about the descendants of Vikings.   I turn the dial on my radio trying to find an all night station I want to hear a song I know, a song about my situation. Oh on nights like these I feel like falling to my knees I feel like calling: "Heaven please find my love!"   I would probably rent myself a handful of various movies ranging from creepy to romantic and buy perfumed candles to compliment my essential lavender incense. A bottle of Bailey's would be stored in the fridge as I cook my reknown  urlLink Arrabbiata  and sing away the implemented tunes of Fairground Attraction. "On nights like this", they are the best of choices for dinner. I would call friends choking on their loneliness thanks to Valentine's marketing and couples' total disregard towards singles that day as they stalk the streets glued to each other (honestly, I have enough glue for anyone who is up to present a DeBeer's set. And you really thought diamonds aren't a girl's yada yada? Tsk!). Whether friends joined me or not, I should be the thoughtful Florence Nightangale, I am.   Somewhere out there there must be a boy for this girl Could be anywhere Could be next door or the other side of the world. Call up my radio, give them my number Tell them to put it out on the air! There must be someone, There must be someone like me sitting lonely as a boat out there.   Setting aside the who-is-afraid-of-the-big-bad-Valentine's theme and turning truthful mode on, I would probably not have chosen to be alone on a day like this, you know. I have deliberately chosen not to have a relationship until I put my life back on track after my break up with my last boyfriend 2 years ago. Up until that point, while I was on the dating scene, I had had guys coming in and out of my life like there was no tomorrow... and that was also because that was what I "chose" back then although the why of it is still a mystery to me. That period taught me so much about guys and their relationship patterns and enabled me to estimate the motives behind a guy's specific behavior 95% correctly (so what's the use of this unless I turn "Dear Aura"? Hell if I know!).   Oh on nights like these I feel like falling to my knees I feel like calling: "Heaven please find my love!"   For one thing I am grateful, though... and that is Valentine's never ever brings along special memories to me. Never in my life have I had a proper relationship during this period... Oh no that was a lie. My last relationship coincided with Valentine's somehow and I was out with a friend because my boyfriend lived out of the city and it took like 4.5 hours for him to go back and forth everyday. That Valentine's he had to drop his family back home and he, oh-so-unsurprisingly, tried to soothe me going "We'll make up for it as soon.... who needs a day when we celebrate our love every.... I will pamper you in a way you'll never forg...". None of those were necessary, though. I didn't want to do anything special, anyway and for those interested, all he said went no further then save-the-moment-statments like I expected.   Find my love Find my love Find my love Oh............... Find my love Find my love Find my love   Allright that last piece was hysterical, love.. Can we cut it? Thank you... Last Valentine's, though, was the most memorable. Me who had never had a special Valentine's was surprised by someone from whom I least expected a surprise. As soon as I entered my Coccoon that night, I spotted a little statuette placed atop the bedside table. It was a young maiden, holding a vase on her shoulder and the vase included a fake rose bud with even fake dew drops on its petals. Under it was a card and as soon as I read it, I started sobbing so loudly that it obviously signaled my surpriser who came in almost immediately. I hugged him tight and could not utter anything for long... It took me almost 15 minutes to finally thank him with gratitude and love sparkling in my teary eyes. He squeezed my shoulderblades compassionately as the card slipped from my hands and dropped on the bed. It read:     My dear daughter, isn't your father's love enough?

       :: SPOTLIGHT ::   Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1996)   The time we had all been looking forward to was nigh and it's nearness meant more rehearsals on our part both as a choir and with the band who would play for us. I remember the extreme routine of these, day in day out and literally finding myself exhausted day after day as I cherished every leap day spent with some sleep. However, the truth is, I adore(d) exhaustion. I used to say, "If I'm to die, I want it to happen as I run from one place to another". Solara, Blondie, Trendy and I were closer than ever, running to and from Uni all together. It was during these days that I learned torturous moments tie knots between people. As we dragged ourselves from responsibilities (exams, finals etc.) to reserved hours filled with a passion for music, our physical weariness formed a strong link between us. Although we complained frequently, we loved falling asleep on each other's shoulders during a bus ride... and I believe this point is far from the masochistic label and clear to anyone who has pursued a lifestyle of their choosing.   Being tired and happy equals contentment as opposed to the disappointment of being tired and questioning its worth.   For the night of the Show, Avarel ordered shirts for us that had a crow printed on the front. Like the pathetic pun going to our utmost cacophony and individual lack of being bestowed with the voice of a Lark was not enough, the crow had a cigarette dangling from its beak. Worse, we found it hilariously funny and cheered once the shirts were distributed backstage. One thing was for certain. We may not have been the best choir the globe had ever seen but we sure enjoyed every second of our togetherness. We were a closely connected group of thirty something people which actually was the sign of Avarel's talent (if not for anything else, I still admire him for it this day) to keep the spirit alive and bring people around him closer to each other. It was this talent that also lead up the events in the coming days, indeed.   There were rumors that Avarel was planning to form a professional band out of some of the "selected" members of the Rock Chorus but how come nobody knew. He was a hideous guy, secretive by nature and never disclosed his thoughts openly. I was certain that the anticipation caused by this rumor was something he was enjoying greatly behind that smirk of his. That smirk also accompanied coming and going of girlfriends with the frequency of changing underwear (and he was a squeaky clean guy even with a stubble, mind you) and no matter how appealing this bad boy imagery for the girls falling all over him, I knew that it was mainly a mask that failed to hide his problems concerning connecting himself to people.   After the sound check, the tension got unbearable for many... For some reason unknown to me, people kept sucking pastilles which I found relatively funny since it seemed they were savoring them one after the other. Suddenly, everyone was complaining from an unbearable sore throat and everyone else was buying this blind excuse for the same reason; they all needed a miracle to disable the detonation we were very successful at.   I still remember that moment of shock when I ran into one of my childhood friends backstage. She told me that she and her band were invited to perform three songs on stage before us. She was not a Baysider so the surprise was duplicated. She really must have had the right connection in the Music Club... All through their performance, I bit my lower lip with anxiety while Avarel and the band members kept drinking nearby. Ricky, the lead guitarist, (nicknamed likewise because he looked very much like Ricky Martin) was the most popular in the band since he was strikingly handsome yet the plot being weaved then was unknown to us. Avarel's real crush (you know... the leading lady in his story... he loved her desperately, she enjoyed this and abused it... this was the main reason of the entire bad boy imagery of his, indeed) was flirting with Ricky who was a really close friend of his, right before him!   And I was told this and took a second look at them to enable missing pieces to complete the puzzle just as it was our turn on stage. I still remember the roar of the applause lucidly... the unnatural heat caused by various spotlights... the first note of " urlLink The River of Dreams " hitting the air... over 400 people clapping rhythmically as we sang and not caring whether we hit the right key or not. I waited ecstatically for my turn which was right in the middle of the performance... Before me Blondie stepped forth, took the microphone and nailed " urlLink What A Feeling ". As she faded out, she turned back to face the choir and I raised a thumb at her. We passed each other by and highfived while I grabbed the mic and faced the crowd.   All of a sudden, it was silence.... As if everything was flowing in slow motion. I swear I even miraged hearing my breathing in my ears... The crowd was bigger than I could imagine... From where I was standing they seemed like a throbbing, pulsating mass of darkness ready to blow. I turned to look at Avarel over my shoulder... If it hadn't been for that evil grin of his, I would probably have choked out of excitement... but that degrading grin of his filled my system with all the enthusiasm I could ask for. That piece of filth was going to see that I meant what I had said when I told him that it was his privilege that I had stayed in this choir all this time.   Ricky hit the strings.... the electro guitar caused the crowd jump to their feet and I closed my eyes briefly before opening them and sparkled a smile at everyone while I went " urlLink Down around the corner half a mile from here "... There were cameras rolling as I tuned myself into the mood, danced the song away and questioned "without love where would you be now"? Spotlights weaved an iridal around me, the reciprocal energy I shared with the audience filled me with a form of satisfaction I had never experienced before... it simply gained momentum until I could suppress it no more and reached a hand out towards the crowd to ask them "where would you be now?" one last time....   While I was panting heavily against the deafening applause, I smiled my first, real smile which rushed forth from my heart and planted itself over my lips....   ... for the rest of the night.

       :: EDELWEISS ::   Timeline:  Present   While I was on my way towards work this morning, I heard my unknown companion enchanting the winter air with his violin again. I halted briefly and altered my course, climbed the steps and started walking on the bridge above the trailroad. There I saw him finally... A man close to his forties, wearing a worn sweater and faded cargo pants, eyes closed as he was paying devotion to the tunes of his instrument while playing it. I slowed my pace and pretended as if I was looking at the second hand books scattered on the stalls nearby.. He finished the song with a decrescendo and smiled softly at the people passing him by.. He seemed content being there, playing his violin and didn't care about the indifference of the majority passing him by. From inside the old box placed next to his feet, there was but a few glittering coins and nothing more. He closed his eyes again and started anew. To my surprise, he was playing a song that was so dear to me... full of naive reminisince of my childhood... from a movie whose soundtrack is carved in my soul...   I tried to keep my mouth shut for once and picked up a book, pretending as if I was examining it while ignoring the ramblings of the seller nearby. My mind was so connected to the melody that I felt speaking unnecessary would break the spell. Slowly, I felt blissful by a thought crossing my mind... this violonist, without even knowing, was there to aid me through the last portion of my darkness and he was, for me, the indicator of the "new" approaching. Maybe it is just me... maybe I'm insane or a filthy romantic... I don't care! Thinking likewise soothes me and as long as I'm soothed, I don't care about the rationality degree.   I turned around, totally unaware of the fact that I was smiling and could not suppress myself any longer as if my voice was out of control, trying to break loose and accompany the ongoing song....   ... you greet me ...  I began.. He stopped... Heads buying books, selling books, thoughtful as walking by, turned to me but I just couldn't help it...   ... small and white ...  I went on and he closed his eyes again, beamed as he rested his cheek against his dear companion and catched up with me:   ... clean and bright  You look happy to me, to me.  I dropped the book and approached him as I went on singing. The winter sun was shining above us, people slowed down to make use of this accompaniment a little longer before they went on, two lovers linked their fingers and sat on a bench nearby   Blossom of snow may you bloom and grow  Bloom and grow forever   Edelweiss, Edelweiss  Bless my homeland forever  Softly we finished and people around us started clapping, cheering while I saw many, tossing coins into his box... I smiled to him, took my purse out and was going to do the same when he reached over and stopped me. His wrinkled eyes were sparkling when he said with a coarse voice, "Don't.... You gave me the best of tithes already."   "It was my pleasure.", I said (which was an understatement on my part when my gratitude for his presence in my life was considered) and turned away when he hesitantly if not shyly said, "Would you.... again?" I looked at him over my shoulder, nodded and slipped my hands into my jacket pockets when he restarted the song...   Edelweiss, Edelweiss every morning you greet me...  This time I didn't stay but walked back on the bridge slowly and went on singing until my voice and his violin no longer entwined... and oddly heard my father's voice yell out of nowhere, "How the hell is this tab broken again? Don't you people know how to turn on the water? Bleh!.. Wake up beautiful, time to break a feast!"   Realization is a sad thing on times like these... I murmured, "Get off me, I wanna finish this dream." to which he responded, "Too bad... And here I was thinking we'd arrange when we'd hit off to  urlLink Underworld  today." I blinked my sleepy eyes open, "What? How come? You said you hated horror films."   "Oh no..." he said as he ruffled my hair, "...I saw the trailer.. Looks like a Matrix-alike Wolverine vs. Vampire war!"   I chuckled, "Oh sure.. War is the keyword, I see.". My father is a unique creation of weird genes interacted 64 years ago and somehow managed to form a healthy male on the outside but couldn't effort to sensify the inside. He adores war movies where blood washes the streets, people strangle, torture, machine gun each other with transfixed faces out of violence but claims he cannot stand the gore of horror movies.... but all of these don't change the fact that he knows me quite well to rip me off the after effects of a dream with a reality so appealing.   "Ho-hum... now move move move...." He waved a hand as he headed out and I soon found myself muttering a song in the bathroom while washing my face:   Edelweiss, Edelweiss  You look happy to me, to me...

       :: LIVES TOUCHED ::   Timeline:  Present   Last night, I tucked my pillow between the cold wall and my aching back, curled under covers and with one hand in a package of roasted pistachio nuts, was lost among the lines of Amin Maalouf's "Le Periple De Baldassare" when my hands touched a slight bump on the back cover of the book. Dad and I get books from a bouquiniste (ie a wholesale second-hand bookseller) nearby where you rent a second-hand book for relatively a small fee and to tell you the truth, I somehow feel guilty every time I do so. Still, it is not my fault that the books in Ponderland are above average expensive and that in this financial state we are in, I cannot spend that much money on the things I want to read... that and reading is an important part of my life currently. Anyway, I feel guilty because I am well aware of the time, dedication and effort the author put into it so yes I'm sabotaging their sale...I will pay back by the truth that if I turn a professional one day the same can happen to my work, too.   I realized this was a dried driblet of wax and I just don't know why the heck I simply didn't go back to reading but closed the book and stared at the wax trying to figure the story behind it, instead. Tilting my head slightly, I tried to envision the hands that had touched the book.. the settings it had been within.. Perhaps this was a mark left from a power cut and back then, the book was at the hands of a University student, sharing a flat with his roommates. He was alone that night (mates were out for a party but he wasn't in the mood) and was trying to fix himself a dinner and thinking about his break up with the girlfriend. Why he had been feeling so much for her was unknown to him. After all she was very clear with what she wanted. After all it had started as a one night stand and somehow they kept bumping into each other and took it further into a physical relationship. He couldn't recall when he realized it turned into love on his part... and when he quit having sex and started making love to her. The beep of the microwave took him back to the reality. He took the plate out, dragged himself to the living room and just as he sat on the sofa the lights went off. Cursing, he clumsily searched for the candle and matches and bumped his knee on the table nearby. Feeling after the candle while cursing further, he finally located his target and lit it with the matches next to it. Taking the candle back with him, he placed it on the book atop the table... Lost in his musings while eating, he didn't even realize the wax dripping on the cover.    [While moving out, his flatmates gave a bunch of books to the old lady living next floor who always invited them over to have tea and home-made cookies.. She loved reading so for all the maternity that she had showed them, they thought they could at least thank her likewise.]    Her husband had died years ago, indeed and her children were married already. Turning a page, she sighed with happiness, thinking that her first grandchild was on its way and fixed her glasses. For a second, she raised her head from the page and her wrinkled face looked thoughtful as she looked out of the window. The rocking chair she was sitting upon was her husband's favorite. Her heart sizzled with longing and she whispered a prayer for his soul and tried to make herself believe that he was never too far away, that his memory was with her and she was certain that he was also delighted by the news of their first grandchild. The radio started playing an old song they used to love so much and she smiled slightly as if she was right. This coincidence was a sign that she was right... That until they were going to unite in eternity, his shadow accompanied her life... while the song kept on playing:   You know that old trees just grow stronger,  and old rivers grow wilder every day,  but old people, they just grow lonesome  waiting for someone to say,  "Hello in there. Hello"    [When she passed away, the books found at her flat were transferred to a library nearby. The book was rented from the Library, never to be returned again. It journeyed across the nation and ended up in Ponderland in a bag and was seen at a garage sale. A young girl bought the book almost a quarter of its original price.]    Her passion for reading was all that made her merry. She was an orphan, the adopted child of an old couple who loved her with their entire being. They devoted their lives to her and she never lacked appreciation for them. It was true that her love also never failed them but somewhere deep inside, she always had that question mark. She sometimes looked in the mirror and wondered who she looked like. Did she take after her father or mother?... and why did they choose to leave her be in this already left alone world? Did they ever look for her? Were they dead? Still together? Seperated? As years passed her by, these moments of longings started loosing their effect and quit causing her the sense of abandonment. Then again sensations might have ceased but question marks remained for long. She sighed and went on tidying her dorm room. The following day she was going to sell a few books to a second-hand bookstore. She was short of money due to her purchase of a few extra books needed for that semester. Boarding school was never easy but it was her choice and she did not listen to her parents' oppositions. Somewhere along the track, she had to deal with being alone, face her past and ceasefired with her childhood.   Once sold to the store, the book was not rented for sometime. Then again, sooner or later it was going to enter another life stream.. face another soul, see another pair of eyes, feel another touch.. A winter afternoon, tiny hands grabbed the book, turned the back cover and read the summary. She then took a few steps and said, "This is it.".. "You picked that? What is it? Amin Maalouf?" asked an elder man to which she responded "Yes... writer of Leo the African and Samarkand... Famous guy."... "You know him?" asked the man.. "As much as he knows me." replied the girl.. Laughters were heard and the book left the store, towards another life folded in her hands across her chest.

       :: MUTINOUS MARIONETTE ::   Timeline:  Past (Winter - Summer of 1996)   As my life was gaining momentum, my relationship with my family (ie. Granmother and dad) was going down the hill. My father had never supported my extreme zealousy for center stage and although he saw my talent, he believed that all I had was a fertile land which needed to be cultivated. He drew the line once by going, "Whatever you sing, I don't care. If it's music you're after, you should have chosen conservatory instead of an academic degree."   What he was unaware of was the fact that it was not my choice to study at Bayside.   It was my mother's last wish.   One of the last conversations we shared was centered around my future. I can still remember that winter day when I came back from school and found her sitting on the bed and knitting while a bandana covered her bald hair caused by chemotherapy and her tiny hands holding the knitting needles as expertly as if they were an extension of her fingers. I sat there by her side, watching her while we talked and she said, "Dearest, no matter what you want to be make sure that you study hard enough to open the gates of Bayside. Save your future with that diploma so that you will always guarantee a second chance in life if where your heart takes you fails you. This is my last request from you." Certainly, I opposed this last statement of hers, telling she would never have enough of requests from me which made us both laugh for the moment.   How could we know that it was truly going to be her last wish and the next day's chemotherapy would paralyse her, leading up to the week of her death?   I hid this request from my family for a long time. It was my only motivation while I was getting ready for the University exams and when I succeeded, I knew that it was not only the first, real achievement of my life but also a reason for my mother to rest in peace. Needless to say that if the strings of my life were at my hands, I would have preferred an Academy of Music/Drama but every turn of events possesses a lesson we need to learn. That is why they happen although we usually frown and think "But wait.. This is not the reality I chose. I didn't want to experience this." Think twice... I did so and I know that I wouldn't have been half the person I am now were it not for the people I met at Bayside and those 3.5 years I spent there.   So my father not only ignored and directly told his absolute dislike towards my passion for music but he also never missed an opportunity to nightmare my next day whenever I missed a phone call to let him know I'd be late or wouldn't be home the previous night. It was his house, wasn't it? It was his rules, weren't they? And just as long as I lived with him, I had to go by them. Period! One would have thought that I was miseried by this situation but on the contrary it only served to fuel my free spirit and my on-stage enthusiasm. The more he pulled my strings, the further I pulled back. The more he wanted to control me, the more a vagabond I became. The more he tried to fit in the shoes of Mastro Cherry, the more a  urlLink Pinocchio  I turned into.   It took years for us to come to terms with our personalities and accept that we are as far from each other as Pluto and Mercury when our perceptions about living are considered.   He didn't even change his mind after I scored an A at the Proficiency exam that Summer and was ready to start my Freshman year the following semester. I shrugged his indifference away as usual and celebrated it with my friends totally unaware of the fact that the more apathetic he was towards my personal progress/dreams, the more I was trying to prove myself to him unconsciously in whatever I did.

       :: IRRESISTANCE ::   Timeline:  Present   "I just want you to understand the fact that..." I said, standing next to the desk, loaded with books, a huge mug -a souveneir from an unforgettable night- that serves as a pen-holder, a schedule, old magazines and all the nonsense that makes sense to me that are placed as tidily as possible "...I understand your reaction from a few days ago but have not made a move until now because I don't think there was anything to apologize for on my part, dad" I said in a rather serious manner. "Please keep in mind that it is not because I don't respect all the things that you have been doing for me. It is simply because I have no room left to cherish anything."   He nodded and smiled slightly "You should know that I wasn't expecting an apology from you, Aura. All I was expecting was a smile. For God's sake, I could even buy a fake one but just smile! I now realize that it is darn right when they said a smile of appreciation from someone who is dearest to you is all that matters. That thing you told me in the lift tore me apart, it did...." He looked away and outside the window as he quoted me "...none of these are of importance to me anymore." He turned back, eyes narrowed with either disappointment or anger and went on "I had tried the impposible to save some money for you and get you those clothes so that you can at least feel a little relieved.. that you can smile a little... that you don't look the poverty we are in when you meet your friends who are accustomed to seeing you made-up from head to toe.."   I wearily sit on the old mattress and sighed, "Dad do you really believe I care about it anymore? Please understand that I feared it would come to this when it all began! As long as I attended that group therapy, I prayed for the moment when I was going to be given that medical piece of shit saying I am eligible for SRS... and all that time, I was afraid because I knew that it was going to kill me softly to have all my papers ready at hand but not go through with SRS since we don't have any money! 3 years dad! 3 darn years and I have accumulated all these minuses adding up to the list every single day. When you have 50 minuses, you still can cherish a plus... at 100 it gets harder but still not impossible to beam... Multiply 365 and 3 for God's sake and please see that I have now approximately a thousand minuses in a so-called life! How can you expect me to laugh out loud for a prolonged period of time when you bring along 5 pluses in my life and completely ignore the fact that it only leaves me back with 995 minuses?"   He shook his head a little, "You sure have a unique way of seeing life..." But I very well knew that it was not appreciative by any means. It was also so hard for me to sound all these things but the eerie silence between us have been growing lately. One thing, I admit sadly is that I am very used to it so it doesn't affect me. It only recalls memories of 22 long years when I shared nothing but quarrels or silence with him.   "I see things the way they are, dad. I don't go around seeing a half full glass or a half empty one for that matter. I see a glass that is BOTH half-empty AND half-full. What is easy for someone to believe is that I am darn depressive and all negative! The truth is I am all realistic and my responses are quite coherent if you can comprehend where I'm coming from. I understand every single effort you make to pull our lives back together and I do love you more for it... but I am not going to sit and apologize for something out of my hands, dad. I cannot fake a smile to you, sorry. In this damn life you are the only person I don't hide my feelings from... you are the only person that I don't fake anything... and I wish you could cherish that... and I wish you could see that via my honesty and openness, I still haven't given up trying to establish a bond with you... after all this time."   I fell silent and turned away slightly to hide the tears rising in my eyes. I just did not want to end this conversation with a tide of mutual emotions/compassion caused by my tears. After a moment of complete stillness, I somewhat heard him take a deep breath and approach the door, "After all this time, beautiful..." he stated sternly, "...there is one thing I have not given up trying, either. Hoping... and believing that it will all be allright for both of us one day since we have suffered enough."   As I heard the door closing behind him, the riverlets of tears were running down my cheeks. Burying my sobs in the pillow, I lost all my logical replies... If the simplest of things in life were the priceless ones, the most precious of moments were the speechless.

       :: ALIVE ::   Timeline:  Past (Winter of 1995)   Once the initial prove of the self stage was completed, I was through with the "newbie" status and gained the "talented person" level by the chorists which also labelled me as "approachable". Soon, I was a part of them and my socializing period gained momentum immediately. Not only was I introduced to almost everyone but also ended up hanging out with them more and more. In the meantime, things at The School of Foreign Languages were not too different, either. I soon found out that there were many Literature students at my class and you know how it all happens. You meet one, then comes another and soon you have a huge cycle of friends-to-bes. It was all so surprisingly fast that my musings as to how the hell I was going to fit in had been just two weeks agone, indeed. My department friends were more into Literature thus many joined the Literature Club but most of the times at least a few of them were there to "audience" the chorus rehearsals.   Apart from those introduced, I have to make important personae additions to this timeline. Solara, Blondie and Trendy were three girls who also lived where I did... Soon, we found ourselves getting back home together after the ensemble and eventually got closer and closer. Of the three, Solara was the one who was closest to me for we shared the same pathetic (goofy wit as we called it) sense of humor and the same greed to be captured by the spotlight. She was the "star" of the previous Annual Show of the Music Club which took place at the end of each Academic year. Not only did we share the same wavelength in life but we were also connected in a more spiritual level, sharing the same interests such as spirituality, the paranormal, the unknown, augury and above all Psychology! She was a Psychology major (and a very successful one, that is) which enabled me to broaden my horizons and learn new things about the human behavioral patterns and defense mechanisms (to name a few of a huge list) from her. The four of us gossipped our brains out on the way back home but when it was just Solara and I, it was a seemingly neverending chatter from one subject to another naturally (with loads of laughter included).   Avarel also lived in the same district so sometimes he gave us a lift and I soon realized the girls (alongside everyone else in the chorus) felt respect towards him caused by his distant and charming Scorpio (oh you bet!) personality. All had dreams about being the lead vocal of one song or another and many girls tried an undergoing foreplay covered by a so-called friendship. I soon realized that it was impossible to form a bond with Avarel at that point and they were trying in vain. He always let people close until he felt the distance was enough. One could never step through those walls for the walls were too high and the gates were always closed. Well, to his benefit, girls love that.. It is always mistaken for a mysterious attire and a sense of treasure hidden in the fortress... Thus, they instinctively race to be the one to unearth that treasure hence prove themselves that they are the one for the guy. Sadly, it is one in a million that there is a treasure. Mostly the walls are built to protect a fragile personality who had been hurt once (not necessarily romantically) and cannot be strong enough to either heal completely or face another wound.   A number of friends and a popularity I had never experienced before was not the only thing that was new to me. The passage of a realm I had never totally caught a grasp of was also open. The night life of Ponderland! I was out every other night and there was always a new bar, a new club a new pub to be discovered. It was a way of living that was so alien to me but the more I found myself in it the more I loved it. I felt as if after all this time, I was finally alive and out of the distinct boundaries of my anonymity within the district I lived and the loneliness of my room. I was discovering a brand new face of my personality... A partier, a fun lover (and fun shaper) and someone who was always on the run from one spot to another. It fit and felt so well that it actually surprised me because I had always considered myself a loner who needed to feel connected to the world but was more content when by herself.   Then again, there was I, surrounded by these peoples who, regardless of their differences, shared a common link; a love of music. So, we carried music and our beat wherever we went...   ...while the show kept going on and on...

       :: HEAR HERE ::  Timeline:  Present  "Why is it that every time we meet I find myself underslept, wavering between a cup of tea and a bottle of foundation?" I murmured as I laid my umbrella on the elegant table alongside my bag.  Angel leaned over and hugged me while she chimed, "Simply because you cost me at least 15 minutes on-hold and 2 ciggies chain-smoked." I sat across her, shrugged my leather demi saison off me and sighed, "Not this time. You're early."  "Right and quite shockingly, you're not as late."  Would Ms. Mars like something? (where to begin?) Capuccino, please. "So how are the destiny's darlings doing?" I asked turning back to Angel. This Australian siren who is married to a Ponderguy and I were close friends for almost 2 years now. I can probably come up with a few chucklable definitions that might summarize our friendship but I just won't.   Angel raised an eyebrow, "Is that a new attribute?"  "Quite. Now, shoot me with all those brand new opportunities showering you and your husband's way." Hands gesticulated in the air swiftly, I added, "I'm on anti-depressants, quite high and feeling very empathetic."  "Right. I see you're fine", she sipped her filtered coffee and flipped a blonde lock over her shoulder.  "That I am, although you have to reform the dictionary meaning of fine in my case." This statement was followed by Angel's soliloque on textile industry which lasted for about an hour. Eventually, she asked, "What about you?" to which came my reply; an hour's monologue about the life of a girl who has no life.  "Well, this is like a curse skipping mercilessly from one generation to another. From my father's aunt to my father and finally to me. Now the thing is...." Finishing my second capuccino, I lit a cigarette, "...I will most probably get out of this and as long as I don't have kids, it'll be alright. If I do, poverty will hit back around 50, my lovely, mid-life-crisis-stricken husband will ditch me for a 20 something blonde, no pun intended, and my kids will have to drop their dreams to work their asses off for us to make ends meet."  Angel wiped away a tear of laughter, "You have a Fate to look forward to..."  "Sounds very realistic from this altitude.", I grinned.  Later, while the doctor easily thrusted something the size of my little finger in my ear and dazed me with the holding capacity of aural cavities, I found myself, rather ironically, musing how much of this curse story I actually believed. The doctor hmmed. I blinked. She moved on to my left ear and repeated the check. I fathom I don't believe it wholehartedly (at least not just yet) but somehow it sure makes sense in a phantasm. She hmmed again and pressed her hands to the sides of my neck.  "Gulp please." Obeying, my thoughts finally shifted towards what-if vexations. What if I had malfunctioning thyroid glands? What if I had a clot somewhere located between the ear and wherever in the brain the sound is decoded? What if.... "Thank you, sweetheart." she said and got up, "Well nothing wrong with your ears or your throat." She added a, "On the outside, of course".  "Meaning I shouldn't rejoice just yet?"  "I want you to have an X-ray of your fistula along with an audiogram and tympanogram." she scribbled something on a piece of paper and handed it out to me, "Take this to the Red Cross and they will aid you. Come back with the results tomorrow."  Getting up, I nodded, "Thank you very much."  "Give your dad my regards." As she accompanied me to the door she added, "Are you a ballerina?"  "No. Why?"  She smiled softly, "Your posture and the way you wear your hair definitely mark you as one. That and the exceptionally long neck. You resemble your mother, indeed."  Lovely. Another compliment coming from a post-menopausal/andropausal figure is added to my deluge. At least I am attempting to give the praise holders the commemorating credit they deserve for I may not have the luxury to  hear  another one.

       :: NEVERMORE ::  Timeline:  Present  "A pity. It really ran to waste for him."  That disgraceful utterment has been echoing in my ears for the last two hours with the disbelief that I am the object of "relief-in-comparison" for two sickos. That the protagonists of the parody are up to something new and more perturbing. Their creativity is vexing in the sense that whenever I think they cannot come up with something more crackbrained, they so skillfully use each and every cue at hand to spend their fatuous, futureless, hopeless spare time bitching about me. Which one is more shameful, I wonder. That in my absence, I turn to a "him" or that my life is seen as "a waste"? Odd that I don't feel odd. Numb, maybe, a little bit of sensational solidity which will thaw in a few hours. For the minute, though, I can feel the XXY chromosomes in my DNA are tingling as if they emit a chagrined apology.  But my inner voice resounds:   "Easy dear one. It is not your fault. It is nobody's fault. Neither fate's, nor God's if you believe in one. It is not the fault of your parents nor the fault of a luck so hors de combat. It is not the fault of some abysmal hazard that had creeped in the womb you were naively resting in, either.   Self-pity party has been all over.  Do not resist the numbness and numbness will go away. See, it is already ready to depart you. Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale and see that life has been proceeding all along. Inhale, exhale and 2 seconds are off the clock, never to return again. Let them "him" you in private. Alas, aren't you experienced enough?! Haven't others "him"ed you before? Won't there be many to "him" you further? Can the sleek femininity, the head-to-toe passability (did, does, will n)ever change 22 years of malexistence? Let the shallow waters remain shallow and swim away. With each stroke, all will be past. Every "now" is one heartbeat away from "then". Every cause, every effect are doomed to be transient against the neverending ticking.  Let embraces be fake for their fakeness will last no longer than a blink. Yet, you may say, they ache as long as they last? And that pain makes a little part of you fall off, left behind? Remember leaves; the adepts of Fall. Wind is forever there to carry them away. If not, they are destined to be crushed under your feet, anyway. So that Persephone can present herself again along the way.  Hush, no tears! Tears are not to be shed for fears. Fears are to remind you of Love. Since all is either out of fear or love. Choose the former and you shall wither. The latter, though, is a bittersweet melody of the Fates' lyre. Remember, every anger, every bigotry, every sham is caused by fear. Take them as a "call for help", instead. That's what the masters of existence practiced for eons. Understand and let them be. Thus, at least, you will be playing  your  part with dignity.  You see in the universe of the eternal now, all is actually one. Although they have yet chosen to be apart. Still, within every concept of time you have created, your "oneness" has been eternally reminded. No single being escaped the inevitable... and no matter "what" or "where" in this existence they be,   somewhere in the distance the crow caws a Nevermore for everyone."   Oh... huh? Shit! I have a missed call from Angel which practically means "As Nirvana is online, life's on hold!". I'll be meeting her at 10 am in the morning but the unfortunate question is how long will I be standing her up? My awe-inspiring abilities to be late is cherished by her deeply, I know. She even hissed a righteously irritated, "You are the most timeless being I've ever known in my life!" once.   For the curious, "That's the most anticipated consequence of living in a hell without time, love" was the author's response.

       :: THE CRUSH(ED) ::  Timeline:  Past (Fall/Winter of 1996)  While I was packing up to get back to Ponderland and Uni, to say that I was feeling even wearier than I had first arrived at the summer house would not be an understatement. Friendships  can  be consuming at times but how consuming they can get is totally correlated to the degree of selflessness. My drama was too obvious and sickening, "I can't be happy but I can help others be". That's an amazing way of ruminating misery and ending up malnourished by masochism. I totally and ultimately lived for anything but myself. First for my family, then for keeping my society's "normality" rates 0.1% higher by ignoring my birth defect and sacrificed felicity, then for my friends' constant troubles that were spread on a vast palette ranging from ingrown armpit hair to parental huss, from a potentially inseminating precum drop on the pantyhose to maneuvers that will lead into a female's penthouse. Since I was a creature of both worlds (and this truth somehow sensed by everyone but respectfully ignored), I had both boys and girls to deal with. Not to mention the palette at hand was grand! Here was a sexless being befriended and fancied by all yet no single personality stepped forth and cared to ask, "Are you really comfortable in there?".  Why would they? I wouldn't, either if I had someone who was dedicated to rescue me from every single twisted form of late adolescent trauma.  Finishing packing up, I carried my cases and backpack to the car and was ready to leave... not ready to face Gambit pushing the breaks of his car in front of me and, the engine still on, staring at me from the open window of his driver's seat, "Leavin' huh?".  Such questions steal thousands of seconds from life. Like calling someone, your name and number flashing on their mobiles' screen then going, "Hi this is Aura" or opening the door of your house with your key, hands filled with grocery luggage, trying to hold balance as your housemate calls out, "Is that you?". No further sarcasm is necessary but the one that went to Gambit, "Not really. Daily packing exercise. Burns 320 calories."  "Try sex." he snickered, "Burns temperament." followed by a "Have a nice ride back." than drove off.   I certainly didn't have a nice drive back.  Uni was another story. A rather alleviating one. It was the only place where I could disappear in a crowd of self-absorbed youngsters who believed they were better than the rest on an individual level. Multicolored heads' heaven with various piercings glittering in the fall sun. The aforementioned rehearsals of the "professional vocal group" were up and about and I also found myself among the Music Club's board of management as I volunteered during some derisory moment to be the Room Director of a pre-historic ruin that was not in use for years but since the Club was going to offer its members instrumental lessons that semester, was a project at hand since they needed extra space.   When they first unlocked the door, a smell of dust mixed with closeted urine penetrated my nostrils as I faced an irony. The walls dangerously looked like they would crumble at the slightest touch, there was an off-key piano in some corner and chairs that appeared to have had their share of violence were scattered here and there. I was expected to create a near miracle. Being patted on the back, I stood there transfixed. Oh and before they forgot, could I have the place disinfected since there were reports of the room being flea infested? Mwah! I was a darling! With that, I was left alone.  It was during a meeting of the board when I first saw Magna. So this was how (the) "shit happened". Palpitations that are only suitable for the strong-hearted, sweat marks emerging underarms -heaven help if the victim is deodorant disabled-, making an ass of yourself at every opportunity and want to scream out loud afterwards, "I REALLY AM NOT THIS CRAP, I SWEAR!". Looking at him, there was a slight pause in time when all the cerebral action halted, caused by the sudden overlaod in the circuits which couldn't process such a sight overfavored by the powers that be immediately. Once the time unfreezed, I was stricken by multidimensional worries like, hair, weight, a pimple in the butt, mouth hygiene, family background and current GPA.  It all lasted for slightly longer than a second, of course. Then came the recollection that I was a freak of nature anyway, a girl who had to act a sexless boy out and could never ever come near the hypothetical, possibly blonde, siren he was currently bedding. No need to describe a spectral moment further. Suffice to say, I secretly fancied, then seriously fancied and finally fell head over heels for him which lasted for about.. say...a semester and a half.  I never claimed I was an utterly devoted fantasian, did I?    Conclusion:   Years afterwards, all water under the bridge, during a truth-or-dare session at Charon's, I was asked whether I ever had a love so platonic or not. The aforementioned siren of Magna had actually turned out to be an adorable red-head named Sonic and a very close friend of ours. She was also present at the time and my imprudence I failed to assume as straightforwardness made me spill this story... All I can say is, I prefer some of my friends sober.

       :: BLACK INCUBUS ::  Timeline:  Present  As long as the door of my Cocoon is slam shut against his unendurable, glottal dissonance occurring through the delta sleep, I don't mind my uncle's sadistic stertor symphony that adorn our nights (and most of our mornings). A consequence of chain-smoking for more than 30 years, his intestines must have already lost the plot yet I wonder how the hell they haven't pulled a strike together by far and decided to suffocate him to end both their misery and save our stratosphere! No matter how familiar I may be with this torture, there are moments when I cannot stand it.  Especially when I'm going through the cycle which resembles the pre-periodic deliriums of natal females. With a perfect timing around the 25th of every month, I am hit by sugar craving, constant babbling, radical tension that is noxious for all beings within the radius of a mile and hot flashes... that sneak into my sleep and are remolded into juicy dreams.   So last night, after I was suddenly predated by a sleep attack, I found myself being penetrated by an incubus in the shape of an African American hunk among a luscious flesh versus flesh rhythm as old as time. I would have interpreted this dream as "Watch out love, you're leaving hormonal leakage behind!" but it wasn't just a dream made up of sizzling sexual indulgence. Towards the finale of what Harlequin Romances would depict as the "seething lust", he leaned over and held my hand then jerked back as if he was electrified. Then, he linked his fingers with mine again, held them tight as he was finished and got up. He hurriedly rushed out and for some absurd reason that is very common in dreams, I heard my aunt's voice outside asking him, "Why you're in a hurry, aren't you?" to which he replied an even absurder, "I have to run out. If I don't, I won't be able to resist falling in love with her". My aunt cackled as a response (bitch!) and I blinked my eyes open while my uncle's overture temporarily ebbed, leaving me awake at 1 am in the morning.  Well well... I couldn't get back to sleep and went on listening to the hurling wind outside, my eyes fixed at the shadowy patterns on the ceiling in the darkness of my Cocoon. When my father found his closet pillaged by my uncle (a sign of his Akineton searching the previous day) in the morning, I nodded dreamily at his breathed swearing while I was having my breakfast. The same reply to his kissing the top of my head compassionately and sarcastically going afterwards, "Heh you're probably going 'Cut the drama' at the moment, right?" while I was plucking my eyebrows (It's nice to have someone in your life who knows you well enough, thus, manages to pursue a conversation that you don't have to actively participate).  When I saw an African American guy (you don't see an African American in Ponderland everyday and if you do, they are usually Nigerians in origin) seating himself at the table across me soon after I ordered my morning espresso at Mrs. Rose's Cafe, I was... Holy filth!  Next time, I'll see to dreaming about a Keanu Reeves look-alike. Who knows?

       :: LOVE AT LAST SIGHT ::  Timeline:  Past  Of all the viscid seed that had perforated my being, Only yours were not debilitative. Dampened by euphoria, I once erred to believe It was enough to reason that your self would linger  On these sheets -our prison for two-, longer.  The once yours, now within me, Never made up for the once mine, Now without you.  ...Deplorably, All that was secured and re- formed, Could not lead to a you re-fined.  s i g h  Practice ephemeral death safe and sound, Next to the exanguine flesh you nourished upon. For I know just afore the dew you left behind, Ultimately expired, You will have tracelessly perished by my side.

       :: SCORPION MATTERS ::  Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1996)    Setting:   The insouciant beach scenery in a Nocturne.     Fixtures:   An almost-full Moon pasted to the night sky leaving a phosphorescent trace that led to a vague horizon far, far away. Waves crash serenely on the beach and from afar two shadows can be seen; One somewhat pacing back and forth, the other looking like a wispy pile on the sand.  The approach towards them begins.   Mumble mumble.. mumble mumble.. mumble mumble screwed.. mumble mumble totally banged.. mumble completely bonked! I raised my head to the overwhelmingly irritated (which was getting irritating) figure of Goddess whom, I thought, was soon to start a journey towards the center of the earth now that the traces of her constant pace started to look like the beginnings of a dike on the sand. She had dragged me out of my family's triplex soon after our arrival to the summer house and embroiled me in this monotonous monologue that had been going on for the last 15 minutes and was made up of the technicolored synonyms and derivatives of the word "fucked". I sighed as silently as I could so as not to sound as if I was getting bored but ennui is the inevitable outcome of a circumstance that seems to process in circles instead of an ascend towards the climax (tell me!).  "Would you relax a little, hun?" I shot, so that she could snap back at me and the subject would at least change. That and at some point, I had to remind her of my presence.  "Relax?  R E L A X !?!?  I mean here I am drowned in self-pity and stuck in a situation beyond me, desperately in need of a close friend who, just in case you need an explanation as to why you are here at this particular moment, is you and you are telling me to cool off! Ever thought of writing an advice column?" Her voice echoed off slowly in the currently solitary beach whose hidden corners were soon to be occupied by girls whispering "Don't..." and guys inherently taking this opposition as an erection signal.  "No. I advice for free. How about telling your mind that takes my remark as 'cut the crap' to back off, sitting down next to me and telling me about what happened?" I tilted my head and even smiled sweetly knowing that although I couldn't see her face, she could see mine.  "Oh well..." she retorted and literally fell down next to me, her chest heaving either from the best of physical exercises, ie. sandwalking, she had been through or from the anxiety that engulfed her. I waited for a moment so that partial calmness is recaptured before clearing my throat.  "So... shall we start from the beginning?"  "I'm screwed.. I'm..."  "Fast forward a little."  "Here I am drowned in self-pity and..."  "Goddess!" An eyebrow raised to intensify the exclamation. Anyone who knew me personally was cognizant of the fact that when an eyebrow was raised, seriousness (or danger) wafted in the air.  "Alright, alright" she raised both hands and ceasefired, "First off, I want you to know that I, now, can understand where you are coming from when Gambit issue is considered." I narrowed my eyes and an "Oh?" escaped my lips while she continued, "It's really impossible to form a healthy relationship when the relationship is surrounded by a myriad of mutual friends and is constantly microscoped."  I nodded and, although why Gambit and I were never a proper "issue" had nothing to do with that (at least, back then), kept my silence. She took a deep breath which, I estimated, marked the end of the introduction and the beginning of the real thing, "I guess I'm in love with Predator".   Predator made up the last corner of the friends-for-life square during our personalized version of Dawson's Creek. Gambit, Goddess, Predator and I formed a subset alongside many others that constituted the actual set named "the gang!". We were about 30 people who grew up together, initially bound by a suburb of Ponderland that was inhabited by summer houses.  I am not an easy person to surprise. I can take in statements like, "Guess what? I had sex with a dolphin last week and am pregnant with the first anthropomorphic being on this planet now!" with a smile and possibly with indifference unless I'm expected to be its godmother. I guess I'm way too much of a Forgiving Humanitarian for my well being. Then again, the fact that I can forgive and empathize someone rarely implies that I hesitate to rebound out-of-date personalities in my life to the waste bin. "Well..." I said, cutting my musing halfway and turning back to the reality, "That's awesome! I always knew that you guys would make a perfect couple. Still, I wonder how your boyfriend will react to that."  Goddess sighed and leaned back, resting on her elbows, her expression coming and going between anxiousness and numbness, "And that's where I need you in."  I mimicked her posture and we sat staring at the sea for a while before I broke the silence, "How close are Ben and Predator?" I asked to save myself some time.  "Very." was the answer, "Through last winter, we formed a tangle. You know, Predator and I as childhood friends, Ben and I as lovers, Predator and Ben as buddies which developed into a team that are glued to each other. The thing is, as we got closer, I realized that I am helplessly drawn to Pre instead of Ben. We have never been this close and boy, Aura, we just make so much sense together it was inevitable!"  "Well then all I can say is..." I bit my lower lip, "...break up with Ben as soon as possible. It's no use to act as if you take him for granted while you actually don't. You can only take someone for granted if you still have a gain."  "Nice words. Now how about filling me in with the appropriate way of wasting a relationship of 3 years?"  Sarcasm, I can relate to. Sarcasm due to hopelessness, I can sympathize. But sarcasm once the eyebrow is raised is pushing luck. "What do you want me to do, Dess? Abracadabra your life? I didn't get myself stuck in manure and from where I'm standing all you have at hand is your honesty to stop the sinking. Take it or leave it!"  "Eat it!" she said but the tone indicated that she was with me and backed off.  "I'm not saying cut the ties with Ben and jump in the sack with Pre that night." Her eyes twinkled so I added, "However tempting that might seem. Then again, although your hormones can invade your reason, I'm sure Pre's won't be effected by them. He is a sealed box that needs too much time to lockpick, go in and re-lock the latch from behind."  She nodded, "He's a total mystery. How much do you know him?"  "No further than he allows me to see. We only had a quarrel once in all these 8 years we have known each other. We've shared a lot of moments, a lot of video games, a lot of movies, a lot of jokes but if you ask me who Pre really is behind the outlook, I'm all blank."  She moaned and raised, sitting cross-legged on the sand. Taking a handful, she let the particles flow between her fingers, "I wish I could sneak into his mind... No not even that! I wish I could just take a peek."  "Sorry but if what you told me about this tangle of yours is on-key then you probably know him better than I do. Then again, I know him to the point that he has his own morals and his heart would lie in dignity. He would never arrive on a trotting horse, withdraw his sword and, armor shining, rescue you from a blinking boyfriend who has no idea what's going on, grab you by the collar, kiss you passionately as the two of you sail off towards the sunset. You have to be careful, sensitive and above all, sensible in this case which means break up with Ben immediately. Cut this meaningless threesome and let the situation fallow."  "Easier to say than do." I sensed the tears in her statement and also raised, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. Alas! We were 19 back then and such crisis were still parts of our late adolescent dramas. We sat there silently, leaning on to each other and on to our mutual trust until couples started passing us by in search of the greatest location for the "deed".    Conclusion:   Goddess didn't break up with Ben neither that summer nor the following year. Thus, I, while still fighting gender dysphoria all by myself and hidden from the light of the world, not only had to put up with her episodic tantrums thanks to Pre's romantic affairs but also the occasional, allusive eye contact with Gambit during those rare moments when his girlfriend was away to shower between shags.

       :: THE REVISIT ::  Timeline:  Present  It all started on Saturday with a shocking bee-beep from my mobile. Why I received an SMS! This was probably the most interesting thing happened to me in the last... say... 3 months. It was unexpected due to the sheer fact that I have nobody left in my life that I could share a mutual, finger-numbing session restricted to character limit. They (they is occupied by three personalities, by the by) simply call me and we confine the session to the credit limit, instead. I pranced towards my bag and hastily pressed a few buttons only to be greeted by a message that went  "Aura?"  from a number that made no sense to me. Biting my lower lip, I sat still, looking blankly at my mobile's screen, trying to figure out to whom this prominent message could belong. I changed my number almost 2 years ago which probably caused the new owner of the number imprecate my being for a while, so that my speeddating past was buried into the dusty pages of my personal history. So this person should have been someone who was not effected by my "Next...?!?" days.  Sighing, I dialed the number back and waited in anticipation for the next party to answer. I was feeling halfway ashamed for completely erasing this possibly-significant-person from my life when a hesitant, boyish voice choked a "Hi?!..?!" into the receiver. I have quite a phonic and visual memory so I realized with dismay who he was and my shame was instantly replaced by feeling ashamed in the first place. It was Miles... someone I contacted and lost contact with totally clad in assuagement after the number change.  "Hello, Miles." I mumbled, my shame for being ashamed in the first place giving way to ruefulness this time. "What was it?"  "Uhm... hi Aura... I got a missed call from someone and I thought it was you so... I.." Sure and I was Marilyn Monroe in my recent past life. "I don't know what made you think out of the blue that it was me, Miles but negative. It wasn't me."  "Oh.. I see... well how are you then?" That really wasn't a very skillful attempt of continuity but I hadn't used up my forbearance just yet.   "I'm alright, Miles. You?" Could that guy passing me by really have those Elizabeth Taylor eyes or were they contacts?  "Fine fine... mmm... yeah." Glad to hear that you are still so exhaustingly monosyllabic at times also.   "Good to hear." He smirked at me and I began to wonder what kind of a guy would wear violet contacts and strut in a way that screeches he believes he is divinely stimulating while others realize at second glance that he stares fake. While I turned away from him, Miles was stuttering, "...to see you again. Are you available today?" in my ear.  Actually I was. Then again, we had the controversial sausages-french fries-beer trio for dinner that evening (a major event that strikes once every two weeks) and I promised my dad to be at the table, sipping my beer ladylike and smiling blandly while being subjected to my uncle's subanthropoidal noises as he feeds upon his meal. "Sorry, Miles. I need to attend to a family gathering today."  "What about tomorrow?" My entire being rioted and held up a banner that went "Life is precious!" then again, something in his voice sounded so sincere, so regretfully naive and undergoing  "I really am not inclined to be a pain in the ass. It's just that I'm a young, innocent being that still has an untouched territory within him not ravished by a female and I need a pro to destroy my feelings so that I can join the horde of glowering, score-oriented men."  that my lips shocked me as they utter a "Sure. Tomorrow will be fine."  With that, I made one person out there happy and turned myself into a ruin. Hanging up, I went back inside Mrs. Rose's cafe and pursed my lips while I toyed with my brownie. Miles, objectively, was a really sweet human being overall when he was not stricken by emotions and dropped to hmms and errs. He was 3 years younger than me and ever since we had first met about 1.5 years ago, the theme was Alanis Morissette's Hands Clean with a stress to the part that goes, "I know you sexualize me like a young thing would and I think I like it". He was the perfect beau for an above average freshman since he was a guy with brains and a matching blase demeanor overall. He was exceptionally thin with narrow shoulders and long limbs that made him seem even taller than his 6'3'' frame. He had this glitter of brilliance buried behind his unsuccessfully put together grunge style and for a girl who still believed she could process a "diamond in the rough", he would be an amazing lover.  For some reason, he decided that I was the embodiment of his ideal female whereas I tried my best to draw the line in between. Still, on a drunken night at Charon's house (on that renown couch of hers that somehow managed to witness almost all our relationships), we snogged and in the early morning, he left for work, skipping merrily while I buried my head under the blanket with an otiose attempt to strangle myself across a belated actualization. All throughout the following few weeks, he was on cloud number nine as we found ourselves in a game of hide-and-seek; He desperately in need of seeing me, I desperately in need of escape. Finally, on a freezing winter night, he caught me while I was having a late night coffee with Goddess and Gambit, totally drunk and high on marihuana and keeping me out in the cold, managed to immobilize my bodily fluids as his bloodshot eyes tried to fix themselves romantically on mine. The last I heard from him was during the New Year's of 2003 when we were having a really cozy gathering at Charon's; a get-together of old friends from Uni. He called and persisted to see me for which he received a perfectly inexorable rejection.  Nodding thankfully at the waitress who approached to get my empty plate and took my green tea order with a nonchalant assent, I linked my fingers and sighed as the countdown to inevitable began. Next day, after having made him stand aimlessly for 15 minutes, I arrived at the meeting spot biting my tongue and repeating myself that I will not say or do anything that will transmogrify me from a sensible, cheerful, fun-to-be-with human being to a shrewd, sarcastic, uncharitable bitch. After all we were simply "friends" who were seeing each other after a long, long year. Once we took a seat at an outdoors cafe nearby, I started recalling the moments when we really had fun together. Meaning, those moments when he didn't try to implement emotions clumsily into the scene. As I said, he is a clever friend whose company I might really enjoy if the foreplay isn't involved.  "So how was life this last year?" he asked after I lit my cigarette with his lighter.  Stonewalling! "Not bad, not bad. I'd had worse. Yours?"  "Same. I was leading an anti-social life if you believe that."   No, I didn't. "Really? How come? Weren't you the first runner up in Mr. Barhopper 2002?"  "Well yeah but things change, you know. I didn't have the energy for that any more. I entered the Uni exams and started all over. Finance, this time."  "Well done. How does it feel to go back?" Instead of forth.  "Lousy. You know all these..." I knew. The conversation just flowed all throughout the day, thankfully without any attempt of drama and I actually even relaxed and enjoyed the rest of the day. On our way back to my apartment he mumbled, "Are you up for a night this week? Since we lead both secluded lives, why not tossing for our antisociality?" I was really planning to accept it if he didn't hit back with, "I mean if you're not very busy with your translations. You know, after all this time, I still wonder how I'd spend a week without seeing you."  He was cute. Really cute. If only seemingly mature guys my age could be as open as he was and he was not as open all the time. It really hurt to retort a, "Like you did for more than a year."  He snickered, "You know, Aura. You may only be receiving complements from guys over 50 but I don't have very high standards and can cope with it."  Laughing, I nodded, "Well the problem was never your standards, dear Miles, but rather mine." With that, we exchanged smiles that read our minds and since we had arrived at our front door, added kisses on the cheeks to that interchange of unspoken sympathy. "Well, see you." he said as I started climbing the stairs. "Right." I answered as I struggled to find my keys, "We'll see."  The door closed behind me and I returned to the familiar silence of the doorway that led to another night alone.

          PHANTASMEMORIA       :: DEAFENED BEAUTY ::    Timeline:  Present  Cupping my cheeks with both hands, my dad posed a proud smile as he looked into my eyes, "You are a very beautiful girl, you know." Taking a step back, he narrowed his eyes and nodded to nail his statement; a vague attempt to shift my mood as the gesture implied that he meant what he had said. I smiled slightly and turned around to keep on stuffing my bag with all the unnecessarities of feminine baggage as if what mattered to me the most at the moment was making sure I had my lip gloss and cleenex with me. Sighing, he turned around and uttered a, "Well I guess you're unaware of that, though." before stepping out and leaving a me with a you-bet expression behind.  Waggling my butt while I pulled my jeans up (a straight-out-of-some-jeans-ad move that always works while dressing up in front of boyfriends), I sighed and picked my bag up before heading out to the kitchen (the only location in the pit we live at that has the best light for make up). My mind was occupied with this ear problem I had been having as of late. I keep having these sudden attacks that makes me feel like my auditory perception is replaced by a vacuum while I keep hearing my voice in my head -- something resembling how one feels when they have water left in their earlobes after swimming. Worse, I also hear my breathing in my head which implements a Darth Vadery background to my daily life:  "Yes ma'am?"  "Marlboro Lights Menthol please. [coo haw -- coo haw -- coo haw] Thanks. Have a nice day." [coo haw -- coo haw]  "Beware the power of the dark side, ma'am."  Taking that problem aside, I asked myself if a daughter can rely upon her father on such compliments anyway After all, it's his casual paternal tripping to see me forever as a youngster (which helps at times when one nears 30) and beautiful. I have concerns about my outlook as much as every female and being the perfectionist I am, unless one day I manage to stop the traffic as I gracefully pass the street, I will never be totally convinced that I am a good looking human being unless after those rare moments when I am pampered by a facial or straight out of the hairdresser or all waxed up and ready to show off those legs with a micro skirt.  Getting out of the flat and entering the ancient elevator (it is so antique that it needs a check up every other week. I assume it is one of the first examples of the modern elevator released in late 60s after those see-through ones with a sliding lattice door; Those that that travel up and down while a marbel staircase spiral around them in some French movie. I'm not certain if this makes sense to Americans, though. I always thought that historically, they jumped straight from westerns' stairs to modern dramas' monochrome elevator doors that slide open after a ding. Possibly my bad), I looked myself in the mirror. Perfect make up yet frizzy hair!  Being endowed with long, naturally straight locks is a gift but having hair that have mood swings totally unmatching mine is not. Some days (the key word is "some" here), they decide that they're in the mood and it's time to rock! I have to emphasize that when they rock, I am rarely on the same wavelength. At others, like this one, I want to look neat for one day after an inane, unkept week but thanks to their  hmphing away, I end up being partially done and the glances from my fellow sex scream, "Cute... If you don't count the hair".  Getting out of the elevator, this was time to check the overall attire. A lycra V-neck bordering somewhere between adequate and sexy with jeans that compliment my slenderness just enough and I am proud to announce as BRAND NEW! (yes my loyal, faded, torn, patched all over jeans are now resting in piece). Moreover, I even managed to purchase brand new boots to go along with them. I am still trying to disregard the fact that summer is around the corner and I will only manage to wear them for a month or so until next Fall. A long, leather jacket that was once made a pass at as "You go Matrix!" finished the touch and now the only thing left was to tie that hair in a knot and I would be o.k.  I was still fighting with a rebellious lock that kept on popping out while footsteps were heard on the stairs. It was the old Mr.Flex known as such because he is a retired calisthenics coach. The once bulging muscles are now replaced by the shrinking flesh of the old age and he falls into the category of "stick figure elders" that kept shriveling down until they walk around dangerously two-dimensional as opposed to the "Humpty Dumpty elders" that grow an age belly from their mid torsos and relatively stoop so that their hip lines merge with their backs. Per usual, he came to a halt on the last step and started staring at me so I had to greet him with a "Hello Mr.Flex".  "Mm.. hello young lady" was the awaited response followed by a smile that said "since you are in this building and casual enough to fight with your hair in the middle of the first floor then I should know you but I so not". I was extremely used to his utterly temporal memory so we went over this every time and could never took a step further than the introduction. Usually, I am an elder's beloved... so as long as they can still spread their World War I reminiscences and/or wear hats with matching gloves. When we first moved in with my Granny, he continuously mistook me for the ex beauty queen living at # 12 whose pre-menopausal craze lead her to wear skin tight tops with stretch jeans. Needless to say I wasn't feeling complimented.  I smiled and took a deep breath to ready myself to the coming. "You are...." he began and my perfect timing took the burden off his slumped shoulders, "...the daughter of Mr. Mars. The great nephew of the woman with the manic depressive son."  The moment of enlightenment struck him with an "Aaahh... how is she doing?"  "She is fine... well... fine as much as she is allowed to be if you know what I mean." All of us are allowed to be, indeed.  He nodded as I finished with my hair that decided to acquiesce to my efforts probably because even they were not wallowing in the moment and wanted to flee atopside their owner. Just when I took a step towards the exit, my ear got me again and the natural sound of my breathing started reverberating in my head.  "Well have a nice day Mr. Flex [coo haw -- coo haw -- coo haw]"  "You too young lady..." he was already wobbling towards the waiting room at the entrance before he stopped and turned to me abruptly with a sparkle in his eyes, "..you know I remember your mother vaguely from her visits to your Granny. She was a very beautiful woman. You must have taken after her." With that he entered the room and disappeared.  Maybe I was a bit overjudgemental towards his deficiency of recollection? Or prejudiced towards this fading man who had just managed to place a surprised smile on my lips? Whatever that was, I certainly could have savored that statement, turning it in my head over the morning to enhance the warmth it brought along if my head wasn't already preoccupied with the sound of my very own self as I spoke and breathed.

       :: A SPIRITUAL OPPORTUNITY - Part Two ::   Timeline:  Present vs. Past (Winter of 1994)   The elderly woman leaned back in her chair, that piercing (not in the disturbing sense but rather extremely effective) smile of hers never leaving her thin lips. Her white hair was pulled back and tied in a knot, her delicate hands kept gesturing swiftly in the air as she went on talking upon the raised podium facing the audience. There were more people present than I had imagined and her capturing aura was so prominent that not a even an occasional cough or alike was heard in the seminar room. The room was a mixture of history and modernity. Just like the building Maharishi Mahesh Transcendental Mediation center was located in. It was a windy winter night accompanied by a light rain and through the ajar window, these ethereal companions sneaked in, causing the white curtains sweep gently across the floor as if they were also curious as to what was going on inside.   "...another important point is that you should be rest assured that what we present here has nothing to do with religion or a set of beliefs that are an alternative to it. TM (the abbreviation for Transcendental Meditation) is just an element added to your ways of living just like adding going to the gym or taking a hobby course to your daily schedules. It is a meditation technique easy to exercise and don't you fear whether or not it will work for you or you can do it. Everyone be it 7 or 77 can learn this method very easily and implement into their lives..."   The seminars lasted for a week. Through Monday to Wednesday were the free sessions where TM was briefly introduced to all those who were willing to learn about it. The seminars after Wednesday, though, were restricted to those who were determined to proceed and were ready to pay the "small" fee   Oh well... The guy who is sitting somewhat across me keeps slurping his tea which is getting more yucky every second. That and his glottal noises screwed my motivation to write. To wrap it up, we went on with the seminars, I turned a meditator after an eccentric personal ritual, my tutor told me that I had great potential and I should consider attending the Sidhi courses before heading off to Maharishi University and awomp bamma looma awomp bam boom! She was extremely supportive and TM made me control my deprivation and get my life back on track much faster than I thought and chang-chang, changadee-chang-chibop.   It is an amazing experience that I recommend to each and everyone. If you seek further information, visit  urlLink Maharishi.org  and shoowop, shoowally, wally, yippity, boom-de-boom.  [*frowns at the guy*]    -----------------------------   Then she completes the cycle, stops repeating the mantra, wakes up refreshed and rama lama lama kadingy, kading-a-dong.   Happy End.

       :: A SPIRITUAL OPPORTUNITY - Part One ::   Timeline:  Present vs. Past (Winter of 1994)   The slim silhouette sitting cross-legged upon the worn mattress sighed softly as she went on journeying in spirals towards the depths of her psyche. The shadows danced in the dim room as a passing car's headlights were reflected on the windows. The smoke of the lavender incense kept filling the air lazily while it fought against the dominating, rusty odor of the dust accuulated in the corners. In her mind's eye her mantra flashed as it was repeated in harmony with her heartbeat, soothing and taking her back and downwards, revealing and releasing the memories in her unconscious hidden from her. Memories that were long forgotten... or so the conscious erred her to believe.   -----------------------------   It was only two weeks since my mother had passed away. The emptiness cancer leaves behind after it traps and kills a loved one is quite bothersome. One goes through the illness on the same wavelength with the person who suffers from it with the difference that one only experiences the mental sphere and not the physical. The patients fight for their lives while the relatives fight for their sanguinity. When the patients fall, the relatives fall too yet they have to stand up immediately and bring their relatives back on their feet. As the illness progresses the patients and relatives get used to acting out a mutual optimism. Both sides keep their positivity in each other's presence yet behind closed doors the decaying process of accepting the possibility of death continues.   Thus, if the patient falls prey to the scythe of an anthropomorphic death, the only thing left for those who are left behind is accepting the absence of their loved once and not their passing away... Since their death has already been accepted if not awaited with a covered sadness.   When I went back to high school after only 2 weeks of my mom's death, I was saddened even more. The thing was I could not stand the silence in the house, could not stand the piercing serenity of being alone this time. Hence, I ran away from that apartment where each corner was ready to shove a tearful memory in my throat. Even worse, I was feeling as if some door back in my mind was shut thus hiding all those merry, delightful moments mother and I had spent together and on this side of the door where I was, flashed only the timespan during which cancer was an issue - All those emotionality we had been through up until her ICU week were as vivid as possible to my dismay.   Thus, I ran back to school, thinking my friends would embrace me, believing they would understand that I could not tolerate this Chinese torture a second longer. I tried my best to be my old self, laughing, singing and joking around. Those who were closest to me, including Sister G., went with the flow yet the rest of the class acted as if I wasn't there at all! Saying I was shocked would be an understatement. People were passing me by as if I wasn't there... and soon I started thinking I was in one of those Hours, 6th Sense-like movies where I was actually nothing but a ghost and was fooling myself that I was for real. Finally, I couldn't cope with it any longer and cornered Bee snapping, "What the hell is wrong with you people? I'm back! I'm here! I'm fighting for normality here and you're acting as if I'm not present!"   Bee hissed back a reply that rings in my ears even today, "You should have been mourning right now! Not behaving as if everything is normal because it is not!" With that she turned around and left, leaving a jaw-dropped me behind.   I ran away from school this time.... and found myself on the bus whose last stop was my parents' ready-to-wear workshop. Arriving there, I blindly took the steps down and entered the building, obviously surprising all the workers within for I rarely dropped by that place. My father was out so I closed the door of the office behind me, separating myself from the outer world and the understanding (mixed with pitying) glances of the workers and threw myself on the comfortable chair where my mother used to sit. Sinking into the chair, I inhaled the mixed scent of mahogany and cloth in the office.   Between the table and the decorative cut glass upon it were pictures of my mother and father - mom with the workers, mom and dad smiling in front of the building with a few co-workers and... a backstabbing moment captured while mother and I were laughing at something, totally unaware of the lens directed towards us.   When the phone rang, tears had been flowing for heaven knows how long. "Hello?" I answered shakily.   "Oh hi dear. This is Mr. Mason, is dad there?"   I covered the receiver with my palm and sneezed before replying, "No, Mr. Mason but he'll be back shortly. Would you like to leave a message or will you call back later?"   "Actually..." he began a little hesitantly, "...I might as well tell you about this, sweetheart. There is this Transcendental Meditation center here in Ponderland that we have an invitation for this week's seminars to. Your dad seems interested but thinks you wouldn't feel aright about it for the minute. Would you like to come along? They start tonight."   Trans.. what? Here I was trying to cope with my life and this guy was talking about a seminar about a hardly pronounceable thing "Actually no, Mr. Mason. I have no interest but I'll ask dad if he wants to come along with you. Anything else? No? Take care."   Hanging up, I leaned over and rest my forehead on the table, totally forgetting about the conversation while doing so. I don't know how I fell asleep there but I jerked with the touch of a hand on my shoulder, "What are you doing here?"   Shaking my head slightly, I rubbed my eyes and got up, "Hello to you, too dad." It was then I realized that he had some business company "Oh sorry.. I didn't mean to disturb you."   A middle-aged woman stepped forth and tried a compassionate smile, "No no you're not disturbing at all, dear." She reached over and held my hands, "How are you?" I released my hands from her grip and frowned, "Fine." I said sternly while it was the quite old man's turn to step in the scene, "We're so sorry to hear about your mom. Our condolences..."   "Yes yes thanks." What was this? A let's-pity-this-17-year-old-who-needs-all-the-love-in-the-world-to-make-it-through party? I looked over my shoulder and muttered, "I'll be in the kitchen, dad." and went out without another word. People around me were either odd or I had lost the plot entirely. They either made me sick with their slimy affection tripping or shunned my efforts to get back on track and ignored me. Actually, I didn't even know which party was worse. Entering the kitchen, I poured myself a cup of tea and was further strangled by the attitude of the workers. Their eyes screamed "we are so sorry" yet they kept trying to make me smile.   It was then I realized that unless I left my life for a while, I could never properly get it over with this temporary eeriness around me. Wherever I went, people were going to kill me slowly with their clumsiness towards afterdeath thus enhancing my deprivation. All of a sudden, I started seeing walls rushing forth and trying to entrap me.. the place seemed smaller than ever... it was now a cell... a prison... faces were coming closer murmuring, "She is dead!"... faces with eyes wide open ... "She's dead!" .... the voices echoed among creaky walls approaching... "So sorry.... so sorry.... so sorry.... sorry.....sorry....."   The next thing I know, I screamed as I rushed into the office panting, sweating and stuttering, "Mr... M-m-ason.. cal-led...say yes... say we'-ll-go" and with that I passed out.   -----------------------------   A deep breath was heard in the room as Night raised Her dark curtain. Her embroidery - the twinkling stars lit the windy, winter sky faintly. The shadows fell upon the closed, flickering eyelids of the girl who was holding a pillow in her lap as she sat cross-legged on the worn mattress. The memories waved in, the incense burned away and her mantra took her further down while a car passing by blew a horn outside.

       :: FIRST AND FOREMOST ::   Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1996)     Summary:  Aura's prep year at Bayside University is over. She attends the Music Club and joins Rock Choir, one of the three polyphonic ensembles the Club offers to its members. After the Choir's annual show at the end of the Spring Semester, the Musical Director Avarel discloses his plans about forming a professional group that will be somewhat the more crowded version of Manhattan Transfer. In the meantime, one of Aura's closest friends, Goddess calls and tells her she needs her desperately.    It was a fine summer afternoon in June when I stepped out of the Music Club and watched people coming in and going out hastily. The auditions for Avarel's group were announced and after seeing our performance, those who were around were quite eager to join. I had just been auditioned myself as a proof that no one was favored and to tell you the truth, I was hating every moment of it. All this effort to make everything according to the book was not my style at all. Soon, Sprinter and Ode joined me outside and as the casual conversation flowed, I found myself craving to get back home and pack for the summer house. It was not because I didn't like Bayside but such was (and still is) my character. I need my space. I have the need to disappear, be on my own for a while, take a deep breath before diving back into the action again.   While I was craving and conversing simultaneously, two girls approached us and joined the talk. I didn't know them though they were no strangers by sight. When you are a regular in an environment made up of closely-connected people nobody is a stranger totally. One of them was the girl that I had met way back during the initial chorist selections of the Music Club. She was the one who kept murmuring "Wind Beneath My Wings" perfectly (she definitely had an amazing voice) while expecting awe from her surroundings (that was the irritating part). She introduced herself as Bunny and her friend as Charon. As far as they told us, they were selected to the Classical Choir and although they were very few in number (when compared to the 40 something members of our Rock Choir), they turned out to be very good friends. She was nice but the other girl, Charon was even nicer. She had this air around her that emmitted wit (and she actually was witty when all those clever jokes she kept hitting were considered - that is the kind of wit I admire, indeed. If one is an expert at witty humor without being sarcastic, he/she wins my first impression over. Goofiness, on the other hand, never does the trick), approachable yet also a million miles out of reach. The second best thing in a person for me after punctual humor is a personality that cannot be read as an open book and keeps you at a distance no matter how much sincerity it reflects. As I said, this is me. I am likewise so I'm drawn to people likewise - a simple formula.   So I started talking to this Charon person and soon we found ourselves planning what to do for the night. While the five of us were going down the slope to take the seaside road to Middlemarch (one of the most popular districts of Ponderland [aliased in this story after one of my favorite books] by the sea and is famous for its history as well as its street cafes and trendy bars), I found out that I found her very easy to talk to. This is the third and final criteria of a fundemental friendship to me. You probably have experienced it, either. Look at those who are closest to you at the moment and try to recollect the first time you have met them. It is most likely you will see that with at least one of them, you have never had problems communicating from the very start. In Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah, Richard Bach presents his readers with some book of sagacity called Illusions within which the protagonist comes across a teaching that goes:     Your friends will know you better in the first minute you meet than your acquaintances will know you in a thousand years."    Charon and I were (are) simply two of countless perfect examples of this "teaching". All throughout that night, I went through those rare moments of life when laughter shared under the carefree effects of alcohol teaches one more than tears. I simply got to know these four people who were going to play a major role in my life in the coming three years more than ever and especially one who, in time, was going to be my female soulmate, my delicious other and best friend for the rest of my life.   When the morning arrived and my Grandmother and I were finishing packing up while waiting for my dad to arrive so that we could get going to the summer house, I was more than glad that my stay in Ponderland was prolonged. Now I was ready to face the question marks I was going to share with Goddess as I looked forward to my Freshman year.

       :: FAKE IT NOT ::   Timeline:  Present Perfect   "First, never hang up on me again!"   "I didn't hang up on you! I was paying for..."   "Second what's this fake ID thing about? What do you think I am? Mafia or something?!"   "But you said..."   "I said we could try applying for a temporary ID not fake, for God's sake! There's a grand difference!"   "Right! Awesome, really! So I'm back where I've started!" [pause] "You know how I feel?! I feel like a wounded animal that attacks those who try to help it because the pain surpasses sense! Now before I start mauling you, leave me alone..."   -----------------------------   "...will you?" I blinked my eyes open to see Mrs. Rose smiling at me right next to my table. The sun hid itself behind a cloud yet the rays were streaking from the clouds, causing intricate patterns all around the sheltered garden as the shadows of the leaves fell upon it. "Excuse me" I said with an embarrassed smile, "Were you saying something?"   "That soup, darling. You won't finish it, will you? It's cold already anyway. Would you like me to get you a new one?"   "Oh no, thank you." I muttered slightly shaking my head. I was so lost in my musings that I forgot about the soup, indeed. She leaned over to take the china bowl away and patted me on the shoulder. "You seem a little worried, Aura. Would you like to talk about it?"   "Oh it's nothing, really."   "Let me know if you like anything else, then." She turned away and was climbing the steps leading into the cafe when I raised my voice which caused her to halt, "You know I may need something, though." Mrs. Rose turned around with her eyebrows raised and that compassionate smile dominating her sincere face, "That Brownie cake with chocolate sauce of yours. That might be just what I need."   She laughed as she disappeared and I sighed deeply. There should have been a way out of this. There was a source of light somewhere and it was patiently waiting for me to find it. Perhaps it was this darkness that my eyes got used to which was making it harder to spot.... Perhaps, when I found it, my eyes would need some time to adjust daylight again. Nevertheless, there was a way. There always was a way that led to a brand new beginning since nothing in life was permanent. No matter how long a situation might have seemed to linger for, it was destined to...   -----------------------------   "...change! You have to realize that this is not the way to deal with problems. You are neither the first nor the last person who is turned down at an Interview!"   "Why can't you just leave me alone so I will simply cool down? The last thing I need is some patronizing!"   "I'm not patronizing you! I'm just showing you that this is something natural. You are disappointed alright. You were expecting this voiceover thing to be an exit out of this place but there'll be other opportunities. There'll be so many opportunities when the time comes that you'll turn back and laugh at these days."   "Fine! I'll laugh when the time comes, then! Now if you please excuse me, I want to concentrate on this minute and the fact that another chance is missed and it's all because of...."   -----------------------------   "...you? God, is that really you, Aura?" I raised my head and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw one of my high school friends smiling at me. Dearest Bee! We were really very close since we went to the same high school, were living at the same neighborhood and our summer houses were at the same district. It had been years since I last saw her, indeed. That last time was my huge (re)Birthday party back at 1999 when all my friends were invited to meet the real me for the first time. We hugged each other tight and I stuttered, "Bee... I... can....cannot believe this! How have you been?"   "Where have you been should be the one." We chuckled as I invited her to sit down with me but she had to go, "I am just going to meet my fiance." she said and my face obviously got the you-gotta-be-kiddin' expression so she smiled and added "Right, I'll be getting married this summer but anyway. I tried to call you dozens of times but your number was unreachable." Obviously, I had changed my mobile number ages ago once my speeddating days were over so we swapped numbers and hugged again, making sure we would meet as soon as possible.   Mrs. Rose was bringing my cake in the meantime and saying, "Ah what a lovely sight, darling. Old friends coming together again. You know what is the best?" She placed the plate on the table and sighed, "The fact that thousands of things change yet some things always remain the same. Memories of good-old times are one of them."   I smiled and nodded, "True. At least those good-old times are always as real as they could get and not..."   -----------------------------   "....fake! I'm your dad! I'm on your side! Don't try to take this out on me!"   "I am not... I.... am I?"   "Come here silly..."   "...I'm sorry.. I just..."   "I know, beautiful. I know."

       :: FAKE IT ::   Timeline:  Present   There had been so much snow to delight me yet it just went so abruptly, it was surprising. A fake spring painted the sky a deep azure and coveys of swallows scattered and united playfully in the air as they passed high above the skyscrapers. Fortunately, white storks have not returned yet. They are believed to be the ones who carry the actual spring benath their wings and are believed to be the initial sign of the rebirth of nature.   "Excuse me!" The smiling blonde (dyed, of course) entered the office that was shoving its modernity in one's face and closed the door behind her. She was wearing a formal, two piece dress as she carried a pile of papers under her arm, "I hope you haven't waited for too long." She sat on a comfortable chair behind a neat office desk and I was certain by the look of it that the ergonomy theme was enhanced by an iMaC standing atop the desk. "Not at all" I replied placing a bright smile on my lips, "I have just arrived myself." which was a complete lie, indeed. I had been killing time around the office for about one and a half hours and had been waiting for her in her office for the last 15 minutes.   "So..." she began, linking her fingers to complete the professional Interviewer imagery, "You are interested in doing voiceovers, I see. Do you have any experience in the field?"   I leaned back and crossed my legs trying to look as comfortable as possible - the only hint of my anxiety were hidden in my dead cold hands, "Actually, no." I said in an overtone, "But we all start somewhere, don't you think?"   She nodded and tilted her head slightly, "Are you coming from an acting background or...?"   "No." I hit back straightforwardly and tried my best to sound as sincere as possible, "But I have sang half-professionally for years so I have fundemental knowledge about articulation. After all it is a vital key when you are recording in a studio."   "Right." she agreed but I could sense from her narrowed eyes and the rather dense tone topping her voice that I had started loosing her, "What about diction courses? Do you have a certificate from one of them?"   "No, I don't." I replied to reflect my truthfulness (silly me). I had decided the previous night that no matter what I encountered the following day, I was going to be as open as possible. "Frankly, I didn't know that it was a prerequisite, either." (Frankly!? God!)   "Actually, it is." she said now seeming utterly relieved since this was going to be the easiest if not shortest interview in her entire career. "What we really look for in a beginner is talent shaped by some degree of dictional education. You see, you are going to be working with many professionals in the field. The majority either have a theatratical background or are experienced with the microphone such as radio djs. Doing voiceovers with them requires at least basic knowledge about timing as well as different types of stresses, pronunciation and dialects..."   I was continiously nodding in the meantime. The chin was up, the smile was still there yet I think it turned to look like a oh-I-feel-like-shit-but-go-on-informing-me-anyway beam. I turned back to reality as she handed a post-it-not to me with numbers on it, "...try them and once you get a certificate, contact me as soon as possible so we'll see what we can do for you. You sure have a melodic, soothing voice." I stood up and shook her hand firmly while I was thinking, 'I'd probably try them if you were dying to sponsor me, love.' She accompanied me to the elevator outside and I thanked her once again before saying a final goodbye.   When the doors closed, I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. So this was it! The story of my post-transitional life that I had been trying to alter. I took my mobile out and dialed my dad's while I was hastily exiting the building, "Hey beautiful!"   "Dad get me that fake ID."   "Why, you were indifferent..."   "I changed my mind. Get it!" I stumbled upon something on the sidewalk and cursed slightly as I tried to reach for the bus stop half running half walking. Darn, the bus was overloaded and passed the stop by.   "How did the interview go?"   "I was turned down gracefully. Anyway, are you or aren't you getting it?"   "Are you serious?" Another bus slowed down and although this wasn't the one I was supposed to take, I got on anyway.   "I've never been more serious." Hanging up, I took out my wallet to pay for the ride. If life was so determined to fake it for me, it was high time I would fake it back!

       :: SCARECROW - Part Two ::   Timeline:  Present Perfect   The strong Boreas was shaking the windows and they were trembling slightly like my insides while my dad was standing amidst the Cocoon, leaning to a chair with one hand and listening to me -- the windows were resisting the penetration of the wind just like I was resisting the penetration of a nervous breakdown, ".. and that is why I feel all by myself.." I went on, "...that is why there is barely anyone left but you who is physically by my side!"   He shook his head slightly and raised a hand to interrupt my monologue, "You have always been by yourself, Aura." he said sternly. There was this serious yet not accusing look in his grey eyes to my surprise, "I don't remember a time when you spent a night with your family. You always had your own sanctuary, your own room whose door was closed to the outer world. I am not just talking about these last 5 years, too." He smiled a little to make sure he was not trying to blame me for acting likewise, "Even before these years, even when your mother was still alive you weren't among us. I cannot recall you, your mother and I spending time together a few days in a row. You always isolated yourself from your family and we accepted you as you are. Still, I have always been by your side physically no matter what. I was simply a door away... just like I am now." He pointed at the shut door to emphasize his simile.   My lips were burning with pain since I had been biting them non stop for the last 15 minutes, "Dad now that my friends are physically apart from me, I have literally nothing more left to give."   "Oh please, beautiful..." He took a step towards the bed I was sitting cross-legged upon and sat next to me, "...you never had anything to give! Can't you see Aura..." he locked his stare to mine until the eye contact started digging the moat circling my defensive fortress, "...you didn't loose anything since you never had anything to loose. What you consider as losses were circumstances that made you stronger. You've never lost a thing, dearest. You've simply changed! You've simply adapted and adjusted. You have simply become more experienced as you have grown to become a more and more beautiful woman in these last five years."   That was it! I could feel him sneaking in through my walls and reaching the little girl inside who was afraid, "Do you..." I was surprised how desperate my voice sounded, "...think that I have been doing nothing, dad?" I gulped down a sob and dig my nails in my palms unconsciously, "Do you think that I abused your understanding?.. that I simply crawled in a corner and hid while you were out there trying your best to fight the consequences of our bankruptcy? Do you think I was being a selfish, useless parasite all this time?" He parted his lips to say something but I raised my voice to halt him, "No please! I need to know and I want you to shove it in my face if that is so. If that is what I have been doing, if that is what I seem when looked from the outside, I want you to slap me and wake me up no matter what!"   He reached over and took my cold hand in his warm palms, "There have been occasions when people told me so, to tell you truth." I felt a dagger's edge thrusting itself into my heart, piercing my feelings once I heard that statement. Finally, I was about to face the worst of my fears. Finally, even my dad was going to say he was fed up with my weaknesses, "And never have I given a damn what one or two says." He stroke my hand softly and once again turned to reach for the little girl within me, "I know you well enough, beautiful and I know why you always have a door shut. You have always had a burden too heavy for your shoulders but you never asked for help for 22 long years. You faced everything by yourself, learned to deal with all your problems by yourself and never knew what it feels like to be aided..."   "Five years ago, Aura, you opened that door for the first time to step outside and come to me. You gave me a chance to help you. You gave me a chance to be a father for the first time.... and I may have failed for these last 5 years but sooner or later, I will overcome our financial obstacles that prevent your belated SRS. You are not sitting idly in a corner while I fight for you, beautiful." His voice softened as he squeezed my hand, "You are just giving me a chance to be your father and yourself a chance to be helped by your father. You are a strong woman who is weak in body and I never thought you have been abusing my good will... If you were ready to face the world and still kept on shivering like you are now....." he leaned over and pulled me towards himself so my head rested on his shoulder while his arms wrapped themselves soothingly around my slim form, "....then I would probably kick you out of your sanctuary and slap you in the face to wake you up... but not now, no."   His words kept ringing in my ears as silence prevailed. They hang in the air before they slowly started sinking in and the girl inside me stopped shivering, her momentary fears slowly escaping her. I closed my eyes, slowly taking in his paternal compassion and for the very first time in my life, I realized that I respected this man beyond words. He may have failed me when love was considered for too long but he never failed me when I was lost in a stormy sea of fears and needed a lighthouse to find my way back towards the shore. "Dad..." I whispered, "You always say that it is not a sin to depend on someone."   He nodded, "It is not. I have always believed so and I always have had someone depending on me. That's just me.. I'm like my mother." Oh my dearest Grandmother... how I knew what he meant by that statement, "I lived for someone else for all my life. Still, I never lived for someone as much as I lived for you, beautiful... not for my parents, not even for your mother."   "Dad can I ask for something?" My palms were sizzling now that I realized I broke the skin with my nails but I ignored it altogether.   "You see? It is not that hard to ask for something." I could hear the contentment in his voice as he kissed the top of my hair and said, "Ask away."   "Please give us a chance after I am ready to face life and when I seem as if I don't have to depend on you any more. Promise me that you will give us a chance to be a daughter and father when the time we are no longer doubling over by the load on our shoulders comes. Don't think you have accomplished your duty in this world and ever think of passing away before we lead the lives of a true father and daughter."   Stroking my hair, he answered softly, "Not a chance, beautiful! Not before this little, shivering duckling I have turns into a beautiful swan and flies by my side to search the horizons."   Tears rose before my closed eyelids as I buried my face to his shoulder. The Boreas retreated and the weather outside started calming down as I formed an image of my father in my soul, thus adding the finishing touches to my scarecrow.

       Timeline:  Present and Past (Winter of 1999)    Attention:  Excess emotionality. Not recommended for people with low EQ levels and/or patience. Be warned and read at your own risk.   With taut hands, with eyes staring blankly at the midst of the table, she slowly, gently, gulped down the rice. The fork leaning on the side of her plate glittered softly; Trying to catch her intention, in a way, urging her to hold it... to pursue her meal. Yet, she was away... So far far away.   "You have had enough, have you not?"   S-stop!  She felt something rising from within. Something evil, something unhealthy, something uninvited... something so familiar from a year ago.  A dire impulse blurring her perception, the trail of her thoughts, her very existence... The desire to throw the plate against the wall and shatter it into hundreds of pieces... maybe breaking an object might break the solid, hidden itch..  Invisible hands grasped her elegant neck alongside pressing thumbs against the dimple on her chin that started to ache. There were tears coming soon... Tears that could not be halted. Tears that could not be withheld... It wasn't tears she was afraid of... It was the awareness that these tears, this time, would be the tears of no return.  She felt eyes on her... Two grey eyes watching her sudden stillness intently. She uttered, "I am fine, dad."  Her voice came out crippled, torn... yet, perfectly in control. The myriad of emotions was not hidden in her soft, feminine voice but it sounded determined... As always.  She heard her parent say something.. His voice was overcome by the sneaking voice within.   "There you go... Here I am, again. You could not deny yourself from me for long, could you, lovedy?"   I denied myself from you ages ago. You are way too late.   "Did you, really?"   The clasp on her neck tightened. She found herself parting her thin, fragile lips so as to continue breathing easily. She did not surrender... Her hands were shaking slightly yet she took the fork back in her thin fingers, found her way towards her lips and managed another mouthful of rice rotate in her mouth.   "Well well, lovedy. You are fighting, in vain. Why the fighting, anyway? Can't you see how easy it is to take a little step sideways? Can't you see how everything will come to an end smoothly if you let one foot slip from that thin rope you have been walking on?"   Shut up!   "No more pain, lovedy. No more tolerating poverty. No more waiting meaninglessly for that day of salvation. No more living in an asylum. No more deprivation. No more having to divert your eyes from couples in love. No more mornings reached through long, cold, lonely nights...."   She gulped down and cleared her throat. The meal was almost over. The old lady who was sitting with them at the table got up. Leaving her and the grey-haired man against each other. His eyes imprisoned her expressionless face. She seemed to be chewing her meal yet her eyes were so dull, so fixed on one spot of the table. She seemed to be afraid of letting that spot go.  As if that spot was aiding her greatly in her silent war. As if that was a tiny particle of reality she was clinging to with all her might.   "...No more the seclusion. No more playing possum. No more watching dreams pass you by, one by one. No more being late for life. No more bills to be paid while striving to make ends meet. No more stained sheets and tattered pillows. The dirt of ages will be no more..."   Shut up!  "I am fine, dad. I am fine..." she muttered. He questioned her. She didn't hear the question as she got up with weakened knees. She could feel it...   ...Her predator... coming for her... again!   She floundered to her Cocoon with eyes not seeing... she found her way solely relying on her instincts... she found her way through years of traveling the same, solemn course back and forth... she reached her bag as her breathing got heavier... She, then, realized that she could not see due to tears blurring her vision. As she reached forth, they spilled.  ...Spills of her very own being...    Once more, she was sacrificing her precious water in her pain desert.   Trembling hands found the pills... clumsily, she took out one... dropped it... took another out... no two out... she swallowed them dry. The hands on her neck strangled her. The voice in her head started resounding... Resounding across a possible defeat now that she received a chemical back up in the war.   "...no more the hermit life due to shortage of money! No more sacrificing a single thing because you have to pay the water bill at the end of the month! No more seclusion! No more ideals, plans ruined! No more heartbreak! The fact that you are like an infant presented with her favorite doll but not allowed to play with it no more!..."   "I am fine..." she whispered continuously "I'm fine. I'm fine! I'm fine!" She reached for the window and opened it. The view of spring sea from beneath the two skyscrapers welcomed her versus the budding trees winking with every careless leaf move and scolding her decay while they regenerate. A breeze ran to her aid, filled her nostrils, she choked helplessly to inhale it. She longed for arms. Arms that would hold her that instant. A chest she could bury her face in. A loving embrace that would sponge her state.  "Mother.." she mused, "Grandmother... Lovers who claimed you'd be there for me forever! Where are you?... Where are you  now ?" The tears dangled on her long, dark eyelashes yet did not fall. She was not permitting them to flow. The inner pressure of suppressing was breaking her apart but she did not give in...  ...and her predator knew her way too well so as not to be fooled by her longing.   "No more the lost childhood, younghood! No more keeping your chin up because you  have to ! No more facing a foggy tomorrow! No more soothing your potential that is craving to reach forth! No more having the reserve of a delirious passion! No more countless talents being left to rot in a corner! No more waking up in the middle of the night, panting, clad in sweat and tracing wet locks off your face! No more need! No more want! No more genetic defects! No more being the object of a sentence whose subject is death! No more the necessity of surgery! Being a mutant is no more!"   The ache of her chin was causing little sparkles flying freely across her vision! Her lips mimicked a silent scream... A cry that would probably tear the afternoon sky if the strangling hands let her neck go! She leaned against the window pane, rested her forehead against it, closed her eyes and blindly snatched the knob of the open window.  The time stood still!   "...no more being broken! No more having been born defeated! No more being a Desert(ed) Rose!"   She felt an easiness tracing up her spine and the back of her neck where the fine hairs disappeared into her dark brown locks. The chemicals were finally pushing the enemy away... the predator tried his best shot as his voice weakened:    "NO MORE ME!"    Slowly the hands on her neck let her go, she coughed softly a few times to control her breathing. She sniffed back the traces of tears and took a deep breath as if she needed to make herself sure that she could take a deep breath again!  She was still standing there when she heard his voice softly said, "Aura?"  "I'm fine, dad.", she replied. The voice was weary alright but this time determination was the upper tone.  "What was it?" he pressed further.  "Peekaboo of the end", she said, still slightly trembling but regaining her control by the minute.  He seemed thoughtful. He seemed to suppress his paternal instinct which forced him to hold her in his arms that instant. However, he seemed as if he was also aware of the fact that they had such moments way too much in these years. That another one meant little if not nothing. The embrace of the father and the daughter had been loosing its effect; Crushed by his failure to give her daughter her life back. Like her uncle, she had broken her wings years ago and depended on her father. Who else could she depend on? She was young, still innocent and full of hope towards a sparkling future. Her father told her that he would be there for her. Her father... The man she was inherently coded to believe in the most. Her father who told her that it was their ignorance towards her illness.. her intersexuality.. and now it was his responsibility to be in charge.  "Your progesterone levels as well as your estradiol levels are way too high for a male" the famous endocronologist said to a vulnerable youngster sitting with her father across him... 5 years ago..."Since you are not using hormones by any means that leads us to the conclusion that the XX side of your genes have naturally overcome the XY side of your biology." He eyed the youngster who seemed as if the Professor was talking about a miracle. "This explains your basic breast formation, your unaltered voice, your delicate frame and your overall androgyny. However, I will be honest with you two".   The two  held hands firmly across him.  "Unfortunately this brings too much stress to your body... Hence, the bleeding you have been suffering as of late. High prolactin levels are effecting your kidneys negatively, it seems. Your female hormones are high but not high enough. Likewise, your male hormones are low but not low enough. There are patients living with Kleinefelter syndrome perfectly but in your case it seems you have to choose one way or another since your body actually isn't fond of the androgyny." He chuckled the last sentence...  ...but  the two  were not laughing!  He cleared his throat and went back to his monologue, "But of course, I need to further consult with a colleague.... and more tests..... and to be sure.....", it went on.  They left there dazzled... He quickly came to his senses, though. He would support her treatment... he would support the surgery that would fix her... the surgery that would harmonize the body with the biology her system had chosen to lean towards according to the tests...  She broke those wings without a second thought, then. Her father... the stranger of 22 years transformed into a hero overnight...  And she believed with all her heart that her hero would teach her to fly again. (Just like her uncle had believed her mother.)  But, he had failed her!  (Yet, she failed him)  And he had imprisoned her to himself.  (And she imprisoned him to herself.)   Heavens! He didn't want it to be this way!  (Alas, she wanted it to be exactly, this way!)   Nevertheless, did that make any difference on the outcome?   It was only a week after her diagnosis. He arrived one night at their apartment. His mother was preparing the dinner table while she was helping her. He watched her merriness. Merriness like he had not witnessed in her before. He walked inside the kitchen not knowing what to say or how to begin. His mother urged him to hurry. She smiled with her angelic eyes to her son... but then the smile froze. She knew something was wrong. It didn't take too long for the merriness to surrender against the heavy air.  "Dad what is it?", she asked. His eyes were distant, though. He pulled a chair... Threw himself weakly on it under the frownlight of his mother and soon-to-be daughter. "This is it..." he said weakly.  "What is it?" his mother asked...  "We've lost it all, ma.", he uttered trying to sound reasonable, "I cannot fight with the avalanche of debts any longer. I'm closing the workshop. We are bankrupt."  For an instant nobody dared to speak... his statement hang in the air untouched... unreplied...not dared to be responded, in fact. Finally his daughter-to-be said, "But dad... how is that possible?"  "Your mom's treatment put a lot of strain on our finances... and we never really managed to leave it behind, afterwards." He sighed. 4 eyes were staring at him blinking rapidly as if this was some joke, "I tried my best to cover the expenses but the income of the workshop does not balance the outcome any longer..." He stopped to take a sip of water from his glass. It didn't do any good to his dry throat, "...add the the crisis of the ready-to-wear sector nationwide and we couldn't face the full blow."  "How much in depth are we?" asked his mother.  He didn't answer that question instantly. He couldn't...He desperately tried to find a way to ease it. Yet, he gave up eventually, "A lot. We need to sell the workshop and all the machines in it. Also... we need to sell the summer house and the car, too."  "Dad..." she gasped, "...but... but that's  all  we have!"  "All we had.", he corrected. Then he readied to fill them in with the worst, "And we have to move out of here. You know we have not been paying the rent for sometime and we cannot afford it any longer. The owner sues us.", he let an envelope fall on the beautifully designed dinner table.  It rested blindfully white among the shade of the vase full of fresh flowers.  "But what are we gonna do now? Where are we gonna go?", his daughter-to-be asked, clad in her grandmother's embrace.  "We can go to my sister's", Grandmother said finally, "They have been inviting us to stay with them, anyway. Just temporarily. Until you take a hold on the matter and the crisis is over... until our debts are paid. Then we will think about a permanent solution with the money we have left."  He nodded slightly...Almost apologetically. They approached him and pulled their chairs close. The three of them sat together, going through the longest and darkest night of their lives. Hand in hand... supporting each other like a real family for the first time in their history.   .........5 years ago........   5 years later, though... Everything they hoped... Everything they believed in seemed to be about to crumble. 5 years after that night, they were faced with so many casualties along the fight. Including the angelic Grandmother... Including friends that used to be there on their side through good... But the times were changed now. And people were so absorbed in their own well-beings that they only pitied those in bad times.  ...and unfortunately they almost always took the easiest path. They abandoned.  Thus, what had seemed temporary was resting as fearfully permanent as possible inside this room, on this fading afternoon.  So he said, "I guess you will have a cigarette now"  She replied faintly, "I guess, I will."  She sat on the edge of the bed and crossed her legs. She was that graceful and aloof creature, again, he thought. A phenomena as he expressed once while watching her transitioning into a woman with elf-like features. As she lit her cigarette and let the smoke out skillfully against the fading light streaming in from the curtains, he turned outside. Slipping his hands in his pockets, he started watching the scenery which had just witnessed her daughter's reclaimed victory. The smoke passed him by and drifted away.  "How do you feel?", he asked.  "I'm fine, dad" she replied. "I'm fine..."  "What was it like?" he demanded, not turning towards her.  "It was like the last time... I mean like last year..." she said, letting out another smoky exhale, "But I know if I let it happen again, it will be the end of me."  "No..." he said, this time turning to her.  "I fight so that it will not happen again. It won't happen again!" she repeated, through narrowed eyes that did not meet his.  "I understand.", he said sternly. She doubted it. He didn't, though. "It is cold in here, beautiful."  "I will wrap my shawl around me." was her response.  "Why don't you come inside? Watch TV? Make a change?"  "That..." she said through the thin smoke rising from her cigarette, held elegantly between those thin pointing and middle fingers, "...is not a change."  "I don't like it a bit. Your staying in this room all by yourself."  "Much better than being subjected to a possible delirium by my uncle. More than once I found myself coming back to this room to escape his manic attack while I was watching TV." She took another breath from her cigarette before she concluded through her exhale, "I don't need tens of similar situations to learn a bitter lesson."  "I just thought..." he replied, "...that you might want to watch this sit-com."  "I'm fine, dad." she said with a touch of anger giving the softness of her voice an edge. "I'm an adept of entertaining myself. I will...", her gaze scanned the dirty, gloomy, dark green curtains, "...sing.... or... read..." It was then a tear escaped and found its way. It was a healthy tear, this time... a tear needed...  ...to wash away the anguish of necessity.... of casting aside her innate ability to come up with at least a dozen things she could do out on a Thursday night under "normal" circumstances.  "Come inside, beautiful. I'm afraid of your loosing the plot." he said with a futile attempt to reach out to his daughter. His daughter...   ...who was sitting a foot away and seemed light-years away from him.  Her "I will not" was soft, fragile, weary and aghastly blase... as if "loosing the plot" made no difference even if she had just "conquered" the plot. He watched her pulling herself on the bed, drawing her shawl  over her long legs, leaning against her pillow and murmuring, "I will meditate now."  With that he, silently left the room with fallen shoulders. With that, she closed her exhausted eyes.  Hysteria the Predator was defeated....  And she was once again fine against the world...   ...with  F eelings  I nside  N ot  E xpressed.

       Timeline:  Present    THE STORY    Juclecia's true story starts with Estell, her mother. While known as the second wife to Clive Reopold Re Ecritian, she secretly works as a spy for Vermilion (Vermillions are made up of survivors of a defeated country, namely Krois. Kroisian are usually slaves leading a miserable life and this touches off the tight organization of Vermillion. Also named as the anti-imperialists, during this timespan they are led by Unbeter, yet in the coming days, he is to be replaced by Tristan and Ferenan).  Estell still has a good heart and her involvement with the terrorist group is done in good intentions for her home country. Estell even becomes an adoptive mother-figure to a lost boy named Tristan.   Tristan gets separated from his parents when the Kingdom of Krois is destroyed by the Emperor Clive (Juclecia's father). His mother (Ladrinne Morei Rune Sirat) escapes back to Sirat thinking her husband and child died, and it's unknown what happens to his father. Young Tristan somehow ends up in the garden at Ecritian Palace and meets Estell, who reveals her true, loveable tomboy personality when with him. For a short and peaceful time, Juclecia and Tristan plays with Estell in the old garden. This gets Tristan out of the long depression of loosing his family and home.   One day during a private meeting at the Holy Land (in the destroyed Krois Kingdom) Estell is murdered by the leader of Vermilion, Unbeter. Unbeter of Krois has had growing suspicions of her and believes she has breached his trust. Tristan who is hiding nearby, sees what happened. Horrified, he comes out of hiding and calles Estell's name, and, in doing so, gets noticed by Unbeter. Frantic, Tristan stabs the surprised Unbeter with a short sword. As Unbeter dies, he realizes it was his own son, Tristan. Tristan begins to remember the man's face as he passes away, and ends up irreversibly shocked because he has just murdered his own father.   Unbeter's memory is then transferred into an object he had (known as an Emblem, an Emblem takes many forms, and, in the story, you see it as Calintz' necklace as well as Juclecia's held adorment), which then transferrs into Tristan. Young Tristan's persona becomes foggy, in the confusion he runs away from the scene, and then passes out. Helios Ryuad Rune Sirat (The King of Sirat and Tristan's real grandfather on his mother's side) who witnesses the incident, takes him under his wing, and raises him as his own son. Helios has a liking towards Tristan's amazing sword skills and wants him to succeed him as King of Sirat.   Helios also has Tristan renamed to Calintz.   This Calintz has memories of a happy childhood with a woman called Estell, and he believes a man named Tristan killed his father and Estell. He also does not know who his real mother is. Ladrinne, who would normally succeed the throne also does not like the idea of someone else succeeding (she also doesn't know who Calintz really is).   Soon after news of Estell's death has spread, young Juclecia is exiled from Shudelmir Kingdom (the central and most powerful kingdom of the Empire), and died. Willight Riziem Ernst, a man seeking ways to gain power quickly and who knew about Juclecia, decides to bring her back to life, in a way. He creates a fake Imperial Princess using his own Emblem and the body of a girl, Adora. Using this power, Willight erases Adora's memories and then transferres Juclecia's memories and appearance into Adora. He, then, raises and educates her in the ways of politics and arts, recreating the real Juclecia.   However, the original Adora still exists, just barely. Every now and then Juclecia actually reverts to Adora, and back again. During the game Juclecia makes her return to Shudelmir, as does Calintz. Calintz is ordered by Helios to escort Juclecia safely, and after much confusion (Rose, one of the assassins in Calintz' 7th Squad, impersonating Juclecia under Tristan's orders to have her killed and infiltrate Shudelmir) she arrives. From there the story goes on, Juclecia meeting Empress Leona, Shurenlord (her brother) and the rest of the story's key characters. Every now and then Adora appears and suspicions of her and Juclecia being false arise.   Willight's plan seems to come together, but Gilbert Ropponso Descralda who also is aware of Emblems and their power (since he, too, has been seeking power since Unbeter's death, he really is Jade and used one to become Gilbert) finds out. He finds Willight's Emblem and destroys it, which also destroys (the unreal) Juclecia forever.   This leaves Adora lost and trying to find out who she truly is.   Also, the Emblem sometimes has a mind of its own. When Adora first meets Calintz, she receives Estell's memory from Calintz' Emblem. She also instantly befriends Calintz in the same bittersweet way Estell did with young Tristan. When she first meets him, she even tries to get Calintz to "remember her". Adora isn't only driven by Estell's memories, but she really loves Calintz in a different way. When real Adora starts to come back, and during her search for self identity, she and Calintz fall in love. Calintz also always notices that she resembles Estell, which makes him love her even more.   The Emblem's effect on Calintz slowly makes his real personality and appearance change permanently into the evil persona created inside him, Tristan. This is the same Tristan in Vermilion who has been working against the party throughout the whole game. In the end, the party fights Tristan and Adora destroys The Emblem to save Calintz' real persona.   However, she also knows that by doing this, she disappears forever..     The reason the horizon shines Is that somewhere it's hiding you. The reason I long for the many lights Is that you are there in one of them. So, I set out, with a slice of bread, A knife, a lamp, stuffed in a bag.    Father left me his burning desire. Mother gave me her eyes. The earth turns, hiding you. Shining eyes, twinkling lights. The earth turns, carrying you, Carrying us both who'll surely meet...

       Timeline:  Present      STARRING:      Aura  as   Princess Juclecia Sebine Re Elcritian     Once a favored daughter of the former Emperor Clive, the nobles soon found out that she would be the next Empress and started to flatter. But one day her mother was murdered by unknown assassin and buried where nobody ever knew. Suddenly the Emperor Claive confined her to southern region of Elder saying that she should receive medical treatment.  Everyone was suspicious about the sudden change of Emperor's attitude, but with the news of pregnancy of Empress Leona, Juclecia couldn't be remembered long.  Juclecia has lived a common life in Elder with dim memory of the past. But she hears about the truth of her mother's murder by Marhakatte Orakhan Willight. And soon she loses her smile and promises her revenge against the Empress and those who supported the Empress.  After her brother, the new Emperor Shulenlord finally gave her the permission to return to the Palace, everyone knew her revenge against the people who looked on her mother's death would take away many people's lives.    Charon  as   Ruchielu Chelsea Descralda     She is the younger sister of Gilbert, who is the commander of Schwartz Strum. Most people think that she would be one of the nobles holding great power, but actually she is a common girl and adopted by Gilbert because she was proficient in magic. When she first went into the 2nd squad, she had to tolerate the sarcasm. But now she is in the high rank no one can sneeze at and her miserable past made her mature and realistic.  She usually shouts and laughs at older people, so some say she is pretentious, but this imposing attitude comes from her past experience. Ruchielu is the name she received after she was adopted to the Deskralda family but she prefers 'Chelsea'.    Rain Man  as   Ferenan     Ferenan is the leader of Vermillion. He is more known as 'Mephistopheles'. As his devilish nickname tells, he attempts brutal terror against the Emperor. His parents were fallen Kroisians. It is no wonder not to remember the details of the nation that has been destroyed before his birth. However he has inherited hate against Emperor from his parents who belonged to Vermillion.  Most Kroisian were slaves and even if some win their freedom, it is hard to get the better treatment. It was common for them to be homeless and wonder around. Ferenan witnessed such situation with his own eyes from the childhood, so swore revenge. Although he always keeps cool like the former boss of Vermillion, many members feel constraint in his presence due to his stubbornness and strictness.  By the way, Ferenan became confused due to Tristan who has appeared all of sudden recently. Because Tristan has tried to break down the existing frame that Ferenan has built up so far. However, Tristan also aims at the goal Vermillion wants to reach in the end. What is more, as he was so similar to ex-boss of Vermillion whom he has admired, Ferenan was awkward to trust him more or not..    C.E. (via E-mail)  as   Calintz Jerevinan     In Sirat, he is usually known as 'the Phantom of Avalanche'. In the battle with the strange monsters at the snow-covered mountains of Sirat, he solely killed numerous monsters. Seeing him charging toward the monsters with a sword would remind others of a great avalanche.  He soon became the commander of the Royal Guards. Though he suffered from lots of antipathy in most of the nobles, no one can ignore his ability.   They knew that the name 'the Phantom of Avalanche' wasn't just for showing. Once he became the adopted son of the King Helios, Ladrinne who wanted to make her son accede to the King became to hate him. Though anyone knew this was the exact reason or there were other reasons, but finally Calintz had got to leave for Shudelmir.  As a favored son of Helios, he was a man of courtesy and composure. But his past wound made him close his mind. But he becomes to change through lots of experience as a leader of the 7th squad.    Darrell  as   Joker     He, who is oddly dressed like his nickname, was famous to everybody as the leader of Scaramouch. Known that he comes from the slums, he was badly antipathetic toward the nobles. People say that he came to Schwarz under a certain secret contract by taking advantage of his weak points..  The one who doesn't see the scenery that he flourishes the huge scythe shall not realize the dreadful horror. Different from a cunning nickname, Joker, the huge scythe reminding of a Demon's weapon simply sweeps away all the things around. Camouflaging himself by joking humorously In ordinary times, he has strong leadership and capability as could be called a hero among Scaramouch.   -----------------------------   Want to join Phantasmemoria's Magna Carta Theme?

       Timeline:  Present   (God)Dess:  Bitch!  Aura:  Cunt!  Dess:  Oh how I missed you!   Pre(dator):  So you tell me you're...  Aura:  ...27, completely off-the track and excruciatingly single.  Dess:  Single my...   Dess:  And what does your doctor say about this?  Aura:  He looks at me with concerned eyes that hide the drooling statement, "For the last 3 years I have been dying to cast my hands on your uncharted body parts while you're completely unconscious."  Pre:  You're sick. [chuckles]  Aura:  Realistic, even.   Dess:  What do you think?  Aura:  I don't.  Dess:  Back to the point, please?  Aura:  You guys are in a clover field, walking hand-in-hand towards a sickeningly happy future.  Pre:  You see a clover field in a tea reading?  Aura:  Sure!  Dess:  She even mentioned wastelands, once, if you buy that.  Aura:  At least I don't confuse a clover in the field with a spermazoid in the womb. Now wouldn't that prediction have scared the hell out of you! [grins]   Dess:  And what did the fortune-teller tell you? Hell, I've been asking too many questions for my own good.  Aura:  Yeah, we've come to love you for that. She said she has been extremely sorry for what I have been going through. I found myself soothing her in the end, rather than she coming up with a few lies to soothe me.  Pre:  Oh that sounds familiar.  Aura:  What?  Pre:  Finding you role-reversed.  Aura:  No big deal. The right dosage of hormones does the trick.   Aura:  Wait! Where're we going? I thought Gambit was living only half an hour away.  Pre:  Wrong, love.. He endures the pain of living in the middle of nowhere for the bliss of living in a triplex.  Dess:  Don't worry about him, though. We'll rape you first.  Aura:  Like I would mind.  Pre:  Now that's our kindda girl.   Aura:  I'm nauseaous, I'm cold and I'm hungry.  Gambit:  Then vomit and warm up in my embrace as you prepare yourself a french toast.  Aura:  In your dreams!  Gambit:  Hey hey! Let's not go into my dreams!   Aura:  Since when does this man play the guitar?  Dess:  He's come a long way in your absence, dear.   Aura:  Now what?  Gambit:  What what? Can't I have a word with you in private?  Aura:  The last time you did that I found myself pouting for the next ...say... 2 years.  Gambit:  [smirks] Was it that bad?   Gambit:  ...and you're telling me I shouldn't feel sorry about this?  Aura:  Hell no, Gambit! Feel sorry about this all you want. Pity turns me on!  Gambit:  Does that mean you're staying over tonight?   Aura:  I'm not buying that shit anymore!  Gambit:  Go ahead! You play hide and seek until you get disgusted because you step onto some horse manure and quit in the middle of the game. What you don't get, babe, is that this is all about shit! If you can't endure the filth, don't go for it!  Aura:  What the hell do you think I have been doing for the last 2 years?  Gambit:  Putting up with all the shit about life but not love!  Aura:  Who do you think you are to patronize my life!?  Gambit:  Someone who has known you for 15 goddamn years!  Aura:  If only I knew that you think so highly of those years before.  Gambit:  The years were turd alright because I spend more than half of them without...  Aura:  Don't!!  Gambit:  It was you who always quoted "what is past is prologue".  Aura:  Right but it didn't help Shakespeare any good in his deathbed, did it?   Aura:  Finished?  Gambit:  ......  Aura:  Now we're going downstairs to pretend this conversation went totally suited to two mature adults.  Gambit:  We better wait until  they're  finished.  Aura:  Oh darn!   Aura:  We saw this girl with the most humongous of boobs, today.  Gambit:  ....  Aura:  I mean she was not really proportionate, if you know what I mean. They looked very much like implants in that sense.  Gambit:  ....  Aura:  She probably rests her tits on the table in the evenings and goes, "Gee my globes are tired!"  Gambit:  ....  Aura:  How long does this guy last dammit? [checks the clock]  Gambit:  Mmm...  Aura:  Will you turn that TV off?  Gambit:  You turn down, you turn off, what's next in line?  Aura:  How about a  turn away from ?  Gambit:  Tell me something new.   Granny:  Why you look so beautiful and refreshed tonight, dearie.  Aura:  Thank you, Granny.  Dad:  [raises an eyebrow]  Aura:  Thanks to cosmetics, dad!  Dad:  I didn't say anything.   Dad:  Hey keep singing, beautiful. I missed my daughter's voice, it seems.  Aura:  Did you have to come up with something positive about my singing when I'm suffering from a hangover?  Dad:  Why yes. That way, you can't take it too serious.

       Timeline:  Present Perfect  Friends, Romans, Countrymen lend me your eyes,  One thing that makes Phantasmemoria (and made The Eyes of Aura Mars; The prologue of this journal) a distinctive experience, is the fact that although it continiously brings along an emotional burden during the process of re-disclosing all about myself and what I have been going through, there have been so many people out there who have actually understood the idea behind it.  This is why I am still here.  My humble thanks to all those who have reached me personally and let me know that you truly get a hold of my satire and all there is behind it...  ...which is persistance against the catastrophic knots of life that immobilize us. If you raise your head, you shall see that there are dark clouds hovering above Phantasmemoria Plaza. True, that I have been subjected to more misfortune than your avarage misfortunate (and you haven't even read about it all yet, believe me). Still, I have my claws thrusted in the core of life more than the merriest being alive.  I still recall that summer night when I stood on the roof under a full moon, my cheeks stained with the traces of tears while I hissed towards the skies, "Bring it on, whatever you are!", I said, "Show me what you got! I am more arrogant and more stubborn than you can ever imagine! Do you think I cannot stand on my feet across the flood caused by yourself when you had shattered my safe and seemingly sound dam years ago? Do you really err to think I will let go after all these years of putting up with gender dysphoria, then killing 22 years right in front of everyone and starting off from scratch? Do you seriously think poverty, heartbreak, life break, self break and all that you keep shoving in my face will end up in failure on my part? Are you that misled to keep challanging my strength with the misperception that there will come a time I will take a step back and let go? Do you really believe I will fall apart before I experience a deep sigh of relief?"  There was silence as an answer.  "If you really believe that this story will cease without a happy ending then dream on!" I retorted, "Each time I will cry I will smile afterwards, each time you make me fall, I will get up, each time you cause a deeper wound, I will first aid myself more skillfully, each time you weaken me, I will come out stronger. Even if worse than worse comes alive, even if I find myself on streets, homeless, helpless, I will survive somehow!"  The silence grew.  "I will not throw in before I experience the real me inside out! I will not give in before I look through the eyes of someone content, someone in love, someone mature and above all, someone healthy! I will not let go before I sip that cup of tea sitting across my dad... that sip him and I have been imagining all through the way.. that sip in that tea garden we visit during the summer nights so as to escape the asylum we live in even for a few hours... that sip followed by a sigh and a statement which will go, "Why it was a long fight, wasn't it? But we survived it all!"  The silence was deafening!  "And I dare you, whatever you are..." I concluded, "...because it will be  you  who will give up in the end, not I! Now, come what may!"  This is all there is behind Phantasmemoria ladies and gentlemen.   This is the real face of life!  This is publicizing the pain for all there are to see and in doing so, ridiculing Fate itself. Because Fate still tries yet still cannot defeat! This is taking challenging Fate one step further on my part as I go, "Let's see how well you can torment when you are  outed. "  On the other hand, if Phantasmemoria serves a purpose, if there is even one person out there who can read my lines-in-between and realize that the greatest calamity in life is taking yourself and all that you have for granted, if even one person out there can take a second look at their lives through witnessing  my life  and start cherishing even the most "unworthy" things they have are, in fact, their most precious belongings, then it has been and will be worth the pain of transparency on my part.  Believe me, there is simply no guarantee as to what you are and what you have today will be with you tomorrow. Thus, embrace yourself and  all  you have with  love  in the eternal now...  ...while you still have the chance!  Although, I do my best to reply every one of you, personally, there are times I fail to do so. Nevertheless, you all have my gratitude, you all have my best wishes and positive thoughts for being here with me. You are making this what it is and, alas, I  do  love to hear from you!  As I said once in a poem, we can never own loneliness since loneliness is a free spirit.   And thanks to all those who are astute enough to  understand , I am never alone...  ...and no matter which corner of the globe we may be in, we are never strangers.  All my best, A.

       Timeline:  Present  ~...thought that I would like a  urlLink song  of the unearthly fake Britney Spears and have it circle my hours on a mental level as it kept replaying in a peripheral corner of my psyche? It is highly likely that  urlLink this  is one of the elements that contributes to the visual sympathy but it still cannot solely explicate the melodic disposition.  ~... imagined that my dad would ask me "Are you irritated by my presence?" and I would backstab him with an affirmative icepick that formed itself via a bitter "I am"?  ~... thought that after 2.5 years, I would run into the daughter of the owner of the aforementioned beauty center I worked at and would spend the entire day with her as if we had never fell apart? 6 years younger than me, she always clinged on me like a younger sister would to her elder back then and when she told me the events that unfolded during my absence, I felt something tearing my chest open and grasping my heart as if to give it an open-heart massage. Mutually possessing the miseries of the "only child"ren who are forced to carry burdens too heavy for their shoulders, we quenched our thirst for being understood with each other until the farewells were exchanged, both of us aware that that until next time  was unbeknownst to both of us.  ~... imagined that Neale Donald Walsch is scheduled to visit Ponderland on June the 2nd and when I disclosed this news to Solara, who had introduced me to his spirituality, with zeal, she would reply me with two insouciant statements that successfully (if not righteously) aroused the touchy bitch within me?  ~... thought that my Granny would drastically climax the tragedy level of the early morning through hysterically screaming at the top of her lungs that she was paralyzed? That she was doomed... that she would commit suicide rather living like a plant... Having been exposed to her continuous claiming that the paralysis knocked her off her feet during the first of her hundred daily visits to the bathroom, I am left with a broken palm skin as I digged my nails in them to maintain my self-control and hinder myself from yelling, "How did you manage to take your paralyzed self to the bathroom at first place, woman?!? Why are you doing this to us?! Why are you doing this to  me !!??" The ridiculous play shattered the tranquility of pre-dawn and went on all throughout morning.  ~... imagined that I would find myself lost in 19th century London once again, wearing "a simple bonnet in pale grey and a loose woolen dress in the same color, a lace fichu lying over" my "shoulders and tied in a knot over" my "bosom" while filling the shoes of Maria Clementi, a mute opera singer, this time? The fog-clad streets and the loom wafting in the Winter air outside complementing my miserable efforts to be able to speak again as the  urlLink Frankenstein's Bride , I listened to the wind outside and thought that it was an ironically fitting story for stardom that will only be gained within and witnessed by the bereavement of my Cocoon.  ~... thought that I would realize that everyone was nothing without those little "push"es from life, one day? Although one is responsible for setting all the necessary efforts (as if they are finding the missing pieces of a puzzle and placing them correctly) that will lead them towards a goal, a goal almost always seems to be achieved thanks to a little push kicked by luck/fate/God/the powers that be or whatever one wishes to name.  ~... imagined that as soon as I stepped out, the long-awaited April rain would  finally  welcome me?... and that for the very first time, not giving a damn to how it would seem, I stood under it, my face raised towards the darkened sky and let the raindrops wash away the imbroglio between the Fates and I as I undid my drenched hair so that it fell tangled all over my face. Having made certain that no charted territory of my skin was left unrained, I went back inside trembling as I changed. I knew that no towel could dry the wetness or warm the afterchill.      ~... thought that one  could  tell the tears from the rain?

What about a verbal streptease? Being conceptually nude! Words naked press harder than bare bodies.  How about  genuine  instead of  echt , for a start? A flood, a flux of spelling mistakes? How about not seeing everything for once, Having vacuity in the neighborhood..?!  Being enmeshed in perplexity cuts both ways...  ...Calendar turns to the Day of the Night!

You have one chance to pick the 2 of Cups*, I am already prisoned au naturel in that of 5*.   Join the ride or stay behind And replay "the neverending story" with me. Bury your un-less in the dew of some flesh Flesh is aplenty; it is the all-else drought,   tolight.    aim a bow for the gryphon; or catch him if you can; Save us from the Minor Arcana* Towards the Lovers* of the World*.   n e v e r   t h e   l e s s ... ...with all the masquerade around your words; Layer after layer of sharpened silk they wear, You cannot expect me to fall for your vegetarian life When I'm led by a carnivorous fate!  ...that and you know better than limiting my protein intake to your semen!      Glossary  :  * Gryphon:  One of the mythical creatures illustrated on the Wheel of Fortune belonging to Major Arcana (see: Minor Arcana below). The Wheel of Fortune is the card of the consequences of Fate. The upswing of the Wheel takes us towards a knowledge or life through which we can grow and mature whereas the downswing points to helplessness against the twists of Fate. The Gryphon in the poem is the mystified chance given to the hero to make his decision and act accordingly. He may either "catch" the Gryphon and soar higher to rescue the damsel in distress in an upswing or kill him with his bow and remain ignorant towards their downswing.  * Death:  In the classic Rider-Waite Tarot, Death is depicted riding a white horse with the gates of Jerusalem in the background.  * 9 of Swords:  A vision of impending doom which may not be the reality. The card of sleepless nights.  * 2 of Cups:  The card of loving encounter. Friendship, partnership, reconciliation of opposites.  * that of 5 (of Cups):  The card of sorrow, melancholy and distress; Used in the poem with a reference to the saying "the damsel in distress".  * Minor Arcana:  Minor Arcana is the mother of contemporary playing cards. Swords, Cups, Clubs and Pentacles of Tarot gave way to Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds, respectively. All the cards implemented in the poem up to this point are from the  Minor  Arcana and the rescue is implied to be towards the  Major  Arcana (The Lovers and the World are two Major Arcana cards) which is a term to describe the 21 prophetically pictorial cards of the Tarot as they symbolize the  journey of the hero  starting off with the Fool and ending up with the World.  * The Lovers:  The card of a relationship or love affair with a trial or choice involved. It indicates a great experience in love, yet also presents us with the perception that this step is connected with a necessary decision: the renunciation of the previous framework of life (the parental home, the bachelor existence, the many flirtations) and the clear avowal of one love. Only this step will lead to the overwhelming experience shown by the Lovers. This card therefore used to be called "The Decision." It can also indicate necessary decisions that have little or nothing to do with love. In such cases, it means that we must decide with our whole heart, without rancor, and without keeping an escape route open. Which of the two themes this card emphasizes can only be determined according to the background of the question asked. In any case, it means the great unconditional "yes."  * The World:  The card of the realization of a prize or goal; success; triumph; achievement. The World shows the unity or paradise that has been regained, the experience of greatest harmony, and the joyful conclusion of a development. Putting the beauty of this card into words means risking the danger of describing a mawkishly happy ending.  (My hearty thanks to  urlLink mysticgames.com  for their detailed analysis of the Tarot deck which complemented my years of practicing the art swiftly and enabled the composition of this piece as the first of a set of heavily riddled Tarot poems)

        EPISODE IV: Heaven out of Hell     Timeline:  Past (Winter of 1999)  My junior year at Uni found me emaciated.   The afflictive, painful studio recordings were all through the summer and left Charon and I literally cut loose from Ichoir mentally. We were through with Avarel and his exaggerated self-indulgence alongside his keeping the majority of Ichoir  on his side , turning those that came to be our mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, lovers and friends into total strangers. One by one, they left the neutral grounds for the enemy's side which was agonizing to experience beyond description.  The main reason for all this was simply the clash of Titans. Charon and I are beings who are not afraid of being simply ourselves even if that means the rest of the world will turn their backs on us. We voiced our opinions freely and without self-restraint only for the betterment of the album and Ichoir in general yet Avarel persisted in taking this as an insult on his creative abilities.  Then came the psychological torture. More than once I found myself in the studio, trying to suppress tears as I was trying to make a very difficult partition come out smoothly yet was slowly being strangled by the attack of dead glances behind that glass staring at me without the slightest attempt of empathy but full of mockery if not apathy.  You give two and a half years to become  us  only to witness its collapse into "me" and "you".  Resembling too much like a break-up, does it not? A twist that was marking the end of our polyamory too soon. In a marriage, couples strive to put up with each other thinking about their children, in vain. In our case, our child was our music.  Hence, Charon and I (later joined by Rain Man) tried our best to tolerate the rest. Coming this far, it was no time to quit. We had to take the responsibility of those two and a half years. To make sure that all that effort did not go to waste. If only we knew it was needless because the effort was going to end up wasted by no other than Avarel, very soon.  And if only I knew that all that I was trying to keep to myself for 22 years was going to be shoved into my face before dropping in the heart of public.  What was weakening me was not only this psycotorture but also my very own biology.  As soon as the album went into editing towards Fall, I found myself bleeding continuously.   Literally.  Physically.  I would find my underwear a sight fitting a scene right out of some cheesy vampire movie possibly titled "Bloodbath". Each urinary session turned out to be a pain, I was constantly suffering from a high fever and it came to such a point that I found myself striving for consciousness during the day. One day my advisor called for me and sounded her serious concern about my well-being. Not only physically but psychologically, too. She stated that I looked like a lotuseater, constantly dazed as if I was on drugs. Whatever happened to the bright child of the department who ended up as their only Freshman to be in the list of Honors? Was I on chemicals? Heroin? If so, she would do her best to aid me. What was it?  I left her sitting there puzzled and went home wherein the air was as heavy as possible. Something was happening but I was too weak to get a hold on the matter. Finally, I got an appointment from a urologist and was diagnosed with acute urinary infection. I was immediately on heavy antibiotics to stop the inflammation. By this time, I was already zombie-like, walking around with deep hollows under my eyes and weighing only 104 lbs in 5' 9'' of height thus accelerating gossips among friends in my department.  "Blumia! I once saw him in the lavatory, retching like hell." "Oh no anorexia for certain. He refuses to eat." "No no...Drug addiction. The inevitable result of being entrapped in the night life."  It was none. Just as my family was about to be involved in the craze and start to speculate, a call from the doctor altered the pace.  My prolactin (the hormone that stimulates milk production during pregnancy) levels were dangerously high for a male and I had to go through another set of tests. They must be reduced for high levels of prolactin was one of the main reasons that triggered kidney cancer and since I had cancer in my family history, immediate precaution was necessary.  Weeks and weeks passed me by under fluorescent bulbs, among test tubes, between "pg/ml"s. I was experiencing something so compact that I could not stand seeing another nurse or hear another doctor diagnosing me. Eventually, my father realized the all-importance of the matter and turned towards me.  It was a little 22 years late, though.  I will not be as bold as to stand up and say "I don't trust in anyone who works in an environment that needs antiseptics" but it is close. Very close. I saw doctors misdiagnose my mother THRICE which led to mistreatment which led to her death.  And now I was next in line for their trial and error.  Until, another twist changed it all.  I was so fed up with it all and convinced the end was near for me that I went, "I won't die without coming out!"   ...and I did...   ...with the worst of timings, per usual.

       Timeline:  Past  From   "Conversations with Self" Part III     ...   "What would be the sexiest thing a man could do for you?"  "Ah... well... that's a hard one."  "Get those creative juices flowing."  "Something too utopian."  "Try me."  "His being full of mystifications about our relationship and his feelings, I bet."  "Hmm.. I'm not with you. Explain."  "As in... little concepts that mean so much?"  "Can you picture a scene, for example?"  "I slowly unbutton his shirt halfway, trace a hand on his chest. As we kiss, I pull the shirt over his shoulders. I open my eyes only to find my name or something only meaningful to us tattooed on his shoulder."  "Oh... but wouldn't a man find that a little too permanent? Too risky?"  "I can only find a man who is romantically creative irresistible, indeed. A man who would not be afraid of permanency. And with permanency we're not necessarily talking about the marriage vows. As for the marriage & tattoos part, though, there was this ring I designed when we were back at High School. It was a simple ring with a rectangular opening on the front with tiny diamonds etched around. The thing was that the opening would reveal the tattooed name on the wedding finger, the ring and design complementing each other. We had a thousand variations of that one."  "Really?"  "We kept drawing initials, names, come what may on our wedding fingers as a tribute to that idea for a while. Then Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee ruined it all."  "I bet. What else?"  "I was once nicknamed  Swan  by an ex, for instance. One day, he came to meet me with a shirt written swan in Chinese on the front, right where his heart was. He had it printed on his shirt. He'd wear that one day in day out. You see... plain yet very meaningful. I am a woman who likes to wear a wrist strap belonging to her lover and finds it sexier than her cleavage." [laughs]  "So you're into details a lot?"  "Very much so."  "Any physical stereotypes for this mystical romantic?"  "Hmm... I guess I'm drawn to the cliche: tall, dark and handsome."  "So no blondes for this girl."  "I can't say that, no. It's just that when I'm in a social environment I initially count the dark heads, instinctively." [shrugs]  "Have you ever had a crush on a celebrity as a teenager?"  "Mmm.. not really. Although as a kid I was totally into Christopher Reeve. Oh but there's a point you might find interesting."  "Go for it."  "I used to have a tendency to spot names in movies, that noone has heard about, whose looks I found more striking than your average, people-magazine's-most-beautiful celebrity."  "Can you name a few?"  "Oh let me see.... there is this movie which hurts horribly. A parody in its entirety. It's called "Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me" starring a guy named Max Parrish alongside Sean Young and one of the Arquette females. I could only tolerate the torture until the end, thanks to him. Honestly, there was quite a bit of fantasy centered around him afterwards. Hmm... He's the only name I can get, really. It's been a while, you know. Like, 10 years."  "Good memory."  "Forced satire."  "Anyway, is there..."   ...

       Timeline:  Present Participle  I have reached the fourth Episode of my life which will be titled   Heaven Out Of Hell   wherein the events surrounding diagnosis with radically-harmony-shattering Kleinefelter Syndrome will be depicted but...  ...the "but" holds a myriad of elaborate locks, indeed. The keys I set aside have been cauterizing like mithril to an elf. My fingers feel rooted, my mind opposes revisiting those traumatic moments that still emit an antiseptic odor and a color almost always coming from a fluorescent bulb vividly whenever I'm struck by a variant of them in a dream or remembrance session. After 5 years, it is still not easier to sit down and talk/write about something that has changed my entire life and belief systems drastically.  I can get as dry as I might when describing my gloomy present or the glam past under the spotlights, on the stage, in one club or social scene after another which, overall, was a timeline that passed in an epicurean flash. Nevertheless, when 1999 and 2000 are considered, as I form a link back to those days  when it all began , there is plainly no way of taking a side road and spectate it all through the greenest of binoculars.  There is this saying of a gay poet pseudonymed Alexander the Small down here in Ponderland that I admire. It can be translated something like:  "Don't you attempt to sue me, reader,   When what you read strikes you with an irritating blow; For I've put up with that blow all my life."  If I were to make an entree to the following episode, it would probably be a little self-criticism covering those years when I was a part of Ichoir.  It is dazzling when one has their personal share from  fame  no matter how little or great it is. Being up there trapped in the stare of your alibis who witness and give credit to your talent or simply your presence, applaud you with esteem and scream out your name is so uniquely interpersonal an experience that for those who are not bewitched by the stage spell, it might very well sound inane.  My self-awareness degree has always been very high and I know that for me, singing and being a part of the stage or in front of the camera were never due to one form of narcissm or another. It was something rooted much deeper, a la the craving to be appreciated, to be welcomed, to be confirmed and to be accepted via a genuine part of myself.  In this case, it was nothing but my voice. My range that could travel down to the seductive, luscious depths of the alto (note that alto is not only the lowest range of females but also refers to the voices of pre-adolescent boys) to the striking, purely effective heights of the soprano.  Indeed, my unaltered voice was the only attribute I had for 22 years that resounded my reality.  Thus, unconsciously, I was truly content and in tune with the person I was, only when I was singing.  And I could only felt being loved when I was on stage, experiencing the euphoria of the applause or the encore. Even though those moments were too temporal, although it was nothing but fooling myself since nobody was "loving" anyone and it was just the context that suited the moment, I needed them desperately.  When you have to grow up too soon, when you attempt to hide your instincts from all the world with the viscid, implemented fear of being rejected, when all that you connect, be them your family, your friends or simply acquaintances like the guy in that newspaper stand around the corner, only know and/or love someone you are, in fact, not, when you are never a child nor an adolescent but a gender dysphoric adult for as long as you remember, then you can never get enough of love. No single or multiple phase of love is decent enough.  You indubitably crave for more.  I am grateful for those two and a half years during which I experienced many forms of idolatry and the first two years right afterwards as I experienced the feminine, nurturing heights of love via being loved/admired by men.  The  love profusion , made up of a cyclorama in slow-motion, contributed so much to the person I am today as it enabled me to surpass that helpless need I had had previously.  This takes me back to the "but" at the very beginning. I am inclined to give it a go yet something blocks me these days so I keep postponing it. Maybe it is because of the  Mercury Retrogade  we have been going through? Astronomically (and Astrologically, in return), up until April 30th, Mercury will be going backwards from our point of view on Earth. Nowadays, I don't check my Inbox but Bulk instead. That is how I was informed about this period thanks to that erratic moment when I created an account at  urlLink Tarot.com .  They advise that during this period you should  "just chill out. Slow down. Lower your demands on reality. Use this time instead to revisit and reflect on things you thought were completed. And take yourself lightly. Mercury is a bit of a trickster, but if you play along with his antics rather than resisting, you'll get a fresh view of things and perhaps notice opportunities you might have missed before."   Hence, I blame my constant postponing of the next episode not on my lack of spartanism but the hottest planet (Think twice before you assume I'm being the smartass of Astronomy, here. Have you ever been loved by a Gemini? No? It figures) in our solar system, instead.  Cheers to that!

       Timeline:  Present  MORNING SOMA (Authentic drink)    Ingredients:   One cup of CBC and ESR results. One sick simper. One bright smile. Some patronization (sifted).    Start by mixing the CBC (hemogram: Detailed cell analysis of the blood) and ESR (erythrocite sedimentation rate: Testing the amount of time it takes for the red cells in the sample sink by chemically hindering the blood from clotting) results that came out alright. Pour the mixture into the blender.  In the meantime rinse, disinfect if possible, thoroughly the  sex agenarian looser (who mistook me for a lingerie-genious hot number and asked me with a drooling, toothless smile "What is a bra fastener called? There's this woman in the chatroom who have been asking me that.") in a seperate bowl before you thrust the bowl in the deep freeze and forget about it.  Flake my meeting the violonist (in person, finally. He was so unlike the image in my  urlLink dream sequence  but much better, rather for he is a lovely elder who thanked me with a tremendously open smile and courteous nod that brightened up the dark, rain-charged skies) and add it into the blender.   Finally, add some quarrel with the father figure (who is wearing his bossy, you-under-my-care-you-do-what-I-say-me-Tarzan-you-Cheetah loin cloth these days that drives the very-27-years-old-woman-in-me nuts) in the blender. Mix until it gains a foul, florescent color and/or your finger is sour.  Garbage dispose cold!

       Timeline:  Present  I was halfway into translating a 6-lines-long sentence when my mobile began a monophonic Badinerie. The last syllables of a thought-filled "24/7 hot water available in our suits made up of...." mumble merged into a "Hello?" before Angel's merry voice warbled in my ear, "Hey there! Quickly...your coordinates and your mood."  ...elegantly crafted mahogany sofas following a 19th century romantic pattern..."A little southish from hell's Catastrophe Hall, second door on the left. You can't miss. It's written "Pinhead Only" on it."  "Heh. Listen, Sal is here..." yadayada... Who was Sal? What was I to do with her being here? And why was it that these people were describing their hotel rooms as a "perfect escapade towards history" when they had a water bed disguised as a Louis XIV mattress and had a jacuzzi in a Victorian bathtub? "...so can you come?"  ...which was... hmm this was to be translated as opening into a shaded terrace, yes?   "Yes?"  Oh darn!  "I mean... I was thinking out loud and..."  "Great! We'll be at the cafe. I'll ring you when we get there. Hurry up we only have half an hour or so. I'll take them to the airport afterwards. Bye!"  A curse accompanying the mandatory check:   A broken nail (inexcusable). Messy hair (inexcusable) but at least clean and shiny (recoverable). Shabby jeans (tolerable if they were paired with a tank top). But they were not (inexcusable)! Shabby black top with a low V (so-so) and flared sleeves (passable). Stilettos (posture bonus).  Overall: 2 out of 5, ie. Failed!  Angel has this zeal of introducing me to each and every Australian friend who visits her here in Ponderland. Thus, a handful of Australians think I am someone who can speak proper English, who is very handy during interracial weddings and crisis situations. Lucky me! Walking backwards, I dragged my unwillingness to the Cafe and found myself in the grasp of Mrs. Rose, "Welcome sweetheart! Long time no see! Your friends are in the garden." Kisses kisses and more kisses.   Love spread all over me, I went into the bathroom and started combing my hair while my mind was still somewhere between ceiling-to-floor silk curtains and golden taps with matching lavatory bowls. When I turned back to the moment, I was left with an inevitably aching scalp. Making a face, I sprayed an adequate amount of Burberry Classic inside the elbows and behind the ears.  There... I was ready to face all there was blonde in the world.  Tummy in, breasts up, hips out and the catwalk began. Climbing down the stairs elegantly, I spotted three (three?) heads shining under the spring sun and contrasting all shades of brunettes scattered in the garden. "Hey hey..."  Angel got up and we performed the usual oh-how-we-love-each-other routine made up of a tight hug, kisses planted on both cheeks, taking a step back and looking at each other with sparkling eyes before moving on to the introductory stage. Sal is a cutie. According to Angel, she is an outed stupid. If you ask me, she is naive in a funny way. Anyone who looks at a bag full of herbal tea and goes "Oh this looks like a bag full of herbal tea" is naive in a funny way in my book.   The other blonde head, though.  ...now that is another story. This head did not only look as if he was crafted by an artist but also had one of the most perfect profiles I had ever seen in my mundane life. A pointed yet masculine nose, full lips, hazel eyes that were being constantly narrowed by the sun and a chiseled jaw. All of this was placed on a strong neck, broad shoulders, a sun-kissed tan intensified by a white shirt, light hairs slightly visible on the forearms and an overall fitness emitted from approximately 6 feet of height.  Men like these turn me into Sil in Species who is out in search for the flawless male to copulate with while oozing estrogenic fluids.  Not because they are only good-looking, no! But because I was later informed that he followed Sal to England, leaving everything in Australia behind to give a chance for his relationship to flourish. Now this is the determination I was talking about earlier. The courage in a man that I appreciate...  ...and such courage is so rare a find (especially in such a good looking form) that it is worth admiration. Nevertheless, they are never single. So the fluids are halted midway, the line is drawn after the initial, impulsive reaction subsides, a friendly, safe smile is placed on the lips and the background theme that goes,     "...Stranger you look so different Some other thoughts fill up my mind And you just made it happen Got me thinking of you in my life..."  *    fades out.  After an enjoyable 30 minutes, I wished them both good luck, went back to my translation while they headed for the airport. I was to meet Angel in a few hours and we were going to have a "roof session" so I didn't have enough time to finish the translation. Hell with it! I was distracted, anyway.  "The roof" is the terrace of the apartment I live in. During summer, it is my favorite spot due to its extremely beautiful sea view and of course its breezy atmosphere which is a getaway from the sticky, humid heat in abundance within the houses. Angel shares my fondness for this roof so in about an hour, we were sprawled on the floor, accompanied by a gentle wind, two packets of ciggies, chips and one of my favorite drinks, Nestea Peach for which she received a "You rock!".  Then again after an hour and a half, I found my chin on my drawn knees, my arms hugging myself and tears running down my cheeks, "Oh honey. Gimme a hug! Damn! I wish I never told you that."  Hugging her, I sobbed lightly, "No... it's... it's alright."  "Just get it out. You've been holding back those tears for long." She sat next to me in silence; a feminine sign meaning "Ok. I'm here and listening mode is on."  "It's just...that I have... nobody left in my life that I....can talk to.... you know... I don't talk to my dad no more... thanks...." Taking the tissue, I blew my nose, "...because he rises his defenses whenever I try to talk... I mean.... I can't cry with him anymore.... because...." Another nose blow "...it hurts him to see me crying... he interprets my crying as a failure on his part... failure because he cannot do anything about it for the last 5 years... but that's not the point you see."  I sighed, wiped away my wet cheeks that were soon to be wet again, "I need to talk, Angel.... with someone.... someone who is literally by my side.... someone who will be there for me... I have so many people caring about me... but...." For a few minutes I let the tears flow, "...it's not the same. It doesn't feel the same, too. Thinking I have many people caring about me doesn't help.... because... because they are not within my reach anymore."  She nodded with an understanding I knew for real. Angel had the opportunity to witness the circumstances I live in. She is the last person I let in my life and for a long while she couldn't understand how I could seem helpless. There I was, a talented, beautiful young woman with brains who looked way too well-groomed to be swimming in poverty. Then, slowly, as she witnessed my life closely, it started making sense to her. She realized the abyss between my make up and my reality. Finally, one morning, when I let her into the apartment while everyone was sleeping (I cannot invite friends over to where I live. My uncle cannot stand a stranger's presence in his vicinity. He turns aggressive and insulting which led to everyone living in that apartment who had been close to their family, abandon them eventually) she couldn't believe her eyes. "Will you not be friends with anyone after I'm gone?", she inquired.  I shook my head and took a deep breath, "No. I had to deal with enough departures. I will not go through that again. I will wave you goodbye towards your star-lit career in Australia and that will be for the last time."  "But I will be back, Aura. You know we will keep coming back. Your friends will be coming back."  "That's what I'm saying, Angel" I smiled weakly as I sighed a sigh that comes after sobs pass off, "I don't have anyone who won't have to come back because will be there already."  The thing that triggered all this was something Angel told me and, in doing so, caught me off-guard. A question that came from Sal while they were driving towards Cafe in the first place and Angel had been telling them about me...   ...A question so intricately simple and only someone naive in a funny way can ask:  "Is Aura happy?"    *  taken from "Stranger" as performed by Elisa.

       Timeline:  Present  "Well you promised me", I said looking at him severely as I leaned on the wall sidways, left hip slightly edging outwards, "So I don't want you to go."  "I was teasing you, beautiful" he said struggling with the knot of his necktie, "..and it's not the right time for that, yet."  "When will it be  the right time , anyway?" I muttered and arms crossed against my chest, pursed my lips, "I should have known better; Enter the most quicksilver dad of all times."  He sighed and turned to my Granny, "Do you think I shouldn't go, aunt?"  She crossed her legs and crossed her eyebrows, a posture she most probably had practiced to intensify the unpredictability of what might come out of her. "Yes." she said to my surprise, "Not without your daughter."  He shook his head and put on his black, velvet jacket, the most formal looking piece of his "wardrobe" as I tilted my head, "You see...", I insisted playfully, "Even Granny admits I should attend the annual ceremony as your daughter. I am still not presented to the Grand Lodge." He remained silent and I knew that it was the playfulness in my voice that kept him away from temper.  I shrugged and gave it up, turning away to slip into my stillettos as Granny was going on with her argument, "If this dinner requires a spouse or daughter's accompany, you have one. Why not taking her?"  I raised my head and traced a hand on a dark brown lock that fell on my cleavage, "It's alright, Granny." I said finally, "I best remain hidden and invisible to the world as always!"; A sarcastic remark my dad is quite used to hearing, indeed.  I didn't hear him come home last night since I was weary of my uncle's attack made up of constant howling, wailing, crying and screaming so I took a bunch of sleeping pills and buried my head under my pillow earlier than usual. In the morning, a little item was standing on the bed table... an item resembling a jewelry box. Rubbing my eyes, I reached for it, not quite comprehending what was inside.  It didn't dawn upon me at first sight... then, very slowly, the leafy outline of the elegant brooch within and the tiny pearl attached on it brought along a meaning.  It was the Masonic brooch given to the daughters and wives of Masons after their presentation ceremony to the Grand Lodge.

       Timeline:  Present  Water I soused on my face ran down in a chilling fall from my cheeks towards my chin where they formed a thin stream before they are reduced to droplets and finally a tiny drop. I opened my eyes and saw it through my wet eyelashes as it twitched its antennas helplessly under the shelf above the drainpipe. Tangled amidst a crossroad of web, the little cockroach was almost emaciated, almost a step away from waste. Its shell was thinned, a leg was missing and those that were remaining seemed a translucent white. Incapacitated, it was dangling from a viscid, nearly invisible thread which possessed an ironic similarity to the tie that it was binded to life with. If cut loose, the creature would fall into the unknown incapable of resistance. The unknown was infinite. What might seem like a little water drop by the sink to larger beings was a drowning bubble for it... or it could have fallen into the basin, carried away by the watercourse towards a fatal fall into the sewer through the cesspool... or....  Like having been sucked to death alive by a spider was not enough.  I reached forth, gently liberated it from the trap to which it didn't even react.. Barely another twitch of the antenna, perhaps. Taking it to my Cocoon, I started searching for a safe spot where it might have one last opportunity to recuperate. The side table? No.. It was too hazardous. It shouldn't be left vulnerable to its companions. Companions that were even more depraved than the spiders ambushing in the shadows. I had already seen other cockroaches brutally consuming their disabled kin. Those who could barely escape the spider's grab and weakened, fell prey to their very own species. Thus, I took a Kleenex and laid it on the bookshelf which was a less popular domain in this habitat they had created over more than a decade. Then I went outside, took a sugar cube, came back, placed it on the Kleenex and carefully set the cockroach on top of the cube.  I had no prerequisite knowledge as to the regenerating abilities of these insects. I was thinking that maybe it could feed on the sugar (all things sweet are their favorite, I observed that much. They are even worse than audacious street cats that are used to being fed by thoughtful versions of mankind and expect the same generosity from all. These creatures don't care whether you're in the middle of your meal or not, just pop in out of the blue and start munching on a crumb next to your plate) and somehow gather its strength before it went on with its life...  ...although, since quite a bit of it was missing, it was obvious that it wouldn't be very popular in the mating season (which is like...bi-daily for cockroaches. They are quite a merry if not hedonistic species).  So much for the cockroach, I left my Cocoon for the dinner table. During the dinner, I tried to disregard the sight of the tomato sauce on my uncle's beard although spending five years in a dwelling that would be more than suitable for a setting of any Cronenberg movie, one gets immune to such sights alongside repugnant sounds. After all, these people tend to fart in your face as they pass you by and act like that's the most nonchalant thing in the universe. It wouldn't be an understatement if I claimed they are on the same socialization scale with an orangutan.  When my dad and uncle left the table, I turned to my Granny and uttered, "Well... summer is around the corner."  She nodded, "We still have April rains ahead. They are precious."   Oh this was new.  "What is so precious about April rains, Granny?" I asked out of curtsey rather than curiosity.  "Old Greek houses used to have rainboxes to store April rains, child." She said in a weary tone which implied everyone but me was aware of that. She, then, leaned over and whispered sternly as if she was passing over a precious family recipe with which I was to pamper my husband before passing it on to the next generation, "Never the March rains, though. They aren't worth a dime... but the April rains... oh the April rains are precious..."  She so looked like a pre-transitioned Gollum. I cleared my throat and smiled nervously. I find listening to such traditions quite enjoyable unless they are conveyed in a manner that makes me feel I'm a part of the Twilight Zone, "Why did they find it so valuable?" I asked deliberately avoiding the word  precious . "Is it naturally undiluted? Ideal for drinking...or mmm...daily facial cleaning?..."  She got up floundering and picked up her plate, "The laundry, child" she croaked, "It's ideal for laundering". Then without another word, turned around and staggered towards the kitchen.  Failed to  save  the cockroach which is now wrapped up in a Kleenex and rests in peace in the trash can, I was left with a beautiful image  saved  in my mind, at least. Barefoot women chatting as they transferred the April rain they stored in their rainboxes into a large tub before they dump a pile of clothes into it and exchange the current gossips whispered in Constantinople.  A superior save, for certain.

       :: ICHOIR ::  Timeline:  Past (Winter of 1997 - Spring of 1999)  O' the bliss of authority! Take 15 people who believe that vocally they are as talented as a spider during webmaking (grandiose grandiose) and place them in a semi circle in front of a piano placed on a platform where the victim is being auditioned. Also try to imagine them, having been told that it'll perhaps include some sense of seriousness into the mockery, holding papers and pens the latter of which are judgementally tapped against a cheek or lips as they stare at you, heads relatively tilted.  Certainly, you don't take it all as a travesty when your head is counted among those that are tilted. You are, after all, the jury; One of those dickheads who is to be the Azrael or Rafael of someone's hopes. Well... the problem was no matter how much an ego-boost the entire thing was to me and my friends, our scythes were rotten and halos looked cheesy. So once we listened to all those who were willing, we remained seated, pens still tapping, heads still tilted, eyes still blank... the air was still with the anticipation of a beginning. Finally, Avarel said something like, "Let's start with our personal favorites" and bingo! As if having been cursed by the "yakety-yak" spell, we had an unstoppable discussion that lasted for  an hour   two hours   three hours  the rest of the evening. This was the sign of what was to come for the next two and a half years of my life. Neverending brainstorming, tiresome discussions which almost always led to a dead-end since you can rarely make everyone happy.  And here we were a vocal group... of 12 people.... willing to be professionals.... getting used to each other, gradually... liking each other... then, finally, loving each other.... then turning into an inseparable little community which ended up living together...  ...yet rarely knowing how to discuss something properly since we were from an academic setting where everyone thought he/she was  the  most creative,  the  most brilliant,  the  most talented,  the  one! However, today, I know that such is the way of life. Who gives a damn about maturing their interaction skills on a personal basis when there are millions out there around the corner whose adrenaline are climaxed when they're faced with the slightest of opposition or something ever gets close to implying, "Look you're wrong!".  We rarely train our psyche in a way to interpret "Look you're wrong" as "The fact that you claim I'm wrong doesn't necessarily makes you right, either". This drastically reduces one's tension momentarily and gives one the opportunity to relax and listen. Still, we snap back and indulge ourselves in a claw-versus-claw affaire d'honneur. Rationality across a chance for some power trip? No way!  So Ichoir was formed. I'm not even going into the painful discourse which lasted for weeks until we reached an agreement on the name. Mythology ran to aid. We took Icarus as the Muse, played with the name a little, came up with a derivative which was destined to be mispronounced by every single person who came across it written somewhere but still, we all loved it.  Ironic enough, although we couldn't have foreseen it back then, the fate of Ichoir would be no different from the mythological figure it was inspired by. FYI, Icarus was the son of Daedalus with whom he was imprisoned in a tower on the island of Crete. To be able to escape the island, they built themselves wings from the only element they could cast their hands on which was wax. Daedalus warned his son about not getting too close to the sun yet he dismissed this warning for whatever reason and, wings melted, fell into the Egyptian sea, successfully drowning himself and in doing so earning a mythical status. History learned a good deal from him.   Dying young recklessly is still the key element in turning into a myth, after all.   Conclusion:  After two and a half years full of pain and laughter, Ichoir made 4th place in Roxy Music Days and ended up having an album. The feedback was surprisingly positive. However, Avarel had been just married to a girl from Trinidad whom he had met on the net and our mother-in-law capriced her way skillfully into her husband's bed which led to him dropping the group right after our first "real" concert. All the effort, all the dreams, all the you-name-its went to trash thanks to arbitrary vaginal contractions. Beheaded, Ichoir slowly drowned and left us with a longing alongside a thousand memorable moments and lifelong friendships (as in Charon and Rain Man).

       :: LETTER INTO THE PAST ::  Timeline:  Present Perfect   "...I (am just writing this as I think, so apologise if it's a bit rambley) was just missing you and wondering about how you were, so thought I'd send a mail to ask...  ...you know how sometimes something just hits you, like as if it's a memory coming back, a wave of it almost.. Is a hard thing to workout whether it's the feeling still being there, or a reminder of how things felt at a different time. As much as anything I think I'm just wanting to know that you are OK, and well, and happy, or to know if you aren't even, and to know if I could help in any way if you weren't..."   This (and more) from someone who knew me perhaps no longer than a week sometime in the past. As opposed to the lacking openness and genuinity from the rest whom I gave a part of my thoughts, a part of my life, a part of my heart. How many men only fell for the aforementioned picture perfect image? Even sadder, how many of them were even aware of the fact that what they desired to possess was a reflection they were so determined to idolize?  Whenever I handled the heart, it bled. The heart was kept in a safe and the make-up was revered. How many times the fuck is disguised as lovemaking?    You fuck "some body " but only love "some one "!   The mirror continues to muse me.  It takes to be a (hu)man to even get close to the latter. It needs completion of self evolution even to the slightest degree. It needs usurping scary territory. It requires holding tighter as opposed to relinquinshing across the first instant your partner takes a misstep somewhere in the tango. It needs dynamics, a rhythm that takes up many a long nights and even longer days to synchronize. It demands acquintance; Conversance of a scent, a taste, a gaze, a nonsensual detail... It calls for endurance, flexibility and a lot of hit points. It needs to be a virtuoso of survival through horrid terrains. It also depends on spell points for there comes a time when strength is not adequate and a miracle is essential.  Yet for all that to flourish, it necessitates determination.  And if the world lacks something it is not goddamn love but determination, instead!  And that is why I thank you!   For being generous and tagging me along into those moments when you feel deep inside that a rememberance of me fills your surroundings with a sweet aroma. I thank you for giving me a smile as genuine enough as whatever you have in your sanctuary. I thank you for opening a door without having any expectation from me to step inside but an anticipation instead for making me to smell that fragrance. I thank you for the comfort you present although you are miles and miles away. I thank you for not caring about how it would seem or sound to convey your thoughts, your most sacred sentiments and in doing so exceeding all the artificiality that "man kind" possesses. I thank you for dismissing all the "what if"s and overcoming self-restrictions. Thus, I thank you for making me see that there are still men out there who can depict themselves in a chivalrous, articulate manner without a second thought (Because on second thought comes the fear of making an ass of yourself!).  I thank you for feeling for me from across a horizon in a way that makes me think that within only a week you could see through my looking glass more than any men who have ever stepped in my life.. that you not only  listen ed to me but also  hear ed all I had to say. I thank you for the ephemeral bliss, emerging via your thoughts and best wishes, creating a transient Oasis within the abysmal desert stretching all around me.   The world is a better place for there are people like you...  ...you who is astute enough to be   simply,   sincerely,   plainly ,  you!

       :: AMIDST THE LOOKING GLASS ::  Timeline:  Present       I love this moment captioned from my life wherein I am photographed as a misty reflection in a mirror. A cigarette whose smoke is interlacing with that of the burning incense on a nearby table accompanies me and I am shaded by the morning lightfall. Today, I am feeling precisely as a reflection; cut loose from the actuality of the reflection's owner, ie. my very self, as I stand outside, looking in.  Or like an Alice "Through The Looking Glass" who had just stepped right through the mirror,  "began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible."   A foundation can cover the skin, a lipstick could make pale lips crimson, a blush could flush blood-drawn cheekbones and voila! The reflexion is complete for the world outside.... turning me into a mirror image that fails to reflect everything behind although the cover is picture perfect.  I smash the mirror; The Mirror Crack'd.  Now which one of those infinite Auras is the real me?

       :: ALL THERE WAS IN A STROKE ::  Timeline:  Present  What is the dictionary meaning of the word  exhausted ? Take it, multiply by fifty and end up eventually catching a glimpse of the state I am in. Err... don't go as far as wires sticking out from odd cavities and tubes inserted into various labial regions, though. I am not that tired yet. Yet close. Really close, considering I spent the night on an unsteady chair thanks to its broken leg, faced the fact that my uncle might be suffering from a stroke, saw my granny halfway into lamentation as my father tried to take things under control... and that's not a sight for swollen eyes who had just been witnessing a dream sequence starring a really,  really  hot ex. So much breath control, so much painkillers and so much confusion wafted in the sickening, insalubrious air of the living room all throughout last night. Honestly, I really don't know how we would end up like, had my uncle's heart finally let go of its beating.  Would my granny loose the plot? Give it a go herself and not even let the poor guy burn alone, finally away from her in hell? They have this pathetic bond formed at birth which she carried one step further which was enough to cause her son to end up loosing his mind. They have this love-hate, "can't live with or without you" relationship thanks to her being like a vulture circling above on the near-dead body of his all their lives.  I was scared ladies and gentlemen. I was so full of pity for this huge form lying on the sofa, suffering from chest pains and breathing heavily that it scared me. I sat there, staring at and away from him as my granny's voice crescendoed and decrescendoed with panic. I, on the other hand, was unaware of a way to let him know that I felt for him. That in this abysmal world of self-indulgent personalities including very much of his obsessive compulsive mother, I could understand him.  More than once he yearned to die. He has cursed God continiously for letting him live in a hindered state. During his mania, he hates God with all his being, keeps swearing continiously and in a quite ridiculous manner at a creator he had never seen a favor from. All his life was wasted among those walls that he happened to call home but I know that it was his dungeon. Worse, he is aware of it, either. He may be a manic depressive schizophrenic but he is aware of reality that much. Although he twists it to his benefit now and then, he knows that there is happiness out there. He knows there are people working towards their dreams out there, having sex, watching stars twinkle as they sat on a beach. He knows there are people holding hands, falling in and out of love, standing up for each other, backstabbing each other.   All those things that he has never had the chance to experience himself.  He knows that somewhere out there, there are people living on the streets. I know for I heard him mutter, "Heavens help those who are outside." once when it was raining cats and dogs in the middle of the night.  I was surprised ladies and gentlemen. Surprised that he muttered a sentence that was so familiar to me since I, myself, always think of those people when thunders break, winds howl, snowflakes fall. I even think of cats and dogs and birds outside but alas this is not the time for disclosing those corners of myself that might arise sympathy. It has nothing to do with me.  Or has it not, really?  I looked at that pale face and knew that he was not ready for that final stroke of the second. No matter what he says, no matter how much a parody he may seem to me, no matter how much I despised him when her mother started bitching behind me and he didn't oppose and stand up for his nephew, I knew he was not as ready as he had appeared. I knew that he was distressingly helpless against this Fate whose control he had lost so long ago that it was too hard for him to visualize what it was like before.  A Fate whose control was never given to him, anyway.  Her mother who should have been the one to teach him to fly, broke his wings and imprisoned him to herself. The God, he believed in, turned away from him, not listening to his prayers nor saving him from an electroshock therapy when he was only 17. This figure lying on that faded sofa was so fragile behind that hulking body that it brought unshed tears to my eyes.   He knows, ladies and gentlemen. Perhaps he knows so much more than you or I do. During a moment of pain wave, he opened his eyes and looked straight ahead. That  straight ahead  happened to be in my direction and our eyes met. Within that milisecond, he told me things that he could never ever utter before. Within one glance the following was hidden, "Aura, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not being a true uncle to you. I'm sorry for being broken. I'm sorry for not helping you but I know what you are going through. I'm sorry for not being there for you whenever you need a shoulder to cry on. I'm sorry for all those things I could have done and become but I couldn't. I'm sorry for not being able to be of help for all this crap we are stuck in. I'm sorry to live in an altered reality."  Then his stare weakened and my Granny gave a witchy shriek but that didn't stop us from entwining our fears and, to our surprise, finding a common denominator. He asked the unspoken "What are we gonna do, Aura? What am I gonna do? What do you do when you feel a chilling touch of wretchedness?... of helplessness? How do you cope with it?"  To which I silently mused my questions back, "How do you escape into your own reality? How do you manage to deal with being an outcast? Is being crazy really an answer? If I went out of my mind and did whatever I wanted to do, would I be granted forgiveness yet end up in an asylum, still? My past and all that I had to go through having been ignored, would I be denied sympathy and given the cold walls of a mental hospital echoing with the cackling glees of lunatics as an answer? Is it better in there, uncle? Is it better to let go and not fight?"  He closed his eyes. I lowered my head and Granny sobbed dramatically. My father reached forth and kept on uttering soothing statements. He had been there before. He knew what it was like, this was not a stroke. We should all be calm.  That instant, I knew, too. It had nothing to do with knowing. It was all about not knowing, instead. Clenching my fists, I fixed my gaze on my uncle's chest as he sighed. Death could never be welcomed by him, I saw that much.  Because death was not a redemption for those who never really lived.  A sour moment, perhaps, to re-open one's eyes into another reality and retort, "So now what? I was dead anyway."  Just like the morning was not a start for those who never slept, either. So when the first rays of the sun streaked in, my uncle was feeling better. Still, last night was never to be forgotten. As I got ready to leave the house, he was already up and around, trying to confront his still weeping mother.   And when I smiled at him, made sure that he was alright, he smiled back and asked, "You're going, Aura?"  "Yes, uncle. Anything you want me to get for you on my way back?"  Dismissing that question, he said, "It always saddens me when you go."  I turned around and rushed out.  If I wasn't sure whether or not he knew by then, I now did.   We both did.

       :: MUSINGS II ::  Timeline:  Present  * Not only my ears are functioning properly but my right ear that gives me the Darth Vaders came out to be a sonar. Half a decibel more and I could hear dolphins chattering as I swim underwater. Ironic enough, I am given a nasal spray made up of pure ocean water. After one week of usage, I will be re-examined and if the indiscribible problem still exists, I will go through blood tests. If they come out alright then the further step will be a tomography. The problem shifts from having a problem towards the vagueness of the diagnose process... and the fortune it will cost. Being formally IDless hinders me from having an insurance (not that I can pay for an insurance, anyway) so that means I will face the full blow when it comes to the financial burden of these procedures. Well I'm living in a "developing" country with little or no concern towards the health of those who are broke. Tell me life is fair.  * Last night, I was going through the last issue (March 2004) of Elle that I burrowed from Angel. I turned a page to come across an article that caused a smirk. Usually, I am a being that minds her own business and can be considered as incurious. The article, though, is too interesting to remain silent towards.  I'm certain that many have heard about Bloggers' darling,  urlLink Belle De Jour  and the trivia surrounding her. The book deal that spurted forth from her blog, the quintessential movie rights and whatsoever. Well possums (as Dame Edna would no doubt top off), it's so old a news, let me tell you that much.  For a start, I have to admit that Belle deserves the attention she gets. She is, after all, a witty writer who works "hard" for the money which makes her life interesting to read for many. I read her diary quite a while myself and have nothing to say when it comes to her too articulate a writing, her testestrone provocative abilities along with a unique approach towards life. She is yet another example of the fact that "sex sells" and anyone who keeps bitching about her newfound career as a professional writer can eat that.  What I have to oppose at this point is the backbite that those who are inspired by her being a little too much such as  urlLink Belle De Jew  and  urlLink Beau De Jour  might receive. Because according to this article, Belle's path, ie. A-list call girl turns A-list blogger turns A-list author, is not something terribly original, either.  The article informs its readers that an A-list (that must be the key word) New Yorker call girl named Tracy Quan has just published her controversial novel which is built upon 15 juicy years of classy prostitution experience behind the closed doors of deluxe hotels. The interesting part is, she caught the attention of publishers after having started writing a column in the online literary magazine  urlLink Salon.com  sometime back in 1999. The book is described as  "a darkly funny novel about life in the higher echelons of the New York sex indsutry and is based on the column of the same name."   ...and that name happens to be: " urlLink Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl ". A pity that it rings a bell(e) that chimes "Diary of a London Call Girl".  Let's not skip the white screen rights issue, either. Thrilled to see "Even Call Girls Get the Blues"? Yearn no longer since the article states:   "The film rights have already been snapped up by everyone's favorite big-screen-call-girl-Pretty Woman herself Julia Roberts- for her production company, Red Orn.  Sex and the City  creator Darren Star is set to direct and Lucy Lui is rumored to be up for playing the lead (the film is due out in the UK next year)."   So the English publishers and producers are in a rush to beat Manhattan with bloody ol' London?  Whatever that may be, the online trend is setting up a call girl-themed journal, "cum" and "go" between multiple orgasms and wait until the thing eventually gets big these days. Good luck to all those who follow the footsteps of Tracy Quan who, it seems, is the original concept holder and, well, righteously beat everyone else to it.   - Quotes taken from Elle, March 2004, UK Edition, "The Secret Life of an A-List Call Girl", pg. 175-178

       Timeline:  Present  This will come directly from inside, For I ran out of ornaments for vocabulary.  I am walking on a deserted highway today. And a cushion of air, My feet -- They don't touch my ground. If there is such thing like an ethereal walk,  Here I am -- Walking it.  And there are no apparitions for me to hijack. I am in the middle of everywhere A blade without its handle cutting both ways In my hands. I'm the self-proclaimed Amazon of Decease.   I miss the middle of my nowhere. Do you believe me? If only I knew.  But maybe it is all about not knowing. No no no! It is all about knowing everything yet Choosing not to remember everything.  Do you understand? If only you did.  I stand on the wrong side of the sea, Bearing wrong side of Fate. If only I remembered how to swim. If only you waited for me on the shore.  The highway merges into the ocean, Which streams into the horizon. This sea-bearing symbol aids me in a water walk, Led by the trace of moonlight.  There is a distant hymn in the air A Seraph flies past the sky Mistaken for a comet by the naked eye And amidst this cleaving halluscination... ...Can you complete that sentence for me? If only you could.  I am following your absence tonight. An errand to need you. A kaleidoscope to have but not to hold. Will you refill the space you leave around me? If only you would!  I am by myself as The clock strikes twelve -- Today is  Mayday . Once a self-selected lover told me I wrote misery Better than I did happiness. They all told me my beauty was at its peak when in rage. Now you see why I became their gravedigger! Do you have a poem for me? If only you did.  My lips run dry -- They cannot cry. And right here behind my eyes... ...you are. Hidden against everything worldly. But am I secluded likewise? If only I were.  I may be a genie in the bottle you hold. Or jasmine on a flying carpet. I know a whole new world by heart. But can you be the Aladdin of an Arabian tale? If only you could.  If you let me be your Scheherazade, The one to adorn your thousand and one nights, I will never leave your side until you sleep safe and sound. Will you still slaughter me in the end? If only I could tell.  To kiss this tempest some solace, End the Titans' reign for a new tomorrow, Be my God Through whom I experience I So that I'll be your Goddess Through which you experience you. But am I the Muse on your lips? If only I were.  I have a life vacant for you A love completely healed -- should that be your heart's wish. Crimson possibilities in azure togetherness. But do you have a stare spared or a song solely sung for me Deprived of ambiguity? If only you had.  Despite all the privy clauses I bouse I still walk on these tidal waves That carry your trace, my Lighthouse. Will you illume your eyes on time?  if only you d id n ot l et  me d r o w n. . .

       Timeline:  Past (Spring of 1999)    Reminder:  Click  urlLink here  to refresh your memory with The Scarlet Letter - Part One.   "So you were directed to us from Endocrinology, I see. It is usually the other way around...." The female professor mumbled as she flipped the papers over, "...Kleinefelter syndrome, genetic intersexuality..." She, then, smiled a smile that was as artificial as gum flavor. Accordingly, it soon faded.  We were sitting at a small, dreary, somber office that only had one window overlooking the cold, gray, concrete walls of the unit it was located across. Cardiology, I read as my stare hovered over people rushing in and out alongside nurses, doctors and medical students alike. Trees were as sparse as they could get and the heavy pedestrian traffic marked the abundance of people after health. I wondered how many were going to reclaim it and realized that even health was directly related to wealth in this "developing" country I was living in. If these people had the latter, they would probably have been showered with treatment opportunities without having to move a finger. However, there they were, hurrying in and out while, being the patients themselves, feeling sick and weary. Noticing the majority of them were old people who were floundering in pain, I felt a knot in my throat and felt the necessity to clear it almost in sychronization with the professor.  It was then I realized I still hadn't responded to her statement."Yes...", I said as I turned to her and mimicked her superficial smile, "... it seems that they focus on my biology but you are the ones who will take care of the gender dysphoria part."  She raised an eyebrow which forced me to rephrase myself, "Err.. help me with it, that is."  She nodded seriously and opened what seemed like a notebook while I fidgeted on my chair. Although it was early spring and sun was reigning outside, here in this pocket-size room, even sunlight seemed dormant. She went over the papers that I had handed her once more before starting her questionnaire, "Your age?"  "22", I responded uneasily.  "Your degree of education?"  "I am studying at Bayside University. Western Languages and Literatures."  She noted something down before going on, "How long have you been feeling like this?"   Feeling ? I blinked, "Feeling like what?"  "Feeling like you are feeling. How long have you been feeling like a female?" She tapped the back of her pen on the paper which, I guessed, was a gesture to intensify her professionalism but ended up seeming as if she was being impatient with me.    There was a time when men were kind When their voices were soft And their words inviting There was a time when love was blind And the world was a song And the song was exciting    I think I frowned slightly and sounded a little austere, "As long as I remember."  She noted down again, "Have you ever been with a man?"  "Excuse me?"  She sighed lightly, "Have you ever had sexual intercourse with a man before?"  "No", I said.  "No?", she asked apparently disbelieving, "Not even snogging? Foreplay?"  "No.", if impatience was an issue, it was getting oh-so-mutual, "If I was in a state of enjoying kissing or anything further with a man sexually while I am in this form, I wouldn't be sitting across you at the moment."  "You could have been experimenting." she stated, leaning on the table with her elbows.  "I did my experimenting quite well without letting my hormones interfere with this, thank you." That was true. Solara and I had been barhopping quite a lot (like I wasn't barhopping enough with Charon, Rain Man, our vocal group Ichoir, friends from University, people I had grown up with like Goddess, Gambit, Predator whatsoever) and naturally gay clubs in Ponderland were also a part of our route (I even celebrated a birthday which was attended by a bunch of close friends at one of the oldest and most famous gay bars of Ponderland) and although I was amazed by the fact that I was in the heart of an environment which hosted countless men each one of whom were more handsome than the other, I never fantasized about having a fling with any of them (Our dilemma was and still is so obvious: Do these guys always have to look drop dead gorgeous? Oh what a curse to be a female at times like these). Shortly, I have never been gay and they were as unavailable to me (romantically and/or sexually of course, not friendshipwise) back then as they are today.    There was a time Then it all went wrong    She seemed unconvinced as she took her time to jot whatever down. "How do you pee?"  "I go to the bathroom, pull my..."  Anger rose in her voice, "Do you stand or sit as you pee?"  "Aaah, I sit" I responded grinning sheepishly and quite satisfied to see her maddening.    I dreamed a dream in times gone by When hope was high And life worth living    "Does your family know about your feelings?"  Feelings, again. What did this have to do with feelings, I wondered. It was simply about  being  not feeling. "Yes, they do."  "How do they react to it?" I wondered whether she was doing this deliberately or not. My father was waiting outside in the corridor. We had arrived here together. What the hell did she think he was feeling about it?  "My family consists of my grandmother and father. My mother died 6 years ago. As for my father, he takes it very well." She kept writing as I concluded, "So does my Grandmother."    I dreamed that love would never die I dreamed that God would be forgiving    "Do you have any serious illnesses?"  "Not that I know of."  "Family history?"  "Heart attack and a by-pass on my dad's side and cancer on my mother."    Then I was young and unafraid And dreams were made and used and wasted There was no ransom to be paid No song unsung No wine untasted    "You have two options, ahead.", she began closing her notebook and setting her pen on top of it, "You can either start with one-on-one therapy or directly attend our group therapy which takes place once every month. I highly recommend the latter. However, the choice is yours. It would help you greatly and speed up your process if you met those who share your feelings and who are on the same road as you are."    But the tigers come at night With their voices soft as thunder As they tear your hope apart And they turn your dream to shame    "I see. Then, I will go for the group therapy." To be completely honest, I was not at ease with this decision at all. I couldn't visualize myself sitting in a group of men in drag, failing miserably at their exaggerated gesticulating in the name of femininity as they talk in a low key. Obviously, I was as effected by the general impression of transsexuals as anyone and had my share of prejudice. It embarrasses me to recall it today because when I met them a month later and saw how  real , how   obvious  their misery and rejection due to the amount of bigotry they kept receiving because of the likes of me (prejudiced, neglecting instead of understanding, deaf instead of listening) were, I did my best to be there for them, to reassure them that they were perfect the way they were, to implement the slightest of self-esteem in them which they had lost thanks to their surroundings.    He slept a summer by my side He filled my days with endless wonder He took my childhood in his stride But he was gone when autumn came    With that she got up and handed me my papers and hospital records back, "I wrote two notes for you that will grant you entrance to the group therapy. Give them to the doctors who will attend the therapy. You will see that the next meeting is on June the 9th. Now I want to talk to your dad." She opened the door and led me outside while she invited my dad in. She might even have patted me on the shoulder to give the impression to my dad that all went swiftly and according to plan but I may be mistaken. The door closed behind them and there I was in a sterile, fluorescent-lit corridor all by myself, again.    And still I dream he'll come to me That we'll live the years together    I walked towards the window and was greeted by more concrete instead of a welcoming sight. My hands and feet were totally cold and while rubbing my hands against each other, I was taken aback by a chilling shriek that echoed in the corridors. Aside from the occasional bypassers (usually nurses) I was all alone in that narrow hallway. My heart was pounding when I heard footsteps and a myriad of screams accompanying the commotion coming closer.     I had a dream my life would be So much different from this hell I'm living So different now from what it seemed    A young man wearing casual hospital clothing turned around the corner, arms waving frantically in the air while he seemed as if he was running for his life. I instinctively nailed myself to the wall and got out of his way while a group of hospital personnel emerged from around the corner shouting at him. He was only inches past me when they caught up with him and threw themselves (literally) on him.   While the man kept shouting, kicking, biting, clawing, he was responded with fists. His chasers soon got a hold on him since the poor guy was beaten to unconsciousness in under a minute. All the while they picked his form up, half-dragged him out of sight and disappeared, I was frozen, probably seemed as if I was hung up on the wall from my nape and couldn't dare to move even a finger for quite some time.    But there are dreams that cannot be And there are storms we cannot weather    When my dad and professor got out of the room, they seemed oblivious to the previous tumult which I thought was heard by the entire hospital. Either the rooms were soundproof or I was hallucinating and nothing had taken place because it was impossible not to be effected by the man's helpless screams.  Parent and doctor shook hands before she threw one last shallow smile at me and returned to her office.  I let myself led by my dad outside and only partially listened to whatever he was saying. We went past the plaque next to the entrance which read, " Ponderland Memorial, Psychiatry Department"  and went on walking towards the car. So this was an asylum, alright. So these people were blase towards such scenes; They were immune to such sounds and sights. But how was  I  going to deal with it even if that was going to be once every month?  It was then I remembered the notes. There they were right on top of the pile I was carrying. The one I was looking at included the following scribble:  "1300 - June 9th, Ponderland Memorial Psychiatry Department, Schizophrenia Group Room."  And the other went,  "Aura Mars, 22, diagnosis: transsexual, to be monitored."  With that, my 22 years, all that I have been going through, all that I have been trying to depict for the last 6 months were summerized in one short, scientific, insentient categorization!    Now life has killed The dream I dreamed.    ~   I Dreamed A Dream  (composed for Fantine) as appears in the musical Les Miserables by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg.

       Timeline:  Present Perfect   "To  Nyx  (Night), Fumigation with Torches.  Nyx , parent goddess, source of sweet repose from whom at first both Gods and men arose. Hear, blessed Kypris (Aphrodite), decked with starry light, in sleep's deep silence dwelling ebon night! Dreams (Oneiroi) and soft ease attend thy dusky train, pleased with the lengthened gloom and feastful strain, dissolving anxious care, the friend of mirth, with darkling coursers riding round the earth. Goddess of phantoms and of shadowy play, whose drowsy power divides the natural day; by fate's decree you constant send the light to deepest hell, remote from mortal sight; for dire necessity (Ananke), which nought withstands, invests the world with adamantine bands. Be present, Goddess, to thy suppliant's prayer, desired by all, whom all alike revere, blessed, benevolent, with friendly aid dispel the fears of twilight's dreadful shade."   ~Orphic Hymn 3 to  Nyx     ...my bare feet echo naked footsteps on the cobblestones... The fullness of Mother Luna chills me for the first time... clouds be her veil... before the spiral marble stairs leading down to the shore, lightning bugs waltz in a  fire ball ... I wear nothing but myself... and the satin of my white gown... thin straps holding it at bay... the transparent white of my skin dribble into the achromatic scenery...   I am consisting of dissonant steps against your call...  ...pulling my skirts gently, I follow the trail to enigma... what reason holds your summon to Night?... what reason holds being a moth to your flare?...  to Night is your call against mine... essence neglects the roar of psyche... down and down towards an ebbed beach... you lull me...  my toe touches the cold sand... the chill resembles your exhale... wrapping my arms around me in vain, I subdue this gelidity of not knowing... the sand is still... the sea is taken aback... all there is lag in a hush...  ...a shadowy pile against the grey of sand... a movement in black... the veil lifts abruptly to lighten up my path... hesitantly, I move... sands sizzle beneath my feet... tilting my head slightly, nighty cloud of my hair brush over one bare shoulder...  ...a moan wafts towards me... the heaviness of your breath distinguished... my eyes make a form out of the shadow... a gasp buried beneath my lips...  that torso I know by heart... that scent which holds my days... that being I call my shrine... in all his grandeur...  ...entwined with another!  ...a stranger...  ...piercing eyes open to meet me... not halting even for a heart beat... you look through me... and finally display your reality... the woman tranced beneath your body... held away in you... pleasure of the moment belongs to her...  ...your look deepen... your thrust in this  any body  ... can never match your thrust in my soul... the ebb flows... the breeze returns... the female cries and closes around you... but your eyes remain flowing in me...  ...for another moment, I linger... before I finally break the tie...

       Timeline:  Present  These days, we experience a possible outcome of setting someone free in the form of a chaotic reprise to our symphony. While you follow the road of Love, sunshine, butterflies and rainbows such negative responses resemble coming across a polluted rivulet that stinks. When that happens, it takes a lot of personal motivation to keep breathing and going, "How beautifully stinking this swamp is in its own perfection".  It is difficult yet not impossible.   (Omigod hunk alert!)   It is just a matter of practice.   (Look at those abs!)   If I focus on training my mind accordingly, it will get easier by day.   (Oh what a gorgeous hair style is that!?)   Thus, in time, I will not have to take an effort in consciously choosing to think likewise but instead...   (And those long, powerful legs... herewego herewego, he turns around!)   ..will be doing it instinctively.   (That's the cutest piece of behind I've ever seen in my life!)   The thing is I choose to respect decisions...   (The wedding finger! The wedding finger!)   ...no matter how negative their effect may be on my reality.   (Thankfully no ring!)   After all, if I am to avoid this negative effect, I can always choose to do so.   (This started feeling like I'm a part of some Harlequin Desire)    Just like I have been doing at home and obviously succeeding in it greatly.   (You know that instant attraction and the immense heat the girl receives from the guy)   Actually I have been surprising my family and everyone around me quite a lot these days.   (Oh yes I so feel the heat that I'm having a tan! Gimme the sunscreen!)   My father keeps praying, "I wish you stay like you are always, beautiful!"   (Then again is it love at first sight? Only nipples can tell)   I fathom that's a good thing.   (Harlequin girls don't realize they are in love until they have erect nipples upon seeing the Harlequin guy. Since they always get the guy, nipples' credibility should not be underestimated)   I keep receiving the same positive feedback from all that I touch in my real life.   (But well.. he is so good looking. Perhaps he's gay?)   I think I am getting a hold on to "Beingness vs. Doingness".   (Oh he takes out a mobile. I should have mine at hand, too. Just in case)   I forgot to mention that we have new people joining us everyday!   (He looks at me! I think I'm dying. Fan fan...)   One of them is an old friend of mine whose name (Tigris) kept flashing in my mind as soon as we started this project.   (He turns away muttering, "I love you too, hun" to the receiver)   After a long discussion on Sunday and yesterday, Tigris is now family.   (Hmph! Right!)   Last night him and Solara met personally and obviously loved each other.     (On second thought, he was too good looking)   I never have thought I could experience such heights of Love before I joined HT.   (And good looks and cerebral activity are usually inversely correlated)   I breathe Love.. and it doesn't make me sick as it did in the past any longer. However, to be able to reach this state of Love that is shared by thousands, I needed to have experienced being by myself for some time to heal older forms of heartache.   (Yeah, walk away, sweetie. Blessings to you for the hormonal discharge you brought to my day.)   Not having a relationship for more than 2 years gave me time to be on my own so that I could face my former relationships -be it with family members, friends or lovers- and forgive myself. That is not an easy process and I still have so much gaps to fill. Yet, I do know that the thousand hands that hold mine shall help me a great deal in the matter.   (Back to work)   This looks like a beautifully stinking swamp and is perfect in its own way. There Sol! We have a safe bridge that is constructed via understanding and connects the two sides of the rivulet.   Let the adventure continue...

       Timeline:  Present  I am trying to pick up the answers to the questions: Why is it that whenever I find myself deeply involved in and dedicated to a project, I am always faced by egos of others?, what am I doing to wake up the  beast  in them? and how do I overcome this struggle of opposites through Love's path?  The last question's answer is specifically important because in all the projects I have been, compromise turned out to be a toilsome concept which is closely related to the underlying human belief, "It is impossible to make everyone happy". I choose to believe that it  is  possible to make everyone happy as long as everyone has the same destination. What is arduous is the "convincing" course and this course is the outcome of people who share your destination but are determined to choose their own path in reaching it.  In this case, I choose to free them. Because, I choose to believe, that is the greatest opportunity I can hand out to another. I do not persist on keeping people "together" but instead I encourage them "to gather" their own tools and set sail on their own.  This leads to separateness, for certain.  This leads to break-ups.  This leads to letting go.  Then again, I do not choose to attribute them the negativity we usually link them to.   The prerequisite is to consciously accept that no thing or no one is my  property . When I think out of the box, they are simply there to experience "themselves" via me and I attract them to my reality in order to experience "myself" via them.  My greatest err in my journey would be to try to keep someone from reflecting and expressing his/her great vision about him/herself. If that perfection does not include  mine , if the river comes to a fork, why attempt to block the other branch's run in the hope that its waters will eventually be tamed (suppressed!) and flow in harmony with mine? (Moreover, would I prefer harmony of that kind?)  Setting someone free is a mutual gift in that sense.

       Timeline:  Present   To a disciple who was forever complaining about others the Master said, "If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth."    Anthony de Mello, SJ     I am aware that ever since I have been involved in digging the foundations of the Humanity's Team, I have fallen behind with the  Past  timeline. However, these days, I am going through a brand new phase of enlightenment within myself and this hastily leads to my coming to terms with "all that had happened" in my life so far. New Spirituality enables me to reconsider the past events in my life with a refreshing understanding through a quite painful but cultivating process which includes the fact that I am not the  victim  of the catastrophes that kept occurring subsequently but rather the realization that I am the  creator  of them. The reason of my falling behind in the continuity of my  coming out  story is probably because when I complete this phase, I will be using a totally new set of vocabulary than I would do at the moment.  Hence, "the pain of the process" since it requires a great self realization and being truthful to one's self. Usually, just like everybody else, instead of searching for the  why  of an event, I have happened to actualize it to find an excuse which can also be deciphered as "disguising the fact that I am the cause of all that I am today with a very reasonable approach so as to ignore my being the magnet of that event".  Now to turn this train of thought into reality is easier to say than do. Thus, I decided to take another path and looked at my dad's life which has been our lives for the last 5 years. Obviously, it is much easier to consider others instead of looking deep within yourself and the things that you have been casting aside as you kept lying to yourself.  There are certain statements that my dad had been repeating in the miserable course of events which started making sense as I envisioned him under this spotlight. Almost a week ago, dad and I were going through a conversation which was bouncing back and forth between a discussion and a quarrel. It was a bitter one since I was being quite pushy and was deliberately drawing him towards his borders and making him face the reality that he had been rationalizing. In doing so, I had no intentions to "correct" him, let me explain this part. A most precious understanding New Spirituality has given me is the element of "perfection." Perfection in everything. Yes, even in perfection within poverty (and as you already know, I have been having a thoroughly harsh experience of poverty). I knew that whatever was happening to my dad (and to me via him) was the  perfect  consequence of our choices and states of minds. Thus, just like everybody else, we were creating this "poverty setting" for our own good and nothing could be "judged" in this process.   Everyone experiences his/her deepest beliefs about themselves.  Now if I was somebody else, this probably would have made no sense yet these are my words my friends. You can come up to me and ask, "Aura we have been witnessing and reading your life for 6 months and you are telling us that you have deserved this?". My answer would be, my friends, that it has nothing to do with "deserving" but "choosing" and to be able to understand that choice here I am inviting you to the very cores of my dad and myself.  Here are the things my father said to me during the course of this conversation:  "Aura do you really believe that I have not tried? 5 years ago, I arranged meetings with the managers of the 10 topmost firms in this country and they all told me the same thing, "Sorry, Mr. Mars. You are far beyond our expectations". This is a silkened version of saying, "We are not interested". I tried but I was turned down! At 64, it is not easy to gulp down being rejected. At 64, it is not easy to start all over again..."  Now can you clearly see how he sees himself as? He has rooted beliefs deep in his psyche that "it is not easy" to start life all over again at 64. He actually has rooted  fears  about starting life anew which also implies that he finds it extremely hard to be handed with an opportunity for a beginning. He also possesses a pride (which is also a version of fear because everything, I repeat every thing originates either from   fear   or   love  ) that disables him from keep trying since those initial failures concerning rejection had hurt him in the past. Thus, instead of taking an active route, taking responsibility for these fears and accepting them as they are (which is the crucial step towards changing it), he is taking the passive route and justifying his actions and current state.  Let's go back to hearing him, "...and people are after young, fresh minds instead of an old and soon-to-be obsolete one. That and I couldn't have surrendered to 500 bucks a month as if I'm being pitied. How could you expect me to settle for an amount like that and accumulate the money needed for your new life..."  If you really need one justification, that would be that if dad had "surrendered to 500 bucks a month" 5 years ago, he would have approximately tripled his salary 5 years afterwards and as of today. However, no judgments on my part! Never! I am not recording this conversation to belittle my father but rather analyze and distinguish the elements that his deepest understanding of himself have created as our present.  "...I long for the compassion and unconditional love from my own daughter but I accept the fact that we can never achieve it within our current reality so I search for that compassion in others..."  Interesting. And here I was wondering why on earth I had started feeling irritated by his presence all of a sudden. Why, in 5 long years, had I never ever thought about accusing him of "failing my trust in him" but have been doing so now? However, it is very self-explanatory, is it not? My father has been very skillfully creating this outcome by simply thinking likewise and I was just the pawn on his chessboard. He was altering his thoughts (which are the outcome of one's deepest beliefs and the tools of creation) and we were simply acting accordingly.  "...and even if we did achieve it, I wonder if you could ever forgive either me or your mother for ignoring your birth defect. We have lost the opportunity of building up a healthy parental pattern from your childhood..."  That is even more interesting. I cannot recall claiming the impossibility of building a healthy relationship with my dad even once. Moreover, I never claimed that it was "way too late" for trying after this point. On the contrary, I always stated that it was "never too late". However, the belief is there on my dad's part. If he does not work to change this "belief" than we will obviously experience just that.  However, as I already said, everything is "perfect" in its own way. To accept and embrace this perfectness and to have the freedom of choice across these events is the exciting part. That is to say, my father creates a reality that includes me and then I have two options:   1) I can follow this reality. 2) I can choose to create something new for myself.   What I have been doing for the last 5 years is simply choosing the first option. Hence, neither my dad is nor I am "wrong"; None of us has the "fault". They were simply our choices be it consciously or unconsciously.  Nowadays, this phase I have been going through is making me face all these quite brutally. Because I choose it to be so. I have never been a woman who takes things swiftly (which is, yet another choice). Swift doesn't work for me (there you go. Another belief, another  self  selection). I am quite grateful for the Past timeline of Phantasmemoria since it makes it easier for me to go through them once again and reconsider them.  It is brutal. Yet the effect, when not attempted to be put under control, is quite temporal. As Joan Borysenko, says:   "The paradox of control is simple. The more we try to control life, the less control we have."

       Timeline:  Present   "To  Nyx  (Night), Fumigation with Torches.  Nyx , parent goddess, source of sweet repose from whom at first both Gods and men arose. Hear, blessed Kypris (Aphrodite), decked with starry light, in sleep's deep silence dwelling ebon night! Dreams (Oneiroi) and soft ease attend thy dusky train, pleased with the lengthened gloom and feastful strain, dissolving anxious care, the friend of mirth, with darkling coursers riding round the earth. Goddess of phantoms and of shadowy play, whose drowsy power divides the natural day; by fate's decree you constant send the light to deepest hell, remote from mortal sight; for dire necessity (Ananke), which nought withstands, invests the world with adamantine bands. Be present, Goddess, to thy suppliant's prayer, desired by all, whom all alike revere, blessed, benevolent, with friendly aid dispel the fears of twilight's dreadful shade."     ~Orphic Hymn 3 to  Nyx     Behind my closed eyelids, I hear your whispering touch... Your unconditional desire camouflaged by a cape of amative narrative... why do you soothe me when your presence, your warmth reigning over me is everything I can ever... surrender for? Why are you with me when many a midnight garden await desperately for your water?...  You reach for my nightmared, trembling form... wrap your arms around me... you burn... my match... What shall it take for  us  to become a match... your broad, dusk-filled hands travel on the valley of my spine... and you pull me over you... your cheek resting against mine...  ...And you enter my stage... resting yourself in the depths... the protagonist of my play... the Star of my Nocturne... I hear your monologue finding me from behind the immensity of winds... It concludes with the question, "Better now?"... Our heartbeats synchronize against each other... we lie still in the kernel of shadows... You pulsate swiftly, surrounded by me...  ...and you cradle me in your embrace... lying atop your chest... my face buried beneath your jawline, you utter, "Sleep".  As consciousness gradually escapes me, I now know that I can only sleep... when clothed in you inside out. The lights dim, the curtains fall...   the end of Act II finds us asleep in the eye of the storm  until with dawn you exit the stage... Leaving me alone...   Yet the morn finds me smelling you...  Have I ever told you that my skin absorbs the scent of yours?.. that no matter how far away you may be, I carry  you  on my pores?... that whoever dares to touch me, they know the you in me?... the you  on  me?  ...hear me... susurrate:   Can you read my mind? Do you know what is is that you do to me? I don't know who you are, Just a friend from another star.  Here I am like a kid out of school. Holding hands with a god, I'm a  fool !...   Will you look at me?  Quivering... Like a little girl  Shivering...   ...You can see right through me...   ...Can you read my mind? Can you picture the things I'm thinking of? Wondering why you are, All the wonderful things you are...   ...You can fly!   You belong in the sky!    You and I Could belong to each other...    ...If you need a friend,   I'm the one to fly to.  If you need to be loved,  Here I am...    ...  Read my mind  ...    ~ Can You Read My Mind?  as appears in Superman The Movie.

       Timeline:  Present  I have never been more distressed about living in a country which is made up of an innumerable number of personalities who are completely title oriented. So there they have it! I am the Project Director of Ponderland's Humanity's Team as the elegant printing on my business card states. You cannot come up with something less than that since any title beneath "management, directing or supervision" is kindly ignored. Actually, neither myself nor Sol are focused on our whereabouts in this budding organization. We two act like one and, as far as yesterday went, have realized that we make a purposeful, enthusiastic pair as we complement each other like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle (based on a friendship of almost 10 years), taking up where the other had left, perfectly. It seems our zeal is quite transmissible for all we met in a single day, ended up impressed by our motivation if not by the things we had stated.  The first meeting was with the Manager and PR of the Art Center organizing Neale's conference. The Manager was quite a pathetic case who kept throwing a question our way before remembering to reply a very urgent e-mail (not to mention, by the end of the meeting, I concluded that she had a merry inbox) and heading out. That and I have serious concerns about trusting a woman who looks at the original hand-outs which concludes by a "make sure that nobody leaves the room before blabla" statement, then turns to us and asks, "How are we to make sure nobody leaves the room?". The PR, though, made an impression with her interest in HT, our mission, purpose, where we stand among countless other spiritual groups and obviously, having had read each and every book of Neale that has been published down here, with her basic knowledge about New Spirituality. Personally, she will be the one I shall add to my little book of contactables.  Of course, it was not easy to talk convincingly about a movement that was launched in this country only... let me see... 5 days ago. We still lack an office (though many of the country leaders of Europe do not function through one), a website and a brochure that both briefly states our vision and looks eye catching. These last two will be dealt with by the end of this month and the office should be up & running sometime late in June or early July. Then again, I certainly believe that we do manage swiftly.  The more we talk about it, the clearer our strategy gets. The more we brainstorm about it, the more proficient we get as to how to "sell the product" at hand.  While we were leaving the center, we even arranged having a stand next to Neale's where we will be distributing our brochures as Neale signs his book(s).  The next appointment was with a spiritual with whom Sol had contacted early yesterday. It seems that this man already established a study group based on Tomorrow's God and has been running it for a while now. Sol had been contacted about his activity by the HT Internatonal Liasion thus we arranged a meeting at his hotel... err... room. Seated comfortably while sipping our Earl Greys, we exchanged ideas, got to know each other and I had the impression (which Sol also agreed later on) that he had advanced knowledge on the matter, was very eligible to start a group, yet, whether he was a fitting candidate to facilitate a study group or not was very questionable.  He is a great resource, a walking library at his late 50s. It was and I am certain that it will be quite an experience to be in touch with him. However, he is quite  dominant  which is an adjective we extremely avoid while following the guidelines of both HT's Study and Emotional support groups. Having knowledge in abundance is of no importance to us (I, myself, have not read even 1/3 of the spiritual material presented to this world). On the contrary, we are inclined to "grow together", "learn together", hence, even if our group members have proficient knowledge in the topic at hand, we will not let any one reign the conversations/discussions.  Of course we have no control over what anyone does out there. Still, I have concerns about having this man (will be regarded as Mr. E from this point on) doing it "under" the title of Humanity's Team, without following its group guidelines. Still, it was a great experience to get to know him personally as I feel we will be seeing each other quite often in the coming days.  Having left his hotel around 8 pm, Sol and I decided to pamper ourselves at our favorite Chinese restaurant. While we were having an orgasm devouring our vegetable soups, rice with mixed vegetables, chicken slices with soy sauce and sipping our Chinese tea as post-climactic chill-out company, we were still going over the events of the day and the plans of tomorrow although we had initially agreed that the dinner would be "mission-free".  I arrived home, deranged, at 9:30 pm but I was mentally so hyperactive that I did not go to sleep until 2 am. Sol and I are meeting on Friday and I will have composed a basic "main page" material for our website alongside material written for the brochure, by then. As a friend warned me via e-mail today, I cannot (/don't have enough time to) sit back and savor the bliss of this process with things proceeding in the speed of light.  I am afraid this shall be so until after Neale's conference.  So much to do, so little time...  ...and so much will be accomplished  thanks to  that "so little time" since when us humans have so much time at hand, we tend to be very postponic.

       Timeline:  Present  As you might have realized, Phantasmemoria now has a logo and a cute button down in the Philanthrope section for those who are fond of visual linkage. I owe this to the creative juices of  urlLink Karsh  and I cannot thank enough for the marvelous work he has come up with. He is a great blogger who has been with me from the very beginning. My hearty thanks, Karsh. Keep doing wha... oh wait... I already said that, didn't I?  Aside from this twist, as of today, Blogger turned an upgrade switch on us. Moreover, according to them, they also came up with "tons" of new templates to choose from which can be interpreted as we have "tens" of new templates. Better than nothing when compared to those 5 mundane, excruciatingly simple templates they had had previously.  One great thing they implemented is the Permalink update which gives each entry its own archive page. Ever since I started blogging, my permalinks have never (ne-ver!) worked right and just when I gave up on ever having proper links to my previous posts, they decided to work things out for me. Now each Permalink has a cute URL ending with their title. Thus, the searcher is taken to the entry which directly comes up on its own. Kudos to them!  Another great upgrade seems to be the commenting. Blogger now has its own comments system, it seems. Then again, for some reason, it isn't working right for me... which is not a grand surprise on my part. Alas, I would be astonished, if it did. Maybe someday I will have a technically-very-able reader who will give me a helping hand and I will implement Blogger's own Comments which will not get archived after a point and end up out of reach for free users (as in Haloscan). I can always hope.  What else? Hmm yes.. the visuality. Now and then, I happen to present a snapshot of a reflection of myself in real life out there. Since I do not wish to overload my Photo Bucket account, these images will now show up in an "unrevealed" post somewhere in my Archives as they give way to each other. I will not publicize its whereabouts so that only the dedicated readers (or better say, those who really care) will take their time to locate and see the new photo presented. As I do now, I will inform you that a new photograph is available and you will have your photo hunt at the "many" (pun intended) archives to spot the entry it is exhibited. Have fun locating my new photo.   ...After all, this is all about the Phantasm...   Until next time...

       Timeline:  Present  Dear mother,  10 years...  ...how they passed us by. In a blink, in a sharp gasp, in a teardrop, we left them behind us and reshaped them as memories (at least, I did). Separated in realities that were handed to us, we slowly got used to being apart. Initially, it felt like an overture played lento. I had so many moments when I felt you lurking in the shadows to reach for me. As if your spectre was still orbiting around me, as if you were finally through with the physical agony of passing away yet still not ready to let me go. Just like you had stated on a cold, late winter, morning when you looked at me with eyes filled with maternal compassion,    "I fear for you".    We were tired beyond description. You were dying while dad was defeating death. Those last three months were emotionally, physically and mentally devastating for both of us. You were postponing your death and I was postponing my sadness, embodying a courage & strength cocktail too heavy for the 17 years on my shoulders. I hugged you tight, knowing you were finally fully aware of my illness, the complexity of my physicality, the fact that you disregarded it all throughout our togetherness. In your embrace, I comprehended that you foresaw my future -- these last five years; The coming darkness that was supposed to be my light. You knew that I was not going to live a life that didn't belong to me... that time was so near until we were physically apart until a later the whenebaouts of which was unknown to us... and that you were too late to protect me from what was coming.  Hence, you feared for which my response was, "Do not".  Then, you cupped my cheeks in your withering, chemotherapied hands, looked in my eyes so deep that I still feel that final warmth you sealed into me even to this day. You did the only thing you could; Passed the final drops of life left in your veins onto me. Your last present to the being you created from your very own.  Years later, dad told me that while you were by his recuperating side in the hospital right after his by-pass, you had said, "I am too late for our child. We should save you because she will need you."  Weeks after my father's leaving the hospital, my footsteps echoed in the hygienical corridors once more. This time for you... My belated hopes accompanying me, I entered your room full of family friends, approached by your side and planted a light kiss on your forehead as I whispered, "Mother..."  ...you murmured, "Who is this?". I closed my eyes briefly. People in the room turned away, trying to hide their tears penetrating the moment. I let you know who I was... then... you smiled. After a short while, I rested my cheek against yours and murmured, "I love you". A murmur that flourished forth from my very soul.  And you said, "I love you too, my amber."  Those were the last things we said to each other. Lost things never to be returned... In that final moment of our togetherness, we did not bid each other farewell. And mother... I still haven't uttered the words, "I love you" to anybody. Many variations, I formed and sounded... yet never those three words together.  I simply couldn't. As if saying those three words together to somebody else would be a betrayal to that moment. As if those words belonged to  our  moment.  Today is the tenth Mother's Day since you're gone. And I am writing this letter to let you know that I am ready now. To let go... to let go of those moments that haunted me occasionally for 10 years. I choose to be left with all the memories that had made us, us; The continuous laughter we had shared... your warm chest, my harbor against the tempest... our Friday escapades... our afternoon talks over the rims of our coffee mugs... the way you childishly traced back your wet locks away from your face when we were swimming... the way my father looked at you with the pride of having a woman such as yourself in his arm whenever you two left the house for a night out... I will never ever forget that look which made me realize the wonder of being a pair... a beautiful pair... and I do hope, mother, that one day, I will also be able to cause the man I love to look at me with such pride as he takes up my arm and leads me out of our house... our pizza days...  Pretty Woman  sessions... our walks on the beach, in the forest... our summer nights in the verandah... our Sunday mornings...  And all that I learned from you; Your zeal towards living... the beauty, the charm you emitted to your surroundings... your determination through bad times... your radiance through good times... your lively mentality... your ability to say "no" to something that didn't fit you... your creativity... your courage to challenge the possibilities... your courage to  produce  possibilities when they are least expected... your positivity... your being a powerful survivor in a man's world without casting your femininity aside...  Although I have happened to look more like my dad in these years, I am delighted to be your reflection in the details instead of the overall appearance. I have  your  shoulders,  your  waistline,  your  expressions in my eyes. That is why whenever I look in the mirror, I can see  you  through my gaze...  ...and that is why although the lento has long turned allegro, you will always be with me.  I could have never been more proud of being your daughter as I am today.  Your amber loves you eternally.  Happy Mother's Day.

       Timeline:  Present  As of today your author has turned a Team Leader of Ponderland's forming Humanity's Team. Solara had some stories to share with me, indeed. Especially her latest experiences at  The Hague - International City of Peace  truly captured my attention which, as you already know, was quite dissected yesterday. Then again, her contagious enthusiasm quickly washed my aforementioned indifference and I soon found myself in the heart of founding Ponderland's Humanity's Team alongside Sol (having a good night's sleep yesterday also helped a great deal). What can I say? She just knows how to hit the bullseye of the leader in me.  "What is the Humanity's Team?" one may ask.  It can be described as an international movement currently parented by The Conversations with God Foundation but is planned to be a non-profit and separate organization by 2006. It is the actual response to the wonder,  "I have been following the  Conversations with God  series and they have changed my life. Now what can I do about it?" . It is a roof that will house individuals who live to make a change in the world (and start doing it by changing themselves), who want to flourish and progress continuously throughout their Odyssey, who want to share their experiences and be supported in a closely-connected  group  family that is purely based on understanding and love regardless of religion, race, sexual orientation they belong. It is not a new religion! It is a totally new approach towards religion, rather... and God and above all Life...  ...Life which is the most precious gift we are presented with. Through living lies the message of Spirituality... Through living lies the expression of one's true self.  And "your message is your life,  lived " is Humanity's Team motto. It is "a civil rights movement for the soul". It aims to create a "world in which humanity truly experiences unity and oneness". Its mission is to "renew and restore our connection with the creator, the powers that be, Fate or whatever you name it  and  with each other".  I am very proud to be a part of this great support and also excited by the fact that I have this space of transparency wherein all my efforts to make a change as my life collides with the Humanity's Team shall be recorded (yet another bliss of being a blogger). I am honored to feel this loved and this embraced among a group of peoples who are as willing to take a step further to enrich the experience of "living" through neverending self discovery and acceptance.  We are all so unique and totally capable of making this world a beautiful,  peace ful place. All we need is to take a baby step towards it. You can also share this incredible experience by becoming a part of the Humanity's Team which is open and welcoming to each and every one. Simply click  urlLink here  to find out more and what you can do about it.  There are so many things to be done. First and foremost, I need to have a business card. This is the classy part and all about the "Here... take my card" trivia. Then, we will be trying to find a publisher while I start translating  New Revelations: A Conversation with God  into my mother language. It is still not on the market here in Ponderland. On Tuesday, Sol and I will be going to pay a visit to the art center that will be sponsoring and organizing N.D. Walsch's visit to Ponderland. It seems that we will not be "shoulder deep" in arranging this visit at all. Yet, we will be so in the coming days, possibly towards Fall since Sol is planning to host the next country coordinators meeting here in November.  Still, before that we have to prepare the Humanity's Team brochures that will be presented to the guests during N.D. Walsch's conference. That conference will be very important in the name of advertising, for certain. We also need to build a website and turn Sol's house (where I will be spending most of my time from this point on. May I get a hurray for leaving the asylum behind, please?) into our counseling office. Amidst all these will be the lookout for a publisher and my translating Walsch's unpublished books.  I feel so alive and in tune with myself at last! Can you tell?

I called to check if you're available on Friday.  Aura:  I have an appointment in the morning but I'm free in the afternoon. Why?  Sol:  Great! I really really need to see you.  Aura:  Is everything alright, Sol?  Sol:  Oh so many things have...  Aura:  I got that part, love. Good or bad?  Sol:  Definitely good! Alright, we're seeing each other on Friday, then. Well... looks like we'll be seeing a lot of each other from now on.  Aura:  Sorry.. I.. can't quite catch your drift, Sol.  Sol:  I'll tell you all about it on Friday.  Aura:  Sure. See you then.  Sol:  Bye.  ~ Friday , 8:13 am   Sol:  Hi, dear!  Aura:  Oh...huh...ah...mmm...  Sol:  Oh did I wake you up?  Aura:  Uh... no.. *checks the clock and falls back on the pillow*..  Sol:  Calling to let you know I have patients all day. I can only leave the hospital around 6 pm. Will that be a problem for you?  Aura:  Sure... I mean... *yawns slightly*... No, that's fine.  Sol:  Great then. You know this is really really urgent. I just have to see you ASAP.  Aura:  If you are trying to knock me out with curiosity, Sol, you already did.  Sol:  You see, I don't want to call you unless something important happens simply because we keep repeating the same pattern.   Aura:  *thinks she hears her munching something* Do we?  Sol:  Mmm... And... *gulps* We just keep running around in circles in our conversation. But this time we're breaking the cycle, dear! We'll be seeing each other a lot, I'm telling you.  Aura:  Shall we get back to doing that at 6 pm, then?  Sol:  Ok ok! Get back to your sleep. See you then, bye!  Aura:  By(yawn)e...  ~ Friday , Now.  Chances are:  Solara is moving to back to our neighborhood (For newcomers, Solara, one of my closest friends, and I had lived in the same district for 5 years before she decided to move -on-).  Solara is moving back to our neighborhood and wants me to help her with the process (explains why we'll be seeing each other a lot).  Solara is moving back to our neighborhood, wants me to help her with the process and I feel indifferent.  Solara is getting married. (which practically means she found herself in a flaring affair in the last 4 months we haven't seen each other which implies I will bitch about being the last to know about it.)  Solara is getting married and wants me to be her maiden-of-honor (explains why we'll be seeing each other a lot from now on).  Solara is getting married, wants me to be her maiden-of-honor and I feel indifferent.  Solara has a new boyfriend.  Solara has a new boyfriend, has told him about me and the boyfriend wants to meet me (they always do. Like that's not enough, her boyfriends always belong to the I-have-a-best-friend-you'll-love-and-once-you-do-that-I'll-guarantee-4-months-of-headache-free-shag-with-my-girlfriend-while-we-double-date-happily-ever-after prototype).  Solara has a new boyfriend, has told him about me, he wants to meet me and I feel indifferent.  Solara has finally gained a high rank in the  urlLink Humanity's Team .  Solara has finally gained a high rank in the Humanity's Team, told them about me and they want me to join them.  Solara has finally gained a high rank in the Humanity's Team, told them about me, they want me to join them and I feel indifferent (I've checked to find out that she is now the Interim Coordinator of this country! -- Omit the rest. This must be it).  As of today, I feel disconnected and cranky (if you still can't tell). I haven't had a proper sleep for the last two days. My eyes are burning with restlessness and visualizing myself in the middle of a group who are shoulder-deep in organizing N.D. Walsch's visit early this summer doesn't click at the moment. I want nothing but to curl in one corner and have a "summer sleep"!  It seems writing will not do, either.  Just a few thank yous and I'm done for today:  Thank you for Vermond. It sure looks serene. I was going to reply to it properly but looks like Yahoo's compose section is having an anti-Aura day. Hopefully, it will be resolved tomorrow.  Thank you for the beautiful short poem. For some reason, it made my eyes fill with tears and added  fragile  to my list of current mood adjectives.  You two know yourselves.  Until later.

       Timeline:  Present (Perfect)  These days, I truly wish that I would receive a letter from an unknown relative's attorney one morning saying, since he had had no close relatives, he left all his property worth a few million dollars to me upon his death. Why, is it so impossible? Angel had been just recently telling me that one of her friends experienced just that! Although the amount she received was lacking some of my dreamy zeros, it was still around 100.000 dollars and they were all astounded because she probably had seen this woman who was living in the States once or twice at most.  I will admit that it was sheer envy that caused my heart's pounding upon hearing this news no matter how maturely I responded to it (Truly amazing! I wish her all the best...).  100.000 dollars would give me my life + hopes back. And some more.  It is unfortunate that I have (more than) everything ready to make a start and all that I have been working and praying for is a reasonable amount of money to fund it. If only I didn't do anything to achieve it. Then, I would bury myself in self-pity and suffer gladly. Putting aside pride (actually trashing my pride), I knocked every possible door (including relatives and old family acquaintances I vowed not to see any longer), asking for a little aid on the financial side in vain.  For some reason, "At least, I tried" has been a thought that doesn't make anything easier lately.  Anyway, casting this aside, I've happened to marvel at the thought that there is so much in the world to see and ruminate that we have so little time. If only I was a sensitive water sign like Pisces or Cancer or a practical earth sign like Capricorn or Virgo. Enduring all these could have been much easier.  But I am very much a Fire. The Sagittarius infernoes freely in my veins.  Being the natural vagabond she is, she does not listen to all my rational responses to her cravings and longings. She loathes the fact that I live with a lunatic family. She despises the immobility I am causing her to go through. Although the dominant Aura has left the stage behind for "good", she never will, that much I know.  She is the adventurous Victoria's Secret model who travels to Rome for a shoot by the Trevi Fountain before catching the plane for New York Fashion Days.  She is the lunar actress who flashes a smile at the cameras clad in a barely there Valentino while she walks swiftly on the red carpet towards the Academy Awards.  She is the scandalous diva who, upon her sold-out performance at Wimbley, is spotted leaving The Gardening Club at Covert Garden totally inebriated among a bunch of Chippendales.  She is a free spirit and keeps aiming her bow at me with her greedy need to explore, learn, experience and leave behind. She will never be tamed, never be satisfied until she makes a change, never be fulfilled until she sees everything she is curious to see and meets the hypothetical thousands whom, according to her, she is destined to meet. For her, there is no mountain too high, no planet too far.   The earth is her playground and she is dying to play it her way. She wants to be an old lady who has thousands of stories to share with her neighbors, albums of countless moments captured to share with her friends and no matter how old she will be, she will never be an elder who derives her life energy from simply watching her grandchildren grow up. Because no matter how old she gets, there still will be a corner of the globe not seen or a topic uncovered (thankfully, there will be no concept such as grandchildren anyway so that she won't have to fit in this simile).  She is giving me the bliss and since I cannot ease her, giving me the headache simultaneously!  Casting that aside,  urlLink this place  has been my recent obsession. Since my best friend and I have plans (dreams, rather? or high hopes?) to move to New Zealand as we go through our holy 30s, I am being further called by the sirens of this bay in Tasmania. I muse to leave my footprints on those endless shores, sleep under those clear dark skies where the constellations seem only a breath away, listen to the symphony of the wave crashes as they feed my sense of freedom, watch the iridal of horizons as I sit in the Lodge while the sun sets...  Casting that aside, now that my Granny and uncle got the government money they receive every three months, I was hoping that for the next 2 months we were going to be financially a little better off than the usual. However, they decided to buy a brand new TV!   I repeat. A brand new TV! (Nah it still doesn't make sense)  Like we have the luxury to throw money away for a leisure such as this one, they even already paid for it!  I repeat. They even already pai... (Tsk!)  Here I (alright, dad and I! I may have eluded him lately but I can't go as far as being unfair) am, working and hoping my cute behind off to make ends meet and they go buy a darn new TV!!!!!!!!   I tried my best to hide the devastation I felt upon being fed by this news last night. It is to no avail trying to put some sense into these mindless beings and make them quit the idea. They have their own reality and are deaf to everything else but...  ...what the hell are we gonna do for the next 3 months now that our most precious reserve is drained?  Why can't I draw the blanket over my head and simply vanish? Now  that 's one question I  cannot  cast aside!   (What?! Taj Mahal?? Shut the shag up, Sagittarius!!)

       Timeline:  Present  If there is one attitude in life that I despise, it is "As you wish" mode. It sends extreme apathy my way and apathy is one thing I cannot bear when it is directed towards me. Negativity, I can take. Positivity, whatever. Yet apathy...  ...it is very much like "grey" in life. Those who know me personally, having heard a statement resembling something like "It is either black or white for me. I don't buy grey!" more than once from me, are possibly nodding solemnly at the moment. I love my weaknesses, thank you. I have no intention to be perfect, either. Hence, this is one of those traits that makes me, me.  What happens when I am faced with the aforementioned color? Something very much like the bull snorting as it comes across "red". Wave "grey" in front of my face and run away if your life is precious since what you are about to face will range somewhere between a storm and a tempest.  I am involved with a business where I am on a one-on-one basis with individuals. However, I still wonder how I am going to deal with those natural instincts that have been a part of me for all my life. You can see me running from one spot to another, amidst one crowd or another, laughing merrily from one night to another until...  ...there comes a time, I vanish!  If you attempt to call, I will not pick up the phone. If you attempt to knock on my door, I will not answer. It is what I refer to as the "shell mood" because it is very much like a tortoise retreating into its shell and hiding itself from the world and no matter what you do, it only comes out when it chooses to. During times like these, I care about nobody but myself. I do not even turn to those who are closest to me. If I have a boyfriend, he usually goes crazy and truthfully I do not give a hoot. Acquaintances start worrying about me while close friends realize there is a "do not disturb" alert dangling at my doorstep. Family try to ask me "what the problem is" and I would usually snap back until they realize it doesn't help and start snapping back (such "tolerant" is the family across a matter of the soul).  This is my recuperating period. The period I desperately need because I differ from usual entities with my ability to be truly "empathetic" (and am nicknamed after the Rogue of X-Men likewise because I almost "take in" a part of the other party with my empathy, feeling their agony as they feel it, experiencing their anxiety alongside them, sharing their joy just as excited). I do not say "I have empathy" for the sake of sounding "sympathetic" but because I really do have the darn thing.   Shortly, under normal circumstances, I shower people in spirituality, support and a tasteful dose of Love until they either start retching or feeling abnormally refreshed.  Yet, being like a sponge when it comes to other people's feelings and/or moods, lending them an ear freely, offering them a ready hand when they need it, suddenly and abruptly wears me out.  This is one of those moments. I am flowing into my "shell mood". What is worse, Solara is irritating me beyond reason with her "bossy busyness" thanks to her being the Country Coordinator of HT Ponderland and shrugging at me when I say I cannot make it to a certain event, for instance (While the actual reason I cannot make it to that certain event is... Let us give the correct answer collectively: BECAUSE I'M BROKE!).  Sure love! Why bother with the mood swings of an old friend when you are knee-deep in spiritual activism and finally have a boyfriend after 4 years?  Somebody give me my Charon back and leave us in a deserted island for a  week  month, please? If that very somebody can give me a male with Charon's mind, a passionate lover's heart, Spike (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer)'s character and Victor Webster's looks, that would be double neat for I would most likely never return, solving jigsaw puzzles (!?), watching stars, dusks and sunsets, laughing the days away, swimming, hunting, diving, fishing, fighting, making love and, overall, living happily ever after.  How "grey" is that!?

       Timeline:  Present   What blasphemy when Love is buried in pseudo-silence; A manipulative muteness disguised as tranquility!  Alas, it is * The Devil 's rotten chains, You attempt to knit my veins with. When it is nothing but your invariant intoxication,  That has held * The Sun 's fire unlit!     Seek a *Snow Queen to take your hand that bears the* Knight of Swords'  arms! All that shall take for the edelweiss to flourish, Lies in the bravery of a man to imbibe   me   into his   self  ...  ...and THEN become the most   self -centered  champion of the Universe!  The benumbed mermaid hits the shore; Only the first to find her lips for a mouth to mouth  Shall listen to her breathing underwater again.     Glossary :    *The Devil:  Within the classic Raider-Whyte tarot, Devil is depicted perched on his throne while a female and male are seen chained to each other as they stand on each side of this throne. The card shows that we are playing with fire and have to be as careful as hell (!) not to burn our fingers in the process. On a deeper level it means that the background of the question brings us into contact with our own shadow side.   *The Sun:  The Sun card (also) stands for the illuminating powers of the conscious mind with which we achieve clarity and overcome problems, annoyances, and uncanny fears. It is additionally a symbol of youthful freshness and the feeling of being reborn. On a deeper level, it challenges us to overcome the darkness in ourselves, expand our sunlike nature, and free our "darkened" brother or sister and bring them into the light.   *Knight of Swords:  Stands for an atmosphere of frost, stridency, deceitfulness, discord, and disputes, which can cloud an area of life that has been experienced as pleasant until now. Although the cooling down that he represents can also bring an environment of clarity and sober perception with it, we usually experience this card as the negative side of the air element that it represents. This means cool aloofness, harsh conflicts, shrewdness, biting ridicule, and bitter irony. The Knight is therefore frequently the herald of separations, discord, razor-sharp arguments, and deliberate cruelties.   *Snow Queen:  This is a tale made up of 7 stories and is adapted by Hans Christian Andersen based on the myth of the Snow Queen. According to the story, the fairy known as the Snow Queen lives atop the highest peaks of Alps and is renown for her irresistible beauty. Many search for her and those few who find her to declare their devotion are thrown out into the abyss by her goblin guards. One day, a chamois hunter reaches the castle and upon seeing her, simply kneels and remains silent across her beauty. The Queen looks back and waits for him to disclose his love so that the guards could throw him out. Yet, he never speaks and in time, the Queen finds herself falling for this young and handsome hunter. However, the goblins realize the danger and charge the hunter before they throw him out. The Queen watches the scene from a window and her icy heart melts as she turns into a plain woman. A tear drops from her eye, the first she has ever shed. And the Snow Queen's tear falls on to a stone where it turns into a little silvery star.   This happens to be the first edelweiss ... the flower that grows only on the highest, most inaccessible peaks in the Alps, on the edge of the abyss and precipice...  ~This is the second (the first being  urlLink House of Cards ) of a set of heavily riddled Tarot poems. The interpretation of the cards are from  urlLink Mystic Games  as before.

       Timeline:  Present Perfect  Dearest N.,   As Solara has recently informed you, here I am to give you a brief summary as to what HT Ponderland has been up to and will be focusing in the coming days. We had our first meeting last Tuesday and to our delight the wavelength shared was most promising.    We started the meeting with introducing ourselves briefly and moved on to explaining how our vision will be actualized on a weekly basis, ie. the amazing process of Study and Emotional Support Groups. We know that, although they are covered as to-the-point as possible, these groups are best comprehended via experience so in the coming days (hopefully before the next meeting which is scheduled for July 8th) we will be concentrating on launching our first groups.   Next came our projects. Currently, we are pursuing to achieve the following goals:   1) Finding equipment and scheduling for a monthly tele-conference session with Neale.   2) Translating "First Things First", "Taking The First Step" (New Spirituality Study Groups) and "Living the New" (NS Emotional Support Groups) standard documents.   3) Having come across a group who is so enthusiastic and excited about cooperating with us and whose focus is indigo children, we are planning to order Neale's film INDIGO and possibly have it as a part of our Study Group material as well as watching it with various groups interested. Moreover, we will try to make INDIGO a part of the Ponderland International Film Festival on the long run. That is, if we can come to an agreement with its producers and the organizators of the festival here in our city.   4) Also we are still searching for a publishing company who will agree to publishing   Tomorrow's God   in Ponderland.   5) Last but not the least, we are after having a weekly, one-hour radio show where we will be introducing NS material and discuss it "on air".   After introducing these projects, we focused on connecting on a personal basis and did our best to give everyone a chance to disclose what they feel about HT in general and what they are willing to do. During this period, our family gave us feedback on various subjects discussed during the meeting. For instance, thanks to Mr. Melon, we have the option of moving into the "heart of the city" where we will establish HT Ponderland's "Headquarters".   The meeting came to an end with a surprise from Solara which was a bottle of champagne to celebrate HT Ponderland's debut!   We will keep you updated on our doings and I also want to thank you for your interest in our proposal concerning HT Worldwide Management Email Group. I am extremely excited about it as well. Is it possible for you to start the group, then? We'd be grateful if you did.   Together with  Love ,   Aura Mars Humanity's Team Ponderland Project Director

       Timeline:  Present  I spent the weekend over at Solara's trying to contact those who had filled out the questionnaire but we could not reach via email. It is a surprising experience to hear the enthusiasm in people's voices. If I had had the slightest of doubt concerning our mission previously, it vanished throughout Saturday. Some told us that they would not be able to make it to the meeting tomorrow yet were extremely into it as they stressed that they definitely would attend next week.  One interesting "coincidence" was formed via an event held last week. Solara got an invitation to a conference concerning Indigo children (a term referred to children with above average IQ and tend to be hyperactive. Unfortunately, here in Ponderland, these children are mostly maldiagnosed with "hyperactivity" and are prescribed a drug that will ease the symptoms. Worse, Ministry of Health secretly encourages this process so that the drug sales are reinforced. Sacrilege!) and, although she could not go to the conference, thought we could give the guy a call since Neale has a movie named  urlLink Indigo . It is also centered around an indigo child and we thought the guy would be interested...  ...well we could not find the guy but we found so much more. We were given the number of the woman who organized this event and she was utterly excited to hear from us. She told us that she was at Neale's event and she could not believe she missed Humanity's Team stand. She went on by explaining that she had an office in the heart of the city, that their organization were centered around meditation and yoga classes. They were inclined to set up an association yet they did not have a "core group" to establish it. She concluded that we should have a meeting and discuss further since she would be delighted to work with us.  Hence, HT Ponderland's first meeting is tomorrow with topics to be discussed such as:  ~ Launching Study and Emotional Support Groups. ~ Purchase of  Indigo  and possibly arranging its screening during International Film Festival next year. ~ Ordering CwG: Guidebook and CwG: ReMinder Cards. ~ Translating regular documents like "First Things First", "How To Form an Emotional Support Group?" and "Establishing Study Groups". ~ What each member could do within Humanity's Team structure.  And some more... Off to paying a visit to the salon. I need to get a new hair cut as well as a pedicure.  Another reason to dislike summer when one is not a shabby freelance translator anymore.

       Timeline:  Present  Finally, the time had arrived for me to see Troy last night. I have this tendency to approach big budget movies that are surrounded by gigantic promotional campaigns, belatedly. When the craze subsides somewhat, it is much easier to watch the film on a more personal level and away from the immense trivia around it.  As an avid devotee of Greek Mythology, Troy did not impress me at all... and as a fan of Homer who is the major writer who fueled my love for Hellenistic theology, I totally disfavored it. In the name of making it somewhere between a battle and Brad Pitt movie, the producers disregarded many of the key elements that actually make the Trojan War and Iliad what it is.  Here are the things that I personally did not like about Troy. If you haven't seen the movie and wish to do so, I recommend that you read The Trojan Blasphemy afterwards since it will include spoilers:  ~ To begin with, Iliad is a story backgrounded heavily by Paris and Helen as much as Achilles, one of the  many  heroes that are present within the epic poem. Actualy, I take both Iliad and Odyssey as a legend that, as a whole, tells the story of   Odysseus   no matter how the story shifts from him towards different personalities now and then to enhance its multipersonally rich texture.  ~ Achilles is the mightiest and most skillful of warriors at his time and that part is for certain. However, he is nowhere near the cocky, self-centered, self-dependent, bad boy personality that is depicted in the movie. The anguish surrounding Achilles is not reflected thoroughly in the movie at all and is only briefly touched by the scene where Priam of Troy sneaks into his tent and begs for his son's corpse. In truth, Achilles is a personality whose miserable dilemma lies in the fact that he originally chooses to live a short and glorious life as opposed to his other option of a long and blase life. Achilles knows that he must ultimately die in the heat of battle and gain great fame for doing so. This was attempted to be reflected via a short intercourse with his mother but I found it extremely shallow since it lacked throughout the rest of the movie until the Priam scene arrived.  ~ Achilles eventually returns to fight on the side of the Algives, but not because of anything Agamemnon offers to him in order to get him to return to the fighting. Achilles' best friend and essential "soul-mate", Patroclus, is slain at the hands of the mighty Hector of Troy. In that sense, Patroclus has nothing to do with the "cousin figure" in the movie, either. The love that binds these two is much stronger than blood.  ~ Just like Patroclus, Briseis is also ill-depicted for she is not of Trojan nobility but the slave of Achilles. When Agamemnon seizes Briseis, Achilles feels insulted and retreats to his tent, only to leave it after Patroclus' death.  ~ Paris. One of the most beautiful men of his time (and in this sense, I find Brad Pitt more suitable for the role than no-matter-how-he-acts-always-ends-up-looking-elfin Orlando Bloom) until he is killed by the arrows of Philoctetes. It is true that during the course of the Trojan war Paris acts more like a cowardly tyrant who is totally apathetic of the war going on once his duel with Menelaus is over. During the pace of this challenge, Paris does not "back off cowardly" from this fight as in the movie but is rather stripped from it by Aphrodite herself as she portals him to her divine chambers and enchants him with a spell that would cause him to long for Helen's flesh constantly. It is due to this spell that Paris falls into the hands of indifference for long.  ~ The Olympian Gods play a major role in the Trojan war as much as the heroes themselves since Gods  actively participate  in it alongside them. The approach of the Gods towards the Trojan War is rooted in the divine beauty contest that was held before the war itself. The three Goddesses Athena, Hera and Aphrodite cannot come to terms regarding the matter about who owned the golden apple inscribed with the phrase  'for the fairiest' . Hence, instructed by Zeus, they seek the opinion of Paris (who is naught but a shepherd legendary for his handsomeness back then. As prophesied to his parents Priam and Hekabe, the younger of their sons is destined to be the cause of Troy's fall. Hence, they take and leave baby Paris at Mount Ida where he is found and raised by a shepherd). Paris, having listened to each Goddess' personal prize in return of his choice, accepts Aphrodite's offer which is the love of the most beautiful female mortal alive. Hence, Hera and Athena take the side of Algives during the battle while Zeus, Aphrodite, Apollo and Ares remain on the Trojans' side.  ~ Paris visits Troy for the first time after the divine beauty contest, is recognized by his sister Kassandra and is also welcomed by his father Priam wholeheartedly. When he visits Sparda as the Prince of Troy, he comes across King's wife Helen who happens to be the aforementioned most beautiful woman alive. Hence, the two fall in love almost immediately and escape Troy together. It is this background that truly leads to Iliad's irony since both Helen and Paris seem to be the victims of Aphrodite, the former with her "terrible" beauty, the latter with the continuous craving for this beauty promised to him by the Goddess.  ~ The most solid depictions in the movie were that of Priam, Hector and Andromache.  ~ The doom of Achilles is shaped when he slays Hector and ties his corpse to his chariot to drag him behind as he rides around the walls of Troy thrice. This disrespect towards death draws the wrath of Apollo (not because Achilles beheads some statue of his as seen in the movie) who has only interfered once with the pace of the war up until that point. When Paris finally comes to his senses and joins the battle, it is Apollo who directs the arrow he shoots and causes it to plunge deep into the only point Achilles can be wounded, namely his heel.    PSone:  As one can tell, I am very critical about mythological films (one of my all time favorites is a very old one named 'Clash of the Titans') and cannot stand any reformation in the name of movie adaptations when it comes to Hellenistic legends.  PStwo:  I am having problems with my email, again. If any of you have emailed me recently and received no response, the reason is technical rather than personal.

       Timeline:  Present  For all the 27 years that have passed me by, I have never dreamed a dream such as the one that kept going on last night. Not only the content was totally brand new to me but also the dream was one of those that "continued". I do not know whether there are others who have experienced this before yet this is a dream sequence that does not let you go even if you wake up amidst it. You blink open your eyes and as soon as you are back in the caress of Morpheus, it goes on from where you left it off.  Today I was hoping to compose the new chapter of the Incubus storyline. However, he decided to pull a trick on me which lead to my complete loss of words if not freeze of creative juices when morning stroke.  First in 27 years, Ladies and Gentlemen, I dreamed myself as married.  I repeat,  married !  The little wings of Apollo which comes attached to the ankles of every Sagittarius at birth seem to need a major repair... or upgrade! Because my Incubus was very much wearing 21st century clothing this time (a light colored tank top revealing a broad chest and strong arms and matching sweatpants over long, powerful legs) and holding me close to his chest, kissing me most...  ...tenderly.  It sure was "in his kiss" and it was striking...  ...and his being not a stranger anymore, startled me beyond reason.  For all my life, I never "dreamed" about that kind of bond unless, casually, the subject leaned towards that direction during intimate conversations with friends. I am still a child at heart, free and merry as a robin and I ended one or two relationships in the past simply because the issue of marriage was brought into the relationship too soon.  But this, ladies and gentlemen, felt so.... different.... and so unexpected that, (t)his twist knocked the breath off me.  I could feel in his carress and in his kiss that he was... holding me as if I would slip through his arms...  ...and I was going to slip through his arms the instant he came into my dreams again, for certain...  Thus, there we were, husband and wife... his presence before me as the man I am bound to no matter how free I may be... Caressing me, he held my hands and took us out of what seems to be a bedroom and out into a gloomy afternoon.  Wrapping an arm around my shoulder, he pressed me close to his hovering figure as we walked out into what seems like a patio... and as the first thunder was heard in the distance, my arms were around his waist, my nose brushing under his chin... harbored in a hug which turned me into the piece of a jigsaw puzzle which found its place...  Husband?  Wife?  Hence what I was placed at, ladies and gentlemen, was not a puzzle of flesh, this time...  ...but a puzzle of the heart!  And just when I thought I was abandoned into safety, he dungeoned me in perplexity.

       Timeline:  (Past) Present (Future)  "The people of every country think I condone the war they are fighting, and condemn the war that their opponent is fighting.  The people of every nation believe they have “God on their side.”  Every cause assumes the same thing.  Indeed, every person feels the same thing—or at least hopes it is true whenever any decision or choice is made.  And do you know why all creatures believe God is on their side?   Because I am .  And all creatures have an intuitive knowing of this.  This is just another way of saying,  'Your will for you is My will for you.'   And that is just another way of saying, I have given you all free will.  There is no free will if to exercise it in certain ways produces punishment.  That makes a mockery of free will and renders it counterfeit.  So with regard to abortion or war, buying that car or marrying that person, having sex or not having sex, ‘doing your duty’ or not ‘doing your duty,’ there is no such thing as right and wrong, and I have no preference in the matter.  You are all in the process of defining yourselves.  Every act is an act of self-definition.  If you are pleased with how you have created yourself, if it serves you, you will continue doing so in that way.  If you are not, you will stop.

       Timeline:  Present   *This song dates from the 19th or 20th Egyptian dynasty (ca. 1300-1100 B.C.E.). It was found written in hieroglyphics on a vase and was translated into English by Michael V. Fox.*    This love is as good As oil and honey to the throat, As linen to the body, As fine garments to the gods, As incense to worshippers when they enter in, As the little seal-ring to my finger.  It is like a ripe pear in a man's hand. It is like the dates we mix with wine. It is like the seeds the baker adds to bread.  We will be together even when old age comes.  And the days in between Will be food set before us, Dates and honey, bread and wine.   I respect one's silence and distance when one needs them. And I know when to seal my lips and dreams... For only respect and understanding of a male's need for privacy might lead a woman back to that moment of blissful togetherness.    Here... Take this Lotus and meet me by the Nile at midnight.

       Timeline:  Present Perfect   Sol:  So how did you find it here in Ponderland?  Neale:   [softly]  Oh wonderful wonderful... It is far from what I expected. It is so different.  Aura:   *crossing her legs*  In what sense?  Neale:  This is a very big city, full of people from different ethnic backgrounds and what we will be trying to implement in the world, you guys have been doing in ages. Tolerance and understanding towards indivisual beliefs. I do not count the eastern regions in.  Aura:  You better. What we have here is thanks to the jet-set and the financially above average population dominating the city. The story is so very different when it comes to central and eastern regions.    Neale:  ...What surprises me is that you people can speak English so well. You for instance..  [turns to Aura]  ..Where are you from?  Aura:   *smiling softly*  The very heart of this city.  Neale:  You don't sound like it... you sound more like someone from Milwaukee. How come?  Aura:   *repeats her mastered response like a parrot*  Perhaps because I have been dealing with English ever since I was 10?.. and that I have had many foreign friends?.. and that I studied English Literature at University? and perhaps because I write a lot in English? And I do it online? And some of my writings emit New Spirituality? *winks*  Neale:   [leaning forward]  So you are our online representative, I see.  Aura:  I can only hope.    (N.D. Walsch now knows about Phantasmemoria. We are spiritually famous)     Neale:  .. and what are your short-term plans? [turning to the waitress who serves his breakfast] Thank you.  Aura:  What we will be focusing after this conference is having Tomorrow's God published in Ponderland. You are aware of the fact that you are famous for the Conversations with God Trilogy and neither New Revelations nor Tomorrow's God are published here, aren't you?  Neale:   [nods as he munches a mouthful of pear]  Aura:  *continues*  If they were the sentence, Tomorrow's God will be like the period at the end of that meaningful statement. That and since it not only defines a new approach towards spirituality but also outlines what and why Humanity's Team is. So people will have a better understanding of what we are about.    Neale:  ...careful?  Aura:  Yes, Neale. This will be a challenging opportunity for us to find synonyms to the concept of God.  Neale:   [chuckles and leans back]  Good. The only part I advise you to be careful about would be using too many synonyms for the concept of God so that people will feel deceived once they are within the family. Avoid misleading people so that they will not come up and say, "But this wasn't what you were talking about at first place".  Aura:  *leans her elbows on the table* What I am trying to say is, Neale, that no matter how much people  seem  to be obsessed with God, they are prejudiced towards hearing the word God. Especially in this country, the interest we will receive from people if we wear shirts printed "I'm God" on the front, will be in the form of continuous harassment. This is a country whose beliefs and traditions are based on the teachings of Islam... and no matter how extremely modern Ponderland seems, people would react much more brutally than your average Christian community.  *raises a hand when she sees Neale parting his lips*  Let me finish, please?  Neale:   [nods with a smile]  Go on kiddo.  Aura:  We will not be deceiving people at all. We may say it is Love, we may say it is utmost understanding and respect, we may say it is the collective consciousness of the Universe, we may say it is self-creation yet no matter how we name it, once people have the space to experience what we are talking about, sooner or later they will understand what it really is. We will not be tricking them into a belief system, we will simply be giving them the freedom to decide for themselves. Let's take you, for instance, and your first conversation with God. How long did it take for you to finally believe that it came from the sum of all experiences (there you go, another simile for God) instead of some twisted, perverted illusion of your mind? Before you experienced for yourself, would you believe such a thing would be possible if someone came up to you 20 years ago and went, "Hey ol' fella! There's no thing called Fate, you created the filth you are in and God doesn't care whether you like Her or not. God simply wishes what you wish for yourself and nothing more as It loves you unconditionally... oh and by the way, there's no such thing called Heaven, Hell or Satan, aside from the Hell from an all-original Heaven you already created and are living in. They are just mythologies you made up for yourself so that you can turn the concept of divinity into turntable RP. So relax will ya"?  Neale:  You talk...  Aura:  ...And think.  Neale:  That was a very good point, by the way. Alright, let me tell you something, then...   (We had a laugh out of that yet the rest of the conversation, I will keep to myself. It is a unique experience the details of which shall be remembered in my privacy. Suffice to say, it went on and turned out to be an in depth and special correspondence through which, thanks to Love, we always found a middle way and gave and learned a lot from each other)

       Timeline:  Present Perfect     -The mobile resting on the bedside table starts flashing abruptly as it begins a monotonous beep that crescendoes. A thin and pale arm appears from beneath the blanket and bumps clumsily on the mobile which rolls over and hits the floor, still beeping stubbornly.-      Aura:   *with a coarse murmur*  ...Shut up, I got it!

Aura:  Just got on the bus. On my way to the hotel.   Sol:  Where do I pick you up?   Aura:  You don't. Let's meet at the hotel.   Sol:  'kay. See you there.

The clock reads 8:34 am.     Sol:   [accompanied by a beautiful, dark haired girl]  Hey...   Aura:   *gets up and gives Sol a hug*    Sol:  This is Virgo, hun. Virgo this is Aura.   Virgo:  Nice to meet you.   Aura:   *smiling*  Sol told a lot about you. It's like I've known you already.   Virgo:   [sitting on a chair next to Aura]  Same here. I was looking forward to meeting you.   Sol:   [setting the bags on the floor]  So here are our business cards, hun and our questionnaires. We should sign them up. I did some. Here take these...   Aura:   *nodding*  You have a pen?   Sol:  There you go.   Aura:  Thanks.   Waitress:  Good morning. Would you like something?   Aura:  Black coffee please.   Sol:  Tea would do.   Virgo:  Coffee please. With milk.   Waitress:  Of course. Oh the room is ready. You may now go inside, ladies. [nodding at the stewards getting out of the room]   Virgo:   [entering the room]  Wow.   Aura:  Nice. Did we really need a table for 20, I wonder.   Solara:   [points at the mahogany interview set across the room]  How about there? Wouldn't that be bossy if we waited him behind the desk?  [mimics a stern gesture]  Please Neale, have a seat.   Aura:   *grins and drops her bag on the meeting table*  Alright.   Virgo:  Crystal water glasses?  *sits across Aura*    Sol:  Velvet seats?  *sits next to Aura*    Aura:   *takes a pen from the table and goes on signing the questionnaires*  Silver pens?   Virgo:   [chuckles] Sol, why don't you come over here and I sit next to Aura? I feel... uneasy here.   Aura:  Why?   Virgo:  You know... Neale will be sitting at the head of the table. Right next to you and I. It should be you two seated each side of Neale.   Sol:   *waves a swift gesture of dismissal*  Oh come on, sweetheart. Nonsense. You'll do just great over there.   Aura:   *flips and moves on to signing another questionnaire*  Definitely. Are you anxious?   Virgo:  Somewhat...  *takes the signed questionnaires and tidies them*    Aura:  Why? You're not alone and this is no trial, no test. It's going to be a friendly, cozy meeting with an old friend.   Virgo:  I know.. It's the anxiety of meeting  him  in person.   Sol:  Once you meet  him , you'll be surprised why you were nervous at first place. He's just a calm, sweet guy. Not some cocky celebrity at all.   Aura:  You said the TV schedule is not cancelled?  *passes another pile of questionnaires over at Virgo*    Sol:   [nods]   It was rescheduled for 8 am instead of 9 so that he can meet us.   Aura:  Neat.   Waitress:  Excuse me  [serves their orders] . Anything else I can get for you?   Sol:  That's all for now. Thank you.   Virgo:  What are we gonna talk about, by the by?   Sol:  I did a list of things we pulled together. The website, the questionnaires, brochures, the office under construction...   Aura:  That's a great idea, Sol. Still, I'm sure that we'll do just fine going with the flow of conversation.   Virgo:  Oh... here we go.   Sol:  Hm?   Virgo:  There's movement outside.    -They all turn their heads towards the entrance. A short, Asian lady enters the room first followed by a woman with long, auburn locks falling all the way down her waist-     Sol:   [getting up]  Young Hee!!  [she hugs the Asian lady tight and they start talking]    Zepur:  Hi ladies. I'm Zepur. The international contact of SpiritArt.  [hugs Virgo and Aura]    Young Hee:  I'm Young Hee  [smiling sincerely] , Neale's assistant.   Aura:   *replying with a smile as sincere*  Aura. Project Director of HT Ponderland.   Virgo:  Virgo. HT Ponderland News & Media Relations.    -Loads of hugs again as a tall guy with a Zeus-like outlook appears at the entrance-     Zepur:   [murmurs something at the guy before calling inside]  Alright ladies. Have a great meeting and I'll see you tonight.   Aura:  Thank you. Until then...   Neale:   [walking and talking silently as he steps in]  Hello ladies.   Aura:  Hi. I'm Aura.  *shakes hands*     -Shaking hands, smiling etc.-     Neale:   [heading towards the head of the table after talking briefly to Young Hee]  Shall we?   Young Hee:   [heads towards the door]  I'll be back in 10 minutes.    -She closes the door behind her as the quartet take their seats. The morning sun pours in from the open windows and a plane passing by momentarily casts a shadow in the room-

       Timeline:  Present     Sunday, May 30 16:26 Streets of Ponderland      Aura:   *waves at a taxi, realizes it is occupied, curses something under her breath while trying to cut the ringing Badinerie of her mobile off*  Yes?   Sol:  Where are you, hun?   Aura:  Trying to get to SpiritArt's office. Where are  you?    Sol:  Don't, love. They cancelled the meeting.   Aura:   *lowers her hand too late. A taxi comes to a halt before her. She taps the window and calls out*  Sorry! So sorry! My bad!  *taxi driver raises a polite middle finger at her before he guns away*  Now! Run that by me again?   Sol:   [sighs]  They cancelled the meeting because the event is split into two days so there is no need to discuss where we stand in this matter. Neale will be signing books on Tuesday and the conference will be held on Wednesday.   Aura:  Sol, the original plan was a table reserved for us next to Neale's while he signed his books after the conference and we distributed our brochures as we had one-on-one correspondence with those interested in Humanity's Team.  *takes a deep breath before she concludes*  Are you telling me that it is all RUINED?   Sol:  Right.. Ok, I'll be there in a minute... Listen, honey. We'll talk later tonight. My patient has arrived. Hopefully I won't set the hospital on fire. Breathing out flames here, you see.   Aura:  I hear you. Bye.  *hangs up*      Sunday, May 30 17:45 Streets of Ponderland      Aura:   *leans her forehead on the window and feels somewhat cradled by the movement of the double decker*  Yes?   SpiritArt's PR Mrs. Shrewd:  Ms. Mars?   Aura:  Right.   Mrs. Shrewd:  I have been trying to contact Solara but her mobile is unreachable.   Aura:  Possibly. She is seeing a patient Mrs.Shrewd.   Mrs. Shrewd:  On a Sunday?   Aura:  Correct. On a Sunday. As in on a Sunday you called us for an urgent meeting. What is it now?   Mrs. S:   [sighs]  I wanted to let you know that there is a change in Neale's schedule.   Aura:  This is change number bazillion and five, Mrs. Shrewd. Personally, I'm not interested in your cancellations, your rearrangements, your recancellations and readjusted rearrangements. Do you have something set to give me  at all ?   Mrs. S:  Well this change is about you and Solara's private meeting with Neale as representatives of HT Ponderland on Wednesday.   Aura:  There can be no alterations. It was scheduled via HT International.   Mrs. S:  Obviously, there is since Neale will be live on TV during the time you want to see him.   Aura:   *mentally counts to five*  Correction! It is not about  our  wanting to see him but rather  his  wanting to see  us . We let the International liaison know about it and they set us up between 9 and 10 am in the very morning!   Mrs. S:  Well.. obviously, he'll be talking to the cameras right then. We'll fix up another hour for you.   Aura:   *mentally counts from 5 to 10*  Mrs. S, I have a translation deadline for Wednesday. Solara has a presentation at University. We arranged our own schedules a week ago. I'm not living my life according to what fits your company!   Mrs. S:  I'll talk to Solara about it, then. Thank you for your time.   Aura:  If only  my time  was the slightest of your kind interest. Bye.  *mentally counts from 10 to...*      Monday, May 31 19:47 Cocoon      Aura:  I'm already fed up with this thing anyway, Sol. If they want to "possess" Neale entirely, that's fine by me. If they think they can come up with whatever they think needed to promote their event, that's fine also. But I am not going to keep running after them any longer like a puppy demanding attention.   Sol:  Tried to reach Neale via the number they gave me all day. No response! The hotel he'll be staying at give no answers, either.   Aura:  See? It is completely out of our hands. So time for us to sit back and relax. We did whatever we could do establish a contact. We did whatever we could do to let these people know that we want to help them with their event, to support them but it is obvious that they're trying to keep us out of it. As if we're some kind of... rivals?   Sol:  Rivals my...  [sighs]  Guess what Mrs. Shrewd said when I told her our concerns.   Aura:  I'm out of guesses.   Sol:  She said she'd be seeing Neale tonight and she'd let him know. Shit! Who the hell is  she ?   Aura:  That's what I'm saying! We are the ones who are representing whatever Neale is presenting to the world in this very country. Man, if there was someone who would be seeing him tonight, that should have been us!   Sol:  This is turning into an "our event, his show" crap!   Aura:  Exactly! So what I say is, we did our best. Time for us to sit back and relax. If they so want to be in charge, let them play by their egos happily ever after. I don't give a damn. If Neale ever asks where HT Ponderland is, let them come up with an answer for that. None of our business, any more! Now that we'll be having no opportunity to present HT during the conference, I'll just concentrate on abusing my free entrance and watching him speak, that's all.   Sol:  Yeah. Come what may! By the way Mrs. Shrewd told me you had an attitude towards her.   Aura:  I had and I have. So?    Sol:  So, I love you loads more!      Tuesday, June 1st 11:25 Home      Aura:   *takes a sip from her tea before she answers* ...No, dad. I have to run to get our brochures from the print. Heaven knows what good they will do to us, anyway but..   Dad:  Is that your phone ringing, beautiful?   Aura:   *runs to her Cocoon and picks up her mobile*  Yes, hun?   Sol:  Take a wild guess! Grab the nearest one.   Aura:  A change of schedule?   Sol:  Bingo! We're seeing him according to the plan. Tomorrow at 9 am. His suite.   Aura:  Tell me how long you think this will remain as it is.   Sol:  2 hours at most.   Aura:  Had Pollyanna for breakfast, dear?   Sol:  Wait... My mobile's ringing. Make that an hour and a half...  [hangs up]    Dad:  Does this tie go with this jacket, beautiful?  [pauses]  Is everything, alright?   Aura:   *nods dreamily*  Uh-huh... Huh? Oh yes all is right. It's just that we came across a polluted river through the journey.   Dad:  Eh? So?   Aura:  It stinks!   Dad:  Err...   Aura:  Nevermind! A private joke  *smiles* . Why don't you try the one with blue stripes?

        Timeline:  Present   Voila! I broke a new personal record!   I came across a someone (that someone you have been reading about for a while now) who seems to be the love of my life potentially.   I also realized that this time&nbsp;the aforementioned someone&nbsp;might really&nbsp;be my soulmate since there are too many karmic aspects that cannot be ignored between us (such as our lives up until now have had so many experiences in common -- his father faced bankruptcy, either, he had to quit Uni for making ends meet as well, he is supporting his family, too, he had a lonely adolescence either etc etc...&nbsp; or such as we have many a things in common --blue is also his favorite color, he loves to spend hours in front of Playstation like myself, he smokes and lives solely on cigarettes and coke sometimes, he has "shell mood" patterns exactly like me etc etc).   Moreover, when we touch, sparkles start flying around. When we kiss, the earth shuts itself down and when we embrace [censored].   The record is, we met, I found myself speedily falling for love (for the first time, too, mind you) and a shadow stepped forward to kick me in the butt and throw me over into an abyss so that I found myself speedily falling away from&nbsp;love again in less than two weeks.   After all how many women (who are about to fall in love) on this earth can react mature enough when the most delicious kiss she has been experiencing in her lifetime is cut in half thanks to the ex-grilfriend of the one who shares her kiss?   And how many women can smile and nod when&nbsp;her Kissmaster&nbsp;stands up and excuses himself to make a private phone call?   And how many women can continue being mature when the ex-girlfriend calls yet again just when she is in the arms of her lover clad in post-orgasmic emotional and physical waves?... and the lover&nbsp;murmurs an ashamed apology&nbsp;once more while slipping himself out of her arms to make another private phone call?   And how many women can tolerate a shadow upon realizing the shadow is not a shadow at all but is&nbsp;a&nbsp;form that is&nbsp;very present&nbsp;in her lover's life?   At least, we cannot hide anything from each other.... which leads to his telling me that he still feels responsible for her ex-girlfriend after sharing 3 years and getting so close to marriage with her.... that her family adores him even if their daughter and him are not an issue anymore... that he needs some time before&nbsp;another relationship...   ...and I understand. I know how it feels to be weary of emotions right after a burdensome love affair. Then again, I couldn't do this to myself...   Not again!  &nbsp;  I have seen so many right-off-a-relationship men in my life and watched them heal themselves&nbsp;and breathe again next to me. Ironically, none of these men ever chooses to stay with the one who helps them&nbsp;bandage their wounds. They either recover and go back to the girlfriend&nbsp;or&nbsp;sail forward into their own tomorrow refreshed and renewed.   The healer is always left alone!    So I set him free... to heal solo.... to cherish life and being single again, by himself... Moreover, it would have been too difficult for both of us. I&nbsp;couldn't expect him&nbsp;to&nbsp;tend his ex-girlfriend AND try to soothe his new girlfriend (-to-be)&nbsp;simultaneously in this weary state he is in. Sooner or later, it would&nbsp;exhaust him and draw him further away until he is no longer reachable. I couldn't expect myself to sit and wait in a corner, hoping that one day he should be free of his burden so that we could experience the&nbsp;beautiful relationship&nbsp;we deserved. It would&nbsp;emaciate me.    Thus,&nbsp;instead of a sanctuary we'd end up having a ruin for two!    I did what I had to do and took a step out of this&nbsp;budding relationship and the&nbsp;side of this man who could be the love of my life.   "I'm doing this for you" I said as tears welled up in my eyes (although I promised myself I wouldn't cry and put yet another emotional burden on his heart&nbsp;by letting him see me hurt).   "No." he answered as he pulled me in his arms "You're doing this for you"&nbsp;   [Painful pause]&nbsp;"Yes. I'm doing this for me" I muttered "And for us."   "You don't have to." he whispered in my hair "I already made my choice. I just need some time. She is alone and in need of a close friend, that's all.&nbsp;She and I&nbsp;are over for ever."   I swallowed hard to repress further tears&nbsp;flood down&nbsp;my cheeks. If only I could believe him. If only her name was still not&nbsp;the logo of his mobile. If only they still didn't&nbsp; fuck  occasionally... and if only a man and a woman could be "close friends" when all they shared for three years were always there to remember each time they got together.... and slept together! (You tell me!&nbsp;The  Gambit  memoryline&nbsp;says so much&nbsp;more than words can&nbsp;depict&nbsp;about this issue) Hence, "We'll see" was all I could say.   So he dropped me to the bus stop and planted a quick kiss on my lips before uttering a "See you".   "Yeah" I nodded and stepped into the bus...  ...it was&nbsp;not&nbsp;until his tall and&nbsp;broad figure waving at me disappeared in the distance, the tears started flowing freely all the way back home&nbsp;(hell with I-never-cry-in-public pride!) while accompanied by a tune&nbsp;that&nbsp;kept knocking my&nbsp;system out&nbsp;through my earphones:     "I want you to know one thing  You know how this is

       Timeline:  Present   It all began on Sunday evening when Angel and a group of her friends made it to my neighborhood and gave me a call. As one might remember (either because you adore me and don't mind using up your precious memory storage with unnecessary details about my neverending misperceptions or you are&nbsp;smart enough to say "Hey why would I ever wanna lol remember somethin' about ya lol when even what&nbsp;colors your lol mommy's underwear&nbsp;were are recorded lol online? lolololollmaoroflmao" for which I might get a wee bit touchy) I left you while having a "misled" Sun-day last time.&nbsp;Thus, when Angel and a group of her "buddies" invited me for a dinner, I jumped on the offer not knowing&nbsp;my landing would turn a little too rough.   The dinner was perfect and I enjoyed it immensely.... if you don't count the new-waitress-on-the-block constantly mixing orders... if you don't count my&nbsp;perpetual yearning for something cold to drink thanks to the aforementioned waitress' keep serving me capucino instead of one, very simple glass of coke... if you don't count my&nbsp;stubbornness leading to my&nbsp;casting hands on a glass of coke after an hour only to find out that it was Diet Pepsi... if you don't count my being made a pass at by a steroid-induced,&nbsp; {free inserting suitable adjective section for the reader}  guy who thought he was the center of the universe and was&nbsp;arrogantly dismayed when he eventually realized I was not interested the slightest in&nbsp;the abdominals he kept shoving in my face.   Like&nbsp;I said,&nbsp;the dinner was perfect. The twist, though, took place when something unexpected was triggered by someone I least expected. Before Abdominals decided to ignore me, he managed to throw a question my way which I couldn't catch on time&nbsp;to avoid its hitting&nbsp;the bulls eye --  "So you've got a boyfriend?"    I swallowed in slow motion and mumbled something like, "Yeah, I have someone special in my life" but the response was alien to my ears.   Did I have a boyfriend, really? .. or someone special in my life?&nbsp;Well there was this guy who was interested in me, alright... well this guy was magic when it came to horizontal matters, alright... well this guy was kind, serene, spiritual, smart, thoughtful, smart, spiritual, serene, kind, alright  {ie. writer's chronic adjective block continues} ... well this guy was hot, alright (6 feet of perfect swimmer's build and piercing hazel eyes surrounded by long lashes to name a few features)... well this guy "felt home", alright!   But was he my boyfriend?   It stroke me to realize that although we might have been very close to remembering us being "soulmates" (and I swear to God I wasn't going to bring this term up ever again but it just doesn't let go of me!), I did not know anything about the things going on inside his mind (although, as one might very well guess, I briefed him about my life story in less than an hour-- Honesty&nbsp;vs. dumb straightforwardness).   Not to mention during the last&nbsp;30 minutes&nbsp;of the dinner, I was theoratically off-line (I'm later told that I was sitting there with an imbecile, frozen smile on my face and Abdominals thinks I'm frigid).   But you see, I'm mature&nbsp;enough so as not to&nbsp;cause tantrums over matters like these.          [Abrupt silence filled with disbelief]    &nbsp;  So when he called me next night for the first time, I let the conversation swim&nbsp;in safe waters until my cunning, shrewd female mind caught the opportunity to go, "...uh-huh... I might have totally agreed if there was something between us. Speaking of which, is there something between us?"   There was!   "...oh that's wonderful... really... and what kind of something is that, I wonder. Do we have a relationship?"   We did (albeit not in the traditional sense)!    "Yes, yes&nbsp;of course... I like that sense, indeed..."      &nbsp;

       Timeline : Present  &nbsp;  The power of not knowing aims to strangle my delicate neck.. My fragile limbs clad in elegancy are on fire... My restless nights are filled with exclamation marks whose dots remain hovering in the void as their bodies fall and thrust in my flesh like Spears of Apocalypse...  &nbsp;  ...and I bleed my tears this time. Tears running out of my wounds since my blood let go of me eons ago.  &nbsp;  These days I may be silent but my reality is so filled with voices that I wish and long for my moonlit tranquility. Then again, even nocturne does not&nbsp;hold me no more. Once more, I stepped out of my Coccoon and into the stream of life only to be courted and chased after for my beauty and not my heart.  &nbsp;  I am "somebody's fair lady" who accompanies somebody smoking naked in the bed.  &nbsp;  I had had enough of passion and prayed for that special something that would become constantly&nbsp; more . I remember the pigeons cooing to each other in our balcony when I was a little spirit. How they lulled me to sleep.. how I rested in their voices safe and sound, musing away for hours on end... how innocent life and dreams were...  &nbsp;  ... The power of embrace is sealed with lust too soon ... how I tried to avoid it... finding myself blind excuses... yet I ended up in deaf, hollow, mutliple orgasms in vain...  &nbsp;  He has a "Sea"...&nbsp;a subplot of an ex-beloved&nbsp;staining my sparkling&nbsp;maybes with mud... how can I cope with a shadow?&nbsp;I detest the protagonist of&nbsp; urlLink Rebecca &nbsp;whom I gradually enflesh.  &nbsp;   Of peculiar Love, I am carefully avoided.     Ever since my Incubus departed me, I have remained unconscious on the shore... Awaiting a life kiss from an unidentified shadow... So that my fish's tail would give way to legs with which I could run free again... Just when I believed, I ended up sealed in&nbsp;a steel&nbsp;clasp... I ended up wanted... I ended up desired... I ended up praised... I ended up being&nbsp;idolized&nbsp;for&nbsp;a model's body...   &nbsp;

       Timeline:  Present    Friday 9th 2004 03:05 The Sofa    In your arms Being reflected in your eyes... An indiscribible script! How can I trace that never was afore? What is it that your embrace breathes? What do you "ain" that else I've met did not?   Why is it so elementary To be in your arms?   Is this Love? Lust? Is this Temptation  I labor on your crust?  The act of "fitting each other"... ...limbs fitting each other... ...thoughts fitting each other... ...scents fitting each other... Teach me if hearts fit each other as well!  "God! What is this?" It is: 45 minutes of continiousness upon 10 hours of ethereality Making  it  impossible for two to be what they used to be.  It is a clock that ticks stunnedaghastecstatic seconds Devoid of Mid-night. What will it read when we strike the inevitable moment? Dreammate? Causemate? Fleshmate? Mindmate? the once-in-a-lifetime Soulmate?  Never the less, (my favorite remark) the inquiry of the now goes: ,As Devil-spelled-backwards-Lived Slowly drifts away,  Why is it so secondary Not to be in your arms?

       Timeline:  Present  ~ It was high time I took up writing in a professional sense. I have just completed two articles for a soon to be published (next week to be precise) magazine named "New Age & Life" in Ponderland. One is about New Spirituality (which will be a regular column where I'll be talking about different topics related to NS) and the other is about Humanity's Team (which will also be a regular one. This month I co-wrote it with Solara).  ~ We launched our first Emotional Support Group on Saturday and I experienced my first  Facilitator hood. It was an astounding 2 hours which turned out to be extremely soul-salutary. Apart from the Saturday group, I will launch another Emotional Support Group next Tuesday which will be held in English for foreigners (currently made up of an American and a French).  ~  The Godfather  passed away. He has been a magnificent talent and actor who shall be missed. Then again, I believe he is already immortalized via his art. Until next time, Mr. Brando.  ~ The grandest news for me is my Zeus (see Physiognamical session of Phenomena on the left), the embodiment of my fantasies and the only male celebrity that I find physically alluring is coming to Ponderland for a photo shoot. For a day or two, I will be under the same sky with Marcus Schenkenberg! That would be the next best thing after being under the same sky with Christopher Reeve.  ~ On an even lighter note, I am in active foreplay with one of our members. A guy upon whose entrance the young ladies take some time to swoon. It was high time some smart, spiritual and good-looking Libra was drawn to my orbit since I have imprisoned myself in a monastery for almost two years. Two years of nun/non-life after 2 years of non-stop dating. It is not surprising that with the reality I create for myself regarding "grey", even my love life is either black or white. Anyway, it is not something serious, for certain. At least not yet. However, I certainly missed being the source of a man's keen interest.   I missed telling someone "Guess what happened today? The only hint you get is it is something I'm very excited about" and being readily responded with "You formed a study group for yourself" (he had been thrilled by my enthusiasm about these groups earlier)... or someone who cares about my whereabouts... or someone who makes plans for me... or someone who doesn't get bored listening to my neverending prattle about HT's projects... or som... you get the idea.   ~ Currently, I am in rapture since there is this young guy who just entered the office, wafting an extraordinarily fresh odor. He smells of a very light after shave uppertoned with the aroma of super clean clothes. Have I ever told you I am very keen on scents? My memory bank tends to categorize and save people, situations, memories according to their smells and whenever I come across something resembling that fragrance, I immediately recall that person, that day, that specific event. Not to mention I am also very sensitive towards any type of stench.  I am taking a deep breath and....

       Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1999)  Clad in enthusiasm Of casting anti-self spells everyday aside, Here I am, Longing for a morrow that will halt disguising itself As a  brand old day .  Look what I have mother - The stigma of a Phoenix, Rising herself from his ashes.  Look what I become grandmother - Your baby reincarnating, A legion of possibilities nestled in the barracks of her busom.  Look what I am father - So much more than I could ever be, Yet possessing none of which I used to hold.  A bundle of paradoxes shimmer as they rise in my east, While a candle of youth-old oxymorons sets in my flickering west.  Hence what I am to do but harbor myself in the Night?

       Timeline:  Present Perfect  "You have just ended a relationship" he said while his hand travelled down my spine and caressed the back of my waist "I don't want to confuse you."  I turned my head towards the red full moon reigning in the soft summer night we have been experiencing with a group of our HT family. The bar we were enjoying ourselves at was on the rooftop of a skyscraper overlooking the city and the lounge we were sitting felt as if we were right under the endless star-lit skies. "You don't confuse me." I muttered softly to Lynx while my crossed-legs leaned against his thigh "There is nothing I find confusing about exchanging Love's energy." I turned back towards him and met his eyes that were searching my features intently "If I could set someone free of me that means I also set myself free."  He tilted his head as his gaze shifted down to my lips, "You don't hurt?"  A half-smile appeared on the verges of my lips, "I do but that won't alter anything." Reaching forward, I rested my head on his shoulder and felt his arms closing around me in a tight embrace.  "All I want..." he murmured as one of his hands kept stroking my lower arm "...is to be somewhere with a better lighting so that I can see your eyes."  "There's so much time ahead." I replied, the expression on my face getting somewhat stoic.  He chuckled softly, "I have only weeks to go before I attend military service for at least 6 months, you know."  I raised and brushed a dark lock away from my shoulder while I faced him, "Indeed... doesn't  ahead  cover that period and beyond?" He remained silent, listening to me carefully as I went on, "Since there is no such thing like coincidence, I don't think all these people..." my hands opened to gesture at the members of HT we were surrounded by, "...come together to let go of each other."  He drew me close to his chest again and nodded. Before long, Deirdre (another family member of our HT) signalled for him and he raised an eyebrow with a wry smile on his face, "May I?"  I leaned back and smiled at him with a wave of my hand, "Enjoy". Thus, I nestled myself next to Solara while Deirdre and Lynx were soon in each other's arms. Solara chuckled and leaned closer to whisper to me while her boyfriend remained silent next to her, "That's so Deirdre, you know. Whenever we go out, she finds herself someone to snog."  I smiled at Solara's comment, "O' the unconditionality of Love!". Feeling quite delighted to see that everyone was getting along with each other perfectly, I drew my knees against my chest and leaned at Solara while BTV and Deirdre's cousin Sonja came along. "How long have you and your potential soulmate known each other for?" asked Sonja as she threw herself by my side on the sofa and BTV drew a chair across us.  Thus, we exchanged empathy and support (since we both were so in the same condition) while BTV kept listing why Kratos (the potential soulmate) was not "the one".  All-in-all it was a beautiful night followed by a yesterday night featuring Gambit.  Gambit, indeed.  He does have perfect timing to knock on my window and remind me of himself after months (years), does he not?! Gambit texted me out of the blue last night while I was crying by myself, listening to the CD Kratos burned for me via the CD/MP3 player Kratos had bought for me (!?). For some ironic reason, I never felt that the songs carried traces of a present but rather made me think of a Kratos on a winter night listening to these songs that hold memories for him and her ex-girlfriend! (hence the reason of my tears.. Jealousy? ... Knowing that it is not I who is the attributed protagonist of these songs?... Oh hell!)  Per usual, Gambit stepped in to make me smile just when I needed a smile!  Darn it! If there is a myriad of people out there who  cannot let go of their past , why shouldn't I let MY past give me a smile?    PS:   Darrell, you are an amazing friend and writer! If you please excuse me, I cannot help but direct the readers of Phantasmemoria towards  urlLink Shadows of the Heart  so that they can cherish your talent and read my lines-in-between that you so skillfully put together. DF loves you!
