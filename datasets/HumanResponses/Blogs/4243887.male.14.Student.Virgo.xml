      Yeah today wasn't as bad as yesterday... It wasn't raining so I got to go out and skate for a while. I'm really close to landing my 360 flip... I just need to work on the landing. I'm trying to find some good skatespots anywhere near here so I can make a sponsor tape.... Hopefully I can get sponsored by somone halfway decent (There is a local team called Sane that I wouldn't mind joining) anyway... maybe I can find a nice 9 stair to 360 flip over if I can get my landings good! ;) Talk to you kids lata!

      Yeah so I'm really bored right now so I decided to post again... Have you ever heard of the Pop Rocks and Coke rumor thing? Ya know, if you swallow pop rocks with Coke or any other soda, that it will make your stomach explode? Well, one of my friends was talking about it and I felt brave so I did it... I bought a pack of Pop Rocks (mmm... Strawberry) and a 1 litre of Dr. Pepper (Dr. Pepper is my form of crack.... Tasty, and legal) I put the whole pack in my mouth and took a big swig of the Dr. Pepper. The pop rocks popped all the way down my throat! It feels funny, but I'm not dead :) In all this I got 2 things.... A new favorite snack and 5 dollars! ;)

      Yeah so I decided to make one of these after seeing one of my friends' so yeah... Umm... I guess I should say some stuff about me. My name is Jason. I live in Iowa and I will be turning 15 on September 1st this year. I like to play many different sports like Baseball, Football, and I like to skateboard. Anyway...  Today kind sucked... I wanted to go out and skate but it was raining and I didn't want to get the griptape on my board messed up... :( So I just stayed up in my room and played my guitar and listened to music. Yeah my life sucks... Yeah I'm at the library right now because my internet is slow as fuck today (they've got DSL, I have dialup) and they have a half hour per turn thingy so I just got here and then this stupid fat bitch comes up and says, "Jean (the librarian), when can I use computer 4 (the computer I am at)?" and Jean is like, "He has about 15 minutes left" and I'm all like, "What the fuck?! I just got on bitch!" and she's like, "You've been on for 15 minutes... You need to share the computer!" And so I have to go soon because the dumb fat bitch wants to use this computer when there are 2 other computers that no one is using (She wants my computer because it has MSN messenger and AIM) It's not like anyone wants to talk to her anyway... I mean she's dumb and fat! Only dumb and fat people like other dumb and fat people! Well... I'm out!
