      Why i hate TimeLog... well, have you ever worked in a position that you are not trained for??? WELL if you have.. welcome to my club! i don't have to complain... i have learned a lot since i came, and i came because i wanted and it was one of the dreams of my life... so i'm not complaining... this is service... this is good... i'm not complaining...  not , ok? Well sinse i came i have done looots of things, some lots of fun some not that fun... i have worked in the gardens (the most beautiful ones) as a gardener (fun)i have driven trucks (fun) i have driven Vans everyday for 2 hours (fun & not that fun) i have cleaned bathrooms (!) i have cleaned breakrooms (?!?!) i have cleaned yards, tables, chairs, windows, offices... i have washed uniforms, boots, raingairs, more uniforms, clothes from extrangers (including underwear) cars, plants... i have deal with gardeners from all over the world (fun! sometimes) mainly arabs (not that fun) i have attend them, i have given them their uniforms, i have done their finance, i have deal with their money, i have pay them, i have took them to the hospital, to the restaurant to their homes, i have, cured them... etc... etc, etc, etc an a million of etc... But the thing that has presented the most big challenge and headaches is this  PROGRAM of hell!  called  TimeLog the friend manager  (friend manager for your grandma!!!) why?? you may ask... ok. let me explain...  Everything began, here in the Gardens of Bahji, in Akka Israel... i work here as an administrative assistant... well, i'm in charge of doing the account (ME THAT I CAN NOT FIND THE NUMBER 2 IN THE CALCULATOR) well i'm in charge of adding the time of hours they have worked per month (that begins every 26 and ends on the 25 of the next month... just to make it a bit more complicate) and after a long extrange and complicate process, were i have to check the 100 different contracts for each one of them, add the over time that is just added after 43 hours worked per week, but if they haven worked the 43 hours, but they have worked in a non working day it does'nt count, sometimes, but it does another times... i check their applications per vacations, and holydays, that considering that you have around 5 official religions in Israel each one takes different holydays so i have to check each one of theirs but some of the holydays are according to the lunar calendar, wich means that each year is in a different date, and some days they are allow to leave 2 ours before for some of the holydays, so you have to consider thouse 2 hours as overtime???  NO!! ...that and including, the pay sick and the accident sick, this month for example i had 1 gardener bitten by a snake and another one stunk by a bee, you think is easy???  NO!!  i have to fill 2 different forms in HEBROW!!!! do i read HEBROW!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! so i called the israely secretary that works in Haifa (very sweet lady but she's never there) or one of the local gardener to translate and help me... well have you ever read a form made by the goberment??... well can you imagine a gardener that doesn't speack english very well trying to translate one??? ... well... is worst than that... So considering all this facts... i proced with the accounting, at the beginning they had pounchig cards, so i had to collect them every 26th of each month and count hours in a looong complicate process... then sombody had the great idea of bringing TimeLOG "THE FRIENDLYYYY TIIIIIIME MAAANAGER""" it look nicer at least, each gardener has his own card now... they come punch.. leave punch... that's it! beautiful... for them, the program collects the hours and process them and every end of the month i am suppouse to get a exact calculation of the pay period for each one of them with each one of their extracomplicate contracts... and thinking that life is GREAT and i have my life solved i worked with Krisia and we created around 20 different work rules for them with different holyday calendars and overtimes calculations... my friend Krisia is extra-super intelligent ok! and she loved computers and programs... i don't know anything about them... i just know my Cad programs and i'm happy... well she had troubles creating this stuff... but we did it, and then she left, she went to Barbados and then Europe and then Spain... and i stayed... i was thinking everything was fine... but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! it wasn't fine... i correct the problems, i put all my very relax neurons into acction and try to figure it out how the hell you do this... and thank God they worked... i was happy about it, cause i taught i was not that computer smart... but the program started to work slow... slower... and s  l  o  w  eeee  rrr ... it didn't matter i fixed it for some months... YEEEEEEEEEEYY!!! life was beautiful... but... till i discovered that it was a mistake in the report... i was considering overtime two times... I create new work rules!! i put all my dear tired little neuronas into acction again... i knew the program this time i had trust in my self... and last month after weeks of hurd work and loots of coffee i kind of fixed for that month... but now i came to check the report again... and is not woorking!!!! is not, is not adding properly, last month i even called SEAGAL the company who create this program... and they didn't help, they said if i want something new i have to pay... well we are a not proffit organization that doesn't receive money from anybody except their members... some of them don't have much money to give... is not an obligation... SO WE ARE NOT PAYING!!!! we payed already... but now i have to fix this... and i have tried all the possible ways... all of them... and is not fixed... is my struggle now!! is my goal!!! i can do it!!! I CAN DO IT!!! oh God please help me, i need a couple of extraintelligent neurons now please...

      This is my first official blogy thingy...  I'm not so good at this writing stuff, specially in English, so i guess i will alternate between my dear espa√±ol and my so little English... you will notice what i mean with "so little" so if you are the kind that don't like misspells...Sorry but chau!!  Anyways... i guess i'll start with this thing...    Friends    I never been the popular kind... the kind that needs lots of people around to feel accepted or the kind that needs at least one to not feel alone...  I'm the kind of been by my own...  but i have changed since i came to the Baha'i World Centre, i have reconsider the fact of letting my self be hurt sometimes and accept that nobody is perfect... and discover wonderful worlds inside wonderful minds, so i think it was a good thinking... i've meet here incredible, talented, kind etc, etc, people... all of them! some of them have became part of me of my everyday thinking, i know now that i have to take care of them, like a precious thing, (my precious!!!...mine!!mine!!) like a shutting star that appears in the middle of the night in the most unexpected moment, and light every corner of your smile, and you know that you have to enjoy it, 'coz you don't know when another one will appear from nowhere... The same happens to me here... i'm leaving in 4 months, and who knows if i will ever see them again... all of them are from all over the world, spread like cardinal points... and i'm in "nowheretown"... a place that most of them didn't know that exist... most may have taught that i lived between Llamas and Incas, i explained to them... but to be honest i don't think they will ever consider to come to Arequipa in the Andes of Peru, at least not before they met me...  But i was saying that i have to take care of them, and i'm trying, i had friends before, but for some reason they hurt me in all the possible ways, considering that i'm a very sensitive person (i try very hard not to show it) i preferred to lose them than to try again... i remember that i spend years with out friends, not even one, anybody to talk with (except for my family, of course...), that will support me or care about what did i have to say or about my feelings, they were very lonely days...weeks...months, but i didn't want to try again i didn't want to be criticize again or ignored again or be harm or be used or misunderstood... so i didn't make any efforts to have friends around. i even forgot how to keep a conversation longer than "Hi! how are you? fine, thanks" that was funny sometimes, for i while i used to ask something and answer it my self before the person i was talking to... hehhee!! Sorry but it make me laugh... for me was funny, for them i was weir...  So when i came here i found so many people to talk with, to open my self with, to love... little by little i started to gain confidence again, in me, in the fact that i could be fun too, and people could like to be with me... and i thank God for this! i have met people from all over the world, from all kinf of backgrounds, with the most different tastes and senses of humor...  I have friends that like to eat till nothing else is left, friends that if they eat more than the diet says is unforgivable... Friends that hate chissy music and friends that can just ear chissy music (consider chissy to my standars of chissiness) and friends that listen the most extrange music... i have friends that heat coffe, and me (coffe lover) i have friends that find a mall the most fun exiting place and others that if they are left in one can become crazy... i have friends that love deep foreign movies and friends that fall asleep with them, friends that hate meat, friends that if they don't eat meat if like they haven't eaten at all... etc etc etc and i could cotinue forever...  But the important thing here is that they are my friends, and that i can say that they are  really my friends , and if i call them in the middle of the night they will come like a shutting star...

      I've being listening to Troba music... what is that??? you may ask, Is a particular kind of latino music, also known as music of protest(musica de protesta)... mainly against the military governments, this musicians were fed up of the abuse of the militaries, they were tired of the deaths, the kidnappings, and the people that were disappeared... I've been listening Sui Generis (Argentina) and Silvio Rodrigues (Cuba) and Victor Heredia, Mercedes Soza, Pablo Milanes and others...  Some of the lyrics are real strong and beautiful, and they have touch me till tears... one of them sang by Silvio and Victor Heredia says something like...  ""we are still singing...  we are still asking, still dreaming, still waiting...  besides the beats that affected our lives,  the hate's ingenuity, sending away,  to forget, our loving beings...  we are still singing...  we are still asking, still dreaming, still waiting...  That they tell us were they have hide  the flowers that perfumed the streets following their destinies...  where, where they have gone...  we are still singing...  we are still asking, still dreaming, still waiting...  not to lose the hope that knows that is still possible that the gardens get enlightened  with the laughs and the singing  of the ones we love so much""   Much more nicer in Spanish of course... and the translation is not accurate at all...   but is amazing just to know how many have died trying to defend their rights for justice, for a clean governments for peace and freedom, this singers are incredible, they will still singing this encouraging lyrics, arrasing people to fight for their rights, knowing that they could find the same destiny that found the ones they were singing for... i'm closer to the revolution in Argentina, because my parents lived there during that period, they weren't so involve in it, but everybody was involve somehow... my dad told me of a friend he had, his friend lived in the same building that he lived in, and one day when he came back from school his building was on fired, the militaries had put on fired his friend apartment and he never saw him again after that... he also told me how the students of Cordoba (city) stud up and fight, all together, it was so strong that they finally bit the military government and called again for democracy... still till today the mothers of the "plaza 2 de Mayo" ( 2nd of May square) in Buenos Aires, every Sunday they march in  circles with the pictures of their sons, daughters, husbands, that were disappeared during that time (1970's) they were famlilies brought down for selfish interests in power and money... i sometimes think about that, about how people can let that this happen, and is still going on in different ways in different places, and everybody is still to busy in their own things that doesn't do anything about it.  I live in Peru and when i finish my service in the Holy Land, i'll come back there... Peru is really a place were you can find the worst abuse in all its kinds... i know that i have to do something, i know i will, there is no way i can stay quiet, as a bah√°'√≠ i can do several things, in a pacific way with out hurting others, and that's what i'm going to do, i know that one of the deepest problems is the lost of spiritual education, a real and truly spiritual education, not an education based in dogmas and rituals, an education that explains the purpose of life, the nature of the spirit and the significance of religion... all the religions 'cause all of them come from one and the same source... i've been thinking in starting an "alternative school" in the Andes of Peru, it will teach political science, so the native people may know the kinds of governments are they been lead on, they may also know when they are being abuse, also the evolution of ideas, like science, and history and religion, how the world came in to be the world we are living in now... i will teach them their own religion, the world's religions and the evolution of them, also world issues and why of this decadence, so they may know why the world is so sick the reason of the sickness and the cure for its problems. But to do that i also have to teach basic education, teach how to read and write... (hmmm... ) there is a lot to be done... hope God will help me, hope this are not just words and they can come be truth some day... i don't have anything that i need for this now, but i'll work for it... who knows... i think is need it and i think that somebody has to start it, it doesn't matter if is me, i don't know much about it, but i have the idea and i can ask some people to help me... i think it can be possible...  Hope it can be! just to think that there is a place like that lost in the Highlands of Peru is exiting! i need people who speaks "quechua" (the local language) and also "aymara" there are some baha'is that can help me with this... i need to think more about this, maybe in the future i'll be writing about this... i don't know if i can have a blog for that long, is not something that is going to start in a month... i'll need time for this one! Who knows... why not?

      Estoy sentada junto a uno de los chicos con los que me podria llevar mejor en mi vida... el nacio el mismo dia que yo... 5 de Mayo... te dice eso algo??? sere tan egocentrica que solo me puedo llevar bien con alguien como yo??? Somos amigos y yo le tengo mucho cari√±o, pero no dejo que se vuelva intimo... porq?? porq me muero de miedo... y reconozco que es puro miedo. Te explico...  Yo estube con una chico antes de venir aqui... el fue la cosa mas extra√±a que me pudo haber pasado... lo que siento por el es un contraste de sentimientos tan extremos como de polo a polo... lo quiero pero al mismo tiempo me desagrada, admiro su ternura pero me asusta que sea un bruto, pienso en el todos los dias, pero no quiero volverlo a ver nunca mas... Estube con el por menos de 1 a√±o, el a√±o que aprendi mas de mi misma... el a√±o que me cambio la vida. Yo le di a el todo lo que tenia, y no tenia mucho, lo ayude en lo que pude, le di amor, le di comprension, le preste mi cama, le preste mi familia, le preste mi corazon... el tomo todo lo que pudo su sed era insasiable, me bebio toda hasta la ultima gota, me ahogo, me asficcio... y no me dejo ir...  El no tenia trabajo, no tenia esperanzas, no sabia nada... yo sentia que le pagaba para que veniera a verme... no le gustaba hacer nada de lo que a mi me gustaba, no le gustaban mis amigos ni mi familia ni mi religion, no queria luchar, no queria salir adelante... no tenia idea de nada... Pero porq aun esta ahi encajado entre mi corazon y mi garganta?... El me necesitaba... y el sentirse necesitada es un sentimiento muy peligroso, te confunde, no sabes si es amor o si es conveniencia, yo tambien lo necesitaba, necesitaba dar amor, cuidar de alguien, necesitaba a alguien que me acompa√±e, el estaba conmigo todo el tiempo, era facila hablar con el decir lo que pienso, no significa que el me entendiera, pero por lo menos ya no lo guardaba adentro, necesitaba cari√±o, ncesitaba abrazos, necesitaba besos... el me dio todos lo besos del mundo, tambien era tierno dentro de todo, el me abrazaba con el alma... Y el sabia que no hiba a poder ser, por eso no me dejaba ni un momento, el tenia la mejor sonrisa... el se reia de las cosas mas estupidas... le gustaban las telenovelas y le gustaba ir a la iglesia, el era pulcro, su cuarto siempre estaba ordenado y las hileras de sus zapatillas siempre estaban igualadas... yo le besaba el cuello y lo abrazaba... no dormia a su lado, no podia, el corazon me latia muy fuerte... Durante el tiempo que estuvimos nos vimos casi todos los dias, yo no tenia tiempo, y el tenia tiempo de sobra, no pude mas! trate de hablar con el de pedirle un espacio y no entendio, pero le habia prometido que nunca lo dejaria y le habia pedido que nunca me dejara... porq hice eso??? entonces el no me dejo, yo lo deje a el, viaje y me aleje para siempre, esa fue la unica forma que tube para dejarlo, el no me hiba a dejar nunca, no le convenia, yo le daba de todo, dinero, comida, tranquilidad, esperanza, le conseguia trabajos, le daba aliento... no me hiba a dejar... El no me entendia, no me apoyaba, no me daba aliento ni paz ni esperanza... yo me asuste, pense que tendria que mantenerlo por el resto de mi vida, me imagine viviendo con el, casada con el, me lo imagine educando a mis hijos, y no lo pude soportar... termine con el para siempre. Me fui, lo deje... me senti culpable, aun me siento culpable, pero quien hiba a cuidar de mi? quien me hiba ayudar con mis proyectos y mis sue√±os? yo con el no tenia nada... nada... no era justo. Me marco para siempre me dejo confundida, con el corazon destrozado, se aferro tan fuerte a el que cuando lo quise recuperar tuve que arrancarlo de entre sus manos, lo desgarro, lo dejo sangrando... aun sangra cada vez que vuelvo atras... Estoy tratando de olvidar, que fue mi culpa, que me equivoque, que nunca lo debi haber amado...  Ahora, despues de mas de un a√±o que todo acabo... he tratado de enamorarme nuevamente, pero no he podido, huyo de culquiera en el que vea una sombra de el... y todos tienen algo de el... Estoy sentada junto a un chico increible, pero es como el, no sabe que quiere de su vida... y me asusta, el es bueno y dulce y me hace reir, con el puedo hablar... es bello... pero no puedo, mi corazon no se ha recuperado del todo, mi corazon sigue adolorido...  No puedo...

      I think work is starting to affect me... I'm an Administrative Assistan... what does it mean? it means that i'm supoouse to help with the Administration... right? Ok! I work for in the office of Gardens... that means that there are around 40 gardeners and 2 mechanics, 1 courier, 1 coordinator, 1 operations manager... which means that just 3 of us work in the office... which bring us to the team of today...  I've been ask so many times in the past month if the only thing i do all day is just been sit behind the computer... We have a new gardener and is very particular... doesn't know how to be a nice person, is just... i don't have patience... anyways... i'm the administrative assistant right? thing that i didn't ask to be, i came to be a gardener too, and i liked it when i was working in the gardens, the think is that i know how to use the computer and do some stuff, so the coordinator asked me to do it, i say ok! manly 'coz my Dad didn't wanted me to come if i was just going to work in the gardens, you know i'm an architect... well not yet i still need to do my tesis and get my degree... anyways, for him it was a big deal to see me working as a gardener... he is not a bah√°'√≠ and he doesn't understand much about the spirit of service, I came here to serve, i didn't care how, i just wanted to be here.  I think i'm good at what i do... i don't know, maybe i'm not. there are days that there isn't much to do, and i confess that sometimes i've got distracted... but i've always done everything that i have to do, and i have done it fast, that's why i have time to spend... but i have realized that i've come here to serve to the best of my capacity and i'm trying, i don't go to MSM and i'm trying not to go to Web pages during working time... but i still do it sometimes, but when i do that i don't take lunch time and i work during that time...  The People i worked with, well the gardeners think i don't do anything... so i can't tell them anything because they think i'm not in a position to ask something... and that boders me a lot... even my coordinator comes to my office all the time trying to surprise me and see if i'm really working... If i'm not working like everybody thinks... how everything gets done, by magic??!? a magic elf comes and do everything at nights when everybody has left??? My day start in front of the computer, the first thing i do is check e-mails mines and the ones of the department, i check what is suppose to be done for the day, this is the time when i get distracted sometimes, because i start answering e-mails... but it doesn't take me that long anyways, i start at 6:30 in the mornings by 7:00 i have finish with e-mails not just mines, the office e-mails too, then i go to the Break room and i clean it, i change towel papers and tissue paper and soap and everything that is need to be replace and the break room is always dirty so i clean it and throw the garbige, they never do that... meanwhile i'm preparing my cup of coffee... i clean the counters and tables and wash disses etc, etc. then i grap my coffe and come back to the office, ones per week (sometimes i forget) i water the flowers... and clean the yard... then i come to the office... in the office depends which is the thing that is need to be done, lately has been the TimeLog and the Payroll, but before that i was doing the Oracle catalog and before that i was updating the files of the local staff and creating new files and make them look nice... there are also extra things to do, when my coordinator asks me to check something or to find something... i also have been taking pictures of the gardens for the web pag... also i was with the issue of the uniforms.. giving uniform to everybody and placing orders and doing the inventory... the temporary of rains is gone so i was putting away all the rain clothes and rubber boots, but everything was very dirty so i washed everything before putted away... that means wash like maybe 50 pairs of boots and raingears... then i wanted to be everything nice and clean so i was cleaning the storage room and i put each boot in a plastic bag so it will reamin clean till next rainy season... and a girl came and help me cleaning everything and she left it very nice... also i was doing the books inventory and it took me a while to update everything but is almost done... Also every morning i check invoices and aprove them and send them to be pay, a proces that can be a bit complicate to explain... But before they used to have lots of problems with vendors that complained becose nobody had payed them and they were waiting... but this last year everything was fine... i also have to revew the Ledger of each month and compare if everything was payed correctly... i also arrange volunteers days, it was a time that i didn't have free days... i was working from Sunday to Sunday... and Somedays from Sunday to Saturday... I also have to check that everything is fine with the gardeners, so i attend them with anything that they may need... and everyday there is something that they need... i also have designed some gardens and things and update some drawings... and i have revew another designs and give my comments about them... Right now i'm working with GIS, i kind of know it, but a friend is teaching me how to use it, but meanwhile i'm drawing all the gardens and creating the layers and all of that... and it takes time because the server is in another place and is very slow, and i have to revew another design and give my comments and also have to finish the catalog for the Oracle...  WELL that's most of the things i do dayly... Do you think i don't do anythig??? I wish they know and stop budering me!

      It's funny that this too words sound so similar... In Spanish they don't sound similar... so i will write this one in english... 'coz it sound better...  Sometimes i wish people could look through me and see my heart, then they will know that i don't have bad feelings for them (most of the time... with exceptions)I don't understand why is so easy for people to get mad with me... there are so many of them that don't even know me and they don't like me... why??? is it my face... do i look "unlikeble"?? do i look angry??? do i look unfriendly?? why?? i have spend time at the mirrow trying to figure it out... i don't look that mean... when i'm serious i look serious... is that bad?? do the people like me to be smiling like a clown all the time? i don't have clown spirit... there are times when i'm thinking and i'm serious... Why do i feel like of i need to explain it??? I've been dislike for so many people that doesn't know me... sometimes i care, sometimes i don't, sometimes it hurt me, sometimes i just let it go... The problem is that i can feel it, at times i could feel it like a physical pain... starts in my right hand and then goes to my stomach and finally gets stuck in my chest and heart... there had been times that i couldn't stay at some places because i just couldn't find anybody there that doesn't dislike me... That's sad. We should be like a fountain of love, giving unconditional love to everybody, i've tried, but it doesn't work, i know it has to be something with me, i'm not giving the right signals, i'm not showing them my love, i'm not letting them to see my heart... I wish they could just see it. OK! i've been hurt, and i have closed the heavy doors of my heart and is very difficult to open them again, but i'm trying why they can't do the same? and instead of take me as a stupid, just give me a chance... I think i just have to be more "macho" and show them that i don't have bad feelings for them, that i can be a good friend, and that they can trust in me... but i get lazy or scared or proud and i don't do it... also can hurt to much and i don't do it... Of course i'm not an angel that goes around with out a spot in her spirit, i have had bad feelings too, i have dislike people and given them the killing look... maybe i'm just getting back what i have given before...  Why am i thinking again about this??? 'coz i had felt the pain start in my right hand again, and i want to do something this time... i want to stop them! i want to show them that i'm not so easy to heat! ... Why should i do now??? i guess i'll have to go to the mirrow and practice my silly smile :)

      There is one guy in my life who has a clean record in my memory, he was always sweet, cordial, funny, interesting, he never did anything to make me feel bad in any way, he was honest, direct, he didn't lie to me, he didn't try to put a feet on me or try to probe he was more than me, he encourage me, he saw something in me that i've never seen before, he had faith in me... He didn't planed it, he wasn't trying to impress me, he was just like that, just being around him it helped me, it made me feel good... Because of him i took the courage to break up with my ex, a terrible and very heart tearing relationship, in which i was trapped, i understood that there were really nice guys like him and that they could be interest in me... i compared my selfwhen i was with him and when i was with my ex... and i was so different, with him i was happy, i could talk i was my self and i was better; with my ex, i was lost, i had no time for me i will turned to any side he will point, he needed to much and i didn't get anything from that... i loved, but i loved in a wrong way. I think God put him (my friend) on my way to learn more about me, to correct my self and to leave behind the things that weren't helping me to grow, to grow towards Him. My friend, the one i'm in love, or i wish to be in love with, left, he had things to do, to order, a family to take care of (his dad has being sick for a long time) and they needed him... we talked before he left and he opened him self with me... he said if the situation was different he will try something to be with me, and i said that life has thousand turns and we could met each other again if it had to happened... he left and i stay... i had news form him ones in a while, he had news of me sometimes... A week or two ago i talked about him with a friend that confess me that she thinks he is great, and i said that he really is... after almost a year not knowing much about him, and trying to forget and not to think, a year were i was with somebody else for a short period and discovering that he wasn't him, after cutting all kind of connection with him and erased him of my mind... he was still there in this magic spot of my heart, were everything is perfect, save, clean... and i talked about him and i told her that she should consider him and i loved him again... and i told her my story, with out trying to discourage her, just because i remember everything, after put him away... all came back, everything he did for me just because he was him... i told her he was amazing and they will be good together, and i dind't feel jealous or bad or sad... he never was mine, he is just the perfect guy held in my time, untouched. I wrote to him a week ago, she insist, she said _if he is still in your heart you should write... _ He will always be in my heart...  ... I said Hi! i was thinking of you...  he reply!  ... he said, i was thinking of you too... And now i want to show him everything, i want to bring him back, i want to hold him, hug him, kiss him, i want him to become part of my days... but it can't be, he is far... he has his life, he has his life... i miss him... I'm afraid he will do something and i will have to remove him from his place, i'm afraid he will always be so perfect for me and we will never be for each other... i'm afraid he won't find the angelic girl in me anymore... i'm afraid i'll know the truth, the one that says "everything it was just my imagination"

      Bueno aqui voy otra vez, despues de tiempito que no escribia nada... Que hay de nuevo??... Despues de 1 semana de vacaciones en la que dormi tarde, sali tarde y me reconecte a la TV... descubri que:  1. No me da miedo regresar a Peru, es mas me gusta la idea... 2. Que me gustaria estudiar algo de sociologia o algo relacionado con desarrollo rural, lo que me llevo a la idea de estudiar el curso de Educacion Rural (de postgrado) en Fundaec... lo que me da algo de esperanza, de verdad me gustaria trabajar por los pueblos indigenas... 3. Que me da igual si me quedo soltera o no 4. Que mi jefe se cree que yo he andado hablando mal de el a diestra y siniestra... que idiota! 5. Que no soy una "buena amiga"... porq me niego a bailar al ritmo de los humores de "las" y que me rodean, porq no pienso salir a entretener a nadie y porq aunq pareza que soy el √∫ltimo especimen en esta tierra... me gusta el tiempo que paso a solas. 6. Que es mejor quedarse callada y no hacer comentarios extra... 7. Que hay una constante lucha en mi interior entre mi autosuficiencia, mi seguridad y mi autoestima... que unque no pareza se puede tener una muy alta y las otra muy bajas de acuerdo al clima... al mismo tiempo me convierte en una persona segura de que es una boluda, pero que puede ser una boluda sin ayuda de nadie. 8. Que puedo ver programas de TV en idiomas que no entiendo y disfrutarlo 9. Que hay cosas que me importan mas en la vida que mi cabello, mi cutiz, mi peso, etc... y que eso es lo que me lleva a constantes encontronazos con mi realidad fisica, la cual no recibe la atencion que yo tomo por sentada esta recibiendo... y que la belleza no se adquiere por osmosis 10. Que se puede sentir verdadero amor en una noche y perderlo a la ma√±ana siguiente, pero que el recuerdo de esa noche te persigue para siempre.  Esas son las que puedo poner por escrito hay otras que simplemente senti y no encuentro manera de que mis palabras las puedan explicar...  Fue una buena semana...  me olvidaba... estube cuidando unos peces horribles... pero yo no sabia que los peces dormian y tambien que hacen caca por la panza... un proceso que puede ser de lo mas desconcertante...
