      Just read the 15 Minute Van Helsing on Livejournal.com. And I laughed until I coughed, and I coughed until I couldn't breathe.  Ah, lingering illness...

      Awesome. Buckbeak and Professor Lupin rule. Harry is growing up, and his world is growing dark. And that's the way it needs to be. The best of the three films, and a fine adaptation of my favorite book. *** out of ****

      Yes, still sick. But watched interesting programes on SCCTV (that's Seattle Community Colleges Television, for those of you with superior cable who skip past channels 14-30) and Discovery. Discovery's in-house programes on natural disasters are a combination of Access Hollywood and FOX cable news journalism; inflamatory and slightly hysterical.  I learned that ANY MINUTE NOW there's going to be a landslide on one of the Canary Islands that'll cause a MEGATSUNAMI, which in turn will wipe out the Eastern Seaboard. I'll take earthquakes on my coast anyday...

      Home, on my day off, sick. Headcold, cloudy, chance of a sinus infection with a few patches of serious congestion, looking to clear up in three to four days...Managed to go to the REI anniversary sale and spend money I don't have on a few things I kinda need (work shoes, thick socks, antibacterial hand goo) before I was overcome by fever and had to drive fast with the window down to cool off.  Used Barnes and Noble points and a gift certificate (courtesy the lovely Corinne) to purchse the complete Dead Can Dance on CD.  I think there's a theme here. Bonus moment: had lunch at World Wrapps, flirted ruthlessly with cashier, Weylin, who not only admired my Malificent button but used his powers to give me the mall employee discount on food. Yeah. Rock on.  Last night: Birthday party with family and friends, pizza, Sudafed, beer, and a damn fine margarita with a wee splash of cranberry juice.* Shocked by how many wonderful, interesting**, fun people I know and who seem to want to hang out with me. Maybe they were there for the beer.  I think not, however, for they came bearing gifts, and hugged me despite my sniffles. Enjoying the flowers from Katie, despite my lack of odor-sense at the moment. This evening: knitting on the couch, in bed by 8PM as work at 5:30AM tomorrow. Ick. However, IKEA beckons, its siren call luring LeaAnne, Jaiyh and me hither in the afternoon.   *Actually helped me cold out a twee.  **As Mom would say, "Anyone   interesting   there?" meaning sexually compelling and/or single, but I say interest lies in not boring one to tears. Besides, my success with "interesting" men involves me not blurting out stupid comments.

      Erin, So I don't get out of work before seven thirty a single night this week. Interested in drinks anyway? How about breakfast/lunch on Saturday? Let me know.  All is well here, except I'm still obsessed with Harry Potter--the soundtrack, the movie, the books....Argh! Also, just to let you know, harrypotter.com has a store section with all kinds of stuffed animals, including Hagrid, the Basilisk, and Fluffy. Yeah. Resisting the impulse to order, but the Force (of shopping) runs strong in my family...Oh, also obsessed with LOTR again, as I just re-watched (for the 6th time) ROTK. Yeah. Now I want to re-read ALL of the books. Dammit! When will something else spark my imagination so I can move on?!?!?!?!? moi  The drinks invite goes out to all, by the way. Although Erin is, natch, my first priority. Keeping fingers crossed: applied for the POS job at work. What this means: 40 hours a week, set schedule, working on a computer and with people, basically all the best things in jobworking life. Oh, and NO FUCKING CUSTOMERS. Yay!!!  Saw Mike's plays this weekend. He acted in 2 and the one he wrote was produced independently of his input. The first one he acted in was great. Sharp comedy. He played an anal-retentive writer. I think he stole a lot from his detail-oriented big sister...The second was a pseudo Vietnam thing. Not so good. Too, too DRAMATIC! He was fabu though, rather high energy. He had an inkling of gravitas, which bodes well for his future. The one he wrote: WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU YEMEN. Hilarious. V.v. well written. Yay Mike the writer!!!  Meggie and I had a fabu day today. We shopped. Petsmart for a new extendable/retractable leash + cookie (for her), sporting goods store for new Nalgenes (yes, 2 more), Jiffy Lube* for an oil change + cookie, and Eddie Bauer Outlet. Then we hit the beach at super low tide, where she chased sticks, birds, and waves, drank Sound water, got completely sandy and wet, and generally frolicked. Then home, where we snuggled and watched  Return of the King  and the second half of  Sexy Beast  on IFC** (brilliant movie if you haven't seen it). Now it's all about checking ferry times and hitting the hay. And maybe watching Star Trek 6 (the one with Kim Catrall and Christopher Plummer) on DVD. Life is good!!! Dance! Everybody Dance!!!  *One of the cutie (very young) boys at Jiffy Lube knew all the Teen Girl Squad names! He even did the voice to introduce them!  **IFC showed  The Limey  last night. Also bloody brilliant independent pulp noir. In fact, I'd recommend doing those two as a double feature night...So many ideas, so little time.

      My whirligigs, which I so lovingly put up a few weeks ago above my deck, are driving me insane. Insane in the membrane! INSANE IN THE BRAIN! Stupid wind. Snapped my big rainbow twirler off its axis, tossed 2 of my plastic twirlers onto the roof, and had been slamming my windchimes around SINCE 4 AM. Not nice, tinkle tinkle kind of noise produced, but rather the bells of freakin' Notre Dame.  That said, I'll take anything to get the Crash Bandicoot music out of my head. Thank you, Nivia, for turning me into a video game addict. I've been playing 3-4 hours a day. Not healthy.  Had breakfast with Marla yesterday. Yes, Marla "You are the ringleader of a group at work trying to get me fired" Hanify, stubborn born again. She took me out for my birthday, saying she was sorry she'd missed my party as she would have liked to have come. Yeah. She said it like I'd invited her, but not soon enough to get the time off of work, when in fact I never invited her at all. Breakfast was fine--The Library Cafe on 85th and 9th is quite spiffy.  Applied for the POS position at work. Computer detail-oriented job thingy, with guaranteed 40 hours and a set work schedule. Really though: anything to stop checking. Last night I sold alcohol to a man who reeked of cheap booze and was actually too drunk to speak. He kept mumbling what sounded like could once have been words until his inebriated tongue mangled all life out of them. I couldn't be bothered NOT to sell him his 18 pack of Rainier, though; it's his liver, right?  Quiz question #1 Jen has several dozen eggs which need to be made into: a) Pasta b) Bread Pudding c) Creme Brulee d) All Of The Above  Quiz question #2 Jen needs to make granola. a) True b) False c) It's just a lie propagated by the Bush administration against the American people. d) There are enough Cheerios in her cupboard to last until next week.  Quiz question #3 Is Jen going to actually do anything in the kitchen today? a) Yes! She is filled with ambition for the culinary arts. b) Yes, she will do her civic duty and make food. c) No. No, no, no, no, no. And no.  Things to do. Do I care? Not when Crash is waiting for me! He may just be my ain true love...

       It is 1:09 AM. I have been awake until 4-something-AM every day since...Sunday? Yes. So this is day (fingers...) five of no sleep before 4. I have written e-mails. I have finished 2 books. I have played a lot of Crash Bandicoot and Civilization III. I have watched enough television for the next six months. I have called people. I have peed. I have taken my vitamins. I have been drinking lots of water. I cannot fall asleep. I want to sleep. I don't get out of bed before noon, and if I do I am more tired, but not enough to sleep. I have a lot of lettuce growing on my deck. I am writing this. I should be writing fiction. I have to work from now until next Friday. Eight days in a row. Eight. At work. Tired. Bored. Broke. Writing. Tired. Not exercising enough. Don't care. It's too hot to do much aside from sip lemonade on the deck and read e-mail. And not sleep. Of course, too hot for sleep. It's too light for sleep. Too tired for sleep. I forgot to pick up my prescription today. I will do it tomorrow. In the morning. Maybe. Afternoon, most likely. I have a coupon for free nachos at Taco Del Mar. Nachos would be good right now. TDM is closed. So is Taco Bell. Shit, now I'm hungry. Hungry. There's food in the fridge but it requires cooking. Napa cabbage at 1:23AM, stir-fried with sriracha sauce. Just thinking about it gives me heartburn. Actual heartburn. I wish I could get my wireless internet to work. Then I could sit outside. With blog. Blogging for sleep. Mosquitoes, though. Fuckers would eat me alive. Can't sleep. Clowns will eat me. My orchid is about to bloom. Need to water and fertilize them all. Tomorrow. Not at night--that's bad for orchids. I could shower. Shower. That'd be nice. But my skin is so dry. Itchy and dry. No shower. No orchid watering. No food. Couldn't beat two levels of Crash without dying tonight, though I tried. Several dozen times.   Soy un perdedor  . I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? Great. Now I have Beck stuck in my head. My tired head. Better than my other earworm of late. "Take Me Out," by Franz Ferdinand. It's a great song. But not at 2:48AM when your bed is too hot. LOTR score has been stuck in me brain too. Jerry Goldsmith died yesterday. Cancer. He was awesome. And now he'll never score one of my movies. Fuck. Time to have a retrospective of his work. Maybe tomorrow. No earworms tonight. I think I should brush my teeth and take out me contacts. Dry eyes. Sticky lenses. Melatonin. Amoxicillan. Bed.

       So I went to the  Lord Of The Rings  Symphony at Benaroya Hall on both Friday and Saturday nights. Friday with a fever, with Mom and Art in one of the Founder's Boxes, Saturday  sans  fever, with Justin in THE VERY FRONT ROW. I could reach out and touch the violin soloist, and if I stretched I could brush Howard Shore's trousers. Fabulous both nights. Impeccable, stirring, beautiful music. Loved the whole experience! And I looked as hot as my fever implied...   Worked a full eight hours today. V.v. tired now, but too hot to think about getting into bed. Watered all of me wee plants for the first time in a few days and they were grateful for the attention. Couldn't deadhead as mosquitoes were on the prowl. My lettuce is looking good!    I, Robot  beat out  Spidey  for box office mojo this weekend.  Super suckage.  Think I'll have to catch a bargain matinee of that one.  Or not...  Check out Homestarrunner.com for a They Might Be Giants video!!!  I'm hooked on the song and want to make an experimental film of me own.

       7:15.  Wake up.  Blow nose.  Toss, turn, and generally flail in sheets.  Go back to sleep.   10:11.  Alarm goes off.  Wake up from dream about overdue  high school paper.  Blow nose.  Hit snooze button.   Realize that yes, you still have strep throat and no, you don't have to  go to work today (courtesy good friend Dr. Mary Saint-Clair).     10:20-11:45.  Repeat 10:11 every nine minutes (corresponding to snooze time).   11:50.  Phone rings.  Ignore.     12:15.  Check voice mail.  It was Sheryl, calling with  lamentations for your ailment.  Call Sheryl back, gossip for ten  minutes, plan outing to Fremont Sunday Market and Thai food for another  weekend.  Call Mom.  Get Mommed, ejoying every minute of it,  you big sickie.   12:50.  After much lazing about, get up and have breakfast.   Take vitamins, Amoxicillan, Zoloft, Tylenol, and Sudafed.  Sit at  the lable and read  LOTR .     2:15.  Straighten up apartment.     2:18.  Crawl back into bed, taking laptop with you.  E-email,  winks, and balance checkbook.     2:30.  Call Steph. Realize that someone has a worse life than you, and be grateful for  Steph's friendship and ability to make you laugh. More e-mail and light  surfing.   3:20.  Get back out of bed for lunch.  PB&amp;J on flax bread  with Cricket Cola and vanilla soygurt.  Realize that you eat like  the dirty hippie you smell like.  Think about showering.   3:27.  Read  LOTR  at kitchen table.  Think about showering.  Paint fingernails.   4:10.  Finish  The Two Towers .  Think about showering.  Decide to blog instead.    4:37.  Finish blog and get mad at Netscape for acting like a whiny  crack baby.  Listen to Franz Ferdinand's single, "Take Me  Out."  Shower!

      12:07 AM. Movie in U-dist gets out ( Fahrenheit 9/11 , amazing film, very VERY emotionally/intellectually provocative), Jen says goodbye to her friend, gets in car.  Realizes the reason she's felt "off" the last few days: Yeast infection.  To Ballard, where the 24 hour Walgreen's awaits.  Monistat to counter.  Rather attractive young man, ONLY clerk in the store, behind counter.  No flirting.  At all.  On to Ballard Market for Acidophilus, but no, they don't actually carry Acidophilus.  Fuck.  Get soygurt instead, realize trip to Central Market in near future.  Driving home, she witnesses a hooker get out of a john's car, adjusting skirt, into mini mart.  Now Jen is depressed and has a yeast infection.  Because what's summer without at least one yeast infection? By the by, skip King Arthur.  Sucks.  So fucking much.  Don't even get to see: 1) The leads naked, 2) Scenic castles, or 3) a beheading.  Not a single beheading!!! Actually, today was a good day.  I napped.  I e-mailed.  I made a fruit smoothie.  I saw 2 movies and am seeing Spidey with Scott in about...ten hours.  Must get some zzzz.......

      E-Bay is  e -vil.  Too much good stuff, not enough free cash.  That said, I have gotten some good deals on CDs lately...No go on my Buy.com points thingy.  They still haven't sent my the right # to link points to my account.  Bastards.  I want my ipod!!! Match.com rocks.  Apparently I am: 1) Dead sexy, 2) New, so I come up in all searches, or 3)  Le menu du jour .  At any rate, I have 5 e-mails to respond to and 6 winks, and none of the guys comes across as losers.  Why oh why didn't I do e-dating before?!?!?!? Anyway, in other update news: New laptop.  Shiny, pretty, nicknamed Legolas.  I looooove it soooooo much.  No crashing, 80 GB hard drive, phatty cool processor, DVD burner, wireless internet.  Also new laptop bag, wireless mouse, and a mini USB drive (128MB).  I haven't wanted to be on the computer this much in years!!!  And I actually want to take it places so I can write.  I think it's worth the $$$ just for that.  BestBuy has 18 months same as cash financing...Yay for good credit. Work sucks and there has been a lot of it lately.  Boo!   The Day After Tomorrow  was bad, but in a good way; very enjoyable disaster pic.   ADORED   Spider-Man 2 .  Today I'm seeing  King Arthur  (It is going to sucketh. Yay!), tomorrow Spidey again, Friday Spidey again (that'll push me up to 3 times), and  Fahrenheit 9/11  possibly later this evening...Hey, I fell behind!  And now for something completely different: Jen is going to go eat brunch.
