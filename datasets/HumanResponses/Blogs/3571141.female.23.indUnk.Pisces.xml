       urlLink    Starlight&nbsp; urlLink    Everyone's heard of Starlight and now you finally get to see a picture of her.  I will admit that she was prettier in her younger, thinner days, but then again, who wasn't?  She's still pretty darn cute.

       urlLink    Tundra&nbsp; urlLink    For those of you who have never seen her, this is the infamous Tundra.  Even if you have seen her, I'm sure you've never seen her as sweet as this.  Isn't she a doll?!

      Okay guys... this is starting to get pathetic.  I NEED A JOB!  I have absolutely nothing to do during the day (after I scour the newspaper and internet for job opportunities, of course).  I have an interview tomorrow morning at the Little Red Schoolhouse, but do I really want to be around 95-120 screaming kids everyday?  Also, could you    really    see me as a pre-school teacher?  Probably not.  I don't really think I have the patience for it.  So why would I apply there?  Good question... I think I was desperate.  But I guess they will tell me some more about this position tomorrow.  I'll keep you posted.

      Okay guys, I guess I'm kind of a ditz... I didn't realize that I had my blog set to where only registered users could comment.  My bad.  I have fixed that... now everyone can comment, so stop the nasty emails!

      When  urlLink 80's  attire became popular again for the spring trend, did you all think "WHY WOULD YOU BRING THIS BACK?!"  Well, I did.  However, today I searched hi and low to find some  urlLink 80's  wear for an  urlLink 80's  theme party that I am going to on Thursday.  I get that it was a spring trend, but you would think that there would be some places that still had some of the left over gear.  I had the hardest time finding anything.  We went everywhere from thrift stores like  urlLink Value Village  and Bishop's Attic to specialty stores like  urlLink Hot Topic , Pac Sun, and Zumie's to department stores like  urlLink Gottschalks  and  urlLink Nordstrom .  We didn't find much.  RJ found some hideous polo shirt at  urlLink Value Village  and we saw some of those slip on  urlLink van's  with the checks on them, but didn't think it would be worth spending money on something that he'd only wear to the party.  Luckily we found some  urlLink chuck taylor's  (Converse All-Stars) that will work -- of course they are the hi-top kind.  Too bad for me... I didn't find anything suitable.  Of course that is more than likely due to the fact that I am extremely picky... plus, the  urlLink 80's  truly were hideous.  I'm sure I'll find something.  If all else fails I will show up in a spandex workout outfit with those huge plastic hoop earrings.  Okay, that was a big fat joke.  Spandex?!  Yeah right!

      As my stupid title states, this is my first attempt at blogging.  When I say that, I don't mean this actual posting, I mean today.  Why am I saying this?  Well, that would be b/c I had just written the most wonderfully spectacular blog that a person could write and BAM! it's gone just like that.  With my luck, that won't be the last time, either.  Anyway, I'm starting a blog for 3 reasons... 1. I just moved back to Alaska and don't know many people so I get bored.  2. I don't have a job, so there is a lot of down time.  And 3. I am being bombarded by emails and phone calls asking what's going on with me.  So, rather than telling the same things to different people, I thought I would attempt to become one of those crazy bloggers...  Plus, surely I have some quirky stories to tell.  If not, I could always make them up, right?  I'm sure some of you are also kind of bewildered about the name of the blog " urlLink fake plastic trees ."  Well, if you are familiar with Radiohead, you know they were my inspiration.  Hey, it could have been worse.  Someone actually suggested "Reblogga."  Hmmm, probably not.  I'm hoping that  urlLink Thom Yorke  will stumble across this page and make me his favorite groupie.

       urlLink    I have a job!&nbsp; urlLink     Well, I obviously haven't written in a while and that's for two reasons... 1. I am lazy and don't really care to get on the computer much anymore and 2. I HAVE A JOB!  You guys are all probably thinking, "Holy cow - Bec has a job..." but it's true.  I am the  urlLink Clinique  counter manager at  urlLink Elmendorf AFB .  It's an alright job, but I have tons of paperwork to do... ARGH!  I truly hate paperwork.  Oh well, it's a job.  My next goal in life is to be a bar wench at  urlLink 'koots .  Okay, I'm lying about that.  But I'll probably start cocktailing or waiting tables somewhere soon.  I am bored with working only days.  I have nothing to fill my evenings with except the  urlLink Soprano's .  I don't think that's good enough anymore...
