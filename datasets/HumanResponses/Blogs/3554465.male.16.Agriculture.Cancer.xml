      Yeh I cant wait to be gone. Tommorow mornin early i leave for State 4h Conference yeh its gonna kick ass as usual. I will miss a few of my friends, but then again i will be making so many more friendships because thats what goin there is all about. and its not really even about 4h its just a college experience and its a lot of fun but anyways. Today was an easy day.  My dad gave a pig to the school for the auction and i took it to minden to be killed today and i just took the tractor and the hog cart because its so much easier that way and then the guy there goes "We dont accept hogs that come on a tractor," then he said "That fuckin sucks you'll have to bring it in on something else" then i said "that fuckin retarded you've got to be shittin me" and got the hog off and brought it down anyways. then he said he was just messin and i was still pist off at him because it really wasnt that funny. but he thought it was for some unknown reason.  Anywho, Ill be gone havin fun.  Oh, yeah ill miss megan and amanda because they are cool people and i think they are the only 2 that actually read this.

      So i get up aroun 5 this mornin to go sell hogs and then well i had to basically load them sonofabitches by myself because i had no help from my bro or dad, and this one time they got turned around and i had my sorting board and i got just ran over by these beasts. but we got them loaded then dad ended up buyin about 221 lil feeder pigs so i spent all day cleanin sheds and unloadin pigs and finally ate about 2 hours ago so it was a long but eventful day  *********2 MORE DAYS TILL STATE CONFERENCE*********  and im out like a flambouyant homosexual

      So, I woke up around about 7:30, which means i got to sleep in for once haha. And i start to chores but i wasnt home yesterday and my dad didnt get corn for this morning so i had to go over to my granpas house this morning. Then my dad came over and made me help him load up the sprayer, then burn the boxes, then my grandma needed help and to make a long story short i didnt get back home until 11:00 and i still hadnt got a chance to feed all the cattle. Thats so freakin frustrating. Then about 12:00 my dad has me run all over neola gettin him shit for the tractor. and then i finally get in around 2:00 and i jsut fell over asleep until 4 then did afternoon chores and almost hit this damn dog because it wouldnt stop runnin in front of the tractor, Then i walked my pigs because they are gettin so damn fat, or big i should say.

      Okay so i was at a family get togethere because my cousin Brian final became Eagle scout or something, and i realized how really fucked up my cousins were. So my one cousin is and unwed mother which doesnt exactly sit well with grandma but then her brother, one of my other cousins, is gay and he has gotten really sick and lost a lot of weight so maybe he has aids or something, but thats just one part. The other part is my cousins Nick and Megan. Nick, isnt going to college because he thinks that his job at the pizza place is going well. He's a real money maker i tell ya what, he was braggin about how he makes $6.75 now, Holy Shit better watch out for this billionaire and then Meghan was buying a shitload of beer right in front of my mom for my younger cousin nick, its like WTF you dumass.  But enough about my weird  ass family. The party for brian was pretty fun because Krista, Nicole, Aaron, Kristin, and Gable were there. Krista was a lil overprotective of her volleyball but then i hit it into the pool so she flipped out kinda. But me and Nicole had no trouble with the ball by ourselves.  Thats my boring story from today.  *If you cant feed it, Dont breed it*

      Okay so I was really getting frustrated and kind of scared about the WLC trip and I have to raise all this money. To date I have raised $470 which is pretty good, so i call and talk to Mr. Osborne and he says not to worry about the rest of it because he will find people to pay for the rest, which is a huge weight off my shoulders for the moment at least. That was pretty much my whole day trying to get money, getting shut down at times but i just had to keep on goin.  *You miss 100% of the shots you dont take*--Wayne Gretzky

      Girls  Something I will never understand is women. I mean seriously think about it, they can be all happy to talk to you one minute and then the next its just like they dont give a shit. O well. and it really sux when you really like someone and have to sit back and be the friend and listen to them talk about how much they like this guy. I dunno its just annoying and you dont want to say something and risk that friendship, but at the same time you dont want to stand back and just have to hear about the guy that they are likin these days. Its not like i have the best chance with this girl but, i still dont want to just sit back, but if i move forward i may or may not risk that friendship. Confusing, yes i know, but welcome to my life where confusing is the norm.

      Today was a pretty good day for me and all. It sucked that i did every single chore today by myself because my dad was lazy and my bro had baseball but its all good in the Neola hood i guess. I worked with my calves. That was allright considering mine are all tame. but my bro has a pyscho sonofabitch for a calve. Damn that thing rammed me into the gate. i just laughed at him and go "At least im not gonna be on someones plate in 2 months" haha dumb basterd.  So now, im talkin to amanda, shes pretty cool (at times) lol jk shes real nice and everything but shes talkin on the phone and kind of ingnoring me and its not a big deal because its not the first time it has happened.  I had to talk to the SW Iowa Leadership Acadamey today that went real well. I talked to them about my HOBY experience. I was only supposed to go about 10 minutes but i went about 40 but it was allright because all they were gonna do was do little cheers if i didnt take that long.  *If you dont stand for something, You'll fall for anything*

      Well, I have about the toughest decision to make and it really sucks but first of all Amanda is mad at me and i really have no clue why. So i have been gone for 5 days. I went to HOBY, the most amazing experience of my life and i have been changed forever. My group was awesome and for everyone who goes to SA, John Stinn was in my group remember he used to go to our school until like 2nd grade. Well the whole 3 days there was awesome and there is too much to explain, but i was picked as the male rep from Iowa to go to WLC which is like World HOBY. so its great but its the same week as WESTFAIR.  Amanda, im sorry if I made you mad. But i just want to say thank you for everything, it just was so amazing when you cried when i got that and i know none of any of my other friends really would have given a shit but you cried and you are amazing and i just want to say how much i appreciate you and you are just so great to be around.

      Well, Calgary lost but not for a valaint effort in the 3rd period at least. So now im just sittin here commenting on Hannahs journals. or should i say my half journal since she used what i said in half of it. Ashely started to talk to me but i completely ignored her it was soo funny, for me at least. I mean she just kept on talkin and i just sat there not saying a word. Its mean i know. Now me and hannah are having essentially a comment war which brings me back to a time when a closet homosexual threatened me. See, it was another great day of school, 08 of course, and i was talkin to andy from across the room. we were jabbin and then i go come over here andy i will protect you. Now i meant protect him from cory because cory was hittin him. but someone who i will not name to save their identity. flipped out. He went outside and started saying things to andy about me. "OMG i hate tj. i bet i could kick his ass anyday hes such a fuckin deush. i bet he goes home and rapes his cows like all farmers do." Yeh (Unkown person to ya'll) all farmers rape their cows its just the thing to do. speaking of raping i know ill never ever drop the soap around you it would not be in my best intersts.

          I'm sittin here talkin to meghan, and well it makes me think of the good ol days. The time i won at muttin bustin in a rodeo, and then all the good times at Westfair. It makes me realize how lucky i was and how good it really is to be me, at times of course.      It's weird tho, how i want to get off to college so fast but i still have 2 years and i cant wait to leave, but i know i will always live in iowa because thats where i belong. and to meghan my kid will kick your kids ass anyday in a tractor because lets face the facts he is the son of me and i have competed in the state fair peddle pull and you know its just in the genes of my kid to kick your kids ass in anything agricultural.      Well i sold sows today that was really fun.  loadin up those 600 lb well bitches they were mean and all having to do it by myself was so fun but its all good in the neola hood i guess.

      I just spent about 5 hours watchin a hockey game, then the fact that the team i wanted to win lost is a real bitch. O well it was an exciting one it went into double overtime then some deuche hit the puck in for Tampa Bay. I guess its allright but game 7 will be freakin awesome. There is just somethin about hockey that well is rather awesome. I cant explain it. All the checking and the furies are awesome. But now i am just waitin for meghan because she told me to be there when she got back on.  Meghan is a cool person. I do happen to feel sorry for her at a lot of times because well she hasnt had good luck as of late. many injuries but shell get through like a champ because shes tough.  Well im gonna go play solitaire and listen to some Kenny Chesney. well because i am a hick or so i have been told just because i listen to Country music. I know a lot of ppl who listen to rap so does that make them gangsters o well.

      It has been such a long day. I woke up and had to go to Stuart for the Area Council Car Wash. Great day for it, because it rained all day. So, therefore no one wanted their car washed, and the fact that only 1/5 the area council members showed up. We had so much fun tho, between me triend to figure out the McDonalds hose and all the girls whoring themselves on the corner tryin to get people to come to the carwash. Then these fuckin deuchebags showed up and said wash our car for a $1. So I, bein the smartass that I am told them they could get a little spray and maybe a lil soap so they flipped out and it was rather funny actually. But this dude was wearing a cowboy hat, long ass shorts, a michael jordan jersey and tennis shoes. He was definitely a scurve. but it was really good to see some of my good friends on Area Council. especially Molly, Cindy, Sarah, and Jennifer. Then i came home. Some girl called my house asking for me but of course my mom didnt ask who they were or what they wanted. After that i did chores. then watched the Belmont Stakes to see if Smarty Jones could win the Triple Crown. He didnt he lost to Birdstone. So then i took a nap and now i am watchin the Stanley Cup Finals. Pretty boring i know, but its all i got

       This CD kicks ass. Damn theres a lot more hits off this cd. But tonite kind of sucked even tho i did a good deed for the gpa by helpin him put up a coon fence to keep the damn coons away from the sweet corn. So, kathryn better keep cooney or whatever its name is away or else he will get a severe shock.    &nbsp;  I played some NCAA 2005 today pretty sweet game. I dunno did all the chores and crap nothing too interestin happened as usual to me, but tommorow is my bday so i guess its all good.

       It is really retarded when some people take things the wrong way. Like when they share something they know about a place. And you say what you know, not trying to offend their knowledge, about that place being that you live there and happen to know a little about the place. So this may all sound confusing to anyone but one person. I felt bad and all but she totally took what i was sayin the wrong way and took it as an insult and got mad for only god knows why. It was pointless to get mad over a silly little thing like that i dunno. Then it was written in a blog, about how someone was acting like they knew everything which i wasnt.. Its just stupid that some people blow things way out of proportion and get mad oat others for no apparent reason. O well this all sounds really confusing i know..    &nbsp;  But tonite was a good night i got to talk to my good friend Kathryn. She is really cool and its kinda sad tho that she is leavin tuesday night for the Ozarks and doesnt really know when shes comin back because they havent exactly decided yet. But its really nice to talk to her and she's really growing on me.    &nbsp;  Today was a pretty mellow day overall. i dunno did chores went to church a usual sunday i guess.    &nbsp;  Song of the day==Steve Azar- Till Monday

       So tonite&nbsp; I went out to East Potts fair just to check things out and of course to see kathryn. I guess no 2 fairs are the same and their fair is pretty nice actually its just more compacted than ours and stuff.     &nbsp;  The demo was allright i guess. This one time there was&nbsp;the lil&nbsp;4 cylilnders and there was only&nbsp;2 of them and they&nbsp;would never hit each other it was really sad and people were gettin mad and stuff it was kind of funny to watch everyone. The&nbsp;spot for the demo was kinda small and this guy&nbsp;kept gettin hit while he was already out and he&nbsp;was gettin really pist off and everyone was just laughin at him. Most of the time it wasnt the other drivers fault but im guessin the guy was just a dickhead.&nbsp;Kathryn and me walked around for&nbsp;awhile and i guess we missed the best demo of all but o well it was fun to walk around with her and see some of&nbsp;her cool projects and Maggie the cow. Then these people had tied their calves up to a&nbsp;2 by&nbsp;4 and if you know anything about cattle you know&nbsp;that cattle can tear that down so easily so i helped them get all those calves undone&nbsp;from the board and tied back up. Then me and kathryn walked around some&nbsp;more and stuff. and i waited for my mom to pick me up.  &nbsp;  I then had a Moolate from DQ id have to say they are pretty good but&nbsp;not the best i have ever had. Overall the day was pretty good i guess except for this afternoon when me and the bro had to dig out a runway&nbsp;with shovels it sucked ass.  &nbsp;  I need to go to bed, I already tried once but i dunno the caffine i had isnt allowing me too, and i cant stop thinkin about someone so i dunno i may not get to bed for awhile.  &nbsp;  Song of the Day-- "Hey Good Lookin"-by mister Jimmy Buffet and many other good country singers &nbsp;

        Hey everyone, I dunno im just kind of bored tonite. It's kind of been a long day because i had to go get the tire on the truck fixed since it kind of went out on me late last night which really sucked because i didnt have a phone on me so it was some walkin to do. Then my dad was pissed off at&nbsp;me all day because it was apparently my fault and i planned the flat tire or some other BS like that. Then the whole day he was bein gay making me and zach do pointless chores that had no purpose other than the fact that he wanted us to be doin something.  &nbsp;  I have been gettin checks in the mail from people i dunno for my trip. It's really nice and all but i dunno its kind of werid i guess. I like it tho that the communtities around me are being really supportive and all and it makes me feel realy good that people that dont even know me are congratulating me and sending money and all.  &nbsp;  So, tonite i worked with my calves and walked them a lot. It helps out a lot, then i walked my pigs and shit they need it, well just one of needs it because he is a fat piece of shit. The other 3 are doin pretty good and all so its goin allright in that department i guess.  &nbsp;  Today i also, made some of my world famous salsa, well school famous i guess since a lot of people like it at school, i made the green salsa tho its made with tomatillio's but its so good its nice and hott not too hott just really really good. and now the ingredients of my apple butter ar e metling so ill have to leave and go can that too.  &nbsp;  Song of the day...

      Listenin to some Jimmy Buffet, and kinda tired. Today wasnt so much a long day but it was just so damn hott that mowin the lawn sucked ass. I was on the rider and i was just sweatin bullets out there.  I didnt really do too much today. I did all the chores and i talked to my gpa. He is the man.  I'm now sittin here playin games on the comp. Billiards on Candystand.com is a must play if you like playin pool. I guess its just been a long day and i havent really talked to anyone except my friends from conference which are pretty cool and all, but i dunno its just not the same as talkin to some of my real good friends from around here.  Adios Amigos.  Song of the day: Clay Walker--Jesus was a country Boy

      So its been awhile since i wrote last. A lot has happened i guess too much really to talk about i dunno. Im just sittin here thinkin about how stupid i am for fallin for this girl again that i liked awhile ago and it didnt work out, but now its different i guess we talk a lot and have gotten a lot closer. I dunno after i told her i liked her last time we didnt really talk for a long long time and i just dont want to lose what we have right now.    Today was a long day, Woke up around 6 to sell the last load of fat hogs we had and then i fed the cattle and went to Dennison to the sale Barn. That was allright kinda of a ways to denison and the hogs payed out pretty well then we went to Bomgaars and bought a post hole digger pretty cheap. Got home and had to put in a new waterer for the sows because the other one broke then i came in for lunch and was so tired and took a lil nap. After that my dad woke me up and we fixed the mower then we mowed down by the machine shed and stuff. I then went over to my gpas to grind but the radiotor ran out of water and the gauge in the tractor is pry shot because it said the water temp was fine but it definitly wasnt and i had to take the cap off before all that steam blew the radiator up and i got that all fixed and it didnt look like anything broke. I got home and unloaded the feed then went to help my bro dig a line for the wire from the the direct tv satelite and then another one from the DTN satelite so nothing gets caught in the mowers. I then settled down for the night and came up and watched some tv and talked to ppl.  i talked to molly for the first time in awhile it was a good lil talk and she gave me some good advice. Molly is a cool girl. she congratulated me on me goin to WLC.  Song of the day.. She dont know how much i need her --Andy griggs dont know if thats the name of the song but its a real good song

      So i read meghans blog and decided that i should write a blog in tribute of her and that song because its such a great song. Its kind of funny because when i was at conference this song came on and i remember her tellin me how her dad hates so i was laughin a lil while dancin to the song. It was funny for me but others around me really didnt have a clue why i was laughin. Buy anywho meghan is a cool Chica and its good that Aileen is comin around with the whole country music thing, because country is good for the soul.  So In the words of one on of my fav bands Big N Rich.  Save a Horse; Ride a Cowboy   Talk to ya later Ya'll

      Well i have a post conference hangover. I had so much fun and now im tired and its not even a couple hours and i already miss the new people i met. I had the time of my life meeting all those new people and hangin out with the friends i already had from across Iowa. But now i have to come back to the borringness that is my usual life.  From the start conference kicked ass. I was a bit pissed off because me and Cody didnte get to be room mates because different areas cant room togethere so i had to a deushebag for a roomate. Seriously he had the beds moved together so i moved the beds apart and had to sleep with one eye open. So i just hung out in Austin and Seths room most of the time and we played cards which Cody sucks ass at. First of all he is terrible at BS and then he said "fine ill take all your money in Hold'em" and got all his money within 5 minutes tops, we had to stop callin him gay because he actually got a girl lol. We were all surprised.  The best part of the whole conference was the banquet, closing session, and then the Dances. Wow, conference is freakin the best for guys at dances because there are so many fine women that want to grind and dance with ya. Its unexplainable almost. The best was when jennifer was on one leg, whitney on the other and megan behind. THat was freakin heaven even tho God was pry frownin upon it lol. and Greta could shake it like no other as well as Jessie. THen allison god love her lol.  Funny things people said  *Seth "Damnit Austin look who its comin from" after austin said something *Me "Go suck a cock" to cody about every 2 minutes *"Sombitch" by just about all the guys lol *Me "Look they farted on our door" because these deushes across the hall smashed a *cupcake on our door. if you dont get it well you are s.o.l *Cody and his fairy tales *The fact cody lied about gettin some from Pencil Brow *The Duck Tape *Cody swordfightin with Pencil Brow and all the DUFF's *THe fuckin welt on my hand from seth and the AI rod lol the Pipets and greta thinkin they were pupets *Chelsea "So, where are we at in this program" all of us guys"Maybe the part where it says dinner" "Well i wasnt sure" and we were all eatin dinner. SHe was blonde  Weird Shit  *Seth and Austin wakin up and seein cory already in their room. Hes in a freakin other dorm building i still have no clue how the hell he got in every damn day. *My roomate, enough said *Those damn gothic people *Cody *Pencil Brow and all the DUFF's *Cody bein our DUFF that we send all the wierd ones his way   Conference was the best and the best part about it was bein me and meetin all these cool people.

      Okay so i come back from an awesome 7 days in DC, and the sad thing is ppl around here dont really care, being my friends well there are that certain few that do and it just made me realize what really good people HOBY ppl are imean really, pry the one person i think would have cared really doestn and its sad but i guess ill have to deal with that. Then, im basically off the earth for about 2 weeks b/c i had fair too and i get back and not to be concieted or sound i dunno like im so important but none of the ppl call or even ask what went on, and i actually feel bad for them at times because they didnt get to experience what i got to and its just so awesome. I dont even know if i could explain it to them or not but still. Then some of them are like where the hell ya been and im just like What the fuck you couldnt remember what i was talkin about for about a month before i left, but anyways i guess my friends are a lot different from my HOBY friends and im so much closer to you hoby-ers than i am to some of the ppl that i have been friends with for years and years and we were only together for 7 days, the rest of yall had 8 since i left early, and now that i have changed so much ppl dont really even know what to do with me its funny.   I will just start doin HOBY cheers by myself to remember the good times and my friends get embarassed and laugh at me but then i laugh at them b/c they are too afraid of what they look like to others instead of bein true to themselves. Im gonna be the best me i can be compared to no one else--My man Don Tocco  This blog is a good thing, it lets me at least try and express what im feeling and how much i miss all my friends from all over the world, and im actually kind of pist about the whole chat room thing and the fact its being gay and not letting me in and all but i have my good friend marie to talk to from OHIO. Shes awesome too bad we never really got to know each other at WLC, but now we are pretty good friends. *Moth SQUAD* baby GIT R DONE. lol im the killer guy from iowa.  I miss gettin up at 5, and goin to bed at 2 sometimes 3, and gettin very little sleep. i miss the shitty food and the caffine depravation i had. i miss starting up the Hey Burrito cheer anywhere especially in the mall when i got yelled at by security. I miss Ross sayin WICKED LOUD STYLE. I miss my Rhode island homies. I miss everything/everyone from WLC. You guys are the best and i dont know how to put it into words but i love all you guys and i miss you very much. Even if i didnt meet you are get to talk to you at all i know you are a very special person and i thank you all for being the very best you, you can be compared to no one else.

       So, i have been back now for a couple days, and i have realized how much normal sucks. Really, I miss fair, i miss all my HOBY friends as well as some of my friends here. I pry have the worst hangover you can have, you know the ones you have after you have some of the best times of your life and you come back to the normal routine and it sucks. I miss a lot of things, but mostly all the people i have met over the summer and the bonds i have made that are stronger than mine with some of my friends here. I spent 7 days with some of the best people on this earth and i have had such great experiences that i am so thankful for. And the worst part of it isnt missing all those people, its that my friends here just dont know what a life changing experience i had. I wish they could have had the experiecne i had, really i do because wow i just dont know how to put into words what i have had the honor and privaledge of experiencing this summer. The people I have met and made new friends with are just amazing and even tho we are miles, and even countries apart we still have this amazingly strong bond that will never be broken, and thats the thing about HOBY. HOBY is a life changing experience and you take out of it what you put into it, and i know at times i didnt put all of what i could into it.      Ray Pellatier is one of the best motivational speakers i have ever had the privaledge of being in the prescense of. He had some of the most motivational things to say and many sayings that are so true to my life.       Ray Pellatier    --"Let my mouth catch up to myself"   --"Not where you start, its where you finish"   --"You can start your day over at any time during the day"   --"Get rid of all excuses"      Don Tocco    --"I feel good, I feel great. Look out world, I'm comin out one more time!"   --"Be the best possible you, you can be compared to no one else"      Mariah Burton Nelson's 3 Lessons   1) Dare to Compete   2) Dare to Commit   3) Dare to Forgive      Los Ardientes are the best and thank you guys for the best week of my life you guys all kick ass. (Sorry I'm From Iowa) lol

      Well i dont really even know where to start from being gone so long, I left for WLC which was one of the best experiences of my life. It wasnt so much the speakers that made it worthwhile it was all the ambassadors even though i did not get to meet all of them, it was just great to meet all these differnet people from the differnet countries and then my group was awesome. F4 Los Ardientes. Really its too much for my lazy self to type and its something you would have  to experience to underestand or much less give a damn about, because its unexplainable to anyone who hasnt been to it. I come back and try to tell people but they just cant comprehend all that we did or the experience we had. I did some of the cheers like Hey Burrito, and people look at me like im crazy and its compeletly normal at HOBY.
