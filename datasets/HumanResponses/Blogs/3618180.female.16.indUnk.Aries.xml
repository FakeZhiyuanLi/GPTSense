      They'res so much about a trip that can be rewarding. Being on a bus for allmost a whole day sharing a toliet with 30 other people, stopping at every trucker stop ever made so that our hell of a bus driver named Garfeeold could make us wait forever to get going again while he takes his time w/ his daily crap or whatever bus drivers do at trucker stops, I truly think trips are so amazing. ha! I hope you guys dont really go pee pee in that sick thing on our bus though, and IF YOU DO, you should deffinately consider to never do that again in your life. But as the bus ride went along, I threw on my head phones and I slowly got away from everything. After we went through the top 3 INSEST STATES IN THE WORLD, and passed about a million trees and hills we finally arrived in Tennesee. That's where the horrible bus ride that we all dread to be on, ended. We got to Doe River Gorge and the expierence was unforgettable. All I can say about that camp is nothing but good stuff. I'm looking forward to another trip, I leave tomorrow and all though I only had one night w/ my pals in between the 2 weeks I'll be gone in the summer, I don't care much. All I know is that I'm about to get tan at the beach.

That's where the horrible bus ride that we all dread to be on, ended. We got to Doe River Gorge and the expierence was unforgettable. All I can say about that camp is that it is totally brillant, very good stuff. I'm looking forward to another trip, I leave tomorrow and all though I do wish I could have more then one night to spend w/ my pals in between the 2 weeks that I'll be gone during the summer, I can get a tan at the beach so I'm totally ready to lay out naked. I meannn naked? what!!! ha!!!
