       I'm going to suspend Flaming Dog Poo for now.  I'm not sure I can keep up with one blog....what makes me think I can keep up with two???  See what a couple of wine spritzers can do for me?  I put on my Wonder Woman outfit and away I go.  I'm having one of those 'morning after, rethinking what I did the night before' episodes.  Excuse me.

       It came into the library Thursday.  I was dreading it.  I hate seeing valuable library budget money spent on trash.  But, I recall my professors in library school touting the public librarians' theme song, "Give Them What They Want".  Apparently they want it because we had about 12 reserves placed on it already.  You have no idea how hard it was to not classify that book in fiction.  Then I had to wrestle it from the hands of our 78-year-old Library Board President who stopped by to see me.  He saw it sitting on my desk and wanted to cross the "F" out of the title ( My Life ).  Then he wanted to draw horns on Mr. Bill.  I was  SSSOOOOO  tempted to let him, but that would be defacing library property.  I hate being caught between personal feelings and professional ethics.  Damn.

       I didn't say anything when Hostess came out with the low-fat twinkie, but this is getting ridiculous.  I actually started another blog called "Flaming Dog Poo" for rants and stupid stuff like this, but I never really 'activated' it.  There's actually an FDP group of friends (which I won't go into right now).  I told my friend Christy that it might be time to get the Flaming Dog Poo blog rolling.

       I have to admit it.  I had more fun than I thought I would.  Let me start this by explaining that I am what is referred to as a "Lipstick Librarian"--I  am  a librarian, but I actually wear makeup, don't have a hairbun or own sensible shoes and don't list my cat as my best friend.  Hell, I'm  allergic  to cats.  Lipstick Librarians are a small minority in the field of librarianship, but we do exist.    Anyhoo--this means that places like library conferences are generally not hangouts for me.  I feel like I've gone to a convention of monks and geeks at these places, I generally have a hard time relating to others there, and it's just plain  boring .  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised at the enjoyable day I spent yesterday going through the  enormous  exhibits hall at the American Library Association Annual Conference in Orlando.  I cleaned up on free books, posters, and other goodies.  I was able to purchase an advanced copy of Carl Hiaasen's new book "Skinny Dip" (not due out until July) at the Random House exhibit, and I did some shopping for myself, my Dad, and my nephew.  One thing I purchased for myself was an Olivia doll to sit at my workstation.  Isn't she cute?         I'm usually not one to pay much attention to children's books, but Ian Falconer's Olivia books are just brilliant.  If you haven't seen them, take a peek the next time you're at the bookstore or your local library.  I picked up a great book for catalogers on authority work.  Authority work, in  very  brief, is all of those "see" and "see also" references you see in a card catalog.   Okay, so I'm a little geeky .  But I also picked up a poster for a book called  Jungle Drums  because it has a great picture of a monkey playing the bongos!!  I have to admit that I felt more comfortable at this librarian pow wow than I have at any other.  That's probably because there were a lot of non-librarians there, too, like publishers and techies, many of whom kept telling me that familiar line that I've heard a lot these past 10 years,   "You sure don't look like a librarian!!"

       My good buddy and co-worker, Celeste, yawns a lot.  And I'm not exaggerating--I mean  A LOT .  (Don't try to deny it, Celeste.)  I really wouldn't care, except that being around her all day makes me yawn, too.  Yes, I have that contagious thing.  The librarian/researcher in me just had to know why.  Here's what I came up with:   Why do we yawn?  The truth is that we don't completely understand why people, or animals for that matter, yawn.  It's widely assumed that yawning occurs because we are tired or bored or because we see someone else doing it, but there isn't any hard evidence to support these beliefs.  Scientists do not purport to know all of the biological mechanisms of the yawn, but tend to agree that a yawn is an involuntary respiratory reflex, which regulates the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the blood.  Technically, a yawn is the reflex opening of the mouth followed by the deep inhalation and slow exhalation of oxygen.  The very act of yawning is but one of a number of involuntary reflexes controlled by the spinal and nerve centers.  Scientists speculate that the onset of a yawn is triggered either by fatigue, or by sheer boredom as, at those times, breathing is shallow, and little oxygen is carried to the lungs by the oxygen-toting cardiovascular system.  When one yawns, his or her alertness is heightened, as the sudden intake of oxygen increases the heart rate, rids the lungs and the bloodstream of the carbon dioxide buildup, and forces oxygen through blood vessels in the brain, while restoring normal breathing and ventilating the lungs.  This quite plausible theory of yawning falls short of explaining many aspect of yawning.  Scientists explain away the "contagious" nature of yawning, that is when one person's yawn triggers another nearby to yawn, as due to the power of suggestion, but are at a loss when attempting to explain why yawning occurs excessively in patients with lower brainstem damage or with multiple sclerosis.  Other unlocked mysteries include why fetuses in the womb yawn, when it is a well-known fact that they do not intake oxygen in to their lungs until after live birth, or why individuals with high concentrations of oxygen in their blood streams yawn.  Until these questions are answered, do not assume that a person who yawns in your presence is bored with what you are saying, or suffers from exhaustion.  Simply be pleased that he or she is not bored to death.   Now, how many times did you yawn during that little gem?    At least I'm happy to know that Celeste isn't yawning at me all the time because I'm boring her!!!    HEAVEN FORBID!!!

       Yes, I  finally  got a picture up with my profile.  For those of you who haven't met me in person, it's just a glimpse.  I'm not prepared to splash my lovely face across the internet just yet, thank you very much.  I took it myself in my living room.  God bless cameras with timers.  Those are my bongos I'm hugging.  Don't I look happy?  Last night I briefly posted a caricature of me as the Mona Lisa with my profile, but I just wasn't happy with the way it looked on the blog.    If you blinked, you missed it.  Too bad for you.

       Get your mind out of the gutter.  Not  those  congas.   These  congas:   urlLink      My friend Ms. C. asked me today why I hadn't mentioned my new obsession in my blog yet.  Well, here it is, in all of it's spectacular beauty.  Yes, thanks to my brother Tom's drumming influence and the great skills of my conga guru Robert, I am now acquiring quite the Latin rhythm.  My boss told me he'll buy me one of the Ricky Ricardo shirts with the big ruffly sleeves if I play at the office Christmas party this year.  I'm thinking of taking him up on it.  I just  love  those ruffles.  I've got a set of bongos and 2 chicken shakes, too, but that's another post...........

            I'm having my own little microcosmic lesson in The Power of the Press.  Am I publishing political spat on the Internet?  No.  Is it a major news publication that reaches thousands of people?  Not nearly.  It's the Mount Dora Area Junior Woman's Club Newsletter--readership of about 20.       Now for those of you who haven't seen my newsletter, it's catchy.  I get lots of compliments from my readership.  It's a fantastic little newsletter (if I do say so myself) with lots of color graphics, funny tidbits, and pertinent information.       When I took over publishing my own little 'Time' magazine about a year and a half ago, I knew that people would be looking, reading, and paying attention to what they would be receiving in their mailbox every month.  What I had no idea of was that they would take what I was seeing as a monthly blurb about club events and turning it into  gospel.   If I put it in print for them, it  must  be true.  And if it's not in the newsletter, it simply  isn't happening .       Now don't get me wrong--I'm flattered that I have been given such amazing power over one of the most important dynamics of any group of people-- communication .  However, had I known that I wasn't simply regurgitating facts every month and that this responsibility was going to be laid at my feet, I probably would have turned down the job cold when I was asked if I was interested in doing it.       It gives me a whole new appreciation for editors at large newspapers.  Imagine if I had the control of, say, The New York Times?  My days of thinking that editors are simply English and Journalism majors are over.  They are power brokers.  Plain and simple.

        urlLink    HOOTY       Power went out yesterday--I hate that.  I hate having to reset  every  damn clock in the house.        I went out back to see if it was the big scary line that runs from the house to the main line across the back of the property. (I'm sure my Dad, the former electrician has a more technical name for this--for me it's simply 'big scary line').  I look up, and who do I see but this little troublemaker who lives in my backyard.  Yes, he's furry, and yes, he's cute.  But he riles up all the bluejays into a frenzy every night, too.  Little bastard.      Since I couldn't shoo the darn thing away I thought a camera might scare him off.  It works well for family members at holiday time.      Enjoy.

        urlLink         Where do I begin?  Well, for those of you who don't know--I have a penchant for (and a Bachelor of Arts degree in) art history. I LOVE art history.  And of course, who is the Queen of Art History?  Why, Mona Lisa herself.  Don't know why I have an obsession with her--I just do.  Ever since my mother told me that she was the most famous painting in the world.  And so it seems fitting to name this after her.  She is, along with journaling, a bit of an obsession for me.      Is this a journal for  me  or for  you ?  Well, that remains to be seen, doesn't it?  It's well-known that I work a lot out in writing.  It's very therapeutic, but yet I don't want to scare all of my family and friends away (it's a miracle I haven't done that already)--especially out here in VERY public cyberspace.        Hang in there with me, guys.      And special thanks to my friend Paul for turning me on to this new little work of art of mine.

        If you ever check my blog and see weird things, I'm probably working on it. I can't really complain about Blogspot and their image loading partner, Hello, because they are FREE, but like most free web services, they are also a bit clunky at times.   I am also trying to work on the look of my blog and make it a bit more colorful, but since I'm new at HTML it's taking me a bit of time (of which I don't have much of to begin with!).  This is  definitely  my 'work in progress'!!!!

       Christy's comment about parental support and the arts has inspired me to share one of my favorite memories of my parents.   In 1998 I&nbsp;submitted a stained glass piece I had done to the DeLand Museum of&nbsp;Art&nbsp;for a group exhibition.&nbsp; It got in.&nbsp; I was happy, yes, but I had exhibited before in college, so this was nothing&nbsp;really new for me.&nbsp;   It was to my parents.&nbsp; They are   not   art museum and gallery frequenters, and&nbsp;the closest thing they had ever seen to their kids' art&nbsp;being on display was having it tacked&nbsp;to the refrigerator. &nbsp;&nbsp;They told everyone they knew that&nbsp;  their daughter   had gotten a piece of art&nbsp;into the DeLand Museum of Art.&nbsp;   The opening was on a Friday night.&nbsp; I met them at the Museum&nbsp;after work.&nbsp; They were all dressed up and showed up with a big bouquet of flowers for me.&nbsp; I felt like a beauty queen walking around&nbsp;carrying those&nbsp;flowers.&nbsp; They looked at my stained glass piece closely&nbsp;and even tried to enjoy the other artists' works as well--inspite of the fact that most of it was very modern and abstract jabber.&nbsp; Then they proudly took me out to dinner on my 'big night'.   I realized how lucky I am to have such supportive parents--especially when they're being supportive of something that is not in their usual realm of experience.   That is one of those memories that will stick with me for the rest of my life.

        My friend&nbsp;Christy is a fabulous painter who&nbsp;doesn't exhibit her work.&nbsp; It's true.&nbsp; And she'll probably kill me for&nbsp;saying that on my blog!!!&nbsp; I'd love to see her exhibit something.&nbsp; I&nbsp;just hate to see 'hidden talent'.   I remember when I told my first photography instructor, Nigel Phang, that I wasn't an artist.&nbsp; He looked at me with this puzzled look on his face and replied, "Yes, you are.&nbsp; It's just been beaten out of you!!"&nbsp;  He was so right. &nbsp; What did Picasso say?&nbsp; Something about spending his entire adult life trying to learn how to create like a child again.&nbsp; It's sad how that happens.&nbsp; I think that is what the artist does.&nbsp; S/he tries to overcome those things that we've been told are 'proper' and 'improper'.&nbsp; That we are judged by how much we can immitate--not by how hard we try to blaze our own trails and express ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;God forbid we should&nbsp;stand out in the crowd and be 'different'.&nbsp;    You've all heard this before.&nbsp;    I'm not exactly sure&nbsp;why I'm pointing this out. I guess it's that I'm impressed with how far I've come in the last 10 years or so. I've done a 180 degree turn in attitude from "I can't" to "Why not?". Wherever you are now, Nigel Phang, you did good.   Now, having said that.....tonight my bongo master, Robert, said that he and I should play together at an upcoming opening at the Mount Dora Center for the Arts. Not as a featured concert, but just in a corner as background music. My first instinct was to think that I was  totally unqualified  as a bongo player to do this, and I don't want people going   Who's idea was it to have that girl try to keep a steady beat????   But then I thought,  I am what I am . These are artists, for crying out loud, and if I'm enjoying myself and trying my best on my little set of bongos, then who's to say I'm not    qualified    to play at an art gallery opening?   Yes, you guessed it--I have my Wonder Woman outfit on again.   Keep checking back here for my "Blonde with a Nice Set of Bongos" tour dates. ;-)

       It's happening again.&nbsp; About every 3 years I want to quit my job, pack my bags, and move someplace else.&nbsp; I call it my 'three year itch'.&nbsp; I'm convinced it's the impression left on my brain from being a military brat.   This is actually the longest I've worked at any of my professional jobs--3 years, 2 months. And I've lived in my house for 2 years and 5 months now. I'm breaking lifetime records!!   It's not that I'm unhappy with my job or house, it's that I get the yearning to live someplace new, meet new people, and explore new areas. I love moving to a new place and meeting new people and seeking out new grocery stores, drug stores, shopping malls, etc., etc. It's my way of being an explorer trekking through new territory. I love it.   I know, I know. I should just travel more. But, unfortunately, I always seem short on either time or money. My next vacation (1 week in the fall) will be spent painting the house.   Speaking of painting the house, I took down most of the screens today to start painting them, and I realized that I like the house better without them. Since about half of the windows are painted shut, any way, what the hell do I need screens for? I'm going to put them in the shed for the next homeowner to find (God help them).   I went to Home Depot this morning to pick out my colors from the Behr paint stand. God, I love picking out paint colors. I wish I had more guts than I do when it comes to color. Here's what I came up with:    urlLink    House    urlLink    Trim    urlLink    Doors   I know, you're just as excited as I am.

        Many of you know that in my lifetime I have been a member of&nbsp;almost 100 clubs and organizations (no exaggeration). My friend Shannon is the same way. We've also probably held about 30 different offices over the years between us.   Therefore, when Shannon and I, both single, noticed the sorry state of affairs here in Lake County for singles, we decided to take matters into our own hands. Along with Ruth at Dickens-Reed Books in Mount Dora, we're combining our experience to form the Lake County Professional Singles.   We'll be meeting on the 4th Tuesday of every month at 7:00pm; our first meeting is Tues., Aug. 24th. It's not intended as a 'dating service'. It's just a way to make single friends in a geographic area where most people are married and there are few opportunities to meet other singles outside of bars and the gym. We'll keep in touch via a Yahoo Group or something similar. No officers, no dues, no board, no budget, etc., etc. Just pure socializing.   Should be fun.

        How could I have forgotten the greatest blonde of all???&nbsp;  Definitely a blonde moment.  Tsk tsk!!&nbsp; That's okay.&nbsp; She really does deserve her very own post, any way.&nbsp;   All hail Debbie Harry.     urlLink     Debbie Harry

        As you know, I am a blonde.&nbsp; Not just in hair color.&nbsp; I have my 'blonde moments', too.&nbsp; I have always been proud of the fact that I am a blonde.&nbsp; But I've noticed lately that there&nbsp;is a new crop of blondes out there&nbsp;who are giving the rest of us a bad name.   Blondes were once the 'it' girls, and for  good  reason.&nbsp; It started with Jean Harlow.&nbsp; You've gotta love a woman of the 1920's who refused to wear undergarments.&nbsp;     urlLink        Jean Harlow   Then there was Marilyn Monroe.&nbsp; I don't think I need to say anything about Marilyn.&nbsp; Sure she was a&nbsp;messed-up pill-popper, but  what a blonde .      urlLink        Marilyn Monroe   Right behind Marilyn came Jayne Mansfield. Ms. Pink herself. I love the fact that she had 5 kids and still had that killer body. A personal trainer can't do that for you. You're just  born  that way.     urlLink        Jayne Mansfield   Then there's my favorite blonde of all--Angie Dickinson. How could you not love Policewoman? I think Angie is the epitomy of a  cool blonde . That sexy voice, the knockout figure, and she hung out with Frank Sinatra to boot. Enough said.     urlLink        Angie Dickinson   Now we come to the current crop of blondes--what I'll refer to as the "Blonde Hall of Shame".   I'll start with the worst one--Anne Nicole Smith. It's particularly annoying when people make the comparison of&nbsp;her and Marilyn Monroe. At least Marilyn married for love and she  tried  to hold down steady employment. Anna Nicole just can't pull off the troubled pill-popper routine in the romanticized way that Marilyn did.  We felt sorry for Marilyn.  Anna Nicole is just down right annoying. She looks like a big dumb stoned cow with a bad bleach job.     urlLink        Anna Nicole Smith   I didn't think it would be possible to be trashier than Anna Nicole. Then along came Christina Gag-uilera. Just look at the picture. What's that saying? A picture is worth a thousand words?  I just have one for you--UGH!!!     urlLink        Christina Aguilera   Then there's the latest blonde--Jessica Simpson. I thought I was dumb, but  not knowing that tuna fish is fish ? That's just inexcusible.     urlLink        Jessica Simpson   I'm not going to even get started on Britney Spears. I'd be up all night, and I have to go to work tomorrow and make a living. After I win the lotto--that's when I'll write a post about Britney Spears.   I'm beginning to wonder if cable is conspiring against us blondes. It occurs to me that a few of these blondes&nbsp;have cable 'reality' shows that are showcasing their stupidity, and the others get lots of TV time on cable networks such as E! and MTV.   Maybe there are a bunch of jealous brunettes in charge of these networks who've heard the "blondes have more fun" quote one too many times. Or maybe these new blondes are so dumb that they're just too easy targets to ignore.    Nobody  would have messed with Angie Dickinson in her hey day.

        Oh,&nbsp;good God.  &nbsp;  Ever since I returned from lunch hour I have been dying to&nbsp;take a nap.&nbsp; How the heck am I going to last until 6:00???&nbsp; Maybe I can fake a migraine and go home for the afternoon.....with some sympathy from co-workers to boot!!  &nbsp;  Friday afternoons should be cut from the work week.&nbsp; Let's be honest, nobody really does any work, any way.&nbsp; We just sort of go through the motions of looking busy.&nbsp; Or we do all of the piddly things that we need to do just to get our desks cleaned up before we take off for the weekend.  &nbsp;  I hope my boss doesn't find this blog.&nbsp; Since rumor has it that he gets his secretary to check his e-mail and print it out for him, I don't think there's much danger in that.

       Those of you who know me well know that I'm not too adventuresome when it comes to food.  I eat the same things every day, and you won't catch me in too many ethnic restaurants.  I'm too afraid of the usual repercussions that come with putting new and exotic foods into my digestive system.   You know what I mean .  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised at the experience I had last night.  My friends Carole and Robert talked me into trying a new Thai restaurant in Tavares (of all places).  I was hesitant, but in an effort to be social and not seem like such a bore I decided to brave it.  "You only live once", I told myself.  I stuck to something familiar--beef fried rice.  I enjoy the Chinese variety--I figured the Thai version couldn't be too different.  Much to my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Very tasty.  I tried some things from other people's plates, but I didn't particularly enjoy them.  Some sort of lemon grass soup--it was too, well,  lemony .  Robert had something with a name like Mai Pod or something.  It looked good.  It had a transparent noodle, and God knows, I love noodles (no Dr. Atkins diet on my bookshelves).  But there was some sort of peanut additive that scared me away.  If you can have an allergic reaction to it, I'm not touching it.  Now, I know you're reading this and thinking, "What's the big deal?".  You probably eat out a lot and try new foods all the time.  I'm telling you, this was a  big deal  for me.  But I'm so glad that I had such a great experience (with no repercussions, ahem) that I might try this again next week.    What next?  Indian food?  Mongolian BBQ?  Something tells me I'll have to work my way up to that.

       Have I told you I'm going to be an aunt again?  My sister-in-law is due August 3rd, but she'll probably have the little critter in July.  His name is Jeremy Thomas.  It seems odd that you can refer to someone by name  before they're even born , but that's life in the modern age, isn't it?  I have to admit that although I love being an aunt, I hadn't thought too much about this new nephew.  It's hard for me to think much about it when my only real sign is an expanding belly (sorry, Lydia).  But then it happened.  Last week one of our librarians brought around her new 2-week-old granddaughter.  She was gorgeous.  I really wanted to hold her, but I abstained.  I had been working with some old books and hated to think about the dirt and dust I had swirling around me.   Her name was Serenity Joy, by the way.  And although she was serene and a real joy, what the hell were those parents thinking with that name????  It certainly didn't come to them during childbirth, no doubt.   Anyhoo, just looking at that beautiful baby got me in the mood to hold one.  Then I remembered that we're about to have one of those cute little things in my family.  I'm getting excited now.  I can't wait to see him.   Do you think if I pick up my sister-in-law and bounce her like a big salt shaker a few times that might speed things along a bit??????

       It's not very often that I get so gaga about an artist that I would post their website here, but I just love Audrey Phillips' work.  I haven't met her, but I will.  She's just been approved to have a show at Mount Dora Center for the Arts in 2005.  I'm the chair of the Exhibit Committee there, so I should know!  My friend Christy and I both were tempted to purchase one of her works last fall when we saw it at the Orlando Museum of Art.  I have to tell you that her website really doesn't do her work justice.  It's much more vivid and colorful in person.  The works with the large eyes are amazing.  Really hypnotizing.  I can't wait to see the show.

       These are not recent, but they are 2 of my all-time favorites.  I actually took these back when I first started photography in college.  Thanks to Nigel Phang for his great intro to photography and my fantastic old Olympus OM-1 camera for giving me a great training ground.  That camera weighs a ton and doesn't have a single automatic feature--but I still love it!!!   urlLink    Biltmore Estate, 1993   urlLink    Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1994

       I'm talking about the prescription kind.  It's a good thing I don't have a job where I'd have access to a prescription pad or samples.  I'd be high as a kite all the time.  I had an allergic reaction Sunday.  Then fluid in my right ear from that didn't drain properly and turned quickly into an ear infection.  Sorry to gross you out, but I have to give you some background for my story.  I started with the usual OTC stuff--Benadryl and Sudafed.  Benadryl can space me out a little, and Sudafed can give me lots of energy (which I really didn't want at that time).  They worked somewhat, but they just didn't solve the problem.    This morning I went to see my highly-trusted Internist, and he gave me a little blue wonder called Maxifed.  I think someone blew out the whole right side of my head!   Wow, am I flying!!   It's too bad I'm at work right now, because I could really have fun with this.  Only 2 more hours and I'm back on the streets.......watch out!  I'm adding this one to my list of favorite prescription drugs.

        urlLink    Marlon Brando, 1924-2004  A big black cloud just came over my day.  Yes, I know he was a big oddball is his later years, but you have to look back to the 1940's and 1950's when Marlon Brando was the coolest thing  ever .  Not to mention hot.  Did you see him with blonde hair in The Young Lions???  :-D  Somebody grab my feet and pull me back to earth, please.  People always talk about Streetcar Named Desire because of the brooding sexuality and The Wild One because of the leather jacket and motorcycle, but if you really want to see a Brando masterpiece, watch On the Waterfront.  In addition to being Brando's best movie, it also has great performances by Eva Marie Saint and Karl Malden.  It is romance, love of family, and a moral tale all rolled into one. By far one of the best movies ever made.  I have an autographed photo of Marlon Brando hanging in my house.  It's probably fake because most are.  He was notorious for not signing autographs, so most Brando autographs are fakes.  But I don't care.  I still love it.  It's a gorgeous photo from The Wild One, and I think it represents the greatness that he was at that time.  In memory of Marlon, everybody say it with me once:  STELLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!

       Too bad he's dead.   urlLink    John Singer Sargent  His name is John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), and he was a painter.  He is most famous for his oil portraits of wealthy, famous, and titled people.  He was American, although he was raised in Europe and primarily lived his adult life in England.  He did love America, though, and refused a title from the King of England because it would have required him to renounce his American citizenship.  The first time I ever saw a Sargent was in Art History 101 class in college in the form of a gigantic slide projected on the wall--it was Lady Agnew of Lochnaw.  She was stunning.  The first "in person" Sargent I ever saw was The Countess of Lathom at The Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia in October 1991.  I spent literally hours sitting on the bench in front of that portrait studying it.  My first art history paper was written about it.  I could go on and on about Sargent, but I don't want to turn this blog entry into a dissertation.  For now I will tell you that I have spent hours in museums studying many of Sargent's paintings, and I have read just about every book about him.  I even went as far in the late 1990's as to write a letter to the Queen Mum in England asking her about her experience having her charcoal portrait done by Sargent in 1922.  A lady-in-waiting very kindly wrote me back telling me that the Queen Mum had no recollection of having the portrait done, but that she did mean to tell me that she enjoyed a recent exhibit of his works at the Tate Gallery in London.  I wasn't expecting the old dame to remember much after 76 years, but I was hoping for  something .  Anyhoo, I'm sure you will be hearing more about Sargent from me in the future.  He has become a bit of an obsession for me over the years.  I would have  loved  to have met him.

        Monday night I went to my first Undercover Party. I wasn't exactly sure what that was, either, but I had an  idea .   Lingerie and-- ahem --toys.      We started by taking a quiz and crowning our very own 'Miss Sensuality' in the group. I didn't win (no big surprise), but I did score fairly high ( very  big surprise). The fact that I once had sex in an elevator was a big help in boosting my score.  And no--I won't elaborate on that .      It was A LOT of fun. It's amazing how open a group of women drinking wine will get about what they've done and who they've done it with (and in a few cases, how many they've done it with  simultaneously).  I never thought of myself as any sort of a novice when it comes to these things,  but I was in this crowd ! They talked about devices and products that I never knew  existed .       Yes, I did buy a few things, and NO, I'm not telling you what they are. I'll just let you wonder.      I've decide to have an Undercover Party of my own in October. My Mom has teepee cake pans that I can use to make a cake in the shape of a set of boobs.

        The Orlando Sentinel contacted me yesterday about doing an article on  urlLink Lake County Professional Singles .  I should be speaking to a reporter within the next few days.  I'll post the article when it's published.        I hope what my psychic said isn't true--that she saw me planning a wedding within the next 6 months.  Kind of might put a damper on the whole singles group thing, don't you think!?!?!  Especially after all of this time and effort I've put into it!!      Or maybe I could bill myself as some sort of a 'success story'.  Hmmm........  Well, I think Philomena must have been tuned into someone else when she made that prediction, any way.  Although, everything else she's said has materialized, but that one's just too out in left field for  me .        If I were you, I wouldn't be thinking about wedding gifts yet.  I know me better than anyone, and I just don't ever see it happening.        Remember I said that--if I do  by some miracle of a chance  get married one day, you can make me eat my words.

        I went into my kitchen the other night at around 11:00pm. When I switched the light on I had a rather large roach sitting on my counter.  This is where flip flops come in handy.    SPLAT!!!    After following up with about a 1/2 bottle of Mr. Clean, I figured that for every  1  bug I see in my house there are probably about  50  more friends and relatives hiding out.   And then I just about threw up.   I cruised to one of my very favorite money drains--  HOME DEPOT  --and purchased a big jug of extrememly high potent bug-killer. I sprayed in every crack and crevice, around every window, door and appliance. I basically doused the place.  Then I got a headache, had to turn the ceiling fans on and leave the house for about 3 hours.   What the roaches learned:   You can run, but you can't hide.    What Jennifer learned:   Read the directions on the can first, baby.

        My friend Paul sent me   urlLink  this article    a few weeks ago. My first reaction was to write my doctoral dissertation right here on my blog about the general public's total cluelessness about the role of the librarian in society. But I will spare you all (somewhat).      I am a librarian. Do you know how often I go to the bookshelves to pull a book down for a patron? Maybe 4 times a year. Most patrons don't want you to pull a book down for them. I've never asked why, but the impression I get is that it would almost be on the same level of helplessness as cutting their meat for them. The only time I pull books down for patrons is when they are very old and don't have the strength or ability to reach high and hold the weight of a book above their shoulders.       My favorite line is when the brilliant researcher, Professor Pobil, refers to a library as a "semi-structured environment".  A little more emphasis on the "semi-" part of that statement  PLEASE .  He's obviously never been to his local public library during the 3:00 to 5:00 shift when it turns into the hangout for all of the neighborhood problems.      People are always amazed when I tell them some the things I've seen in my 9-year library career: people carrying razor blades inside their mouths, drug transactions, pedophiles searching for prey, destruction of property beyond belief, and on and on. One of my favorite stories is when I found a used maxi-pad sitting on a bookshelf. I guess walking 20 feet to the ladies room was too much of an inconvenience for somebody. I have dealt with the mentally ill (one had even 'escaped' and was still in her PJ's and hospital wristband), the fanatics (did you know that computerized library card catalogs are the government's way of controlling our knowledge???), and the violent felons. I have initiated more arrest and trespass warrants than I care to think about.       Don't get me wrong. I love what I do. I think the public library is the best place in the world. Where else can you get   FREE   knowledge (and nobody get me started on public schools, please)? I have met and had the privilege of helping some fantastic and fascinating people over the years. It just irks me when people think that as a librarian I sit behind a nice quiet little desk reading books all day. If only those people knew how ignorant that sounds to those of us who know better.      If Professor Pobil wants to create a robot to help out librarians, then make one that kicks Internet addicts off of the computer terminal after their hour is up.  Or magically turns off cell phones when they come through the front doors of the library.  Or knows how to herd rotten kids together and out the front door.      We'd probably name a dictionary stand after him.
