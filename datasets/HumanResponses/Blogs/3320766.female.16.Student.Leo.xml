      The skulls have holes made for a portal for evil spirits to escape from. They just drilled them in there when they were alive. How terrible. I wish someone would do that to me so all the evil things inside my head could seek out and maybe if that person is nice enough they'll take the chip out too. Then I wouldn't have to worry about people reading my thoughts and getting frightened by the things I see.

      Sometimes I can sit for hours just staring into space. It's like i stop being. I'm off somewhere else. But I'm really nowhere. No thinking. No hearing. No talking. Nothing. I am a vegetable curled up in a ball on the floor. Crying for something, someone, somewhere to hold me here in reality.

      It: Why don't you ever play with me? Me: Because you're not real It: How do you know? Me: Because no one else can hear you or see you like I can. I can't be the only one. It: They're all lying to you Me: All of them? It: They're all out to get you. If you don't come with me they'll destroy you. Me: They won't destroy me but you will  It: That is not true I am your friend. Don't you remember me my child? Me: No why would I remember you? It: If you come with me I'll tell you. Me: Then forget it. I have people I love here It: Like Scott. Didn't he dump you. He's just lying to you so you won't go and kill yourself. He feels sorry for you just like everyone else. I could love you - all you need is me. Me: He loves me you don't. You're not real. Besides we got back together. It: He won't even stay up with you. That's not love bitch that's hatred. Me: No if he would have stayed up I would have been controlling him and that's not what I want It: Why not control him? Me: Because he has his own mind. And I want him to be happy. I love him. It: ha you actually love someone. You'll hurt him just like you have every other guy that tried to love you. You push everyone who actually wants to be a part of your life. You make yourself miserable. You whore! You'll get him to hate you. Me: I'm not going to push him away like I have with others. I'm happy with him. I love him. He keeps me sane. It: Sane! You think you're sane. Look at you curled up in a ball, not being able to control you're own thoughts. You want to die, you wish for it, you dream about it, you can just almost taste it. Me: That's not true... anymore. It: How can something die like that. Just get it over with... end it all. Come with me. You will no more feel the cold stabbing pain. No more crying, no more curling up in balls on the floor, no more. Me: Yeah no more anything. Just total blackness and I don't think I want that. I want to live so just leave me be. It: I can't do that. Me: And why not. It: Because I am you.

      Things move too quickly for my mind. My thoughts come in illogical order and I can't see them. I see my thoughts as sometimes I see people - a big blurry blob as if I've been swimming in a pool for hours. I have to pick out certain thoughts and every now and then I slip and I can't speak just one thought - there are just too many. And at other times my mind goes blank and i don't know what i'm saying. Sometimes when my thoughts get too much for me I have a black out. It cuts me from reality chasing me into the Kingdom. My mind clears up. People say I act like someone else but everything gets switched off and I don't remember. I'll look at the clock - the bastards stole time from me!!! I'm finding things difficult to do, just everyday things. I forget to brush my hair, to go to sleep, to eat, to go to appointments. I get easily distracted and I can't concentrate on too much or I'll throw a fit like a wining child who doesn't get their way.

      Everyone is planning to kill me even the Shadows - Something my own mind created. What did I do to everyone to want me dead? All I do is sit and listen to their shitty pity stories and they don't even give me the time of day to hear my shitty hole stories.  My thoughts aren't right. I can't understand them anymore so don't ask me anymore advice. I'm insane I can't even listen to my own thoughts let alone anyone else's. I don't know why you want to hear what I'm thinking. Take the chip out of my head. No in fact I'll do it myself. I'll take this knife to my own forehead digging in the spaghetti called my brain. Maybe if I pour some tomato sauce in it maybe it will even taste good. Who knows it's no different from eating meat I guess except my brain will still be alive, still be thinking, still be ticking.

      The sound of a baby's cry sounds through out my head. I turn around and nothing's there. I walk a little farther and I see the baby in the middle og the road. A car is coming down the road. I wimper and turn my head dreading the thumping noise of the baby being ran over. It comes, Scott tries to comfort me. Thump thump thump. The baby is almost as flat as a pancake and is cut up and bloody. I cry there standing by the road watching the baby lie there crying and there's nothing I can do.

      A girl is eatting her skin off. She left some lying on the floor to make a doll out of. She rips out her hair and places it on the dolls head. She turns to me and screeches as if she's in pain. Her eye balls fall to the floor and roll to my feet. They look at me with their large black pupils still blinking. I hear two male voices that seem to come from the eyes. They whisper my name and tell me I should come with them. I can't talk I can't move I'm stuck in this place with this sight in front of me. Soon they say I will be theirs'.
