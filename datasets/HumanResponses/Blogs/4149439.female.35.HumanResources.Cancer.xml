      I am a chocoholic. But, I'm also a chocolate snob. Not just any chocolate will do. It has to be dark chocolate. Deep, dark, rich chocolate. Dove is one of the bests for a quick fix. Even better is dark chocolate covered raspberry jellies. Love em. Truffles are awesome too. There's a place in Wichita called Cero's that makes some wonderful, decadent chocolates. I've had to order them online & have it shipped to me in Florida since I haven't found that wonderful chocolatier here yet. They won't ship in the summer though, so I'm going through withdrawals right now.  I'm not sure that a day goes by where I don't have some chocolate. It just wouldn't seem right. The miniature Dove ice-cream's are wonderful. Ruby Tuesday's has a dessert called a Chocolate Tall Cake, it's chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, caramel sauce, whipped cream &amp; crumpled Oreo's on top. Mmmmm...

      I'm addicted to the game "Alchemy".  I played online & then downloaded the trial version &amp; finally had to break down & buy it.  I play it for hours on end.  It's horribly addictive.  I'll sit here with the tv on just moving rune after rune to the perfect square on the board.  I think I made it to 35,000 points, but I just know I can do better.    The first step is admitting to my addiction.  My name is Cat, and I'm an Alchemy-aholic.

      I read an article recently about songs that get stuck in your head for no apparent reason & then camp out there &amp; won't go away.  They've been dubbed "Ear Worms".  Just sitting here typing, I found myself singing songs from The Wizard of Oz (If I only had a brain...), then the damn gecko came on TV, so 'everybody was kung fu fighting'. It's just amazing to me how many songs are in our heads at any given time.  Face it, you can recognize songs with just a few notes. You know most of the words by heart & then just make up some for the ones you don't. And you know songs from all phases of your life which usually means you have a wide range of songs swirling around up there.  Not only that, but when a song comes on the radio that you haven't heard in a while, it can trigger memories & bring you right back to a certain place &amp; time.  As a kid, the house was filled with Frank Sinatra & 1970's AM radio. I grew up in the 80's so all the one hit wonders are stored away in the back of my brain somewhere just waiting for the right moment to immerge too. I loved watching musicals as a kid, so there's quite a few show tunes in there too.  It'd be one thing if the songs that were stuck in there were all good songs. But, they're not. There's a lot of really bad music in there &amp; it comes out at odd times and doesn't always go away cooperatively.  So what are my worst ear worms? It's mean to actually list them since then anyone who reads this will have them stuck in their heads too. Ok, why not? "Yellow Submarine" can be in there for days.  "I Could Have Danced All Night" from My Fair Lady is one that I sing continuously.  Pretty much anything from the Wizard of Oz.   "As Time Goes By" from Casablanca.  "It Had to Be You" from When Harry Met Sally.  The list goes on & on &amp; just plays continuously in my head.

      I'm just sitting her watching my cat "Dude" sleep on the couch. Then again, that's pretty much all Dude does. She's a fat, happy kitty. I really didn't want a cat, but was convinced into getting one a few years ago. We actually picked out the name "Dude" before we got the cat.  The first night we got her home was amusing. She disappeared for several hours and we couldn't find her. We searched everywhere. We though for sure she had gotten out of the house somehow & ran away. Then we heard a "thump" sound and she was suddenly there again. For days, she kept disappearing &amp; then re-appearing. But, we'd always hear that "thump" sound. Then one day I went to get a towel out from the cabinet under the bathroom sink & guess who was all curled up in there. We felt a bit better not that we knew where her hiding place was.  She sleeps, she eats. She demands to be petted occasionally and refuses to move off the blanket on the bed. You may think it's your blanket or pillow or couch, but when she's on it, it becomes hers &amp; there's nothing you can do to remove her.  She likes to groom my husband too.  She's almost licked his arm until it hurts.  I must not taste as good, because she'll take one lick on my arm & move on.   I swear the lizards outside tease her mercilessly.  They just run around in the backyard & jump on the sliding glass door as if to say "nah, nah, you can't get us".      urlLink

      It took some getting used to finding out that my boss is younger than me.  She's a nice enough person, but pretty flaky at times.  Luckily, she's easy going & me and the other gal in my dept can get away with cracking jokes at her expense.  She walks right into them & it's hard to keep our mouths shut sometimes.  Easy target.  I've been working on an online Exit Interview form that loads the data directly into a database.  So, I had to keep entering sample data to make sure everything worked right.  I told her I had quit about 8 times that day and that based on the ratings I put it, she wasn't doing very well as a manager.  I wasn't even looking at what the numbers meant that I was entering, just making sure all the fields worked.  But she was both offended and amused at the same time.  She said she was going to do one of those 360-feedback sessions to find out what we really thought about her.  I don't know about you, but how can you really be totally honest about your boss in a feedback session like that without it coming back to haunt you later on?  And my department isn't big enough to absorb the feedback & make it relatively anonymous.    Should be interesting to see what happens.  She told us she's back on her medications again.  Her sister was murdered last year by a boyfriend and needless to say, it's been very hard on the family & my boss especially.  Though I sympathize with her wholeheartedly, I still think there needs to be some separation between home & work.  It can make for some rather uncomfortable moments when she starts to reminisce or talk about what's going on with the trial, the family, etc.    I really do enjoy my job though.  I've carved out a little niche for myself & am happy with the outcome.  I've always been a computer geek, but never felt like I had enough experience to actually get an IT job.  Instead I putter around in Human Resources, but enhance my role in the department by creating webpages, a dept website, and other websites.  Right now, I'm finishing off a new website for Career Development.  This one is going to be pretty high profile and will get a lot of attention, so let's hope all the links work correctly!  My boss leaves me alone for the most part, which is good.  Compensation & Benefits is the part of HR I'm in, though I really only do the benefits part, while my boss & the other 3 gals do all of the compensation stuff.  So, I really have little in common with what they do.  Works ok for me though. We found out today that we may be moving into our new facility earlier than expected.  That'll be nice.  It's closer to my house & a much better facility.  The only downside is that our department will all be in one big room basically.  They've eliminated most of the offices & it's going to be very loud in there.  Get a few recruiters & the trainers going on phone calls & you can barely hear yourself think.  Might have to bring my headphones with me.

      Been watching the Olympics.  Glad to have electricity since Hurricane Charley was headed this way.    I've always like gymnastics.  I was one of those kids who watched Nadia get her perfect 10's back in the 70's and immediately signed up for gymnastics lessons at the YMCA.  I didn't get very far in gymnastics, I'm not exactly what you'd call flexible, but I still enjoy watching it & am amazed at the things they can do.    I watched a show the other night about gymnasts & how some of them have to decide at a very early age if they are going to turn professional or not.  The NCAA won't let them compete if they've pro, so they have to make the decision to compete in college sports or do endorsements while they're still in their 15 minutes of fame say from a win at the Olympics.    I'm always amazed at the number and intensity of injuries these athletes go through & still compete.  I don't know, I just think it's crazy to risk permanent injury that way.  Blaine Wilson landed hard on his back & head just the other night.  He was dizzy & skipped the floor exercise so he could gain his balance back.  The number of surgeries are just crazy.    The other thing that boggles my mind is how other countries train their gymnasts.  It's serious business.  I don't remember which country it was, but they were offering serious monetary rewards for athletes bringing home medals from the Olympics.

      Well, we got really lucky this time.  Everyone left work early on Thursday to prepare for the storm.  We're not in an evacuation area since our house's elevation is high enough to be out of the storm surge, but we were still a bit worried.  If Charley had followed its original path and hit St. Pete/Tampa, I doubt I'd have electricity or even a house right now.  It was a little nerve racking.  We cleared everything out of the back yard Thursday afternoon & just kept watching the news.  By the time we went to bed, we were convinced it was headed our way.    Friday morning we filled up the tub with water & anything else that would hold water just in case.  When they made the announcement that it had turned & wasn't going to hit us, we were so relieved.    Looking at the photos of the areas that were hit, I couldn't imagine having to deal with all of the damage cleanup.    I felt bad for the hundreds of thousands of people who did evacuate only to end up in the direct path of the storm.  We almost headed to my sister's house near Daytona & we'd have gotten much worse of the storm than we did here.  All we got was a few light rain bands.  Not to mention the traffic heading back here would have been horrible.    Well, now they're saying another one is on the way.  Welcome to hurricane season in Florida.

      Watched Clinton on the Daily Show tonight.  Gotta say, the guy has some charisma.  Not like Bush who can't keep from looking like a doofus whenever he opens his mouth.    Clinton & Jon Stewart made some good points.  Just hope we don't end up with four more years of the Republicans.

      It was a lazy weekend.  Made some chicken soup, some French bread, & curled up & watched movies.  Watched some old Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn movie, Yentl, Seabiscuit, American Wedding, & Terminator 3.    It rained again both days.  I'd love to get down to the beach one of these days.  I'm sure all of these storms have washed up a bunch of decent shells.  My roses are loving it.  There are new ones blooming every day.

      Everytime I hear Bush speak, all I can think to myself is "What a doofus."  I just can't fathom that this is the leader of our country.    I don't follow politics very closely.  It makes my head spin.    Two incidents recently made me wonder how many groups of people is he truly trying to piss off.    Not speaking at the NAACP convention in July.  He's the first president to not attend since Herbert Hoover.  What message does this send?   Then the one that really boggles my mind, pushing for a Constitutional Amendment banning Gay Marriages.  I'm just dumbstruck at this one.  I don't know that I can even express in words how ridiculous this is.  Why would the government have anything to do with who gets married to whom?    Family Values?  I looked up divorce statistics & something like 50% of first marriages are likely to end in divorce.  10% of the population has been divorced and the percentage of people getting married gets lower every year.  Face it, the definition of "family" has evolved over the years to something quite different than a few generations ago.  If a couple wants to get married, more power to them for taking that leap of faith.  It'd be nice if we had someone in office that accepted and embraced the reality of the world we live in instead of trying to pretend that the fictional world of "Leave it to Beaver" is representative of the 21st century.

      I'd been looking at Ipod's for a while, but couldn't get myself to shell out the money for one.  When my grandmother passed away last month, she left all of the grandchildren $500.  I guess it was fate that I should get my Ipod.  I bought it at the beginning of July and then not two weeks later they came out with the new & improved one for $100 less.  Luckily, I was able to take mine back to Circuit City & order a new one online.  I ended up spending pretty much the same amount of money though.  For $100 less, you no longer got the belt clip & that was something I had to have.  And since my ears seem to be extrodinarily small, I also ended up buying some different earplugs.    I gotta say, I really like my Ipod.  It took me a weekend to upload all of my CD's but it was worth it.  I've been listening to songs I haven't heard in ages.  I think I'm up to about 1500 songs now and I keep downloading more off of the ITunes site.  Songs I'd forgotten about, or ones where it was the only one on the CD that I liked so I wouldn't buy the entire CD.  But, now for 99 cents each, I can get all of those obscure songs I like.    I take it with me everywhere.  I connect it in my car & listen to it on the way to work.  I haven't quite put together enough playlists yet, but I'm working on it.  It's funny how when you put all of your music into one place, you realize just how diverse your tastes can be.   I'm a gadget person & have definitely bought my share of cool things that outlived their usefulness rather quickly.  I don't see my Ipod falling into that category.  Definitely a good purchase.

      I met Jon the first week of college.  He was a theater major and I had been involved in theater throughout high school so we clicked immediately.  He was so much fun, always grinning, always having a good time.  We were great friends & eventually started dating.  We'd sit out by the waterfront and talk until dawn.  We shared so many dreams, so many memories, we were in love.  Unfortunately, we didn't last long as boyfriend/girlfriend, we discovered we were better off as friends.  We'd get together every now & then when neither of us was involved with anyone else.  When we were dating, I had given him half of a coin charm.  I still wore mine on a necklace with a bunch of other gold charms & I didn't know what he had done with his half.  I'd visit him in Orlando on school breaks, or he'd come back early to school before the semester started & we'd hang out.  It was one of those relationships we knew we'd have our entire lives.   It was parents weekend, and I went to see him in the school play.  Afterward I was just going to head back to my dorm room, I knew he had family there to see him, but for some reason, I decided to wait around just to give him a big hug.  I remember he was all sweaty from the stage & he just gave me a big bear of a hug.    The next morning I went off to work as usual.  My roommate called me at work & told me to come straight home afterward because she needed to tell me something, but couldn't do it over the phone.  I didn't know what was going on.    When I walked back into the school, I ran over the list of everyone I knew thinking surely everyone was ok, I remember thinking the play is going on, so Jon's ok, and didn't give it a second thought.   When my roommate came into our room, she had no color in her face.  She sat down & told me that Jon had died in his sleep.  He was a big guy, and had told his parents he wasn't feeling well the night before & his heart stopped while he was sleeping.   I was just in so much disbelief.  There were no words to express how I was feeling.  I had seem him, touched him, laughed with him the night before.  It just wasn't possible.  The next few days were surreal.    We had been told to go speak to the dean if we were having a difficult time with it.  I went to see him & showed him my half of the charm I had given Jon.  I'll never forget the look on his face, when he told me that they had found Jon's half of the charm in his room & wondered who had the other half.  I laid Jon's half in his hand before they closed the casket.   A few months later, Jon's mother sent me some pictures.  She had discovered some undeveloped rolls of film in his room & there were several photos of me & him from a trip I had taken to Orlando to visit him.  It was so hard looking at those photos.  I missed him so much.    It's been 15 years and I still cry when I think about it.  Every so often I look through the photos, and letters, and drawings that I have from him. His picture is on my wall.  There are movies & songs that remind me of him.  He'll always be with me.

Not to say that they were all great cartoons by any means, but they sure kept me glued to the tv...   urlLink Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Road Runner & all the Looney Tunes . I couldn't wait to get home from school or spend several hours on a Saturday morning watching them all. Best cartoons out there.   urlLink Underdog  - Have no fear, Underdog is here... Sweet Polly Purebred, Riff Raff, Simon Barsinister and Cad ...   urlLink Tennessee Tuxedo  - will not fail!   urlLink Go Go Gophers  - watch them go, go, go...   urlLink Klondike Kat  - will always get his mouse &amp; Savoir Faire (is everywhere),  All the Hanna-Barbera Cartoons -  urlLink Atom Ant & Secret Squirrel ,  urlLink Captain Caveman ,  urlLink Superfriends ,  urlLink The Banana Splits ,  urlLink The Flintstones ,  urlLink Hong Kong Phooey ,  urlLink Huckleberry Hound ,  urlLink Pixie &amp; Dixie ,  urlLink Yogi Bear ,  urlLink Josie & the Pussycats ,  urlLink Jabberjaw ,  urlLink The Jetsons ,  urlLink Magilla Gorilla ,  urlLink Scooby Doo ,  urlLink Smurfs ,  urlLink The Laff-a-Lympics ,  urlLink Speed Buggy ,  urlLink Tom &amp; Jerry/Grape Ape Show ,  urlLink Top Cat ,   urlLink Fat Albert  - Hey, hey hey..   urlLink Rocky & Bullwinkle ,  urlLink Fractured Fairy Tales ,  urlLink Mr Peabody &amp; his Boy Sherman ,  urlLink Dudley Do-Right    urlLink Popeye  - Olive Oil, Bluto &amp; the who could forget Wimpy - I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.   urlLink The Pink Panther -  that tune will stick in your head all day  There was some show, maybe  urlLink Casper , where you would sing along with the bouncing ball.

      I'm not a morning person. I dread the sound of my alarm clock. Unfortunately, I have a 5am bladder though. I don't know if there's some noise outside, the newspaper delivery, garage door opening or what, but inevitably something stirs my consciousness & I have to get out of bed at 5am every damn day and can't go back to sleep until I go to the bathroom. Then I can go back to bed &amp; snooze for another 2 hours though.  It's been really hard to get out of bed lately though because of the rain. You just want to roll over, cuddle up, and sleep till noon.  Well, I better get in the shower then off to work. At least it's Friday, and payday too!

      I kept a diary/journal all through high school and most of college. I stopped writing in it when I was in a place in my life where I couldn't bear to admit to myself the direction my life was headed.  I was in a relationship with a guy I didn't love, and kept getting in deeper and deeper until I felt like I was suffocating. I was never physically attracted to him, but he was a nice guy and hopelessly in love with me and I kept trying to convince myself that it could work out.  He asked me to marry him & I didn't know how to say no. That's when I stopped writing in my diary. I had given up on me. I was depressed and would find solace in the arms of other men. Cheating on him became some sort of game. Was I trying to get caught? I don't know. I didn't really want to hurt him, but I couldn't find the strength to just get out of the relationship.  I went to Dallas on a convention for work and met a guy there that reminded me of a friend of mine who had recently passed way. Just something about him gave me the strength to tell my boyfriend that I couldn't go through with the wedding. He didn't take it well, but it was as if a huge boulder had been lifted off my shoulders.  Now, I'd love to say that I never fell into that trap again, but at the time I was notorious for making bad choices in men. I dated a former teacher, an attorney, and then a guy I had dated several years earlier. I ended up marrying the last one.  What a mistake. We had nothing in common. It was another situation where he was infatuated with me &amp; I thought that was enough. I will admit to being physically attracted to him and that was probably the only part of our relationship that worked.  Then the love of my life walked back into my life. We had dated on & off for 4 years while I was in high school. He was a senior when I was a freshmen. He joined the Air Force &amp; got married and we lost touch with each other for 6 years.  Then out of the blue, he called me. I was married at the time, but knew from the minute I heard his voice that I would be leaving my husband soon. Sure enough, 3 months later, I left my husband and moved across the country to be with my high school sweetheart. We've been together now for 11 years and I couldn't imagine ever being with anyone else.

      I admit it, I watch the Food Network.  It's a guilty pleasure.  Good Eats is one of my favorite shows.  Alton Brown is a quirky guy with a warped sense of humor.  He mixes humor, science, and cooking in his show and it just keeps me grinning.  He's also got an amusing little  urlLink website .

      Driving to work one winter day when I lived in Wichita, I looked over at a field of cows & noticed frost on their backs.  Sure, I'd seen frost on the ground, the trees, the houses, but it never occurred to me that cows would have frost on them too.  Cow-sicles?!  I don't know why it struck me as so odd or why years later I still can't get the phrase "Frost on the cows" out of my head.

      I was flipping channels the other night on the TV & "When Harry Met Sally" was on.  I couldn't help but watch it.  It's just one of those movies that catches me every time & it's still funny every time I watch it.  So, I got to thinking, what other movies am I destined to watch over & over again because I just can't change the channel...  Blazing Saddles - "Mongo only pawn in game of life"  Chocolat - Johnny Depp is decadently delicious in this one.  Hudson Hawk - Pretty bad Bruce Willis movie, yet I'll be singing "Swinging on a Star" for days afterward  Bull Durham - Kevin Costner's smirk is something I just can't pass up.  "...and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days."  Tin Cup - Same thing - Kevin Costner just has that sly look in his eyes  George of the Jungle - Brendan Frasier never looked better.  The scene with the horses still makes me swoon  Moulin Rouge - The first time I saw this movie I sat in total disbelief.  I thought it was so bad.  Then I watched it again, and again, and dammit if Ewan McGregor didn't just win me over  It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World - I can remember watching this movie as a kid & thinking it was so crazy.  Every big named star from the era was in it & I could never forget the big W  Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory - Classic movie &amp; every time I watch it I notice something new or just how frightening Gene Wilder can be  Ocean's 11 - The George Clooney version, though the original was pretty good too.  Great cast of characters & a slick heist  For the Birds - It's the short film they played before Monster's Inc.  It makes me giggle hysterically.  Good Will Hunting - My favorite Matt Damon movie.   Dave - I can't help but watch this one everytime it's on and wonder what it would be like if someone got in the white house & just made an effort to balance the budget  Independence Day - Will Smith blockbuster with serious flashbacks to War of the Worlds, but it catches me every time  I know there are a lot more, so I'll keep adding as I find myself curled up on the couch watching them for the umpteenth time

      My favorite line out of the first one was "There is no spoon". Loved it. The first movie will certainly go down in movie history. The special effects were unique & groundbreaking. So many movies, and even commercials for that matter, have taken what they saw in the original Matrix and used it time &amp; time again. So, unfortunately, it is all quite old hat to see the stop motion effects. I do believe the first one could have stood the test of time on its own without the sequels. Sure, there were unanswered questions, but I could have lived without knowing. It was just a flight of fantasy that kept you completely mesmorized for the entire movie. You wanted to understand what it all meant and it made your mind go off in all sorts of directions trying to figure it all out.  The second one was filled with so much action that you almost lost sense of the story. I went in to it looking for answers, and probably tried to pay too much attention to what was going on. Going into it, I knew that it cut off mid movie to make way for the third one. I felt that there was a lot to be learned when he was in the white room with the Architect, and that's one of the reasons I want to see it again. The action sequences certainly make your heart beat faster, but I think some of them just go on for too long. Even the car chase scene, though quite spectacular, went on for longer than necessary.  The third one seemed to go by very quickly. There seemed to be few key scenes & the rest just filler. When it was over, I couldn't believe that 2 hours had just gone by. The special effects were incredible. I think the one that got me most was the swarm of the machines coming through the hole in the dock. There was just one shot of it where it really swarmed &amp; I think I gasped. As Neo would say, Whoa! I felt that some of the scenes were way too long and there really didn't seem to be a lot of dialogue, just a lot of fighting. Though swept away by the images, I still wanted to understand more & wanted one of the characters to truly explain to me what it all meant.  Now the ending was quite a surprise to me. I've read articles about it from the Wachowski brothers who say that it's a trilogy, but obviously they left it wide open. The disappointment will be if someone else tries to expand on the franchise and continue the story. They obviously had a vision of what they wanted the Matrix to be and perhaps they've decided that maybe like George Lucas &amp; Star Wars, that they will come back years later & add another trilogy to the mix. Though I think George Lucas had the backstory of Star Wars already conceived.  Speaking of Star Wars for a moment... Again, the first one was groundbreaking in every way. The second &amp; third installments were good, but could never match the intensity of the first one. And I have to say, I haven't been completely impressed with the latest installments. Lord of the Rings, however, has been much better I think at making 3 very distinct movies that seem like masterpieces of their own. I think there's a distinct difference between movie classic & cult classic. LOTR will go down as a movie classic. I believe the Matrix trilogy will be a cult classic.  Ok, what does it all mean? In the simplest terms, good vs evil, God vs the Devil, heaven &amp; hell. But, what we discover is that there has to be a balance between the two. You can't have one without the other, they are co-dependent. The main characters, Neo & Agent Smith are really not the distinction between good &amp; evil, they are merely counterweights, so to speak, in the balance between the two. I believe the Oracle & the Architect are truly what make up the balance. As in the last scene, they are able to sit together peacefully &amp; talk, despite being on either end of the teetering scale between good & evil.  Neo's being blinded to be able to see. I saw his blindness as representing justice. I'm sure you've seen the image they use in courtrooms where there is a woman holding the scales of justice &amp; she's blindfolded. I found a quote on a statue of justice:    'Blind Justice' often reaching out with no vision of what should be in the world and caught in the trap of what cannot be changed .  Neo was unable to change the fact that good & evil exist, but he had to make the choice to balance it out again by sacrificing himself because Agent Smith was making the scales tip too far in one direction.  When you look at both sides of the scale, on the side of good, you see love, honor, respect, passion, pride, free will, belief, faith and then on the side of evil, you see hatred, the quest for power, dominance, conformity, control. Agent Smith tried to tip the scales assuming that he could dominate the world, real or within the Matrix, but, not understanding the fact that the balance has to exist. When he absorbed the Oracle, he became unbalanced. Neo discovered that to rebalance the scales, he would have to help the machines destroy Smith. He had to be blinded to the fact that he was in essence helping his enemy, that which he thought it was his sole purpose to destroy beyond all else, in order for the ultimate balance between good &amp; evil to be restored. He had to sacrifice himself & his beliefs on what he thought was good &amp; evil in order to see the bigger picture.  Neo could have gone on fighting Smith forever. He was trying to balance out his end of the scale. Believing that he had to stay & fight to keep evil from winning. Not until he heard the Oracle speak from within Smith, did he realize that she was now acting as the counterweight and that by allowing himself to be absorbed as well, together they would unbalance Smith &amp; tip the scales back in their direction. When all was said & done, only the Oracle remained, both Smith &amp; Neo had to be gone in order for the scales to balance again between the Oracle & the Architect.  So, is Neo dead? I would say no. He is, afterall, the One. I believe that the machines would reintegrate him back into the fields &amp; that if the balance becomes unstable again, the Oracle may try to release him once again.  What is the little girls significance? Hope, the future, the dawn of a new day, innocence. Her parents knew she had to survive and the Oracle sent Seraph (an angel, an attendent of God) to look after her. The meaning of Sati (the little girl's name) is a woman who is true to her ideals. In the mythology she sacrificed herself for her ideals. I don't believe the name Neo has any significance other than the rearranging of the letters gives you the "One". Many of the names come from mythology or religion. Morpheus was the Roman god of sleep & dreams. So, he has the power to release people out of the Matrix, their dreamworld.  The machines &amp; humans co-exist. The machines need the humans to supply them with power, the humans need machines to live as well. They weren't fighting off the sentries with sticks & stones, now were they? Again, it's just a necessary balance to keep existence stable. Will it become unstable again? Of course it will. There's always going to be an errant program in the mix that seeks power over the rest. Did Trinity have to die? Yes, otherwise Neo would have continued to try to fight Smith, unwilling to give up the hope of being with Trinity again.  Again, it's all a matter of balance. Life &amp; death, fear & courage, love &amp; hate (I side step here a moment to say that I don't believe love & hate are opposites, I believe love &amp; indifference are opposites, to truly hate someone you are still completely obsessed with them, but I digress), dominance & subservience. Having the ability to choose, to exercise free will, to stand up for what you believe in no matter what anyone else thinks, or says or does. Knowing that you can make that choice, right or wrong and that you only have to answer to yourself versus being told what to do, that you have to conform, that you can't be an individual, that you must be like everyone else.  Ok, I'm going off on a tangent here, way beyond the movie itself, but look around you. Look at the people you know, look at what you see in the news every day. The world is so full of hatred, of intolerance, of people, dictators, who want the rest of the world to be like them and to destroy everything and everyone who tries to stand in their way. I look at the world more analytically, more logically than a lot of people.  There are a lot of times where I feel like an outsider in the world looking in. I'm forever speechless when I hear some intolerant idiocy escape from someone's mouth. It can be a derogatory comment about someone's race, sexuality, beliefs, whatever, or as simple as the boss saying that whomever is too fat or not pretty enough to sit at the receptionist's desk. I believe so many people are oblivious to the fact that they really should consider what they say before they say it. It's like they're missing some sort of filter between their brain &amp; their mouth.  Anyway, all in all, the Matrix trilogy had a lot to say about mankind, the struggles we face in determining right from wrong and the choices we have to make in the long run. On the surface, it was a very entertaining romp in science fiction. If you dissect it, as many people are in the process of doing all over the internet, you can come up with many, many conclusions of its meaning. I read some other people's opinions. Some I could accept, some I thought were far-fetched even beyond what I've concluded. And, I'm sure even if the Wachowski brothers were prone to divulge their true meaning of the story, it would probably be quite different than what any of us came up with on our own. And that's the great thing about choice and having free will, we can come up with any conclusions we want to and believe them regardless of what anyone else tells us to think.

      Ok, how is it that the entire country has gone carb crazy?? When did carbs become public enemy number one?  I've never understood fad diets or dieting in general. Am I overweight? Sure, isn't everyone to some degree? I've probably got 5 to 10 extra pounds on me at any given time. Do I know how to take them off? Yup, eat a balanced diet & get off my ass once in a while. That's it in a nutshell.  It's not rocket science. Eat vegetables. Eat fruits. Eat grains. Drink a lot of water. Eat something from all of the food groups on a daily basis. Don't eat entire pints of Ben &amp; Jerry's Phish Food ice-cream or shovel down Big Macs, Whoppers, and fries every day.  Then after you've eaten your balanced meal, go for a walk. That's it folks. Just go for a walk for about 30 minutes a day & you can shed those unwanted pounds.  Sitting on the couch every night eating ice-cream, potato chips, and fast food will put pounds on you quicker than you can imagine. And face it, once you enter your 30's those pounds seem to go on pretty quick, but take a whole lot more time to take off. A few years ago, I dropped 20 lbs and dropped my cholestoral by 50 points in 6 months by changing the way I ate &amp; walking 30 minutes a day. It doesn't happen overnight.  I'm just amazed at the whole Atkins craze though. Every advertising agency in the country seems to have jumped on the Atkins bandwagon. I can remember when calories were bad, then it was fat grams, then it was sugar, then it was cholestoral, and now it's carbs. What's next?  I don't care what anyone says, the majority of people cannot commit to a diet that excludes certain foods for very long. They eventually fall back into old habits and begin eating what they want & start putting the pounds back on again.  Losing weight &amp; maintaining the weight you want is a   lifestyle change  . It's not a diet. It's deciding to make changes that you can live with for the rest of your life. How long before the Atkins followers get tired of taking their hamburgers off the buns?  Well, I for one, enjoy carbs. Pasta, bread & potatoes are some of my favorite things. In fact, I recently bought a bread machine. Mind you, I ended up having to order it online since no store seemed to carry them anymore.  Someday we'll all look back at the Atkins craze and wonder why carbs were suddenly deemed evil. For now, I'm more than happy to go to lunch with people on the Atkins diet. I just sit there gleefully &amp; ask them to pass me the rolls.

      I've been in love with Howard Roark since I was 15 years old.   I've read Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged" so many times that the covers have all but fallen off my books.   The books inspire me, make me feel as though I can do anything on my own.   Above all else, I value my independence, my ability to see what I want & make it happen.   I've never understood people who wait for life to happen to them.  Who expect that everything will just be handed to them or that someone else will take care of them.  That the problems in their lives can't be overcome because someone or something else is holding them back.   Howard Roark was passionate in so many ways.  It's the drive, the desire within him that gets him to his ultimate goal.   Who is John Galt?  He's a character that I'll always remember, that I know I can go back to whenever I need some inspiration.   I just hope that somewhere out there, they actually exist.

      It's been raining for days now & when that happens I usually get introspective. Figured it was time to get those thoughts out of my head &amp; out into the world.  The books of Douglas Adams amuse me to no end, so I figured what better place than Milliways to ponder Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything.
