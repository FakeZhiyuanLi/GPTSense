      1. Not to drink for two whole weeks 2. To cut my smoking at least in half 3. To drink more water and less aspartame 4. To get more cardio in 5. To force myself to relax every night before bed with breathing exercises. 6. To quit relying on spell-check and use my dictionary more 7. To start reading again. 8. To push myself into seemingly scary situations that will benefit me in the long run 9. To hunt, hunt, hunt, until I get a job. 10. To eat less cheese and more veggies 11. To catch myself before I fall into a bad mood slump 12. To give Cute more attention and love 13. To surf the net less and write fiction more 14. To stop being so hyper-sensitive 15. To stop starting fights with people at bars when I get drunk. 16. To say no to a pitcher at breakfast.  I'll keep you posted on my progress, or regress as the case may be. By the way, I did the how old is your body quiz and I am pleasantly suprised to learn that I am only 29 years old.

      "Write!" "Every week!" "No, WRITE."  --Margaret Laurence, The Diviners  I probably misquoted, but who gives a shit.  Dumped.   M, over the phone, "I'm sorry, but you scare me." (can't say I blame the fucker) J, over the phone, "Someone else has caught my eye." (at least the bastard had the balls for honesty but damnit he beat me to the punch shy of a breath) A, over the phone, "I guess there is a reason why I haven't returned your calls for two weeks and that reason is, I need to be alone." (said he, while dating someone else) L, in person, on the roof of the Rideau Centre, "I need some time to myself; I'm really disillusioned." (translation: I still don't know, but my guess is, "I'm horny") L, in person, at my house, in my basement, "I just don't love you anymore." (no comment necessary--you prooved that much in the sack, fuck-face) J, in person, at Zaphod's, "here, --hands me a Weezer CD-- this should explain everything." (it didn't, though yr taste in music sure made things easier to swallow) I, over the phone, "I never really thought we were dating." (ouch) N, in person, over the phone, and over the phone, "I'm just not happy anymore."  Well, boys, I wonder what has become of you..if only for karma's sake, I wish you all the best.  Last night I ran into Glenn Humplik. I gave him my autograph and told him, "hold onto this, Glenn, you'll see, one day it will be worth something."  ???

      Like really?  I am so depressed right now.  I am so fucking angry and bitter and sad and fucking hell writing it out changes nothing, makes me feel no better, does nothign but turn me off.  Fuck you. LIKE REALLY,  FUCK YOU  What did I ever do to deserve this?  Ok, well now I feel like a fucking psycho and I have two cigarettes left and I have no money left at all--like, completely fucking broke-- and I have no drive to do all the things that need to be done next week and worse yet, I'm disgusted at myself for whinning about this.  So I think the best thing would be for me to sign off now before I grow any more disillusioned with the last place I ever saw myself winding up at the age of 23.  Who woullda fucking guessed, eh?  HA!  God, this entry just made me feel even worse. Fuck you too, blog,

      "I don't know, because you are?"  "I'm having problems assuming the role of actress in the real world." "Why's that?" "Actresses have scripts. And all the other actors do too; they know each others' next lines as well as they know their own." "Hmm, good point. Have you ever done improv?" "Yeah, I have! I used to love improv!" "There you go."  You can't control anyone; the only person you can control is yourself.

      "Reciprocity is not the issue at all."  Discouraging that he uses "the" instead of "an" when refering to "issue". "The" suggests that there is indeed another issue responsible for not getting involved; whereas "an" would've open a window of possibility, implying there is no other issue for not getting involved.  Encouraging to note how he ends the sentence with "at all". This unnecessary insertion stresses the meaning of the sentence as a whole. While he could've written "reciprocity is not the issue" and left it at that, he chose instead to emphasize the fact that "reciprocity is not the issue" by adding "at all". This interpretation, however, doesn' take into account the possibility that maybe he is just far too nice to write anything that blunt (because if you think about it, "[r]eciprocity is not the issue" does have a cutting, almost condescending edge to it; whereas, "[r]reciprocity is not the issue at all" carries a softer, more soothing tone).    Encouraging to note that he avoids the use of contractions in the typing of "is not" (even though throughout the rest of his e-mail, he employs loose and colliquial languge, even relying on point form and initials). There must be something extremely important in this particular sentence, something so terribly important to convey that he refrained from writing in the chummy and unromantic form that characterizes the rest of his e-mail.  And to think that's only about 25% of the e-mail. I could write a novel on you, dude.  Well, I'm glad none of this transpired over the phone; I'd be royally bored right now with nothing to analyze but my shoddy memory of it.  Hard copy, hard copy, it's all about the hard copy!

      "Hi, I called earlier about-- "Oh! So you're shit-face." "That's what they call me." "Right, right. And you lost your jacket." "Right." "Maybe you shouldn't drink so much, shit-face." "Yeah, that's what my therapist says. Minus the cussing, of course." "Nah, I'm just joking. I get shit-faced all the time, myself. I know what it's like. You lose things. Like me, when I drink, I lose my keys, my girlfriend, my house." "Stab in the dark, but brain cells to boot?" "Sure, you name it. So lemme go look for yr coat." "Thanks."  Tap tap tap my foot against the floor. Knock knock knock my knucles on the bar.  "Sorry sweetheart, can't find it." "Really?" "Yeah, I'm sorry. It was here on Monday, that's why I told you to come by, I thought it'd still be here. But now it's not." "Okay, well, if it turns up-- "If it turns us, we'll give you a call. Do you have a pen?" "Yes."  drunkbridesmaid, ___-____ re: lost coat, black with hood and l'il ska pin. thanks.  "Alright, then. We'll call you if we find it." "Cool."    Double asshole.

      In front of me is a calendar. If I were writing an e-mail to you-know-who, I would've consulted a dictionary to ensure that I'd spelled calendar correctly. But since it's just me and my loyal readers accessing this page, I won't be bothered. No offense.   Point was, I see thirty days in June. I intend to cross each day off with an X before I go to bed each night. Then, come the first weekend in July, I will allow myself to send this e-mail (after much editing and re-wording, I'm sure)  The cool thing for me to do is to leave the ball in yr court where I'd promised to leave it a month ago in my last e-mail to you. But, much like a cat, I'm bound and determined to meet a messy, awkward end, with my curiosity overidding my coolness. Coffee? Beer? Anything? Oh, just give me a chance! Please! I haven't been able to stop thinking about you! I daydream about what our bookcases would look like side by side.   I daydream about that a lot. I imagine people coming over to our apartment and checking out our collection of texts. Hmm, whose is this? And whose is that? I think our books combined would have a very pleasing aesthetic effect on our guests.  How's this for irony: let's say he did dig me and was moments away from calling or e-mailing, but stumbled across this blog first. Ha! Like I said before, I'd take off running myself, but I wouldn't get far.  Well, obviously, I wouldn't send all this in my e-mail. It'd end somewhere around "Anything?"  I'm embaressed by this post. Can you erase them later if you don't like 'em?

      Crush. It's such a suiting word.   Add two letters,  You've got, crushed.  It takes only two. And yet it takes two.  Blah blah blah blah  I have not worked a single day of May. I have not gone to a single class. I have not volunteered a single second of my time.  And my days have been killing my inspritation and my nights have been killing my brain cells. --and yet, as always is the case with me, a fool who only really experiences and appreciates an episode once it's passed, in a month from now and for the rest of my life, I will look back at this month of May and long for the solitude and boredom.  If I had money, I would --go to Montreal for the weekend --buy myself a new item of clothing --visit my family in T.O. --coerce one of my friends into drinking alongside me at a bar right now --buy myself a hotel room, listen to music all night, write, chain-smoke, and dance in front of the mirror  Aha! On a positive note, I have not been on a date with MaryJane since ___ dumped me.   And who's the addict, ___?

      Imagine people applied for relaitonships in the same way they applied for jobs; get all dressed up, go hunting, hand them a summary of all your fine points and valuable experiences, not to mention contact info, envelop summary in an impressive and engaging cover letter, and follow-up with a call back, eventually get called in for an interview, primp yourself, practice your responses, make sure to not talk too much, or too little, smile and make eye-contact..I think I'd have more success if we functioned that way, instead.  __________,  I am writing to express my interest in the upcoming position of girlfriend for _______ inc. ________ inc appeals to me because of it's attractive building, it's friendly and laid back atmosphere, it's high productivity levels, it's ethical and compassionate stance on global and national political issues, it's employment security, and it's rewarding fringe benefits. I feel that I would be a valuable asset to your company as I have both long-term and short-term relationship experience, an extensive and expert background in physical relations, and an unyielding passion to settle down in a challenging but fulfilling position such as the one currently available at ________ inc. If hired on by ________ inc, I would not disapoint you. A position like this comes along only once in a life-time, and I am ready and willing to compete for it because I am certain that I am the woman for the job (oh yeah, that job, too).   Sincerely, drunkbridesmaid

      I have this life-long habit of sitting on my ass waiting for shit to happen. All my life I've gotten by just by sitting on my ass. Shit has happened on its own or others have done it for me. My time has run up, this much is obvious. It's time to throw in some elbow grease. But I love being lazy--who am I kidding? Seems like the only things I've ever really thrown myself into have been drinking, day-dreaming, and men. Everything else I've indifferently and effortlessly waddled my way through, like a fat woman spreading the folds of her ass to take a shit, minimum effort, mediocre results. All week I've been making horrible analogies--this has got to stop! I just ate an egg, went for my 15th smoke of the day, and checked my e-mail for the thirtieth time in 5 hours. Then I hopped around the living room singing, What does drunkbridesmaid wanna do with her life?  Then I got tired of that, sat on the couch and stared at the wall for fifteen minutes. Someone came to the door. I could see it was a woman I didn't recognize with a clipboard in her hands. I hid under the coffee table and giggled as I watched her try to open our screen door. Ring, ring, ring. No answer, hee hee. Hee hee. Eventually, she hung some flyers on our mailbox and left. Finally I hoped up and jumped around the living room cursing, "Fucking hell, why won't someone, get me job?!?!" Then I decided to check my e-mail again.

      "moot" and I learned a lot more, too.  But whatever, the point is, I am drunk  and not off my beer! Oh fuck, I gotta buy some to replace that I drank.  But whatever, the point is, I had this nightmare last night and it involved checking my email. There was more to it than that; other wack and scary shit was going on--me at some point decapitating a monster-woman with a really rubbery neck, skin dangling down like a fat chicken cartoon or something--it was like Kill Bill in terms of the gore and violence but also really eerie with the tone of an indie-suspense flick.  But whatever, the point is, When I woke up, Cute was satring wide-eyed at me, an inch from my face and I swear I almost shit my pants, thinking, my god, my cat is evil, she's possessed by the devil, it's you, Cute, giving me these horrible nightmares, isn't it? And she nearly nodded, yes, just by smirking and squinting her eyes at me. I was paralyzed with fear. My cat is evil! She put her paw on my face. No, it can't be you. Or could it?  But whatever, the point is, Is it normal to have nightmares at the age of 23?

      So I woke up today to find that I'd smoked my last cigarette the night before. Knowing I could not enjoy my morning coffee without a smoke, I headed out to the corner store to buy a new pack. All my clothes were still in the dryer so I threw on an old pair of pants that hung down around my hips, much much lower than I'd want them to sit. Ah, who cares, drunkbridesmaid? You're only going to the corner store, it's not like you're gonna be sitting down in front of anybody or bending over in a crowd or anything. Reassured, I headed out.  The guy at the smoke store made his usual unfunny quip, "I'll need to see your I.D. and I'll need to get your phone number". Ha, ha, I always reply, more out of pity than politeness.  On my way home, I passed the Second Cup and considered treating myself to a latte. I paused at the door though, rememberring how awkward I find the two or so minutes of space between ordering and receving my latte; I'm never sure what to do with myself..do I watch them make it? Stare at the item and price list above my head? Pretend to be absorbed in their merchandise to my right? Oh, get over this, drunkbridesmaid, I told myself as I took a deep breathe and entered the store.  I recognized the guy at the counter and immediately cursed my decision--Elgin retail/service joker #2, only this guy's jokes are so awful, I've even seen his own co-workers roll their eyes at each other. I managed to quiver in a non-little-girl voice, "One skim vanilla bean latte, please". He hollered out to the woman working beside him as if they were in a battle field, and my latte the code word for we're out of ammunition, "ONE SKIM VANILLA BEAN!" Then he stood there staring at me and smiling; I stared and smiled back. I could see the weak brain cells dully swimming about in his head, treading water in circles, trying to form something funny to say. "Ok, that'll be twelve hundred dollars, please." Ha, ha, I returned. As I handed him a twenty, I knocked my un-zipped purse over. My heart stopped as I heard it--and the twenty dollars worth of dimes and nickles--go crashing on the floor. This can't be happening. A few people clapped; one guy shouted out, "Oh man, that's gotta suck!" Ya think, retard? As I bent down to pick it over, I felt my pants edge further down my hips, now resting on my butt, exposing a good half of my underwear. I knew I shouldn't have fucking worn these pants! It took me what felt like a century to pick up all the coins. When I finally finished, I raised myself off the floor, hitched my pants up, and felt the blood rush from my face back to the rest of my body. I was suprised to find my vanilla bean latte waiting for me, all ready. Gee, as much as that sucked, it sure filled the awkward gap between ordering and receiving, I optimistically pointed out to myself. Face sweating, moist hands still trembling, I welcomed the cool breeze of outside and took a sip.. ahhhh---it was all worth it.

      Tonight I've been tempted to kill a six-pack and watch old home movies and cry and smoke my brains out and stare at a blank computer screen and you know how it goes. But I'm not going to do that.   I'm sick of feeling sorry for myself; despite some random and unfortunate circumstances/events, I can no longer blame God or anyone in my life for being unhappy. And I'm not unhappy; I'm really not. I think I'm a happy person, generally speaking. I think I'll tell my therapist that tomorrow.   I like my therapist. She laughs at my jokes. She raises an eyebrow and supresses a smirk in half-amusement/half-disaprooval when I tell her I'm prone to leaving 37 messages in one night on a one night stand's machine. What I like most about her is that she wants me to get in touch with the old drunkbridesmaid, the drunkbridesmaid who used to love performing, being on the spot, and being the centre of attention. She thinks it's instinctive and would proove benefial--even if I don't wind up in the entertainment industry.   I don't want to disapoint her tomorrow, but I will. Her face will sink when she learns that I drank every single fucking night since Friday; I only stopped obssesing over ___ long enough to obssess over a near-stranger (despite the pre-school connection); I didn't volunteer at the radio station as promised; I continued to use my "little girl voice" when talking to my boss--not to mention countless servers and retail workers in the past week; the list goes on and on.  In grade 4, my mom bought me some cheap Zellers shirt that read, "FOOL FOR LOVE". It was so comfy and it fit so well that I wore it nearly every day for months. In fact, I believe I was wearing it in my class photo of that year. The sad thing is, that's sort of when it started: my intense and enduring imaginings, my preoccupation with perception, acceptance, and reciprocation of affection/interest. But being a "fool for love" is not such a bad thing; it's being a "fool for you-don't-even-know-what-this-is-yet" that'll wreck you in the end.  Alright, where are those home movies?

      "Post-drunk-kiss etiquette is not my forte, so I'm just going to be blunt: I had a good time last night, particularly the time I spent talking to you. Maybe it was the booze, maybe it's the rush of spring, or maybe I'm just impulsive and idealistic, but I'd like to get to know you, provided the sentiment/intrigue is reciprocal."  Yay to booze for courage and erasure of consequences!

      First of all, an announcement: I am blogging for one purpose only and that is, therapy. I think it's healthy for me to express myself and because I'm too lazy to ever pick up a pen, this is the best medium. Don't know why I felt I had to announce that, but whatever.  This weekend. What a weekend.   I'm happy that after 23 years, I still manage to suprise myself--unfortunately, my suprise is often mingled with fear. If I had not spent the past 23 years with myself, I'd sometimes be inclined to take off running.  But this being an on-line journal, I won't get into any details.  I got together with some old elementary school friends last night. Suprisingly, I had close to one of the best nights out in years. By the end of the evening, I was holding hands with someone I've known since pre-school. I actually have a class photo from back in the day with the two of us at 5 years of age, posed a mere few feet away from each other. Isn't that cute? Wouldn't it be just picture-perfect if something came of it? I'm such an idealistic, irrational romantic that I don't even trust my own instincts anymore.  I checked my e-mail no less than 150 times today.   I hate "The Rules"; if there were no rules, we'd never give anyone the wrong idea. And if we never gave anyone the wrong idea, often enough, eventually we'd become de-sensitized to rejection.  A couple weeks ago, my friend suggested that relationships would fare better if everyone just stretched out getting to know one another so that it lasted the rest of their life and they'd never bore of each other because they still had so much more to learn and experience about one another. This was in reference to some movie--the name escapes me--in which two couples take a lifetime to get to know each other, a pretty stark contrast to the conventional couple's 3-month butterfly stage. But I disagree. I've always dreamed of doing in three days and nights what takes most couples 3 months. Get it all out while you can; you could die tomorrow! Dive right in head first and aim for the deep end. If you find someone attractive, or interesting, or just generally stimulating, why wait? Why postpone dialing their digits or returning their phone calls. Why pretend to be uninterested or indifferent when really, all you can think of 24/7 is getting to know that person, inside and out. Why do we do this to ourselves and to each other? What is the fucking point? The point is, I believe, that for some fucked up reason, we're always bound to want what we don't know wants us.  I was only suposed to drink on Saturday. But I drank Friday and Sunday too. The units are in bed; I'm thinking about stealing a few glasses of wine.   I am not an alcoholic; My life is just so boring that drinking speeds things up.  I hardly thought about ___ the entire weekend. And now that it's Sunday, can you believe I actually feel guilty for this? I should not feel guilty for this.  My Dad bought me flowers today. It would have been mine and ___'s 2-year anniversary.

      My first ever University paper was on the theme of mortality in Shakespeare's The Tempest. I spent about two weeks working on it, wanting it to be perfect. I consulted three dictionaries and two thesaurauses/thesaurai(sp?), I had three people proofread it, and I looked it over myself--even reading it aloud--no less than a thousand times. The only thing I wasn't sure of when I finally handed it in, was whether of not I'd correctly spelled the word, "in-authenticity". It glowed a squiggly red underline under the eye of my WordPerfect spell-check and when I referenced my dictionaries, the word just didn't show up. I figured it had something to do with the hyphen; it's hard to know right from wrong when spelling in- anything. When I finally got my paper back, all I could do was stare dumfounded at the tiny pencil scribble, C-. The comments were worse than the mark. Along the margins, the TA had written things like, "I have no idea what you're talking about here", and, "You are needlessly wordy". But the kicker was his scrawl right beside my beloved "in-authenticity": "NO SUCH WORD EXISTS!!!!!" He didn't even try hide his annoyance; he actually used caps and that many exclamation marks.  I tried so hard not to cry on the metro home. I stared at the speckled ground and counted the 70's-style diamond-shaped spots. It occured to me that University was not my thing; in fact, I decided I hated it and that I would drop out immediately after the end of the first semester, take off to Toronto and give acting a shot, become another rich, famous, degree-less, People's Most Beautiful People of the year for a good five years running before my liver explodes and I die a la Marilyn Monroe--still so sexy, they'll need bodyguards at my viewing to keep the fans from trying to fuck my corpse. As I walked from the metro station to my house, I let the tears fall. Who gives a fuck? It's just Verdun. I stopped in at the depaneur and bought myself two forties of Lucky Lager, force 8.  Towards the end of my first forty, my roomate was able to make me snicker about the whole thing. We took turns reading my paper aloud (comments included) and doing various, but always insulting, interpretations of my TA's voice.  "What's the turd's name, anyway?" I glanced at my title page, "Barry White". My roomate and I looked at each other and burst out laughing. We even rolled around on the floor, repeating his name over and over again, hollering it in a fit of giggles. "Like the singer!" But it somehow seemed odd to me. I checked the cyllabus and paused for a moment, before bursting out into laughter yet again. "No, his name is Barry Webster! Webster! But I must've not been paying attention when I wrote White, it just seemed to flow better!" We nearly pissed ourselves.  "No wonder he was so mad. No wonder his comments were so mean!" A month later, I was writing my second paper for the class, this time on the issue of gender in Othello. By this point, I'd learned to zoom through papers the night before, making sure just to quote quote quote and make the quotes fit in all nice and snuggly--that's the key to any A paper--screw big words and big ideas, just regurgitate and regurgitate in allignment with the MLA handbook. Come the title page, I paused at Barry Webster. I took a drag from my cigarette and considered it. "Hey", I called to my roomate, "gimme a word that starts with W".  "Weiner?" He shouted back at me from the bathroom where he was pissing with the door open. "Sounds good," and playfully typed it in, "Barry Weiner". A couple weeks later, I nervously snatched the paper from his desk and flipped to end, an "A-". Glorious! For the rest of the year, my roomate and I looked forward to any new and upcoming papers for this particular class. Over beer, we made lists of new words beginnign with W to make into his last name. Each time I got a paper back, it was with trembling hands, but always, nothing. He either didn't notice, didn't care, or maybe he found it as funny as we did.  "Wanker, Warts, Wokka wokka wokka"--yes, we actually used that last one. But the best, the all time best, was the final paper of the year for which I was sure to use the word, "in-authenticity" in my concluding paragraph. I wrote this last paper with a sort of sadness in my heart, my roomate standing over me, eagerly gripping the back of my chair in anticipation, our breathing growing faster and deeper with an uprising of one final chuckle as I nostaligically concluded, "Barry Wagina".

      Like "meh", only with more of a whine to it. Went walking off a nasty hangover this morning. Down along the canal, then back up through the Glebe. The advil kicked in but I've still got fuzz-brain, a feeling I used to enjoy. I had an acid flashback along the way, spotted faint shadows creeping along the pavement. Fuzz-brain is a lot like the come down from acid--disoriented, tired, but unable to sleep. I wish I'd never done it. Feelings arose in me that I'd never experienced before, and even though I haven't touched the shit in seven years, those feelings have stayed with me since.   My doctor is a young guy, looks no older than twenty-seven. Last time I saw him, he made me promise not to drink for the next two weeks. The other day when I was taking out the garbage, I saw him walking down my street, hand in hand with his girlfriend. We caught each other's eyes and quickly looked away. I just know he's gonna walk by again, but this time on one of those nights when I'm stumbling home from a bar, blotto to bits.  Heh. Like "meh", only with slightly more spirit.

      Turns out I had this blog on the wrong time zone. Trying to figure out what time zone I belonged in was made difficult by the fact that I don't know the difference between the pacific and atlantic ocean, much less which one I'm closest to.   But anyway, an old friend, now avoidance of mine, once told me, "I'd write much better zines if I weren't so afraid someone would come along and steal a particularily ingenius line that I'd written." For the longest time, I thought this was just an excuse for his being lazy or having no talent, possibly both. But now that I'm blogging, I do find myself censoring certain things that I'd like to save for publication. It's annoying, though, because I find it easier to write when I'm on-line (whether it's a blog or an e-mail to someone). Maybe this is because I feel more connected to someone/something and not so lonely and isolated as when staring at the blank Microsoft Word page.   Up until this post, I had checked my profile 8 times for the 7 words I'd written--and you thought you were self-absorbed!

      I broke all vos, save number 8 and 12. Oh well, it's a start.  So look dudes, I'm gonna be gone for a few weeks come Sunday, but I'll be back.   With tons to write about, I'm sure.  I'm beginning to worry less about this trip. My main concern now is getting there and back accident-free and break-down free. Breakdown as in both the car and my emotional stability.

      Your little cousin finally turns 19 so you go for a few drinks to celebrate and stick him with the bill.  I am very scared. But equally as excited. I fear they might attack me. And yet I know I will whoop their ass if they even try. I am a cool person. Even though I care what people think about me. There is only a handfull of people in the world who see this earth as a battlefield. Still I carry a sword as shield.  Today my therapist broke my heart. She told me that by the time I got back from _______, she would just be leaving for her 6 week vacation.  We laughed a lot this session. I did my voices. On my way out, she said, "maybe I'll see you on t.v."  Maybe..

      But I'd miss novels, alcohol, nicotine, swearing, and sex.  I had a bad Sunday night and I called the ex. I was sad about something else and thought that just like when we were dating, talking to him might make me feel better. But he didn't pick up the phone and so I got even sadder.  I am ok, though. I am at the stage where I'm beginning to see some benefits to us no longer dating.  I can also now see myself without him and I can see myself with someone other than him. Just as I can see him with sommone other than me--albeit probably not without laughing. Cuz I just know she's gonna either be beastly or brain-dead, with no fine balance.  I guess you could say, I've come to an acceptance. And yet I still feel sad. I feel sad because of the good times. I miss them.   The thing about loss is that it's always the things you take for granted that you wind up missing the most.   I popped myself some popcorn just now and I kept thinking about how we'd wait for them to go to bed, then we'd smoke, eat popcorn, jokingly arugue about whose turn it was to go get the popcorn out of the microwave.   I put it in. Yeah but I put it in and then took it out last time. You're more stoned than I am. They're not gonna wake up. But then I have to go grab the bowls, too. No you don't, just open the bag and we can eat it out of the bag. Then my hands get greasy. I mean open the bag so that it's like a sheet. Then the popcorn will spill everywhere. No it won't. If you go get it, I'll do it, and I promise it won't spill, okay? Fine.   We used to put the popcorn in for 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Now I pop it for 2 minutes..popcorn for the single woman.  He used to eat the kernels. I'd laugh at him and offer him my popcorn instead. But he always refused, saying, "No, I just like the kernels. They're good."  Maybe that's why I notice the little things (when I'm not drunk, that is). Like candy, small things are intended to be savoured.  Shitty analogy of the week, number 17.

      Maybe the fact that I only write in this thing when I've been drinking says something about my relationship with my blog. &nbsp; I read some cheesey compilation of "things to do before i die" list on someone else's blog, so here's my stance on the subject: &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Get into a fair fight--sober 2. Try opium and absinthe and all those other wacky drugs from a century other than ours (before the goths ruined them) 3. For one day of my life, just say whatever is on my mind--no holds barred. Just walk down Elgin and wham an observation comes to mind and&nbsp;so I utter it aloud&nbsp;(which might&nbsp;move #1). 4.  Whatever, I don't feel like making this list anymore. My head hurts.
