      My sister and I are as starkly different as we are very similar. We are envious of one another’s strengths, as they are juxtaposed qualities/talents. B. is very good in school and always has been. She applies herself rigorously and succeeds but I have never really been good academically. Often, (more often than not) I was conforming. In Grade 12 I had a Biology teacher who was inspiring. He had an engaging way of teaching and I sought his praise and approval. I did well in that class. Biology is fascinating to me and that fascination seems to run in the family. My father is a doctor, as was his father*.) I also did well in Music but that was it. In all other classes I was "coasting". I don’t apply myself. I am intensely passive/ aggressive and stubborn when forced to do things. I don’t learn well in mass-production learning situations. I don’t like to sit at desks and take notes on boring topics where the concept is just regurgitation on command.  The concept of learning in academic surroundings such as university is so attractive. All that knowledge! I am doomed to never succeed in that relm so I will have to learn independantly.&nbsp; I attended a university prep school - private and for that reason I feel like a failure for not&nbsp;obtaining that crucial piece of paper, if only to cram&nbsp;up my parents ass.&nbsp; God love 'em.&nbsp; I seek their approval too.&nbsp; How sad.  &nbsp;  *My father’s, fathers’ father was a biologist!

      ...I wrote about you:  Entitled "It's in the genes" In between frequent trips to the bathroom and selections of Henry Rollins' spoken word, I have attempted to begin an entry. I have a great desire to write but have little to say. I feel the need to create something. My sister is a great creator. She's like a little McGuyver, making crazy cool shit out of nothing....bringing together discarded wrappers, shards of CD's, twine, cardboard and other daily refuse to make something recognizable as having value and beauty. She envies me my ability to "do school"--to succeed academically. And I envy her need and ability to create. She has a vegetable garden. I have a few frail plants, and look forward to the days of my life when I might have a patch of grass and a few things growing in the ground.

       This summer’s softball season is almost over. My team has done so well this year. We’ve been doing well the whole time with been together – this version of the team. It’s a special mixture of personalities..all women. Unstoppable.   There's nothing hotter then women doing something they're good at.  I'm never been into competition.  This is my only real sports team experience.  I played net ball extremely briefly in elementary school. I play on other softball team, but it’s a non-competitive slowpitch team opposed to a semi-competitive fastpitch which I am more familiar with. They’re a group of men mostly. I feel a little alienated on that team. I’m keeping it up though because I love the game. It’s really the only sport I like to play.    July 27th - The season is over!Not exactly a spinetingling final tournie. It wasn't close.  Three losses to one win.  It was a fun time though.  The weather was scorching.  Almost to hot for baseball.

       Frustration levels at an all time high. Quitting smoking is not a task for the weak. I’ve been trying to quit for about four years. I’ve tried it all. The patch, gum, acupuncture, Zyban. Zyban is just bad news. The patch works the best of all methods but any trauma and it’s easy to run back to the cigs.  Eventually I will have to accept that it’s all about the power of the mind. I don’t want lung cancer. I don’t want to pay $8.50 + every two days. All I’m doing is putting money down on my next chest infection. I’ve come within an inch of pneumonia half a dozen times. Gotta remember that!

       BERLIN (Reuters) - A U.S. sportswear maker has designed shoes that expand to fit a child's growing feet and is trying them out on cost-conscious German shoppers, the company said Tuesday. The "Max, der Wurm" (Max the worm) shoe, first delivered to stores in Germany last week, has a flexible design with an extending concertina panel between the toe and heel. One push of a silver button and the panel can be lengthened to accommodate quickly growing feet and bring relief to frustrated parents who want to avoid buying their children countless pairs of new shoes. Bernadette Lingg, a spokeswoman for K2 Inc, an American sporting goods firm, said it was targeting Germany where shoppers' keen eye for a bargain has been sharpened by economic worries that prompt many to think twice before opening their wallets. "Our main focus is Germany. The German market for children's shoes is in a terrible state due to the number of imported models and aggressive prices," she said.      LONDON (Reuters) - British treasure hunters were warned on Tuesday to stay away from a colony of red squirrels after a best-selling newspaper reported the rare creatures' nature reserve may be hiding a $46,000 engagement ring. The diamond and platinum ring was thrown into the Formby Point nature reserve near Liverpool, northwest England, by the fiancee of 18-year old soccer star Wayne Rooney after a row, the Sun tabloid said. Rooney, who earns more than $90,000 a week, became a national hero after a sparkling performance while playing for England during the Euro 2004 soccer competition this summer in Portugal. The National Trust conservation group said the 300 squirrels would be disturbed if people started looking for the ring. "We are quite concerned about loads of people trampling around," National Trust spokeswoman Debbie Pears told Reuters. "We don't allow metal detectors on National Trust land and we are asking people to stay away so they do not disturb the squirrels."   SAN ANTONIO - A killer whale at SeaWorld repeatedly slammed its trainer underwater during a show that was captured on home video in dramatic footage aired this week. The trainer, Steve Aibel, was not injured in the Friday incident. The whale began slamming Aibel during the show, and other trainers rushed to the side of the tank. Aibel, who has trained the whale for 10 years, said he was surprised and is unsure what prompted the behavior. But he said the whale, named Ky, is near breeding age and may have just been feeling his adolescent hormones.  OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE IN BATHTUB ANYMORE. IT'S DIGUSTING WHAT WE AS HUMANS WILL SUBJECT ANIMALS TO JUST FOR OUR OWN AMUSEMENT.  SALT LAKE CITY - Two men planning to throw lighted fireworks from a car were burned when they forgot to roll down the window. "They lit a large mortar rocket firework" and were going to throw it out the window, Salt Lake County sheriff's Sgt. John Barker said. "The passenger threw it out the window, but he forgot to roll the window down. It bounced back in his lap." Adam Weber, 24, was in fair condition Thursday at the Intermountain Burn Unit at University Hospital with second and third degree burns on his arms, legs and torso. "He's going to be in a lot of pain. I don't think it's life-threatening, but he's going to have a hard time. It's going to be a long process to get him healed up," Barker said. The driver, Jared Williams, only had minor burns to his back. The accident happened about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday. The investigation has been turned over to the Unified Fire Authority. An officer told KSL-TV any charges filed likely would be just misdemeanors.  HOW STUPID CAN PEOPLE BE? IS THIS GUY A NOMINEE FOR THE DARWIN AWARDS OR WHAT?   BLACKSVILLE, W.Va. - Warning: smoking in the toilet can be dangerous. A portable toilet exploded Tuesday after a man who was inside it lit a cigarette. Emergency workers said the man was not severely injured and drove himself to Clay-Battelle Community Health Center. He was later transferred to Ruby Memorial Hospital. His name and condition were not available Wednesday. The explosion, which occurred in Blacksville, resulted from a buildup of methane gas inside the portable toilet. The methane did not "take too kindly" to the lit cigarette, said a spokeswoman for Monongalia Emergency Medical Services.   I'D SAY THE METHANE TOOK VERY KINDLY TO IT.

      The whole office is on alert as the highest ranking dude on site is due to arrive with some other big wig. I am wearing clunking ‘girl’ shoes as that is all I have to go with this outfit and damn are they uncomfortable. I’ve never been much for girl attire. I lack the delicacy required. So much of those fashions&nbsp;are uncomfortable and ridiculous. For example: The thong. Conceived of by men, worn by women. I shudder at the thought of having to wear one. I’d rather go commando.  &nbsp; Work: Work is slow. I have lots of time to amuse myself however I like (read the Economist, make list of must do’s, draw) and it’s quiet. I enjoy being an administrative assistant (glorified receptionist) much of the time. I really got into trouble when I began to have delusions of grandeur and wanted to move onto something with more responsibility. I ended up stuck in data entry. Locked away in a grey cubicle.  Now I’m back answering the phone, filling and shipping and I really need to go to school. It feels like if I stall much longer I will get stuck in this menial position forever. I probably will. There is really not far to go without education. It’s so important.

      PANIC!! I couldn't defer. It was terrifying.&nbsp; My dreams being torn before my eyes.&nbsp; Whatever they are.&nbsp; I am still undecided.&nbsp;I have no savings and the deadline was rapidly approaching.&nbsp; I believed (feared) I would be dropped from the program.&nbsp; Luckily my Dad saved me just in time.&nbsp; I look forward to paying him back.&nbsp; My first day of School is Sept 7th.  BCIT: I’m really looking forward to going to school and the latest… THE LATEST… I never received my acceptance package although I know that I was accepted as I can see that online. I contacted someone in admissions and I was told that my package was mailed three weeks ago!! The ironic thing is that my landlord (who lives upstairs) works for Canada Post so there is almost no excuse for my not having received it….It must have been lost in the mail.  So there’s another new, exciting acceptance package comin’ to me.  Th bad news is that apparently my tuition was due last Friday. They can’t really mean that. Perhaps they began accepting tuition last Friday. Like they wouldn’t have taken my money before if I wanted to give it to them – geez – all I know is that I don’t have it so I have to come up with something fast. Defer this payment to a later date.

        Shine a light into dark corners to reveal the misconceptions that are restricting your forward movement. Your first task is to create stronger boundaries and more clearly define your plans.           Forgiveness of another comes naturally; forgiveness of self takes a bit longer….      Interesting quote. It must have meant something to me at the time -- two, three years ago. The first part is still valid to me, however the last line there.. I'm not sure how naturally forgiveness actually does come. You hurt me and I just may harbour resentment for sometime. Sometimes, it is harder to let go of your anger and hostiliy than it is to keep on hating. Hate and anger can be very comforting defensive mechanisms. (Hey! There's a new one.)     I need to learn to clearly define everything. Maybe even rope off the things I can't clearly define into their own CLEARY DEFINED AREA. Yeah, that's it, yeeeea..       What was good for us at one stage of our lives may be     lethal now. We need to take stock and see where we are with our lives.                     - Sept 8. Meditations For Woman Who do Too Much

       Science VS. Art   I can do both.  Science to fuel art. Steady employment of  endless  facination    (how will I find that?)    where I make a lot of $$.    Yeah.      With heavy wealth capacity I can shove my (?art?) work out there whether   they   want it or not.. All the gooood artists do that.  Or die and are then  appreciated.  Whatev's.

        Reasons to quit smoking:  a) Cancer is permanent and invariably leads to death.  Cigarette smoking contributes DIRECTLY to CANCER, emphysema, shortness of breath, pneumonia, sickness, coughing, bad breath, exhaustion and depression.  I KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE.    b)I think I like smoking cigarettes but really I hate it the moment I inhale. It makes me feel like I have failed myself. I own my body. I have to protect it.  I HAVE THE WILL .  TRY HARDER. I CAN.      c) Remember when your lungs filled with guck and sticky horrible tasting pus and you couldn’t breathe?? Desperation, oh God, when I get well again, I’ll never smoke again…      d)Cigarette companies control my life and make $money$ (so much fucken money = 1 pack aver. $7 x 5 a week x 52 x nearly seven years = $12,360. OR 36,500 cigarettes, give or take) off this weakness.  EIGHT bucks now. (that’s $2,080 a year-- groady.) EIGHT bucks that could go towards art supplies, CD’s, food, books, a daily newspaper, a computer, school, travel, a more worthy cause then temporary brain lapse from carbon monoxide and a mediocre stimulant.    e)Everyone apparently should be able to run flat-out, from standing still, for two miles.  Can you?    f)Surviving an addiction is hard but not impossible.  You know this to be true.  Prove it again to yourself.    g)YOU ARE RESTRICTING THE FLOW OF THE PRANA, YOUR LIFE FORCE.            h)Don’t let the dark side of the mind get sneaky and upperhanded.  It will devise ways to get the chemicals: Lying, demanding, scraping, begging and stealing.  The tobacco companies have mad scientists to envision new ways to keep me addicted.     j)Embrace the withdrawal.  It’s not withdrawal in the sense of a loss.  It’s detox!  All I’m losing are the damaging poisons. Yippy! So they dig in their claws on the way out. So what?!?? Show ‘em who’s boss around here.    k)As you quit, you may have as much candy as you could possibly want.   Breathe freely.  This will be a new freedom.       NO SMOKING

      Man my head hurts.  I've been staring at a bright screen for so many hours today it's really starting to get to me.  My lungs hurt too.  I've been binge smoking out of stress.  No song for today.  Maybe "Trav'lin' light" Billie.  Maybe.  There was nothing that really stuck out.  I feel so on hold. I really need the   GOVERNMENT    OF    CANADA   (!) to MAKE CONTACT and tell me what the deal is re: my loan.  No word so far and I'm starting to get nervous.  I have been given two numbers.  One that is just a recording of a local number they would like me to call..and when I try that #... it is constantly busy.  Que faire?  It's alarming to me that I can't get a hold of the Ministry of Advanced Education if I want to.  They have the money.  I need it.  But quick.

       I t feels like I have been haunted by depression all my life. It sucks the motivation right out of me.    (How bout I just go lie down and die?!!?)    I have such a strong desire to do great things:   Education:A degree in Biochem or Computer Engineering, write a book. Run an art gallery. Continue, continue. I want to learn the piano just in time to have a recording career in late life. I want to teach children.   None of this will happen if I keep undermining myself with sloth. I can't be entirely blamed for this inclination to do harm to my self. I was taught and now I have to unlearn it. It's easy to give up. It's easy to believe you can't do it. It's much harder to convince yourself you can when all you want to do it give up.  First thing I should tackle is throwing out all my un-needed shit. I'm going to need an intervention.   ~Self Intervention~       ISN'T IS EXCITING to know that we do not have to live out our childhood messages?

Not so much a process of evaluating what is happening now and what may happen and how to get there and what one may find when one arrives. Lack of forward motion. I write to deal with her and to make sense of what happened with her, how it hurt me etc.  She writes about them.  Her mother. Same reasons.  It is a cycle. I knew that ten years ago. I will be in the process of breaking the vicious circle as it were if I don’t do these things that she does. The way she does. So I have to think about what she does and why she does.     If I am to go the difficult route, she and I could try to get to know one another to explore that common ground.      AND HOW PAINFUL AND FUCKED UP WILL THAT BE??!??

      Re: Friday night’s drunken conversation  XXXXXX, I had a big, long, hard think about what was said and inkeeping with our No Game Playing Initiative I should brief you on my conclusions:  1) I don’t do “fun” things. That is to say I am not very good at them. I have been envolved with a few and I have a heart-mind-soul configuration that is not well suited. I am more an intimate connection type of person. 2) The “fun” things I have attempted have invariably ended in extremely UNFUN ways. Generally, one person is having fun and the other is getting emotional and falling. I have been on both sides of the equation and I already know how the thing between us is going to go. Which leads me to my next point: 3) Even before things got physical, I had an inkling that with more time getting to know you and more and more FUN ACTION I would probably adore you. Therefore: 4) No more “fun” thing. It’s just practical. I don’t want nastiness and neither do you. I go to school soon, you may make a break for it and go to Schumbergler, or whatever it’s called. And then I don’t have to hate you forever. That’s all. This blows but I don’t want to become a witch. Cuddles and farts, Arbutus

        16 days left.  I am seriously not into looking for a new place to live.  There is not a lot in my range.  I'm looking for 550-700.  700 is still a lot more than I want to pay.  I'm poor. Poor but relative happy today -aug 14th-  I have the week after next I guess.  Gotta get on it before the dastardly students scoop up all the prime opportunities.          I looked at appartments. That is to say: I looked in the paper, called some places, but after checking out where they were, I never went to the appointments. They were the same cracktown buildings I looked at last time I had to move. At least I got them out of the way.    For a person like me, it's a drag looking for apartment. I don't like having to make calls, take and make appointments with strangers, all of over the city. From the tones of some of the people I talked to today, I can safely say I am not the only one.   On Sunday, my landlady (I have two landlord peoples, a lady and a man) came down to tell me I have to move - my world is turned up side down. I have school in a very short while and the last thing I need is a change of venue. I love paying cheap rent. I love my apartment. But now I have to move. I have 60 days. I can do this. I am scared. It's a big thing to have to pack up your shit with 4 weeks to go til the ultimate crunch down   (school!)    I can do this.   What's more is I completed my student loan application on this quotient of rent. Now I have to reassess with the government and  just  getting them on the phone is a  monumental  task.

       urlLink   once upon a time.. When I had a garden. I did all I could. It's a lot of work. Constant work. believe it or not, not all plants get along. For example, onions (leaks) and potatoes. No go. The onions will kill the potatoes.  (I had a lot of baseball and abandoned the garden both years I took a run at it.)  It was wonderful.   urlLink
