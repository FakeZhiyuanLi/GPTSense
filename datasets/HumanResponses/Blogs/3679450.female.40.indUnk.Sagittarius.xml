       Ohhhhhh Goddd !!it's of some concern to me when a customer wants to CONFESS ALL.Why please? why me ? I may not wear a ring,I am not married on paper but in the real world I have husband and child. I do not need your angst matey..what would make a person relate the potted history of their last 5 years to a total stranger? I'm an unpaid psychiatrist.Tomorrow his burger is going up a quid.

       I really did'nt think it was gonna work but I'm so glad it did.I was cringing in my smug security that THIS WAS A DREADFULL IDEA..patronisingly offering my help cos I have a big car to carry kids and Tesco value sandwiches in...I hate myself ..Kids parties are venued around here with  other people to supply the food and happy cleaneruppers! But if you're  skint and single re-think the options.It was BRILLIANT..The parents that stayed loved it,the kids adored a class outing , open air picnic and The Park all in one go and it cost Â£20 on food.Bloody Brilliant!  My face tho is not a happy one..Tesco face wash I'm beginning to think is not meant for the face but washing the dog..soddin Tesco Value.

       I surfed from this : Yahoo! 100 Sites for Women  urlLink Yahoo! 100 Sites for Women   to this   urlLink The Vagina Monologues  to this  urlLink V-Day UK: Until the Violence Stops   I ended up crying though I've no idea why apart from the wine I've drunk.I've never known any real violence from a man personaly but I can empathise as a woman I suppose?

               Soooo new house is meaning new start and NO infidelity which I'm actually finding quite easy at the mo.I LOVE this new place an I owe His Lordship loads an loads 'cos I really gave him some grief in the weeks before we moved...and as per he was right and I could'nt see any further than the end of my nose ..blah blah  What irony!! His L has just got back from the pub and told me he feels depressed,hates it here and wishes he was still at the old house ..SHIT!!

      Had a bust up with a neighbour on Friday morning.The unfortunate woman came to get in her car 2 mins after I realised I could'nt get mine out..not good at 8am when I've got a hangover...we were like a pair of fishwives shouting in the street !! oh dear oh dear still she has'nt parked there again over the weekend!  So last night I drunkenly decide I will make an effort and text L to see how he is and with an inspired request for his email..why I've not thought of this before I don't know.(prob cos they were always spying into each others email at his last workplace!Don't think any of my customers recognised my arse out of it's jeans casing tho!)I then promptly turned off my mobile and rightly so cos he must have got straight back with a reply on my voicemail..his Hotmail addy doubly recited to make sure I have it correctly!So my favourite form of communication may manage to rekindle something..only time will tell....

      I have upset him I think..the other half..and I should know better.It even mentioned this on the radio the other day.BUT I CAN'T STAND THE SMELL OF FAGS ANYMORE...so you don't nag about it cos it makes them more determined to NOT give up the radio says.Now I entirely understand this being a smoker for 26 years myself..so how come I can do it?
