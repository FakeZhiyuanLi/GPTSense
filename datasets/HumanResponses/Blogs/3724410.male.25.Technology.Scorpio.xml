       Is that true ?    urlLink What is spirituality ?  About me, I say that spirituality is just be yourself, listen to your inner voice and do whatever you wish but yes, do take care of the people around you, do think once about them, think of your family, its values and its respect .. and Believe in Karma..  If u read Bhagvad-Gita, it explains clearly ,   urlLink   yatra yogesvarah krsno  yatra partho dhanur-dharah  tatra srir vijayo bhutir  dhruva nitir matir mama    lots of wars and crimes happening in the world..yeah..its a matter of disappointment but don't lose your faith in God. when i talk about God, i am not talking about Lord Krishna or Allah or Jesus Christ, I am just talking about that angel who is sitting up there and watching us .. i am talking about that supreme personality of Godhead who takes care of the things which are not under human control.. I know many of you guys don't beleive in the existence of God... so i am not advocating His existence or non-existence..I am advocating spirituality by means of "Casting pearls without expecting even a single pork-chop in return."

       Dhananjay's punishment got a Stay order  .  urlLink Mr. President is considering his mercy plea   But Why ?  A guy rapes and murders a 14 year old girl and our judicial system takes years to reach a final decision for such a henious crime and Mr. President jumps in between to put a stay on it. Dhananjay is supposed to be hanged till death and why not ?  Think of the girl who died .. Think of the parents of the girl who are facing the trauma since this incident has happened... Think of the cold - blooded murderer...and then eventually, you would also agree with the  court's decision.. Human right activists are crying over dhananjay's rights to live that he has already served so many years in prison during the trial ? but these fuckin' asshole activists are the people who'll arrive in AC cars, drink coke, make a lot of noise in public and go back in the same AC cars to attend a party in the evening.  why didn't these activists think about the rights to live of that girl , Hetal Parekh.? These activists are a bunch of some high class socialite ladies who have nothing to do btu want to be in news. So sometimes, they think of shifting their pictures from page 3 to page 1. that's all .. nothing much they need from dhananjay's case..   Dhananjay just deserves to be   HANGED TILL DEATH

      A guy &amp; girl meet , cupid strikes , then they go around, fall in love , decide to marry, villain parents ..look likes a typical bollywood flick..Right ? yes, but it has a twist . Unlike other bollywood flicks, this story doesn't have "and they lived happily ever after..." as they break off in the end and for a change, this is real life..   It all started when the guy meets the girl in a bank where he just got smitten by her attitude..the way she interacted, the way she convinced him. He invited her for a coffee...she came, they sat together..as usual the guy started in a flirting mode trying to impress her so that he can have few good moments..but he never knew..how far it will go ?   They clicked..went out for dinner one night..then other night..then every other time whenever they got a chance...the girl used to like the guy's attitude , his way of living, the independence he gave to her..and never questioned her individuality..and the guy liked the lifestyle of the girl , totally funloving character..the way he wanted his partner to be..   things were fine..soon they found themselves in love with each other..then those three golden words got exchanged...   finally, they talked about marriage..guy was a bit reluctant though as he thought his parents may not like the idea but the girl was insistent on that...she pestered the guy to ask for permission from his parents...and she agreed to ask her parents which she said that they would never refuse...then guy asked his parents..they agreed readily...the girl asked her parents..they refused..  her dad asked her to leave home if she wanted to marry that guy...   The time for decision came...they decided to break - off ..the girl asked the guy to forget her..the guy said that he could not do so but she didn't agree.. the guy said when he could leave everything for her..why can't she ? but she replied that she could not bear the hardships in life..so let's part the ways..   and they soon will be seperate..on their own paths.. the guy will soon go back to his place and the girl will get married to some same caste guy who'll be rich and highly settled may be abroad..   anyway..it ends with...   dil diya pyar ki had thi,  jaan di aitbaar ki had thi,  mar gaye hum khuli rahi aankhen,  yeh mere intezzar ki had thi.

      "We'r broken off...", he said.  "I was feeling for the past few days seeing your behavior..but thought so after you made a comment last night...but what happened exactly??", I asked.  "yeah , we&nbsp;were not getting along&nbsp;very well, some problems between us .."  "Hmm.... so had a&nbsp;fight ?"  "No..No.. We broke off on a mutual understanding...Actually, there were some attitude problems ..she didn't like some habits of mine and i didn't like somethings about her."  "yaar...choti choti baatein to hoti rehti hain.. but you loved her so much..how can both of you ??"  "She is a fun-loving outgoing girl..likes to go to discs and all.. and I , simply, hate it. For few days , i compromised..she doesn't like my folks&nbsp;coz' we are from diffrent culture but I never told her so ...  why should I compromise every time?? "  &nbsp;  Yes, this is the question all of us face in real life. Do you remember, when you were going around with a person , you did compromise.. but then after some time, you didn't ? why ?  When you start out in love, you ignore things , may be , which you are not able to ignore later in life.. things do hurt you but you simply don't give a damn to them.. those things later on, become a sore and hurts your ego..   Why should I compromise ?&nbsp; this question draws the line between self-esteem and Ego. Self-Esteem is must but why ego ? ego never makes your love and dreams come true.. have your self-esteem . Never let your partner play with your self-esteem but please don't spoil a relationship with your false ego..  Both the persons in a relation need to make adjustments, compromises...understand the need of each other .but thats what doesn't happen ... Everyone of us, riding on false ego, never thinks about other's feelings and what next , the relation for which we saw the dreams goes away..

       A TOI Article     Dharma and religion are not the same thing. The terms are used interchangeably for want of an appropriate English word. The Oxford Dictionary defines religion as "A system of faith, especially personal God entitled to obedience".   Performing rituals alone is not dharma .  Worship or upasana is the method . The mind gets purified by worshipping the Supreme Lord, Bhagwan. It will yield love for the Lord and all living beings. There will be no violence. Therefore, love for the Supreme Lord is the best dharma .    The word ' dharma ' means 'nature' . Whatever your nature, that is your actual dharma . Dharma is of two types: Naimittik dharma (temporary nature) and Nitya dharma (eternal nature). For example, water is liquid by nature. When cold, it takes the form of ice, and upon heating, it again converts to water. The cold caused the water to become ice, so ice is the naimittik dharma and liquidity is the nitya dharma .   Who is a living being by nature? The body is normally understood to be the person. We use the following terms â€” my body, my mind, my intelligence, etc. Nobody says 'I am body, I am mind'. So the speaker 'I' is not body but something different from body.   Until the body has consciousness or atma, it is identified as a person and not a body. Until the soul, the energy of the eternally existing, blissful, knowledgeable Bhagwan remain in the body; it is identified as a person. By the existence of that principle, 'I' remains and by the absence of that principle, 'I' does not remain; that is my nature (means, I am a soul). Soul is eternal, body is not eternal. Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita says that living creatures are part of His energy.   He also says that they are His own parts. On the basis of the second statement, some say that as the living being is a part of Bhagwan, the living being is also Bhagwan. This is not correct. Krishna says, "O Arjuna! There is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises of Living entities."  According to the Gita, living entities are not part of Bhagwan, but part of His energy. Every part of infinite is infinite. For example, sunlight cannot be termed as the Sun. Similarly, living being (soul) is part of Lord's energy, not of Lord.   The absolute is always absolute; so the Lord is eternal. Jiva is also eternal; so is their relationship and dharma . This is eternal dharma or Sanatana Dharma . The meaning of Sanatana is, whatever existed in past, exists and will continue to exist.   However, the dharma of the body is not eternal as the body is mortal. The subtle body made up of mind, intelligence and ego is also not eternal. When one's tendency for sensual enjoyment ends, his subtle body also ends. Therefore, the dharma of a mortal cannot be Sanatana Dharma. Sanatana Dharma is universal for it is the natural dharma of the living entity.

      i logged on to blogger today to give out a new post. Again, some discussion about crime and politics in India as i was reading into news websites..but suddenly, don't know why, but started missing my parents.. Right now, i am sitting in my office.. not much of work.. 5.30 in the evening..thinking of pushing ahead of time ..but don't know why i am feeling to go home..feeling that i should leave my job and go back to my home in chandigarh.  my bro' has also shifted to gurgaon as he joined a company there so, my mom & dad are alone back at home.. was this the time for which they educated us , gave us everything , that one day we'd leave them and go on our career path leaving them behind...that when it is the time for them to rest and enjoy the ripe fruits of their hardwork they'd put in for us.. they are alone..  even on the phone, my mom asked me"Beta, it has been 10 months since you have been here , why don't you come for a week? we wish to see you". my dad said to me, " don't worry beta, we are fine here, concentrate on your work. we are always here for you?"  my dad saw a lot of hardships to raise us, he killed his ambitions and dreams so that we can stand on our feet. my mom sacrificed her career so that she can take care of us. and what we gave them ? loneliness...  Mom, Dad ..I Love you ..I Miss you too much..Don't worry ...I'm coming home next month..

      Hain aur bhi duniya mein Sukh-anwar bahut achhe Kehte hain ke 'Ghalib' ka hai Andaz-e-bayan aur..  Can't describe or write about Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib .

       urlLink  na jayate mriyate va kadacin  nayam bhutva bhavita va na bhuyah  ajo nityah sasvato 'yam purano  na hanyate hanyamane sarire    " For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain. "  Anything which has birth has death . The first and foremost rule set by Him. But the soul never takes a birth or dies. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval--that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being.The soul is part and parcel of Him.   There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal.    Why we try to control the world ?   As, we all are disengaged part and parcel of Him, we have all the qualtities of Him. As He is the supreme controller,we also try to control the world. There is a conscious in us. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge--past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. Because of this forgetfulness, we do all sorts of things in order to rule. So, He made a system of Karma, that one has to pay here in this world for one's deeds. A killer has to be killed. If we remember that we are not the rulers then the problem of violence faced by this world will not be there.  He has created this world, so He has all the rights to own it, rule it, not us.  If we try to conquer and upset the nature's balance which he has created, only we'll suffer.  He doesn't play, He gave us a perfect place to live but its us, who spoil this nature and kill ouselves. He tries to guide us but if we don't listen, we pay for it.

      Have you  heard about Daya Nayak.. Yes, he is that famous Encounter specialist. The cop who used to count his encounters and boast of them.  If you didn't get the theme of my today's blog then try to remember the latest encounter flick  "Ab tak Chappan" starring Nana Patekar , playing the role of Daya Nayak.  But how good they are ?  are they real or fake?  is it right or police just kills to prove their worth ? whether encounters should happen or not ? what about common people getting hurt at times in the process ?  1001 questions and no answers...  Till now , debates go on.. encounters happen...   urlLink   People like Daya Nayak did some commendable job    and Human right Activists are up on their arms again against these policemen.   The terrorists who attacked akshardham temple in gujarat killing so many people were supposed to be encountered. What do you think, they will surender and say "Please come and arrest us.." Bull shit...they simply open fire.. and why should not we retaliate ? Yes these terrorist dont even think a single before planting a bomb in a shopping mall to kill so many innocent people..and these human rights guys want to save the rights to live of those terrorists. .  Remember Ansal Plaza Shootout..   Yeah..go and arrest them , what will happen ?  the case will go to court and they will be in jail.. some day their gang guys will kidnap some bigshot and hold to ransom the life of so many innocent people who , in no way, are linked to this everything..and finally these terrorists will be released  ..Remember Kandahar..  So many incidents.. and people blame encounters.. Yes..police is also human.so chances of human errors are also there .. but the same happen on war front also..  And so the debate rages on. While we settle back into our comfortable existences. Maybe once in a while, we nod at Jack Nicholsonâ€™s words in A Few Good Men: â€˜â€˜My existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You donâ€™t want the truth. Because deep down, in places you donâ€™t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it.â€™â€™ And we keep turning away from those pictures of bullet-riddled corpses. Till thereâ€™s another case of a mistaken killing. And a little voice whispers in our ears, â€˜There, but for the grace of God, go I.â€™   what da ya say ?

        Translation and History found over the Internet            Vande Mataram! Vande Mataram!         Sujalam, suphalam, malayaja shitalam     Shasyashyamalam, Mataram!      Vande Mataram!      Shubhrajyothsna pulakitayaminim     Phullakusumita drumadala shobinim Suhasinim sumadhura bhashinim,     Sukhadam varadam, Mataram!      Vande Mataram! Vande Mataram!        Translation :      The following is an English translation provided by Sri Aurobindo :-   I bow to thee,    Mother,richly-watered, richly-fruited ,cool with the winds of the south,   dark with the crops of the harvests, The Mother!    Her nights rejoicing in the glory of the moonlight   Her lands clothed beautifully with her trees in flowering bloom   sweet of laughter, sweet of speech    The Mother, giver of boons, giver of bliss!         History :     Vande Mataram is the  national song  of  India . The song was composed by  Bankim Chandra Chatterjee  in a highly  Sanskritized  form of the  Bengali language . The song first appeared in his book  Anandamatha , published in  1882  amid fears of a ban by  British Raj , though the song itself was actually written six years prior in  1876 . "Vande Mataram" was the national cry for freedom from British oppression during the freedom movement. Large rallies, fermenting initially in  West Bengal , in the major metropolis of  Calcutta  (Kolkata), would work themselves up into a patriotic fever by shouting the slogan "Vande Mataram," or "Hail to the Mother(land)!" The British, fearful of the potential danger of an incited Indian populace, at one point banned the utterance of the motto in public forums and jailed many freedom fighters for disobeying the proscription. To this day, "Vande Mataram" is seen as a national  mantra  describing the love of patriots for the country of India. Though a major aspirant for being the  national anthem  of India, Vande Mataram was eventually overtaken by  Jana Gana Mana , which was ultimately chosen. The choice was slightly controversial, since the Vande Mataram was the one song that truly depicted the pre-independence national fervour. The song was rejected on the grounds that  Muslims  felt offended by its depiction of the nation as "Ma  Durga " â€” a  Hindu  goddess, thus equating the nation with the Hindu conception of  shakti , divine feminine dynamic force.     HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY
