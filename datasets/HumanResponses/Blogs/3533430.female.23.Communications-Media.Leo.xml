      Yes they bloody well are!!!  Nuts to them for ignoring DM, despite being granted distribution rights. What kind of moronic company would turn down such a fantastic opportunity?  That's all I will say.

      Taking readers briefly away from my life as a webmaster to my life as an editor, I just really feel the need to vent about my frustrations with Apple.  A problem arose at work where a video I needed to edit had it's audio drift out of sync with the video, and after half a day is wasted referring to manuals and (identical) help files in an attempt to solve the problem with no avail, I ended up deciding to call Apple themselves for help.  Stop right there. Help? Apple? Not a cat's chance in hell, baby. Barely a few words into the phone conversation with the operator, he demanded a "$49 consultation fee".  Wait a minute, My company just paid a friggin' arm and a leg for their rediculously overpriced hardware and software. What makes them think they're gonna get another cent from me? Screw them! I am not prepared to allow them to waste company time and money! If they want to rip customers off with overpriced and inferior products and then slam a fee to help fix their problems, they deserve to rot in hell.

      Now here's something interesting happening in the DM community. People appear to be so hopeful to see DM rolling again they're coming up with their own rumours, and some are even going to such lengths as to create exquisite artworks and movies. Take for example the "movie" poster that's up for review on  urlLink The Danger Mouse Forum . Someone emailed it to me  a few months back with no heading words, descriptions or it's origin, but it's been proven that it's a fake but the artwork on it is fantastic. The time and effort gone into the detail of the stylised drawing is mind-blowing. The very same person also emailed me a couple of flash movies of Danger Mouse which are so damn good (complete with David Jason's voice) I'm almost convinced they were leaked straight out of Cosgrove-Hall's studios, but again no words of wisdom were there to inform me of the movies' origin. Coupled with the fact that this person had previously emailed me a fake poster, it's an old story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf - why should I believe they are genuine? What really bakes my noodle is why someone would go to so much trouble in order to create these fantastic pieces, but hide their name away and allow their credit to be mis-conceived as someone else's? Why don't they use this extraordinary talent to create a showreel, take them to Cosgrove-Hall, impress their bottoms off and then ask for a job? I would...   urlLink The Unofficial Danger Mouse Fan Club

      Oh, I forgot to mention a few miniscule details in my last heated up rant.  The US look like they're set to finally receive DM on dvd either late this year or next, thanks to a dealership between FM and A&E Home Video. It's a striking coincidence that this is occurring a short while after I started moaning on my front page about FM's inaction with the series, along with starting a petition to basically pull their thumbs out. Perhaps it is a genuine coincidence, or maybe someone of a higher (or lower) authority actually reads the site and takes notes. Hmmmm....  Here's to hoping that A&E are smart enough to release the entire series!  Cheers!

      Ok, little more than just a few minutes from my first entry I already have something to say.  I am sick to death of FremantleMedia playing Ignoramus on dangermouse. For those who don't know who Fremantle are, they hold the current rights to the series and are doing sod-all about it. Why? Go on...take a guess - why does any corporation refuse logic? It's all about the money. Obviously they don't realise (or care) that there is a huge fan-base behind the series. I tell you the truth, if I could shoot someone every time I hear a corporation use "money" as an excuse for their arrogance, this world's population would be halved very quickly. Not that I hate FremantleMedia (FM from now on), far from it, but I just wish that sometimes they would listen to consumer demands from time to time instead of conversing with their accountants (curse them all to hell - accountants cost me jobs on numerous occasions!) about economics and profitability. Entertainment Management is about managing entertainment - no rocket science there, so really FM should be more concerned about keeping us entertained, and in our case allowing us full access to the entire DangerMouse series, and not just a few scraps thrown on a badly mastered DVD every year or so. Accountants may complain that releasing the entire series is unprofitable, or they may not (but seriously, why else wouldn't they have done so already?). But I can assure you, there is more money to be made releasing every episode than leaving them to waste away in a box on a shelf in a warehouse somewhere. Come on Fremantle, Pull your thumbs out! If you can't make any money out of it, when why don't you just give it away then? It won't make any difference to you financially to you. After all, the rights to a series can only really be called an "asset" if it's making you money, which you are not allowing it to do.  OK, whinge over. I'm just annoyed that nothing is being done here. Maybe I don't understand economics enough, but all I know is that I'm one of the potential millions of consumers who have been denied legal access to their favourite TV series...because of money.

      Ok, Where does one start? This is my first attempt at blogging, so I'll probably be a little tight to begin with. For those who don't know me, my real name is Matt, alias Aquila, and I webmaster www.clubdm.com - which is a fan site for the classic TV series Danger Mouse. I guess most of this blog will be my rages, rants and whizzes about the happenings of this great cartoon, so those who love the series should hopefully be interested in what I have to say here. Be ye warned, however, I may end up saying some personal and irrelevant stuff too, so make sure you're well aware that this is a place I go to sit, relax, have a beer and hopefully refrain from swearing :)  Enjoy the show!
