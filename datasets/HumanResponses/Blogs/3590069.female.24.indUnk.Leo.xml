      So I finally went out to have some fun on Thursday to a place called Cafe Iguana...It has both a regular club music dance area and a salsa room.  I had a great time except for the expected nasty men who tried groping and sticking their hands up my skirt...I met one pretty nice guy who I might go out with that apparently used to play for the Atlanta Falcons...riiiight...we'll see if he's telling the truth.  He seems okay but a little desperate.  He comes on a little too strong sometimes which gives me the impression that he's desperate.  Maybe I'm too skeptical...maybe he's actually nice and he just says what he thinks and stuff.  He asked me to come down and see him tonight...pretty sure I'm not going to some guy's house who I don't even know when we haven't even been out on a date yet.  He said if I come down I won't want to leave...want to leave or won't be able to leave?  Misery anyone?  I'll keep you all updated on news there as it unfolds...  Not much else new...I'm hoping to go to the keys for the 4th but I'm not sure I can afford it just yet...  H'ok...off to the office to finish my paperwork for the night...

      Ever wonder what people say about you behind your back?  Ever wonder if people are really honest with you?  Not that I'm perfect by any means but I try not to say anything behind anyone's back that I wouldn't say to his or her face...I don't think most people share my philosophy.  Maybe I come off like a bitch being honest but I think it's better to be honest with people than to lie to their face, pretending to think some way when you don't, then turn around and talk shit about them because you weren't honest enough to tell them what you really thought in the first place.  What is funny (well, not really funny actually but you know what I mean), is when people don't know you at all and blow shit our their asses, talking about things they know nothing about...Guess I'm a little angry huh?  I guess I'm a little more tolerant of people than they are of me...sad...  Don't get me wrong, it can be really good to find out how other people see you and hear what they say behind your back since we don't usually see ourselves as having faults but, trust me, sometimes it turns out to be less educational and more hurtful than you'd expect.  Maybe I give off a different vibe than I think, or maybe some people just don't know who the fuck I am, nor have they taken the time to get to know me in the first place before judging me...It's very interesting to hear what they have to say or read it about it anyway...Funny how often we demand people be tolerant and not pass judgment on us when we are very judgmental and intolerant of them...

      I'm so happy it's Saturday!  I am soooo tired and my feet are so sore...Six days a week is so rough...Going to see Dodgeball tonight...that was the reward for making our office goal this week.  Should be funny...  I'm hoping to go to the beach tomorrow for the day but there are no definite plans.  Sleep is first on the agenda if all the church goers can be quite in the morning.  I guess I could get up and go since they always wake me up anyway but I feel it's important to stay in your pjs until 10 at least once a week.    Today was a pretty good day...I had four sales, the second time this week and only the second time I've gotten that many in a day.  I didn't, however, meet my personal goal for the week so I don't get my $20 bonus...that sucks but I'll definitely meet it next week 'cause I already have 7 going out next week...I serviced 6 this week, 15 last, and should service at least 15 next week...I set my goal at about 10 to 12 a week to be serviced 'cause I'm not consistent yet...At least I made $400 today...or I will have in the end...the job sucks but you can't complain about the money...  H'ok...off to the movies...

      H'ok so I'm really messing things up here...I couldn't manage to publish yesterday and then when I made a comment to CJ's blog, I accidently erased it somehow after I published it and couldn't make it post again...I'm apparently an idiot...Anyway, I didn't mean to erase it...this is what I had to contribute...  I CANNOT believe KFC...How white trash is that? Speaking of Nascar and white trash...I forgot to tell you all about this...We have certain incentives for selling some days and they are so funny sometimes. We have this thing called ecash where you can earn pretend money that you get to use to buy really cool merchandise like digital cameras and stuff...Anyway, one incentive to earn ecash one day was to sell to someone with a mullet...if you made the sale you somehow had to convey to the office, over the phone, that you were selling to a person with a mullet. If they figured out you were selling to a mullet, you got ecash. The trick was they had to know you were selling to a mullet and they had to confirm that over the phone with you. One way to let them know might be to say, "yeah, Nate, we have some business in the front of the house and a party in the back" maybe covering it up with ant problems or something...a party of ants or some serious business in the front. I so hoped I'd get that one...I almost sold a mullet once but it wasn't on that day. Another incentive we're supposed to have in the future is to make a sale using an accent through the whole thing, knock to finish, like pretending you're from Australia or something...I can't wait to try that. You gotta do something to make this job fun...Anyway, just thought I'd share that since you brought up Nascar and it reminded me of the mullet people...hahahahahaha...To use a familar phrase, I don't care who you are, that's funny...

      So I spent half an hour updating my blog for you all yesterday...too bad it didn't post...I was soooooo pissed!  All that great work for nothing and I'm not sure I can remember everything I said.  I don't know what happened when I went to publish it but it didn't show up afterward...lost in cyberspace I presume.   Anyway, we'll try this again...  Everyone has been asking me how Florida is, well, everyone except Miss Vaughn since she doesn't call, answer her phone or return calls...anyone know if she fell off a cliff or moved to Tahiti?  I haven't talked to her in over three weeks...Anyway, the money has gotten better 'cause I'm actually selling well now and it will start coming in slowly but the job still sucks!  I have sooo many f'ing bug bites it's not even funny!  I look like a leper!  My legs itch so bad and I can't stop scratching...I know, I know, if I don't scratch it won't itch but that's easier said than done (I should know since I have at least 25 bites on my legs alone)!  You'd think I'd be settled into the job now and content with selling pest control since that's my life now but I just can't quite get there...you'd think I'd be pumped when I sell well (today was my best selling day of the summer so far BTW) but really, I still find myself saying, great, I GET to do this all over again tomorrow...so fun!  I guess the experience is supposed to pretty much suck but the fact that I'm making great money should make it okay...I'll try not to complain too much but I'm sure you all can fell my pain just a little...I almost don't want to write in my blog 'cause I'm afraid everything I have to say is negative...There are good things about being down here...I just have to keep them in mind.  It is BEAUTIFUL for one, and it's nice to have sunshine all the time...     Enough of that, back to some bitching...I just started selling in Miami yesterday which is great 'cause I have new area to sell in but I'm pretty sure my Spanish sucks!  You'd never know I took a couple years in high school or a year in college.  I'm trying to learn some helpful phrases but all I really know that can help me for work is, "Are you the homeowner?" how to tell them I'm treating for bugs, how to say ants and spiders and how to tell them the price.  That's really only a couple words and then they talk and I'm lost.  I have no idea how to tell them they're getting a discount...I'm at a loss there and I can't carry on a conversation to sell them to save my life...Hopefully it will get better...I'll get by in the meantime and luckily I get several people who speak enough English to communicate.  It's funny how many people tell you they don't speak English, probably to get you off the door, and then start speaking English almost perfectly when you tell them what you're doing and that you're there because of the bugs...Bastard liars!  I guess that's one way to get rid of me...pretend to not speak English...ruuuude!!!  The people I work with, as I think I've told you all, are okay but I really need to meet people outside of work to hang out with...There is WAY too much drama!  There are a couple of really immature people that I can't handle but I get by for the most part.  This one girl I had to work with for the past week is so freaking crazy I can't handle it.  We all hate living with her and no one besides me has been able to work with her for more than 3 days.  I made it 7 or 8 before I told my boss he had to switch me or I'd kill her.  I seriously think she has schizophrenia or MPD...she goes from normal to psycho in 2.9 seconds sometimes.  One of the girls in the apartment finally let her have it this morning and yelled at her because she was so sick of her crap!  I love living alone at home.    I did meet a girl on the doors who is around my age last Saturday.  She's also here for the summer...her name is Lauren and she's really great...we went out last Saturday night....yeeeeaaaaahhhh...but I was so tired I could hardly enjoy myself.  I think we're going to go salsa dancing tomorrow if I can stay awake...these long days sure get to you sometimes.  I finally saw an attractive guy here...too bad he's married.  He was hot though...Hopefully that's only a preview of what Miami has to offer.  I gotta be able to have some fun while I'm down here, right?  Lauren knows a couple of guys and they invited us to a BBQ on an island in Miami last Saturday but I couldn't get off work early enough...oh well...maybe another time...maybe some of the guys will be good looking or at least have good looking friends.  Gotta have something to look at since the guys I work with are young and LDS...not a chance of any action there...    What else?  I don't have any fun plans for this weekend (well the one day off I get anyway).  Lauren is gonna be in NY visiting family but hopefully I'll get to spend some time at the beach...I really think we should get Mondays off also, at least once a month or every other week...it would be so nice to have a day for fun and a full day for rest...Half the time on Sunday I'm too tired to do anything fun.  I guess I'm here to work my butt off and make some money but I'd really like to take advantage of being in Florida.    Okay, I think that's enough rambling for tonight...I'll write more tomorrow if this damn thing posts this time...Hope you all are doing well...I miss you all a lot (a great deal, Emily, not a piece of land) and can't wait to see you again.

      H'ok so it's pouring down rain...not so fun when you're supposed to be knocking doors!  No big deal, it gives me time to check my email at the library and update the blog.  Thanks for commenting so soon; I appreciate the interest and input.  How many fucking uuuuus CJ?  Five...There's this new invention called a bookmark, however, if that's too many for you to type in the future...just kidding...  So about life here: I mentioned the mos...did I mention I haven't had a drink since I left?  In fact I haven't had a drink since I think some of us were at the Garden that last day of finals...wasn't that the last day?  It's all a blur now...All I know is there have been no drinks for me in over a month...that's not gonna work...I'm gonna have to make some normal friends soon...I have been offered a couple beers on the doors but I've declined for some reason...WHAT?  Turn down beer?  Yeah, I did.  Bad Tessa.    And on another note...what have I done since I've been here?  Not much but work six days a week, 10 hours a day but I did get to go to South Beach one Sunday...soooooo gorgeous!  I got to see Versace's home where he was killed on the front steps.  I didn't realize the house was literally right in town on the beach - interesting to see it in person after all the media hype.  South Beach is a topless beach (for a few anyway)...strange...I sat up to adjust my top for a minute and some guy walking by said, "You need to take that thing off girl, for real..."  Riiiiight!  For Real!   Oh yeah, then when we were driving back from Miami we saw two yellow ferraris that had wrecked on the opposite side of the bridge we were on...it totally looked like a Jay-Z video.  There was a Bentley stopped in front of them, a bunch of cops, the two smashed Ferraris and about 6 or 8 bottles of alcohol on top of one of the Ferraris...Crystal and Moet I'm sure...hahahaha...Not a fun vacation for those idiots.  I bet they rented those cars, got drunk and were racing when they smashed into the guard rail and each other...lucky they didn't drive off...  What else?  I got to go on an airboat tour of the Everglades with some white trash mullet men...Not many gators...the trailer parkers were pretty much the entertainment for the day!  That was good times...  H'ok so...I better get back to work...Can get rich hanging out in the library...

      Most of you who will read this know I got off to a rough start in Florida...car wreck in the first three days...strange Mos....lack of money in bank...no money being made nor prospect of being made in the future...Alas, the light has dawned and I'm finally pulling in some dough and things are turning around!  I was mooching off someone's wireless in my apartment building but that was nipped in the bud...RUUUUUUDE!!!  I'm at the library now taking a lunch break and starting a blog...this could be fun...

      It's been raining here nonstop for a few days...not so fun when you&nbsp;knock doors for a living.&nbsp; Sales suck right now and I'm sure part of that is due to the rain eating up many of the hours I could sell during but it's all coming&nbsp;to an end...18 work days left I believe...yeeeaaahhhh!!!!&nbsp; I can't wait to come home!&nbsp; I am so excited to get out of here....I'm actually just about to call to check on changing my flight.&nbsp; I get to leave a day early so I'm actually gonna change my flight to two days earlier and leave my last day of work if I can.&nbsp; It means I'll get in pretty late at home but I don't care as long as I'm home.&nbsp;   What else is new?&nbsp; I got my nails done today.&nbsp; I am probably more particular about them than anything else (possibly&nbsp;more than I am about my hair for those of you who know about that).&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the rain wasn't enough to kill my day, I have&nbsp;the&nbsp;WORST set of nails I've gotten in 8 years!&nbsp; Stupid bitch made me bleed several times too.&nbsp; They look soooooo bad but I ended up not having to pay, thank the Lord, since I have to practically redo them tonight.&nbsp; It looks like&nbsp;a 10 year old did them...I'm embarassed to look at my own hands....I don't think it would have been so bad if I could have communicated with the chick...again, don't I live in the United States?&nbsp; Apparently not....  I went to South Beach on Saturday night...I got two HUGE blisters on my pinky toes filled with blood that ruined any chance of wearing any shoes besides flip flops for three&nbsp;days but the night was not a loss because I did meet well, see/say hi to,&nbsp;Usher.&nbsp; It was crazy!&nbsp; I was with some friends outside a club and we were deciding if we wanted to go there or somewhere else.&nbsp; I had just been talking shit about Usher a few minutes prior, believe it or not, saying how I had a confession that I'd like to kill him for writing that Confessions song that is over-played 50 times a day.&nbsp; Out of nowhere I saw some flashing cameras and turned around to see Usher walking out of the club.&nbsp; Random!&nbsp; A chick I was with wanted to get a picture of him so we went to the car he was getting into...one of those new Chrysler's that look sorta like Bentley's....It was nice enough....He just kinda stood there I think 'cause he wasn't getting that much attention....I was surprised....then he just got in the driver's seat and&nbsp;sat there.&nbsp; We were only 5 feet away so I decided I'd just say hi, why not?&nbsp; We stepped up to the car and I touched it but, of course, out of nowhere some security dude...a midget security dude rather, popped up and said "you can't do that!"&nbsp; I was like, "Uh, okay....we were just saying hi, not like we were gonna maul the guy.&nbsp; He's just sitting there anyway."&nbsp; He was like, "yeah, but he's already in the car and we're about to leave."&nbsp; Please...he was just sitting there for like 10 minutes...with the window down...I'm sure just because he wasn't getting enough attention.&nbsp; Whatever...and there was some random ho in the front seat with him.&nbsp; Sure he just picked her up in the club and took her around the corner.&nbsp; Hahahahahaha.....  I guess it was some&nbsp;charity event at that club unbenknownst to me (although I'd heard something about N'Sync being in Miami that weekend) and N'Sync was there too....Most of them had already left, however.&nbsp; Some guy gave me and one of the girls I was with&nbsp;VIP passes to get into the club (you had to have tickets) so we went in to check it out.&nbsp; The club itself wasn't that cool but the outside was great...It was on the beach (not that you could see it at night but you could feel the air) and there were beds everywhere and TeePees....it was crazy.&nbsp; People just hanging out on beds and some other stuff I'm sure.&nbsp; I bet that place gets pretty scandalous!&nbsp; The blisters were worth it I guess 'cause how often can you say you got VIP tickets into club and saw/said hi to Usher in one night?&nbsp; It was kinda cool!&nbsp; I'm not really one to freak out about famous people but I really like Usher's music and I think he is an amazing dancer so I thought it was neat to see him.&nbsp; He looks exactly the same as he does on t.v. He either has&nbsp;really nice skin or they must&nbsp;put&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;makeup on him all the time.&nbsp;   I think we're gonna go up to Tampa this weekend to go to Busch Gardens.&nbsp; I'm excited 'cause I love rollercoasters...theme parks really, as long as they have good rides....and Busch Gardens is a Six Flags park and they always have good rides.&nbsp;   I think that's it for the night...I'm off to watch a movie and fix my hideous nails...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I tried to promise myself that I wouldn't bitch today but you all know me too well and after I read CJ's blog and felt her anger, I knew I was really pissed and was gonna have&nbsp;to get some things off my&nbsp;chest....err...huge boobs....  &nbsp;  First, CJ, I feel really bad for you because I know EXACTLY how you feel about the money situation...I severely feel that pain and I have yet to catch up on bills, let alone have any money for myself.&nbsp; I have bought five books ($5 a piece), a $5 jacket and a $8 shirt since I have been here...that is honestly it in over&nbsp;2 months....It sucks being poor.&nbsp; I borrowed the money from my mom for the hotel and scooter in&nbsp;Key West and have to pay her back VERY soon...nice mom, I love her!!!&nbsp; Anyway, like I said, I feel your pain with the money...Here comes my bad day and anger...  &nbsp;  H'ok so, as you all know, this has not been the most pleasant experience to say the least.&nbsp; I am so angry with the people here and the company.&nbsp; Everyone is so incredibly selfish and two-faced it's not even funny.&nbsp; Everyone is out only for themselves and it's rare to feel like I can trust anyone.&nbsp; I flew out here because I was told I only had three days to get here for the job and had three days to get home before school starts.&nbsp; I was under the impression that that was the only option I had if I wanted the job.&nbsp; I reluctantly agreed, thinking everyone would be in the same boat.&nbsp; Not so much.&nbsp; I came out here having been told&nbsp;there would be other people without cars and that everyone would be switched up with partners all the time to make sure no one had to drive all the time.&nbsp; Not the case...I usually get sent with one person for about a week and it feels like I am the biggest burden on everyone because I don't have a car.&nbsp; It's ridiculous to feel like I have to ask for a ride to the office in the morning meetings and to beg&nbsp;someone&nbsp;to take me to the store to buy groceries.&nbsp; People bitch about having to&nbsp;drive every day when they sell with me, saying&nbsp;it's not personal to me but it&nbsp;always feels personal.&nbsp; The car thing is so bad....I would never have come out here without a car if I knew it was going to be like this; not in a million years.&nbsp; I was assured&nbsp;it would be fine but it has been anything but fine.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Aside from the car thing and&nbsp;not&nbsp;feeling like&nbsp;I connect with anyone here as I have mentioned on numerous occassions, I am PISSED today&nbsp;to find out I can't go home early.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I was told I had three days to get here and three days to get back, the reason I didn't drive.&nbsp; However, I was told when I was recruited that if I worked hard and got burned out that I would be allowed to leave a little early so I accepted the three day thing.&nbsp; Apparently the going home early thing is not true.&nbsp; Come to find out, another girl who starts school the same day as I&nbsp;do gets to leave 10 days before me.&nbsp; WTF mate?&nbsp; Seriously, and she has no reason other than she wanted a break before she starts school.&nbsp; I talked to&nbsp;my boss&nbsp;about it and he said I had to talk to someone higher up than him to make the decision.&nbsp; Not only did this girl get to leave&nbsp;more than 3 days&nbsp;before school starts, so do many other people (two plus weeks in one case) AND two guys left for 4 days to go on a family&nbsp;vacation.&nbsp; How is&nbsp;it policy to say&nbsp;you only have 3 days on each&nbsp;end to get here and&nbsp;leave and that that policy is non-negotiable when it obviously&nbsp;isn't policy in the first place?&nbsp; So I called the higher up today and got some bullshit blow off.&nbsp; He told me that he didn't hire that girl I was talking about (even though he's in charge of all the hiring for my region) and he didn't know why&nbsp;she got to leave&nbsp;earlier than me and that if he let me leave early, he'd have to let everyone.&nbsp; BS!!! Obviously everyone else&nbsp;chose their end date and wouldn't need to leave early because they already were and I was given one as a&nbsp;condition of accepting the job.&nbsp; Also, he&nbsp;wouldn't have to change anyone's date if he's the boss....all he has to say is he changed my and NUNYA...he doesn't have to answer to anyone or say why he changed it.&nbsp; Can't he do whatever he wants if he's the boss?&nbsp; I was like, "it's funny how it's policy but it's not really policy for everyone."&nbsp; And, "why did two guys get to leave to go on vacation?&nbsp; None of the rest of us are allowed to take even a day off without paying rent and I can assure you they did not have to pay rent when they missed those days...why?&nbsp; Because their family is friends with my boss's and their mom said the only way they could come sell was if they could leave for a few days to go on a family vacation.&nbsp; So if my mom had called and said the only way I could have the job was to be able to leave a few days early to buy my books, do my reading and sleep, then would I have been able to negotiate my end date?&nbsp; Or maybe if I was a&nbsp;member of their church?&nbsp; I normally wouldn't pull that card because I think com,ments like that are usually illfounded&nbsp;and rude but&nbsp;I feel that has something to do with the way things are run here unfortunately.&nbsp; I only agreed to the rule because I thought everyone was subject to the rule.&nbsp; Fuck that!!!!&nbsp; To top it off, the guy told me that even if he wanted to change people's end dates, that mine wasn't even really a good enough reason to change my date...that other people had much better reasons than me.&nbsp; I guess I could have lied and made up a reason but I'm not like that.&nbsp; He said someone had a family member close to death and that they weren't leaving...I told him if one of my family members was sick I'd just quit.&nbsp; Isn't this company run by a family-oriented group of people?&nbsp; Obviously money is way more important than making sure your staff is happy.&nbsp; I told that guy that at this rate I had no intentions of coming back to this company in the future because I feel like I have been lied to from day one....many other things go into that but those are for another day....I told him I had wanted to come back next year but that the experience has been so negative because I was not given honest information.&nbsp; I could have brought my car and I could have taken more time to get here and home.&nbsp; I've surely lost money not having a car because my selling time, my bathroom breaks, and my lunch hours are all dictated by whoever is driving.&nbsp; That sucks!&nbsp; I could sell longer and earlier if I had my car and, in turn, make more money.&nbsp; The guy just tried to blow shit up my skirt and tell me that I'm a really strong person, much stronger and smarter than the average person as a law student, and that I will be just find working until the last minute.&nbsp; Bullshit but nice try!&nbsp; He said the only thing he was willing to do was maybe let me leave a day earlier if I changed my attitude because he didn't want me to go back home and talk negatively about the company.&nbsp; Fuck you and your fucking one day!!!&nbsp; What the fuck is one day gonna get me?&nbsp; It'll cost me $100 minimum to change my flight...not worth it for one day.&nbsp; Fuck this place.&nbsp; I'm so glad it's over in a month.&nbsp; If I could, I'd quit now and come home and sleep and get a job but, if I did, I'd lose all the rest of my commission and any money I haven't been paid yet for this pay period.&nbsp; The bulk of my money doesn't come 'til September so that's out of the question 'cause I'd essentially have worked for free if I quit before my end date.&nbsp; Fuck these people.&nbsp; I wouldn't bad mouth the company if they were honest and actually upheld their "policies" across the board to all people, friends, members of the church, etc.&nbsp; I'm so tired and stressed and I'm gonna come back that way if I don't get a couple days off to sleep and get treated with some common courtesy and honesty.&nbsp; I can't believe they won't give me an extra few days...Fuck 'em!  &nbsp;  Do you feel sorry for me yet?&nbsp;

      H'ok so I got soaked in a rain storm yesterday and woke up feeling like I'd been hit by a Mack Truck...Everything was cloudy and I couldn't talk for most of the day without sounding like a 75 year old woman who's smoked for 60 years....Didn't help that I stayed up most of the night on the phone....CB...I'm paying for that today but I'm not complaining 'cause it was great....Let's do it again sometime, K?    About 5 weeks left....Do you know how exciting that is?  I'm actually pumped to go back to law school; well, pumped to leave this job and see everyone again anyway.  I'm hoping to leave a little earlier than planned so I can rest and see people before school starts.  I'd like to go camping if at all possible...anyone interested?  I haven't really done anything fun or interesting lately to detail...I guess I went to a huge flea market in Fort Lauderdale that is open daily...It was interesting...Some neat stuff but also a LOT of junk...The outside market was like people with stuff off the back of their trucks...I'm sure some of it was hot and a lot of it was crap you couldn't sell at a garage sale...  I read The Stepford Wives and then went to see the movie...It was cute but not as good as I'd hoped.  The movie was much better than the book but I still think it could have been done better.    H'ok that has to be enough for today...I need to go to bed....

      The day wasn't going so well for sales but I pulled out two in the end and the pictures I had developed today didn't really turn out...that always sucks...but as I was about to post them for you all, my day just got better because one of my roommates walked in and told me she bought me some icecream to brighten my day...what a nice girl and you all know how I feel about icecream...It always makes the day better...  Here are some pics for you all to enjoy, some from home, some from here...

      I finally got two days off in a row...too bad they were the only two days off in a row I get all summer...This money better be worth it in the end 'cause I can't wait to come home...Only a month and a half left...yeeeeeaaaahhhhhh!!!!  H'ok so, for my two days off I went to Key West with some people I work with...Did I mention that I don't like the people I work with?  They are immature...self-centered...ruuuuude...immature...the guys deserve to be called immature twice because nothing else describes them.  Lisa and I were the only girls who went...You'd think it would be a girl's dream to go away with 7 guys and only one other girl but you'd be wrong in this situation.  They were so ridiculous and I was embarrassed to be with them half the time.  They don't think before they speak and if I heard one more remark about all the gay people down there I think I might have killed one of them.  I had certainly had enough when I was playing some music while driving home and they all started making remarks about my "lesbian" music...I coolly mentioned it was funny how they'd all been talking shit about gay people the whole time and how since they knew nothing about me they might want to keep that stuff to themselves because they didn't know who they were offending.  I hate when people make bold assertions and don't bother to care if they're offending people.  I definitely could have spent my only free two days with better company which would have made the "vacation" much better but I tried to be as positive as possible...I'm trying so hard here; it's more difficult than I ever expected.    I knew the trip was gonna be bad news from the start when we reserved a spot to go snorkeling Sunday at 1 and then left at 9 for a 4.5 hour drive.  No one would get out of bed and we missed our boat.  Luckily, the people were nice enough to let us go Monday morning at 9 but refused to let us go in the afternoon because they didn't want to risk us not showing up again, 'causing them to hold seats AGAIN for a popular time and trip.  Since we couldn't go snorkeling yesterday we checked into our hotels (I won't even get into that drama) and rented mopeds to drive around the island.  That was a ton of fun!  I was scared at first because I didn't want to crash but you get used to them right away.  I caught some sun and enjoyed touring Key West and the ability to weave in and our of crappy tourist traffic.  No one wanted to do anything I wanted to do of course so I spent a little time by myself (not that I minded), and then got ready to go watch the fireworks.  Not only was I late getting to Key West because of these idiots and missed my snorkeling trip, I missed the fireworks, or rather I had to watch them driving to the beach on my moped, because I agreed to wait for one of the guys who took FOREVER to get ready...worse than a woman...  No one goes out here of course so I pretty much went to bed a 12 so I could get up early and go snorkeling.  I was hoping to go Sunday so I could sleep in for once this morning but everyone ruined that for me and I had to get up at 7:30 to get to the boat on time.  Everyone, as expected, was taking their sweet time so I left without them and went down by myself so I would be sure to make the boat.  I made it of course and snorkeling was amazing...A bit intimidating at first but really fun...I saw a Man-O-Ray and a Nurse Shark...it was so cool!  I also saw tons of super bright fish...They looked like neon signs!  I'll try to get the pictures online for everyone to see.    The snorkeling and moped riding were by FAR the best parts of the trip.  The rest I could have done without, especially the drama of returning the mopeds.  A few people had to pay for damages and scratches to their mopeds.  They were pissed and threw embarrassing fits.  Hello, read the K you're signing...The guy went over all the existing damages and scratches and we all agreed to pay for any additional damage caused during our use; that's why he went over everything and marked all the damage down with us in the first place, telling each and everyone of us to check for damage so we wouldn't be charged.  They were all shocked when they had to pay.  Maybe it was expensive but they should have paid attention in the first place.    Man I feel like all I do is bitch when I write in my blog.  I gotta be more positive...oh wait, I am being positive!  The snorkeling and moped riding were really great though!  I had a good time despite the company and drama.  I think I'll have to rent a car and go by myself or with my friend Lauren some other weekend if I can.  I'd like to do some more stuff I didn't have time to do this weekend.

      Yeah, only five days left of work well, one or two really, maybe, since there's a hurricane coming.  Funny, it's called Hurricane Charley and there's one called Hurricane Bonnie up north that's caused a mandatory evacutation of Tampa.  It would have been even funnier if the one down here was Hurricane Clyde....hahaha...Anyway, yeah so I will be home in less than a week...I'm so excited!!!!  I don't think we'll be working tomorrow since it's supposed to be really rainy and windy from the hurricane, Saturday too.  Monday might actually be my last day 'cause I don't plan to work on Tuesday and Wednesday is my last day...I guess I could work then...Whatev...I'm kinda excited there's a hurricane...could be interesting...  I can't believe how fast the summer actually went, as bad as it was at times...it went pretty fast.  I can't believe we start school so soon!  Scary but good.   What esle?  I sold an NBA player's wife pest control today...I guess that was kinda cool.....Carlos Arroyo from the Utah Jazz if anyone follows basketball or likes him...I guess he's really good....I don't follow basketball so I wouldn't know anything about him but people in my office were really excited.   Just winding down the day and burning some people's cds before I head out of town so I guess I'll get back to that...Can't wait to see everyone....

      H'ok so I have 11 days left of work!  I am so excited!!!!  I managed to get my end date changed from the 19th to the 18th so I'm flying out late the 18th instead of the 20th just so I can get home earlier even though it won't be until 2:30 in the morning on Thursday...I can't leave soon enough and CJ has graciously agreed to either take my car to the airport for me or pick me up at that awful hour because she loves me.  Thank you so much CJ...you are the best!  I promise to repay you somehow for being so good to me.   We have a sales incentive this week that might land us tickets to a Marlins game on Saturday. ..could be fun!  On Tuesday we had a sales incentive for the day in which we could earn chances to bat in a wiffle ball (however you spell that) game....Depending on how you did, you could win a pretty hefty sum of money.  I randomly but luckily had my best day selling of the summer that day and beat everyone out for chances to bat...I earned 4 swings...no one else got more than one chance to bat and there were only three other people that even got to bat.  Take that!  I joked about striking out 'cause I'm not that great at baseball so my boss gave me a practice swing.  Too bad I'm apparently the Babe Ruth of wiffle ball 'cause it was a $10 hit.  We played in a parking lot and since I hit the ball all the way to the wall, I earned $10.  Alas, it was a practice swing.  I nailed the first real swing, not too hard with a plastic bat and a wiffle ball...and earned my first $10.  The second and fourth hits were fielders so I only got $5 for each.  After I'd hit the first two into the wall my boss said he didn't want to just give his money away and that if anyone caught the ball off the wall it'd be an out and I'd lose the $10 I earned.  Some schmuck caught the ball off the wall from my third swing and I lost that $10 but I  didn't care 'cause I came out one top with $20 earned and the satisfaction that I kicked everyone else's butts!  It was great!!!!  I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying what's left of their summers!  It's coming quickly to an end and I can't wait to catch up and exchange stories....  Take luck!  hahahaha I'll have to explain that to you all later.....
