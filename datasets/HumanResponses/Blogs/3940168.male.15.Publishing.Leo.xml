We played the dumbest final fantasy game there . . . crystal chronicles . . .its dumb . . . ow well when they were playing the game yugioh i was bored out of my mind so i played with his dog serious and we "rastled" on the poorch. Serious is a nice dog, he just got back from surgery and had his head shaved. Aparently had a tumor in his head. LOL my friend robby is so pathetic he just got back from science and math camp and now his entire rest of vacation is gone cus he has homework.

      Yeah when i had my friend hank spend the night we stayed up until like 4 in the mourning. Befor 10 we went to see the fireworks that were in hallowell. We watched them on the roof of the next building . . . The next morning we were rudely awoken at about 10 and that means we only had about 6 hours of sleep . . . omg that sucked . . . than we went to jimmy pond. At jimmy we kyaked and hank didnt like that too much and when he got i decided to also and went swiming, thats when i caught a turtle and named him jam. I had to let jam go after my dad was coming to shore. When i was in the shallow end i floated in and put my hand on the sand and to my surprise there was a shard of glass that slashed my hand and it was huge but i didnt need stitches . . . god damn it . . . From there we headed home . . . where we ate and hank made me play some game called hero clix . . . for a board game it was ok . . .  PEACE - Hopeless child

      I just finished watching . hack and i must say that would be real cool if they created a game like that cus it would be like . . . animeish and thats always cool . . . I have played the playstation 2 version of .hack and it sucked but maybe a computer version would be better . . . hmmm i dont know . . . The episodes of .hack last the 30 minutes but are all about 15 minutes long but u couldnt tell by the fast paced action . . . sometimes . . .  its a very unique anime that is well recomended to all ages except a dying man and a nweborn . . . =]  PEACE - Hopeless child

These drawings of mine slowly get better day by day and at this rate i might start drawing at college level soon enough and that would be great . . . i cant wait to get some computer software to start adding in color and stuff these drawings will look professional . . . YEAH!!!! . . . On joan of arcadia there is a cool looking goth guy that looks like a guy from that old nickeloden show called brothers garcia . . . dont ask . . .   Michelle ross a girl that I hang out with says she likes me and i said i do too but i dont want to hurt ANYONES feelings so i wont go out with anyone . . . plus i might hurt Danielles feelings if i do this cus i dont know where she stands on it cus we brooke up cus her dad . . . so i dont have an idea . . .

      Inside i think we are all bleeding and that blood is tears , the pain and suffering that has hurt us all in the past, which in turn gives us the energy to keep us going on. But most of us do not think about the past because the pain but, we dont realize that we must reflect or we will have a burden for the rest of our lives . . .

      The hottub is acting up and we need to get it fixed by a repair man . . . HA . . . I wish i could fix things  . . . I remeber when i was like 6 i took apart a lawnmower in about 20 minutes and it took about 8 hours to put back together. . . bad memorys . . .Yeah so moving on i had created some drawings and began to color them when i realized i did the colors all wrong. . . o well i am gonna try to make an online portfolio but, im not to sure how to . . . Then i began to try use the tracer box when the lightbulb blew . . . just bad luck i tell u . . . I am planning in on sending in some copies to a anime publisher and maybe an editor or to . . . I am hoping to get some idea of where my anime is right now . . . does it suck or does it rock . . . hmmm i dont have the slightest clue . . . so i need expert help. First ill need to find the adresses of some animators or editors so thats gonna be a dick . . . I slowly realized that i was looking in all the wrong places and realzed that i must refine my search to different places like the website tokyopop . . . or maybe i should find if i can get some information on the website animenation.com hmmmm well I have a flipbook of about 3 minutes which is about 24 frames per second X 180 seconds . . . which equals a hell of a lot . . . it took me about 4 weeks to create  and it doesnet even have color yet . . .Where to look , where to look . . .hmmm i mowed the lawn today and when my dad got home he was pissed that the lawn looked somewhat uneven . . . . mr.perfection . . . . Now I have been reseacrching colleges even more and i have found i could go to illinois for about 4 years then i would probally come home for 3 months and hed out to alaska and catch up with an old pal . . . from there i could catch a plane to Japan the home land of anime . . . hopefully i can speack japanese by then so i dont totally stick out like a sore thumb . . . ahahahhaa . . . they drive on the oppisite side of the rode . . . YEAH! . . . Then I would probally stay in a japan dorm while attending a college and learning the true anime form . . . finally from there i could return home and catch up with everyone and rent out a studio and start an anime . . . yep i have it all planned out . . . A regular anime show lasts about 20 minutes and usually runs about 26 episodes so that will take alot out of me . . . but if i make it that far i think i can do it . . . Finally i must end this chat with a little talk to anyone who cares "You only live once , dont waste it ... have fun!"

I was playing final fantasy 7 and i finally beat the final boss sepiroth . . . ahahahahahahaha hes dead now finally!!!! Cloud is my hero >_ ah well it was fun while it lasted . . .  hmmm i was just thinking in those movies where they say something like "where theres a will theres a way ..." where the hell do u see real life people say that !   i love anime but i mean i hate those dam card games . . . omg who the @#$% spends like 100 dollars on those stupid things ???? I was watching one of the coolest animes , its called Gungrave and its by the creators of trigun and i noticed too many similaritys and its fine but i mean thats sad when i pick up all the things alike . . .

      When this life is over i hope hell is optional because right now i have no idea which i would rather see or feel.  Heaven sounds nice but is it worth it? Is Hell all that bad?  Blood is what we are made of...hmmm thats true but i think feelings are what drives us. This life is like a torture that i guess only ends when u do then you are brought to an endless quiet...buried away only to rot and to return to the land as what you are and what you were.The funny thing is sometimes these feelings began to spread farther into me and i begin to think what the end could be like...a hellish death or the deep and entrunal quiet where you will rot...this is the thoughts that plauge me....deep inside me I am dieing just like you all are we all slowly die...  hmmmm well that is just some of my amazing thoughts . . . lol                                                  PEACE - Hopeless child

      Well i was looking through other peoples blogs and i found this on http://samurai_ko.blogspot.com/ and well i have to say that it sounds awsome . . . kinda sounds like me lol =]  You're Element is Night. You're a loner who is very creative but will never show your work to anyone. You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surrounds you and others can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriging and unorthidox but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like "Diamonds in the Rough" lol there is a kool pic but it wont paste . . .                                                   PEACE - Hopeless child

      Well my cousin was over yesterday and we watched a anime type movie which is called hentai,the worst type of anime out there cus its like anime porn. Yeah so we were watching this one called wordsworth (should not be viewed unless ur over 18 or just sick) and well the begging had a awsome quote " Strongest minds are often those whom the busy world hears last" now that was an awsome quote but some how they change from that to a horse man thing doing a chick . . . Oh as long as we are on cool quotes " When you do things right people won't think you did anything at all " Oh yeah that is a good one . . . lol . . .Right now i am listening to blink 182 and the songs just suck execpt like the first 3 . . . I got mail from my cousin in California today and to my surprise he was giving me hope.      Hey Sean , I hope when u recive this package its not to trashed , Well here i guess since u wish to be an animator then i might as well help you out. I guess you could use this art manikan and maybe some cash . . . i think there is about 20 bucks so if its missing maybe u got jipped :) well have a good year i might make it back for christmas but i dont know.

      Yeah i am barely awake but i had a weird dream that i was shot through the heart and i was a heartless person that was goth. I realized that I was going to die a heartless bastard like my fucking father . . . I realized that would be the consequence for not making it in the animation buisness. A cold hearted bastard . . . thats my fate . . . Great . . . Then im gonna try till i cant try any longer . . . I wont give up and be heartless ... I wont!!!!!! I woke up in a cold sweat and my stomach was churned in a knot . . . that was a weird ass dream . . . hmmm but i dont look bad in blk clothes though . . . =/ yeah well if i wear blk that doesnt mean i am gothic does it???? o well im not gothic so anyone that says so can go fuck themselves....

      Okay now my head is cleared and i am gonna write some stuff that is going on right now...    Lets see here i just purchased a tracer box that will get me started in animation so i can produce some short cartoons and send them to some editors to maybe be published or something . . .    I burped today while eating and my father went crazy on me cus i opened my mouth to burp and he told me to say exscuse me and well i dont talk while my mouth is open and he flipped out cus i didnt. Man then when i raised my voice he threatened to beat my head in. Yeah he pisses me off sometime but when i think about it i raise my voice alot . . . thats one of my flaws . . .   Not that i have no life or anything but i was researching some future college choices and there are some close in illionois ... and georgia. Then there always is Japan. . . the place that has kept my interest for many many years. I want to be taught there like most animators.

      I am a young kid . . . i might never amount to nothing but that wont stop me from trying. I wish to be an animator , something that seems so hard i will acomplish if i can. But, if i fail then all these hopes scribbles ambitions i have will fall with me into a vast nothingness. Yeah i am young thats what i keep saying when i fall into sleep . . . well im not and its about time i stop scribling and really fucking try to create something worth making . . . so i have started invested in animating materials and sorts. I just wish that time would slow down cus . . . i have 4 years of regular school ahead of me befor i have to go through college and i am damned if i dont make it that far . . .   So hear i sit on the computer sorrounded by many drawings and other shit that clutters here. I slouch sitting here in a mess. I have a "great" imagination many people say . . . but when it comes to actually creating something in anime form my brain just dies. A young kid i am . . . thats life will change dramatically in the next four years. Scribbles that could make or break me . . . i have never had good luck . . . what will the consequences be of failing in this anime career , i mean if i fail it will be four fucking years down the drain . . . well life will change this little boy for better or worse . . .
