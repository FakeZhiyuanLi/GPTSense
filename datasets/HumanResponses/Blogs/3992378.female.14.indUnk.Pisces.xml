      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 1. The Irony of My Life  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Droplets of water from the faucet clash against the sink. Splat. Splot. Splash. The rhythmic beat continues on endlessly. The walls are gray and gloomy, with slight cracks and scratches in the corners. An ancient wooden bench stands unsteadily on my right, waiting for its days to be over. There are two filthy bunk beds in the room, even thought they are occupied by only one person, me. I guess I should be rather thankful that I’m the only one living in this cell, not being raped by the same sex and all, but I despise being lonely and left out. I’ve been here for…how long? With a pained moan, I twist my head around, to glance at one of the walls. I’ve been marking how long I’ve been here ever since I became imprisoned. Four big lines and three small lines… That’s 4 years and 3 days. For the last 1,427 days, I had to suffer through the depressing anti-drug/social life. The nasty food they give out here doesn’t help either. It just makes me crave for more and more of the outside world…  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am twenty-one years of age, still fresh and young. My parents named me Sally Rose Johnson, even though I was born the male gender. I guess they desperately wanted to have a daughter considering on the fact that they already had 6 boys of their own before I was born. That is, indeed, why they used to dress me up as a girl everyday when I was young. Of course, I didn’t know any better—until 3rd grade. People were making fun of me constantly, and I just couldn’t handle it. I confronted my parents one day, saying that I was a boy and I simply couldn’t be seen looking like a “prissy girl with pigtails” anymore. They took it extremely hard, cried for exactly 5 days and 16 hours, but eventually they agreed to make a deal that they would never make me dress up like a girl from that point on. After I finally started wearing boy clothes, I forced people to call me “Johnson” instead of my first name “Sally”. I thought it’d be a good way to begin my new “boyhood”. It took people a while to accept the name, but eventually, they all ended up calling me by the name that I desired.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having all six brothers that were into pot(marijuana), I began to experiment with drugs in 5th grade. I never really liked drugs, to be frank, but just the thought of being an “outlaw” kept me going. It’s pathetic, I know. In the next 2 years, before I knew it, I was selling drugs to kids that I both knew and didn’t know, encouraging them to join in. I had tons of sources to get drugs from— all over the state, partially because all my brothers were close friends with them. I charged drugs twice as much as other people did, but since I had the biggest variety, people came to me anyway. Before I knew it, I was actually rich. That was without a doubt the upside of my life. The downside of it…Well, let me tell you all about it…  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 2. Four years ago…  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A puff of smoke exhaled out of the corner of my dry mouth. Being a senior was such a difficult task. No wonder people drop out of high schools. Who in the world would want to deal with colleges? Using only one hand, I veered smoothly to the right to exit out of highway. I was riding in a brand new BMW, bought recently using my own money, I’m proud to say. I’d saved enough money for the past years that I was able to afford a car and a good car at that. With my left hand, I slowly stuck the joint into my mouth and inhaled. It felt incredibly refreshing and relaxing. But I should’ve known better. Getting high while driving is over the line, even for me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, some random ancient-looking Toyota jumped into my lane without any signal, or if there was, I couldn’t see and I completely lost the control of my car, Yelling in horror, I turned left, attempting to avoid a car crash. Oddly enough, I succeeded, but ended up doing a 360-degree turn and in the progress, the car crashed into a pole nearby, scratching and leaving a dent on the surface. Thankfully, there weren’t any cars behind me that could’ve gotten damaged along with mine. Being a protective car that it was, my car’s air bag popped out. I let out a muffled scream, my face heavily digging into the air bag. My hands trying to find the door handle, unlocked the door in a clumsy fashion. My body stumbled out the door, dropping the joint that I held in my hand onto the cement ground. I was breathing so fast that I thought my heart was beating 200 beats per minute. Finally calmed down, I turned to look at the damage done; let me tell you this, it didn’t look so good. I let out a sigh of frustration when I heard a voice.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What happened here?”” A drawl came behind my back. Swiftly, I turned myself around. Because of the drug I was smoking, I nearly lost my balance in the process, but soon I was able to recollect myself. I concentrated my eyes on the person standing in front of me; it was a middle-aged cop. He had bushy copper hair that was poking out of his brand new Police hat. His tiny black eyes were almost invisible on his flabby red face. It made him look something between a fat filthy lion and an unattractive toad.&nbsp; I murmured out a curse as I stared silently at the man. Just play it cool, and everything will be all right, I thought to myself.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Nothing at all. I just had to U-turn for a sec because I just remembered I forgot to bring something from home. I guess, I...um...” I nervously glanced back at my car, my face twitching at the damage. “Turned too fast.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer seemed to be examining the damage in slow motion. But then something else caught his eye— the smoked joint that was now lying abandoned on the ground. His posture tightened as he motioned for me to come forward. From his pocket, he took out a long piece of paper, with different-sized dots on it. My eyes widened in worry and suspicion. Uh-oh. What in the world is that for? Although I’d been selling and taking drugs for years now, I scarcely knew anything about what happened to you when you got caught.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “See this?” He said, with a triumphant grin on his face. “It’s called Pupillometer, if you ever heard of one. It tells you how big your pupils are. Don’t worry, sonny. It won’t hurt ya. It’ll just tell me if they’re the size they’re supposed to be.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I froze immediately. I could hear my heart drumming intensely. Long ago, hadn’t my brothers told me that every time you get high on speed, your pupils would become at least 3 times its normal size? This was not good news. How stupid could I be? I slowly began to back away from the officer in caution. Droplets of sweat were forming on my forehead. I licked my dried lips and stuttered, “I r-r-really must g-g-get going…” Just before I was about to sprint over to my car, the man grabbed onto my wrist and pulled me back.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let’s just see,” He gritted his teeth and stuck the Pupillometer right next to my eyes. I guess they were as big as he wanted them to be, because after a split second, he had sparkles in his tiny black eyes. He pulled out a mini clipboard and a pen from one of his many pockets and inquired, “Your age?”  Should I lie or not? Was this something that I should be lying about or what? Oh well… The truth couldn’t hurt. Minors don’t get sent to jail or anything.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Seventeen.” I muttered, looking down at my Nike shoes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Name?”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paused. “Sally Johnson.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer looked up fiercely, and glared into my over-sized pupils.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m not here to joke around with you, kid. Give me your Driver’s License.”  Frowning in utter annoyance and disgust, I dug into my wallet and pulled out my card. He snatched it away from my fingers impatiently. He stared at it in disbelief. Awkward seconds ticked by, and finally he took his eyes off it and wrote down, “Sally Rose Johnson” onto his clipboard.  “Well, it was nice meeting you, Sally.” His eyes were laughing. “You are free to go without any charge this time, but the next time I see you with a joint, you will be in trouble.” He marched over to his car, turned on the engine and drove away.  A frustrated roar exploded out of my mouth. One stupid joint and I’m partially ruined; well, at least my beautiful car was. I kicked the pole nearby with ferocity. I took a worried glance at my wracked car. Perfect…Just what I needed…  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 3. The Next Day  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty-one. Twenty-two. Twenty-three…Auugh, Who knew that counting lines on the ceiling would be so difficult? It was a pointless thing to do, without a doubt, but at least it kept me busy. And it also took my mind off things—such as what happened yesterday. Yesterday! My eyes gleamed in fury at the thought. I cursed out loud in vain and thrust my head into my pillow.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the officer had gone, I managed to drive my car to a car repair shop on the corner. They took some time inspecting the damage and then claimed that it’d cost 200 dollars in total to repair the whole thing. Of course, I totally flipped out. I screamed at them saying that they were a rip-off and threatened to sue them for being such a pain in the neck. I went around the shop in circles, waving my arms around in indignation, yelling at each and every one of them that I was certainly not going to pay TWO hundred bucks on something that’d only take $100 to fix. When one of them threatened to make a call to the Police, I immediately stopped. It wasn’t going to do me any good to get into trouble with the Police again. I took a deep breath, walked up to the manager and told them that I’d have the money in two days and I’d be back to retrieve my car. I’m such a messed up person, I know. But you may also want to consider the fact that I was still high when I was making the scene.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I walked all the way home in utter depression. How in the world was I going to get the money? I’d already spent all my fortune buying the car and paying the house rent. I didn’t have a dime in my pocket. I was as broke as ever. All my brothers were out of town this month, so I couldn’t borrow money from them. My friends? They were in the state of poverty; they didn’t have enough money to buy themselves lunch.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was only one option left: Alex Masterson. He’d been my customer ever since Middle School. I’d never been too fond of him, considering the fact that he’s always been one depressed, deprived, anti-social loner. But he always came to me to buy some and I never had the heart to turn him down. It wasn’t until this year when he started owing me money. His parents supposedly had stopped giving him his allowance because they found out that he was doing drugs with it. Counting up all the money he now owes me, it’s probably 600 dollars. I’d been patient. I’d been nice. But now it was time to retrieve my money back. I wouldn’t care if he denied or refused to give it back to me. I would get it back today.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I jumped out of the bed that I was in and marched over to my closet. Standing on my toes, I reached up and grabbed the wooden box that I was looking for. Groaning, I lifted the heavy box up and gently brought it down onto the ground. On the top, it read, “PROPERTY OF FRED JOHNSON” The box had once belonged to my father. But when he passed away, I took over and kept it in my possession. I doubt that my brothers even knew about it or else they would’ve fought over it for decades. I slowly opened the box, excitement taking over my body. The light reflected against the sleek black surface of it. It was a M-9, a pistol. I carefully lifted it up and checked to make sure bullets were still in there. They were. A mischievous grin rose on my face. Now this was going to be entirely fun.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 4. Why Did I Bother?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sky was already darkened when I entered Alex’s gate. Boldly, I marched up to the door and knocked. He’d better be there, I thought. Alex lived in a 4-stories-high building that had 13 rooms, each the size of my entire house. Pretty rich, huh? Well, that’s why I decided to do this whole thing in the first place. If I had known his family wasn’t rich, I wouldn’t have bothered to come to his doorstep to ask for the money. I thought, if he didn’t have the money, his family would have to chip in some, and believe me—they’d always had at least a couple hundreds with them in their wallet.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened and Alex’s face appeared in the gap. His face was thin and freckled, covered with an array of bulbous pimples. His hair was messy and unkept, as if he just woke up. His blond eyebrows furrowed notably when he saw that it was me, Johnson, at his doorstep.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What do you want?” He drawled, rubbing his nose.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave him a malicious smile. “You know what I want: the bucks that you owe me,” I replied quietly. The night air was chilly and the winds were blowing in my ears. “Mind if I come in, Alex?” I asked, still smiling. “It’s cold out here.” I took a step towards the door, and he thrust a hand out, hesitantly. A worried expression was still stuck on his face.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My parents don’t allow me to invite strangers in.” He stuttered, nervously.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s when all hell broke loose; well at least for him, it did. In fury, I whipped out my pistol from the inside of my jacket and put it an inch away from his heart. The smile on my face was gone now. This was serious. The most serious I’d ever been in my life. His eyes widened so big in terror that I was almost sure that they were going to drop out of their sockets. He backed away slowly, his whole body trembling.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Give me the money. This is not a game. I need that money and I will get it,” I declared fiercely. He didn’t respond. He appeared to be frozen in place. I doubt he was even breathing.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a new voice was to be heard. “Alex, who is it?” it was a woman’s voice. The footsteps from his house came closer and closer to the front door, and I whispered urgently, “Give me the money, Masterson. And your mommy wont have to know about this.” Unfortunately, he was still too frozen to talk or respond to the new threat so he stood there, plaintively. Then his mother finally appeared right next to her son. She was probably around her 50s, but with barely any wrinkles on her face. (Plastic surgeries, maybe) She had a natural grace about her, obviously being one of those sophisticated middle-aged women type who constantly drinks tea and carries around an umbrella even when it’s not raining. She was even about to smile at me in welcome but when she saw me holding the pistol, a terrified gasp escaped her mouth. She looked as if she was going to get a heart attack.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should’ve turned back and ran away right then and there. Even I knew that it wasn’t going to be pretty when an adult gets involved, but I don’t know what took over me. Instead, I pointed the gun to Alex’s mom and pulled the trigger. BAAM! A pained scream from his mom was followed by the shooting sound, making it echo down the street. Blood flowed down body, making thick trails. She clutched the bleeding spot, stared right into my eyes, and collapsed onto the ground.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“MOM!” Alex roared, as he bent down to lift up his mother’s dead body. Tears streamed down his face. He bent over to check her pulse, but there was nothing. He moaned over and over again in sorrow and pain, shaking her body as if to wake her up from the dead.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared at the scene like a dummy. I didn’t really think I was going to kill anyone… It was only a dreamed fantasy I had. Then the reality hit me: I was the murderer. His mom was the victim. I killed somebody that never did anything to do. My eyes widened in realization as my hand dropped the pistol that I had. Before I knew it, I was sprinting away from Alex’s street, house, and the dead body. I ran like I never had before. If there were a shooting star at the time, I probably would’ve kept up the same speed. I ran and ran and ran for hours to come…Partly because of the Police that Alex probably made a call to, and partly because I was trying to run away from the sin I caused. I was so afraid and aghast, I couldn’t stop running…  &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 5. Back to Reality  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I snort in scorn. Well, I should’ve ran faster. If I did, maybe I wouldn’t have gotten caught by the Police the next day. I was hiding behind a clothing store when I was found, eating a stolen sandwich. Sad, isn’t it? How low can a person get, really? To end the story short, I got sentenced 6 years of imprisonment in court. And now I still have almost 2 years to go. I’m still sorry that I had to end up killing someone. Dummies like me, though, I guess, keep the world going. I grin ironically to myself. Just wait until I get out of here. Then the world would see…

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The key slips in the lock and in one sudden movement, the door is unlocked. Quickly yet clumsily, I glide through the opening gap, my heart beating to its fastest speed. If I get caught here, at my own house, God knows who's going to dig me up from my grave when my parents are done burying me alive. My destination is only 50 feet away; my room. Once I reach there, I can guarantee my safety; I can lock the door and continue on with whatever I was planning on to do. Even if my parents realize I'm home and ask for me to come out, I'll be okay because by then, I would've already hidden the paper bag.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slowly begin tiptoeing to my room. My dad is probably already back from work and my mom is probably in the kitchen, cooking. I clutch the brown paper bag with my cold, frozen hands. I don't have any jacket or backpack at hand at the moment that I could put the damn thing in, so I'm practically forced to carry it like that, no matter how idiotic I might look when I get caught.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when I'm only halfway there, I get an unexpected surprise attack. The front door flings open, and icy breeze whips in. Before I could even jump and turn to see who it is, I recognize my parents'&nbsp;voices calling out in joyful greetings. I curse loudly in my mind, thinking this is not what was supposed to happen at all. Everything had gone wrong and if I don't do something quick, I'll surely be dead by dawn. I break out into a sprint, yelling back, "hold on, BATHROOM! Be right back!" as I turn my upper body around to look back at my parents' reactions. Bad move. By doing so, my dad manages to catch a glimpse of the bag in my hands and roars out, "YOU! Come back here! What's that thing you have in your hands?" I ignore him completely and keep on running. When I reach my room, I swiftly slam the door shut and lock it. I hear my dad's large body colliding into the wooden door and him yelling, "That bag! Hand it over to me! There's no way I'm going to let you do this again!" The ancient door screeches loudly and painfully as it fights against his heavy weight, refusing to give up. Droplets of sweat dribble down from the sides of my terrified face. My eyeballs roll about desperately in my sockets, trying to find any possible exit out of the room. No escape. None. Nada. Zip. Zero. Unless I dare count the mini-sized window in the corner as one. No way is my body going to fit in that 12 inches wide, 6 inches high hole. There is only one way out of all this: I will wait until Dad finally gives up and goes to sleep and then that's when I will sprint out of this cursed house and hide up in my friend's attic. Meanwhile, till that opportune time, I'll wait in my room patiently. My parents wont dare calling the police. The last time they did it, they did not like the results, at all.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carry myself lazily into a corner of my room, blocking out the hideous noises that the parents are making at the moment. I let my cold, clammy hand swipe over the dribbling sweat from my forehead. My heartbeat gradually slows down its rhythm, back to its normal speed. Then I glance back at the bag I'm holding--the thing that got me in this situation in the first place. What made me like this? How did I manage to resort to this? I lamely murmur to myself, "it's only LSD...Nothing harmful." With an invisible sigh, I lightly throw the bag in front of me, miraculously making none of the content spill. My blood-shot eyes are glued to the object, and I silently continue sitting in the same position as I was before.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Temptations start rising within me. I'm tired and bored out of my mind. Tick-tock. The clock is ticking by so slowly, I feel like screaming out the window. Tick-tock. Maybe I should have a little bit of it, and then time would pass by more quickly. Tick-tock. But if I try it, without a doubt, I'm going to end up forgetting about the whole running-away-from-home thing, and I cannot afford to lose the chance. Discouragingly, I turn my eyes away from the bag. I can't do this. Tick-tock. Another minute passes by, and I can still hear my dad battling against the door. It is only 8:58. I still have a plenty of time before my parents' bedtime. URRGH! I snatch up the brown paper bag from the ground and impatiently open it. The kind that I managed to get my hands on weren't the usual kinds. They were tablets instead of being in a liquid form, which are, I decided, easier to have or carry around.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tentatively shove in several of those and lie down on the carpeted floor. The bitter taste fills my mouth. I almost get the urge to spit it all out, but after considering how much it took me to achieve again, I manage to contain myself. After what seems like 30 long minutes, I begin to feel it coming on.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I start grinning wildly for without a reason, and cannot stop. The ceiling that I was staring at for the last 30 minutes suddenly becomes animated, as if the paint was whirling around, dancing in endless, uncountable patterns. It somehow reminds me of a chess game--The black knight jumps up, takes a route, and slams down onto a block. The white queen glides over smoothly, leaves a blue trail, and lands on a purple spot. Green, yellow, brown, black, blue...the colors are so amazing, so soothing. I can even feel the swirling colors embracing me, telling me that everything will be all right. I glance over to my right, to check the alarm clock. My body twists and turns, but I fail miserably to find it. Instead, I become distracted by these wondrous colors that are all over the walls, carpet, posters, books, and everything. It is as if watching a TV without having the power to control.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft gentle spring breeze knocks at my window, and slips in without any permission. Maybe it already knows it's welcome, I don't know. My eyes capture the slow, exotic movements the breeze makes as it swerves around the corners of my colorful paradise. My eyebrows furrow, distractedly. It is incredibly hard for me keep my eyes open. It feels as if every single drop of liquid has vanished from my eyes and the rest of my body. The incredible dryness in my eyes is killing me throughout. I clutch my hair tightly, biting my lips in pain.  Suddenly, I'm distracted by some foreign noises. I quickly open my eyes, only to find myself seeing the noises that are coming outside the door. The noises don't just travel invisibly; they travel in the form of birds, some white pigeons and some fierce-looking eagles. They are floating towards me, swiftly and fast. When they reach me, they begin pecking at my body with their sharp beaks, and my ears can't handle them. I shriek out loud in ultimate pain, my hands flying around everywhere to shoo away the attacking creatures. But they just won't stop! I frantically take off my shoe in order to hit them with it, but despite my effort and struggle, the sounds get louder and louder and the birds get bigger and fatter. I can't stand it. I cover up my ears with my bird-bitten hands. The birds seem to blow up like balloons. And just like balloons, they seem to pop into little pieces, which fell on the ground and magically changed into little red ants. To my shock and fear, the ants begin crawling fast towards me. I scream even harder than I ever did in my whole entire life. My face is already dripping with blood from the birds; I can even taste it from licking a corner of my mouth. I stomp, squash, brush them away from my body, but yet nothing works. No matter what I do, they refuse to die and leave me alone in peace. My heart beats faster and my breaths become shorter and more desperate by the second. Suddenly, I discover I don't have any energy left in me to fight or struggle anymore...My legs collapse on the ground and so does my body and into the darkness I pass out...
