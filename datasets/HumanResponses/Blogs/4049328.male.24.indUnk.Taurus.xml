AN EXCELLENT QUOTE VERY RELEVANT TO ANYONE STUDYING IN COLLEGE/SCHOOL          "But you go to a great school, not for knowledge so much as for arts and habits; for the habit of attention, for the art of expression, for the art of assuming at a moment's notice a new intellectual posture, for the art of entering quickly into another person's thoughts, for the habit of submitting to censure and refutation, for the art of indicating assent or dissent in graduated terms, for the habit of regarding minute points of accuracy, for the habit of working out what is possible in a given time, for taste, for discrimination, for mental courage and mental soberness."   - William Johnson Cory (1861)

A lie would have no sense unless the truth were felt as dangerous.         ~  urlLink Alfred   Alder  ~          T hat in the beginning when the world was young there were a great many thoughts but no such thing as truth.

There is an inmost center in us all, where truth abides in fullness and to Know rather consists in opening out a way whence the imprisoned splendor may escape than in effecting entry for light supposed to be without.         ~  urlLink Robert   Browning  ~          T here is no such source of   error as the pursuit of truth.         ~  urlLink Samuel   Butler  ~          A  few observation and much   reasoning lead to error; many observations and a little reasoning to truth.         ~  urlLink Alexis   Carrel  ~          Y ou can only find truth with   logic if you have already found truth without it.         ~  urlLink Gilbert   K.
