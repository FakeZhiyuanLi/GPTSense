      I never thought I'd say this, but there is no place like home. It's not so much my home I missed on my week-long hiatus from home, but my room, or rather, my "womb", as it has been aptly named. I spend hours upon hours in here, doing "God knows what" (the parents). I actually spend it here, on the computer, like a loser. I'm not really sure where I'm going with this, so I'm going to stop and save myself the grief of scratching my head thinkin' "What the hell am I talking about?" ***END TRANSMISSION***

      Right. So, I was asked to house sit for a friend while she and her husband are away. Nothing too stressful, I have to feed the plants and water the cats...or was it the other way around? In any event, the whole thing is a non-event. Or, it should have been. Today, my first day on the job, I open the garage, pull the car in, and open the door. The alarm starts beeping...but since I am a master of recollection, I remembered the alarm code. What I didn't remember, however, was how to turn it off...which should have been fairly obvious now that I think about it, since there was a button that said "off" right on the key pad. Since I am a dumbass, I kept pressing "stay", because, well, I planned on staying there...at least for a little while. Here I am, entering the code, and pressing stay, over and over and over again. Finally, the alarm says "you're a complete moron" and goes off. It was then that I realized I had to press "off" after entering the code. I was too late. The alarm company calls, asks if everything is alright. I explained the situation, and the woman, pleasant sounding, yet slightly worried again asks me, "Are you sure you're ok?". I just wanted to yell, "Noo, I'm not ok! *sob* Mom, come pick me up!!!", but I didn't, because I am a fully capable individual. With the phone call over, I thought the whole ordeal was finished, and I could resume my responsibilities of feeding the cats and watering the plants. No such luck. Not 5 minutes later, I hear a *ring* and a *knock*. I think, "Oh great, it's the crazy neighbor guy they warned me about". No such luck, again. It was the Phoenix City Police. I invite her in, pushed the cocain under the floor boards while she wasn't looking (kidding), retrived some picture I.D., answered a couple questions ("Are you house sitting?" "What's the family's name?" "Do you have any idea what you're doing?"). I think the last one was rhetorical, so I didn't bother answering. After concluding that there was nothing unkosher going on, the lady cop left. I fed the cats (finally), H2O'd the plants, and spent 5 minutes deliberating over whether I should reset the alarm or not. Thus ends my first day as a house sitter. May the rest of the time be significantly less...dramatic. ***THE END*** (For now)

           Alrighty, out of sheer boredom, I have created this...erm...blog. What kind of name is blog anyway? It sounds like something you'd find up someone's nose...which is something I really don't want to think about right now. Alright then, for those who care, my name's Jenna. I am a senior who hopes to escape the grips of high school as soon as humanly possible. I plan to move onto bigger and brighter things, like..erm...college. Then, I have to get a real job and become an adult, but this isn't a new story, so I'll shut up. However, until that day arrives, I plan to remain under the impression that I can obtain a degree in dramatic writing/screenplay/script writing, and then have a fantastic intership at the Conan O'Brien show- and after I graduate, they'll hire me.       I'm actually spending a month in New York this summer at NYU in their dramatic writing workshop, so as to further my knowlege of what exactly I want to do. So, I'll keep anyone who visits and gives a damn in the loop on how that goes. If I had a digital camera, I'd post pictures. Unfortunately, my family is strictly Amish, and I have to sneak into a nearby town and go to their internet cafe. If they ever find out that I'm doing this, I shall be excommunicated from their society forever. (I'm so full of it)

      About a half-hour ago, I was sitting here at my desk. I was bored, and I felt a little hungry. I went to my pantry to look for something decent to snack on, but all that was in there were stale grape cookies, special K bars, and Hostess muffins (a.k.a a bypass surgery waiting to happen). So, I decided to grab a special K bar. It was disgusting...really, really, just nasty. So, to cure both boredom and hunger, I decided to go on a short trip to the local circle K nearby for something reasonable yet satisfying. I didn't want the calorie content of the hostess muffins, but I sure as hell knew I didn't want another special K bar. I quitely snuck out of my house, climbed into my car, and off I went.  I was the only person in the circle K, naturally. I mean, who goes to a convieniance store at 1:45 in the morning unless they're planning to rob it, or they're stoned out of their mind (I actually was neither stoned, nor did I have intentions of robbing the place, but I'm sort of an exception). Anyway, there I was, amidst aisles of corn chips, snickers bars, trail mix and beef jerky. I only had 2 bucks, so my options were limited. I pondered just getting some diet cherry coke, which, looking back would have been the better option, but instead, I wound up getting two tiny protein bars (150 calories each) and a small pack of gum. What started out as being a small quest for something to munch on became a 310 (including 2 sticks of extra winterfresh whatever gum) calorie bust. I ended up eating both bars because I'm stupid.  To be fair, I haven't eaten anything but chicken broth and a small portion of strawberry sorbet today, but still, that doesn't justify my wasting gas only to end up consuming 310 calories, which wasn't the objective. The objective was to avoid the 300 calorie Hostess Muffins. Instead, I have less gas in my tank and more "junk in my trunk", as I have heard it phrased. Anywho, this brought me to a revalation, this is why America is fat. We do stupid shit like this with our food all the time. Normally, I'm pretty good about it, but I know people who constantly pull these stunts.   Obesity exists because we're bored. Most of us eat when we're bored...and don't deny it, you know we do! So, this has inspired me. The next time I'm bored, I'm going to go for a run or a bike ride...  Lesson learned.

      This is when my address (idontremembereatingthat.blogspot.com) is most appropriate. I don't if it was the taquitos or the hamburger from the other day, but christ, let me just say, I NEVER want to be that ill again.  Suspect number one. El Monterey Chicken Taquitos. Greasy, unhealthy, and frozen. I can't look at them without my stomach curling into a tight little knot. I basically ate them because I was lazy and hungry and didn't feel like cooking something. I now regret my decision.  Suspect number two. The hamburger. It cost me what I thought was only going to be .85 cents. It may have cost me much, much more. Shall I ever know? Sadly, I think not.  And there you have it. I lost liquid out of every single oriface (even my nose) of my body in a period of 5 hours. On the bright side, I did lose 8 pounds. That was pretty sweet.

      I just have one question. ONE...question. In todays fast-paced world of dishwashers, vaccums, flying cars, and- hold on;  What? Can't you see I'm ranting here? What's that? No flying cars yet? Seriously? Wow, that's a shame.  Ahem...anywho, in today's fast-paced world of dishwashers and vaccums, why is it that a site as prestegious as 'blogspot' wouldn't have direct image hosting? WHY? Do not forget your technologically inept users, BLOGGER. We, despite our heavy ignorance and stupidity, are still people! People who just want to share our thoughts, ideas, and vacation photos! Instead, I only have this:   ">.   SEE WHAT YOU HAVE REDUCED ME TO? DO YOU? This damned 'x' thing! NOTHING. IT'S NOTHINGNESS for christ's sake! Curse you, Blogger, why do you torment me with the promise of free expression, but leave the technological strings attached? Oh! THE HUMANITY! The GALL! The TENACITY! The...the...erm...what was I talking about? Oh yes. Damned indirect image hosting. I hope you're happy, Blogger...there, I've gone and wasted what could have been a perfectly good post. Curse you! *Shakes fist at sky*

      ...it's a helluva town. I made it back alive from my month-long adventure in the big apple, where I was a student of Dramatic Writingat NYU. It was a very good experience (a), because I had a blast, and (b), it saved my parents the hassle of spending 40,000 dollars in tuition only to find that I didn't think the school was right. I'm far too practical,I think. I can't justify going to school for 4 years learning how to format a screenplay. It was fun while it lasted, though. I wanted to post pictures of the trip, but unfortunately, this damned 'blog' site doesn't host images directlyfrom my hard drive. So, I am forced instead to show you all this photo of Morrissey molesting what looks to be a turkey of some sort.    .  Whew! That was fun. That just made my day...really. Anywho, back to the New York thing. It can basically be summed up in a quote from R.A. extrordinaire, Jeff, who so eloquently phrased the following:  "I HATE Helen Keller- she and Benedict Arnold. As we speak they're probably in Hell MAKING OUT"  Ahh....memories. Bear in mind that when that was said, the group, as a whole, had consumed an unhealthy levelof caffeine and sugar to combat the insatiable urge to sleep. I mean, who sleeps at 4:30 in the morning? What are we? SLOTHS?! I think not. That's basically how I spent most of the trip was staying awake at odd hours trying to crap out ideas and make them sound at least half-way decent. I wouldn't have made it were it not forthe good people at Spacemart. Now, the only way you can truely appreciate Spacemart is if you were THERE, man. Otherwise, the whole concept is lost on you, and you will forever sit in your puddle of ignorance. Now, what was I talking about? Ah yes, Spacemart. I love spacemart. And turkey. And Morrissey. ***END TRANSMISSION***
