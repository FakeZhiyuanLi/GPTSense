      Well, my school just had the racial harmony carnival on friday. Everything is so boring! It's the same as what happened last year...Sigh! Well, I have duties to do on that day as well.  In the morning, i was at the registration booth, giving out bottled drinks to VIPs. The funny thing is, they had NEWater((Very small bottle)) and Distilled water((medium, 400cc)). Of Course the people will chose to take the bigger bottle of water!!! How Ridiculous it was to have bottles of different sizes! Well this was not the worst thing that happened..... And I almost had a nervous breakdown! When the GOH ((BG George Yeo)) walked past me, I was as good as frozen, I&nbsp;felt that my heart stopped beating....BUT I was fine after a while.  Ah, its the dunking machine again. Can't we have anything fresh? And the dunking machine is SOOOO expensive (($500 to rent))..what's the point of having it, when the budget is so high? The dunking machine&nbsp;is soooooo small oso....&nbsp;And that Cedric and Ronnie keeps shouting at me"OI, Go and get the balls la!". I kick their balls first ah!! Because of this, I went to my the study area, where my class was. They were having a "WET" game with buckets and balloons...Hehehe, I poured a bucket on water on each of the teachers, mrs see,mr lum and mrs leong, SONG BO!! I wished veg society and that ah koo was there la... and that ah koo keep insulting our stall leh, saying&nbsp;that&nbsp;its STUPID,&nbsp;but we make so much money....SHE then STUPID, her face makes me&nbsp;SICK!!!&nbsp;She so clever, go & setup stall la!! Actually, I pakat with Satheya and I chose the box with a slip of paper " FULL BUCKET OF WATER" HEHE..  When I went back to the dunking machine, those 2 people were shouting again!!! SiGh,, so I went to hide in the council room for a while. I WaS Q angry la, But BIG DEAL?? ME GET ANGRY WIF THOSE UNCIVILISED PPLE? OF COURSE NOT LA!! oh, minutes passed.... It was time for mr lum to be on the dunking machine!! I found him at 1E2's stall.. and I followed him there. This time, I helped him carry his stuff.....and hid in the crowd....  TO conclude, this year, my class did a better job then the last year la....the council also q. okie la...... BUT IT IS BORING LIKE HELL!!!!ZzzzzzzzZzZzZzZzZzZz  &nbsp;

      Another boring day in school...i feel damn exhausted man...   Well my science teacher is finally coming back!!! Bye Bye Mr Wang((RELIEF TEACHER))! Let me tell you more about my relief teacher for science.   Firstly, his appearance. His face..((oh my god)) is full of poker dots, so red and disgusting... AND his hair is sooooo old fashioned. It seems like the hair dresser put a bowl over his head before doing up his hair, it really looks like a mushroom. Oh, almost forgot something, he looks like a barbie doll!!!   Oh his lessons are really lousy because he does not no how to teach. Presently, my class is going on to the chapter on electricity for science. He SIMPLY screwed the class up..PATHETIC.. He cannot even pronounce his words properly.."Copy" is pronounced as "kopi" and "remember"--"LEmember"..haha. Even my english is better than him.   His actions are sooooooooooooooo gay, if you looked at him walking, i bet you'll laugh your hearts out. It seems that he has a problem with his testicles or penis. His legs are wide apart when he's walking. Oh the way he teaches...everytime he mumbles to himself and he does not know how to phrase his sentences!   Oh the council just recruited the sec 1s.. they look so blur and funny..haha. But they are talkative to the extreme limits!! I shouted at them twice before they decided to zip their mouths. Well seems that I've to be fierce to them before they listen to me.Haha.   Remember there's a cheeky malay((Im not racist la)) from my committee. He's late and he's still grinning, i wonder how his teacher chose him as a councillor, sounds pretty RIDICULOUS.   Lots of homework to complete too! For literature, the class has to come up with a continuation of a play we've just studied. Worst still, we work in pairs and there are two characters, the mother and the son. Well, I've decided to work with Timothy, he's gonna be the mother and I'm the small cute little son!! Oh.. i remember, for the odyssey of the mind competition, we got the 2nd runner up maybe because of his "gay" acting.Well, back to the literature homework. Oh, i must be v sensitive this time, its an issue on racial discrimination...so troublesome!! It's gonna be HOGWASH!!

						   Yes, I agree that Singapore Youths are spoilt brats.  &nbsp;  Firstly, to define the key terms: "Youths" refer to young adults, aged between 13-20, while "spoilt brats" refer to a spoilt child who has been pampered such that he or she becomes very selfish or self-centered.  &nbsp;  Yes, I agree that Singapore youths are spoilt brats because they take things for granted.  &nbsp;  Today's youths in general, take things for granted; they do not cherish what they have now, until everything is lost.&nbsp; In singapore, most families have both parents as&nbsp;breadwinners, and do not have anytime for their own children. Therefore, the negliected children, would not be able to communicate with their parents well, hence, becoming a selfish person who does not appreciate what their own parents have given them, for example,a comfortable home to live in. They demand for unecessary items such as a branded pair of shoes or expensive handphones and worst still, they demand for more after using&nbsp;them for a short period only.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Therefore, I conclude that Singapore youths are spoilt brats because they take things for granted.  &nbsp;  Secondly, Singapore youths&nbsp;are spoilt brats because they have never experienced any form&nbsp;hardship before.  &nbsp;  When our ansectors came to Singapore, they faced lots of hardship and learnt to compromise, to solve the problems, hence becoming&nbsp;trifity and humble.&nbsp;Youths today never experience hardship before, because of their&nbsp;forefathers, who contributed to the development of Singapore-&nbsp;what it is today, wealthy and civilised.&nbsp; They do not know how&nbsp;is it like to live without&nbsp;basic necessities, for example, food, education, money.. they only know how to take things for granted, and only know how to complain when they are&nbsp;not&nbsp;satisfied with what they have now.  &nbsp;  Therefore, I conclude that Singaporean youths are spoilt brats&nbsp;because they have never faced any hardship before.
