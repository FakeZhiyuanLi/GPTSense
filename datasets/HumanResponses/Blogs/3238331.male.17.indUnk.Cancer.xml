       DewU points entered: 505   The fun of using Live-CD Linux distributions is starting to wear off. They were just a little too confusing for a noob like me to use. I'm using a new VS, its called  urlLink Classix 10k 2.0  and I like it about the same as LunaVX, they are both awesome and so much better than the Windows XP default. I'm going to a wedding today, my cousins. It should be interesting(not really), and hopefully it doesn't last that long. Not that I don't that my cousin is getting married, I think that it's great, but I have never really liked going to weddings. I'm hoping to have 550 DewU points by the end of next week, but it will be close. They still have some green Xbox's left, so I could be lucky enough to get one. Have to go get ready to go to the wedding, bye.

Now I have to wait until PCI Express motherboards come out so I can  get one of these to put into my new computer. I may get lucky and have them both get out in June so I'll have my new computer before my birthday.

It was only a matter of time, but at least it was not made for Itanium  instead of Opteron or Althlon64.

       DewU points entered: 491   After looking around, I have decided that Gnoppix looks a lot better that Knoppix, I like the Gnome desktop environment more than KDE(downloading it now). Hey, slightly funny thing happened today. At work, they have a two hour limit on computer time, and since my job involves very little work, I'm on the computer most of the time. A lot of the time I just ask for the Guest card to use if I waste all of my minutes, but today I decided to try something new. I brought my Knoppix CD with me to work, and when my two hours were up I popped it into the drive(For some reason they have  the Bios accessible and the boot order already started with the CD-rom drive,ehh makes my life easier)and it brings me to the screen that asks whether I want to start it up, I say yes. Then the CD-rom drive starts making the loudest noises I have ever heard a drive make. It was about ten times louder than my CD drive! So I quickly took it out as soon as I could and tried to act like nothing happened. Oops!   David Copperfield is progressing slowly, not that the book is slow to start off, but more the fact that I spend way too much time on the computer and don't spend any time at home reading. Most of my reading gets done in class, when I have nothing better to do, and have no computer to go on to. I'm either going to read another Charles Dickens book or a book by H.G. Wells once I'm finished with David Copperfield.  I expect to post another picture of my house soon, after the brick has been clean and when it's sunny out, it looks very nice. ...I think this may be the longest post I have done, not counting BlogThis! posts, I find this to be a good indicator that I may be getting better at typing. That's it for now, can't think of anything else to write about.

       urlLink 'Pirate Act' raises civil rights concerns | CNET News.com :  "File swappers concerned about getting in trouble with record labels over illegal downloads may soon have a major new worry: the U.S. Department of Justice."   This better not get passed, as it will probably cause me to have to stop sharing files, by either having my parents tell me to stop or by having myself be too afraid to do it. I may have to become a "leecher"(shudders at the thought). I'll just have to cross my fingers it does not get passed.  P.S. Uhmmm...I don't actually indulge in such illegal activities and do not support anyone who does, so don't tell anyone I do because I don't(yeah..rightttt)

       DewU points entered: 465   Decided to try out the Gentoo live-cd also, so I can hopefully find a distribution that I like by testing out the live-cds. Only 85 more points to go, and the Xbox shall be mine. Going to a wedding on Saturday, my cousin is getting married. I'd rather be going to another Halo marathon, but it's my cousins wedding, and I think I should do the right thing and go to it. I've almost had a Blog for a whole month, yay me.   G4 is going to be finishing up their takeover of TechTv on Friday, which sucks because the shows I've seen on G4 all are horrible. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it, but at least they are keeping  urlLink The Screensavers . Have to go burn a Gentoo Live-cd, so I'll end my post.

       DewU points entered: 454   Knoppix is great! I guess a lot of people probably say that after being on Windows computer their whole, but still, its very interesting to try out a new OS. In fact, I'm making this post in Knoppix. This may make me make a partition on my computer for something like Mandrake(I've heard that it's the best for newbies).   I've also decided to take a break from reading new books all the time, and to try out some classics. I just finished Frankenstein, and have now started on David Copperfield. Frankenstein wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, and David Copperfield is shaping up to be a good book as well. I'm off to see if I can set up BlogThis! to make some more posts in Knoppix.

I plan on trying out Knoppix tomorrow, looks very interesting, I've always wanted to try Linux but didn't want to go through the hassle of installing it on a partition and   dual booting with Windows. It should be interesting. That's all for now, have to get some sleep.

       urlLink Yahoo!

Wow, they are very "creative" over in Argentina, but I mean really, just put the guy in jail, it seems kind of like they are letting him off easy. I know surgerys aren't fun to watch, but still, only having to watch a surgery after killing someone doesn't make much sense.  P.S. I apologize for two BlogThis! posts in about five minutes, just trying to get everything in before I have to get off.

Today made up for it in a way because I got to go to a friends house and play Halo. There were eight people there, and it was great. I said yesterday I was going to post a pic of our house but I was too tired. I'll post one in a few minutes. Listening to the new Slipknot album right now, Very enjoyable. That's all I can think of right now, guess I'll go find a pic of our house.

I also saw that PhotoBlog thing, and may get a chance to try it out later tonight, if I don't get kicked off. Only 150 more points to getting an Xbox, so close that I can almost feel the controller in my hand. I would have never thought that having a Blog would be such hard work, especially for me since I have not progressed past the stage where I don't need to look at the keyboard to type. Oh well, guess it's time to end this post, but do not fret, as I shall be back tomorrow(Are those groans I hear, surely they are groans of happiness).

This amuses me. Good job Google, that's a sure way to get people to use your email, give them a terabyte to store their emails. To bad it's not real, that would be awesome, although they would probably have limits on the size of the emails you could send, even if they were able to offer that much storage.

In an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the video game industry trade show E3 here, Todd Hollenshead said that the game in question was new intellectual property, and was not a 'Doom', 'Quake' or 'Wolfenstein' game.  He offered few details on the style or content of the game, other than to say the id team would start serious work on it in short order, possibly a matter of days, after moving on from the PC and later Xbox releases of the new 'Doom 3'."  Hmm..I want to know what it will be.

The upgrade is part of an overall enhancement for Yahoo Mail that will launch this summer. Besides additional storage, the service will get a face-lift and tie in more Yahoo-branded services, such as Photos and Messenger.  The announcement comes a month after search rival Google said it would launch a free e-mail service called Gmail that offers 1GB of storage, considerably more space than free versions of Yahoo Mail and Microsoft's Hotmail. Yahoo currently offers 4MB of storage to free users of its e-mail service.  The company's decision to boost its e-mail storage is not surprising. A day before Gmail details were unveiled, Yahoo sent e-mails to some customers in hopes of gauging their interest in receiving 100MB of storage.  The company said the e-mail was just a typical consumer survey for its 'loyal consumer base' and denied that it had any relation to the news of Gmail."  Found this to be interesting.

I love this blog, It's fun to just post whatever I want whenever I want. Have to work tommorow,(Sarcastic)so that should be fun(/Sarcastic). I'm thinking of getting a new template, Well, actually i'd like to make my own but I can't find any tutorials or anything that would teach me how to do so. If you know of any or can help me out, you can always post a comment. You know what, I really like my Visual Style.

         Sorry I haven't posted in so long, many things conspired against me to keep from doing so. E3 has been great, as always, with a lot of new stuff coming out. I enjoyed reading all the articles out there and watching the trailers for the all the games.    My wish list that I created from games I saw:   DOOM 3 Half-Life 2 Halo 2 FF7 Advent Children Final Fantasy 12 GTA: San Andreas    If you think I need to add any other games I'll go check them out and if they look good I'll add them to my list. I want to start a website but I can't decide on anything good to base it around, so i'll probably end up not making one. Oh Well....at least there are a lot of good sites out there for me to visit. Hey, just saw that Google Adsense is going to let Webmasters have image ads instead of just text ads, I don't really mind because Ads have never really bothered me, most of the time I never even notice them. Well, I wanted to type more but I'm being pestered by my brother so hopefully I can get back on tonight and finish.  P.S.  I need more links to but on my sidebar, if anybody can think of some great sites to put on there that would be nice.

          I decided to get rid of the Blue's News link because it just didn't look good over there, and everyone knows looks are the most important thing:)Had an okay day, no work today unless you consider homework work. I had to do this stupid Report and Poster thing about a college that took me about 2 hours to finish. I also updated my profile to something that at least looks like I put some work into it, and no, the picture does not depict what I actually look like. Id and Activision have finally given Doom 3 an official release date, well kind of, because they just had a press release type thing where they said it would be coming this summer. I shall finally be able to play it, and hopefully on a new computer that will have a small chance of playing it at somewhere close to its full potential. In fact here's a  urlLink link  to the PC I hope to buy. It's pretty nice, but I think i'm going to change the video card to something better. I'm up to 304 caps for the Mountain Dew  Dew U  promotion, well on my way to an Xbox. That's it for now, I'll probably be getting kicked off the computer pretty soon, so might as well get off now.

         I made the Blue's News Link a little bit wider and changed the background to white, I'm getting close to a point where I think I'll like it, otherwise I'll just get rid of it and find another site to link to. Thats actually all I have time to post at the moment, because i have to go get ready for school.

         Just spent hours creating the two new links(You can take hours to mean 15 minutes). They look good so far although I think i'm going to work on the Blue's News a little bit more. I just noticed that I haven't talk about the DEW U promotion that Mountain Dew is doing. I'm saving up 550 points to get an Xbox, because I don't have one and I can get a green one from Mountain Dew. I have collected about 290 so far, so as long as they don't run out  I'll be able to get one. If anyone drinks Mountain Dew and are not participating send your codes my way, my email is llaeolusll@yahoo.com, Thanks in advance to anyone who helps out.     Just read the BestBuy ad from my Sunday paper and it says to go to there website to learn more about the X800 Pro. So I go there and guess what...They have it on sale, they say that its in stock, and that it will ship in 4 to 5 business days! Thats pretty amazing since I've heard that they weren't supposed to be out until June. So if you have $400 to spend on a new video card I suggest you go to BestBuy and get it before most people do. Oops, nevermind, just noticed that the Pro is coming out now and the XT isn't coming until June. Oh Well, I'll leave the first part of this paragraph anyways, can't hurt.  Guess thats it, time to get some sleep.

         As you can see I changed the Template to something that I think looks a lot better. I've also started adding some links, I've got Firefox in so far and plan on putting in a few more over the next couple days. E3 is about to start up pretty soon, I'll try to post some of the things that I find to be interesting.    Okay, now for some news.    German police have arrested a suspect on suspicion of creating the Sasser worm that has been making its way around the internet.    Epic is going to unveil Unreal Engine 3 to the public at E3, from what I've seen it looks amazing.    There are some Half-Life 2 previews on  urlLink GameSpy  and  urlLink IGN . They are pretty interesting reads, so I thought I would mention them.   That's it for now, so I guess I'll go surf the net for a while.

      Lets see, Lets see. Hmmm...Well Dell is offering up to 20% off there new systems to celebrate their 20th anniversary, which is pretty cool. To bad every time I try to customize a new computer it ends up going over my budget.  What else....Oh yeah! Sony looks like it will be matching the Xbox price at $149, probably around E3.  I think I'm going to buy UT2004, even though I have UT2003 I think that the amount of new stuff is worth shelling out $35.  Darnit, I have to get off. Well, at least I got some stuff in.

      For some reason i felt like writing a poem so here it is...   No need to be sad   Why must you always do this to me,  Acting so smug it makes me crazy.  You act like you don't care, Pretending you don't have to play fair. All I want is to be your friend, But I guess your heart is a heart i can never mend. You always act so tough, Because your life has been so rough. Even though everyone knows that deep inside, Your so sad that you contemplate suicide. I wish I could do something to help you, Because its hard to see you so blue Please let me into your life, Before you resort to a knife. Living really isn't that bad, If you have friends to make you glad.  ...well at least it rhymes, hope you like it

He was the third foreign hostage decapitated in the Middle East in little over a month."   Poor Bastard, This is getting out of hand. Three people this month. I just hope we don't give in to them because of this, we do that and it'll give them something to work with. As long as we don't give in threats like this, they can't win.

       urlLink Apple tapped for Defense Dept. research supercomputer - Computerworld :  "Apple Computer Inc. took a step forward and a step backward yesterday in its quest to prove itself a viable player in the world of high-performance computing.  The computer vendor announced a deal with U.S. Army contractor Colsa Corp. to build a 1,566-node supercomputer that's expected to be capable of as many as 25 trillion floating-point operations per second (TFLOPS), according to Colsa.  Called MACH 5 (Multiple Advanced Computers for Hypersonic Research), the $5.8 million system is designed to do aero-thermodynamic modeling for the Army's Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center. It's expected to be operational by November and, if it were benchmarked today, would rank just behind the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center's $350 million Earth Simulator, Colsa said. That hardware is capable of 35.9TFLOPS."   Oooh, I want a supercomputer. Hahaha, it's $345 Million less than the fastest one, and is about 4/9 as powerful. Crazy, but good. Soon everyone will have Supercomputers. I wonder when the limit will be drawn, how far can we go with computers? I guess I'll just have to see.

This brings the total people sued by the RIAA to well over 3,400.  We have often reported in the past on the music body and their on going anti-piracy campaign, aimed specifically at people who swap or download music on the Internet using peer-to-peer network services such as those provided by Kazaa.  All of the 482 suits filed are in America."   Damn it, they really need to stop doing this, it's pissing me off.

      Wow, five days without a post, I'm getting very lazy here. Still looking for a spot to get my blog hosted, if you feel like hosting me email me or leave a comment.

      Another hang out at the house and do nothing day, how exciting. Thought about inviting somebody over but then decided against it, It would take too much work to pick up the phone and call them. I really need to find something to do, maybe I'll go see a movie tomorrow.   Something bad happened to me today, and it sucks a lot. I went to go look to see how much money I had saved up to buy a computer, and I couldn't find my money! Hopefully my Parents just moved it or something, I don't know what else could have happened to it. On to happier news  urlLink Firefox 0.9  is out now, so go download it.   Kevin Rose did a great section on The Screensavers on how to mod an Xbox without having to open it up. It was very interesting, I'll have to try it when Mountain Dew decides to let me order my Xbox. We shall see.

      Sorry for not keeping up on this Blog, getting a little lazy with my old age. I switched over from Sonique2 to Winamp as my audio player, was bored of Sonique. I'm still playing the UT2004 demo, Onslaught is awesome and always will be. My name on there is  Hybris  for those who want to know.   My car had a flat this weekend, so didn't get to do much of anything. Got a new tire today but still need to have the struts fixed so it won't happen again...for a while anyways.  The ACT test I took on Saturday was so stupid. It was just a glorified MEAP test that I had to pay for. I can't believe Colleges actually look at that as a factor to determone if you get in or not. I guess it's good for me since it was easy for me.  I'm gonna go watch some TV, I'll hopefully post again soon.

I'm taking the ACT on Saturday, I don't really plan on studying but I'm sure I'll do well. I've been getting a little lazy when it comes to posting on this Blog, hopefully I can get going again. I'd like to blame it on the UT2004 demo. Decided to try it because I was bored and quickly got hooked on Onslaught, that is one fun game, fun and addictive. That's all I can think of, goodbye for now.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Apple Launches Faster Power Mac G5 Computer :  "Apple Computer Inc. rolled out its fastest-ever desktop computer on Wednesday with processors that run as fast as 2.5 gigahertz, but the company fell short of its earlier goal to offer a 3.0 gigahertz chip-based system by this month.  Apple has been counting on its chip supplier, IBM, to shrink the size of components to permit higher speeds for its microprocessors, the brains that run a computer. As more transistors are fit onto smaller circuits, the speed at which a processor can run increases."   For all of the Macophiles out there. 2.5 Ghz is pretty nice, to bad Macs cost so much, I may have considered one.

Unfortunately I have to wait until they release it, but I have enough points and I'll be checking every day to see if its available so I'll get one soon. I'm thinking of moving my blog to its own domain, so I can have it without the ads. I'm thinking of going with  urlLink CMD Hosting . With hosting and a domain it will only cost about $20 a year.   Hey, I May get a computer next week. One of the computers where I work has decided it doesn't want to work right anymore, so if I get lucky and they just want to throw it away, I could get to take it. It's the oldest computer in the whole system, so it won't be a great computer, but I can still use it as a Linux machine. At any rate I'm sure I can think of something to do with it.

       urlLink ATI admits to same "tricks" as Nvidia - News at GameSpot :  "Graphics company ATI, longtime critic of competitor Nvidia's video card driver optimizations, concedes to using undocumented optimizations of its own.  After criticizing rival Nvidia for using optimized trilinear filtering algorithms in its PC graphics card drivers--calling them 'unacceptable tricks' in a recent presentation to hardware reviewers last month--ATI Technologies has acknowledged using similar optimizations itself."   Well, you have to do what you have to do. I wonder how many people ATI or Nvidia think they are winning over by using "tricks" to make there cards look better.

Parents really need to start teaching there kids what to and what not to do on the internet. How hard is it to tell them not to click on anything or just limit them to a few safe sites. And if they are getting these things off p2p networks, parents shouldn't allow there kids to use them.

       DewU points entered: 521   Sorry for all the anti-Microsoft whining in this blog the last week or so. Windows XP is a great OS, I just don't like the icons or the VS. It was okay for me for a while, but I found better things. Went over a friends house on Tuesday, we were taking our MEAP day, which is a day off that our school gives us for taking the MEAP. We played some Halo and Morrowind, and then went to see The Day After Tomorrow. The special effects were great but the acting wasn't that good, neither was the story. Good thing it only costs me $5.50 because I'm a student. I changed the Google link again, it now says search on google instead of the great google, and the border is grey to match with the firefox one. Haha, I just reread the first sentence and it sounds like Microsoft had just sent me a threatening email. Or like they had sponsored this post or something similar to that.

The house is just about done, I think the carpeting got put in today and the 2nd floor has been painted, it's looking very good so far.     Schools coming up so I have to start on my reading for my AP Lit. class, the books probably all suck, but I'll finish them anyways.    I'm hoping to get my computer before school starts, but it probably won't happen, something always seems to get in the way.

      I don't think I've talked about me giving up pop on this Blog. It all started the day after Independence Day, July 5. I just decided that pop was bad for me and that I shouldn't drink it anymore. I haven't had a pop since that day, which is a long time for someone who used to drink 1-2 liters of pop a day. I was kind of afraid of getting headaches and such from the withdrawal from caffeine, but I didn't have any.    Sunday is usually a slow day for me so I really can't think of anything else, hopefully Monday will be more exciting.

Now that everyone hates how easy my life is, I'll move on to something else. What is up with the ilovebees.com thing and Halo 2? That is just weird, for more info, check out  urlLink Slashdot , crazy and weird is what it is.    Hope you like the revisions that I made to my blog, looks alot better now, at least in my eyes. The whole getting a computer thing is moving along slowly, as I grapple with myself over whether I want to spend my money on a computer, don't worry, the bad half of me will win in the end;)

      The Xbox is coming, the Xbox is coming! Now that I've said that four times, I still feel the need to say it a few more times, but I won't to try to keep any possibility of this post being worthwhile alive. On a different subject, I apologize for not posting yesterday, I know I said I would but became too tired and decided to go asleep instead of posting in this blog.    Still working on finding a computer, hopefully one will come up thats a good deal again. Bestbuy had one about 2 weeks back, $600 after $300 in mail in rebates and no interest for a year. It had all the Specs that I wanted but I didn't act fast enough and they sold out in a few days, before I could talk my parents into buying it(I'm 17 so I can't get the no interest for a year deal by myself, at least I don't think I can).    I'm up to around 83,000 keys in Whatpulse, I find this pretty amusing because I've only had it for about a week and a half, and I'm not a typing pro. Most of them are probably from playing the UT2004 demo, which is incredibly addicting(Onslaught rules).

I'm still working on getting a computer, I'm hoping to get one before Doom 3 comes out, so I better hurry it up. I'm looking to get something that would fit into the gaming rig for a cheap bastard category, only want to spend about $800.     <>    What I want in it   -512 Mb ram  -ATI 9800 Pro  -AMD Althon XP 3000+  -160 Gb Hard drive  -Rest doesn't really matter to me    During the last few weeks Avast was not updating enough to make me feel safe so I have switched over to  urlLink AVG Free Edition , because they seem to do a better job keeping things updated. I guess that ends my entry for the day, hopefully I'll be back tomorrow to spew even more useless information out to the people of this great world.     <><>

      Well, I had decided to just give up on having a blog at all, but since I got this  urlLink WhatPulse  program I decided that writing in a Blog would be a good place to get my key count higher. So here I am resurecting my Blog in the middle of the night, mostly because I can't get to sleep.     The Mountain Dew Xbox that I was saving up caps to get finally came available at a time when I was online, so in about 8 weeks I should have my Xbox. I'll have a month of playing Halo and then Halo 2 will come out, can't wait.    I'm going to go try to get some sleep now so I guess I'll be writing more soon, See yah later.
