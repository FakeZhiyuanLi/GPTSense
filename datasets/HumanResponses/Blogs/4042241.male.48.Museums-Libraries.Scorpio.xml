      Bodgit only managed 37 tonight... Forgot that England beat Mexico on the way to winning the 1966 World Cup. We are never any good at golfers either. Didn't know that Everton has two elephants on their shirts next season either... Saw Steve and Karen from the Robin Hood who had turned up at the pub for their night off. They said that they were too busy for a Quiz Night. I suggested that they would have difficulty due to lack of space - because although they have more physical space, they've filled it up with big leather sofa's and food tables. Not that useful for lots of teams of 4 or 6 fighting over somewhere to sit! So looks like we're stuck with the Ridgeway! We had two goes at the safe tonight, drawing 2 of our 3 raffle tickets out! But neither Alan or myself managed to crack it! Another donation of our own £5 to the Bruge Christmas Fund then! Ho Hum...

      Transport for London announced that cyclists in London were up 25% and remarkably cycling accidents were down by 8%. Not that I'm dubious about the second statistic...   Today was a first however - nearly being knocked over by a cyclist when I was on a zebra crossing coming the&nbsp;wrong way! &nbsp;I looked right to make sure no traffic was hurtling to fast towards me - all clear to get to the central island&nbsp;so I sallied forth - only to see a cyclist, coming from my left - on the wrong side of the road shave my eye brows. Head phones on&nbsp; and totally oblivious. Prat! Why was he on my side - because he didn't want to stop for the pedestrians crossing from the other side of the road as the rest of the traffic had done....  Licence cyclists and make 'em carry insurance - that's what I say!

      Last night's Evening Standard was full of letters saying how happy they had taken the plunge and moved out of London.  London is scruffy, noisy, rude and expensive. Well today, London is bustling with that laid back sort of feel.  The Victoria Line was empty.  Kings Cross was flowing reasonably traffic wise. Grays Inn Road was empty (mind you it is still only one way at the moment...) Mecklenburgh Square had groups of people smiling and laughing and conversing - it was very nearly a Lionel Bart set. I expected strawberry sellers and a big brass band to come round the corner... London in the summer, without the school morning rush - heaven. Probably back to its crappy self tomorrow...

      Anyone out there ultra pigged off that    There is a lot of crap on Channel 4 , but the best TV cop show is shown usually between the hours of midnight and one am in the morning?  We are now two seasons behind the States - a full 44 episodes!!!  There was no announcement by Channel 4 of when series 10 might appear on our screens - if ever   I think Sky should take things in hand and go for the rights for series 10 and 11.   They sorted out 24 when BBC shoved it on BBC 2 at late evening viewing. Lets get some proper people with programming sense to put the worlds best cop show into the limelight...  &nbsp;

      Is it just me?? On Sunday, Chanderpaul had only just gone out to bat when he gloved a catch to a close fielder. Everyone thought it was out, except the umpire. The slo mo showed it clearly coming off the glove and it was an obvious catch, however the umpire didn't give it. During the analysis at the end of the game, all the pundits were discussing whether or not the umpire should get to see the replay before making his decision.   Actually, that is not the point....   Chanderpaul knew he had gloved it and should have walked - not waiting for the raised finger. By not walking, surely it would be deemed as cheating?...... This was never even discussed. Mind you Geoff Boycott was a pundit...   Professionalism is such a wonderful thing. Never did Maradona any harm I suppose..

      The kid who played Jason ... I said to Linda, he's got the look of Alan Armstrong.   And what do you know, the cast list reveals....   Jason Murphy ...... Joe Armstrong   And Linda says I always say he looks like.... and it never looks like him....   I rest my case

      Just created a blog at work, but obviously can't swear or rant about things too much - so am setting up one for everyday life - as I can never be bothered with all this uploading mularky on the Internet pages you get with your accounts.   So hopefully you'll be able to see life as it comes down in the smoke and grime of Lunnon taan.   So apologies to the girls in Fulham, as the Piccadilly line was up the creek at 6 when I left work - this is why I'm doing this blog instead.   We are also looking at how many syns a Muller Rice is and I'm definitely over the limit today.   Off to see if we can fathom out Waking The Dead this week - last week was a bit too much double Irish informant for me - was a bit confused in the end. The beard has got to go Shoestring.....

      Been a strange week at work.   Lots of mundane stuff like sorting out this damn Athens Administrator Guide, which I'm still not really happy with, but it does have lots of screen dumps and hot tips, so I hope people understand it! Hopefully that will go out to the masses on Monday.  Great to have Cheryl back - it was quite funny having only just made it in to work on Monday, getting a phone call from Cheryl saying can you come and help me carry my bag in! The crutch is a little cumbersome - poor cock! Any way she's back into the swing, or half limp, with the team review. It is worrying, but a challenge does present opportunities, even with the shadow of National Library for Health lurking in the background.  Then this NLH "consultation" where no one was given much information other than it is happening and here is all the publicity. Please don't ask awkward questions - put them on post-its and and an independent company who devised the original road map for National Library for Health utopia will sort out those questions it wants to answer and ignore the rest... Cynical - me? Nah!   Funniest comment I heard was that a NeLH /NLH team member thought that the Wednesday London traunch asked "unhelpful questions" What is that??? Maybe unhelpful because they obstruct the way NLH want to go - although "we" are supposed to deciding the route through "consultation" - yeh right! Ho Hum. Looks like this one will run and run... Still leaves a lot of pissed off and unhappy people...  Ah well the weekend is upon us. Premier football starts tomorrow - with Spurs v an Owenless Liverpool. If Spurs win they could be top of the Championship for at least 2 or 3 hours! The boys are away at Dad's Man City. How long will Keegan last one asks? Come on You Whites!

      As I suspected, little discussion, this is what is going to happen, we want your input - we'll write it up. You've been consulted. Daft thing is - most of the people who voice legitimate concern on the whole are in favour of developing a national framework - just that it has been hijacked by a senior management team who think they solve it along the same lines as National Programme for IT - you do as we say because we know what's best. Again bullying tactics rather than proper consultation... Ah well, perhaps some supplier or publisher might employ me :-)

      Out on the town with Scott from National Core Content Group and Gavin from Dialog... We discussed the world and it's dog plus caught up or started as much gossip as we could on around 5 pints... The Pint Pot in Tottenham Court Road. Not a bad gaff! Cheaper than the hotel bar at Scott's hotel - The Georgian whatever near Goodge Street. £7 for 2 pints of lager and he had the cheek to tell me that it didn't include service charge. Pour the beer man, its your job! Service charge indeed.

      Blazing heat, but with a bit of a breeze.  We attacked the debris in the garden and I drove it down the dump. Which was empty. Everyone is on sodding holiday except us!  I'm trying to work out how to connect me new ASDL Wireless modem BT sent me to use with my internet telephone service. Disconnected the phone in the bedroom from the extension that doesn't work to use as my internet phone. Moving the bed created about an hours hovering and cleaning! Bonus was finding those films Linda bought for Florida under the bed!  After watching Arsenal whoop the pants off Manure in the "Community" (what happened to Charity?) Shield - Arsenal already looking too good for the the rest of us, even without Vierra ... I attacked the front garden. Liberally watering the garden which was liberally watered by the storms overnight! Jason brought Mandy in - for more than the usual 2 minutes... Very nice girl. Far to good for Jason if you ask me :-)  So bloomin hot I couldn't sleep. Ended up watching "Love Actually" on my computer after still failing miserably to install this bloody new modem... Eventually got to bed at around 2.35 am. I was soundo when everyone was woken up by the storm...  In work late Monday...

      This weekend was bloomin hot. I went over to Fulham to pick Nell's bike up from Mend a Bike. We thought it would be around £40 - it was £25 - nice one guys. Made up for being duped on Thursday!  Another pedometer salad at MaccyD's. This time the pedometer is for Linda. I gave Nell the Kelloggs one that resets itself...Too hot for walking though.  Girls were of to Trafalgar Sq for Church in the City do. We caught the 14 bus which only took 5 minutes to come this time Ken (credit where credit due) and enjoyed front seats top deck ride on a soon to be extinct Routemaster (shame!). We got off at Piccadilly. Girls went of to Trafalgar Sq (via Lush &amp; Virgin Records). I went home via tube.  Jason was dead to the world after his "sleep over" at Mandy's... No stamina that boy... Watched the Sky updates on the first day of the Coca Cola Championship, League 1 and League 2. What happened to the good old Divisions. You knew where you in them days... Scunny were always in Div 4. You could set you watch by them!  Watered the garden and watched tv keeping up fluid intake. This damned heat. When will it ever end!

      Having rushed over to Fulham, getting off at West Brompton because the Piccadilly line was having speed restrictions... I found myself rushing back into town with Nell to try and get some cheap theatre tickets for the Reduced Shakespeare Company. Initially we were going to the bicycle repairman (who didn't look like Michael Palin) and then have something to eat. By 6.30 - bicycle repairman had taken the bike off our hands.  "Do you want to go and see Shakespeare" was how Nell put it  - and, to my dying day, I will swear that added to the sentence was "because you haven't seen it yet and I like to go and see it with you.." Bat eyelids. She disputes this and said I interpreted it wrongly! Hmmmmn  Initially I was reluctant, cost, the fact that I wasn't particularly in the mood... I relented and said we'd go into town and check cheap tickets at the Leicester Sq booth. A cramped sweaty tube ride later we arrive @ the booth 5 minutes past 7. It shuts @ 7!  Leg it to the theatre. Cheapest tickets £10 with restricted view. Am strong - say no. Leave theatre for food at West End Kitchen. Resolve crumbles over much needed lamb chops. Back @ theatre 7.50. Restricted view not so bad! Then I look at the set. Tis "The Bible"! The only one I've seen! "I thought you said it was Shakespeare tonight!" "I didn't.. You assumed it and I didn't correct you!" False pretences or what! Anyway made Nell buy the half time icecream for such trickery - stem ginger mmmmn cold icecream with an unexpected hot kick.  Anyway the Bible was exellent. Simon, John and Mikey working a lively audience, many from over the pond and the Bush / Michael Jackson jokes well received. Timing of the foreskin sketch was crap which made it even funnier. The Genesis / Peter Gabriel joke way over the top of most but it cracks me up! Disaster almost struck with John as Goliath trapping his costume under the box - again one of those unintentional laughs. Girls for the Old Man Noah had an Ark looked too well rehearsed... we suspect they may have been before - especially after the fish impersonations.  After the show we went backstage... I didn't expect I could drag Nell away to catch a quick bus home... Simon came out first and chatted to us and some visiting Americans. John came out - with golf clubs - and gave Nell a lovely big hug, which made her night. The boys asked her about her mum (away in the States) and sister (Christian concert in Ealing) and John asked me about Fulham (had my Champions Polo shirt on) They have season tickets amongst the show crew and go and see them regularly. Mikey came out later and ran off with John' s golf clubs.. sold them for a tidy sum to finance a pint I gather.. They larked about in front of the cameras we all had kissed and shook manly hands and disappeared off pubward. Nice guys.  Evening slightly clouded by the non arrival of the 14 bus, 20 minutes and no show Ken! Tube back to Fulham costing me full fare for Nell (after 10.30 - the hour children magically grow into adults according to London Transport) - she's nearly there anyway but that's not the point. Eventually got home Winchmore Hill way at 12.30 ish. Knackered but happy. And I'd done over15,000 paces on the MaccyD Pedometer!!!

      I wonder if Corgi Adult and Vintage, the publishers of Dan Brown’ s “The Da Vinci Code” and Mark Haddon’s “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time” respectively appreciate the whole plot of the book being revealed by the Sun in Wednesday August 4th’s edition. Apparently they were saving you the time of reading this summers best sellers – but then again so does the Readers Digest, which usually pays publishers a bit of money to provide an edited version.  Might this be an infringement of copyright???  I'll ask them - and let you know...

      I rather foolishly upgraded my Broadband access with BT last week and three ton of equipment appeared through the post. I can now set up my own wireless network as well as telephone on the web... when I get the blooming thing working - which I had done with much success last night. So best bet is to email me at work.  If you haven't got it blog me!!!

      Naomi found my stepometer in the toilet at work (Yes we are very Ally McBeal at the office - even if it is one toilet - too much information I know!)  I had up until around 4.30 yesterday done 6363 steps - so the walk to Kings Cross and the slight jog to avoid the lightening from Southgate may not have taken me to 10,000 daily steps... but hey I'm getting there. What with all this fruit I'm eating since Linda has opened a greengrocers at our house... I shall be svelte like in no time.  Also the Fulham residence was not flooded - according to Nell.  I'm getting slightly worried because we are already in August and XE in Australia has not sent any rules for this season's footy tipping competition...

      Had just done 6,000 plus steps using me new MaccyD stepometer and it fell off me belt - unbeknownst to me!!! Shall have to have another MaccyD salad... bummer.  Awaiting the storm damage report on the Fulham house from the girls when they get back from St Matthews tonight. Around All Saints appears to be OK according to Em - but she hasn't been home since the storms...

      Just a quick one this morning.   My mum is against Sky taking on NYPD Blue because they don't have Sky - but I would video it and send it her if they did. She is also a late night Channel Four videower so she can see it at a decent time!!!  Nell took me to McDonalds lastnight - which didn't blow me red day green day diet I am tracking Linda with - as I went for the grilled chicken salad and it was brilliant - not only that - I got a pedometer! This is better than Special K pedometer, which although does more things, like translates steps into kilometres walked, the MacD pedometer has a cover so doesn't reset accidentally - which the Special K did most times (very annoying!!)  Em is on her second day of fashion design at All Saints Church
