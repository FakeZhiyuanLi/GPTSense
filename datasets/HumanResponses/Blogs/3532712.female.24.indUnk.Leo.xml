      Have you ever you ever reached a rainbow's end And did you find your pot of gold Ever catch a shooting star Tell me how high did you soar Ever felt like you were dreaming Just to find that you're awake Cause the magic that surrounds you Will lift you up and guide you on your way  I can see it in the stars across the sky Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before Now I finally realize See I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive And finally yeah  I believe in the impossible If I reach deep within my heart Overcome any obstacle Won't let this dream fall apart See I strive to be the very best Shine my light for all to see Cause anything is possible  When you believe yeah  I can see it in the stars across the sky Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before Now I finally realize I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive And finally I believe Yes I believe  Ohh Yeah  Love keeps liftin me higher Liftin me higher Love keeps liftin me higher I said love keeps liften Love keeps liften me  I said Love keeps liften  Love keeps liften me higher Said love keeps liften me higher I said love keeps liften me high   [ www.LyricsTop.com ]

      Singers come and go... though there are some who become big-named divas from being pop superstars, there are also those who are (unfortunately) one-hit wonders.  One famous song and their careers go kaput...  So what makes Fantasia Barrino different? Well, aside from enduring months of rehearsals, result shows and of course, Simon (love that guy), Fantasia for me is an ultimate entertainer.  When she comes on stage, it's like you want to be close to her... to just listen to her as she sings and allow yourself to feel.  She's such an emotional singer that you can feel her song -- even if you've never heard the song before!  She makes you listen to the words and truly understand what those words meant.  Fantasia -- she's not just a good voice.  She's a GREAT voice with a winning personality to match.  She's humble, she loves life, she's like fun personified!  She always has this big smile on her face that gets you smiling too.  When she sings un upbeat song, you'd find yourself dancing as well! She's just amazing!  Oh well, what else can I say about this great Idol?  She's just so perfect... she really deserves to win.  Till my next post... Fantasia Fanatic -- out!

      disco lights, unfumiliar faces, alcoholic drinks. know the scene? yes you're right, we all have been there, done that but guess what? the feeling afterwards are all the same - emptiness. why? after locking lips with the guy dancing in front of you, after the stonewalling, after all that's been said and done - still empty. afterall, this perception is somewhat similar to one inhaling poppers - so soothing, so light, such bliss - but almost too momentary. this my friend os when control comes in. no emotions, no attachments - that way you get the maximum amount of satisfaction in the least amount of effort.

         You are the color pink. As a beautiful and sweet human, you are everybody's favorite person. Healthy and energetic, you're often seen spreading the happines. As an unusually charming and sweet person, you're always ready to comfort people who are down. You sympathize with everyone, but not always yourself. Aside from that, you are light-hearted and cheery. And you make it your duty to make every cloud have

         	people we meet come and go, but there are a few who come and stay. when you ponder on this issue, there's only one conclusion - people in your life come for either one of three purposes; are you a reason, a season or a lifetime? people who come for a reason may become a part of your life to alleviate something, or perhaps teach you a big lesson in life. these people are the ones who will play a big role in your life. once that purpose has been fulfilled, they leave. people who come as a season will not really play a big role in your life, they may be acquaintances and friends who for no apparent reason just leave, they may be the ones who leave to another country, die a sudden death or just simply go elsewhere. but for people who stay with you until you grow old, these are people or friends you will earn for a lifetime, the ties that bind you are incomparable to any other ties. these people are not necessarily your relatives or your loved one, these people can be your best friends or friends who you've grown to love over the years. so what are you in my life? are you just a season, a reason, or a lifetime?

         a day of joy comes when we accept with all our heart and mind that we cannot always have what we want. the most disarming trait that all my gods and idols share: they have suffered great defeat; with humility, with quiet strength, with a sense of triumph. i seek to emulate my gods and idols.

      	Two winters have come to past but this Vampire has been completely allured by this Angel, some say it was a mere veneration. The story started when this Vampire first laid eyes on the Angel, the feeling was similar to one being showered with joy and happiness. For quite some time they've been exchanging glances, though they never really know each other, not personally for that matter. As time goes by this Vampire - knowing full well that the Angel can never be his, for he is a Vampire and he is and Angel, two very unique and different entities who share the same immortal qualms, has been trying to expel the feelings which has quite grown in him, this indescribable feeling of sensuality and passion is no other than love itself. This Vampire tried so hard, so hard that he tried to love other Vampires of his kind - but to no avail. Alas, at the end of the day this Vampire would cry blood, for he is alone. But this Vampire had a choice, he can leave this melancholic state if he wishes to, but his heart never would. For his heart would only choose one, after all, an entity - once loves something never gets over it, for there is no such thing as getting over something, there's only the feeling of getting used to. The Vampire can only hope and pray, that one day not necessarily in this lifetime, they will end up together. So up until this very day, not knowing each other the Vampire and the Angel would only go as far as exchanging glances, no words, no emotions, no complications. Only the presense of unspoken Love.

      How I  hate that great smile you  love and brag about.  The constant talk of  how great you are.  You think you are perfect.  How you make my life so much  miserable. You think you're  better by being in  everyone's sight... existing in everyone's world...  MY world.  But I detest you!  I don't want to  let be a symbol of any connection with you and  look like a fool, falling over you,  like other left mislead and clueless.  But I am  writing these words with hatred  in my heart. I know there's nothing  that I can say  to immediately change  your foolish ways. Even if you hurt  my feelings  with your effective vexations you wouldn't care.  You've stolen an  amount of my pride and out an  empty space no one has ever  created in my head.  Filled in my heart  are words to take you down but  you've left me speechless  and i'd rather not speak with you.  I want to thank you for  taking time out to read this letter.  Being in my life --  You're like a stain on white sheets.  I never expect to tell you this. --  You can even be my own brother for all I care,  but I  will never learn to  love you.

      one of the side effects of doing too much is developing monotone minds. we spend so much time in our work and in work-related activities that our awareness and our perceptions become narrower and narrower. we reach a point where we can't talk about anything but our work and, if truth be known we don't want to talk about anything but work. we have become dull and uninteresting. we may even find that we're bored with ourselves. this happens to those of us who work full time, and it happens to those who sit at the top of a corporation. we have taken a rainbow and compressed it into a solid, uninteresting beam of light. at this point i repeatedly chant this mantra; the tears for myself may be the prism needed to rediscover the rainbow that is me...

      what seemed an awkward situation has now become a cliché for me, it’s when couples ask you if you’re single with that “aaww poor you” look on their faces. every dawning day i’m bombarded with marketing propaganda and a flustering lore that each and every person will be condemned in the fires of hell of you do not choose to become attached. to hell with them. most people nowadays consider you an invalid if you do not have a partner, they will even dig a hole for you or put you on the hot seat, making you more vulnerable and awkward than you have ever felt in your life. that’s why I avoid social gatherings where couples dominate the scene. being singled out was never easy, but thankfully I’ve mentally moved to another echelon in life where acceptance and understanding is not only for couples. i had a great mentor, he taught me to bend down not only when you’re blessed but most especially if you’re distraught, looking at life through someone else’s eyes has made me realize that other people have more serious problems, people who have AIDS, people who have cancer, and the lot. at that point i became content with what i have, good health, financial stability and friends who i can turn to. but i know it won’t be like this, soon enough most of my single friends will find someone who’ll take their time, my health will deteriorate some day and money will be of no importance. when that day comes I can only pray with all my might that HE will ease the pain… at least for a while.

      Thank God for bloggers! Here's another article I found in my hard disk... finally, I found a place for them to be well, "published"  -----------------------------------------------------------  How much are you willing to sacrifice in a relationship? Does being married mean totally losing yourself, blurring that already blurred line that defines who you are and what you want to be?  What if your significant other doesn't seem willing to compromise? Will you give in or would you give up?  Isn't it that sacrifices as well as compromises should be done by both parties and not only by the one who is deemed "the understanding one"?  I know there's nothing wrong about being ambitious... For wanting more than what is considerably enough... But is it too much to ask to take baby steps instead... Small, slow but steady baby steps to get to whatever that ultimate goal is? And wouldn't it be better if those baby steps are taken together instead of alone?  All these questions have been crowding my head the whole week now – playing in a loop almost 24/7.   You see, I have been in the colorful-slash-chaotic world of relationships for the last six years of my 23-year existence.  I wouldn’t say I know a lot about it since I have only been in a total of two relationships.  I don’t know… Maybe it’s because I’m a late bloomer, getting into my first relationship at age 17 or I’m just plain undesirable.  But I sure am glad (and proud) that I have hit the jackpot on only my second shot.  Yes, lucky for me, I found My Forever three years ago and I could say that my search is over.  However, the irony of living a real-life fairy tale is that it truly bites.  For a relationship to really have a decent “Happy Ending”, there are a lot of witches and curses the couple has to overcome and win over.  And the sad thing about it is that sometimes, it is in the couple’s effort to build a beautiful future together that all these villains come to life.  Worst of all, these monsters are not even the people around us.  They are actually within us – borne out of our fears and insecurities.  As I approach my mid-twenties and my significant other being on it, we have been seriously thinking about doubling our efforts to save up and be able to do the things we’ve always wanted.  We’re both from an average Filipino family in terms of social status.  We don’t have parents who can back us up in starting our own business or can give us a car and a house under our names as graduation gifts.  In short, if we want to make it big, we have to work hard for it.  So from there, wacky ideas started to come up – from working on a cruise ship to migrating to Canada, all of which of course, have their own sets of pros and cons.  Say for instance, working on a cruise ship means being away from each other for at least a year, while migrating to Canada entails a lot of resources, processes and preparation.  And this is where the complication begins.  I personally can only go a week tops without my significant other.  I don’t care how much money I’ll be missing, but I just want us together in our cozy, little apartment, enjoying the usual things we do as a couple.  Call me impractical, but that’s me. But then, isn’t that being selfish of me since it means keeping the other person from doing what she feels she has to do for herself? I don’t know… that’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been having all those questions in my head!  As I go on thinking about all these, I realized that in such situations, there are no right or wrong answers, nor right or wrong decisions.  As long as both parties are willing to make their own share of sacrifices and compromises, everything would be just fine and there would be no regrets.  The key is to decide as a couple – make it “you and me against the world” instead of “you and me against each other.”  I’ve always believed that any kind of relationship is built on respect – respect for oneself, for the other person and for the relationship.  If you have that, there’s no room for selfishness.  In moments of weakness, guilt will definitely get you.    Maybe we just need to make sacrifices in order to compromise, as much as we have to compromise to make the sacrifice all worth it.  Until now, our plans are still a bit blurry but it’s ok.  I guess its all part of growing old as a couple.  And besides, I know for a fact that as long as I have My Forever with me, nothing – not even a witch or a curse nor a monster – can ruin our very own version of a “Happy Ending”…

      and i looked like this...     such innocent look, don't you think?  don't be deceived... actually, the story behind this photo is one proof of how naughty i was at such an early age!  see that wall behind me? i was actually peeling the paint off that wall when my mom came in to take my picture! that's why i looked kind of surprised -- much like a "i didn't do nothing!" smile!  and take note, that wasn't even our house! hehehe!  oh well, those were the days... when peeling paint off other people's walls was called, well... fun! :)

      life is hard.  sometimes, being optimistic can be challenging.  though you have a lot of things to be happy about, life's everyday stress just makes it hard to put on a smile 24/7.  before, when i get all stressed, all i need to do was play with my adorable feline siblings and voila! im recharged! if my fave cat, kuya is in the mood, he would even sleep beside me and i have an instant heater during cold, rainy nights.  now that im living on my own with my wife, i can't help but miss my feline siblings... ate jules, kuya taba, DJ, OJ, shammy and chubby and of course, jin.  i miss their own unique personalities and the different games i used to play with each of them.    oh well, i guess this is what they call growing up, huh? im independent, almost married and well, free but i sure am missing a lot at the same time.  good thing, i found this picture online that reminded me of the good times i had with my feline siblings...     i only wish that even though i don't get to see them much, they know how much i miss and love all of them... and that in their own feline way, they sometimes miss and think of me too...  and hopefully, i can find a way to post all their pictures here for all the world to see my beautiful feline siblings...

      Found this entry in my journal... it's something I wrote almost 3yrs ago... it was in August 4th 2001 to be exact.  It's weird how we somehow grow sensitive to life changes when our birthday's just around the corner.  Oh well, I guess that's exactly the reason why I suddenly remembered to post this in my blogger... I'd be 24 in less than two months...  ************************  I’ll be turning 21 in nine days.   Scary… I wonder how it's like when you’re 21… By that time, you really are a grown-up and you can no longer apologize for your immaturity and tell people it’s borne out of your youth.  At 21, I suppose people don’t merely hope or wish but plan and try to make things happen.  And when they plan, there’s always a Plan A and Plan B or sometimes even a Plan C.  It’s because time won’t wait for them anymore to think and come up with a back-up plan.  You have to be prepared for anything… ALWAYS.  At 21, I suppose people live on the fast lane – a kind of life wherein you should always be on your toes, otherwise the world would leave you and you’ll just find yourself lost and dumbfounded, not knowing what hit you.  At 21, I suppose you're not allowed to ask for whatever it is that you like.  It's either you make it happen and get it yourself, or deal with the fact that you can't have everything you want. When you fall in love at 21, I suppose there's no room for immaturity.  You may not always be serious, but just the same, you should be grown-up enough to take all the consequences of your actions.  If you commit a mistake at 21, you don't just apologize -- you really make up for it.  And you don't apologize because you think it's polite, but because you understand what you've said or done wrong and so you SINCERELY apologize.  Well, I suppose being 21 is weird altogether.  Some people may argue that it is at 18 marks one's transition from youth to adulthood, or that 21 is still a young age.  Well, maybe… but for me, I guess being 21 is that point in our lives wherein we really take life more seriously.  It marks our entry to "the real word" -- and signifies the beginning of our "real life."  I'll be turning 21 in nine days.  Scary…  but just the same, I'm excited.  I'm eager to embrace whatever life I'll have as 21-year-old.  I am most importantly thankful to live to see that morning when I'll be turning 21.  I may not exactly be ready, but just the same, I guess I can go through with it and then after a year, I'll just smile and look back as I remember how it was when I was 21…

      ever wonder why people get bored? is there such a thing as being "boring"?  i don't believe so.  sometimes, i think people just get tired of stuff. like it all boils down to preference.  you can be with someone who has the greatest stories to tell, and has experienced the most unbelievable adventures, yet you find yourself bored with him or her.  simply put, you're not interested with that person's tales and you just don't care about anything.  now, i think im bored... hmmm... maybe because it's 12:40AM and im at work instead of home, watching tv with my wife.  im writing this blog, which i can't say is a thing boring to do.  in fact, i find this interesting.  i can't say im alone or im in the company of losers and geeks, for im in a roomful of people and im with my good friends... yet, im bored.  see? i guess it all boils down to preference.  at this time, id rather be somewhere else and not here.  by morning, i'll be going home... will that end my boredom fit? maybe... i don't know... by then, id be home alone, all tired and sleepy, with my wife at work... would i rather be in the office? no! i don't believe so... but id rather be doing something else.  would that make me bored? i don't believe so... i guess you can't just be "bored" or "not bored"... it's more of "being bored" and "being something else", but not neccesarily "not bored"...  am i still making sense?!  maybe this whole bored thing is making me senseless... but then again, who says what is sensible and what's not? hmmm... i guess this calls for another article...

        You are green.  Perhaps one of the most balanced of all the colors.  By balanced, I mean balanced in both bad and good parts.  Let me elaborate: You're a natural, and somewhat superficial person.  You're extremely generous, but, to add to the confusion, you're frugal and stingy. You're a forgiving, but jealous person.  You're imaginative, but still logical.  At sometimes, you're a complete neat-freak, and other times, you're a total slob.  You're very stable, but undependable.  But onto the other traits that are associated with this color...  You're a stubborn person, simply put.  Do you believe in Feng Shui?  Green is closely related to the thought of having a balanced environment, you know.  When in a bad situation, you're painfully pessimistic, and when you're in a good situation, you're extremely optimistic.  A fairly outgoing and amused person, you enjoy talking to people, and hearing their thoughts on different things.  As a plus, when people hang around you, it seems like time passes by all the more quickly.    urlLink   What color are you?

      iv always wished that i could study my MA and then teach college... but work got so hectic and life has just gone expensive that studying further stopped being an option or even part of a future plan.  iv longed wished to be able to write and get published and be called a writer by profession.  but again, work got way too toxic that i barely have enough time to really sit down and think and write.  thanks to msg board in community sites that i never run out of a venue to vent.  but hell... that ain't writing for me especially if the things i get to write abt are about real people wih real problem. i know i have a lot of stories to tell and other stuff to share... they're all in here... waiting to be expressed.  iv also known that my other place is in the kitchen.  iv always loved cooking... experimenting with the weirdest ingredients.  iv never gotten used to cooking classic receipes that women have handed down from generation to generation... from great-grandmother to their daughters and their daughter's daughter.  my receipes often leave people asking, what is this??? because they sometimes look unfamiliar or when you ask what the ingredients are, you might ask, "can you possibly put those things together???"  cooking has always become my outlet.  another way for me to vent deending on my emotion.  i like cooking when im happy as i get to share my joys to others, the same way that i share a good meal.  i like cooking when im sad as it makes me forget my pain and make me remember the good things in life.  i cook when im tired and stressed because cooking for me is much like therapy... it makes me realize tht sometimes, hardwork does pay-off in the end.  just like how cooking can be so tedious yet so rewarding when you find yourself later on, all filled up and smiling... and you see others just as full and just as smiling.  now, iv come to a point where i want to share these feelings to others.  i want to cook and feed people and make them smile once they're full.  my girlfriend and i have long been planning to have our own business but we aren't much of rich kids with a lot of extra money some place.  we're just a couple of young urban professionals, struggling through real life each and everyday, trying to get away unscathed from an endless list of bills and expenses of our rather commercial and materialistic world. now, we've come up with yet another fantastic idea and i can just feel this ball of fire burning in my stomach... as if it's telling me, "this can work and this right... this is what you've been wanting... go for it!"  yet it also tells me, "how will you pull this off? no money, no background, no nothing!  this ain't gonna work!"  but i want to make this work... i want it to really happen... i want to see this pull through... we will make this work...  geez... hope this ain't another one of my wishes that'll just go down the drain or up in smokes...  hope this one does come true...

       nothing can be more painful but to learn that the person you love the most doesn't feel the same way about you at all.  it's like being betrayed by the whole world... like you don't know what happened during the last three and a half years of your life.      i know that being loved is something that you feel... something that you just know without even having to say word.  yet there are times when you long to hear those words tp confirm that it is indeed a reality and not something that you wish to be true.      it hurts to know that you're holding on to a relationship that is optional... something that the other person can live with or without... and its insanely painful to know that that person is the one you even call the love of you life.      for my 24th birthday, i made a vow to myself that i'll do everything i can to make myself a better person.  is god giving me a sign that letting go IS part of making myself a better person?  but how can i go on improving myself if the one thing and the one person that means the world to me is not even there? how i can i ever go on with my life if all i have is my pain and all i ever feel is bitterness?

        the person i hate the most is ms. frigid bitch.&nbsp; she's a major control freak who wants people to do things her way.&nbsp; she's a neat freak and expects others to be as well -- what a bully!    she's a major party pooper.&nbsp; when she's around, you should always "take care of yourself" and be "proper."&nbsp; she's like a mom who scolds her toddler for being too noisy or rowdy and for using cuss words in public places.     she's dense -- so dense, it's almost her superpower.&nbsp; she keeps on rattling about things you don't give a shit about, and tells you to shut up when it's your turn to blow-off steam.&nbsp; she doesn't give a fart about the things that are important to you -- she doesn't even sense how passionate you are about them.&nbsp; sometimes, you think she's listening, but hell, she's not!&nbsp; i doubt if she's ever capable of listening.&nbsp; oh yeah, she said she is... as long as you talk about "important" things.&nbsp; but of course, that's something that she decides.     she's so self-conscious, always thinking of what others say about her -- it's sickening.&nbsp;&nbsp; she's always analyzing how she should do or say what so as not to offend anyone.&nbsp; boohoo!!!    she always calls the shots.&nbsp; when you get into a fight with her, she decides whose fault it is and when you could kiss and make up.&nbsp; no matter how much you reach out and apologize (although the fight isn't necessarily your fault), if she's still mad, get lost!&nbsp; cry your sorry ass off, she doesn't care!&nbsp; if you're lucky and she admits to be at fault, she doesn't care if you're still mad at her.&nbsp; she'll do her usual "dog tricks" (no pun intended) to get you laughing... and voila! you're okay again.    no matter how fed up you are with her... don't even dare break up with her especially if you're not sure you mean it.&nbsp; she would never take you back.. yeah... that's how she operates.&nbsp; she's so used to being a dumper that she can turn things around as a dumpee with that  "it's your loss, not mine"  cliche crap.&nbsp; not having you around may be killing her, but being an egoistic bitch and all, she'll never admit it.&nbsp; in the event that you come crawling back and you were blessed anough to be accepted, she doesn't say it to your face but she challenges you if you can take the heat again. if eventually you come whining and complaining about her misbehaving again or whatever, she'll remind you about that fateful day you came crawling back, like it's your fault that you put yourself i this situation in the first place.    she has a way of making things always  YOUR  fault.&nbsp; it's either you did it or you allowed it to happen or you opened yourself to it or whatever -- in any case, you're responsible and you don't have any right to complain.&nbsp; oh yeah, she also decides whether what you're feeling is valid or not.&nbsp; if it's deemed invalid, you have to apologize for it.     ms. frigid bitch is a hopeless case. &nbsp; she'll never change.&nbsp; you can delude yourself that she's starting to be a little nicer, being a little less of the jerk she naturally is, but eventually you realize it's just your imagination playing a trick on you.&nbsp; she's just hopeless... i swear, she'll never change... not in this lifetime...

       another stressful work day has come! but im happier today as i sense a brighter shift coming my way...   to start off, i had a good day sleep. i woke up with a smile at the sight of the love of my life. we went on a dinner date where i ate steak, which was oh-so yummy. i bought cafe americano at starbucks... grande... enough to keep me up until what? tomorrow night's shift?! hehehe! i saw several pairs of shoes that im oh-so dying to buy (unless i die first before i can afford to buy any one of them) and to think i was never a shoe person (im more of a bag person). i saw someone from high school and was i glad to see her! she has grown prettier than she already is (can't believe that was even posible, but she did!) and i appreciate how she remained bubbly and friendly after all these years. (she actually stopped for a little chit-chat while some people, including yours truly, can only offer a simple hi-hello.) i am in the company of good friends here in the office... (god i love these people!) making it a lot easier to survive another typically stressful work day like this one.   oh well, having said that, i guess im ready to start working. :) later!

       August this year is the scariest, most tiring yet most exciting August of my 24-year existence yet. Aside from turning 24 (Read: Quarter-life crisis), I am also due for regularization on my 3-year job, work is expected to be toxic the whole month (until October, actually), and my parents (finally) volunteered to buy me my dream phone as birthday gift.   I have waaayyyy so much stuff going on in my life right now that I'm seriously having mixed emotions about the coming month. As far as the regularization is concerned, I'm torn between hoping to get it as much as I don't really care 'cause I'm starting to get tired of it anyway and have been (seriously) thinking of resigning since June. Coupled with the stress and health problems that comes with the heavy workload, leaving does seem to be a brighter option for me at this point. Oh well, at least I have the phone to be happy about....     &nbsp;   (There I go again... thinking like a 5-year old with her new toy. Well, I guess that's what you call "coping mechanism.")

       Why are some people so bitter about life that they take their bitterness on other people?   Why are there bitches who enjoy getting on a free ride, risking being called a certified slut, while at the same time take pleasure on kissing people's asses in order to be liked?   Why do attention-hungry, social-climbing, power-trippers get big breaks when equally domineering corporate sluts with well, more experience and better diction end up being their subordinates?   How do closet queens survive inside their closets until their 30's?   Why are there air heads in the world?   Why are some people so good at being annoying that it's almost their special talent?   Why are day jobs a lot less financially rewarding than shifting jobs?   What am doing here in the office at 1:42AM??? I so wanna go home... ppft...

       why do we work again? oh yeah... to live. and i thought humans only need food, water and air to survive... then again, we're not just humans.   i'll be turning 24 in what... less than a month? and frankly, i still don't get this grown-up groove. though i've long accepted this new life as an independent, self-supporting, almost-married, relatively-young urban  professional, i can't help but sometimes wish that i'm in never never land with no responsibilities whatsoever.   oh well, that's all the time i have for today to bitch about life... gotta start working!!!

         have i been cursed? why do i need to suffer such fate? i only wish to be able to express my thoughts... to relieve myself of the agony of being repressed.&nbsp; why does this have to happen each time?     &nbsp;   everyday and every night... thoughts flood my brain.&nbsp; rushing and racing&nbsp;so fast&nbsp;that even i cannot seem to keep up with it.&nbsp; i long to have the luxury of time&nbsp;to be able to sit down and write and let all my thoughts flow freely out of my already crowded little head.&nbsp; but when i do get the chance, this happens...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;i would find myself sitting in front of my computer, eager to do a hundred and one things but write! i hate myself! why do i have to let these chances pass? what if they never come again?&nbsp; why waste such good opportunity to let go? maybe because in reality, i don't want to.&nbsp; maybe because im afraid to lose these thoughts... maybe because im afraid that they'renot valid... maybe because i feel guilty for even having them.     &nbsp;   but if i don't learn to let go, when will i ever heal? when will i ever recognize my pain?

       im so pissed right now.&nbsp; i just got home from work... tired and sleepy.&nbsp; i decided to go online to relax... play a little trivia on IRC and just hang-out (not not chat).&nbsp; i joined my usual channels.&nbsp; remembering i got kicked and banned from a foreign lesbian channel, #lesbian, with most of the operators from canada, i tried to join again.&nbsp; i got in using my other script (which has a different address) and one of the ops asked for my ASL since my nick is unfamiliar.&nbsp; at this point, i was busy arranging my windows out of plain OCness and before i can do anything else, i got kicked and banned again.&nbsp; i whois'ed this other op who banned me yesterday, and went info another one of her channels to PM her.&nbsp; i explained to her&nbsp;that&nbsp;my "suspicious channels" (which was apparently the reason why i was banned yesterday) were&nbsp;actually cities here in manila, philippines.&nbsp; oh well, she was interested and just replied,  "yesterday was yesterday but today is today." &nbsp; that really pissed me off... i then&nbsp;told her...  "oh well, never mind.&nbsp; im not interested to chat on&nbsp;a lesbian channel with power-tripping ops anyways!"  then left their pathetic channel.     &nbsp;   i guess i just got pissed because i&nbsp;feel it's unfair for them to&nbsp;"judge" a person because of something they don't&nbsp;even know about! i understand they have rules like strictly no men, no sex channels, etc... but hey! you could at least PM this person you think have "suspicious channels."&nbsp; they're just pathetic.&nbsp; and i thought a foreign lesbian channel has a more friendly atmosphere since it's full of people&nbsp;from different backgrounds... then again, i was wrong.     &nbsp;   i don't want to&nbsp;discriminate those operators for being canadians... i mean, i myself loathe racists.&nbsp;&nbsp;and besides, there were some cool and friendly operators there before.&nbsp;&nbsp;it's just that i feel sorry for them for&nbsp;"power-tripping" like that.&nbsp; screw those&nbsp;pathetic bitches! grrrrrr!!!! &nbsp;

      i love technology...  being an average, 20something, filipino female with an equally average yet very challenging life, i am able to survive with so much help from technology.  i am able to regularly communicate with a lot of people, apart from those im already working with and be a responsible adult by being able to attend to bills and other important stuff in spite of my toxic sked.  i am able to satisfy my insatiable thirst for anything new and interesting, and even share these new-found knowledge with people dear to me.  most of all, technology never ceases to make me a little smarter everyday. it seems like there's always something new to learn... a new website, a new game, an entirely new concept...  it's virtually endless!  i especially like the thought that technology now is very encouraging as far as creativity is concerned... with websites like these for me to make my virtual scribbles...  with my blogger, it's as if i don't have an excuse anymore not to be able to write 'cause i don't have time!  i know my thoughts are sometimes senseless or even dumb... but what the heck! they're mine! and i sure am glad i have my own little space in cyberspace, i can call my own... to simply express these crazy, senseless thoughts of mine...

      Since I've started working in 2001, weekends stopped being my official rest days.  Working in a call center for almost three years now, I think I've experienced having most if not all possible schedules known to the center.  I've had 12-9, 8-5 -- AM/PM, 5AM-2PM, 1:30-10:30AM, etc.  I had numerous months of no social life, no night-outs, just one-hour dinner dates before my shift if I'm lucky.  There were times when I missed a whole lot of good movies and more of my favorite primetime TV shows.  I guess it takes a lot of courage and sanity to make it in a call center.  Courage, because you have to be brave to ride a commuter vehicle, specifically a PUJ or a cab at any given sked. Sanity, for there would be a lot of depressing times when you feel guilty of having to work, having to leave your wife alone at night, or you're just sick and tired of living for your job.  I experienced coming home from work, too tired to do anything else but sleep, then wake up just in time to have dinner, take a bath, dress up and fly to work.  Oftentimes, I'm thinking, why am doing this to myself?  Why this job? Is this worth everything I've missed and still missing?  Am I willing to miss more in the future?  I have been asking myself these questions for the longish time and yet I haven't found an answer... one that I can full convince myself with.  Recently, I have been fortunate to have weekend offs.  For some time now, I have been able to play badminton with family and friends, watch movies in theaters, do a whole lot of shopping, catch up on my primetime faves, and a whole lot more.  Before, I only think of spending time my significant other on dates, cuddling up, catching up... but now, I've realized that apart from my wife, my parents and my friends, there's one person who misses me most and with whom I need to catch up with the most.  And that person is ME.  Since I plunged (head-first) into the world of jobs, bills and responsibilities, it was as if I lost touch with myself -- to really know what I need and want. It was as if I just grew up and all I hear from myself now are orders and pep talks of how I should be, what I should do, what's right, what's wrong, that I'm independent now and in a very committed relationship so I shouldn't be screwing up.  But hey, I still have guilty pleasures, you know?  I like thinking "what if?" like what if I quit my job and be a bum, what if I'm single and can flirt around? Sometimes, I want to be pretty and feel pretty in spite of me being all fat.  Sometimes, I just want to be lazy and not move a muscle.  Sometimes, I like disconnecting from the world, like turn my mobile phone off and have the answering machine answer all my calls.  So now, that's what I've been doing.  I make Sundays my day.  If I feel tired, I sleep the whole day... and night.  If I wanna pamper myself, I declare my own Spa Day at home.  If I wanna pig out, I cook myself some nice meals and feast in front of the TV and have a TV marathon.  The possibilities are endless!  There's always something fun to do on Sundays.  So there, by the time I have to go to work for another stressful work week, I'm ready.  Knowing I had fun with me for at least day prepares me for another battle and also gives me something to look forward to for the next 6 days!

      I was having breakfast with a friend when I saw Angela walk past with a girl I don't know.  I remember she told me the night before that she'll be doing field work today and that she'll be with "May" -- some girl from a company they're working with.  I waved.  I was so happy to see her.  We haven't been seeing each other because of our skeds...  she works 9-5, I work 9-6... that is, 9AM-5PM and 9PM-6AM...  She just waved back and smiled.  My friend asked me where she was going, why she was even here.  She knew that Angela doesn't work around the area.  I explained she's actually working that's why she can't come in to chat.  After half an hour, I finally decided to call it a day and went home.  I texted Angela on my way home.     "Hi! Im on a cab alrdy.  It was nys seeing u.  2 bad u cant stay.  Oh well, im sure u told May dat im a friend... either dat or im ur housemate..."   As expected, she did not reply -- the whole day.  ************************  After a couple of days, I realized I'm not okay with what happened.  I admitted to myself that this is something I need to talk to her about... I can't keep this to myself like this.  So I finally asked her, "Ey! You didn't reply to my message..."  "What message?"  she asked.  "My message the other day..."   "About May?" So, she isn't that dense after all.  "Yeah...  what did you tell her?"  I saw this coming... I swear, I am actually expecting this answer... but I don't know...  "I told her you're my housemate."  "Oh, ok.. Thought so..."  And there it was... again... that weird, uncomfortable feeling inside my chest... coupled with that strange heavy feeling down your throat, like you swallowed a ball.  I think this is what they call "pain."  Yeah... I guess that's what it was..  I was hurt.  Really hurt...  I felt tears falling down... I didn't want to cry but I just did.  I guess I just can't believe it... Over three years of being almost married...  Being so in love, building our lives together... and yet, I'm referred to as her "housemate."  It's all too weird for me.  I think what bothers me is the fact that we never had this "problem" with anyone else but people from HER work.  I mean, we're both out as far as our families and friends are concerned, and I'm also out to everyone I'm working with.  The first couple of time that this happened, I was fine... But I guess if it happens all the time, it just gets into you.  A good friend once told me that there's no such thing as getting over... there's only that feeling of getting used to.  Well, in my case,  I may have gotten over the fact that Angela can't just be as out as I am but it's being called "her housemate" that I can never get used to.  Sheesh... can't she even refer to me as her best friend??? I mean, housemates don't even have to be friends... they just happen to share the same space, which they both call "their house."  I don't know... maybe I'm just over reacting...  Don't get me wrong, I do understand her... But I guess understanding something doesn't mean it cannot hurt you.  Oh well, maybe someday, when she's really out... as out as I am, maybe then I can finally be her girlfriend...  In the meantim, here I am, Angela's "housemate" loving her just the same way I've done over the years...

       my ofc is re-launching the JEP campaign. JEP... as in  Just English Please ... and it's driving everybody nuts.  don't get me wrong, i love the english language. i do believe im more creative and expressive in english than in the vernacular. but to speak the language for 9hrs???             AAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!   to date, i've heard of two versions of the JEP acronym... one is  Jast Espek Pelepeno  and the other one is  Just Espanyol Por pavor  (did i even spell that right???) and i should say that people (including yours truly) have become more speechless because of the campaign... imagine, speaking in English on carpeted areas...meaning, everywhere except for the bathroom and the pantry.  oh well, i guess we'll get over the shock eventually and hopefully get used to it in the process.

       To start off, I would like to thank my good friends,   urlLink  Jayce    and Jen for being there for me yesterday when I was so down.  Your inspiring words and sincere hugs are very much appreciated... I wouldn't have survived that work night without you! :)      And so from there, my story continues...      When I got home this morning... everything was well, normal.  We were in speaking terms, she was nice to me... i think she was even sweet.  We spent the morning reading through the transcript of the   urlLink  Charmed Season Finale    until I finally dozed off.  When I woke up, we were still, uh, normal... still in speaking terms, she was still nice... I remember she was still sweet.  She said she wanted hot chocolate so I asked her out for dinner (nothing really special, actually).  Then we took a bath, dressed up... I was starting to fell real depressed that we were, well, too normal.  I felt rather uncomfortable that we had a mean fight last night, bordering to a major break up and here we are, normal and not even talking about it.  It was just scary for me I guess.      While having dinner, I finally told her,  "I love you."   and she replied,  "I love you, too."   Being plain bitchy, I  snapped at her...  "Hmph! You love me but you were breaking up with me last night?!" Then she told me the real deal...  She was just getting back at me for some things I did and said (or should I say, did   not   say???) a few days back.  Oh well, I guess I was a victim of my own emotions and my inability to handle them well...       Rewind...       This has been going on for like a month now.  Normally, she's the one who's always  masungit  and I'm the one who's more forgiving and understanding.  But I guess with all the stress from work or perhaps I was just fed up with her, I began to be more bitchy and I would now talk back when she snaps at me for whatever reason (I usually keep quiet).  I've also become more vocal about the things I hate about her... how she's such a bully sometimes and all that.  In short, I got tired.  I started asking myself if this is really the kind of person I want to be with for the rest of my life.  As I always say, our relationship is a constant battle between Bad Girl and Control Freak... and this time, I guess Bad Girl just wants out... I was seriously considering giving up on us.  But the truth is, I CAN'T DO IT!!!  I'm too scared to even try... (do I hear clucking??? Oh well, I deserve it...) I know it's just a phase...      Then one night, we were teasing each other about the gross things we do... then she said,  "Hmph! So you want to break with me 'cause I'm disgusting?!"   And with a serious tone, I replied,  "Ok."   She asked me if I was serious and until last night, I just tell her,  "I don't know... Maybe... "  Ok, I did that not because I wanted to torture her or anything... it's just that, I'm sooooo thinking it but I know... as in, I'm  SURE  that I can  NEVER  mean it.       Ever heard about karma?  So there, she got irritated and finally told me that she doesn't need me to answer and that she's deciding for us... and of course, her  decision was for us to take the joke seriously.   Knowing how mean she could get, I was hurt because she likes doing that.  I don't know why but sometimes, breaking up seems so easy for her.  Until I had to leave for work, I was asking her what was that about... if she means that or if she was just getting back at me or whatever... but she never gave me a serious response but a shrug and an oh so sarcastic  "I don't know... Maybe..."  (TORTURE!!!!)      So there... that was how I got victimized by my own emotions and my inability to handle them... I guess in my effort not to let the negativity explode, everything just blew up on my face.  The toughest part of it all is knowing how mean she could get.  As I've said, she handles break ups reaaaallll well and that scares me.  When she's tired, she's really tired... and I've already experienced that cruelty early this year and trust me, it was really traumatic.      Well, she did apologize for making me cry... I should say that was kinda sweet.  Somehow, I also felt guilty because though she didn't say it, I guess my joke about breaking up with her did hurt her too somehow.  As the cliche goes... jokes are half meant.      So here I am at work again after our fabulous dinner... ready to battle with stress for at least one final night this week, the same way that the story of Bad Girl versus Control Freak continues... and yes, we did have that hot chocolate... and it was oh so yummy! :)
