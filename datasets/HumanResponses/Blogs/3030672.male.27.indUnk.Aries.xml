      Apparently it's  urlLink Norah Jones  birthday today. She's an Aries - just like me. I would like to think that explains why I like her  urlLink music , but it probably doesn't.

      I don't know why this day is turning out to be so bloody screwed-up.. but things are just getting crazy every second.  Some examples: 1. My two goldfish (Itchy and Scratchy) refuse to eat. This, to which any fish-owner will attest, is not normal. I'm having pessimistic thoughts about their future now - like are they going to be flushed down the Big Toilet Bowl up there - the second floor bathroom - soon?  2. My newspaper arrived wet. No car in the porch to shield the paper as it lands so this time it was open to the elements. And the elements decided to be merciless today.  3. It took me 10 minutes to get a satisfactory connection to the Internet. OK, so maybe that's not so strange. But on a day like this, it counts.  Finally, the recycling  macha . As per his usual custom, he putters up to the house on his motorbike and rings the bell. The maid goes out to let him in so he can pick up the newspapers out on the porch, do some mysterious calculations inside his head, and hand the maid the paltry sum he figures is our due. (The real mystery is why we never complain...)  Except this time, there was one difference. As I hear the gates being unlocked, I realize that I needed an article in last week's paper for some research purpose. Of course, knowing our super-efficient maid, it would have already made its way to the old newspaper pile outside - the very pile now being gingerly handled by the recycling man.   No problem, methinks. I'll just quickly go and ask him if I can retrieve that one paper.  Which I do. And he says, "Boleh.." So I'm quickly going through the pile and, luck being on my side for the first time today, I find it and pull it out. The recycling man says, "Sudah dapat?"   "Sudah.. banyak thanks-lah, boss!", I reply, and we shake hands, like we've just sealed a multi-million ringgit deal.  And he carries the pile of newspapers (seemingly effortlessly for an old man) on his shoulders and heads for his bike, where he ties the papers with string, kickstarts his bike, and with a wave, disappears down the road.  That's when I realize that, when I shook hands with him, I placed the newspaper I had picked out back on the pile - the very pile he had carried off with him into the great unknown.  OK, so it wasn't exactly the Recycling Man's fault -  but on a day like this, everything counts.

      OK, when a guy's been pushed to the brink of  urlLink madness , what does he do? He jumps. In a sudden rush of adrenaline, which I'm certain has something to do with the onset of early senility, I unplugged all the wires and cables trailing out of my TV/Astro/VCD player mutant hybrid and sat on the floor cursing every plastic piece.   But then, VOILA!   Or is it EUREKA!?  Whatever, I got this sudden inspiration. My sis had recently borrowed an LCD projector needed for her job, and it was just lying there, teasing me - "you know you want to do it.. go on!" Some quick wiring and cabling later, I had the Astro decoder hooked up to the projector along with a portable radio (for speakers  lah , I don't have the budget for a full-fledged home entertainment system  mah ), removed a painting from the wall (sadly, this left a noticeable discoloured patch on the wall, but I had no time to scout for ideal screen projection locations), switched on and prayed like hell to  urlLink Jim Caviezel , or anyone else up there who was interested in what I was doing at the time, that it works...  And boy, it sure did! It was like watching  urlLink Arsenal v Man U  on a cinema screen! And how Arsenal performed on the night! Initially, I was hoping Man U would beat them (I didn't want Liverpool to lose the record they shared for so long with Leeds) but Arsenal proved they deserved the 30-match  urlLink unbeaten streak record , and Man U were just lucky to go home with a point...   Meanwhile, Liverpool laboured to a  urlLink goalless draw  at Leicester City. 'Nuff said.

      Goddammit!! 2 hours away to one of the  urlLink biggest games  in the football calendar, and what happens?? My goddamn 29'' Sony Trinitron TV decides to throw a tantrum!! When I switch it on, it starts to switch off and on by itself, non-stop, until I get positively insane with rage and I have to switch it off permanently or else, goddammit, I'm gonna go all religious on its ass and nail it to a cross!! If you thought  urlLink Mel Gibson's movie  was violent, you ain't seen a football-deprived maniac wielding a hammer, GODDAMMIT!!!

      I received this  urlLink link  in an e-mail from a friend who, unfortunately, smokes like a chimney. Warning! If you're prone to not having an open mind or a sense of humour, you just might be offended by this  urlLink Flash animation !   urlLink http://www.dwd.hu   Make sure your speakers are switched on.

      Just saw the news on  urlLink The Star . Noted the many new name-changes and new ministers, but did not notice anything strange until I checked  urlLink Jeff Ooi's site . Well, well, well.. I did not see that coming at all.

      Saw Oprah's  urlLink 50th birthday bash  on TV today. She had guests and friends coming over like Mr and Mrs John Travolta, Mr and Mrs Schwarzennegger, Celine Dion, Tina Turner, Josh Groban singing  You Raise Me Up , Nelson Mandela phoning her to wish her Happy Birthday....  It's good to be rich and powerful, isn't it? *sigh*

      Why am I not the least bit surprised at the  urlLink events in Marseille ? Why in the world is Igor Biscan ahead of Henchoz? Why did Houllier not replace someone (preferably Murphy who wasn't having a good game at all) with a defender immediately following Biscan's dismissal? Why bring on Cheyrou instead of Diouf? Why??  In light of the UEFA Cup defeat, one thing is certain. The focus of Liverpool's season is clear. Fourth placing in the Premiership is now a must. If the defeat to Marseille is to have any silver lining, hopefully it is to concentrate the minds of the players for what we have always known is our main target this season.  urlLink Liverpool FC  must be playing Champions Leauge football next season. Anything less and Gerard Houllier will understand exactly what Roy Evans learned the  urlLink hard way  in 1998. The Reds don't exist to simply make up the numbers.

       It's my birthday, We gonna party like it's my birthday, We gonna sip Bacardi like it's my birthday....   Yup, good old  urlLink Police Day,  except there is no party, no Bacardi, nothing. Just like every year.  But that's what I always like, I guess. No fuss. No special attention. No fun.

      Well, it was coming.  urlLink PAS  were just pushing their luck too far, and instead of conquering the northern Malay heartland, they're just barely alive in Kelantan. Maybe it's the end of the extremism that has been driving PAS all these years...  urlLink Keadilan  were almost wiped out, save for  urlLink Datin Seri Wan Azizah 's seat. They're gonna need to do something quick if they don't wanna be extinct ala  urlLink Semangat 46 . Then there's good old  urlLink DAP , always there when you need some opposition. Nice to see Kit Siang and Karpal back in Parliament. I mean, really, Parliament is nothing without these guys....  OK, PM, you've got your mandate. Now time to keep your end of the bargain.

      Got up bright and early to go to my polling centre.  Had to lah, cos later this afternoon is the  urlLink F1 race , isn't it?   There was a small queue outside the school. Policemen were manning the gates and ensuring that the immediate vicinity was clear of campaign booths and vehicles.   Problem was, a few party workers (those guys who'd be sitting inside the polling rooms noting the names of people coming in to vote) arrived late, so those of us voters who were early had to sweat it out till this jokers were ready. Lucky it was morning and I was still a little sleepy. Otherwise,  mesti diorang kena lesing sekali!    The voting process itself was a breeze. In and out in less than 1 minute. For whom did I vote? Well, I can't really reveal that, can I? Let's just say that the candidate was the best person for the constituency under the current circumstances.  The result, by the way, was that the incumbent  urlLink BN  candidate trounced the  urlLink Keadilan  candidate by a big majority. The people have spoken.

      A friend of mine, AA, called me up to tell me he was clearing out his old  urlLink VHS video cassette  (remember them?) collection and wanted to know whether I wanted any of them.   Well, it's been some time now since I've actually watched anything on a video cassette. In fact, our VCR is currently stored away somewhere and, as far as I know, it probably doesn't even work anymore. Nowadays it's all VCDs and DVDs anyway. Nevertheless, I figured I'll go have a look anyway (maybe I'd find a couple of, err,  art -films, if you know what I mean).  When I got to AA's place, it was like a treasure trove of nostalgia stored on tape! There were the usual family events collection ( weddings, Chinese New Year dinners, etc. ), a lot of recordings of TV shows ( two episodes of  urlLink Manimal (!),  urlLink Mr.Belvedere (!!), several video tapes consisting entirely of  urlLink MacGyver (!!!), and many tapes of Chinese movies and dramas ), two tapes of music videos ( which used to be shown on TV in between programmes - this was during the bad old days before  urlLink MTV  and  urlLink Channel V  arrived ), an  urlLink MC Hammer  ( hah! ) music video collection, a recording of  urlLink Michael Jackson 's Ghost music video, and a whole lot more stuff. I could go on and on, but I should focus on what I consider the real gem among the whole lot.  As I was viewing the Manimal episodes on AA's VCR (the special effects used to transform  urlLink Simon MacCorkindale  into a leopard, eagle, etc were pretty good for a low budget show, come to think of it), AA asked me whether I wanted some cartoons he had. I thought he was referring to some old Tom and Jerry type cartoons, and I was about to politely decline when I turned around and saw him holding up a tape with the title - MACROSS.   I almost passed out due to the flood of old memories that washed over me that instant. As a child,  urlLink Macross  (and  urlLink Robotech , which technically is the sequel, although sometimes both series ended up being referred to as either Macross or Robotech) was one of my all-time favourite  animes  (along with  urlLink Transformers  and a series called  urlLink M.A.S.K. ). However, unlike the Transformers where the stars were the robots, Macross' main characters were human. The lead character was a guy named Rick Hunter, and the storylines were essentially centred around him, his battles with the alien invaders, and his relationships. For a young grasshopper like myself, this was my first time watching animated shows dealing with adult issues and emotions - plus of course, all those cool mechas! I actually had a toy Veritech robot-fighter way back then, although I cannot remember what eventually became of it.  I could continue blabbing about what little I remember of the Macross saga, but luckily, there's a whole lot of Macross fan-sites out there, as well as the official  urlLink Robotech  website.  Suffice to say, I came away from AA's home armed with 4 Macross video tapes. (No  art -films though. Not that I'm complaining.) While everyone will be away on holiday during the weekend, I'll be eating some chips, drinking some juice, and watching some good ole'  anime . They just don't make 'em like they used to anymore.....

      I am so freaking thirsty. I don't get it. I've been drinking so much water I should be filling up like Samy Vellu. It's 3 am. I can't see shit. Why aren't the lights working? Where's everyone? I can't hear anything except this stupid ringing noise, like I've got a telephone in my head, why isn't somebody answering the damn phone?? Lucky it wasn't one of those hand phones with ringtones so annoying you'd kill the guy who answered it. Beethoven's Last Symphony is meant for the concert halls, not on your dumb but oh-so-cool Sony Erricsson mobiles!  I gotta get to the kitchen. I need more water. Why's the floor all wet? Did someone mop the floors? Someone should have put up a sign or something, damn it! Don't they know people could die by slipping on a wet floor and banging their head on some sharp object??  Gotta be careful, don't wanna trip on the stairs on the way down, stupid double-storey houses..  It's wet everywhere! I can't walk barefoot like this, I'm definitely gonna slip.. Where's my slippers? Shit, I can't see anything! Goddamn Electricity Board! Always picking on the little guy, damn S.O.Bs...  Head's still ringing. Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop.. Wait, it stopped... no, there it is again... ring ring ring ring ring ring.......  Panadol. Panadol should do it. Lots of it. It's in the kitchen, I think. And water, gawd, I need water.  Is that the kitchen door? Yep, found the doorknob. Right, where's the cabinet, up above, on the left... there we go. Where's the Panadol? Where's the Panadol? Where's the Panadol? No Panadol. Don't nobody get headaches around here? Stupid happy people.  What the..? What's that on the floor? A log? Why people leave logs around in the middle of the kitchen, that's what I wanna know. Hang on a sec... Oh, it's not a log. It's one of them. Stupid kids. Never get in the way. How many times do I have to keep spelling it out? NEVER EVER GET IN THE WAY!!  Found the faucet. I need a cup or something, where's the cups? Where's the cups? Where's the cups? I can't see anything 3 feet in front of me, I need some light, oh screw it, I'll just scoop the water with my hands.  Aah! Refreshing. Elixir of life! Give me strength to overcome the cruel creatures of the world, people like him and his stupidly happy family, trying to show me up, that's what they do, offering assistance MY ASS!! I don't need their help, not their charity, imagine them telling me to GET HELP!! Trust no one, you idiots! Who's gonna help you now?? Who?? No one, that's who!  Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring.............  I'm thirsty again. And the floor's getting wetter. How is that even possible? I haven't even moved! Is there a leak somewhere? I don't hear water gushing, just the ringing, always the ringing......  I must get out of here. I must move it. Must move it. Move. Move. MOVE! I can't move! My legs aren't working! What's going on? One leg at a time, c'mon, you can do it, DO IT! Shit, it's not working. I'm gonna have to crawl.  Yuck! My hands just touched something on the floor. I don't know what, but it feels gross!  I can feel the wet floor.. it's so warm. Sticky too.  Have to drag myself to the door, stupid immobile legs, not easy on a wet floor, must have been hard for him and his wife too, having to crawl to the phone, stupid do-gooders....  Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring.............  Something's dripping on to my hands. Is the ceiling leaking?  It's so dark. It's even darker than before. I can't even see my hands anymore. I hope I don't bump into one of them again. That'd be disgusting. I bet they're going cold now....  My arms are weakening.... I can't support myself like this... Have to lie down for a while.. Catch my breath....  Something just moved!! Shit! Shit! Shit! I thought I finished them all off! The knife! Get the knife! Get the knife! Get the knife! Where's the knife?? It was right there in my hands.... Wait, I wasn't holding it when I came down, I remember now... Where did I...? Did I leave it stuck in her? No, I remember pulling it out... yes, I definitely pulled it out....  Nothing moving now. Must have imagined it.  I need to turn over, my face is all wet...........  AARGH! Goddammit, something just poked me in the back!! What the...?? Reach behind, must grab it, must reach.... reeeeaaach...... got it! Dammit!! How did it get there? Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out! AAARGGH!!  The knife. Stupid wet knife. He must have stuck it in there. After I thought he was dead too. Liar! Cheater! Always deceitful, even in death! Him and his stupid Sony Erricsson phone.... I have to get back up there, have to make sure he's.......  I can't hear the ringing anymore.   I can't hear anything.  I can't see anything.  Stupid short, mortal life.

       The Good.  Woke up this morning, still feeling the buzz from last night's  urlLink victory . In terms of overall play, it was a very controlled and disciplined defensive and midfield performance. The attack, unfortunately, wasn't as incisive, apart from one or two rare moments, including the decisive moment when Gerrard broke into the box only to be brought down by Neville G. Murphy made history by converting the first penalty against United at Old Trafford in a decade. Cool! Overall, a very satisfying game... "Walk on, with hope in your hearts and you'll never walk ALOOONE!!!" ( cue sound of glass breaking )   The Bad.   urlLink PPS  is down. I found myself stuck on that page, not knowing how to go about my daily blog-hopping... never realized how much I depended on PPS to keep me connected to the virtual world. Guess I have to go out now and actually meet people, face to face ( cringe! ), exchange pleasantries ( groan! ), talk about the weather... OH WAIT! I've got  urlLink Blogrolling ! I can still stay online!! Woo hoo!!   The Ugly.  Another  urlLink terrible day  in Iraq. We're approximately a month away from the official "handover-to-Iraq" deadline. I'm not confident it's gonna happen. I'm not even sure it's gonna happen until a certain  urlLink regime change  (hopefully) takes place in November. Also, in one of the most (if not THE most) secretive  urlLink nations  in the world,  urlLink news  continues to filter out, revealing the increasing devastation of what seems to be, on the surface at least, a very tragic railway accident. What worries me, though, is the initial " cuci-tangan " attitude of the government-controlled North Korean media. If not for the fact that the  urlLink Chinese media  were the ones who first broke the news, one suspects that the North Korean government would have simply swept everything under the carpet.  It's only April, and already I wish that the year would be over soon. It's becoming an increasingly ugly, ugly year.

      After reading this  urlLink blog , I logged into  urlLink Blogger  (hoping against hope), and BAM! There's the invite to sign up for  urlLink Gmail ! It says that since I'm an "active Blogger user" I can try this service out...   Now hang on a bit, I've only been using Blogger for about a couple of months, if that makes me active, well, just imagine the TENS of THOUSANDS of Bloggers out there who've been doing it for years...! Does this mean pretty much ALL Blogger users are getting invites to use Gmail? That's a lot of beta testers....  Heh, glad I hadn't migrated to  urlLink MovableType  yet... I might have missed the opportunity to be a (small) part of history...

      As I was browsing the  urlLink PPS  list of updated blogs today, I came across  urlLink this blog entry  about a puzzle. It was a logical puzzle, the kind that requires a paper and pencil and some brains. It took me about 15 or so minutes to finally solve it, although the first few minutes was spent on just trying to figure out how to tackle the problem.  The whole exercise, nevertheless, strangely reinvigorated the spagehetti-concoction that is my brain. I am reminded of my primary school days, when puzzles like this was almost a weekly obsession for me. Some friends of mine would meet up at the library during recess and we'd go through some difficult (for my age then  lah ) puzzles. Puzzles like the wolf, goat and cabbage dilemma. Although, most of the time we'd give up and sneak a peek at the answers, once in a while one of us would stumble upon the correct solution and we'd all whoop in delight, backslap each other and then get chased out of the library for making too much noise. Ahh, the good old geeky days.... All that ended when I discovered football one day, and the rest is history...  Anyway, once the initial euphoria of solving the above puzzle wore off, I started looking around the web for more of such brain teasers. Found one decent site, called  urlLink The Ultimate Puzzle Site . There's also a whole lot more puzzle sites out there, just set Google to "puzzles" and fire away.....  I also started looking around my house for puzzle books when I also discovered an old dog-eared copy of  urlLink Pierre Berloquin's  Games of Logic in a dusty corner of the family library. I was scratching my head, trying to remember when I got this book when I noticed the stamp on the inside cover. It was a book from my old primary school library! I must have borrowed it way back when and never returned it! Yikes, the late return fees must be astronomical!!  Anyway, came across this puzzle in the book, somewhat similar in style to Ted's puzzle, so since I knew how to get started now, it took me only 7 minutes (I timed myself, of course) to put this baby to sleep... which is why I can't stop grinning...:)  Think you can do better? Go ahead, wipe that grin off my face..   The Puzzle    Timothy notes that his five best friends do not know one another. To get things started he invites three of them to lunch: Adams, Brown and Carter. (The two other friends are Dickinson and Emerson.) The five first names are, in no particular order, Alex, Bob, Chip, Dave, and Elmer.  After the lunch Timothy lists the results:    Bob still does not know Brown.   Chip knows Adams.   Dave knows only one of the others.   Elmer knows three of the others.   Alex knows two of the others.   Dickinson knows only one of the others.   Emerson knows three of the others.     What is the full name of each of the five?

      Hmm, it's been a busy few days, so I feel compelled to update this blog of mine accordingly..  First up, news on the fishes. Despite  urlLink Harry's tragic death , and the subsequent  urlLink sudden addition  of many new fishes to the family, it seemed that everything was fine and peachy again in Fish City. However, it was not to be. The new boys started ganging up on the Goldfish Gang, and terrorised them so much that we had no choice but to move the Aggressors to new lodgings -  a humble fish bowl. This has turned out to be good news for the Goldfish Gang, and Itchy, Scratchy, Rocky and Sally are enjoying themselves once again. However, the lack of a common enemy for the Aggressors saw them turning against each other. The result is that Tiger and his relative, Gonzalez have been killed in action. Real  ngeri  stuff, this. For the time being meanwhile, a ceasefire of sorts seems to have been implemented, and the remaining Aggressors warily circle each other but continue to remain at fins length. For how long? The world waits with bated breath.....  In other news, we also decided to finally bite the bullet and brave the queues at the NRD (National Registration Department) and apply for the  urlLink MyKad . The original plan was to go into the KL head office, but according to the taxi driver, " sekarang mesti jam nak mampus oi! ", so the decision was made to go to the PJ office. At the PJ NRD, we joined the queue, only for my parents to be informed that senior citizens can join the fast lane. So my parents ended up zipping through the entire process in less than half an hour. Poor old young me, I had to queue up like every other schmuck and wait my turn. Darn ageists! First I had to collect a number - which turned out to be 378 - and the number being served at the time? 130. According to a chart on the wall, the 300s will probably be called after 11 am, so we decided to get a drink and some makan nearby. Went to this mamak restaurant called Mamak Fusion or something like that (good chapattis) and after a while, we headed back to the NRD. After some more patient waiting, my number was finally called, and I proceeded to the counter. There, the (very nice and pretty) lady scanned the barcode on my current IC, and after downloading the information on to her computer, she asked me to place my thumb on the small fingerprint scanning device. After scanning both my thumbprints, she asked me to proceed to the camera counter to get my mugshot. There were several camera counters, so I just waited until one became available. The man behind the counter then asked me to sit down, look in the mirror and please, lower my head (I always have a tendency to strike a benevolent emperor pose, with my face looking up and towards the right). He then asked me to adjust my specs, cause they were reflecting the light straight into the lens, but I suggested that maybe it would be better if I just removed them. So I stared (I hope) straight ahead (sans glasses), and then just like that, it was over. A slip was handed to me, and the man said "Call us back in 6 weeks to 2 months". Call you? Shouldn't you guys be the ones to call me? No wonder so many MyKads remained unclaimed.....  Meanwhile, my cousin sister and her husband dropped by for a visit. Apparently, Doc Hubby was attending a seminar in KL (they're based in JB currently) and brought wifey along (who, although is a doctor herself, was on leave). We went to have dinner at a Chinese restaurant in the Jalan Telawi area. We ordered some steamed fish,  tauhu ,  kailan , and some other stuff that I forget. We also ordered (on the recommendations of the waitress) a chicken special where the boneless meat is wrapped in pandan leaves. We figured, why not? When the dishes finally arrived, the chicken special was hugely disappointing. Each piece was wrapped completely in pandan leaves, and after unwrapping them, all we were left with was very small meat portions. It didn't taste half bad, but at their prices, I was expecting a lot more - literally. Anyway, the rest of the meal was good, and I noticed that the place seemed rather popular with the expats. Maybe I'll bring some buddies over next time to check out the " Mat Salleh " chicks...  Finally, I went to watch my FIRST movie of the year in the cineplex - the last time was when I went to catch  urlLink LOTR:ROTK . The movie, of course, is  urlLink Hellboy  (no, I'm not going to call it  urlLink Super Sapiens  - even the guy at the ticket counter referred to it as Hellboy - why the need to change the name anyway? The name was referred to constantly in the movie, so why not cut all those out if it was so objectionable?  Gila betul penapis kita kan? ) Good flick, this. Highly recommended.  urlLink Ron Perlman  was very cool as the red demon, hopefully he finally gets the recognition he deserves after toiling all these years in relative obscurity, not including the now-ancient stint as Vincent in  urlLink Beauty and the Beast . The other characters didn't get too much screen time, although Abe Sapiens (voiced by  urlLink David Hyde Pierce ) did have some very funny lines. But the undisputed star was Hellboy and the director really did a great job conveying the personality that is the demon child raised to be a protector of mankind. Can't wait for Hellboy 2....  Well, that's about it then. Gotta go and catch the EPL highlights on Astro!

      There is a phrase, commonly bandied in our mass-media, that is increasingly getting on my nerves. Everytime I hear it, I positively cringe. Seriously, my face just shrivels up and attempts to make a quick exit, leaving my head to fend for itself.  The offending phrase is " turun padang ". The English equivalent, I guess, is connecting with the grassroots. Everytime an MP is meeting with some people in his constituency, everytime he's shown on TV handling some pressing matter in his constituency, everytime he's quoted in the newspapers talking about something happening in his constituency, etc... the media refers to it as " MP turun padang ".  I haven't heard this phrase being used so extensively, if at all, before the recent General Elections. Obviously, our PM's call for all elected representatives to actively work in their constituencies, rather than just make an appearance every 5 years, is being taken to heart by some of the MPs. In other words, the PM reminded the MPs what their responsibilities have ALWAYS been - take care of your people. Yet, the way these people are been portrayed, it's as if this is a new concept to them, and having to do work in their constituencies requires them to "come down" from whatever lofty heights they've been occupying all this while.  I guess these MPs must be residing someplace really high up for them to have to come down to meet and talk to us lowly people who just happened to have voted them in in the first place...  So if I hear one more person/journalist/TV reporter say " turun padang ", there's gonna be a faceless man running around with a hatchet, I promise ya....!

      I'm actually happy, I feel guilty about it!  Ever since  urlLink Harry 'moved on' , I've had this cloud of depression hanging over my head. I keep telling myself that it's only a fish, man, get a grip!! But it's just not so easy...  But now, my parents have surprised me with a whole bunch of new fishes to join  urlLink Itchy, Scratchy, Sally and Rocky  (the goldfish formerly known as Airwolf). According to my dad, having four fish is dangerous,  sei  la... hence their decision to purchase seven - count 'em - SEVEN fish to add to our aquarium family.  Now my problem is identifying these fishes. Except for two guppies, the rest are simply unknown species. I anticipate spending a lot of time going through  urlLink fishbase.org  to sort them out...  As for their names, well, once again I've come up with a few 'suggestions', although I'm pretty sure my family is just gonna ignore them and stick to dumb names like Sweety, Angel, Goldie, etc..  yech !  I've named one of the guppies Steve -  as in Steve Guppy. He's a  urlLink Leicester City  football player. Geddit? Hmm. Apparently, neither did my parents. Whatever.  The other guppy I'm calling Blacky. No, I'm not racist. Borderline psycho pervert, maybe, but definitely not racist. It's just  the fish is black. And I'm way too lazy to think up something right now. Maybe some other day.  The smallest of the fish I've named Baby, for the fact that since her mouth is too small to catch the food pellets, we have to crush the pellets and scatter it evenly so she has a fighting chance of eating something despite being jostled around by all her 'mates'. What a baby... and so cute  laa ....!  One fella has distinctive stripes on his body, hence the name Tiger. I do not yet know his opinions on golf.  Another fish, who is incredibly fast (and has a similar shaped body to Tiger that I suspect they could be of the same species), I have christened Gonzalez. As in Speedy.  Finally, interestingly enough, we have two fishes of the same species who are so incredibly identical, I have absolutely no way of telling them apart. This reminded me of the characters Sam and Eric from the  urlLink Lord of the Flies . So Sam n' Eric it is.  There it is, then, the crowded aqua colony that has become oh so lively again. Harry may have gone, but his indomitable spirit happily lives on in the new bunch.  Okay, back to  urlLink fishbase.org ......

      Got bored with the old look - thought I'd try a new one.   However, since I wasn't exactly in a proper frame of mind (see  urlLink previous post ) to spend a lot of time designing and coding from scratch, I did the next best thing: lift a design from the Net!  I checked out  urlLink Blogskins.com , there was a lot of good designs there (for both  urlLink Blogger  and  urlLink MovableType  users) and after some browsing, found a simple design that I liked. Did some minor modifications, and the result is what you see here.  The particular design I chose was created by  urlLink May*Star . Her  urlLink journal  is a very riveting read, and I only wish  urlLink PayPal  allowed Malaysians to open an account cos I'd have liked to have made a  urlLink donation  to the cause... :(  Oh well, maybe I'll just get her a  urlLink CD  then.... :)

      Today started off well, but how sad it has turned out to be....  Woke up bright and early, unusual for a Sunday, but there was a wedding to attend! My cousin on my mom's side was getting married this afternoon at a Chinese school hall (current favourite places for Indian weddings) in Melaka.  Before we left, I decided, for some reason, to take a couple of photos of our goldfish family. Little did I know how important this decision would turn out to be.  We reached the  urlLink historical city state  around two hours after leaving KL, only to temporarily get lost while trying to decipher the map on the wedding invitation. Thanks to a passing Good Samaritan, we finally reached the wedding hall, only to find that most people had yet to arrive. Typical.  Then the festivities finally began, the priests recited their mantras (is it a pre-requisite for all Hindu priests to be fat? Do priests not know the word DIET?), the musicians played their loud wedding staples(and occasionally, the latest Tamil movie hits), and my cousin tied the knot. If you've seen one wedding, you've seen 'em all.  After we greedily consumed the veg and non-veg meals on offer, we did the rounds, met the relatives, pocketed some business cards, flashed some smiles at still-single babes, congratulated the newly-weds, took some photos, said our good-byes and left for home.  Upon returning around 3 pm, the relatively pleasant day instantly turned, well, rather unpleasant.  W, our hardworking yet occasionally panicky Indonesian maid, told us that she had noticed something odd in our aquarium around 1 pm. Apparently,  urlLink Harry , the smallest of our goldfish, had ended up getting stuck in a gap between the water filter and the bottom of the tank. The brave guy must have put up a strong struggle, but he eventually gave up the good fight and left for God's Own Aquarium.  W, meanwhile, must have gotten panicky and threw away the lifeless body down the drain in front of our house! Oh, what a terribly way to go! Down the drain and off to a sewage processing plant somewhere! Harry, how I've forsaken you!  Luckily, W regained her senses to tell us what happened. We don't blame her, of course. There isn't the slightest hint of impropriety in her track record to suggest foul play here. Still, I was upset that I did not have the chance to properly bid Harry good bye.  So let the word go forth across the land! Today, 11 th  of April, shall be known henceforth as Harry's Day! Songs will be sung, glasses will be filled, tears will be shed, Datukships will be given out (terms and conditions apply), and everyone will rejoice in one voice and acclaim the brief yet illuminating life of Harry Wakin!    Rest In Peace, Harry.

      I feel terrible. To  urlLink watch  my  urlLink team  getting ripped apart like a Proton  urlLink crashing  into a Kancil is an awful experience. I could say a lot, but I'll limit my rantings to this: We were awful. They were brilliant. We couldn't defend to save our lives. They attacked like their lives depended on it. We don't deserve to win anything in this form. They will win the Premiership in that form.  I'll just go and watch my goldfish bug the hell out of each other now - always puts a smile on my face...   On the bright side, I can now ping  urlLink PPS . I shall try to muster some enthusiasm. Ahem. Yay. Hooray. Yipee.   All right. That'll do.

      I finally came up with names for the two previously-anonymous  urlLink Wakin  goldfish. (Read  urlLink this  for the names of the others).  I have christened the smallest of them all as Harry. He was the mischievious fella who always bugged the two  urlLink Oranda , and thus reminded me of the lovably- dungu  character from " urlLink 3rd Rock From The Sun ".  Naturally, I had to give the other Wakin, who tends to follow Harry around and sometimes acts as Harry's bodyguard, a name that was in common with Harry's, and so Sally it is, after another character from the same TV show.  I should note here, though, that so far I'm the only person in my family who actually refers to these fishes by the names I've given them. Everybody else has their own names in my mind (all of them very boring, IMHO) but I'm hoping by constantly referring to them as Itchy, Scratchy, etc, I'll wear down my family's resistance and have them officially adopt my suggested monikers.  On another note, I'm glad to see the spread on today's Star about  urlLink Hellboy  a.k.a  Super Sapiens . I'm happy this movie looks like making it to our shores after all, although I won't be making any bets until it actually does open in the cinemas. After all, we've been through all  urlLink this  before, haven't we?

      AC Milan  urlLink knocked out !! This is perhaps an even greater upset than that of Chelsea  urlLink beating  Arsenal, or Real Madrid's  urlLink defeat  to Monaco. How could a team, famed for their defensive prowess, lose a 4-1 lead?   Nevertheless, one has to say, this is going to be one of the most open finals ever in Champions League football, with only one of the four semi-finalists to have actually won the European Cup before. Chelsea v Monaco and Porto v Depor will be a fiesta of attacking football, and surely the final will not be a repeat of last season's dour encounter. No penalty shootouts this time, touch wood!!  Now bring on Arsenal v Liverpool! On a week of upsets, perhaps the Reds can hammer another nail in the Gunners' season's coffin!!  On another note, it always annoys me to read speculation concerning Emile Heskey's  urlLink future . A lot of so-called Liverpool fans like to slag him off, but I'm not one of them. I like the fella, he's humble, very hard-working and consistently performs well for Liverpool and England. So he doesn't score a lot. It's a weakness, true, but give him a break, he's young and will surely improve given his strong work ethic. Managers like Martin O'Neil, Gerard Houllier, Sven-Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren all rate him highly - surely they can't ALL be wrong?

      Never get your hair cut while reading a magazine. I know lots of people like to do it, but it only works if the barber is competent, experienced and generally very good in cutting your hair without ever disturbing your reading. Otherwise, you'd end up in my situation: after about 20 minutes of being engrossed in the  urlLink latest antics  of Hollywood celebrities, I look up to realize that I've just been scalped.  How was I supposed to react to that? "Where's my hair??" "Put it back, you savage!" Serves me right for not paying attention.   But really, what I like about local barbers is that I just have to say something simple like, "Just short round the edges, a little of the top, ok?" and they'll generally do a good job. I remember when I was in England and I went for my first haircut. Took me ages to describe what I wanted! Maybe the barber/stylist fella was trying to protect himself from  urlLink lawsuits  or something...  Well, now I look like a porcupine - without the quills. I guess I better get my Nike cap and dust it down, cos I expect to be wearing it for a  very  long time.

      Last night, I set my alarm clock to wake me up at 2.30 a.m. so I can watch the  urlLink Arsenal-Chelsea Champions League match , but when the alarm went off, I just turned over and shut it off. I figured, well, it's a foregone conclusion anyway, why bother?  Damn! How I regretted that decision this morning!  What a time for Chelsea to break their losing streak to Arsenal - and at Highbury too! Just days after losing their treble dreams, Arsenal now can't even achieve a double. In fact, given their lead in the Premiership (and the unlikeliness of them relinquishing that lead, despite their now-stuttering form), the Gunners' season has pretty much lost meaning. All they have to do now is to just cruise to the finish line, pick up the Premier League trophy, and head to the nearest pub to drown their sorrows and lament on the season-that-could-have-been....  And what about Real Madrid?? Another  urlLink stunner  on a night of stunners!! Damn my lazy @$$ for wanting a few more hours of sleep!!!

      My goldfish pair, Itchy and Scratchy, are now in new accomodations. They started off in a typical goldfish bowl (which turned out to be of inferior quality, cos it cracked), were then evacuated to a clear plastic basin, and now are living it up in style in a lovely avant-garde fish tank, with lighting, water filter, oxygenator and stuff. They also now have some company! Sharing their digs are now three other goldish, one is of the  urlLink Comet  (or Swallowtails) variety, the other two are, I believe, of the  urlLink Wakin  variety. (FYI, Itchy and Scratchy are of the  urlLink Oranda  variety). I've named the Comet  Airwolf  (I know, silly name for a fish, but I can't help it, it just reminds me of that  urlLink chopper ).  I've yet to name the other two, cos I'm not quite familiar with their personalities and characteristics, although I've noticed one of the Wakin to be a mischievious sort of fella who always follows Scratchy and pushes him around. (I use the term him/her arbitrarily, cos honestly I don't know the genders of these fishes, and I don't intend to find out any time soon).

      The best  urlLink match  Liverpool have played this season by far! Beautiful flowing football, great passing and movement on and off the ball, storming performances by Stevie G, Owen, Kewell, Heskey, Riise, et al. No doubt Blackburn were awful, but at least this time Liverpool didn't let them off the hook. Better finishing from Heskey, Murphy and even Stevie G (who really deserved a goal) could have seen Liverpool post their biggest ever win in the Premiership. All in all, a real good show to takes us back to 4th. Let's keep it rolling, boys!!

      Well, the Gunners (and apparently most of the AMUB - Anti MU Brigade) were hoping they'd end United's chase for a trophy this season, and at the same time equal the Devil's own  urlLink 1999 treble triumph , but a  urlLink Paul Scholes goal  has put paid to that. It was poor defending on the Gunners part too, and the lack of a goalscoring touch in the first half (when Pires missed an abolute peach of a chance) plus the late (and therefore ineffective) appearance of Henry meant that United were never really seriously threatened today. Oh well, Liverpool overcame an FA Cup final defeat to United in 1977 and ended up winning both the League and the European Cup  urlLink that season . What are the odds against Arsenal following that achievement?

Corcoran, the Chief Learning Officer and Vice-President at  urlLink GE .  It was a good learning experience for someone like me, learning about corporate management and leadership skills, and how to handle crises as GE did after Sept 11.  I definitely have to go out and buy Jack Welch's book  urlLink Straight From the Gut  as well as find out what Six Sigma means...

      Alamak! What to do? No football on the telly tonight, so suddenly no plans for the weekend...   Hmm, let's see.. there's  urlLink F1 , but I hate that sport - it's too boring for me...  Could theoretically go out for dinner here in  urlLink Bangsar , check out the babes with their impossibly-tight clothing walking down Telawi, but need some mates to hang with, otherwise I'd look like a lonely, deranged pervert on the hunt...  Could call up some people, but most of them don't like the Bangsar atmosphere.. Me: "Why?" Friend:  "Don't like lah, so many rich people, feel like outsider"  Me: "Don't be silly" Friend:  "Ya lah, you say that cos you so rich mah.."  Me: "Bull$@*t! I can't even afford a decent pair of shoes! See the hole? Look at the hole. In my sole."  Friend:  "Wah! You poet ah?"   Hmm, how about a movie than? There's  urlLink Shrek 2 , but I wouldn't want to be caught in the Saturday-nite movie crush, so many kids too, bet they'll be wailing away in the cinema at the most inopportune times, they always do (no, I'm not exaggerating. They. Always. Wail.) There was this time when I was watching  urlLink Antz , during the scene where a human kid is using a magnifying glass to fry the ant colony soldiers, a child starts crying and wants her mommy to stop the movie! What the..?! Parents, never take kids to movies. Get a DVD player. Please. Anyway, I've already made plans to catch  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow , err, tomorrow. So what else to see? Nothing apparently, have to conserve money anyway for future glut of movies....  Wish I had a girlfriend. You know, so I can while away the time snogging her. Or more, if she was the willing kind...   urlLink Astro  sucks. Not many good movies (at least ones I haven't already seen before), and Star World is becoming soooo bad. There's this sitcom they've started showing recently,  urlLink Still Standing , a really crappy comedy. And I'm supposed to be paying an  extra  RM 5 a month for this stuff? If not for  urlLink ESPN-Star Sports , I'd be sooo through with you, Astro....  Where are the  urlLink pirates ?? Life's been so empty without you guys (damn, that sounds pathetic.)  Ah well, looks like another round of web surfing forecast for the night. At least I now have  urlLink Streamyx .  *sigh*

      Although it is sad to see a man who gave so much to the club he loves  urlLink leave , I'm sure many would agree that Gerard Houllier has gone as far as he can with  urlLink Liverpool FC . He has done wonders for the club, removing the much-maligned "Spice Boys" culture and instilling European-style discipline and dedication in the players' attitudes. Under his tutelage,  urlLink Michael Owen  has grown into a all-round striker and who'd go on to win the European Player of the Year award. (To date, I don't remember neither Henry or Nistelrooy winning that award, have they?)  urlLink Steven Gerrard  emerged from the youth team to become club captain as well as the natural choice for captaining the national team in the future (although, given David Beckham's erratic performances recently, many would wish that future is now...).  His gift lies with the developing of the ground-work, laying the foundation on which future successes can be built. His work as technical director for the French national team (after he had stepped down as national team manager following the country's failure to qualify for USA '94) was crucial in France's victories in World Cup '98 and Euro 2000. Likewise for Liverpool, the  urlLink Melwood  training ground, the  urlLink Academy  and the club culture all have been transformed by Houllier. He also ended a lean spell in trophy success. Prior to his arrival in 1998, Liverpool had won 2  cups in 8 years. Since his arrival, we've won 6 trophies. We also achieved our highest league finish since 1991 when we finished 2nd in 2002.   At any other club, this would have been magnificent achievements. At Liverpool, they are but appetizers. What the club and its supporters want, nay, crave more than anything else is the league title. And Houllier, perhaps, is not the man to bring the title to Anfield. Nevertheless, whoever does guide the Reds to the championship should know it would not have been possible without Houllier's efforts for the last 6 years.     You'll never walk alone,  monsieur  Houllier. Thanks for the memories.     How Houllier measures up to previous managers (since 1991).       Gerard Houllier  Period as manager: 1998 - 2004 Trophies: Charity Shield (2001), UEFA Super Cup (2001), League Cup (2001, 2003), FA Cup (2001), UEFA Cup (2001) League finishes: 1998-99: 7th;  1999-2000: 4th; 2000-01: 3rd; 2001-02: 2nd; 2002-03: 5th; 2003-04: 4th      Roy Evans  Period as manager: 1994 - 1998 Trophies: League Cup (1995) League finishes: 1993-94: 8th; 1994-95: 4th;  1995-96: 3rd; 1996-97: 4th; 1997-98: 3rd      Graeme Souness  Period as manager: 1991 - 1994 Trophies: FA Cup (1992) League finishes: 1990-91: 2nd;  1991-92: 6th; 1992-93: 6th

      We all know there are things that we just must do. Things that common sense informs us are vital to our well-being and the well-being of others. Things that, if we don't do them, could result in catastrophic events like being stuck in the Petronas Twin Towers when a global blizzard strikes KL. Yet.... sometimes we just can't be bothered.  Washing your hands after going to the toilet. ( Ugh .)  Visiting the dentist twice a year.  Installing a firewall ( it's free lah people!! )  Updating your antivirus software EVERYDAY.  Running a system-wide antivirus scan often.  Drinking eight glasses of water per day. ( more during hot weather. )  Spending more time with family instead of at the office.  Running ScanDisk or Defrag your hard drive once in a blue moon.  Sending your car to be serviced regularly.  Using contraceptives.  Exercising.  Switching off our mobile phones at the cinema ( or at least, switch to silent mode. )  Saying hello to that girl you like, but choosing not to and instead watch someone else arrive and sweep her off her feet.  Taking a calculated risk that you know will only benefit you, but choosing to play it safe and remain in your comfort zone and eventually see the opportunity pass you by.  Calling old friends just to say hi.  Saying THANK YOU to the waiter/taxi driver/shopkeeper/clerk etc..

         UPDATE:   Gerard Houllier and Liverpool FC have  urlLink announced  a parting of ways. So long, Gerard. Thanks for the memories, we truly wish you the best for the future.  Normally, I try not to let all the usual post-football-season speculation to get to me. Experience has shown me that most of the frenzied headlines adorning the sports pages regarding transfers and managerial changes tend to be nothing more than rumours, balderdash, bullshit.  Occasionally though, during the odd times when pretty much every single news organisation picks up and spreads the same news item, I'd start thinking, "Hmm. No smoke without fire?"   The last couple of days, there has been frenzied  urlLink speculation  regarding the fate of  urlLink Liverpool FC  manager  urlLink Gerard Houllier . Not just the tabloids, but even the  urlLink broadsheets  are saying that Houllier is about to part company with the Reds following a meeting with club chairman David Moores. Some  urlLink reports  suggest he could be gone by tomorrow.  Now, I admit I haven't been happy with the team's performance over the last 2 seasons. Ever since our Treble-Cup-winning season in 2001 followed by the success in finishing second in the Premiership (above Man Utd, even) in 2002, we have been slipping and sliding in our matches. We may have qualified for next season's Champions League qualifying round, but even the most optimistic of the supporters should be asking, "Will we get our Red butts kicked by Europe's  creme-de-la-creme ?"  So, it's natural to think that, yes, maybe Houllier's time is up. Two poor seasons, inconsistent performances from all the players (including the stars), unacceptable performances from certain players for whom exorbitant transfer fees were paid - all these seem to be enough reasons to let the man go.  But Liverpool aren't a sacking club. Amazingly, we haven't kicked a manager out to the curb since the 1950's when Don Welsh was sacked. Since then Liverpool managers have generally retired ( urlLink Shankly ,  urlLink Paisley , Fagan) or resigned (Taylor,  urlLink Dalglish , Souness, Evans). The big question now, is whether Houllier will resign or be "forced out" of the club he has supported since he was an English teacher in Merseyside during the 60's?  Now, all these talk may prove to be false, and Houllier may well end up staying for another season (his current contract ends next season). Regardless, let us take a look at the supposed contenders for the Liverpool hotseat:    urlLink Martin O'Neill    The hottest property in club management nowdays, O'Neill has a very good record of bringing success to whichever club he manages. He started his managerial career at then non-league  urlLink Wycombe Wanderers  in 1990 (after short stints at Stamford and Shepshed Charterhouse). After just 4 years, he managed to guide Wycombe into the Second Division as well as winning 2 FA Trophies and the GM Vauxhall Conference title along the way. In 1995, he was appointed manager of  urlLink Norwich City  but left after clashing with club chairman Robert Chase over money for team building. He then became manager of First Division side  urlLink Leicester City  the same year. He made an immediate impact at the small club, guiding them into the  urlLink Premiership  at the first attempt via the playoffs. By the end of his first Premiership season, O'Neill earned himself cult status at Filbert Street by winning the League Cup, beating  urlLink Middlesbrough , thereby earning a UEFA Cup spot as well. By now, he was in huge demand, but earned the respect of millions of football supporters worldwide by choosing to stay at the unfashionable club. Another League Cup victory followed in 2000.  Eventually, the call of destiny was too strong to deny. Everyone knew O'Neill was destined for greater things, and so the Northern Irishman moved up north in the summer of 2000 to Scotland to manage  urlLink Glasgow Celtic , a club that recently was, more often than not, in the shadow of its fierce cross-town rivals  urlLink Rangers . In his first season at Celtic, he won the  urlLink Scottish Premier League  title, a feat he would repeat in 2002 and 2004. The club has also won 2 Scottish Cups and 2 League Cups under his management. But his best achievements for the club has been in Europe. He took the Bhoys to the UEFA Cup final in 2003, only to lose to a "silver goal" to  urlLink FC Porto . The following season Celtic reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, but lost to  urlLink Villareal . Nevertheless, the UEFA Cup run saw them post one of their most famous victories by beating  urlLink Barcelona  at Parkhead.    urlLink Gordon Strachan    The Scot with the acerbic wit is a media favourite, and we have indeed missed his funny quips and one-liners after he resigned as  urlLink Southampton  manager midway through the recently concluded season, ostensibly to "recharge his batteries". He started his managerial career at Premiership club  urlLink Coventry City  in 1996, after concluding a very successful and trophy-laden playing career. For the next four seasons, he helped the club stave off relegation - including achieving their best ever finish in the Premiership (11th) - but the club was never really challenging for honours, given the size of the club and its budget. By the end of the 2000/01 season however, the Sky Blues finally succumbed to fate and were relegated to the First Division. In Sept 2001, Strachan left the club and was soon snapped by Southampton. Once again, he found that his immediate mission was to keep the club in the Premier League, a mission that was successfully accomplished. In 2002/03, he took the club even further, finishing eighth in the league as well as reaching the FA Cup final - where they lost to  urlLink Arsenal  - thereby securing a UEFA Cup slot as well. Midway through the 2003/04 season, Strachan announced that he would be taking a break at the end of the season when his contract expires. However, the announcement seemed to affect the team's performances, and so Strachan decided to leave earlier than expected, on February 2004.    urlLink Alan Curbishley    Curbishley's loyalty to  urlLink Charlton Athletic  is a wonder in today's cut-throat world of professional football. He played for them for about 3 seasons in the 80's and returned to the club as reserve coach in 1990. His career progression was swift, yet measured. A few months on, he had become  first team coach and by the summer of '91 was appointed joint-manager, along with Steve Gritt. He was one of the youngest managers in league football, being only 33. Charlton Athletic were in chaos at the time. Short of money, sharing a ground with West Ham while their own ground at The Valley was being renovated, they nevertheless did well in the old Second Division, nearly reaching a play-off spot. Charlton finally returned to The Valley in 1992, after having to sell some of their best players in order to fund the completion of the stadium renovation. The turning point in the club's fortunes came when a new chairman - Richard Murray - was appointed in 1995. Murray almost immediately decided to relieve Steve Gritt from his duties but kept Curbishley as sole manager. The close chairman-manager partnership that was forged then would soon be the envy of English football clubs everywhere. Curbishley took the Addicks to the play-off semi-finals in 1996, and finally won promotion to the Premier League in 1998 after beating Sunderland in the play-offs. Although the club were relegated from the Premiership after just one season in the top-flight, they roared back in style by winning the First Division title the following season. Since their return, the club has never looked like being relegated. Curbishley's ability to mould a group of players without any stars into a formidable, disciplined and effective unit has seen him being considered as the best young English manager in the game. Every season, his name crops up whenever a managerial vacancy appears, but he continues to remain loyal to the Addicks.    urlLink Rafael Benitez    Considered by many as an articulate, charming and intelligent man with a brilliant footballing brain, Benitez has become one of the most sought after coaches in European football. Possessing a degree in Physical Education, Benitez started his coaching career at the lower rungs of Spanish football with Castilla's youth team in 1986. He would go on to coach the  urlLink Real Madrid  youth team in 1989, and then coach the club's B team in the second division in 1993 till 1995, as well as assisting Real manager Vicente Del Bosque in coaching the A team. He then took the step up into management, joining clubs such as  urlLink Real Valladolid  and  urlLink Osasuna  before making his mark with Extremadura, guiding them to promotion into the First Division in his first season in charge. He achieved the same success with  urlLink Tenerife  in 2001. He then joined  urlLink Valencia  in the summer of 2001. Valencia under Benitez have been nothing less than spectacular. Considered to be a sleeping giant in Spanish football, Valencia have not only awoken, but have stormed their way to success domestically as well as in Europe. Benitez has guided the club to two Spanish league titles in 2002 and 2004, as well as to victory in the recently concluded UEFA Cup.  So is the gaffer leaving? Who'll be the one replacing him? Is there a further twist in the tale for my beloved Liverpool FC? Stay tuned.....

      From  urlLink Liverpoolfc.tv :   "The Liverpool supporters have given the team tremendous backing when it has really mattered this season and I believe they deserve tremendous praise for their efforts," claims Dalglish in this week's LFC Magazine. "They have criticised things at time this season and the phone-ins and websites has not always made pleasant reading but when the games have come around so too have the paying punters and they've given better backing than most teams' fans. There are few teams who can claim to have supporters that are as passionate as the ones who fill Anfield every other weekend."     urlLink Kenny Dalglish  rules! My all-time favourite player..

      All right, I'm exaggerating.  But I'm sitting here in a puddle of sweat.  It's too hot. Too. Frigging. Hot.  Everybody, grab the hands of the people nearest to ya, and convince them the join you in performing a rain dance.  I'd tell you how to do that, but I cannot move. No. More. Energy.

            I'm not a sore loser. Credit should always be given where it's due.  The  urlLink Gunners  have played the best football I've seen in years. They've certainly given all football fans a lot of joy with their performances - even when  urlLink Henry  scored that  urlLink brilliant goal  against Liverpool, I couldn't help but marvel at it. And to go an entire league season undefeated, well, that really is something, isn't it?  Well done Arsenal. You are indeed worthy  urlLink 2003/04 Premiership  champions!

        Saw  urlLink Troy  yesterday (Friday) evening with some friends, 5.10 pm,  urlLink TGV  KLCC. (On a related note, I heard  urlLink Maya Karin  was there to promote her  urlLink movie  later yesterday evening. Can anyone confirm this?) We somehow managed to obtain great seats (my friend R said "it's all about how you talk to the girl at the counter") and so I sat back in anticipation of being able to watch another  urlLink Gladiator -style epic.  (You can read a summary of the plot and other facts about the movie  urlLink here ).  It's safe to say that although the scale of the movie (the sets, the costumes, the number of extras) was certainly epic, the movie itself isn't. Indeed, you're more likely to leave the theatre disappointed than anything else.  The battle scenes, which are a central focus of the movie - while spectacular - does not quite reach the heart-thumping excitement experienced while watching the  urlLink Lord Of The Rings  movies. As such, some movie-goers (like myself) would probably just go  blah  and lose concentration. There is one scene that does grab your attention though, and that is the one-on-one fight between Prince Hector and Achilles. But don't expect more of the same for the remainder of the movie.  There also seemed to be too many shots of funeral pyres (it seems everytime someone dies, they have to show the whole burning ritual. It just seemed to me to take up precious time, which could have been utilised for better use.) There's also the incredibly annoying sound of the wailing woman in the soundtrack. Trust me, halfway through the movie, you'd be wishing someone would shut her up, one way or the other. Give me a heart-wrenching violin solo any day.  The performances of the main stars vary in performance. While I thought  urlLink Eric Bana's  Hector was good in his unfortunately limited role, and  urlLink Peter O'Toole's  portrayal of a King who has seen too many wars and puts too much trust in his priests is spot on (although, again, in relatively limited screen-time), the performance of the others was nothing to shout about.  urlLink Diane Kruger's  Helen didn't give the impression of the  face that launched a thousand ships , and mostly seemed to fulfill the requisite eye-candy role.  urlLink Orlando Bloom's  Prince Paris, in my opinion, came across as being a wuss. A wimp. A... well, you get the idea. Although weirdly enough, his best moment in the movie was when he reverted to being Legolas towards the end.  The power-hungry King Agamemnon was played very deviously by  urlLink Brian Cox , and for some reason reminded me of an evil version of King Theoden in LOTR.  urlLink Sean Bean  (another LOTR alumni) plays King Odysseus, the only man Achilles would listen to. Sadly, he just doesn't have enough screen-time to make an impact.  urlLink Julie Christie , who plays Achilles' mother, has only one scene, and honestly it doesn't even seem necessary. The director was obviously trying to add some backstory to Achilles' motives here, but it simply doesn't work.  But the real star of the film is  urlLink Brad Pitt's  Achilles, the legendary warrior who only wants to etch his name in immortality and has no allegiance to any king or country. He gets the most screen-time, the most lines, and the most emotional and heroic scenes than all the others. He also gets to show off his buff bod, and has a couple of sexy scenes too (with editing by our censors, of course). Speaking of which, my friend H commented that it's wierd that despite all the violence and sex, this movie was still rated 'U', while  urlLink Van Helsing  was stuck with an '18-PL'. What the hell...?  So was Brad Pitt any good? Hmm, tough to answer, this one. I would venture to say he was average. Not bad enough to warrant a bashing, but not good enough to warrant an award, me thinks. He successfully displayed an arrogance and confidence in his abilities as the world's greatest warrior, but he didn't somehow come across as totally heroic in the mould of Aragorn (yes, LOTR again. What can I say, Peter Jackson has definitely raised the bar for epics.) And then there's the Achilles' heel of the movie:  urlLink Achilles' heel . Or to be more precise, the background to Achilles' quest for immortal fame and King Agamemnon's quest to expand the Greek empire. These are key stories in the lead up to the  urlLink Trojan War , and those who have never read  urlLink Homer's  Illiad   will have no understanding of the meaning behind the events, and the Achilles' heel incident at the end will probably just go over their heads.  So for those who're looking for some background to the Trojan War before you catch the flick (and I strongly recommend you do), read  urlLink this ,  urlLink this ,  urlLink this ,  urlLink this ,  urlLink this  and/or  urlLink this . Don't worry, it won't spoil your enjoyment of the movie, since the producers have taken some creative liberties with history for this cinematic version.  In summary, I wouldn't call it a complete waste of time. As a pop-corn flick, it more than serves its purpose. For the ladies, the sight of Brad Pitt in the buff may be worth the price of admission.  (By the way, for the record, let me just say that the  urlLink Heineken  ad before the movie, which featured  urlLink Mrs Brad Pitt , was hilarious.)The battle scenes are decent enough. The acting isn't Oscar-material, but I suppose it can be overlooked. Plus, my friend H learned for the first time why malicious computer spyware/viruses that come disguised as harmless files are known as ' urlLink Trojan Horses '. Who says summer blockbusters can't be educational too?  My rating for Troy:

      In a  urlLink press statement  released yesterday, Liverpool FC announced that they're considering the two proposals made by  urlLink Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra  and millionaire Reds fan  urlLink Steve Morgan . They also state that Morgan's bid ("The Bridgemere Proposal") undervalues the club and is thus deemed unattractive. Although the statement does not explicitly say that Morgan's bid has been rejected, the  urlLink implication  is that Thaksin is now in the  urlLink driver's seat  and Morgan is going to have revise his plan if he wants his investment bid to be accepted.  The majority of Liverpool supporters (including yours truly) would prefer the club remain in the hands of Liverpudlians, but one does have to ponder the value of the Morgan bid. According to some reports, Steve Morgan has valued the club's shares at around &#163;1500, while club officials say it's nearer &#163;4000. If true, then Morgan would be purchasing the shares at one-third of their value. Some say his real motive is only to unseat David Moores and take over control of the club.  We know that Morgan and David Moores just don't get along. Although both have publicly stated that are willing to bury the hatchet, neither party can still see eye to eye on the club's future. There is also no denying that both men are strong supporters of the club, something that cannot be verified about Thaksin Shinawatra.   In an ideal world, we'd like Morgan's bid to be accepted (maybe at a higher value, eh Steve?), Moores stays on as chairman and majority shareholder with Morgan on the board as well, Martin O'Neill becomes manager, under-performing players are sold, Ronaldinho comes to Anfield, Liverpool win the treble and Man Utd and Everton get relegated. Well, we can dream, can't we?

      Liverpool FC released a  urlLink press statement  yesterday regarding news of Thailand PM Thaksin Shinawatra's  urlLink impending investment  in the club.   Liverpool FC today confirmed that it had received two indicative proposals for investment in the club. These will be presented to the Board of Directors.    A further announcement will be made in due course.  While one of the proposals is the one made by Thaksin, the other one is the  urlLink 73 million pound  cash injection bid made by Steve Morgan.  I have a strong feeling that many Merseyside-based Liverpool supporters would rather have the Morgan bid go through. Personally, I do too.   The suspense is killing me....

       Will  urlLink Thaksin Shinawatra's  money help  urlLink Liverpool FC  compete with the likes of  urlLink Man Utd ,  urlLink Arsenal  and  urlLink Chelsea ? That is the question many Liverpool supporters are asking themselves today. It has been  urlLink widely   urlLink reported  in the   urlLink news  that Thailand's Prime Minister, possibly together with other investors in a consortium, is about to invest approximately 2 billion baht or about  urlLink 60 million pounds  into the English Premier League football club in order to purchase around  urlLink 30% of the club's shares . (LFC is a privately held enterprise, unlike Man Utd, hence their shares are not traded on the  urlLink stock market .)  Although there has been no confirmation yet from Liverpool FC (the official website  urlLink states  that  "Liverpool Football Club will not be commenting on press speculation over the weekend about possible new investment in the club" ), the deluge of reports in the mass media (with pictures of Shinawatra and Liverpool CEO  urlLink Rick Parry  in a meeting) does seem to imply that the deal could be closed very soon.  All parties in this deal have a lot to gain from this investment. Liverpool, of course, need an extra injection of funds in order to not only finance the strengthening of the squad (God knows we need to), but to also finance the construction of the new stadium over at  urlLink Stanley Park . For Liverpool chairman (and majority shareholder)  urlLink David Moores , this would also be a good opportunity to quieten the rumblings coming from  urlLink Steve Morgan , the club's third largest shareholder (behind Moores and TV company  urlLink Granada ) and property tycoon. Morgan had earlier this season  urlLink tried  to get himself a seat on the board by attempting to raise his stake via a rights issue, an attempt that had been rejected by Moores and other directors. He is still considering whether to launch another bid for a rights issue to win him the seat.   For Shinawatra, on the other hand, this may well be more than  urlLink just another business deal . No doubt, his popularity among the nation's football-crazy population would soar, which is important given that his reputation had taken a beating in recent weeks concerning the  urlLink unrest in Southern Thailand .  For Thai football, the benefits are the setting up of a Thai football academy run with the assistance of LFC coaches and the revamping of the  urlLink local league , which is very unpopular among the fans (although this is in contrast to the strong popularity of the  urlLink national team  which currently is the best national football team in South-East Asia, having won the  urlLink SEA Games  gold 5 consecutive times now).  Furthermore, it has been  urlLink reported  a company formed with other Thai private investors to pump money into the club would get commercial rights to use the Liverpool brand. Yes, you read that right. Liverpool FC are about to take the step that Man Utd had  urlLink taken  a long time ago and one that many fans considered as "selling out". By turning Man Utd's club image into a global marketing brand (the dropping of the words "Football Club" from the club logo was a significant part), United had grabbed the lead in what is now a race to amass huge commercial profits from sales of products and merchandise carrying the club "brand". Liverpool, for so many years, have chosen to concentrate on the football side of business, having assumed that the club would eventually reclaim their long-lost mantle as Britain's top dog. Well, it has been 14 years since we last won the  urlLink championship , and it's certainly time for the club to review it's policies regarding marketing and profit-generating opportunities if we are going to continue to compete with Man Utd and especially Chelsea.  Speaking of Chelsea, many Liverpool supporters would definitely be wondering whether this investment deal would help us in transfer dealings the way Roman Abramovich's millions has helped Chelsea. The answer is yes and no. 60 million pounds, while certainly not small change, is nowhere near the amount of money that Abramovich has already pumped into the club (indeed, even more is expected to be given to the manager - whoever it is - during the coming summer months). However, if Liverpool do go ahead and offload some of their under-performing talents in the summer, the revenue generated from these sales together with the money from the expanding war-chest would definitely help the club to flex their financial muscles in the transfer market. Plus, unlike Man Utd, Liverpool do not need to wait for City approval to move quickly for a transfer target, hence we could conceivably see some transfer scoops made soon. Wouldn't it be great if we could do what Barcelona did with Ronaldinho and leave Fergie fuming?   But now for the negative angles. Despite  urlLink Roman Abramovich's  millions, there is no doubt his influence has been negatively felt on the playing field. The constant  urlLink speculation  concerning manager  urlLink Claudio Ranieri's  future may very well have disturbed the players' preparations for key games this season, and one wonders whether the club might end up taking a step a backward if they do get rid of Ranieri in the summer. Likewise, Liverpool supporters everywhere want to know of what influence, if any, would Thaksin Shinawatra have in the club's transfer dealings and management. Speaking from a Malaysian point of view, I am strongly against politicians getting involved in the management of football clubs. I consider it a primary reason why many of our local football teams are in such disarray. Shinawatra, in his political and business career, is no stranger to  urlLink controversy , and one can only hope that he does not bring his reputed gung-ho, cowboy-style of leadership into the Liverpool boardroom.  It is also interesting to see how many  urlLink overseas investors  are beginning to come into the English game. No doubt it has much to do with the spectacular  urlLink global success  of the Premier League, but perhaps English football fans may begin to worry that the game is being removed from the ordinary bloke on the street and into the hands of foreigners who may not quite understand the English footballing culture...   So what is my personal take on all this? The money is certainly very welcome, Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, and I wish you all the best in developing the Liverpool brand into a strong, viable commercial enterprise, but when it comes to the football side, please refrain from meddling and leave the management to the manager, thank you very much.  Here's to beating the  urlLink Magpies  and clinching  urlLink fourth place  this weekend!

      Too many thoughts racing through the brain, so I feel compelled to.. err..  bloggerize  them before I forget.   Uno.     urlLink Friends  has  urlLink finished its run  in the US and  urlLink Frasier  is to   urlLink tutup kedai   (close shop). As this  urlLink blogger  says, it's definitely the  urlLink end of an era  (for us twenty-somethings  lah ). I've been a fan of both shows since the beginning, and even when they would air reruns, I would still watch them and laugh at the jokes as if I'd never heard them before. The strength of these sitcoms undoubtedly is the very real and very strong bond between the cast members.  All of the actors on Friends and Frasier are good friends off-screen as well, and their easy chemistry translates perfectly on to the small screen. There have been many attempts to recreate this sort of chemistry in other sitcoms, but most have failed to capture the magic. I just don't know if there'll ever be another sitcom for which I would gladly sacrifice my leisure time. Time will only tell whether  urlLink Joey  can hack it on his own... (N.B. Apparently, I most resemble Chandler, "The Resident Comedian". Find out which Friends character you resemble most! Take the  urlLink Friends Compatibility Quiz! )  Slowly, all my favourite TV shows are disappearing from the screen. Started with the end of  urlLink The X-Files , recently  urlLink Buffy  ended in the US, and now my two favourite sitcoms. Boy, do I really feel old now...   Dos.   Went to see the movie  urlLink Van Helsing  yesterday evening. Venue:  urlLink TGV  KLCC. Time: 6.00 p.m. (If anyone was there and heard someone quietly uttering profanities somewhere along the fifth row from the screen, that was me. A guy was answering his phone nearby. Can you blame me?) This  urlLink blogger  gave the movie a  urlLink 1 out of 5 . I think he was too generous. I would have given it 7/8 out of 5. 1/8 for Frankenstein's monster, 1/8 for Mr. Hyde, and 5/8 for being able to sit next to a pretty girl who kept bumping my shoulder at every big noisy moment on screen (of which there was plenty). But, honestly, I should have known better. The friend who dragged me to the cinema has completely opposite notions of what a good movie is. He hated  urlLink Lord Of The Rings , enjoyed  urlLink Dumb and Dumberer , thinks  urlLink Taking Lives  was excellent, and completely doesn't get  urlLink Memento . What was I thinking?   Tres.  The  urlLink Jaring-TM Net merger  proposed in the last budget tabling has been  urlLink cancelled . Good to know common sense does rule - occasionally - in the Government.  Sitting put till the release of  urlLink Spider-Man 2 .

          Yesterday afternoon, after watching a couple of episodes of Macross  anime  on video (read  urlLink this post ), I switched over to  urlLink HBO  to pass the time. Before I knew it, I found myself engrossed in a 2002 made-for-TV film called  urlLink Door To Door . It's a true story about a man who overcame his disability to become a successful door-to-door salesman.   His name is  Bill Porter  and he was born with  urlLink cerebral palsy . His late father was a successful salesman himself, and with his mother's encouragement and loving support, Bill decided to embark on the same career path. Heeding his mother's advice ( "Patience"  and  "Persistence" ), Bill managed to secure a job as a door-to-door salesman for the  urlLink Watkins  company. The route was supposed to the the toughest sales route for the company, but Bill's simple honesty and endearing charm won over the residents. He eventually went on to win the company's Salesman of the Year Award. Sadly, his weakening health and the advent of technology made door-to-door salesmen like him obsolete. He quit his job, but realizing he missed the routine and the relationships he had developed with the residents on his route, he re-applied for his old position and was once again walking the beat and doing what he does so well.   His work was made easier with the help of an assistant, a young college undergraduate by the name of  Shelly Brady . Shelly would help him with some household chores as well as delivering orders to Bill's customers. In time, Shelly and Bill would go on to become the best of friends.  Nowadays, Bill Porter no longer walks door-to-door. Now he invites the world to come to his "door" i.e. his  urlLink website , where he continues to sell Watkins' products.   Now about the movie itself. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind, that if this film had been released as a theatrical feature, then  urlLink William H. Macy  would have won an  urlLink Oscar  for his role as Bill Porter. It was just simply, a brilliant performance. He did, however, win an  urlLink Emmy  and a  urlLink Screen Actors Guild Award  for the role. He was also nominated for a  urlLink Golden Globe  (he lost to  urlLink Albert Finney  for the  urlLink Gathering Storm ).  The movie was not intended to generate sympathy for Bill. It was supposed to be inspiring, with its message that anything is possible if you set your mind to it. Fortunately, the movie succeeded in doing just that. I challenge anyone to watch the movie and then NOT feel like going out and taking on the world. This is definitely one of my favourite inspirational movies ever.   A final word on William H. Macy. A stage-based actor, Macy is one of those actors who've made a career of playing off-beat, somewhere-under-the-radar characters. He seems chameleon-like, able to dive into any role with ease and with a great degree of realism. A shame to think he gets paid a relatively small amount for his brilliant performances, while certain wannabe-actors get paid in the high millions.

       This is based on a true story. Names, places and dates have been changed to protect the innocent, and in the case of one guy, the very stupid. Some scenes have been dramatized for that extra oomph.   Once upon a time, there lived a guy named Steve. He was a student studying for a degree. Steve was a shy sort. The kind of guy who, if invited to parties, tends to gravitate towards the punchbowl or the house DJ and just stand there either commenting on the sweetness of the drinks or bobbing his head to the rhythym of the music.  Steve was in his early twenties. He loved certain sports, but in truth couldn't play any of them even if his life depended on it. He loved being the spectator, and this didn't just apply to football or badminton or tennis or basketball. For Steve, life itself was a spectator sport.  He loved music too. With friends  (yes, he had friends, surprisingly as that may seem) , he'd be discussing the likes of  urlLink Nirvana ,  urlLink Guns N' Roses ,  urlLink Aerosmith  and  urlLink Metallica . In private though, he loved to listen to the easy stuff. Light and Easy. Like the  urlLink radio station . Why the duplicity? Simply, really. At that age, men not listening to hard rock and heavy metal were thought to be wimps. Sad, but unfortunately true.  All in all, Steve was a certifiable, card-carrying citizen of  urlLink Nerd Nation .  Which is why Steve didn't have a girlfriend. Not that he didn't want to enjoy the company of a good woman, but Steve was realistic enough to expect that a good woman was unlikely to enjoy his company. So he never even picked up a girl. Never flirted. Never tried.  At least, that was the case until one fine May morning.  It was the start of a new semester, and students were filing into the lecture hall. Steve looked around and knew, of course, that the room will never be this full again for the rest of the semester. He walked towards the end of the hall, because that's where people who want to be anonymous go. He found a good seat, behind a short girl, so he could peer over her to see the whiteboard. The seat was the first one of the row, next to the aisle. This would allow him, in an emergency like a fire or a Nature Call, to quickly make an exit without having to step on anyone's toes. No one was sitting with him, so he could put his backpack and files on the seat on his right. He took out his notepad and his standard Kilometrico black pen, and began scribbling notes as the lecture started.  5 minutes later, his life would turn upside-down.   Next:  urlLink Vol II

         UPDATE  : That's it. I've exhausted all my existing invites. If I get more invites to give away in the future, I'll be sure to post it here as well. Cheers!  I have approximately another 8 invites to give away.  Please e-mail me with your full name to  iwantgmail [at] sashiweb [dot] com  to get them. First-come, first-serve.  Or drop a comment below - again with full name and your e-mail address.  Bye bye England... Go Czech Republic! :D

             urlLink Vidu Creator    Well, OK. This isn't quite how I actually, physically resemble. But it's how I feel I look like... OK, that was a load of clap-trap too.   Anyway, here's the  urlLink link  to the avatar-generation site. One problem though, the site's in German.  But don't worry, you can find simple instructions in English at  urlLink this site .

         UPDATE 2:   Gah! Gmail's giving out more invitations! That's it!!! Anyone wants a Gmail account, drop me a mail at IWantGmail [AT] sashiweb [DOT] com or in the comment box below. First-come, first serve! Help me get rid of these invites!!     UPDATE 1:   Apparently some people are experiencing some server-error problems when trying to sign up for the Gmail account via invites. Rest assured, the invites are still valid and if you don't succeed the first time, just try again later. If you still are not able to sign up after about 24 hours, drop me an e-mail. Cheers!  ( Title above adapted from Douglas Adam's  urlLink So Long and Thanks for All The Fish , the fourth book in the  urlLink Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  "trilogy". Just in case you had a feeling of deja-vu. )  First of all, to those people who tried their hand at the  urlLink caption-writing , I wish I could extend an invite to all of you. But hey, if you weren't successful here, fret not! There are a whole bunch of bloggers and others who're giving away invites for free, and of course, eventually  urlLink Gmail  will be opened up to the public too.   For starters, you might wanna pay a visit to  urlLink LcF ,  urlLink David ,  urlLink Squall ,  urlLink Abby ,  urlLink Shutterbug ,  urlLink Oliviasy ,  urlLink Meesh ,  urlLink Ash ,    urlLink Sara , etc....  Also, if you thought your caption was very funny and merited an invite but I didn't send you one, well, by all means go ahead and blame me. I do have a skewed sense of humour, for which I blame British television.  Anyways, here are the selected recipients of the Gmail invites:   Picture A [The Day After Tomorrow]   "Come here you guys. You won't believe what these polar bears are doing!"  -  Joshua    Picture B [CSI]   "See, I have ten right here. Pass me the scissors and get ready for overtime tonight."  -   urlLink David     Picture C [Vinnie & Gazza]   "..and they blamed Gazza's loss of form on booze and drugs. If only they knew. Ouch!"  -   fantome    The three winners were selected in consultation with an independent, expert panel of judges, all of whom were completely and uncannily unlike Simon Cowell. So take a bow,  urlLink Ash ,  urlLink Sara  and  urlLink Zsarina !  To the others -  Michael ,  William ,  Calvin , and   ribsaj   - thanks for participating! And I do hope you guys get your Gmail accounts eventually too! :)  That's it for me. No more invites to give out (for now), and if for some reason  urlLink Google  chooses to torment me again with more invites, I'll just give them out for free on a first-come, first-serve basis. No contests, no gimmicks, no bribery... well, maybe the last one still can  lah .... >:)

      It was 2.45 a.m. Having had to stay up to work on some leftover stuff, I got to bed at approximately 12 a.m. midnight. (I had already decided not to watch the Czech Rep - Latvia match, since unfortunately living in this time zone means one match per morning for me.)  I had set the alarm for 2.45 a.m. because I'd learned by now that when the TV schedules say the match is to be telecast at 2.30 a.m., they include the now predictable, mindless, 15-minute banter between the studio pundits. Now, let me say I'm a fan of  urlLink Shebby , but he's at his element in a less formal, unscripted setting like in the  urlLink ESPN-Star  studios. Here, for  urlLink TV3 , he seems restrained although I still think his observations tend to be more accurate than the others in the studio who seem to merely parrot opinions found in newspapers, sports magazines and other sources.   urlLink Continue reading "Holland v Germany - Watching with bloodshot eyes"

        UPDATE : Given sluggish responses, and my own total laziness, I am revising the deadline to tonight,   June 17, 11.59 pm   (Malaysian time). Yes, I can be a real a-hole at times... muahahahah!    First of all, the winner of  urlLink The Great Gmail Invite Giveaway  is  Fuad , an  urlLink Aston Villa  supporter currently working overseas but will be back in KL soon. Congratulations, Fuad!  *applause*   The answer to the puzzle is this: Sam = Physio Mark = Manager Mike = Coach  Fuad suggested  urlLink Scott Speedman  ( urlLink Underworld )to play Superman. Whether or not I agree with Fuad is irrelevant, what I like about this choice is that unlike  other people who e-mailed me, this was the only non-mainstream-A-list-Hollywood-name that was submitted. So for that alone (and for the fact that Fuad was very polite in his e-mail - no " gimme my gmail, dammit! " stuff from him), Fuad gets the invite.  However, now I'm in the mood to be more generous. Last night's match between  urlLink England v France  has got me buzzing to a degree I haven't felt since South Korea defeated Italy in the last World Cup. I am now giving away another  TWO   urlLink Gmail  invites! (That's  II  in Roman numerals, just to emphasize the Big-Dealness of this.)  To get this invite (one invite per person only), please do ONE of these:   1. Send in a picture of yourself in the funniest, wackiest, stupidest pose you can think of. The one that gets me laughing so hard till my eyes start watering will win an invite.  2. Send me the funniest poems/haikus/limericks that you know. Again, anything that tickles my funny-bones the most wins.  3. Please explain why I should become your personal deity.  4. Predict the outcome of any of the upcoming football matches in  urlLink Euro 2004 . Only predictions made BEFORE the match is played will be considered. Ahem. The more accurate the prediction, the likelier your chances of winning.  5. Send me money via the  urlLink Paypal  link on the sidebar.  6.  Belanja  me  makan .  7. Suggest anything else that you're willing to do to get the invite. I promise I'll be fair and considerate in reviewing your suggestions.  Deadline is   Thursday, 17th of June  . So if you really want the 1GB storage space, friendly-user-interface, quick-searching-and-sorting, non-intrusive-text-ads experience that is Gmail, you know what to do.    Note : You can use the comments section below, or you can just send an e-mail to  i want gmail [at] sashiweb [dot] com .  (Remove spaces from address.)

         This young man here made his  urlLink grand entrance  yesterday afternoon, weighing in at a cool 3.5 kg.

      Well, it  would  have been the  Great   urlLink Gmail  Giveaway if not for the fact that  urlLink sixthseal.com  got there first. As it is, it's more like the  No Big Deal  Gmail Giveaway now...  Nevertheless, if you are unlucky enough NOT to be able to "apply" for Huai Bin's lil' contest over at  urlLink sixthseal.com , fear not for you still have a chance here.  First of all, let me just explain why I'm doing this.  Now, in one of my less-than-completely-rational moments, I ended up blurting out the fact that I have an invite to give away on another  urlLink blog .  Checking my Gmail inbox yesterday, I discovered 23 (that's TWENTY-THREE) e-mails from all sorts of people, few of them bloggers, most of them total strangers, all of them wanting one thing - a Gmail account.  Now I decided I was gonna be fair on this. First, I contacted friends. No takers. Then I sent out mass-mails to many people. Not interested. Hey, your loss lah people...  So now I'm left to open this to the world. Ideally, I'd prefer someone who doesn't have a Gmail account to get this invite, but of course there is absolutely no way I can find out for sure. (Maybe there is, but I sure as hell don't know about it.)  So here's what I'm gonna do: I'm going to post here a puzzle [and a tie-breaker]. Give the correct solution to the puzzle and answer the tie-breaker satisfactorily and you can walk away with a brand spanking new Gmail invite - just for you....   The Puzzle:   Mike, Mark and Sam are, not necessarily in that order, the coach, manager, and physiotherapist of a football club.  The physio, a bachelor, is the shortest of the three men.  Mike, who is Mark's son-in-law, is taller than the manager.  Who has what job?    Tie-breaker Question   Who, in your opinion, should play the part of Superman/Clark Kent in the upcoming planned movie? And why?   Those who don't want or need Gmail accounts are welcome to post their answers as well. Indeed, you can even answer on behalf of friends who don't read blogs and are therefore condemned to a life of mediocrity, shallowness and eternal ignorance.  If you're not interested in exercising your mind at all, there is another alternative. See the  urlLink PayPal  link on the sidebar? Under the heading "Donations"? Use it.  The deadline for answers is   11.59 pm Sunday, 13th of June 2004  [Note revised deadline] . This will allow me to review the answers, decide who gets the invite and still be just in time to watch  urlLink Euro 2004  matches.    Note  : Obviously, you'll have to include your valid e-mail address in your answers. I recommend that you post your answers by e-mailing them to me [see e-mail link on sidebar]. Although I should mention that I'll post the really interesting e-mail answers in my blog (anonymously, of course).. ;)  Happy Puzzling!

      Yesterday (Friday) night was a relatively long night (well, for me at least)...  It started when I was watching  urlLink Cheers  on  urlLink Star World  (it was around 6.40 pm). My cellphone started singing the theme tune from  urlLink The Godfather . Ahh, it was my friend H.   H : "Dude, wanna see movie today? Day After Tomorrow.."  Me : "Gila ke, where can get tickets now?"  H : "I have a theory, since Harry Potter come out already, maybe all the crowds go see that movie..?"  Me : "I doubt it."  H : "Why you so pessismistic?"  Me : "Cos it's the way things are. Life sucks."  H : "OK, we try first KLCC. If cannot get there, we'll try Megamall."  Me : "You really wanna go lah?"  H : "Come on, man."  Me : "I have a bad feeling about this..."  H : "Dinner's on me."  Me : "See ya in half an hour".  An hour later, I arrived at the  urlLink KLCC TGV  cinemas. Needless to say, ( yet notice I'm saying it anyway? ) the line was long. AND  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  (henceforth known as Lusa) was sold out. So was  urlLink Shrek 2  and  urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . When H finally arrived, I said, "Don't wanna say I told you so, but I told you so."  It was after 8 pm by now. We then left for  urlLink Mid Valley  hoping for better luck there, although deep down I knew it was a lost cause. Of course I couldn't say anything since I was still counting on a free dinner.  At the Megamall, my friend decided to wait outside with the car while I spend some time aging at the ticket counter. While the line crept forward slowly, I kept an eye on all the monitors displaying the ticket availability status of the various movies.   Available  - Just a handful of tickets left.  Selling Fast . - No tickets left. Unless someone who's booked it doesn't collect.  Sold Out . - No chance. Go away.  By the time I reached the counter window, pretty much every screening of Lusa for the day was sold out, except for the midnight show.  Me : "2 tickets for The Day After Tomorrow. 12.30 am."  Counter guy : "There's 2 seats available at the very front. Left aisle."  Me : "The very front?"  Counter person : "The very front."  Me : "Alamak. * tries to convey severe displeasure of having to sit at the very front * Can I buy tickets for tomorrow then?"  Counter monkey : "You'll have to go to that queue. * points to the impossibly-long queue nearby *"  Me : "Screw it. I'll take this tickets then.. * grumble *"  Counter amoeba : "That'll be RM 22. * tries not to look at my shocked face as I hand over the cash * Thank you sir. Enjoy the movie."  I collected my tickets, scanned the tickets very carefully to check for possible reasons why they charged an extra ringgit per ticket and rationalized that it was probably cos they're just greedy little devils.  So then H and I zoomed down to Jalan Telawi for dinner. If you don't already know, Friday nights in  urlLink Bangsar Baru  are very interesting - if you're in the mood for some "bird-watching". After parking next to the  urlLink Maybank  branch (we got a lucky break, we arrived just as a car was leaving), we got out and checked the area (i.e. ogled the girls). My suggestion was to have dinner either at Devi's Corner, Lotus or Nirwana (all located along the same stretch). But H had different ideas. All of a sudden, he suggests  urlLink Burger King . The cheapskate in me was about to argue against it when I remembered he was buying. So Burger King it was. We entered the fast-food joint and I wondered why, despite the hustle and bustle outside, this place was practically deserted? (See, I hadn't been to Burger King in years, the reason which I hope will become clear shortly). We came up to the counter, and I practically choked as I saw the prices on the menus on the walls. H, now that he too realized the folly of his impetuous idea yet unable to escape in fear of losing face, gamely ordered a couple of set meals (I asked for a small fish burger, being in a kind mood that night), and soft drinks. After almost emptying his wallet, we went upstairs in order to have a better view of the street. (Actually, I suspect H wanted to be able to look down into women's cleavages.) The top floor was empty, and save for  urlLink MTV  being shown on a TV monitor, there was no sign of life. We had our meal, and after spending a few more minutes discussing the babes walking down the street below, we left.  At this juncture, I should point out something about H. Now, I have been fortunate enough to have been in a serious relationship or two in the past, but H has never had a girlfriend at all. I know this 'cos he keeps telling me all the time. He also asks me for help to find him a girlfriend. I've told him he can find plenty of girlfriends in  urlLink Bukit Bintang . He could even change girlfriends every hour. He said he didn't want those kind of girls, he wanted "family" girls. I pointed out the Bukit Bintang girls were family girls too, they too have mothers and fathers, some of them even have husbands and children. But apparently I failed to convince him. So anyway, H was saying he was feeling restless. The time was about half-past-10. We still had plenty of time to kill before the movie, so H suggested we check out  urlLink Petaling Street  for some VCDs. I knew what kind of VCDs he really wanted, but decided to keep my counsel to myself.  So now, we zoomed down to Petaling Street. (Notice I keep saying "zoom". That's cos H doesn't know the meaning of the phrase "Defensive Driving". There're only 2 gears worth anything at all, in H's estimation. Fourth gear and fifth gear. Third gear if you absolutely have to. I hope my insurance company is not reading this, or else they might start charging me higher premiums.)  At PS, we parked down the road (with the assistance of a drunken man who acted as if he owned the whole road) and walked into the chaos. We immediately came upon a stall selling VCDs, DVDs and software. My eyes were instantly attracted to the  urlLink Kill Bill  covers, and I asked him the price. "RM 8", he said. I told him I wanted both volumes. He dilligently noted down my request on a piece of paper as I checked my wallet. BLAST! I was short of cash. Completely forgot about it too, otherwise I'd have withdrawn some money at the Maybank ATM in Bangsar. H had already gone off somewhere, so I sheepishly asked the trader to "give discount lah. 2 for RM 10."   VCD Pirate : "No, no, I give you RM14 for 2."  Me : "But I don't have the money."  VCD Pirate : "I cannot help you lah boss. Business slow today."  Me : "* showing him my wallet with the single tenner note * I'm not joking. Got 10 only."  Pirate : "OK lah, I give you  Kew Bew  1 for RM 7.  Kew Bew  2 you come back tomorrow lah, I give you discount tomorrow."  Me : "Huh?"  Pirate :  *proceeds to ignore me*   Me : "OK, OK, Kill Bill 1. RM 7 ah?"  Pirate : "OK. Please wait for while, ok? * disappears for 5 minutes, then returns with VCD * OK, boss,  Kew Bew ."  Me : * I hand over the money, collect the VCD and walk away knowing I need to brush up on my bargaining skills. *  When I met up with H later, he was deeply engrossed in a conversation with a short, devious looking fellow. As I  eavesdropped, I realized H was bargaining for some porn VCDs. The price was randomly being adjusted from RM25 to RM70, until H decided to break off negotiations and walked away, with Shorty yelling abuse at his back. I asked him, what kind of porno would cost up to RM70? He told me Shorty offered some VCDs purportedly of some Datin getting it on, as well as a porn VCD of Noritta. Yes, you read that right. The very same  urlLink Noritta Samsudin  who was murdered and whose murder trial is currently underway. Now, I don't know Noritta personally, but surely this was a fake. Sadly, H is the gullible type. He believed it hook, line and sinker. Also, all the  urlLink salacious stories  regarding Noritta's lifestyle as has been appearing in the papers have only reinforced his belief. By now, H was determined to buy this VCD. All that matters was finding a better price somewhere else.  We walked down the stretch of stalls lining the street, coming across several VCD stalls. Near the end of the road, we passed by a guy who came up to us and said, "Porno, bang?" Ahh, direct selling at its best. He produced a list of porn VCDs, including the above mentioned Datin and Noritta titles. (There were also titles like " urlLink Ning Baizura ", " urlLink Erra Fazira " and "University Students". Hmmm.) To cut a long story short, H bargained the price down to 20 bucks for the Noritta and Datin VCDs. Once negotiations were settled, he opened his wallet and discovered just as I did in my wallet, a ten-ringgit note. (I bet he was cursing himself now for suggesting  makan  at Burger King.) Which meant he could now only afford one VCD. I decided to use my influence at this point and suggested the Noritta VCD sounds like a scam, better just get the Datin VCD. By now, it was nearly midnight, the stalls were all closing, and we needed to get back to Mid Valley. So H forked out RM 10 for the Datin VCD, and the both of us raced back to the car.  We zoomed back to Mid Valley, and parked in the huge parking lot. By now, the place was nearly deserted - except at the cinema. The fact it was midnight and yet there were still many people queuing up to buy tickets surprised me. We decided to get some popcorn and some Coke, but of course, we were a bit short of cash. We hunted down an ATM machine located far away on the other side of the Megamall - only to discover it wasn't working. Doh!  We then scrounged about in our pockets and dug up enough small change to buy popcorn (small) and 2 Cokes (small). There were people staring at us as we stood there counting coins, but we didn't care. We were hungry and thirsty.  We finally entered the screening room at around half-past-12, and walked in all the way to the front. I hate those seats. I was hoping that maybe there'll be empty seats near the back by the time the movie starts, but no such luck. When the titles started rolling, the place was packed. Damn.  I could now launch into a review of the movie, but I'll leave that to  urlLink others . I will say this though. The slow pacing of the movie turned out to be a godsend. Due to our positions sitting so close to the screen, not only was my neck aching, but my eyes wouldn't have been able to handle all the images flashing across the screen if it had been something like  urlLink Van Helsing . Fortunately, I was able to take in the whole movie. I thought it was OK, got preachy in some places, but the storm effects were cool. And that's all I have to say about that.  After the movie ended, H and I took our leave and I returned home for much-needed sleep, while I suspect H decided to introduce himself to his newly acquired Datin.  This is now officially the longest post I have ever written. And I am feeling sleepy. So that'll be all. Enjoy the rest of the weekend. And, oh yes -  urlLink Daulat Tuanku !

      I have only just joined the ride that is the new and improved  urlLink Yahoo! Messenger , approximately 2 months after its launch. Normally, I don't go into this Instant Messaging craze, primarily becasue I used to connect to the Net via  urlLink dial-up . Now that I have  urlLink broadband , I've been going crazy and downloading scores of huge (legal and safe) freeware/open-source software. Also been downloading movies, MP3s (yes, there's still some out there), and other stuff I cannot mention in case anyone who knows anyone in my family is reading this right now...  So I now am on Yahoo! Messenger. It is good. It has avatars, as mentioned by this  urlLink blogger   urlLink here . I have tried my level best ( Do I sound like a politician? Forgive me, I try not to ) to create an avatar that looks like me. Instead the avatar looks like a cool dude for whom the ladies can go all crazy - which, sadly, is definitely not me.  Anyway, you can now see (as indicated on the sidebar) whether I'm online or not, so feel free to send me an IM. (The ID is sashi1977.) Just please make sure you let me know who you are and how you came across my Yahoo ID, just to avoid any unpleasantness, ok?

         Cool  is not a word generally applied to football managers. They're determined, competitive, ambitious, frazzled, triumphant, dejected, etc. But not cool.  Yesterday I was watching the snippets from  urlLink BBC World  of the press conference  urlLink announcing  Jose Mourinho as the new  urlLink Chelsea  manager, and let me tell ya, this guy is cool.  His refreshing confidence coupled with youth (in comparison to other managers) and -  fortunately in today's media-influenced world - good looks gives him "star quality".  Already, he has provided some  urlLink soundbites  that might prove as memorable as  urlLink Shankly's quotes :   We have top players and, sorry if I'm arrogant, we have a top manager.  The biggest ambition I have is to win the first Premiership match on 14 August. The second ambition is to win the second Premiership match on 21 August and we will keep going like this.   Please don't call me arrogant, but I'm European champion and I think I'm a special one.  Porto supporters know what I am and what I give and nobody can erase what I did at the club. And my players know what I am and that after that match I was the proudest manager in the world.   Is this man cool or what? Chelsea fans are damn lucky....  *sigh*

        I popped down the road to check out the new, all-improved Bangsar Village today. Although it's technically been open a few days already, today was the official opening day.   As a relatively long-time Bangsarian (been here since 1990), plus the fact that this place is literally a stone's throw from my house (well, maybe with the help of a slingshot), I'm quite delighted that the long-abandoned former abode of Hankyu Jaya has now been resurrected.  But take note, this is not another mega-shopping centre ala  urlLink Suria KLCC  or the monstrous  urlLink Mid Valley Megamall . It isn't even a chic hangout joint for the well-heeled expats like the Bangsar Shopping Centre. This place seems to basically be a slightly souped-up neighbourhood convenience store.  It took me approximately 10 minutes to walk the entire length of the place (although that's also due to my rather fast walking speed, a habit picked up in England that I'm unable to shake off), so it's not really that big.  Once I got the measure of the place, I took a much slower walk (which kind of results in me acting like John Cleese in those  urlLink Ministry of Silly Walks  sketches) and tried to take slightly closer look at the joint.  The Village Grocer has a large supermarket there, and it looks like they were already doing brisk business. Now, for those not used to Bangsar, there already exists a popular grocery and convenience store in Lucky Garden - TMC. Indeed, locals like to think it was because of TMC's overwhelming popularity (especially among the older generation) that led to Hankyu Jaya's downfall. So, Village Grocer certainly has its work cut out if they're going to pull TMC's loyal customers towards them.  Other places (that I can remember off the top of my head) are  urlLink Nando's , a toy store ( urlLink Toys R Us ?), two video/music stores, an electronics store (with plasma TVs and DVD players), a hairstylist ( urlLink Kool Kutz ), and a sports clothes store (where an overzealous shop assistant kept shadowing me while I was browsing around - I really wanted to turn around and throw a punch at him, but fortunately I decided he wasn't worth having his teeth embedded in my knuckles.)  There were also a couple of places for dining (besides  urlLink Nando's ), but I didn't try out any of those places. There's also a space for  urlLink MPH  to move in from their present location, which is next to  urlLink Maybank .  There's also a lot more parking spaces in the underground parking area. Will this means the end of double-parking along Jalan Telawi? I doubt it...  So what is Bangsar Village? Think Suria KLCC without the sophistication, Megamall without the extra space, Berjaya Times Square without the hype, and Bangsar Shopping Centre without the expats. Don't forget to subtract expensive retail outlets, young, upwardly-mobile execs with laptops, and lovey-dovey couples.   That  is Bangsar Village.  Oh hell, I know I'm generalising, and I do hope this place turns out to be a success. I'd hate to see the place being abandoned again in the future.  Read more on Bangsar Village  urlLink here .  On another note, I've got my tix for  urlLink I, Robot  tomorrow. Will it be, as this  urlLink blogger  says,  " urlLink the best example of fanfiction ever " , or am I going to come out of the cinema thinking, "Thank God  urlLink Isaac Asimov  isn't alive to see this"...?  Hmmmmm....

      Found this in my Inbox this morning. A slight twist to the conventional  urlLink Nigerian 419 scams :  STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.  Dear Friend,  My name is Mr. Ian Shipman (A British Citizen), I work in a bank here  in the Germany with a corresponding office in UK.  I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money from a  deceased account, though I know that a transaction of this magnitude  will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well  at the conclusion of this transaction I decided to contact you due to  the urgency of this transaction.  PROPOSITION.  I am the account officer of a foreigner named Mr & Mrs. Raymond Beck in  our UK branch office before I move to Germany for official assignment.  Mr. Raymond Beck died long with his wife in the plane crash of 31 October, 1999 on board  the Egyptian Airline 990 alongside other passengers.  Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward  to lay claims to this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund  from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in  our banking guidelines.  Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as  next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully  worked out for the funds (US$35,000,000.00) to be released in your favor as the beneficiary's  next of kin. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the  probate an order of mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries.  Because after four to five years the money will be called back to the  bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money will be shared amongst  the directors of the bank. So it is on this Note I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used  as the Next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow The bank  directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the  year.  Endeavour to furnish me the following informations if you are  interested.  1. Your first and last names 2. Complete mailing address 3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers.  These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the  appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor before the  transfer can be made.  I shall be compensating you with 20% of the Whole funds on final  conclusion of this Project for your assistance, and 10% set aside for any expenses incured  by both of us and 70% shall be for me, for investment purposes, because  I intend to retire from active banking service after the conclusion of this transaction.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of  the trust we have bestowed in you  Please reply to shipman2005@zwallet.com  Best regards, Ian Shipman.  It even came with an attachment, but I didn't even bother trying to open it.  You just have to give it to these guys, they are nothing if not resourceful..   Another laughable - although sinister - twist to the 419 scam is the one where the shadowy e-mail sender threatens to assasinate you if you don't pay them  US$40,000.00!  we have received a fax message from our headquaters, new york, this morning to inform you to produce a mandatory sum of US$40,000.00 (FOURTHY THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) only,into our account given below in nigeria within ninety six hours{96}, alternatively you will be SNIPPED and GUNNED down during the period of our oncoming anniversary of fifty years.  Note : - Your death has been paid for by someone you offended sometime ago and it will be adviceable that you co-operate with us a.s.a.p.  Read the full article:  urlLink 419ers morph into Murder Incorporated   On another note, it is  urlLink announced  that the official full title of the next  urlLink Star Wars  movie is  Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith . The movie is scheduled for release on May 19, 2005.

      For reasons that I cannot and will not disclose, I found myself at a weighing machine at a certain shopping centre, the one near the escalator next to some restaurant (names elude me at the moment).  I haven't weighed myself since 1995 - yes, it's true, it's true. It's not that I'm afraid of knowing my weight, it's just that I've never had any reason to know it. It's not like I'm going to try out for some boxing and need to find out to what weight class I belong (if I did though, it'd be the ultra-light-feather-weight division).  But this time, I did weigh myself. And the result did kind of surprise me. Without giving details, let me say that I now weigh 5 kg more that I did in 1995. Let me re-state that:  I've gained a net total of  5 kg  over the last  9 years .  When I saw the result, I said: "Hmmmm." Then I mentioned the 5k's in 9 years story to my two colleagues standing nearby, as all good busybodies tend to do.  When my (male) colleague heard it, he said: "You eat only breadcrumbs ah?" When my (female) colleague heard it, she said: "OH MY GOD! YOU LUCKY [censored!]"  Then she went on ranting about how she gains like a billion pounds everytime she inhales or something like that. I wasn't paying any attention 'cos then a girl walked by wearing a tight white Donna Karan t-shirt and some really tight Levi's jeans. She was walking with some guy or girl wearing something or other, but they don't matter.  And I said: "Hmmmmmmmm." My (male) colleague said: "Damn! I want that for Christmas!" My (female) colleague was saying something, possibly to us, but we weren't listening.  Oh, and I collected some passport-sized photos of myself today. As usual, they came out badly. I now realise, there comes a time when you should stop blaming the photographer and the camera, and start thinking that maybe, just maybe, you really are that ugly.

       This is an updated/edited entry.   Previously, in this post, I made an uncharacteristic rant at issues and problems that I usually do not blog about. When I started blogging, I made a conscious decision to NOT blog about matters too close to home - but, yesterday, in a moment of blind rage and extreme frustration, I lost my temper, which I regret.  Whatever my personal problems may be, I will deal with them calmly and in a civilized manner. Throwing tantrums and threatening bodily harm to people is not my style.  In the meantime, if there was anyone who was disturbed by my harsh language previously, I apologise.

       Prev:  urlLink Vol I  |  urlLink Vol II  |  urlLink Vol III  |  urlLink Vol IV  |  urlLink Vol V     This is based on a true story. Names, places and dates have been changed to protect the innocent, and in the case of one guy, the very stupid. Some scenes have been dramatized for that extra oomph.    The sun was setting in the distant horizon. A young couple could be seen walking hand-in-hand down the path leading from the row of shops and restaurants towards the University-owned accomodation halls. The dinner was great, and Steve was in a good mood - he had not screwed up in anyway so far, and if all went well, he was hoping to get lucky later tonight. Mina was humming a little tune she had heard on the radio earlier that day, and everytime she reached the chorus, she'd give Steve's hand a little squeeze. It was a picture-perfect evening, and Steve felt it could only get better.  "Mina? MINA!! Holy cow! It IS you! Hi! It's me! Wow, I haven't seen you in ages! How are you? You look great! Wow, this is unbelievable!"  Steve almost stumbled and fell when the strange guy suddenly stepped across their path, and it took him some time to get his composure back as the mysterious, tall stranger continued to prattle on.  "You do remember me, don't you? We were in school together, the Co-Operative Soc, you and I were - "  Mina quickly interrupted him: "Yes. Yes. I remember. School. How are you, Matt?"  "I'm great! What are you doing here? Oh, wait, what am I saying? Of course you're going to the University, what else would you be doing here?"  "Yes. You too?"  "Ahem."  "Yup! I'm taking Finance! Had a hell of a time trying to get accepted here, but perseverance finally paid off!"  "Really? You don't say?"  "AHEM." Steve cleared his throat a second time, hoping to make his presence felt somehow. Mina picked up on the signal instantly.  "Oh, Matt. This is Steve." She paused for a second or two. "My boyfriend."  Steve couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment. Mina had always introduced him to her friends as "my boyfriend, Steve!" For some reason, he felt Mina didn't want Matt to know that.  "Well, well, well, Stevo! You lucky devil! You got yourself a great girl there! Bet you already know that, don't ya?"  "It's Steve. How do you do?"   "Yeah, anyway, listen, amazing coincidence me walking into you two. I'm having a party at my digs later tonight. I'm staying off-campus, at a house I'm sharing with a couple of course mates. Why don't you join us? BBQ, beer, we even have a dude who makes a mean stir-fried chicken! Sounds great, right? Come on, you'll love it!"  Steve looked at Mina. He could read her body language well enough by now, and at the moment every fibre in her being was screaming NO! It was a good thing too, given all the plans Steve had already made for the evening.  "Hmm, sorry Matt, we'll have to pass. Mina and I sort of already have plans.."  "Really? Like what?"  Steve was momentarily thrown for a loop. This Matt guy seemed a bit thick - couldn't he understand a hint when he saw one?  "Errr. Well, we were, err, going to, uhm, going to...."  "We'll come to your party, Matt."  Steve made a double-take at Mina, unable to believe his ears at what she just said. He was so sure - no, he was certain - that Mina did not want, under any circumstance, to go the party.  "OK, great! Here's the address!" Matt slid a piece of paper into Steve's shirt pocket. "I'll see you guys later, around nine-ish? Great, see ya!!"  He shook Steve's hand vigorously, and before anyone could do anything, he quickly leaned over and kissed Mina on the cheek. Then shouting more goodbyes, he walked off towards the town centre, leaving Steve and Mina standing where they were.  Steve watched Mina for a few moments. She looked worried, sad, flustered, all at once. Steve didn't know what to make of it all.   "Why did you say we'd go to the party?"  "I just said that 'cos I wanted him to stop pestering us. He wasn't going to stop until we agreed."  "You know him very well, don't you?" Steve couldn't keep the jealous tone out of his voice.  "I knew him at school. We barely spoke. Come on, let's go."  Mina walked off quickly, and Steve found himself trailing her all the way to her hall of residence. At the hall doorway, Steve, as usual, tried to engage her in some small talk, but Mina wasn't listening. She used her electronic car-key to open the door, wished him goodnight, and immediately walked in, letting the door close behind her.   For the second time that evening, Steve felt a twinge a disappointment again. She obviously had a lot of things on her mind to forget their customary goodnight kiss.   Steve looked up at Mina's room window. The light didn't come on. Mina must have gone straight to bed.  As he left the courtyard, walking up the path towards his flats, he began to ponder the strange events of the last hour or so. Everything seemed to go so well, they were happy, she was happy.  Then they bumped into Matt.  Steve stopped abruptly, and turned around. There was so many questions swimming around in his head, and he needed some answers. And he needed them now.  He had a party to go to.   Next:  urlLink Vol VII

      From an  urlLink article  by  urlLink Daniel Terdiman  in  urlLink Wired News :    "When it's fun and it's going really well, you feel (great), and when it's not fun, it starts feeling like ... when you have to go to a job every day from nine to five," said Jason Kottke, the author of  urlLink kottke.org  and  urlLink remaindered links , popular blogs about technology, culture, photography and other topics. "You start to feel like the readers are depending on you, and ... like you have to post something whether you feel like it or not, and that can be depressing."  Blogging for some is an obvious labor of love, and having a forum that belongs to them and enables them to write whatever they want, and have it seen by throngs of readers, is a very attractive proposition. This is especially true because blogging is a timeless endeavor and one that allows authors to vent about whatever's on their minds.    Read more:  urlLink Bloggers Suffer Burnout

      I happen to be an incorrigible couch potato. However, these days I'm not as bad as I used to be in the pre- urlLink Astro  era. Back then, I would generally plan my days (or nights) based on what's showing on TV. Nowadays only a live telecast of a football match (specifically if it involved  urlLink Liverpool ) would force me to clear my calendar - not that I'd usually have anything planned in the first place..    Nevertheless, I still do have a sort of a Must-See-TV list. These are shows that I'd try my darndest to catch. Fortunately some of these programs are repeated a few times (on Astro) so I have some flexibility to "watch them when I want", as an  urlLink AXN  catchphrase goes.      Top on the list is  urlLink CSI . Not the  urlLink Miami  version, with their pretty-plastic-posing-performances that passes for acting these days. The original is witty, intelligent and often intense as well. Who'd have thought a show with so much geekiness would prove to be a worldwide hit? I've always believed that you could create a compelling show on trout fishing as long as you had strong, believable characters with good chemistry. Well-written stories help too, of course...      Next up,  urlLink Alias . Season 3 just premiered on Malaysian TV yesterday (Monday) night on  urlLink 8TV . As is usual in the Alias universe, each episode ends with a cliffhanger, as did yesterday's episode - and boy, was it a doozy! Now, most TV series do not employ this method, so for me, it's certainly a refreshing change. Plus  urlLink Jennifer Garner  is very hot as  urlLink Sydney Bristow . Some people may question her acting chops, but she does pretty well in her role, IMO. Those who watched yesterday's episode will remember the words she spoke to  urlLink Michael Vaughn  towards the end, her lines delivered with the right amount of sadness and fury, and in that moment I'd bet that many viewers would have been rooting for her and consigning Vaughn to the rubbish bin. I only hope AXN picks up Season 3 soon so I'd have more of a choice in selecting when to watch it.       urlLink The Amazing Race 5  finally arrived on AXN last week after a long hiatus. Now, for the most part, I've lost interest in reality TV shows. I gave up on  urlLink Survivor  about 2 seasons ago, and was never pulled in by Joe Bob Jane Millionaire Bachelor Whatever. But the thing that I like about the Amazing Race is its unpretentiousness. It really IS a reality TV show. There is no transparent, devious manipulation of settings and scenarios to provoke certain reactions from participants. All the cameras do is faithfully record teams racing each other around the world completing tasks in order to reach the finish line first (or at least not last), while working with teammates and occasionally others as well. There's rarely any "playing to the camera" moments, since everyone is too busy worrying about the task at hand. Perhaps this was one of the reasons why the show won the inaugaral  urlLink Emmy  for Best Reality TV Series.      Finally, there's  urlLink Malaysian Idol . I started watching this show specifically because of my prior interest in  urlLink American Idol . I like the concept of a straight-up talent show where the contestants are judged SOLELY on their talent and singing ability. There isn't any behind-the-scenes hidden cameras recording what they did, what they said, what they ate, etc. All I want to know is whether these people can sing. I was delighted when  urlLink Fantasia Barrino  won AI3 because it proved (to me, at least) that talent will win out in the end. It is with this hope that I'm compelled to stay tuned to MI. There are a number of people who question the qualifications (and the performances) of the  urlLink judges  - Roslan Aziz, Fauziah Latiff and Paul Moss - but regardless, their jobs are mostly over. They've selected the 33 participants who will then go on to the next phase where they'll be singing live on national TV and it'll be up to us to vote who will go on to the finals. As an aside, I'm hoping that MI, like AI, will allow toll-free voting (for landlines) along with the expected SMS voting. If not, then there'll be no votes from me. I'm sorry, but I ain't spending RM30 a month on prepaid cards just to see it go down the drain. But if toll-free voting is set up, then I already know who I'm voting for. Her name is Jacklyn Joshua, and she's got the voice, the style, and the personality to be the first ever Malaysian Idol. At least that's my view for the time being  lah . If she screws up later,  takde chance lah beb ... For the rest of ya MI fans, remember AI host  urlLink Ryan Seacrest's  words: Vote For The Talent!  Well, that's my Must-See-TV list. What's yours?

       Prev:  urlLink Vol I  |  urlLink Vol II  |  urlLink Vol III  |  urlLink Vol IV     This is based on a true story. Names, places and dates have been changed to protect the innocent, and in the case of one guy, the very stupid. Some scenes have been dramatized for that extra oomph.    "Congratulations to the newly-elected office-bearers! Come on students, give them a big hand!"  A handful of students gathered in the cramped classroom dutifully applauded, while the rest continued to wait for the first annual meeting of the school's Co-Operative Society to mercifully come to an end. The teacher - like most teachers of her age and experience, she had developed a useful numbness of the senses when it came to feeling student enthusiasm - continued to prattle on about the sacred and noble responsibilities entrusted upon the office bearers and how their behaviour during their term in office would affect the good name and dignity of the society, the school and the fate of the free world in general.  At the front of the classroom, five students stood facing the rest of the students (some of whom were becoming openly hostile at the delay in concluding the meeting). In the centre of the group, a tall boy, with sharp eyes and possessing of a calm yet regal demeanour, stood still while trying to suppress the feelings of delight that swirled within himself. It wasn't just the fact that he had just been elected the President of the society, a society that had in its coffers a relatively large amount of capital. The president had certain plans for the money, but he wasn't thinking of it at the moment. He could have been understandably pleased by his success in manipulating, bribing and threatening the members of the society to cast their votes, but he wasn't thinking of that either.  The fact was, Matt was delighted simply because he was standing next to Mina, who'd just been elected the Vice-President.  From the moment he laid eyes on her, Matt knew she was the one for him. She was attractive, intelligent, and was very graceful, both in manner and in appearance. She had that rare ability to make people with whom she'd be talking to feel like they were the only person in the general vicinity. In another place, in another time, in another world, she could have been royalty. A princess. A queen.  His queen.  It had not been difficult to persuade the members of the society to elect her as his vice-president. Her genuine popularity coupled with his money and barely-concealed threats ensured an easy victory. But this was just the first phase in his plan. Now that she'd be working alongside him, he had the time and opportunity to gain her trust, her friendship, and hopefully her affections. He had it all worked out. It was only a matter of time before the king got his royal consort.  What Matt did not take into account was that he wasn't the only one busily making plans to win the fair maiden's hand. If he had only taken a moment to take his eyes off Mina giving her acceptance speech, and glanced instead at Alan, the newly-elected Treasurer standing beside him, he would have recognised the desire that was so very evident in his colleague's eyes. Matt could have then persuaded Alan - by any means necessary - to give up his longing for Mina and settle for being a useful and wealthy ally of the king. But Matt did not see Alan, for he had only eyes for Mina. And Alan was left to cultivate his own desires, his own feelings for Mina. He'd already decided, once the meeting was over, that he'd ask her out on a date.   For Matt, Alan's decision would prove to be the start of his downfall.  For Alan, it would prove to be fatal.

       Prev:  urlLink Vol I  |  urlLink Vol II  |  urlLink Vol III     This is based on a true story. Names, places and dates have been changed to protect the innocent, and in the case of one guy, the very stupid. Some scenes have been dramatized for that extra oomph.   Matt had to work for everything he got. Life never gave him an even break. His mother died when he was still an infant, and his father - a man who couldn't tell the difference between a diaper and a rag - left him at his maternal grandparents' home.   His grandfather worked as a newspaper deliveryman while his grandmother scrubbed toilets for wealthy homeowners. Matt could see the hard work they put in day in and day out, only to reap measly financial returns. He knew, at a very young age, that he would never become like them. He would never be poor. And he would do anything to avoid such a life.  Matt was a sensible young lad. He never dreamed of striking it rich via lottery tickets, or by getting a stable job in the government sector and work until he retires so he could live of the pension. He was smart enough to recognise that the truly rich were people who created opportunities, not simply look for them.  At the age of 11, he began doing homework for classmates who were not academically-inclined. Of course, he charged for the service. It helped that he was a very bright student and was able to grasp many complex subjects very quickly. His "business" grew so popular that he would soon be taking orders from dozens of students to complete their homework for them. He ended up outsourcing some of the orders to other bright colleagues - in return for a small cut of the profits.   His enterprise hit rocky waters after the school headmaster found out about it from a disgruntled student who felt it was unfair that he got a B for an honestly completed assignment while another student received an A using Matt's Homework Express Service. Matt was suspended 2 weeks for the misdemeanour.  He spent the two weeks taking orders via telephone.  When Matt began life as a secondary school student at age 13, he decided it was time to embark on a new business venture. It was the year of the World Cup, and football fever was in the air. Matt wasn't a keen footballer (he preferred hockey), but he knew there was money to be made. He began by obtaining football posters and pin-ups on credit from a fellow student who worked at his uncle's magazine store (he'd tear the centre-fold posters from the magazines with utmost care) and sold them for 50 cents each. He paid his "business partner" 10 cents per poster acquired.  Matt then got bolder and enlisted a group of 5 burly friends to assist him in expanding his business venture. At a  pasar malam  (night market) on the other side of town, Matt and his pals scouted around until they found the stall they were looking for: a couple of guys selling knock-off World Cup football jerseys. They were not identical to the original football kits, but Matt knew that not many schoolkids could afford to buy original kits anyway. With 2 of his buddies distracting the stallowners, two other kids made a lunge at the jerseys, grabbed a handful and raced away separately. The two stall owners ran after them along with a handful of other stall owners. The  two friends of Matt (the ones who provided the distraction) then reacted as if they were going to help but knocked over the generator powering the lights around the stall, which resulted in the power going out for a brief period. In the confusion, Matt and another friend quickly grabbed as many jerseys they could and stuffed them into a bag. They quickly walked away before power was restored. The two kids who had ran away with the kits earlier then dumped the jerseys on the side of the road. The stall owners, once they had retrieved the jerseys, gave up the chase - only to return and discover that most of their other kits were gone too. Matt and his business partners made a financial killing out of selling the jerseys. His customers even included teachers who couldn't afford original products with their low income.  By now, Matt was growing into a handsome young man with a penchant for making money. People gravitated to him, for he was a natural leader. He always listened to his friends' troubles and helped whenever he can. He wasn't simply being generous or kind, although he may very well have had some genuine altruistic motives. Mainly though it was because he was smart enough to form alliances with people who he felt could help him achieve his goals in the future.  By the time he was 16, he was a reasonably wealthy teenager. He'd never spend his money on anything ostentatious as a gold watch (he'd buy knock-off Rolex watches from Petaling Street) or expensive sneakers (he always wore a pair of cheap Bata shoes). He had his hands in a half-dozen business enterprises - only some of which were legal. They included football betting, renting pirated videos (some of them porn) and even a protection racket where he's charge rich kids a small monthly fee in return for protection from bullies. He always neglected mentioning that the bullies worked for him as well.   But he always appeared neat and tidy and projected an image of classy sophistication. He maintained high grades in school and was quite an active participant in extra-curriculur activities. It was one of these activities that would bring him to the attention of an attractive young female student. A young girl whose eyes would make Matt's heart flutter, the way a sparrow shivers in the palm of your hand. A young girl who would one day force Matt into making the biggest gamble of his life.  A young girl named Mina.   Next:  urlLink Vol V     Much thanks goes to  urlLink Ash.Ox  for his very crucial and timely assistance in the completion of this chapter.

      I was going to write a long rant, but after watching  urlLink Malaysian Idol  last night (a great episode, by the way), I've calmed down quite a bit now.  Anyway, other (better) bloggers have already blogged about this, so I'll just direct you to their sites:    Idlan Zakaria's  urlLink Organised Chaos  :  urlLink Did a Star article plagiarise Sashi's post?

       Prev:  urlLink Vol I  |  urlLink Vol II     This is based on a true story. Names, places and dates have been changed to protect the innocent, and in the case of one guy, the very stupid. Some scenes have been dramatized for that extra oomph.   For Steve, bliss was to be defined as: a) intense happiness b) a feeling of being on top of the world c) having that special someone to share your heart with d) lasting seven months long.  After their initial meeting in a lecture hall, Steve and Mina began trading phone calls and e-mails, initially to discuss their academic work, but soon graduating to subjects of a more personal nature, like life, love and family. They found it easy to talk to each other, sharing intimate details they'd dare not tell others. It was an open, honest and close friendship.   Now, Steve came from a relatively happy, stable home. However, being the first person in his family to go to a foreign university, Steve was aware of the pressure on him to succeed with flying colours. The fact that his parents had mortgaged everything to send him here added to the weight on his shoulders. From the moment he got here, he'd been completely immersed in his studies, his only distractions being the weekly football live telecasts or the Wednesday night screening of  urlLink The X-Files  on satellite TV.  The last thing Steve needed now was to be involved in a serious relationship.  But life has a tendency to dish out unexpected twists.  At first, Steve was just happy to be with Mina, even if it did seem like a platonic relationship. Gradually, both Steve and Mina became aware of the mutual attraction between themselves, but they were hesitant in making the first move. Fortunately, Mina's friends came to their rescue by arranging what seemed to be a group gathering at a quiet little restaurant one Friday night. On the night though, only Steve and Mina showed up. It didn't take them long to realize they'd been set up - for which they were very grateful.  The dinner date - and it was a date, no doubts about that - would prove to be the first of many. They would initially end in the same way: Steve would escort Mina back to her flat, waiting while she swiped her electronic security card over the card-reader to open the door, expressing satisfaction over the dinner and the date, promising to call her in the morning, and when he would run out of small-talk, she would quickly give him a peck on the cheek and walk in to the building. Steve would wait for a few more minutes till he saw her room light come on, and then he'd walk back to his flats with a bounce in his steps.  In Steve's eyes, Mina was his soulmate. She laughed at his feeble jokes, wasn't embarassed to hold hands with him in public, made him chicken soup when he came down with hay-fever, and even happily referred to him as her boyfriend to friends and strangers alike.  In Mina's eyes, Steve was a strong candidate to be The One. She would not tell anyone for many months, but she knew she was already falling in love.  They were not aware of a third pair of eyes scrutinising their relationship. In this person's eyes, Steve was a rival - and would do anything to break them up.

       Prev:  urlLink Vol I     This is based on a true story. Names, places and dates have been changed to protect the innocent, and in the case of one guy, the very stupid. Some scenes have been dramatized for that extra oomph.   The lecturer looked up from his notes, annoyed at being interrupted by the latecomer.  "Young lady. You are late. I do not tolerate tardiness in my class."  The poor girl tried to defend herself: "I'm very sorry sir, but.."  "Please do not waste any more of my time with your excuses. Take your seat. I will excuse you today since this is the first class, but I WILL lock the doors in the future once class begins. That goes for all the rest of you, too. Now, as I was saying earlier...."  As the lecture resumed, she began walking towards the rows of seats looking for an empty one.  In the last occupied row at the back of the hall, Steve watched her approaching. He couldn't make out much detail when she first walked in and brought the lecture to a halt. But as she came closer, Steve, somewhat unconsciously, began critically appraising her.  She had black wavy hair, pulled back and tied into a ponytail that reached just below her shoulders. It bobbed from side to side as she kept swiveling her head left to right trying to look for a place to sit. It did not help matters that the lights had been dimmed because the lecturer wanted to project some slides.  She was wearing a simple green jumper, and a pair of baggy track bottoms. Not the most attractive of outfits, but Steve did notice subtle hints of curves underneath the plain clothes.  She was two rows away from him, when he was finally able to see her face in all its glory. She was wearing a rather large pair of glasses, perched precariously on her small, button nose. She had well-defined cheekbones, but you would have missed it unless you were actually looking for it, for the minute details was overshadowed by the glasses.  She wasn't stunningly beautiful. Steve had seen enough pictures in magazines to know what stunningly beautiful women were supposed to look like. Yet, Steve did find himself strangely attracted to this girl. He realized that her features, if considered separately, were indicative of a Plain Jane appearance, yet combined together, made for a rather pretty, if understated, look.  He could see now that she was beautiful, or at least had the potential to be beautiful if the right clothes and make-up were applied. She also had a graceful walk. She was neat and clean. She smelled faintly of an exotic perfume.  And she was now standing right next to him.  "Is that seat taken?"  She was pointing to the seat to Steve's right, the one with his backpack and files on it.  "Erm. No."  Steve hastily gathered his things and half-stood to allow her to get to the seat. As she did so, her legs brushed against his lightly. She was quick to apologise, but Steve barely heard her, since he was still feeling the tinge of electricity coursing through his body.  As she settled into her seat, Steve remained half-standing holding his bag and files as he contemplated his next course of action.  "Is there a problem up there?"  All eyes turned to the back, trying to catch a glimpse of the person to whom the lecturer's question was directed.  Steve shook his head vigorously and quickly dumped his things on to floor of the aisle and immediately sat down. The lecturer, with an exaggerated sigh, turned back towards his slides.  "Are those your notes?"  Steve turned towards her. Now that her face was only inches away, he could see that behind the comically-large spectacles was a pair of beautiful eyes, with pupils looking like perfectly spherical brown islands in a clear sea of white. It took him a full 5 seconds to realise he had forgotten to breathe.  "Err. Yes."  "Mind if I copied the earlier parts?"  "Sure, but there's not a lot actually. I'll lend them to you during the break."  "Great, thanks. I'm Mina, by the way."  "Steve. Nice to meet you."  For the rest of the lecture, Steve barely heard the drone of the lecturer's voice. What he mostly heard was the scratching of her pen on her notepad, the soft rustling of the sleeve of her jumper on her pad as she wrote, the near-silent, measured sound of her breathing, and most of all, the infrequent yet all too eagerly awaited moments when she would whisper to him:  "I didn't get that. What did he say?"  Looking back, Steve would have called this the beginning of the happiest period of his young life.  He might also call it his one, true regrettable experience.

       Prev:  urlLink Vol I  |  urlLink Vol II  |  urlLink Vol III  |  urlLink Vol IV  |  urlLink Vol V  |  urlLink Vol VI     This is based on a true story. Names, places and dates have been changed to protect the innocent, and in the case of one guy, the very stupid. Some scenes have been dramatized for that extra oomph.   Steve looked at the piece of paper in his hand and noted the address again. He looked up at the double-storey house in front of him. He checked the paper again. This was the address, alright.  Steve distinctly remembered Matt saying that there was supposed to be a party here, but there didn't seem to be any noise - or even people. The lights were on, but Steve couldn't detect any movement through the windows. He wondered whether the party had moved to another location.  Just then the door opened, and a man staggered out. Steve could see immediately that he was drunk. He stumbled across the driveway and halted in front of a tall hedge by the side of the house. He then unzipped his trousers and began peeing on the grass. As he was easing himself, he looked around - and noticed Steve, outside the gate with paper in hand, staring at him.  "The toilets are full," he said, smilingly, by way of explanation.  Steve said nothing. He'd seen enough of such behaviour in this country, so much so that it doesn't surprise him anymore.  "You here for the party?" enquired the peeing drunk, apparently feeling the need to initiate small talk while he emptied his bladder.  "Yeah." Steve disliked small talk.   "Go on in, then. Whatcha waiting for?" asked the drunken urinator, as he shifted his feet to avoid the slowly flooding patch of grass in front of him.  "Is Matt here?"  "Yeah, I think so. Probably in his room shagging his boyfriends!" He laughed uproariously, as drunken men are wont to do, and then swore violently as he accidentally directed his urine stream on to his trouser legs.  Steve, feeling the time had come to leave the drunken fool with his soaked trousers, walked up to the door that had been left ajar, and entered the house.  He could hear soft music coming from upstairs, and he could see some people lounging around in the sofas and chairs in the hall. No one was moving about too much, and the reasons for the lack of mobility could easily be seen in the dozens of empty alcohol bottles, champagne glasses and beer mugs strewn about the place.  He noticed a girl leaning on a wall, with one foot on the bottom step of the stairway leading upstairs. She looked at him, as if staring through a haze of smoke, and simply said, "I'm not ready. Give me another minute."  Steve ignored her comment  - and everything it might have implied - and asked about Matt.  "You're one of them, eh?" She smiled, and moved closer to him. "Bet you I could turn you the other way after some time alone with me, baby" she said, as she took his hand and placed it on her chest.  Steve hesitated - and then removed his hand, albeit reluctantly. "Is Matt upstairs?"  The girl sighed and replied in the affirmative. As Steve began walking up the steps, she called out to him: "Sweetie, if you get tired of guys, give me a call. I'm listed in the phone booths!" She laughed and then started coughing, as other voices joined in laughing as well.  Steve carefully walked up to the first floor landing, thinking that maybe it was time he grew a moustache and a beard, when a door near the stairwell opened.  It was Matt.  Matt didn't look drunk or stoned, but he was certainly buzzing.   "Stevo! You came at last! And I thought you guys were gonna ditch me! Where's Mina?"  Steve, thankful that Mina wasn't here, replied that she was feeling unwell, and chose to stay at her place to rest.  "Aww, too bad," said Matt. "Well, at least you're here! That's still good - you wanna drink something? We got all kinds, man!"  "No, thanks, really. I just wanted to come and talk to you. But if you're busy, I'll come back another -"  "Don't worry about it, dude. We can talk all we want right here, all my guests are occupied right now, they don't really need me," Matt sniggered, as if recalling a secret joke.  "That's OK, I just thought, that maybe, you know, maybe when you're feelling better, I mean, when you're in a better frame of mind..."   Matt understood immediately. "I'm not drunk. Nor am I high on anything. I'm as sober as you are."  "Shit, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like - "  "That's OK," said Matt. "I guess when you came in here you thought you were in some kind of opium den, but hey, I don't have any problems with people who like to drink or do drugs or whatever. I may not agree with their lifestyle, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna stop them doing what they like. They're ordinary people, just like you or me or Mina - "  Steve winced when he heard her name on Matt's lips.  " - and they do ordinary things, like study, work and play, and they choose to indulge in whatever activities they see fit. Just because they choose snorting coke over watching Grandstand, and drinking Bacardi over reading Yeats, doesn't make them any lesser of a human being."  Steve would have liked to disagree with several of Matt's points, but he had to admire his way of speaking. Matt seemed to have an electric presence, an aura of authority and superiority that combined to make him appear larger than life. It wasn't just his words, but his delivery of them that made it so compelling. He could have said the sky was green, and people would have been nodding their heads in agreement.  Trying to change the subject, Steve blurted out the reason for his visit.  "I want to ask you about Mina."  Matt smiled. "She didn't tell you about me, did she? About us."  For a brief moment, Steve doubted himself. He wasn't sure if he was ready to hear everything - anything - about Mina and Matt.  Well, he'd opened the bag, he might as well go all the way. "What do you mean by us?"   Matt stared at Steve for a few seconds, and then said, "C'mon, follow me. I think we'd better have a quiet talk in my study."  "Study? You have a study?"  Matt laughed. "Sure! Don't you? Oh yeah, you live in Uni digs. Well, communal living isn't too bad, I guess, but I prefer my privacy."  Steve followed Matt down the corridor. As they passed a few doors on either side of them, Steve could hear vague sounds of fun, merrymaking - and more often than not, pleasure.  "What's everyone doing? I thought this was a party," asked Steve, whose general experiences with parties involved funny hats, helium balloons, musical chairs, spiked punchbowls and overpaid DJs.  "Don't ask. Don't tell." Matt stopped in front of a newly-painted door, its brown frame shining in the light from the overhead halogen lightbulb. "And it  is  a party. Their kind of party."  As Matt ushered Steve into the dimly lit room, he said, "You know, Stevo, I think you and I are gonna be really good friends."  Steve, for once, felt in agreement. Matt didn't seem like such a bad fellow. He wondered why Mina felt uncomfortable with Matt - maybe he'll find out now.  Matt closed the door behind them, directed Steve to a chair by the bookcase across the room, and walked up to the huge desk nearby, behind which was a high-backed chair, the kind preferred by CEO's of Fortune 500 companies.  As he sat down, Matt looked at Steve, who was dragging the chair towards the desk. Not really a bad fellow, he thought. Another time, another place, they really could have been friends.  But Steve was with Mina. And that just won't do.   To be continued...

        I cannot profess to having read all of  urlLink Isaac Asimov's  works under his landmark "I, Robot" series. Just a couple of short stories, that's all. But when I saw the first trailers of the movie on the Net, I was pretty sure that there was no way Asimov could have written such a high-octane action thriller.  Having now seen the movie as well as having read the various reviews and behind-the-scenes stories about the film, I now understand why  urlLink she  called it  urlLink fanfiction .  Here's an explanation from  urlLink IMDB's   urlLink I, Robot   urlLink Trivia  section:  The movie originally started as a screenplay entitled "Hardwired", a classical-style murder mystery that read like a stage play, and was very much in the spirit of Asimov's "three laws" mysteries. When the original "Hardwired" script eventually reached Fox, after being developed at Disney with director Bryan Singer, new director Alex Proyas and writer Jeff Vintar opened up the story to fit a big budget studio film. When Fox acquired the rights to Isaac Asimov's story collection, Vintar spent two years adapting "Hardwired" to serve as a tenth story in the Asimov canon, complete with Susan Calvin and the Three Laws of Robotics. Writer Akiva Goldsman came on late in the process to tailor the script to Will Smith.  So, in other words, this movie was inspired by Asimov's stories, but is not an adaptation. With that in mind, it becomes easier to put all that " is it going to be faithful to the original ideas? " schtick away and just focus on the movie on its merits alone.  But first, the movie experience.  Ever since my  urlLink Day After Tomorrow fiasco , I've made some changes to my movie-watching style. I reserve my ticket in advance and collect them at least a day earlier. I watch movies alone (it's easier to get great seats when you're going solo). I make sure I've eaten before I even head out to the cinema - popcorn is NOT real food. I do not buy Coke/Pepsi/Peace Cola/etc - carbonated soft-drinks coupled with cold air-conditioning means serious bladder control issues. Water will do just fine. Finally, I now only patronize the  urlLink GSC  at  urlLink Mid Valley Megamall  - more screens, easier reservation processes, plus  dekat rumah aje ....  So there I was, at GSC Mid Valley, late Friday evening, waiting for the particular screening hall to be ready. I was feeling a little thirsty, so I bought a bottle of mineral water. Then the red light on the giant board - indicating whether halls were ready or not - turned green. I passed my ticket to the usher, he validated it by tearing it in half, and I was off to cinema hall no. 12.  As it turned out, I was the only person inside. In fact, I was so early, the credits were still rolling from the previous screening. I found my seat, placed my bottled water in the receptacle, and sat down. And waited. And waited. And then, just for a change of pace, I waited some more.  After a few minutes, I felt that I needed to visit the men's room. Actually, I didn't decide that, my bladder did, and I tend not to refuse orders coming from down there. I quickly made my way to the toilets, took care of business, washed my hands (I say this because apparently some people still don't know you're supposed to do so) and returned to the hall. Still no one in sight. Made my way back up to my seat - and discovered my bottle of mineral water had gone missing.  I looked around, checked the nearby rows, but to no avail. My bottle was nowhere to be found. I tried to remember - did I bring the bottle with me to the toilet? I rushed back to the men's room and found the particular cubicle I was in moments earlier was now occupied. So I waited for a while, checking out the sinks to see if I had left the bottle there. I hadn't.  Then I started hearing some noises. Disturbing sounds. Coming from the occupied cubicle. Moaning. Groaning. Then sounds of something dropping into water. More groaning. More stuff hitting water.  That's approximately when my nostrils picked up the,  erm , scent.  For those who do not know me, I have a big nose - and it's not for decorative purposes. I can smell stuff from far greater distances than most people can only dream of, with their inadequate noses and all. It's a rare gift, but I use my powers responsibly, and only for good.  But in situations like these, where I'm located very close to the source of the offending odour, my nose tends to take matters into its own nosehairs. It shuts down, forcing me to breathe through my mouth. My stomach, the nose's secret ally in case they end up together at Tribal Council, threatens to return its contents - with interest - if I do not beat a hasty retreat. Not being left with too many options, I surrendered to my body's will, and returned to the screening hall - sans one bottle of mineral water.  By now, there were others in the hall as well. But not all them moviegoers. There were some members of the cleaning staff around, picking up discarded popcorn packets, soft-drink cups - and abandoned water bottles.   Doh! There's a lesson in there somewhere folks, and if you know what it is, let me know.  After the obligatory trailers ( urlLink Alexander  looks interesting) and scenes of cavorting women a.k.a. beer commercials, the movie finally started.   Since I'm already running a little long here, I'll be brief. Will Smith performs his role with his now-familiar style that we've seen in  urlLink ID4 ,  urlLink Men In Black , etc. I know the dude can act (see  urlLink Six Degrees of Separation ,  urlLink Ali ), but there wasn't any need for him to stretch his acting skills here. In fact, almost all the characters here were played satisfactorily, but not in any way can the performances here be called brilliant.     Except one.  Sonny the robot, voiced by  urlLink Alan Tudyk  and created via the same process that resulted in the remarkable Gollum in the  urlLink LOTR  movies, showcased more acting chops than any of his movie co-stars. Not too long ago, people laughed at the possibility that CGI-actors could ever replace real life flesh-and-blood people. Well, maybe they won't replace human actors, but CGI-actors sure can give humans a run for their money, no?  Acting aside, the story was simple, but then again this is an action flick. The basic premise deals with the logic of Asimov's  urlLink 3 Laws of Robotics , while the writers have also inserted digs at a certain giant corporation as well. Some philosophy- ing  is also there, but essentially, this is a whodunnit. Someone is found dead, and it's Will Smith's Detective Spooner who has to piece together the clues to find the killer. He is aided by the lovely Dr Calvin (played by  urlLink Bridget Moynahan ) in this quest. And no, they don't end up together.     What else is there? Soundtrack was ok, not memorable though. Action was fast, sometimes intense, but unfortunately brief. I guess I just expect more after  urlLink Spider-Man 2 . Character development, almost non-existent. Except for Sonny's, of course. NS5 is alive!  My verdict:         UPDATE:   For those who're interested in robotics as well as Isaac Asimov's works, check out these links:     urlLink Isaac Asimov Home Page     urlLink 3 Laws Unsafe     urlLink Jenkins’ Spoiler-Laden Guide to Isaac Asimov     urlLink Sci-fi author Robert J.
