						   I think this is it!  Yeah!  Wow!  What are you talking about?  No, but I have to calm myself.  I am not comfortable with this right now!!  what the...  You don't need to get this.  since I myself could not decode the paragraph.  I don't know.  did not do anything.  I think I love her.  Too tired to think!  don't think no more.  You know in what year, I would like to imagine that I went to france and had lots of great sex with lots of beautiful girls!  those imagination was when I was in Taiwan.  Kind funny now!  Don't think so.  well, I can't wait.  But the fear caught up with me.  I look around.  I know one thing.  the Appearance really attract me, but as a whole, I like it.  Personalities really become everything.  I know that.  And I know what kind quality would I be attracted to!   Pictures, that's all I need!  I love to have those, although I also know I have nothing!  it's not just psychological, but in real!  man!  why the time.  what is inside of me is really not something I want to explore right now.  since there's nothing.  hopeless.  don't know why.  but I don't know.  maybe ther's something else.  but I just did not look.  on the sky, there's a bird.  a blue bird.  that have a black stripes at tips of each wings!  the while color and a dark blue is around the neck!  it's a blue jay.  Green land.  it's made up by the grass.   Sky is blue.  Nono is never here.  Seeing them successful, and watching myself falling into trap.  might just falling right now.  why cry out.  or did u cry?  scream?  or call for help.  my problems rely on myself to solve.  but how weak is me.  those chilling night.  it's terrible!  with the dark and only light poles in the parking lot.  why don't you yell for help.  but this is my qustion, dark, because I closed my eyes!  eyes wide shut!  irony?  no way.  but with a blue stripes on the tips of each wings.  we could still not fly.  Nono.  back in japan.  happy maybe ever after.  there would be tears, sweats, passion, and fun!  it's life.  no one can have with without those + pain.  but how you face it, how's your reaction toward it.  why?  but no?  too tired to think.  I don't really feel.  now I just found out that i am the one who needs to change along the whole thing.  I am the coleteroal damage here.  escape from it?  or make further damage?  I love her.  and should not die without saying it to her face.  but she is not here anymore.  then find other ones that you could say the samething to.  what are you going to attract other ones?  nothing.  I got nothing.  maybe that's something.   for whatit's worth.  plz don't sing.  singing is not your specialty.   the wonderous words are not flowing in my head.  since they are recently missing.  why should.  but neither.  whom would thought that I would think sher is beautiful.  but with that heart.  with that smile.  she is right where I want her.  but I know, I am not where I want her.  so where are you.  pizza is so good!  Maybe hakunamotata!  but who cares.  yoohu!  don't even try to underestimate yourself.  I know you are a coward right now.  but I am afraid  that the thoughts build up everyday, the wanting grow every now and then.  it's too dangerous!  what's on earth am I going to do about it!?  erect.  erect.  erect.  well, spayed it then.  I don't like to feel pain.  I still can take the pain emotionally.  there's no limit to those things.  anyway!  cuddle afterwards.  that sounds pretty.  I would like to have that too!  what 's the feeling to have your face dock in your beloved girl's chest?  why?  you want to try?  plz.  it's dangerous.  don't give your heart to imagination, which is going to tear them into pieces...  I could be shakebeer!  hahahah! banama.  hoopla.  aka, dododkee, .  204g4ji3jo4gk6g41u04t/65ku;4sk7ji3u,31j45 l24 is it long enough?  [ssssssss  yeah, I think so.   night night!

						   I bought lots of games.  when I bought them, I was so excited!  I am not now after I took them home.  My mom is not home this weekend, and my sister is not home either.  She is with my mom in a convention in NYC.  What should I do about this behavior?  Oh, my!  Just stop doing it again and again!  It's that simple!  What was I thinking?!  I hate myself!  I know I would not really play them!  How the heck I buy them for?  You know, I've been really out of house for almost two weeks now...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, just keep giving myself excuse, I am sure I will be happy about next I commit a crime again.  How do you want to fix this problem?  how did you intend to do about yourself?  What should I do!?  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!

						   she finally left.  we drift apart from each other gradually, due to my retreat to myself.  it's probably the last time I will ever heard about her.  I miss her.  Her smile, voice, and her impression she left me.  There're not many of interaction between her and I.  Since when I found out that I have feeling for her, I became really awkward in front of her.  She really mature herself during those years!  When I first time I heard from Mr. Costello about her first year in USA, I was amazed how much she grow after such a short year.  She is a strong woman now.  I should be happy for her.  But I don't know, somewhere in my heart, I am sad.  I really hope she would be with me.  I don't want to leave her side, even just like a ghost and she will not notice me.  I feel really disgusted by this thought of mine.  I really did.  As long as I havd this want, I will never get close to any girl.  And I know that sad feeling is probably something else.  It's probably not even about her!  But I know, when I am sad, I think about her.  When I need comfort, I havae a need to hug somebody, that somebody is her.  Now she is back to Japan and going to work in Hilton Hotel!!  Wow!  She really made it!!  And I believe that she is going to be successful!  I just really wish that I would see her last time.  We were never close.  And I know myself well enough that she will never be interested in me.  But I don't know if you know.  My first day in High school in US, I was very afraid.  I don't show much emotion in my face, or action, but I know I am easily afraid.  I am not an audacious man, I konw that.  The first thing that really helped me get over that fear is Mr. Costello.  The second one was her.  I can never never never forget that smile on her face.  So bright, so beautiful.  I like that face.  They say all Japanese girls have that kind smile.  Maybe.  But she is the first I see, and her smile will be the last breath before I die.   As I am typing this, my heart just goes pumping, and my eyes are out of focus.  I know thatI like every girls I encouter who are pretty.  But right now she is the only one that I hug with all my strength.  It's very loathsome!  I hate myself.  I know she would graduate this year, but I still wish it could be next year.  I never told anybody this feeling.  For I don't trust them.  And I don't trust myself, if I really like her.  Or, maybe I just want to have sex, lots of sex.  But sorry, not in my imagination that she had any sex with me.  I just want to hold her, kiss her, put my face against hers.  She will never know that I like her.  And I will never know I really like her either.  I just think that I am emotionally failed.    she is gone now.  wish her best luck.  if I really love her, I should not think about her anymore.

						   I am lost.  My life have never been this way.  Of course, I've only lived for 24 years, I never had any affair, and my only fight was such a joke.  I can find a hundred sentences from all the books I read to point out that I am sick and perverted right now.  And I know I really need help.  But what I don't know is everthing.  I am lost,really seriously completely lost.  My mom asked me yesterday, could I see myself out in this world making my living.  I cannot answer her.  The only thing was fear when I heard the question.     My mind is blank these days.  I don't think anybody would believe me, neither am I!  There must be something in my mind!  I am just too scared to touch it!  I have to hold my cover in bed as someone I loved so dearly, then I can go sleep.  When I wake up, I was in desperation most of the time.  The only thing happens to be in my mind is I love her, I don't love her.  I hold my sheet tightly as she's in my arm, tightly against my chest.  I so want her to be by my side.  Such fierce longing.  But I have to tell myself that it is fate!  It is not true.  I know it's not.  Even now, just by tying about it, I feel heavy in my chest though I know exactly it is not real.  I'll stop now, before it get worse.    happy dreams.   NoNo

						   can you see myself in the mirror?&nbsp; tell me, what did you see?&nbsp;&nbsp; a guy with a very tired physic.&nbsp; he is a bad guy.&nbsp; not that he did anything like raping, robbering, killing.&nbsp; but worse, he did, no, I did those things that after I did them, I regret.&nbsp; I would like to bang my head on the wall.&nbsp; but no, I did not.&nbsp; I tell myself that self torture is not merciful to myself.&nbsp; and a man cannot be merciful cannot be merciful to anyone.&nbsp; what I found out is I stopped.&nbsp; totally stopped.&nbsp; except for natural desires and the things I would not like myself do.&nbsp;&nbsp; but in some way, I know I want something that I feel I could not get from anywhere.&nbsp; no where.&nbsp; but in the same time I wasted so many resources on myself and doing nothing.&nbsp; not one thing.&nbsp; everyday I get up, no goal, don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went online, and it become quite often that I feel I have nothing to do there anymore.&nbsp; I've tried to play games, which is what I went online for most of the time.&nbsp; but I know that without people around me, this cannot last long.&nbsp; I need to find people.&nbsp; but I am so afraid of them.&nbsp; so afraid.&nbsp; even small kids.&nbsp; I really do want to talk.&nbsp; there's no doubt about it.&nbsp; but...&nbsp;   I feel I am still 16.&nbsp; did not grow up in this 8 years in US.&nbsp; I think I face the challenge and back down, back down, back down, and back down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look around myself.&nbsp; everything is my Father and Mother.&nbsp; Those are their love.&nbsp; I can't see any greater love than from my families.&nbsp; I just feel a tragic in front of me is inevitalbe.&nbsp; I could even see the hole in front of me, but my feet just don't listen to me any more.&nbsp; they have their own thoughts.&nbsp; I should get whatwast mine back.&nbsp; it's gonna be the tenth year from my father's death.&nbsp; I miss him.&nbsp; I miss him so much.&nbsp; But I cannot bear the thouthts that I failed him.&nbsp; Totally.&nbsp;   il's been quite long time that I have to confront my deepest guilt.&nbsp; I just can't.&nbsp;   I just want to hold somebody in my arms.&nbsp; I cannot find comfort anywhere.&nbsp; I am afraid of people.&nbsp; I am not an idiot.&nbsp; I am not a genius either.&nbsp;   writing those are not going to help.&nbsp; it's just mke me feel more quilt.&nbsp; oh, well, it's already build like a long wall not.&nbsp; I don't think a build another brick will hurt that much anyway.&nbsp;

						   I don't know if you noticed. I don't like to touch the topic of girl. I might exaggerate it sometimes, but I know I am very reluctant to touch that topic. Well, I have so many topics I do not want to touch, but this is for me is really sensitive. I know I must be eating too much and too comfortable by doing nothing. I feel I am sick. I really think that this solitude make me feel I am sicker than other people. Probably not. I could read to know that people at my age or close to my age "girl" will be a very hot topic amoung guys. But by leave the group life, I feel I am quite a hyporcitic now. I think I am quite becoming the one that don't really know how to show their feeling! I try to use this as a way to express myself. But no one to share with. I am afraid of people, and the more I try to avoid contact, more I feel I am always belittled by everybody. I feel so painful. I need to find a way to express it. I love girls. I mean the one I know. I don't know, but I do long for a itimate relationship. I've grown up, physically, maybe not mentally, well, definitely not. I do wish having a girl I could hold in my arms, I could hold her hands in mine. I could be friend with her. I could talk to her about everything, I mean everything. And I would like to share secret with her. I long for a girl I could hold so tight and with my head touching her chin, maybe a little kiss on the ear. I told myself a thousand times that I am sick of talking to myself anymore!  I told myself, I love her. I love her. She is in the place I would want her so bad, I, myself, however, am not in a place where I could have her. I love her. And she does not know it. Now, she is back to Japan. Can you believe that the last chance I caught to see her was when I was trying to run up a stair in the student center? She is self sufficent now. Wish her good luck and don't look back.  Everytime come across a pretty girl, I would be like so excited and happy. But everytime, I would to say something, I would like to call her name. You know, I did not have a close relationship with her. I know I did not really love her. I know. But it doesn't matter right now. Why bother? I just want a name I could hold down to. I wish a for girl. But I am not in a place I am able to have one.

						   I can't see it.  I think there are people like me.  I am not the only one feeling that way.  But this intellectua thinking does not help me feeling left out, or lonely, or desperate.  I certainly know I am very lucky, I got a great house full of people who care about me.  The problems are all mine.  I can't find solutions.  I look at left, I turn my head to the right, I am scared.  Future is a blank, when I put my eyes forward.  I want a break, but I could not reach it.   The problems seemed so simple.  The solution is much easier.  I could just list all the solutions here.  I need to get up early.  I need to get slim down and tune up my body.  I should not delay anything I should do or asked to do.  I should do what I like and be consistent with it.  When temptation comes, I should turn my head away from it, maybe go doing something I like, or go talk to people to distract myself from that lure or escape from it.  When facing failure, I should just cry, let it go, and keep going.   I should talk to people.  There are friendly and hostile people in this world, deal them accordingly.  Stand up and speak your heart, there's nothing to be shamed about being who you are.  When felt frightened, I've no solution for this one.   I like dogs, cats, and animals, nature.  But I never really touched any of those, I just read from books and other sources.  Their description of their vivid encounter with those natures are very exciting.  I am really into those things, at least that's what I think.  But from I experienced, I know I should not have them.  I have experienced with fishes, no, actually, my mom had, and it's terrible.  This March, I had a turtle from my sister, and they are dead now.  One became a mummy, the other one was buried at my backyard.  I loved them.  But I certainly did not take of them.  Because of my lack of knowledge, I faild both of these two fragile creatures.  And because of my inconsistence, I failed to create my dream backyard, reading books, and finished the drawings I want to make.   My failure is very evenly distributed on my unrealistic knowledge of practicing things and failed to do the follow up consistently.   I feel something inside I don't know how to say it.  It makes me very steamy, maybe it's because of the temperature.  It's really hot recently!  I don't know, I just feel weird.  Something boiling inside, make me very ancious.  I watch every movement myself make.  And I just can't escape the temptation.  I feel I want something to fall into, I know there's a house full of people whom I could fall on them.  But I don't know.  I want something else.  Now I feel I am being to greedy.  I feel weird.
