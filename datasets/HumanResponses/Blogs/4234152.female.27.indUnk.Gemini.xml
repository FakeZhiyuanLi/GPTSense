      I just got back from the grocery store and as I was walking my cart back to the little cart corral and I see this lady park her metal cart (we get a choice at my store) in the middle of a handicapped parking place perhaps 5 feet away from where they should go. That's annoying enough to block access to a handicap spot so I was going to move it after putting my cart in, but in the mean time, it starts to roll. It hits the side of a suburban but I couldn't do anything to stop it unless I left my cart and sprinted across the parking lot....Which hopefully the powers that be will forgive me for avoiding such self sacrifice. But anyhow I get there, put my cart away and go move the offending cart. There is a little scratch/dent there but I can't tell if it was from that or some previous run-in. The owner of the surburban came out as I was leaving, and the lady that couldn't cross the two parking spaces to put her cart away was still there too. I left, but now I feel guilty that I didn't tell the surburban guy what happened. Why do some people have to be so lazy?  I met with someone earlier this morning about a job I had applied/interviewed for before. I received a pseudo-offer, but I had to tell her that I couldn't give an answer yet due to my "dream job" (no I didn't not use those words). Hopefully if my dream job falls though I didn't hurt my chances with that organization. I guess I'll find out if it comes to that.  On another random note, one of my dogs is getting more cuddly. The other one has always been cuddly but now Indiana (Indy) has started to become more affectionate. He usually finds his own place to curl up and sleep, but now it seems to be at my side. It's cute.

      It's raining here today. Thunder, lightening, the whole works. I love it so much! I wonder what it is like to live in Washington where it rains much more than here. When we visited Seattle for residency interviews we walked to dinner in the rain, and we packed smartly an forgot the concept of umbrellas. I was surprised to find how lush and green Seattle was in winter. Moss was growing everywhere. Perhaps it was more than moss....it seemed bigger, but still fuzzy blanket of green stuff everywhere. Anyhow....just thought I'd share. Enjoy your day everyone.

      So I had my interview for my dream job yesterday. I met with several different people all who are stakeholders in the will-be palliative care program. Fortunately they were one-on-one interviews instead of me sitting in front of an entire committee trying to convince them to hire me.  So the question that the first guy asked me was, “are you an Aggie?”  It was a great interview after that.  He apparently was on TAMECT/EMS back in the day (he was class of ’80) so at least he knew where I was coming from.  We seemed to get along, and seemed happy with my education/training so that was good.   The next interview was with the gentleman that originally contacted me about the job.  He is so nice.  He seems so excited about me and this program.  He knew I was interviewing with other jobs so he wanted to ask where I stood and where this position stood for me.  I let him know how excited I was about this job and that it was my priority.  He then let me know that there were two schools of thought about the palliative care pilot.  One is to have someone already within the hospital system head the program, but the downside is that they would have their own responsibilities already, and that they would not be able to give everything to the 3-month pilot. The other, the one where I fit in, is hiring someone new to head the program.  The downside to that is that they fear the learning curve to know the hospital system and such since it’s such a short pilot.  But, the good news is that I am the only person that they are interviewing.  So if they go with bringing in someone new, it’s me. J He wants to hire me, so when we were talking and I would say something, he suggested that I try to fit whatever I said in the next interviews with the people who were with the other school of thought.   I then met with two nurses.  This was tough.  They asked questions that were difficult to answer, mainly since they didn’t like the answer I gave them.  What I mean by that is that one asked what I will do to address the problem of some physicians not liking the whole concept of palliative care and therefore not consult me on their patients.  She wanted to know my plan for this and “what that would look like.”  The truth is that I can’t make any physician use my consult services if they don’t want to.  The best that I can do is let them know that I exist, what I can do for them and their patients, and if they choose to use me do a good job so they respect my services and utilize them again.  She didn’t like that answer.  There were a few questions that I had to tell the sad truth about palliative care utilization in the real world.  (FYI it is not the idealistic thing that it should be.  Yes, it’s a goal to work towards, but the medical world is just not there yet.)  The last interview was with someone that I knew was against bringing in someone new.  IT was really short, he didn’t have many questions for me at all, and he was very difficult to read.  I would say something, then he seemed contemplative and shook his head up and down.  Is that good? I dunno? He wanted to make sure I knew that it was a temporary contract since it is only a 3-month pilot program, but in that he let me know that if it didn’t work out, they would find a job for me somewhere.  He also wanted me to know that I was going to be on call 24 hours a day and I let him know that I expected it and that for palliative care that it means a lot to me to be able to give patients/families my number and let them know that if they need me at any time that they can call me. I find that they find that reassuring in a confusing time.  He seemed to like that answer.  And that was it…….  The administratior/my main contact wants to touch base in a few days and find out how the other interviews went, and hopefully I’ll hear something in a week or two.  I can’t wait.  I’m a bit nervous since this will be my first performance out of the gate, and that I have to prove to the administration that this is a valuable program for them to fund it (aka further employment for me).  Most jobs you get hired, work out kinks, and after 6 months you are up to full speed.  My first three months have to be right-on.  Also I need to figure out how to prove to administration that my interventions worked.  That’s numbers and statistics.  Heh….I guess I’ll figure it out somehow……  My husband and I went out to dinner to celebrate the interview, and when we got home there were police cars, a fire truck, and an ambulance out front.  It turns out that one of our next door neighbors died.  We had only met him a few times, he was probably around my parent’s age and has twin girls still in their teens.  The neighbor on the other side apparently pounded on our door while we were gone, all he could think was doctor and nurse….but we were out.  (And apparently someone pounding on the door can set off our alarm. Who knew?  So the cops were at our house too trying to figure out the alarm.)  Apparently, it didn’t make much difference that we were gone, he had been dead for a while, but I still feel guilty for not being able to lend assistance to the family at that time.  So all the neighbors took this opportunity to stand out front and catch up with each other.  When I saw such gatherings on TV I always thought they were gawking and such, actually it’s how you catch up and meet your neighbors.  We stood out there for a while just chatting, until some other family members showed up and were very vocal in their wailing.  We took that opportunity to go inside to visit.  So in short, I’m sorry the guy died, I feel really sorry for his family….but it turned into a lovely occasion to visit with my other neighbors.  After visiting with my neighbors I got to visit with a good friend from Austin who is town for a couple of days. It’s been wonderful to see her again and spend some time with her.  We sat up late last night and talked, and today we went shopping for a bit, then went out to lunch with her grandmother.  When she dropped me off she came in for a bit to take some pictures of my doggies.  It’s always nice when someone finds your babies as cute as you do.  They were a bit too excited to cooperate much but I can’t wait to see how they came out.  Pumpkin is getting better around her.  Silly little doggie.

      So when you decide that eating yogurt would be good for you, but you really don’t like it all that much…..splurge for the name brand stuff.  I bought two thingies of Albertson’s fat free yogurt the other day.  The first one was bad, but I blamed it on fluke or the fact that I shook it and perhaps I shouldn’t have done that.  I had the other one for breakfast this morning.  I didn’t shake it, but it still wasn’t right.  When getting a spoonful you want it to assume a natural shape when you scoop some out….a spoon shape if you will.  This tore and tried to keep its own shape.  It reminded me of tofu, blueberry flavored tofu. Yogurt that breaks into chunks is just wrong; avoid the cheap grocery-store versions if it’s the last thing you do.  Watching the Olympics last night one of the Russian gymnasts was said to be a diva.  So my question is what makes you a diva? I figure you have to be female, talented, rich, fashionable, and a bit spoiled.  Yes? No?  Anyways I just thought I’d ask.

      I woke up this morning feeling somehow productive today.  We got a fair amount of work done on the house today--curtains were hung, walls were spackled, and towel racks were installed. We are in need of the correct color of touch up paint to match the existing walls so we are kinda lost for now on some work....I just wish the previous owners had left a can of the paint they used in the garage.  My parents are in Chama with my brother, his girlfriend, and one of their friends.  The high today is supposed to be 72 today, I am so jealous.  They probably spent the entire day roaming around the mountains on fourwheelers and feeding deer by hand.  Since both my parents and my aunt are out of town, I have assumed the responsibility of calling my grandmother every couple of hours to make sure she is alright and such.  That's fine and all, but I feel guilty every time I need to get off the phone to get some work done.   My computer is feeling a bit better, however my cell phone is not.  The pretty little display screan is now black.  I can't even see what number I'm dialing much less access my address book or any of the other functions on the phone.  So a broken phone is usually not a big deal since my friend Steff turned me on to the Best Buy service plans and I usually just take said broken phone back and get a new one for free or the price difference.  But apparently, my service contract has expired, and OH WAIT! Nevermind....I just remembered that I lost my original phone...so I had to buy a new one (with new service contract) when Lauren was born and we did just find the right reciept! YAY! So blogging has paid off, I had given up on a replacement phone and was all sad, but now I'm happy and will be getting a new phone soon.  (So if you are one of my friends and I haven't contacted you already to send me your phone numbers please do so I can enter them into my new phone.)  I have dinner plans tomorrow with the Surgery Wives.  They apparently get together about once a month to socialize. It's my first one and it's apparently pot-luck, but hopefully I'll meet some new people and won't feel so out-of-place.  I wrote to RSVP and just casually inquired if I could bring anything or help out in any way....that's when I found out it was pot-luck and that they already had desserts and appetizers covered.  So the lesson I learned is to RSVP early so you can sign up to bring the easy dishes.  My husband says that what the wives talk about at such get togethers is a interest of the other residents.  There is fear about talk of the husband who puts in his 80 hour week and still gets up at night for the baby, or cooks dinner, cleans house etc., getting around and making the other husbands look bad. I'll let you know how it goes......

      So this is my first post, and my spell check is out. My greatest fear has been realized. My computer has been acting kinda funny. When I try to open up Microsoft Word it tells me that I don't have enough disk space. So no typing up my entry there and moving it here. Problem two is that the spell check here has been taken over by an annoying popup ad which is oddly enough for a popup blocker. This is the ad that takes over the window that opens when I try to compose or reply to e-mails as well as apparently the little spell check option here. Hrm....not happy....we can suffer through it together.  So...my life as it is currently. My husband and I bought a house and we are almost finished working on it. We've painted and added some great color to the house. We've also replaced the kitchen and bathroom countertops. We have some touch-up painting left to do as well as sanding down and painting some doors and closet doors. If we wanted to finish up we could but it's to that point that we are tired of working and that the house is fuctional enough to keep putting up the rest.  My husband is enjoying his residency in general surgery and my dogs are as cute and adorable as ever. (With picture to follow as soon as I figure out how.) So now that moving in is almost complete I've started looking for a job. Now the one thing that everyong says that finds out that you are looking for a job and that you are a nurse is, "great, you should have no problem then." I would agree with that if I wanted to be a floor nurse. I don't want to be a floor nurse, I actually want to use that little masters degree I got. To complicate matters I want to be a Palliative Care Nurse. What's that you ask?....exactly, that's my problem. However, my husband may have connected me with the right people at just the right time. I have an interview/meeting set up this next week to meet with several different people at a local hospital here which wants to start up a palliative care program. I spoke with the administrator on Wed, and he had the Dr. that I'd be working with call me since she will be in Canada for the next few weeks. Her and I spoke for about 30 minutes and got along great...I really want this job! I'm doing research this weekend so that I can be better prepared next week. I'll let you know how it goes.
