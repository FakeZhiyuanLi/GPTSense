       ieriz and i had been friends since we were was on my mothers womb but we met and get along when we were both in second year high.we both love beach.he used to drop by in my place before going to school to take vitamins.i really love this.he's my first and last dance sa prom.at the last dance i actually look for him i make pilit with renz to dance with him then i saw him at the dancefloor.that day was the most romantic day ever,you know ive got the chance to dance with my dearest friend and the music was great and perfect{remember me this way by jordan hill}.another thing is when we both went to the beach and we bought beer,we're insane talaga.i love this guy.i really fought every human being who asks me if he's a gay.ok again HE'S NOT.how i wish i'd grow old with you,as the song goes " i wanna make you smile whenever you're sad Carry you around when your arthritis is bad All i wanna do is grow old with youI'll get your medicine when your tummy aches Build you a fire if the furnace breaks Oh it could be so nice, growing old with you I 'll miss youI'll kiss you Give you my coat when you are cold I 'll need you I'll feed you Even let ya hold the remote control So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink Put you to bed if you've had too much to drinkI could be the man who grows old with youI wanna grow old with you" "every now and then we found a special friend who never lets us down who understands it all reaches out each time you fall YOU'RE THE BESTFRIEND THAT I FOUND" for now i think that i should let it burn because its a sunny day and you're not around..i miss your love since you've been gone i find it hard to go on,i get this feelin inside i just breakdown and cry coz im missin you and its makin me blue.can we go back to the days our love was strong can you tell me how our perfect love goes wrong can sombody tell me how to get things back the way it used to be God give me a reason im down on bended knee.i know that there'll always be a rainbow always after the rain..time heals
