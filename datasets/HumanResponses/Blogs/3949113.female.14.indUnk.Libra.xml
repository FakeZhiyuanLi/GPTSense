      'ello, hmmm. British people have the coolest&nbsp;&nbsp;accents and they came up with funny words such as "crumpets", crumpets&nbsp; is another one of the coolest words...along with&nbsp;"uber" and&nbsp;many other awesome words! so, today i sat at home and did nothing, lots of fun, i know. ONLY 18 more days till i go to juneau! i know i've said this like 1000 times but...I CAN'T WAIT! it's going to be so much fun....i hope, something could always go wrong and make it not fun, or something. but i highly doubt that. I'm reading this book called Wicked, it's super cool. i started reading it a long time ago and never got to finish it, but i'm going to this time. i have a shirt that says "Wicked" on it....well actually it's Finn's and i need to give it back to him, what that has to do with anything i don't know....well i'm off. Cheerio!

       someone just told me i am "too random" i don't think anyone can be too random, randomness is fun, it's really boring if you always &nbsp;know what the person is going to say/do next! anyways...it's actually raining today, for the first time in like...im not sure, a while. but i have to go....BYE

      hey -so, today is going kinda slow....but i'm trying to make the most of it. almost all my friends are out of town but Poofay and Bob and ppl and you have to be in the right mood to hang out with them. i really can't wait to go to juneau! i was just talking to Cate we have all this stuff planed, i'm highly doubting that we'll actually do most of it cause most my plans never work, but we WILL watch every Audrey Hepburn movie we can find, because she's awesome...and i get to see Kelly and Molly and whoever else i see too....heh "life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away..." i think more moments should be "breath taking" and "happy" but maybe that's just what i want for me....who knows...so i talked to nookie (nookie is a guy and i just gave him that name so i can talk about him in this blog..strange name i know, just the first thing that poped into my head.) but it wasn't for very long......"never play twister in a skirt...unless a special someone is around." that is very very imporant! never ever forget that! hehe anyways- this girl i was talking to (Mel)&nbsp;a little bit ago sent me this song by 36 crazy fists, they're actually pretty good....so yeah, um...-see ya

      so when i post on this thingy does anyone read it?-oh well, either way it's something to do. i'm bored so i'm going to just type random stff, because i've notthing better to do."i've realized that if i stop caring for someone long enough, they'll disappear..." hmmm...i *wonder* if that's true, can you really make someone disappear? well, i guess if you stop caring for them long enough it would seem like they had disappeard or something or something."Life is pain...anyone who says differently is selling something" i kind of agree with this one, but not fully, because lot's of life is pain, but lot's of life is fun too, like camp and...other things that i can't think of at the moment..."wanting to be someone else is a waste of who you are." this is fully true, it's one thing to wish you had better hair or something, but if you actually want to be someone else it's a BIG waste, and i really have no clue what i am talking about now...
