       Below is a copy of a recent writing by my father regarding the death of our dog Harley.  She was proof of God's sense of humor in creation as well as in our lives.   I had to put my favorite dog, a Bassett/Lab mix, to sleep today. She was rescued from the dog pound 9 years ago and had lived a full and joyful life in our household.  Everyone who walked through our door was her new best friend.  As I sat and held her while she was being injected with a lethal overdose and watched  God "take away her breath, and she died and returned to the dust" (Psalm 104/Great Vespers) Then I took her home an buried her.  I watched the effect of sin take hold of a beloved creation of God.  I paid to have her destroyed to shorten and alleviate her suffering.  At my hands she died.  At my will, she perished. Because of my sin and the sin of my progenitor Adam, all this was "necessary".  I reflected on the fallen world and what I have killed in my 52 years on this earth.  Animals, yes, more importantly, relationships, hearts and souls of people, hopes, dreams, apsirations,.... love.  I have killed them all in one or another.  And I had more compassion for my dog than for some human beings.    Sin and death became real.  The eternal connection and the cosmic consequence lay before me, wheezing on the cold tile floor of the vet's office.  The ruthless reality of falleness was shoved through a syringe into what was a living thing, a joyous beast, a thing of wonder and pleasure to all who met her.  She died not knowing why it was her inevitable destiny.  She died not knowing it was I who ordered it both with a checkbook paid at the receptionist and by my sin and participation in Adam who brought this damned order into the creation.    What did I realize by this death? What will save us from death?  What heals this loss?  What will bring life?  No amount of punishment will bring life.  No amount of retribution will restore love.  Repentance heals the broken heart. Repentance restores what was killed by sin. Forgiveness re-unites and breathes life into the carcass of the wounded and broken relationships willfully killed by sin.    "A broken and contrite heart God will not depise"....  Will He accept my heart broken by bringing death to my beloved dog?  Will He accept my contrition for all my sins that I have realized while sitting watching my dog gasp her last dying breath?  The world is fallen.  I, by my sin, drag it down even further each moment.  Death is in my hands.  Life is in His hands.  I turn to Him, the one who gave life and I repent in sackcloth and ashes for my hardness of heart, for the death I have wrought.  I pray that in That Day, when "all things in the heavens and on the earth are summed up in Christ" that the love shared between even an animal and its lover will be renewed, recreated and restored in the new heaven and new earth. peace, s-p

      Things got better today.  I'm planning the big "talk" soon.  Still not sure exactly what to say yet.  But I am sure it will come to me.  It always does. You know, you can leave comments of your own on this thing.  So let me know you're out there people.

      ...is SO hard when you actually WANT to be with the girl.  Needless to say I have been sweating a lot lately.  There's so much to tell and no time to write.  Tomorrow (Saturday May 29th) is my 25th birthday.  Dang.  25.  More as soon as I can. peace

      Life is all about experience.  When I was a pissed off adolescent (yesterday) it never once occurred to me that maybe all these adults really do know what they're talking about.  It never occurred to me that maybe they too went through the same crap I did and perhaps had found solutions to life's mysteries.  It just never occurred to me.    Now here I am getting ready to pack up the car with my girlfriend and go drive to spend time with her family. (Please pause from reading and go watch the movie  Meet the Parents. ) Now you know what I have to look forward to.  So what  does this have to do with experience?   Not too long ago I was asked to address the Board of Trustees of Hellenic College and Holy Cross as the new SGA President.  I was ridiculously nervous about the whole ordeal.  Imagine a large conference room full of suits and dignitaries from all over the country who have been listening to report after report all day.  Now enter this 25 yr old "kid" who wants to talk to them.  Yeah.  So all these thoughts were running around in my head.  What if I trip?  What if I get up there and can't think of anything to say?  What if I say something stupid? What if I have something on my face? What if? What if? What if?    But I did it.  And not only was I fine, but I even received a million compliments afterwards.  I met and shook the hands of so many "important people" that I could have been running for president of the USA.  The point is I did it despite all the what ifs. The same thing happens with chanting.  I seriously, without exaggeration, feel like puking before I chant something solo.  My time comes and I honestly have no clue what I'm doing and somehow the instant I open my mouth the sound comes out beautifully.  To bring it all back, these and other experiences have been times when I have been full of doubt, low self-esteem, minimum confidence, and yet I just did it. (sorry NIKE)  The guy in Meet The Parents was a shmuck.  I am not.  I know in the end that I will be fine.  The times of trial I've had up to this day have proven that to me.  So I guess I'll either be typing my next post in the safe confines of the Village or from a lonely bus stop somewhere in the middle of Ohio borrowing the laptop of some well to do college undergrad who just decided to bus across the country.  take it easy folks.

      My dad is a character.  If you believe in the "like father like son" mantra and you know me, then this should come as no surprise.  This morning we're chatting online and he tells me he had the shittiest day of his life, literally.  Being the posterboy concerned son that I am, I freak out and think that he was serious and maybe his dad died, or the house burnt down, or his guitars spontaneously combusted.  No.  By "shitty" he really meant "poopiest" "crappiest", the day with the most fesces involved.  Now before you click that X please bear with me.   We have a house with a basement bathroom.  This requires a sump pump.  Your goods are deposited into a tank whereby they are pumped up to the main sewage level.  Sometimes these pumps break.  The only other pump breaking that I can possibly imagine as being worse are those giant oil pumps in Saudi Arabia that shoot flames like 1,000 feet into the sky.  That would suck.  The sump pump breaking is a strong second.  Yep.  It broke.  If you've ever wondered why plumbers charge so much, try fixing your own broken sump pump one day and you'll understand.  It's tantamount to, well, swimming in shit.  So my dad, being the iconic mister-fix-it that he is, did just that.  He fixed it.   What could be worse then a sump pump breaking?  How about a sump pump breaking and a toilet clogging all in one day?  That's right.  The upstairs toiled clogged and leaked into the floor which also serves as the ceiling for my dad's bedroom.  Needless to say, he slept on the couch that night.  To make matters worse one of our 100 dogs (I swear we only had 2 last time I was there) decided to lick my dad's face all night with the same tongue he probably uses to...well, I think that's enough detail.     Anyway, this goes out to my dad.  Thanks for going through all that, and then getting up in the morning to go to work.

      here i am doing what i do best. procrastinating. see my list of things to do by tomorrow.   there is a serious sense of nostalgia and emotion whenever I go on one of these "moves." I'm saying goodbye to Boston and hello to the Village, via New York, and Ohio.   Wow. The Village.  It's been awhile.  So many emotions surrounding that place.  To be frank, I intend to do nothing but focus on my job as a counselor, but dammit I'm gonna have fun doin it.  No, I haven't really done that in the past.  We'll see. peace

      So here's what I have to do within the next 24 hours.  I have to clean my room, like CLEAN it; move my refridgerator over to Elenie's room; do laundry; pack; get checked out of my room; get my pants fixed (don't ask); get a new phone; and a bagillion other things.  Good grief.  Then we're driivng to New York, then to Ohio, and then to the Village.  yah right.

      Hey kids.  So I actually got my butt up for Liturgy today.  Sts. Constantine and Helen.  Someone mentioned it starting at 730 so I went according to that.  Turns out it started at 630 and I walked in to hear the end of the Liturgy.  Great.  Just great.     Happy Feast Day for Elenie!! (pronounced "uh lenny", like "a penny")   You ever look at someone and all you can think of is, "Wow."?  Ok so my eyes are a bit googly right now.

      went to vespers again tonight.  some people in church are definitely there for different reasons than me.  tonight i was there to watch the deacons.  i know. i know.  we don't go to church for entertainment.  my point is my friend was obviously attempting to pray, figure out what was being said, what it means, etc.  me on the other hand, i was busy counting how many times the deacon censes a certain icon.  oh well.  maybe liturgy will be better tomorrow.      I'm supposed to greet some Lutheran pastor from the area who is falling in love with the Church.  I hope I do it justice.  My dad is good at that thing.  The least I can do is make him feel comfortable.   In a matter of weeks I will be expected to get up at 630 again every morning and go go go go til 1130/midnight all the way until August.  sheesh.  I dont know if I'm up for it again.  2 years is a long time to get lazy.   I know what you're thinkin.  Haven't I been doing that here at school?  Yes and no.  Nuff said.  I'm lazy.  There's nothing else to it.  Surprised?  Didn't think so.    I love seeing rays of sunlight revealed via incense in the chapel.  Just thought I'd share that random thought.  Guess I was paying attention to something else after all. peace

      So this morning I got up and received a telephone call from Elenie.  Some of us went to Martin's cafe in Brookline for a feast day breakfast.  Martin's is this little cafe in the heart of Brookline Village.  By little I mean, my dorm room is bigger.  The size is one thing that adds to the appeal of the place.  About as wide as two short guys could stretch their hands across, divided in half by the counter seating.  Behind the counter, a grill, stainless steal ventilation, shelves of food, (mostly eggs), a small back room, 3 two person tables and 4 four person tables.  It's usually not staffed by more than 3 people, obviously family.  There are pictures and plaques on the wall indicating that is also cherished by others.  Firemen, police, Madonna.  I love it.  It's home.    It's also owned by Albanian Orthodox.  I absolutely love coincidentally becoming involved in someone's life because of the Church.  The Church, like this cafe, is the best kept secret in the world.  For me personally, I hesitate to tell people about this cafe because I like the escape it provides.  Good vibes.  Good people.  Then I come to realize that they're Orthodox.  What a wonderful thing!    Though it's the best kept secret, the Church is everywhere.  It's this secret that we want everyone to be in on, and yet...shhhhhhhhhh...it's a secret!  It's home too.    The sun is shining today.  It feels like Arizona.  I miss Arizona.  There is no place on earth like that desert.  And obviously, there is no place like home.  Whenever I think of home I think of the movie Gods and Generals.  General Robert E. Lee, (not the white supremacist icon) but the REAL General Lee, was fighting for his home.  My factual historical memory is horrible.  Where was it?  Georgia?  Carolina?  Virgina!  Yes. Thank you.  Virginia.  Robert Duvall played an amazing homesick General Lee who elevated Virginia to such a utopic status.  My home isn't perfect, but it's perfect for me.    In a few days I will be in Elenie's home, of which she hasn't been able to talk about anything else in the past month.  I can't wait to meet everyone, to experience someone else's home.  I live for meeting new people and seeing new places, especially someone so meaningful to me.  It should also prove to be a pivotal time in our relationship.  Keep us in your prayers!   Leaving Hellenic, and Polemanakos is always so bittersweet.  We love it here and yet we cannot wait to leave.  Pray for us.

      So today I started my new attempt at a "blog." So the first question that you have to ask is, "Who in their right mind really wants to hear Jesse's BS?" And be assured, it is BS.  Well, if you're readin this, then the answer is, YOU!  So let's begin.  So anyway, the past few nights have been very surreal for me.  I've been having lots of strange, scary, mysterious dreams.  Everything from being bitten by scorpions to finding my mother dead in bed.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Then last night I sort of brought the surrealism upon myself as I stayed up all night hell bent on fixing my computer.  And I'm sure you know what all nighters can do to a person.  I feel somewhat obliged to pull them now and then considering that I AM in college.    Today I went on an amazing date with Elenie.  She is my all time favorite person in the whole world.  The amazingness of the date was in the fact that it was 100% spontaneous.  In the middle of Vespers we lean to each other and whisper about how incredibly hungry we are, and hey let's go eat afterwards.  Well, just eats turned into eats, walking around, listening to music, and seeing a movie.  Brilliant.     Today I also met with Alex M. the outgoing HCHC SGA president.  What a fine man he is.  Such wisdom and knowledge.  Very insightful.  I wish I could have him by my side throughout the year.  But I can't.  It's my turn.  I have an amazing executive board.  Completely competent and ready to man the frontlines if I asked them to.  Wow.  To have authority over people like that is something I always wanted to experience.  Now that I have it, I feel a sense of duty to cherish it and protect it.  We are going into battle.  Make no mistake.  Some of you won't come back alive.  (more coming soon....)

      I'm a little frustrated.  Don't worry.  I'm fine.  And I'll be fine.  All is well.  I'm just short on sleep and when I am tired I get irritable and the slightest thing annoys me.  Like as I am typing this there is a number of girls in the background speaking with their best valley girl accents and saying "like" every like 5 minutes.  My campers are fine.  Funny.  Most counselor's source of frustration is their campers.  Not me.  Mine are great.  No worries.   Part of it is missing all my amenities of Boston and realizing that I am better off without them.  No regular computer access, no down time, no private room to lock myself in, no subway to get on and go into town.     I also miss Elenie.  I'm sure you know that.  That's a given and you might even be tired of hearing about it.  But it's like my foot got cut off and I'm expected to keep going without it.  Again, I know I'll be fine.  I really could use a huge hug from her though.     Ok.  Enough whining.  We go on the overnight tonight.  I love sleeping under the stars.  I am looking forward to it.     Quote of the day is brought to you by Fr. David Kongai at Holy Cross Seminary via Elenie to me, "He who has not travelled still thinks his mother is the best cook."  Peace.

      Yep.  I'm still at camp.  You can get used to that for awhile.  This session I have 14 yr. old boys.  But despite the less than desireable age range, they are suprisingly very well behaved.  Yesterday was by far, the BEST arrival day of my Village career.  The sun was shining.  All my guys came within an hour of each other.  We were way ahead of schedule.  I couldn't ask for more.  Today we blessed the camp.  I love that.  I love that blessing something isn't "magic."  The world was already good.  We're not making it good.  We're just giving it back to God.  that's our job.  nothing else. Yep.  I still miss Elenie.  How does one go from every single day to completely cut off.  I'm addicted to Elenie and I was forced to give her up cold turkey.   Hello.  My name is Jesse Robinson and it's been 2 weeks and 1 day since my last hug from Elenie.  The thing is, I want to fall off this wagon.  =(  Oh well.

      So I am entering the mid point of staff training week.  I have little to no free time.  Elenie will attest to that. (more on her later)  Ropes Course training was a blast.   i jumped off a 30 foot tall telephone pole.  Yeah.  I'm a bad ass.   Anyway, the team here is great.  Training is hard, but I'm so glad to be here.  Why I was considering doing something else?  I have no clue. So it's probably blatently obvious that I miss Elenie so much that it hurts.  I went from spending nine months straight with my best friend in the whole world to nothing at all.  Sad.  I miss her.  More later..... time for church

      Yes folks that's right!  I did it!  I sat down with dad and had THE TALK.  Long story short, I said, "I'm head over heels in love with your daughter.  She's my best friend.  I want to make her happy." His response in short, "You have our blessing."   Alright.  Everyone together.  Deep breath in....and....AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!  That feels so much better.  What a weight off the shoulders.  anyway, all is well.  More details at a later date.

      Ok so this session I had 11 yr. olds.  Six of them.  Half of them started out homesick.  Well we've since broken them of that and now they are free to be themselves.  Especially when a mouse decides to set back the progress we've made over the past couple of weeks.     Let me explain.  We're all in the cabin getting ready for bed.  Showers, bathroom, teeth brushing, etc. etc.  There is one kid who I constantly have to harp on to keep him from picking on this other kid.  Not really picking on so much as bothering.  Anyway, he was doing it again and I had to talk to him.  He hates being talked to so he constantly tries to get out of it.  So last night he goes, "Oh look.  A mouse." I say,"Yeah right."  Then the other boys start screaming and sure enough, there goes the biggest mouse I have ever seen in my life.     Let me explain.  I've seen some BIG mice in my day.  Two years ago in cabin 48 (oldest boys) we spent our session trying to outwit and outsmart what is now referred to as "Mighty Mouse." He was quick.  He was strong.  And it's been rumored that he could, yes, fly.  Anyway, the mouse last night gave birth to Mighty Mouse.     I digress.  I see the mouse and instantly shout, "Get to the other side of the cabin!  Quick!"  The only time I've seen 11 yr. old boys move that fast was when someone accidentally dropped a box full of Hershey bars all over the ground on the way to Gimme Shop.  While they huddled together in the corner, my CIT and I attempted to sweep the mouse out the door with a broom.  Let me now remind you that we were waiting outside the bathroom door for someone to come out.  Sammy was in the bathroom going number two this entire time.  Mind you this all happened within seconds.  So as I am swinging this broom around like a madman I am thinking the entire time, "Please God, don't let the mouse go into the bathroom."   Why was I thinking that?  Sammy, while managing to maintain a witty composure on the outside, is actually quite the mama's boy.  I doubt the boy has ever seen a mouse that isn't behind glass at Petco, much less any other animal.     Wouldn't you know it?  The mouse could read my mind.  He was in my head and knew what I was thinking.  So of course he went straight for the bathroom.  All I heard from behind the locked bathroom door were the screams of a terrified little girl, coming from an 11 yr. old boy.  I could barely contain myself.  It was by far the funniest moment of my summer.

      God is great.  God is good.  Let us thank Him for The Village.  So yeah.  Session 1 is over and we are now counting down the session until Elenie arrives.  But on a lighter note, the session rocked and my campers were awesome.  They will be truly missed.  I did get a little emotional seeing them go.  No tears, but plenty of emotions.   I bought 2 new books last night.  This makes me very happy.  Um.  Okay I'm not so inspired today.  Just kind of chilling.  Peace.
