      Its been a long time...i shouldnt have left you lol    Well valentines day just passed and i must say it was fabulous! Me n the man went to lake geneva. I got him a nice lil surprise. Well he felt bad so he took me to downtown lake geneva and bought me a nice necklace and a dozen chocolate covered strawberries :-) He's so sweet I love my man.    Here's the questions of the day though...    why is carrie going to get back with big? dont u think he's gonna fuck it up again?    why are people trying to regulate who gets married to who? i thought this was a free mutha fuckin country? let gays and lesbians get married just like everyone else!    there are so much bigger issues then janets booby! let it go! (more of a statement but eh whatever)    and another statement, i was watchin real time with bill maher (one of my fav shows) and they were saying that porno ruins relationships. Now Im not all for women being turned into sexual objects in these things, but most do it for free soo.... But cmon it does not ruin relationships. How many women know their mans hiding spot for pornos? We know they got it and personally I dont care. Most men watch pornos to see someone hitting something that they may not have at home, i would much rather my man look at someone else hitting then goin out and hitting himself ya dig? He can fantasize about those women all he wants cause u know what hes never gonna meet them and he loves me end of issue :-)    I think ive said enough to incriminate myself, ill holla back lol.

      Man, I've been reading  urlLink Savage Inequalities by Jonathan Kozol , and it is a good, albeit extremely depressing book. It's about the inequalities, and segregation of black schools vs white schools, and public schools vs. private schools. This book sheds light on something I have known about all my life since I am a product of the chicago public school system. It just brings me more in depth info then I knew, and made me understand things a lil better.  For those who don't know, I am going to school to be an english teacher next year and I am really excited about it. I refuse to work anywhere but a public school because a) i know public schools need good teachers way more than private, and b) i wouldnt be who I AM if it wasnt for the amazing teachers that I had while in school. I wanna be one of those teachers.   The thing that has always got my goat, is how schools rely on property tax to fund the schools in their area. Now it doesn't sound like a bad idea right? People who live in the neighborhood pay taxes to send their kids to school...but this is extremely flawed.   Say you live in a poor black neighborhood, in the city. Theres the things that big cities (like chicago) have to pay for more than in the suburbs, like cops, firefighters, museums, things like that....that take money out of property taxes, where suburbs dont spend as much on those things. Then property taxes are lower in lower income neighborhoods so thats less property tax. And get this...property tax is tax deductible, so when a suburban family pays their tax, for their children to go to school they get a majority back, while a lower income family who pays a lower amount of property tax, they get alot less back because they pay an alot lower amount in the first place. So our kids suffer, because of an archaic rule that keeps the poor poor.   So what I am going to do once I become a teacher is fight to get that property tax rule changed. I think what the state should do is pool all the property taxes, and give to those that need better schools. I know for a fact that this isn't only a city thing and that there are some suburban schools struggling too. If we pool all the property taxes and update the schools that are falling apart, have no books, no computers, and need better teachers then more children will be successful. The schools that get the most money for property taxes are the schools that dont need it as much. So it only makes sense to share with those who are less fortunate.   Now lemme say I went to some decent public schools in the city but even going to them, i have friends who went to suburban schools who had way more. They had libraries who's books weren't 20 years old, i didnt. They had history books that weren't written in the 60's, I didnt. They had a computer lab with updated computers, and more than 30 of them, and an actual computer CLASS, i didnt. They never had to share books, or keep their books in the class room and I did numerous times. I promise you though, I was blessed with what I had and the parents I had, but if we could get the resources to those who weren't as blessed we'd have way more success in the black community. Everyone knows that education is power, but if schools can't even keep the lights on, how are they going to get said power?  Serena

      Ok lemme tell you about me and my guys eating habits this week...  they have been HORRIBLE!  we are eating like two bachelors with no lady around to cook for em. For two days we lived off pizza. I've gone days eating half a meal because my sleeping habits suck, and when I wake up I'm usually not hungry.  Its 3am and im eating stir fry....what led me to this perdicament? Well we hung out in Hyde park all day and came back home, but stayed outside and chilled cause the whether is so nice. I was getting sleepy because I had been up all night and got like 5 hrs of sleep. We were planning on going to  urlLink Winds Cafe , and catching the illini duke game, but we both ended up conked out on the couch. I got up and tucked myself in at around 9 and woke up at 1am. Tried to watch some TV, and got bored with that. Since we only had some bad lunch in Hyde park I was STARVING. So at 2 am, I am up making the last piece of eatable food in this house other than canned veggies and soup, oh and beans :-P, frozen stirfry. It was either that or risk my life running down to the ihop across the street at 2am. (there's a rapist runnin around the northside, and it is 2 in fucking morning) So here I am, 3 am on a Friday night eating stir fry and blogging. God my life is sad lol.  but since we're talking about stir fry, lemme tell you about my hatred for water chestnuts. Water chestnuts are the most horrible vegetable known to man. What are they good for? They're all icky and crispy they don't retain any flavor they just sit on ur plate like big ugly white eyes. Next I hate okra, and then celery but I think everything else I can stomach.   welp now that I've bored u to tears ill go try and find something to do.  peace, serena

      ok what better place to hate on beyonce but here :-)  i just watched that nasty girl video, the videos not bad but of course theres a prob with the big b.  first of all her mother must be STOPPED. beyonces clothes just plain old suck. i feel like I have been seeing her in the same sequined feathered bullshit since the original 4 members of destinys child (when she was 16 fucking years old). If i see one more thing coming straight outta the sparkle factory, with cut outs and feathers and shit i swear im gonna scream. Momma knowles has the style of exactly what she is, a tired old black woman trying to live vicariously through her daughters body. the big hair weave and the vegas show girl costumes must go!  i think she looked the best in the me myself and i video crawling around on the floor with a very sleek, covered up look. she actually looked, dare I say it, classy. I have no prob with what beyonce has hangin out of her outfits, but damn baby your rich, at least get some cute outfits!  i remember when i was younger, seen  urlLink here , I used to think all my titties and leg had to be hanging out to be cute. One day my mom said the most profound thing to me. She said that my titties didn't have to be hanging out for people to know that they are big lol. But its true, you can have the assets and show em of without pullin em out for everyone to see.  Can't wait til beyonce gets older so she can realize that too, or get a better stylist?

      Why would you ever want to give up poetry?   A couple of years ago  when I was fresh and new to the poetry scene  Old heads would say unto me  'Nah I got outta poetry'   And in my youth I would say  Why would you ever wanna give up poetry?   Everyones so nice  Everyones so smart  The men they're not dogs  and the women respect themselves  It's like the perfect world!  But no world is perfect   Nice,  yeah nice,  I have been cussed out more times in my life  at poetry sets  I have seen beef started over a few words  someone said they stole  or over words completely misinterpreted in a poem  The closest I came to having a gun pulled on me  was by a bunch of poetry mutha fuckas  a bunch of mutha fuckas who are oh so much smarter  then the thugs that used to surround my set  Poetry thugs, niggas always wanna be in a gang   Smart, as they say in the computer world L-O-L  the dumbest people I have met in my life have been in the scene  Doin regurtutated poetry and when you ask them what it meant  they give you regurtated language  'no no my sisTA you don't overSTAND ME'  The same people who shit on new people in the scene  The same people who talk about "white poetry"  Don't know what the fuck is coming out of they're own faces  They read the front page of the news paper  and the isis papers  and now they smart.  Ain't got no job...  School? I quit that to persue my art!  When's the book coming out? soon...  Will anyone buy it? no cause its the same shit that came out 50 TIMES   Oh and the ladies and men...what more can I say?  I used to think they were my concsience beautiful sisters  Full of self respect and valour  That was as fake as the dreads on erykah badu's head  I seen women in headwraps hoe themselves out for one man  I seen a "queen" of the poetry scene  be nothing but someones mistress  I seen girls suck cock for good poetry  I seen girls say some shit was good, but they ain't know what he said  but he's so fine though.....   The men, don't get me started on the MEN!  I seen niggas be PIMPS with natural hoes in they stable  I seen niggas fuck up to three women in one night if they're able  I've seen a nigga with a wife and kids at home have a wife and kids at a poetry spot  with no regrets  I seen niggas DO poetry to get the pussy  And then make FUN OF doing poetry for pussy   I seen it all in the poetry scene  or at least as much as I wanna see  And when a wide eyed girl comes up and asks me  why I'm not in the scene anymore  next time I'll just say...  you'll see   Serena

      In honor of beah richards. I watched "Beah Richards: A black woman speaks" by Lisa Gay Hamilton (my girl from the practice!) I surfed forever just to find this poem i'm still working on the peice where she says "I could make the seven wonders....wonder". I'll keep ya updated.  A Black Woman Speaks. . .  Of White Womanhood Of White Supremacy Of Peace It is right that I a woman black, should speak of white womanhood. My fathers my brothers my husbands my sons die for it; because of it. And their blood chilled in electric chairs, stopped by hangman's noose, cooked by lynch mobs' fire, spilled by white supremacist mad desire to kill for profit, gives me that right.  I would that I could speak of white womanhood as it will and should be when it stands tall in full equality. But then, womanhood will be womanhood void of color and of class, and all necessity for my speaking thus will be past. Gladly past.  But now, since 'tis deemed a thing apart supreme, I must in searching honesty report how it seems to me. White womanhood stands in bloodied skirt and willing slavery reaching out adulterous hand killing mine and crushing me. What then is this superior thing that in order to be sustained must needs feed upon my flesh? How came this horror to be? Let's look to history.  They said, the white supremacist said that you were better than me, that your fair brow should never know the sweat of slavery. They lied. White womanhood too is enslaved, the difference is degree.  They brought me here in chains. They brought you here willing slaves to man. You, shiploads of women each filled with hope that she might win with ruby lip and saucy curl and bright and flashing eye him to wife who had the largest tender. Remember? And they sold you here even as they sold me. My sisters, there is no room for mockery. If they counted my teeth they did appraise your thigh and sold you to the highest bidder the same as I.  And you did not fight for your right to choose whom you would wed but for whatever bartered price that was the legal tender you were sold to a stranger's bed in a stranger land remember? And you did not fight. Mind you, I speak not mockingly but I fought for freedom, I'm fighting now for our unity. We are women all, and what wrongs you murders me and eventually marks your grave so we share a mutual death at the hand of tyranny.  They trapped me with the chain and gun. They trapped you with lying tongue. For, 'less you see that fault— that male villainy that robbed you of name, voice and authority, that murderous greed that wasted you and me, he, the white supremacist, fixed your minds with poisonous thought: "white skin is supreme." and therewith bought that monstrous change exiling you to things. Changed all that nature had ill you wrought of gentle usefulness, abolishing your spring. Tore out your heart, set your good apart from all that you could say, think, feel, know to be right. And you did not fight, but set your minds fast on my slavery the better to endure your own.  'Tis true my pearls were beads of sweat wrung from weary bodies' pain, instead of rings upon my hands I wore swollen, bursting veins. My ornaments were the wip-lash's scar my diamond, perhaps, a tear. Instead of paint and powder on my face I wore a solid mask of fear to see my blood so spilled. And you, women seeing spoke no protest but cuddled down in your pink slavery and thought somehow my wasted blood confirmed your superiority.  Because your necklace was of gold you did not notice that it throttled speech. Because diamond rings bedecked your hands you did not regret their dictated idleness. Nor could you see that the platinum bracelets which graced your wrists were chains binding you fast to economic slavery. And though you claimed your husband's name still could not command his fidelity.  You bore him sons. I bore him sons. No, not willingly. He purchased you. He raped me, I fought! But you fought neither for yourselves nor me. Sat trapped in your superiority and spoke no reproach. Consoled your outrage with an added diamond brooch. Oh, God, how great is a woman's fear who for a stone, a cold, cold stone would not defend honor, love or dignity!  You bore the damning mockery of your marriage and heaped your hate on me, a woman too, a slave more so. And when your husband disowned his seed that was my son and sold him apart from me you felt avenged. Understand: I was not your enemy in this, I was not the source of your distress. I was your friend, I fought. But you would not help me fight thinking you helped only me. Your deceived eyes seeing only my slavery aided your own decay. Yes, they condemned me to death and they condemned you to decay. Your heart whisked away, consumed in hate, used up in idleness playing yet the lady's part estranged to vanity. It is justice to you to say your fear equalled your tyranny.  You were afraid to nurse your young lest fallen breast offend your master's sight and he should flee to firmer loveliness. And so you passed them, your children, on to me. Flesh that was your flesh and blood that was your blood drank the sustenance of life from me. And as I gave suckle I knew I nursed my own child's enemy. I could have lied, told you your child was fed till it was dead of hunger. But I could not find the heart to kill orphaned innocence. For as it fed, it smiled and burped and gurgled with content and as for color knew no difference. Yes, in that first while I kept your sons and daughters alive.  But when they grew strong in blood and bone that was of my milk you taught them to hate me. Put your decay in their hearts and upon their lips so that strength that was of myself turned and spat upon me, despoiled my daughters, and killed my sons. You know I speak true. Though this is not true for all of you.  When I bestirred myself for freedom and brave Harriet led the way some of you found heart and played a part in aiding my escape. And when I made my big push for freedom your sons fought at my sons' side, Your husbands and brothers too fell in that battle when Crispus Attucks died. It's unfortunate that you acted not in the way of justice but to preserve the Union and for dear sweet pity's sake; Else how came it to be with me as it is today? You abhorred slavery yet loathed equality.  I would that the poor among you could have seen through the scheme and joined hands with me. Then, we being the majority, could long ago have rescued our wasted lives. But no. The rich, becoming richer, could be content while yet the poor had only the pretense of superiority and sought through murderous brutality to convince themselves that what was false was true.  So with KKK and fiery cross and bloodied appetites set about to prove that "white is right" forgetting their poverty. Thus the white supremacist used your skins to perpetuate slavery. And woe to me. Woe to Willie McGee. Woe to the seven men of Martinsville. And woe to you. It was no mistake that your naked body on an Esquire calendar announced the date, May Eighth. This is your fate if you do not wake to fight. They will use your naked bodies to sell their wares though it be hate, Coca Cola or rape.  When a white mother disdained to teach her children this doctrine of hate, but taught them instead of peace and respect for all men's dignity the courts of law did legislate that they be taken from her and sent to another state. To make a Troy Hawkins of the little girl and a killer of the little boy!  No, it was not for the womanhood of this mother that Willie McGee died but for a depraved, enslaved, adulterous woman whose lustful demands denied, lied and killed what she could not possess. Only three months before another such woman lied and seven black men shuddered and gave up their lives. These women were upheld in these bloody deeds by the president of this nation, thus putting the official seal on the fate of white womanhood within these United States. This is what they plan for you. This is the depravity they would reduce you to. Death for me and worse than death for you.  What will you do? Will you fight with me? White supremacy is your enemy and mine. So be careful when you talk with me. Remind me not of my slavery, I know it well but rather tell me of your own. Remember, you have never known me. You've been busy seeing me as white supremacist would have me be, and I will be myself. Free! My aim is full equality. I would usurp their plan! Justice peace and plenty for every man, woman and child who walks the earth. This is my fight!  If you will fight with me then take my hand and the hand of Rosa Ingram, and Rosalee McGee, and as we set about our plan let our wholehearted fight be: PEACE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE IS EQUALITY.  —Beulah Richardson 1951

      The best thing that ever happened to me happened today...  no im not married....yet....NO I didnt have a baby!  I GOT MY FIRST SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY!  I will never complain about marcus again lol. This mofo emailed my girl hillary with a concept to throw my nosey ass a surprise birthday party. If you will notice a lil while ago I wrote that marcus would be doing something friday so thats when I was suspecting something. Well of course that was a big lie lol. Hillary called and told me to come to her house for a meeting on thursday (we manage a group together) and I was up to go. So marcus had hillary buy the food and get the house together for the party. Marcus went through my emails (grrrr) and borrowed my cell to call my mom my sis and my other friends to go to her house. When I arrived there hillary had a sheet up telling me they were keeping the smoke out or something, and then when I looked under the curtain they turned on the lights and there were my friends and fam! I was so surprised! I had a great time and sent a big thank you to everyone that came, and a bunch of flowers to my girl for working so hard and letting us use her place. Marcus got his thank you's of course ;-) and he will get the rest of his thank yous on his bday next month. Ugh I have the best friends and fam. I love em all :-)  Serena

      Lots to say today....  On Saturday me n my girl went to the club. It was my best club experience ever. It was this place called the ice bar and the boolu master from power 92 was supposed to be there. First of all it was a complete rip off but it proved worth it later. At first it was looking pretty sad cause we came real early but as the dj started playing the hits more and more people came in. We were told the couch we were sitting on was reserved but could sit there til they arrived. We were determined to sit there til they came but then they played somethin and me and my girl HAD to get up. Man were the men fine up in there, everyone was dancing and having a great time. And then I met him, my club husband, his name Antonio *sighs*. Boolu played scenario by tribe and you know my ass was reciting every word loud as hell. I looked across the room and this gorgeous light skinned dude and his boy were doing the same thing. I jumped up to them and joined them and did all the different hand movements that go with it. I introduced myself after and said "nice to meet a fellow head at the club", and he said he'd be back for me. I danced with guys, without guys, with my girl, and then they played some jukin music! My Antonio came over and told me I wasn't up on him, and then he did some, get this, FOOTWORK! I coulda died right there. We danced a couple more times throughout the night, and he gave me a hug when I left *girly sigh*. I will go back and hope to see him again lol.  Secondly, It's officially my birthday! YAY *throws confetti* Marcus gave me a couple of my presents last night. I got a pair of camouflage reeboks and a drunken monkey shirt! I love em! My man rocks! You should see these shoes they are amazing!   Thirdly I just had a 30 min convo with someone while at work after he dropped the n bomb in a chat room. I asked what was wrong with him and he said "she's white and dating a black guy I'm not down for that" I let him know that he's friends with someone that ain't what he likes, I apologized for my birth lol. He says he doesn't hate me but doesn't believe what my parents did was right. I told him my grandpa was the same way and he almost lost me. I reminded him that its who you hate that your children will bring home to marry. That's how I was born MWAHAHHAAHAHAHAAH!  Serena

      Hello world,  welp a coupla things...  One of my home boys from back in the day lost his mom to cancer. For the last 6 mos anyone who came in contact with him prayed for that woman to get better. I prayed and hoped and thought and put every ounce of energy into wanting her to get better, as everyone just KNEW she would. She died on Sunday. It's funny, I have known dude for like I'd say 5 years and one thing he always said was that his moms TAUGHT him how to battle. That his quick wits and sharp tongue all came from her. So when I shook her hand I felt like I knew her from day one of knowing him. I'm so sad for him and his family, and I truly mourn her loss. I just can't imagine life without my mother in any way shape or form so I can't even imagine the struggle he is going through in his head. I'll pray for him, his family and her as much as I can. RIP  Man I had other things I wanted to say but everything seems so unimportant.   Peace

      I spent the whole weekend with my lil bro. It was too much fun. He needs to stop being so cute man for real. He's so polite and cool. I just love watchin him in action. We went to the arcade and then had dinner atg flattop me n marcus's fav place. He was so cute, I would put stir fry ingredients in his bowl and he would mix em up. He was so polite to the waitress I just know he charmed the pants off her. Then on sunday it was just me and him. We went to the aquarium and just looked at everything. It was so cool. We saw the dolphin show, and the sea otters, and a coral reef exhibit. It was so much fun. We went home watched tv and wrestled and then knocked ourselves out lol. He got my fav red black and green wristband as long as he told everyone what it meant :-)  He broke my heart when it was time to go though. He was sleep on the couch when his mom came and usually he raises a big fuss and cries, but he was good. And then when he left out of the screen door he looked back and waved and i saw a tear fall, i coulda dies right there lol. I miss him, i really do. We had so much fun this weekend. Next time I have to stay at his house :-)   urlLink My lil bro   but yeah right now im lookin for apts and chillin, pretty slow at the gig right now. Oh yeah I have decided to at least try to start doing the 8 min tae bo work out i got, even though its 8 mins of pure HELL! and also imma try to dance to vh1 soul for half an hour if that 8 mins seems to hellish.   Also I wanna take a ballet class and a belly dancin class at discovery center after I get done with this photography class. ill be fabulous! im all about at least being 20-25 lbs lighter by summer especially if im gonna be spend it by the lakefront *does happy dance*. I'm still learning how to drive anyway since me and marcus have established some things we will miss up this way. Target, flattop, winds cafe, the flower shop, the coffee shop, and that dope thai food place :-) Imma miss em but we'll be back to see em. yay!

      ok now i feel bad  i was just informed by my girl keke that the girl on snl...is black. Man she had a sister FOOLED. She is actually minnie rippertons daughter. Man I feel like a jack ass. She still too damn light skinned to play omorosa and condoleeza rice. They need to get a brown skinned lady on the show, they broke the "one brother" rule, hook up a dark skinned black chick jeez.   *sulks off* Serena

      *edited so I dont feel so damned stupid*  And also, this big house show, looks like coonery. It looks like a house full of coons, a wide array in one big house. I finally saw the standup on comedy central, from the guy that damn show is based on. The guys funny but not "Let's give that black guy a stupid show" funny. Took steve harvey and all of em forever to get a stupid show...eh maybe he's been hustlin forever. I still dont think hes funny enough to have a show, and the show looks stupid. I am absolutely terrified to watch it. Every bad black tv show is a blow to my psyche. Damn director father! Things like this shouldnt bug me so.  Serena

      I gotta believe there is a hell for those who kill without remorse for those who hate and spread hate but do not feel its discourse  there has got to be a heaven for souls that have felt sin and have to make hard decisions that destroy them from within  there has to be a merciful god or we would all go to hell he has to know our hearts  and souls and know them all to well  the difference to me is true remorse for what it is you've done did you do something cause you had no choice or did you do it just for fun?  and when the party is over and last night recalled will you blow it off or will you hold yourself at fault  will you continue to do what you do with no intentions to correct will you look upon the past and change your ways in retrospect  will you let your creator forgive you and then forgive yourself will you do your dirt and let your soul find hell itself  Serena

      ok i got a lil randomness and a lil news, to the randomness!  taye diggs was HORRIBLE in brown sugar, just horrible. It seemed like he had to take new york slang lessons from mos def or something. Every peice of slang he said sounded so FORCED. You could tell he had to be taught about hip hop even. The way he recited i used to love her sounded like someone whos never heard the song reciting it lol. Sanna was great she made me believe she was a head for real. Now I will give him props I can't think of any one else to play the bougie side of hiphop but the hip hop hip hop part was horrible. ok on to things that mean something!  my sisters going to jobcorps! she finally got the call. my sisters on her way to getting that high school diploma and learnin how to fix cars. I'm proud of her but i will definitely be missing her.   I moved! im back in the hp, its great especially with chonte leaving i can be closer to my mom. The new apartment is great but its in a ghetto ass building. Thanks to hillary, qwa, jimmy, and keke though the move was as smooth as a move could be! the cats love their new place me n marcus love it too. its great. the only thing that sucks is my internet isnt covered down here but i heard itll be available the middle of next month thatll be great.  sad news my mom was diagnosed with diabetes, but she doesnt have to take any medication so its not that bad. She got on a 1500 calorie diet and is shrinking into nothing lol. She's so SKINNY! I aspire to be moms lol.  Speaking of moms I took her to build a bear and to brunch with the beatles and she had the best mommies day ever. it was great, hopefully they have it every year so i can make this a regular thing ;-)  man before the move me n marcus were at eachothers throats he was getting alot of work, at work and i was working AND packed everything for the move. it was rough. But as soon as we got setlled in the new place we were right back at our usual love thang :-) Marcus has been really great at the new place, he's been cleaning up and trying not to annoy me like his lil sister anymore so things are great!

      Deep thoughts...by S. Love  Subject 1 J.Lo j.lo has had every peice of ass she'd had in a music video  that is sick  even her current "husband" marc anthony. they did a song together a while ago. *shivers*  marc left a beauty queen wife and three kids for jlo. when someones as secretive as marc has been, someones knocked up....remember solange? right!  Subject 2 Chicago Hip Hop the fact that underground hip hop's audience gets whiter and whiter is because of two reasons. a) black people are lazy, we like what comes out in the mainstream. don't believe the hype and my philosophy used to be out like that and we ate it up. krs just dropped a new albumn with no video how many black folks know? b) underground hip hop is no longer marketed towards black people (thats a big piece of the first reason) when a show thats not a big name, gets put on in chicago promotors dont even come to the southside to pass out flyers. (ur not hip hop unless u go to the northside where all the white folks are) and the black underground hip hop that is a lil thuggish is completely shunned stopping people from going to and being in shows.  sucks when segregation plays a part in hip hop like it does in chicago.

      I remember the day he brought it home...  It was one of the greatest days of my Life. My daddy went off to the emmy's in a tuxe and my mommy, my sister and I all stayed home and watched hoping to catch a glympse of daddy. We didn't realize that they did the local emmy's off camera. I remember at the end all the winners came on stage and mommy said "There he is, I think I saw your Father!". We were so excited and hopeful but we didn't know whether or not mommy really saw him, or if he had really won it.  We stayed up late and waited for him to get home. I remember hearing the keys in the door and when he came in, he came in with his head down. We ran to him ready to console. He said, "I'm sorry guys, I didn't.." and then out of his leather bag, he pulled out that gold statue and said "WIN IT!". Me and my little sister just little girls then jumped up and down for joy. We hugged and kissed and just celebrated with daddy. As he always has done he almost broke our hearts and then he brought it home and we all celebrate.  They have been playing daddy's movie "Open the Sky" on the true stories channel, they used to play it on black stars and I lost my stars when I moved. Now they are playing it on true and I can see it again. I miss my dad, last time I talked to him was last month I think. Been a while since I've seen him in person. Thats why its so great to see the movie cause there's my dad on tv.  I know it's been a while since I wrote cause sometimes I gotta build up the nerve, the reserve, the experiences to write here. Things are going well, I'm still working me n marus are "still togetha" (c) the old couple on in living color.  I do have some bad news. The other day I woke up to feed the cats and only one came out to harass me for food. I looked for storm and he hobbled out of his closet hiding spot. I looked at his foot and it was mangled! We rushed him to the vet as soon as it opened and found out he had broken his toe. He broke it in such a weird way that either he would live the rest of his life in pain with his broken toe or it would have to come off. We think that he caught his foot in a swinging door, becuase it was windy that night. So my cat's toe has been amputated. We get the bandages taken off today. He's been limping around the house but thankfully he has been walking on his foot which is good.   But I do have good news also! I am starring in a play! It's my debue! The play is called ' Aqua Beats and Moon Verses'  and I play Moon Verses! It's a play about two really close friends and every aspect of their personalites and the issues that black women go through. From mama daddy issues, to reproductive rights, to just good music and art. I believe it is a great play and will be amazing. I am really proud to be in this play and I love my cast mates. They are all wonderful beautiful girls with so much to offer the world. I see something in everyone of them that is in me or something that I aspire to be someday.  So that's life in a nutshell right now. I should be back to tell you whether or not my cat's foot looks too crazy or not lol.  Serena
