       Something that many overweight people do is neglect their health. We allow our shame and fear to prevent us from doing something that is vital to our well-being and I suppose this is yet another way that we confirm that we aren’t good enough or as good as others..As a seriously overweight person I was too embarrassed to go and limited myself to only a few visits to a “Doc in the Box” type clinic on the rare occasions where I needed an antibiotic.       I had not gone to a personal Doctor since I had given birth to my Son who is now 13 years old. Several months ago I made the decision to start taking care of myself in other ways besides low carbing.  I started exercising and I made an appointment with a new Doctor to build a long-term relationship.      I made the dreaded appointment and went in for the full meal deal, physical, blood, PAP and even a mammogram. The appointments were split up in three different visits and there wasn’t one that I didn’t have to fight the urge to call in “sick” or make up some sort of excuse. I was scared to death! Scared to weigh, scared to be lectured about my weight, scared that the exam gown wouldn’t fit, I think you get the picture that I was SCARED!      Despite how I was feeling, I went in anyway. The Doctor was fantastic and so easy to talk to. I was thrilled because I wanted to develop a long-term relationship with my medical provider and here was someone who I could respect and had a heart as well. She didn’t judge, was sympathetic and most of all thrilled when I told her that I had lost 80lbs over the past year.       Once all the test results came back, I found out that everything looked great. My blood pressure was still a reliable 120/80, my Triglycerides were 45, HDL Cholesterol 59 and LDL 88, and even my thyroid was A-OK. It seemed the only thing that was a bit off were my zinc levels and that would explain why I would lose so much hair each time I showered. Easy fix! I started taking a zinc supplement and within a month, my hair stopped coming out in handfuls. All was well and I pronounced fit until next year’s visit.      This past Monday I started getting this fluttering in my chest. Initially I wasn’t concerned because I’ve experienced this my entire adult life; it starts and stops all within the span of seconds.I had mentioned it to the Doctor at the Physical but she said that this was common and nothing to be concerned about. It was the body’s own pacemaker sending an electrical signal to regulate the heart and most people didn’t even feel it.This fluttering did not stop. It started on Monday morning and when it didn’t go away by the next morning and I started to feel faint, I called my Doctor who fit me in right away.      Tuesday I got to the Doctor and I guess my first inclination that this was serious was when instead of weighing me, they ushered me into a room and immediately started taking all my vitals. The nurse said my pulse was erratic and my blood pressure had gone up to 130/90. They wanted to do a blood test and check my thyroid since a thyroid problem could cause this and they wanted to perform an EKG. Fortunately I got a great technician who found a vein immediately and it wasn’t even uncomfortable.       The EKG was next and she took me to a room, handed me a gown and left. I looked at the gown and judging from its “postage stamp” size, I knew that this wasn’t going to fit me. She had told me to keep it open from the front and let me just say that that wasn’t a problem at all Oh well, what is a little embarrassment when we’re talking about something as serious as ones health?!      Once the EKG was done, they took me back to the examination room and I waited.I couldn’t help but wonder what could be wrong and the fluttering still hadn’t stopped. At this point I had gotten very scared so when she came in and sat down, I was studying her every facial expression and movement. The telltale sign was there. She had the “serious yet sympathetic” look… you know, the look that someone gets when they are about to give you some unpleasant news! Most definitely not a look you want to get from your doctor.      She informed me that I have “Atrial Fibrillation” and proceeded to draw me a diagram about how the heart works and what is going on. Basically Atrial Fibrillation is a fancy way of saying that the heart’s two smaller, upper chambers quiver instead of beating effectively. Blood isn’t pumped completely out of them, so it may pool and clot. If a blood clot leaves the heart and becomes lodged in an artery in the brain, a stroke results.      All I could do was look at her in disbelief. Inside I just wanted to scream but I just said “so what is the treatment?” She took charge and said that I need to get my heart rate down so she was going to prescribe a beta blocker and it would work within an hour. Then I would have to start a blood thinner (warfarin) so as to prevent a clot from forming. She ordered an Echocardiogram and called in the meds so I could pick them up immediately. Apparently the blood thinner has to be monitored and I must go in daily for a while to have it drawn to make sure it’s thin but not too thin.      I left the Doctors office and barely made it out to my car before completely breaking down. How could this be? How could I come so far in changing my bad habits only to have such a thing happen? It felt so unfair and unreal. Once I sucked it up, I made it to the Pharmacy to pick up my new prescriptions. I know the Pharmacist well and he was talkative as usual; when he saw what had been filled and that it was for me, he gave me the “look” and I was again reminded that this is serious.       A half hour after taking the beta blocker drug (atenolol) the fluttering stopped and I was so relieved. I even slept very well that night and overslept in the morning.      After breakfast that first day, I perused my website for a bit and headed out to get my blood drawn. This technician wasn’t quite so good and it was a nightmare. She poked me several times and nothing! I became very faint and nauseas so she said I could come back tomorrow but I said I really needed to do this today and another person came and was successful doing it on my hand. Again, I was getting upset but trotted off to another clinic for the Echocardiogram. I got there, asked for Cardiology and was directed down the hall.       There were several people in the waiting room, all of which were elderly and I couldn’t help but wonder if some mistake had been made and why the heck was I here? The Echocardiogram was very interesting. This time I was given a decent gown and the technologist was very informative, telling me what everything was and what he was going to do next.       The procedure is just like an ultrasound and I got to see my valves opening and closing as well as the heart pumping. Soon my fear was replaced by interest as he explained it all. So here’s where I’m at… I go again tomorrow morning for a blood draw, I wait for word about my thyroid and I have an appointment on the 26th with a Cardiologist who will look over my Echocardiogram results.      I’m trying not to think about blood clots and strokes and I’m just thinking about how thankful I am that I’ve lost 80lbs, I’m eating healthy and most of all, I wasn’t afraid any more to go and see the Doctor. I’m sorry that this is so long but I guess if one person out there is still hesitating and too embarrassed to go to the Doctor, let me be an example of how important it is to be in tune with your body and take that no matter how scary.

       I was doing some research recently and found a very good psych website that talks about a newly recognized condition known as "Binge Eating Disorder".       It is different in that one who suffers from this does not purge like a Bulimic but eats large quantities of food; the behaviors are:      1) Eating much more rapidly than usual.      2) Eating until uncomfortable full.      3) Eating large amounts of food, even when not physically hungry.      4) Eating alone out of embarrassment at the quantity of food being eaten.      5) Feelings of disgust, depression, or guilt after overeating.      I read that although this disorder has only recently been recognized as a distinct condition, it is probably the most common of the eating disorders and most likely affects 2% of all adults, or about 1 - 2 million Americans!It's important that we understand this because I think that so many of us who struggle could honestly see our own behavior on that list.       I know that prior to low carbing, I could have have answered "yes" to each of those items on the list. Now? Not so much at all. I do have my moments where I may want to overeat but nothing that comes close to what it was before and there is so much more control there without all the angst.       I'm not cheatfree after 16 months because I'm a stronger person or more disciplined! I don't have a stronger will power than others here! I'm so because I am scared to death to take that step down the refined carb road and afraid that I won't ever get back to where I am now.       What I'm still trying to piece together is where does the coping mechanism aspect of this end and the direct result of how refined carbs make us feel take over? I believe that they are just beginning to scratch the surface on this and it will be low carbers who help pick this all apart. We have a unique opportunity to get this information out there and give hope to others who just can't see a solution.       I know that many people who read this still struggle with the binging but know that you are not alone and that you have the tools to combat this. You are much closer to your Transformation than you think and keep getting back on the wagon. You are not a failure and can do this.

       I just read an article about a woman who had reached 480lbs and her skin had grafted to the couch where she lay for 6 years. I can't even imagine.... There seems to be more and more of these stories of individuals getting so large that they couldnt get out of their home, or up off the bed, etc. These stories are written to illustrate the freakishness of the situation but I wonder how many people think of what hell it must be for the person involved? I wonder if they look past their prejudices of how someone gets that large and have compassion for the individual who must be going through something profound to get to that point?       Making sport of or discriminating against the overweight seems to be the last socially acceptable form of discrimation. We've all found that it's so much more complicated than a matter of will power or character and many of us have found the way that we need to eat in order to reverse the weight gain and get healthy. Of course there are some people who make it a lifestyle choice but I don't think the vast majority of those struggling with their weight are just lazy. I think it runs the gammit in that some are really affected by refined carbs, some have family members that sabotage, some have been so damaged in life that the food is their only solace and others just don't have the tools in order to understand what they need to do.How about instead of making fun and sport of these people, we show some compassion and help them get well?      I guess I don't have a magic answer but I do know that I'm going to do whatever I can to help anyone who asks me.       How many of you go out and about and see someone who needs to low carb? Do you want to go up to them and try to get them to give it a try? I've thought about it but never do because it would be rude and who knows? Maybe they already are low carbing or thinking about it.       All we can hope for is that the media pushes past calling this WOE a "craze" and that more studies come out showing it as a healthy WOE that works. We are in a position of helping by being an example to others... maybe they'll see our success and take some hope for themselves.

       For as far back as I can remember I've had one sort of food issue or another and have been overweight.       I don't imagine that I have to go into details to sufficiently explain how painful it was to be an overweight child because anyone who was one knows the trials that cruel children can put you through. To this day though, I sometimes wonder about the adults who said and did nothing, somehow their silence concurred the sentiment that I was not a worthy person and that my feelings didn't matter.       My weight affected me terribly. Because of the treatment by my peers I started to skip school in the 7th grade and by the 9th grade, I had dropped out altogether. The pain of going to class, feeling everyone's eyes on me and receiving cruel comments was far too much for me to bear. I eventually went for my GED and then off to college but I always remember that there was no Prom or graduation ceremony for me. No Class reunions where I could catch up on the ?good old days. My weight and the subsequent treatment from my peers took that all away from me. The ironic thing is that when I look back, I really wasn?t all that big at all yet the impact was life altering.      When I was in college I met my future husband. We had lunch together at school for at least a month and I kept wondering why he didn't ask me out, I knew he seemed very interested in me but was so shy. Eventually I asked him to go out to lunch with me and as we were leaving the school, he said, "you're never going to be rid of me now". I remember thinking what he said was funny and laughed it off but that was 20 years ago, we've been married for 19 and have an 18-year-old daughter and a 13-year-old son.       All through my marriage, my weight has been an issue. It was an issue in the beginning when I was a size 19/20 and it has been so as I progressed up through the years to a size 34/36 (tight). I've been on so many diets, I can't even count them all but usually had minor, if any, success. My poor husband has been on this roller coaster with me for 20 years and had gotten to the point where he was resigned that I would always be overweight. I don't want to paint him as a bad guy because he is not. He has always been concerned about my health and yes, maybe he would have liked to have an average-sized wife to show off but how could I blame him. Would I be so thrilled to have an obese husband? I've thought about it a lot and I honestly can't answer the question, I just don't know.      I have also gotten to the point that I thought I would never be thin, that I should just resign myself to this fact and live my life to the fullest. I would never be able to go to the movies or sports events. I wouldn't be able to go horseback riding or parasailing, or to a hot climate for vacation because I would be so uncomfortable. Maybe I wouldn't even be able to sit in the stadium for my own daughter's graduation in 2004!      I didn?t like going to restaurants because there were too many unknowns. Were they going to put me in a booth that was too small?  Were the chairs large enough? I had gotten to the point that EVERYTHING I contemplated doing, involved me considering my size and the limitations that came with it. Unless I wanted to go through dangerous gastric bypass surgery, I would have to accept that my life would be severely limited.      In April 2003 I heard on the news that Dr. Atkins had passed away from a head injury that he had sustained earlier in the month from a fall. After that, there seemed to be a lot of discussion everywhere about his diet and lifestyle and I started looking into it. I went to the Atkins Center website and read as much as I could about it. I remembered that I had heard several years ago about how unhealthy it was and that you could have a heart attack so I was very surprised to read the science behind it an how much it made sense to me and I had hope for the first time in years.       I bought the Atkins book and started Induction on the 24th of April. Sometime around that, there was an encore showing of Dr. Atkins' January interview with Larry King and I was amazed at what a wonderful man Dr. Atkins was and sad that he had been vilified by the medical establishment for so long. Fortunately before he passed away, there were several studies that came out grudgingly admitting that his plan worked.      Because I had gained so much weight, I could not weigh myself on a conventional scale but found an ally in the office manager at a Bariatric doctor's office who said I could weigh on their scale. I drove 20 miles each way, every two weeks to weigh myself on their scale. My first visit to the doctor's office was really scary because I had spent so many years trying to deny and ignore my weight but there it was, this huge platform with an LCD display that read 420 POUNDS! OMG, how had I let myself get to be 420 pounds?       What would people say if they knew how much I really weighed? With a goal of 185/195lbs, was there any hope to lose up to 235 pounds?Up until this time, food had been the center of my life; I was thoroughly and completely obsessed. I had spent years hiding how much food I had consumed, to the point that I would literally put my spent wrappers in toilet paper and flush them to get rid of the "evidence" or there would be a pie with a piece out of it, I'd eat the whole thing and then have to go buy another, eat the one piece like before so no one would know.       My husband became the "food police" and would continually comment how much I ate, what I ate, and why something was "missing". I only went further underground into secretive, covert eating.      Induction was interesting and Ketosis amazing, to say the least.  Suddenly I wasn't hungry, I had to literally force myself to eat at regular intervals. I had spent so many years trying to keep my eating under control without success and now I felt like food was in a proper perspective. I enjoyed eating but it wasn't an all-consuming thing and I had time and energy to think about other things. There was so much more to life than food.      I stayed in Induction for a month and then progressed to OWL, my net carbs average 25-30 per day and my percentages are pretty right on at 65/30/5 with calories at 1900.  Since starting Atkins I have lost 80 pounds and still have another 145 pounds to go so I am by no means a Before and After case but Im on my way!  Nothing in this world is going to stop me.      If I ever get it into my head that refined carbs aren't poison for me, all I have to do is remember how it felt on the few occasions where I had inadvertently had them hidden in my food. I immediately began to crave more food; I became frustrated and angry and didn't know why. All of the sudden it occurred to me that there must be hidden carbs and upon grilling my hostess, I found out that it was indeed true. There was a definite and extreme effect when I introduced even the smallest amount of refined carb food.      I used to hate myself; I thought that I was weak. I thought that I had no willpower and that I was worthless because of it. No longer so, I now have so much compassion for myself because I never had a chance up against what refined carbs did to my body, how they made me feel. I forgive myself for getting this heavy and now I have the knowledge and means of correcting it.       I'm blessed with the best friend anyone could ever wish to have and a husband that is supportive and looking on with an admiration that I have never seen from him. After 41 years, I finally have a chance at a full life.  At this time I'm building a business as a Low Carb Lifestyle Coach so I can help others by doing something that I feel passionately about.
