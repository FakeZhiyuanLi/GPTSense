      And so he really didn’t call me. Well, now he’s used to not calling me anymore. But he should’ve dropped calls on my hand phone, at least. Just so I know that he’s home safe.   It’s funny that just yesterday I shared our story, and now we’re not in good terms. Maybe it’s just a petty fight. I couldn’t even consider it as a fight. It’s just me who’s trying to talk to him. He seemed to ignore me. He is always like that every time we get into a situation like this. He always tends to be quiet, not uttering even a single word. Annoying.   How can we fix misunderstandings if he doesn’t want to talk things over?  For him, it’s a mortal sin if I am not able to put in the buttons on my blouse the way he wants it to be. And if it’s not what he wants, he vehemently thinks I did it on purpose.  And by the way, let's not talk about me wearing skirts. It’s like me eating the Forbidden Fruit.

      Maybe you would want to take a slice of our sweet blueberry cheesecake story. Just a slice.  after grade school grad, mervin and i never got the chance to see each other again.but during high school,  nagsusulatan kami. as in snail mail ha! :) hindi pa kse uso yung phonelines nun sa cavite e. kaya lang bigla na lang nag- stop,  hindi ko alam kung bakit . there was no communication for some time.   came college years,that was our first year in college, 2nd semester.  nagulat na lang ako  when he suddenly called. even my mama was surprised,  ang laki na ng boses nya! i asked him where he got my number,and he told me the story.few weeks back,he dreamt of me. in his dream, he saw me inside a movie house and asked for my number. he remembered the # and tried calling it, but it was a wrong number. good thing he has relatives in the subdivision where i live.one time, they went to his uncle's house. he immediately got the phone directory and looked for my number. when we were in 6th grade  kse, hinatid na nya ko pauwi sa min.  funny,he still remembers our street name.so  yun, nakita nga nya at tinawagan ako . after the conversation, pumunta na sha sa min .we're both happy to see each other  kaya nagkwentuhan kami  for hours.   we got to talk regularly on the phone. sabi nya kung pwede daw nya kong sunduin  after school. since  ang layo ng ust,we decided to meet up in lawton na lang .imagine, from la salle dasma going to manila!  ang layo talaga! and i even found out that he was cutting classes just to see me. ahhhwww.    until one day, we got to talk seriously. he asked me if i have a bf.i said 'yes'.i was not telling it to him before  kse baka isipin pa nya mashado akong  assuming. when i looked at him, he was crying  na . the reason  daw  why he studied in st. andrews was because he thought that i'd be in st paul.  pero hindi kse ako natuloy dun. kung hindi rin lang din naman daw kamukha ko o katulad ko, o kung di lang din naman ako, wag na lang.  his words were so strong and sincere. i felt like crying too.  kala daw nya  that was the moment he's waiting  kse ang tagal daw nya yung hinintay and pinag-pray .i felt so sorry.i told him i was happy to see him, so happy to see an old friend whom i haven't seen for years.   after that incident,we rarely saw each other. though we talk on the phone  pa din . but my bf found out that i'm talking to mervin most of the time everytime he calls. kaya yun, i told him that maybe we should stop talking to each other  muna .  sabi nya, ok lang naman yun.  he'll just wait for the time  na ako na yung lalapit and tatawag.  i promised him that if i'll be free again, i'll come back to him.   a couple of months passed, november 1998, my bf left me. i was so depressed.i called mervin.i know it sounds so weird but he's the one i usually call everytime i've got love problems.and he listened to me patiently though i know deep down he's truly hurt. but i told him i was not yet ready to start a new one.and he just accepted it wholeheartedly.  at that time i felt so rebellious, he found out from a common friend that i have a new bf.but that was just a fling.i thought it would help me get over my ex.but it didn't,it even got worse. mervin was so disappointed after hearing it from his friend.   i forgot my promise,i broke it. one of his friends likes him a lot. lagi shang tinutukso dun sa girl na yun .so he decided to give it a try.  ayun naging sila .a week or two after he found out the news about me, naging sila nung girl.    i know deep in my heart that i like mervin so much.but he is just too good to be true.and maybe i don't deserve to have him. when i first saw him again,i knew at that moment that i like him but i don't want to hurt my bf then.and i also don't want to admit it,even to myself. i was also confused of how i feel for him,if it's just a friendly love or something even more.   i tried going out with some guys but still i felt the empty space in my heart.my friends convinced me to look for mervin,try talking to him and tell him how i really feel.and then one day i made up my mind,i'll call him and confess everything.   i know that telling him how i feel is just useless. he now loves the girl, they’re happy (i guess).but telling it to him will lighten my burden, at least i was able to tell him that i love him.i know it was too late, there was not even a slightest hope.   so,i phoned him.i was so nervous, my voice was shaky. I started telling him that it would be my first and last call, that i have no plans of ruining their relationship, that i know his so happy now with her, that she's lucky she has him, and that i finally made up my mind and knew what i really feel. That i love him. he was so shocked and speechless.he only asked me: 'bakit ngayon lang?'    after that confession,i never spoke with him again.it was on april 2000 when we had our grade school reunion that we saw each other again.  sinundo pa nya ko nun sa house and sabay kami pumunta dun. it was somehow painful seeing him.i knew he still cares for me,but he loves the girl so much.   i got to work at a call center somewhere in quezon city a few months after graduation.so i had to move to another place and rent an apartment. during my rest days,i went home to cavite. one time, a girl approached me and introduced herself as mervin's cousin.she got my number and told me that he'll give it to him.  kinamusta ko sha  and she told me  na ok naman daw si mervin kaya lang   maldita  yung gf nya. after that we became textmates.he used to text me  pa ng mga pa-tweetums na  messages. hindi ako makapaniwala na sha yun kse seryosong tao sha  plus,he has a gf. he just tried  lang naman daw,e nakisakay ako sa text nya . so yun,feeling nya kaming dalawa pagmagka-text.tapos minsan pauwi ako nun ng cavite,so ni-text ko sha. just a plain text, kinamusta ko lang sha  and his family and the girl.to my surprise he ask for my name.just then i thought that it was the gf who's using the phone. after  nun, talagang hindi ko na sha ni-text ever.    i enjoyed living independently.i tried devoting myself to my previous job.i went out with my friends and we drank and we danced all night.i enjoyed everything for a time,i thought i was complete.there was still a hole haunting my heart. and every time i go to sleep,i felt so alone.i kept on praying to him.i told him, if i'm destined to be alone then let it be.if not, i'll wait patiently for the right person to come.   after almost a year,i was surprised when he suddenly sent me a message. but the thing was, there was not even a single word that appeared on the screen. just his name and #. i was thinking it was his gurl who's doing it. so, i tried calling him. he told me that he just came from work. I asked him  kung nangti-trip ba yung gf nya.hindi daw . he sent me a message because he remembers me everytime the fx passes by our place. nangamusta lang daw sha.    i was not expecting it would be my greatest chance, though i was oh-so glad to see him. we decided to meet in the  talipapa (cheap ba?). when i saw him,i wanted to hug him.  kaya lang nahiya ako so hinila-hila ko na lang yung arms nya na parang super excited ako makita sha. he was so quiet. we headed straight to our house. I let him listen to my favorite RnB songs.too bad her gf dropped calls on his mobile phone so he had to go home.    seeing him again broke my heart in two. part of it was so happy to see him, the other half was hurting too bad.we started sending messages to each other again. but this time it was different. it was something intense. he told me that he still loves me.  i love him,too.i felt so helpless seeing him and knowing the fact he's not mine. i knew it was my fault, I took my chance for granted. i was losing hope.i didn't want to be the reason of their break up.   but maybe things were falling to its right place. mervin just told me that before we met again, his having trouble with the gurl. she's some sort of a nagger. they’ve been having problems before but he's trying to hold on.   i was thinking of having him was something like a great package. he introduced me to his family and relatives. they were so adorable, especially the kids. they thought i was his gf. we were so sweet. we cuddled,we kissed and we felt like it was really 'us'. i felt guilty knowing he was still committed. but he told me to just hold on and he'll talk with the gurl soon.   finally he got the courage to say it to the gurl. i didn't know if i have to be happy or guilty when he told it me. that night, i just cried. he loves me so much.   the next day, he went to the apartment. may 9, 2002, it was officially 'us', at last.    i don't know how i feel even up to this day. even up to this very moment i'm telling you our story. you might be the nth person knowing our story, and i will never ever get tired reminiscing every part of it. its too overwhelming. we usually get teary eyed everytime we recall it. isn't so magical? mervin is truly worth the wait and god's answer to my prayer. we feel like we're new couples each and everyday because we enjoy simple things and pleasures. i just hope we get to inspire a lot of people with our roller coaster love story.

      I, too, don't know why.   I have used this once when tried going in a chat room. But chat rooms aren't really my thing.  Then I tried this one. Maybe this one will capture my interest. Let's see.
