      I've been told countless times that journaling is good for the soul (or something to that effect), that it'll just "make ya feel better".  Well, here goes; guess I'll give it a shot.  How is it possible to hate your life, yet love it at the same time?  I've got a husband that couldn't love me more if he tried (and he does try), 3 beautiful little girls (who just happen to drive me insane at nearly every turn), a few good friends, a decent job...So why does it bother me so damned much?  There's got to be something missing.  I guess I just need to figure out what it is.  Yeah right; figure it out!  Always easier said than done.  My life is crazy-there's always something to be done, and never enough motivation to do it.  No matter the task, I'm constantly running into what I like to call 'roadblocks'.  As if I'm destined to be unaccomplished.  Speaking of which, I should probably go get the kids to bed...

      I've recently discovered my overwhelming interest in home design.  We've been checking into the possibilities of buying/building a home the past few months.  Right now, we're living in a 3 bedroom apartment with our 3 kids.  It's pretty tight quarters for 5 people, and privacy is virtually nonexistent.  The only downside to home-buying (no matter how you choose to go about it) is the fact that our credit absolutely sucks.  So, we've got to have a lot of money on hand.  A.Lot.  That sucks too, for obvious reasons.  Anyway, back to my point.  Ever since we've been checking out these floorplans, models, and everything else, I've started a running mental list of all the things I want in my ideal home.  Then, I got sick of thinking about all of it-getting discouraged thanks to the aforementioned reasons above-and did something I almost never do:  I turned on the TV.  Flipping through the 70-or-so channels of my digustingly overpriced basic cable, I came across what I now jokingly refer to as "my haven":    HGTV  .  It's amazing, I tell ya!  The things people can do to a house...So, I've now added a brand new 939th option to my list of how-to's for homebuying:  I think I wanna buy a "fixer-upper"!  Not only that, but I wanna do the "fixing up" myself!  The kids could get in on some of the action, too, for an even more personal feel...  damn, my mind's racing again...  So, anyway, that's my newest obsession---HGTV.  Maybe I could find a new job if I would just spend more energy into job searches instead of pipe dreams.

      I'm a list person.  I need lists.  It's a sad fact, but an altogether unavoidable one.  To-do lists, grocery lists, expense lists, income lists...you name it.  I cannot live without a pen and paper.  Without my lists, I'm lost.    I try to keep a running to-do list to keep track of the 'major' things that keep this family running.  For the past month or so, item numero uno on that list has been to get the oldest of our bunch registered for kindergarten for the fall.  What saddens me, though, is that there's no check next to this item.  No check!!!  It's not been done yet, and it's already July!!!  Oh.my.god...there are  no checks   anywhere!  Life has just come to a temporary halt.  Time to re-evaluate the list...Yep, the absence of checks is just.  I try so hard to be organized.  With a family of 5, you've got to be organized to know what goes on in this place.  I know that.  I've always known it.  Yet, as I type, I stare at the seemingly endless stacks of paper on this desk.  It never stops.  No wonder I need lists!  I know I'm pretty hard on myself, but this has to stop; the to-do list doesn't stop, so my lack of motivation has to-for sanity's sake.  It's a sad state of affairs when you have to rely on lists to live your life.  Now, back to the lists...
