      I went to the Fracture Clinic this morning for my 10-day update on my wrist/arm, and it turns out that, as expected, I have broken my arm (radius bone). The consultant spotted it straight away, but explained that it might not have been picked up previously because it wasn't a great x-ray.  I am now sporting a new caste, and the old moth-eaten version has been binned. When it came to me getting a new one, the sarcastic South African bloke responsible for putting the caste on, who had just spent the last ten minutes winding-up the patient next to me asked me what colour I would like.  Me - What do you have South African - Pink, yellow, blue, red... Me - Red please South African - why red? Me - (deadpan) because I mostly wear black clothes.  

   Fracture update!

      As a break from flippant, fatuous posts, I thought I would write something that diarises my thoughts a little bit more. After all, I always wear my heart on my sleeve in the 'real' world, so it probably won't hurt to do it occasionally here. I've been thinking about being 25. It's a juncture, and I now have the choice to acquiesce and accept fate and not push myself to do something amazing with my life, or I could grab this world by the throat and really achieve something. I'm just not sure what it is that I want and need to achieve yet. I sure as hell don't want to look back on my life forty or fifty years hence (assuming I live out that long) and think to myself "damn, if only I'd escaped inertia and at least *tried* to do something important". By the time I hit 30, it'll be too late to think like this, so I have under 5 years to actually do something. Everything so far has been a prelude.

      I've found that having a job makes you much more likely to get given nicknames. I haven't ever really had any titles other than my real name in the past, owing to it being reasonably unusual.   However, these are the new ones I've picked up over the past few months: -Manbrose (we used to have a workmate called Manvir. It was something of a variation on a theme) -Brose (the truncated form) -Bro (the band call me this) -Broid (this one, which came from Giles [see link to his blog] is just wierd. I do find myself saying "these aren't the broids you're looking for" as a result)  I think I like being called Am best, but noone seems to do it!

      you will notice that there are some quality baked bean links in the advert at the top of this page, should you wish to purchase your baked beans from John Lewis(!). By mentioning baked beans a few more times in this post, I'm hoping they'll stay there!

      I had a phone call from a promoter last night who has booked the band for a gig in September, but he was initially a little unsure as to whether it was a good idea to book us, based on his concern from hearing demo recordings with the kind of screamy shouting we occasionally do in the band. He said he thought we might be doing ourselves permanent damage, but that maybe that was just his age showing (from his voice he was in his 40s, probably). With a million and one screamo bands popping up here there and everywhere, it strikes me that you would have to be quite musically-isolated not to hear this happening in a lot of modern rock music (even Lostprophets, for instance). At least he said we could make some suggestions as to other bands that could go on the bill.... We'll see how this turns out.

      Have just made it through my first day having probably broken something in my wrist (the scafoid bone was mentioned by a doctor; something in the thumb which doesn't show up in an x-ray). It hasn't been as bad as it could have been, but I guess I'm a bit concerned about my gigs later in the week, and that I won't be able to enjoy them as much as usual. Things go pretty slowly when you can only type with your left hand. At least it's been helping me break my addiction to MSN messenger during the working day, through non-realtime-ness being introduced into my typing speed.

      so, i've finally cracked and started my own blog. I think I was inspired by   http://www.theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4031  to finally get on and do one. After all, every other bugger seems to have one, so why shouldn't I have a canvass for my musings.  Here is the first of my blog-as-a-genre thoughts, and one that I've mentioned to a couple of people recently: Isn't it strange that we take it for granted that baked beans should come in tomato sauce. After all, a tomato is a totally separate plant and there's no reason why the juice of a tomato should form the sauce for a bean. Which bright spark thought this up? He/she has defined how we see the baked bean in western society. Pretty impressive, I'd say.
