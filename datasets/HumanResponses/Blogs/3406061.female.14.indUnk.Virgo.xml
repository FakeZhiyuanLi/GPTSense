      my friend kim sent me this e-mail  and just had an idea of posting it here for others to be inspired...  read on...  If you're mad with someone , and nobody's there  to fix the situation... You fix it .  Maybe today, that person still wants to be your friend . And if u don't, tomorrow can be too late .    If you're in love with somebody , but that person doesn't know...        tell her/him.  Maybe today, that person is also in love with you . And if you don't say it, tomorrow can be too late .     If you really want to kiss   somebody...  kiss her/him.            Maybe that person wants a kiss from you, too . And if you don't kiss her/him today, tomorrow can be too late .    If you still love a person that you think has forgetten you...  tell her/him.                                            Maybe that person have always loved you. And if you don't tell her/him today , tomorrow can be too late.   If you need a hug of a friend...  ask her/him for it.  Maybe they need it more than you do. And if you don't ask for it today,  tomorrow can be too late.    If you really have friends  who you appreciate...  tell them.  Maybe they appreciate you as well. That if you don't and they leave or go far away today , tomorrow can be too late.      If you love your parents, and never had the chance to show them... do it .  Maybe you have them there to show them how you feel. That if you don't and they leave today , then tomorrow can be too late.    SEND THIS MAIL TO EVERY PERSON YOU CARE ABOUT , INCLUDING THE ONE WHO SENT IT TO YOU. YOU'LL SEE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CARES ABOUT YOU , THAT YOU DIDN'T KNEW .    Forward it today... coz tomorrow can be too late...  cute noh?....:)

It was just then that i realized how powerful they are to stop me from anything i wanna do and learned another lesson...DON'T PUT A FIGHT WITH YOUR PARENTS..OR ELSE! Haha but i'm not that terrible to fight with my parents(astig naman ata nun!)it's just that i got pissed off with them...poor me!:(

      Isn't it amazing how a piece of poem can touch a persons life? not to mention the senti people who write lovesick poems!although im not that OLd(Haha!) to understand such deep poems i can relate to some of 'em(some lang ha..) Take for example this one...this is a stanza of a poem by john clare entitled First love(naks!)  I never saw so sweet a face As that I stood before. My heart has left its dwelling place And can return no more.  astig noh?! it reminded me of my crushes back in gradeschool!but true enough thats how we really feel right?when we were younger like blushing when seeing your crush pass by...Uh-oh!watch me...the amazingkat turning into a sentikat!HAha!!!:p

      i just took a personality test at pressanykey.com and i ended up with a personality like elmo... "You are cute, and everyone loves you. You are a best friend that no one takes the chance of losing. You never hurt feelings and seldom have your own feelings hurt. Life is a breeze. You are witty and calm most of the time. Just keep clear of backstabbers, and you are worry free" it says those things....i find it weird!maybe i just don't know myself well..dont u think?

Now all my fellas do you feel my pain? It's the way I feel I know I made a mistake Now it's too late I know she ain't comin back What I gotta do now To get my shorty back Ooo ooo ooo ooooh Man I don't know what I'm gonna do Without my booo You've been gone for too long It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)  [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn) Let it burn (gotta let it burn) Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know its best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over Been knew it was through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  [Bridge] I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)  [Breakdown] Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?) Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh  So many days, so many hours I'm still burnin' till you return  [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over Been knew it was through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  ...u might think it's weird for me to post a lyrics of this song its just that i find this song...truly for a lovelost(which i'm definitely not)i just find it nice :p
