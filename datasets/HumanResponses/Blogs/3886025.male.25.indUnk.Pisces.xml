      I thought this was some kind of new freakish spam that i got in my e mail. luckily i read it and it said something about movies in space, and then i thought for a second and marveled at the technology that spam has gone through, how spam could know personal things about you I.E. affiliations with movies from space.  After writing several nasty e mails I came to the conclusion that this may be a special situation where it might not be spam, still on my guard though I tread lightly and found myself here writing yet another e mail.  All this e mail writing has made me tired, i'm gonna go to sleep now, thanks for having me on board.  Joe

      movies from space ace ace ace ace ace. man, we're like some kind of roving railroad gang.  but replace the word 'railroad' with 'internet', and the word 'gang' with jerks.... and probably replace 'roving' too.

      Baxter(dog): Leave them alone. They mean u no harm.  Momma Bear: They have made an intrusion and have disrespected us bears.  Baxter(dog): On my journey I met one of your kind. His name was Kowato-jo. We became friends.  Momma Bear: Kowato-jo is my cousin. Go in peace.  Baxter(dog): I have nothing but compassion for you.

      I'm about 1/3 way through my first feature length script and it's been fun. I dropped out of this local production in Vegas to concentrate wholly on getting this script done. The production itself was very uninspiring and I feel totally liberated when I was given the opportunity to tap out. It also is a motivator since now I have to come through on my reasons why I wanted to leave in the first place. Anybody else working on shiznit?  Is Chris still basking in the Uruguay sun or wherever there honeymoon is?  Also, if you haven't seen Anchorman then you must right now! The ending with the dog and bear is worth the price of admission alone.  Over and out.

      I thought this would be a cool way for all of us to stay in contact, talk about what eachother is up to, and basically give Space Cadets a forum to free their ideas. I'm a Freedom Lover! Plus it'll help foster this movement that you guys have spearheaded, M-M-M-Movies from Space-ace-ace-ace!!!  I have hopped onto the spaeship and look forward to enjoying the flight! wheeeeee!
