      I just realized yesterday that I've been here 3 weeks officially.  Sometimes I feel like I've been in LA forever because I fit in so naturally, but at other times I just feel homesick...especially lately.  I miss living somewhere I could count on knowing at least 3 people at the grocery store and not having to wait more than 30 seconds at a stop light!  Somewhere I could call up a friend to help me with my internet problems, you know?  Job hunting is a little discouraging  too because no one seems to think I'm qualified for anything.  Apparently church ministry doesn't count for much in the corporate world.  I try to tell them, 'believe me I've worked with the public, I've handled complaints, I can DO customer service," but I guess we'll just see.  I keep praying for a miracle--I"m starting to realize it will take that!  So life here is in a little bit of a lul...but it is still right and good.  Classes start in a week and that will put major gas in my tank!  I wish I was already bombarded with homework (I must be the only person in the world wishing for such things!) Hallie is coming to visit in a few weeks too... what more could a girl ask for?  I am realizing all over again how blessed I am to have you  (my friends and family) all over the US. To have so much love for so many people, and in such a short lifetime as mine--now THAT is a gift worth smiling about!

      Well everyone...I'm finally here! I never thought I'd live to see more than 2 consecutive days of sunshine..but I guess southern Cal really does live up to its great fame.  I have plam trees shading my living room window and the beach less than an hour away. What more could a girl want (a job for starters!)  So I'm settling in, as the title suggests.  After hours of painting, numerous stops at IKEA, hours of trying to then assemble the IKEA furniture, and about 10 stops at Target my apartment is starting to feel like home. It really is a nice place.  Located just a few blocks from Starbucks, Macy's and all the shops--very different from my peaceful home in New York--very city-- very Rachael.  I have been filling my time with things I have always avoided at all costs..things like ordering DSL and attempting to instahl it (are you kidding me?) setting up all phone and bank accounts, and trying to find a job.  I have decided I wouldn't wish job searching on even my worst enemy, I'm not a fan!  So when I"m not job searching or pulling out my hair trying to instahl something.. I am at home relaxing, hanging out with my friends when they are off work, browsing the area shops (which will take years to conquer there are so many), and checking out new churches.  It has been good.  I went to Tommy Walker's church (for all you willowcreek people you know who he is) and got to hear live some of his new stuff--a very very cool experience!  Never expected the church to be small, badly decorated, and so packed with people--but the whole experience was a good one.  It is an assembly of God church so boy do they rock out! Makes us east coasters look really stuffy.  Well, that is the latest. I start classes in 2 weeks (can't come soon enough) so hopefully I'll have something a little more beneficial to say once I am reading and thinking more.  Here are all my new digits for you: Rachael Wiest  130 S Michigan Ave.  Apt. H  Pasadena CA 91106 HM (626) 744-9425 Cell (626) 372-4714  Miss you all--looking forward to hearing from you
