      Ok, so I set this up to reply to my friend Derek's blog and now I feel compelled to write something. All right, that is a lie... this is the first page it popped up to after setting up my account (again in order to respond to Derek) and I'd hate to have an empty blog and make it seem like I have nothing to say.    Big news of the day: today is the day my condo goes on the market. Yup, after over a year in glorious Chelmsford, I have decided to pack up and move back down to the Boston area. With the exception of Derek, all my friends live walking distance to the T and I count the number of times people have driven up to visit me on one hand. Ok, maybe 2, but definitely no toes! I guess I bought the place hoping to settle down there in the near future with my then beau, but things change and you need to accept that and move on, right? Hey, I may even make a profit off of it. I would accept a $20,000 mistake ;-)

      I was at a wedding in NH this past weekend, and I can't help but wonder how many more weddings I will attend before I myself get married. I'm not dating anyone currently, but this getting married thing seems to be catching on like wild fire. Not that I am opposed to it. In fact, when I was in my last major relationship, I was pushing for it myself. But why? Did I think he was the one? Well, it did cross my mind, but I just saw him for the first time since we broke up on Sunday (after the Sat. wedding) and it is amazing to see how far we both are from that now. Does it make sense to get married when you don't know what you yourself want out of life? I'm starting to realize that the answer to that last question is 'no.' So, I don't think I am going to go looking for a husband any time soon, since I need to figure out my own path first.... but I must say, it is difficult to sit there by yourself and witness all the couples planning their weddings knowing how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though!
