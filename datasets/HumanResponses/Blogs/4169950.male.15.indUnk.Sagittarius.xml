						   It was raining, and dark, I could hear the raindrops hitting the overhang of the porch. I was sitting in a woven chair waiting, for her. It seemed like forever, but it was only a few minutes until she stepped out from inside her house. Even in the dark I could see the big grin on her face. She had red hair and emerald eyes the glowed in the soft moonlight. As she came across the small wooden porch I stood up and opened up my arms. She giggled as she wrapped herself around me and squeezed. I smiled and kissed her softly on the cheek. "Lets go, its almost dawn" I said "we have to get there soon so u can see it." She let go and I bolted off into the warm summer night. "HURRY UP!!" I yelled down the street, and she came running after. I ran only for a few minutes, closing my eyes as I let the raindrops hit my face. I took a deep breath as I slowed down and waited for Alex. I head her feet splashing in puddles as she ran up behind me. We stood at the edge of a tunnel under the road, it was light by a small, solitary light bulb. I took her hand in mine, and I walked slowly through the tunnel, catching my breath. I stopped so abruptly at the edge of the tunnel that Alex bumped into my back. I turned around ad stared into her emerald eyes. She lifter her arms, soaked with rain, and set them upon my shoulders, and rested her hands on the back of my neck. I shivered a little, and leaned towards her. She closed her eyes and pressed her lips against mine. I held her close to me and tuned everything in the world out. For those few seconds she was the world. We slowly drifted apart, still staring into each others eyes. I lit up, I couldn't help myself. She saw it and started laughing quietly. "Were almost there," I whispered. I walked out of the tunnel to turn and face a line of trees, I was standing at the edge of a forest. I smell of pine trees and rain filled the air. I parted a few branches and walked forward. I waded through the grass as it soaked the bottoms of my pointless, ducking and weaving through branches and trees. I reached a small clearing, where the rain fell though, and looking into the cloudy sky. The clouds were thinning, and the sun was rising. "Alex" I called out "come on, lets go." She appeared shortly after with a playful glare on her face. She was completely soaked from water falling off trees and I was moderately dry still. I grinned. "It's right through here" I said as I took her hand in my own. We had arrived, it was a small cliff, overlooking a pond. I went here often, whether it was to think, write, or just to get away from everyone else. I led her in front of me and wrapped my arms around her waist as I placed my head on her shoulder. As the sun broke through the clouds small beams of light fell upon the lake, lighting up the area. I felt her gasp and sigh. "It's beautiful." she said. "I know," I whispered. I stared, and after for what seemed a lifetime and a half, I whispered something into Alex's ear. She put her hands on mine and squeezed tightly. "I love you too," she said.
