      I was impressed how even animals prefer local spirits over mass market ones.  Take the story of the bear who guzzled down 36 beers of the preferred local brew.  I especially enjoyed reading that they caught him with beer and doughnuts. It just goes to show there are many different ways to show your pride. To quote a surf band from the 80's-- "locals only"  http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/West/08/18/bear.beer.reut/index.html

      Are you like me in that you tire easily of the same crap that NBC wants you to see at the Olympics?  Now with more channels on cable that they own, you would think that we could see more of the sports that, in the past, NBC has refused to air.  Fencing, for one, is a sport that really interests me.  But, alas, we only get a snippet here or there.  Or, we get to see the men's sabre final only because of the new wireless technology.  What about the American team?  Why not show their stories and build up a following of a sport that was one of the original Olympic sports?  Even after the blunder of 1984, when the first American to ever win a medal in fencing was shrugged, and after the countless signatures on petitions signed begging NBC to show some fencing, they still refuse to do it any justice, and only want to show the same thing year afer year after year.  Imagine if Disney had the contract?  With ABC, ESPN, and all the other channels they own, what would the result be?  One could only wonder. Below is a link to find out what happened earlier. http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/fencing/default.stm

      Ok. Combining franchises didn't work with Freddie and Jason, so why should this work too?  I like the premise, but there needs to be an human vs. human interaction.  I propose that they use Aaahnold and Sigourney to battle it out. http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/15/box.office.ap/index.html

      Hearing the Olympic theme has brought back memories of a bygone era.  No, I'm not talking about the achievements of past great atheletes.  I'm referring to an event in time that only a few of us were a part of.  It was high school band from 1979 thru 1982.  We used to play the Olympic theme at football games.  One person would sport a trumpet with a blue plastic football in the bell held up as a flame while climbing the steps of bleachers to an awaiting cymbal (symbolic of the ever burning torch of the games).  Five band members (usually woodwind players, why? I don't know) would form the interlocking rings and sway back and forth to the music.  This display kind of just happened spur of the moment, but the band director let us do this at many games.  Usually, this was followed by the drum solo-- featuring the band spaz.
