      We just caught an Eighties Band Reunion programme on VH1. Flock Of Seagulls were the featured band. They were all completely bald.

      I was hoping this would still be up. Check out Dr Miriam Stoppard's advice to a girl worried about the size of her boy's appendage...I think she forgot to add, "but you might not be as shallow" as a coda...   SHOCKED AT SHORT MEASURE    Dear Miriam,    I'D been with my boyfriend for four months and never felt his erection when we kissed and cuddled.  The other day we went further. We didn't have sex but pleasured each other, and I was shocked his penis was only about four inches long when erect.  It seemed so small it made me feel ill.  I really love my boyfriend but don't think he'll be able to satisfy me. Do you think it's best to leave?  Miriam replies,   YOUR story reminds me of one of Samantha's Sex And The City lovers. It was a cruel, sad and very funny episode.  Samantha and her boyfriend, handsome as Apollo, are getting really hot with each other until Samantha breathlessly pleads for him to put it in, and back comes his answer "it is in".  Samantha's face is a picture of disappointment, pain, confusion, desperation and, when she recounts her story to her three friends, she asks the same question as you. "How can I stay with a man whose penis I can't feel?"  And, if it helps to remind you, Samantha - after a few more attempts at satisfaction - leaves.

      We went to the pub this lunchtime. Crazy Lisa the Dutch girl had one too many tinctures and said/did the following (very loudly/noticeably):  1) [Bartender hands her glass of white wine - bear in mind her usual tipple is whisky and beer] "Look at meeeeeee! I'm TARTYYYYYYYYY!!"  2) "I'm going to be absolutely FUCKED!"  3) "I love 'Allo 'Allo with that funny English slag!!"  4) [Does a Madonna dance in the middle of the pub] "Who AM I?? Who am I?!"      Stuart: "Madonna?"     Lisa: "NOOOOOO. I'm Michael Flatley!! LORD OF THE RIIIINGS!!"

      I'm really frightened of Michael Jackson. If I were a, say, seven-year old child in the early stages of discovering Michael Jackon's existence, I'd be Jackson-phobic. His mash-up mugshot would represent pure terror.

      Well, I did the interview and met my "new colleagues" (if you can call them that - I haven't got the job yet). The girl is the same age as me, with the same degree (except from Middlesex University) and she's been working for EMI since she left uni! I must be the least ambitious person in the universe.

Part of me wants to go in and wax lyrical about The Best Of Bach, but it's head of royalties I'll be speaking to, so he might be sense of humour: negative.

      Me and Pato saw Elijah Wood in Fopp the other week. He was throwing lots of stuff (books, CDs, DVDs) into a basket - he didn't seem particularly fussed about what he bought - I get the impression he was trying to impress us (the general public) by being a conspicuous consumer.

      Stuart, Chris and I spent yesterday evening beating the locals into submission in a really easy pub quiz. We had to smuggle ourselves out when the results were announced, as the atmosphere had begun to chill very noticeably. I'm not entirely sure we can ever go back, which is a shame as it's a fantastic pub. Any suggestions for alternative venues will be gratefully received.

      I Hate My Boss Part One:  He just approached me to 'tell me off' for applying for the EMI Classics job without his permission, maintaining eye-to-breasts contact the whole way through (I hasten to point out, someone else noticed this and drew my attention to it). He's always finding excuses to have a go at me, which I find quite unfair.

It's my new look: permanent wearing of my nerdy glasses, next-to-no make up (ditching eyeliner was the worst part) and long, straggly hair tied up in a slap-dash fashion. The 'U' in 'U-day' stands for Ugly.

This company appears to be engaged in what at best I would descibe is a very poor tactic in an attempt to sell their product.  Please be aware of anyone calling upon you trying to sell front doors or other forms of home security. Before you spend any money on a product you may not need or that may not meet the required security standards please call me for FREE & IMPARTIAL ADVICE.

      I think I've brought this up before, in entirely the same context, but I had to get it off my chest. I converse with members of the opposite sex with ease (perhaps more easily than I converse with girls), I drink beer, I listen to a wide variety of music, I like football, I could go on but my point is *I'm not very interested in Sci-Fi*. There - said it. I'm not saying I wasn't a fan of (the original) Planet Of The Apes or Star Wars and I can see the interest in the various plots/dystopian-utopian futures, but I just felt I had to confess and lay my abject ignorance bare, as the office has been buzzing on a science fiction tip of late...Does this make me boring?

      I'm going nuts. The idiot recruitment consultant just phoned me to tell me I had an interview for the part time PA job, but that the company wanted me to sign a 6-month contract. I told him that I wasn't entirely sure about the part-time aspect of the job and he said, "okay then, we'll withdraw your application. byyye!". Am I dealing with the most unhelpful man in central London?  The other 'concern' the company had, apparently, was that I had a strong 'editing' background instead of a PA background. For the love of God, how hard can it be?!?

      We watched the Marathon from the (previously featured on tele) bridge over Salter Road yesterday (about 10 miles in). It's a bit of a SE London showcase, but we get a raw deal the rest of the time (let's face it, apart from Greenwich, there's not much to do where I live). We shouted words of encouragement at, amongst others, the oldest competitor (who waved in return) and myriad silly-costumed people (although we didn't see the running cake).

      Martin just mentioned that The Dandy Warhols were his 78th favourite band. This probably means that he's indifferent to them, but likes one or two of their tunes. I've tried to think of contemporary bands whose entire oeuvre means absolutely nothing to me, and whose singles I'd never consider buying, and came up with this list:  1. Yeah Yeah Yeahs 2. The Thrills/The Stills/The Kills  It's quite a short list. Maybe over time it'll expand.

(Can I just reiterate - don't give this address out to *anyone*, even if their intentions seem pure). 2. I don't own a credit card and, seeing as Chris deals with the bills at home, have zero chance of getting one.

      I watched the Take That documentary (from Sunday) last night and found myself remembering lyrics from obscure album tracks. I was disappointed by the overall lack of revelations/absence of three members of the band in interviews (There were too many fat old ladies claiming to have shagged them, too) but was pleased to find out what I'd always suspected - that the acoustic guitar-wielding dancer Jason Orange didn't sing on any of the records. It also transpired that only Robbie Williams sang on Could It Be Magic.

      The Gary Glitter t-shirt has got me thinking. Stuart's DJing partner, Steve, played Rock N Roll Part I (or whichever the instrumental version is) a couple of Thursdays ago. It's an excellent record. Of course everyone sat down. Equally, at one of our work outings, we all got up and danced to I Want You Back for what we thought would be one last time, as we were convinced that, if convicted, Michael Jackson would go the way of Gary Glitter...

This is all because I've been waiting to be told to do Iggy Pop. I'm now cleaning a band called 3rd Force (no, I haven't heard of them, either). 3rd Force quote Mother Theresa in their liner notes.

      1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:  "...the US Government saw the social critique advanced by the counterculture as a direct threat to national security." (Revolution In The Head, Ian Macdonald).  2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  A final label copy of Westside Connection's seminal (!) Terrorist Threats album [Explicit].  3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?  Abba - SOS on Magic!  4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is:   Five Past Two pm  5: Now look at the clock; what is the actual time?  Ten Past Two PM  6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?  Mad Liza is playing something on her CD player. If I had my headphones on, it would be Pop 3 - Larmes Automatiques.  7: When did you last step outside? What were you doing?  We went to Persy Pov's near Regent Street, off Hanover Square (for lunch).  8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?  Al's blog, I think. I really wanted to know why someone burped 'penis' in his office.  9: What are you wearing?  Pigtails, baggy jeans, a lilac v-neck and red puma trainers.  10: Did you dream last night?  No, but I snored. The last time I remember dreaming, it was quite tawdry...  11: When did you last laugh?  Stuart kicked me up the arse at lunchtime. Of course I laughed.  12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?  The walls are lined with CD boxes (they hold 25 CDs, I think).  13: Seen anything weird lately?  A very warty woman on the tube. It was odd. And disconcerting.  14: What do you think of this quiz?  Well, I couldn't think of anything else to write today...  15: What is the last film you saw?  28 Days Later on DVD  16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?  A new (bigger) chest.  17: Tell me something about you that I don't know.  I have six piercings, only one of which is in use.  18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?  I'd bomb the Daily Mail depot near my house.  19: Do you like to dance?  Yeah, especially The Hustle.  20: George Bush: is he a power-crazy nutcase or some one who is finally doing something that has needed to be done for years?  No-one seriously thinks he's useful, do they? Did you just ask me that question??  21: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?  Aretha or Dusty  22: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?  Archduke Franz Ferdinand  23: Would you ever consider living abroad?  Would I? I'm there already. In a parallel universe, I do bar work in France.

      Would you like to see some of the answers I've been given by the record company? Thought so, I'll preface them with my queries:   Me : Have you any further information in relation to this release? ...the artwork suggests that the compilation is digitally remastered but the tracks on the compilation suggest otherwise; no artist information exists in the liner notes therefore the only current contributors are the featured artist and his producer.    Betsy  (from the US of A): this album was not remastered.  this was a mistake made on the package by our production/art departmentt (...) i don't 1930.  where do you see 1930?  later that same day.... i see it in lcs.  i've entered the correct (p) in both rms and lcs.  you should be good to go. besy  No, Betsy, I don't 1930, either...

I get the 'cute' vote, obviously, but she gets the 'dashing, if you were a man you'd be d'Artagnan' option. She's v. stand-offish as it happens, but I managed to unnerve her by  being better at eyeliner than she is  (and she's had a good few years practice, believe me).

       Ben's Cookies   Even very close friends won't have observed this side to my behaviour very often but I'm prone to doing this as a matter of course nowadays. I bought a Ben's Cookie this lunchtime, ate round the edges and then threw the rest away (roughly half of the cookie). I often do this with e.g. packets of crisps, as I've worked out that I could never, ever bring myself to reach into the bin and retrieve said foodstuff. Half the Ben's Cookie, half the calories.   Hated this morning's story about the obese (and dead) three year old - talk about parental fuck-ups...the poor kid was probably on solids by three months ("That'll be a liquidised Big Mac, please").

I opted for the 'let people know what you're currently doing (miss out the great long history bit) and add a comment or two pertaining to where you're living/what you do in your spare time'. Maybe even say, "It would be nice to hear from people". I admit, I've added too much to the 'favourite music' bit (maybe I should split it into genres) but all these people who say, "Life is good!" or "Wasted my time on you people, love what I'm doing now" can get out of my face, quite frankly...

Stuart thought Finsbury Park would be more frightening (you know the score - Staffordshire Bull Terriers trained to collect the pizza leaflets for their sofa-bound owners, that sort of thing). I was more scared of Tufnell Park, and I was right. Old dears can be incredibly threatening when they're "keeping an eye out for the neighbours' sakes"...

      Hi Chris, thanks for visiting. You're right, fashions change - it seems that you're quite the indie-schmindie type. Perhaps we should start 80s-wise with e.g. Echo and the Bunnymen, The Teardrop Explodes, The Smiths, New Order, The Cars. All 80s bands, all genius. Don't be afraid of Best-ofs, they're the only means of testing the waters.  If you want a rationale for the worship of 80s music, go to Al's  urlLink Correct Opinion  blog and click on The Decade That Invention Remembered. Me, I'm off to listen to Visage...

The Man approached me to wish me Good Luck, and *of course* I had to ask him if he had a nice evening, and if he'd overdone it on the vodka martinis. Conversation went thus:  The Man: ZZZZzzzzz. Me: Oh, last to leave, were you? The Man: ZZZzzz (puts hand up) ZZzzz...oh sorry, you woke me up Me: Heavy Night? The Man: ZZZzzz yeah, I was the last to leave, of course and it was a heavy night. Me: Yes, that's what I just said. Did everyone have a good time? The Man: Well, I'm sure there are a few headaches around the place today. I've just carried on drinking. Me: Nuts. The Man:There were these girls falling over when we left, not with us obviously...(relates crazy story about some really pissed girls who fell over). Me: Nice. The Man: We were so pissed.  etc, etc.  I'm quite glad we didn't go.

I decided to watch an episode of The Professionals (70s cop show featuring the Criminal Intelligence 5) on UK Gold (or some such) and was tranfixed by the mean and moody Bodie, partner of Doyle (Judge John Deed, some say Martin Shaw). My obsession with retro men is well-documented (Richard Beckinsale, David Bailey) but he shot straight to the top of the list. I found a particularly nice picture of him in the Radio Times. As well as having dark hair, he looks kinda mean.  Cillian Murphy: I first saw him in (Irish Film) Intermission...didn't take *that much notice. Chris, Stuart and I watched 28 Days Later a few months post-Intermission and he was manifestly fitter. Nice dark hair/striking blue eyes and Irish accent.

      Top 10 Singles Ever, according to TV Cream. This list is astounding:  10 STAND AND DELIVER - ADAM AND THE ANTS The music cognoscenti (and Jo Whiley) might laud the early punky stuff, but c'mon, it was the chandelier-swinging, panthers and Diana Dors era that everyone really loved.  9 INSANITY - OCEANIC The soundtrack to a million mid-90s college balls.  8 PARTY FEARS TWO - THE ASSOCIATES So your mum might have thought she could sing better than Billy McKenzie, but really this was as swoony and melodramatic as perfect 80s pop could get. Did lengthy service as theme to SDP-era R4 satirefest Week Ending too.  7 LEFT TO MY OWN DEVICES - PET SHOP BOYS Gets our vote for the one essential PSBs offering. All the necessary subject matter present and correct of course - drinking tea, shopping etc.  6 DUEL - PROPAGANDA Truly ZTT's finest four minutes, and yeah, there is some competition for that title. But Duel storms it courtesy of that exultant piano break. Did lengthy service as theme to the Lombard RAC Rally on BBC2 too.  5 THE STORY OF THE BLUES - WAH! Poor old Pete Wylie, he wrote one of the great 80s anthems (and did it again with Sinful three years later) but did anyone ever thank him for it?  4 THE LOOK OF LOVE - ABC "And all my friends just might ask me, they say, 'Martin...'"   3 VIRGINIA PLAIN - ROXY MUSIC Knowing ritzy sci-fi decadence and ever-so-slightly-too-complicated-back-of-a-Gitanes-packet lyrics never, erm, sounded so good.  2 HEART OF GLASS - BLONDIE Majestic swirly I Love NY disco with throbbing synths ahoy, and of course, that tricky time-sig middle-eight. But the winner is...  BRITAIN'S NUMBER ONE DON'T YOU WANT ME - THE HUMAN LEAGUE The returning officers have counted all the votes, our independent adjudicators have ratified the result and a hush falls over TVC Towers as the pulsating cinematic pop meisterwerk, Don't You Want Me, is declared the real greatest single of all time by a whacking great margin. Sadly, Phil and The Girls can't be with us this evening, but fortunately Paul Morley is on hand to make an entertaining if diverting speech about how the group were "a bit like if Abba had come from Sheffield". Paul...?

If you're reading this, Resident of Caracas, I've blocked you. You wrongly assume that (a) I'm single, (b) I'm 'up for it' with someone I have nothing in common with and (c) I'd be the slightest bit interested in a sleazy come-on from a weirdo halfway across the world. Go away.

       urlLink *Sigh*   ...I think there are more pressing questions to arise out of this story than, "Why was my daughter advised that she could have an abortion?". For fear of sounding like Ann Widdecombe, I'd like to know if her mother was complicit in allowing her daughter to have a sexual relationship, and if she didn't know about it, why didn't she know about it? It's also obvious from this story that the mother had initially advised her daughter that abortion would be 'the wrong option'. Her daughter clearly needed impartial advice, advice that she had to seek elsewhere. And Life can stay right out of it. One of my main hobbies is ripping down Life advisory service posters wherever I see them. They've no business in letting their 'experts' anywhere near vulnerable children.

(tender exclamation), Cat, No!   Greebo, you know how to enjoy life and how to handle people. I wish you a fine day, today, and always. Greetings also to your People!

      I don't normally do this kind of thing, (a testimonial to technology) because I've (arguably) got better things to talk about, but I feel I must send a 'shout out' to gmail.  I was writing an article for the website last night and tried (and failed) 4 times to send an attachment through hotmail. On the verge of giving up, I remember the gmail account I'd set up a couple of weeks previously...30 seconds later, Pato was in receipt of my article.  If anyone's tiring of the Bill Gates email emporium way, I'd suggest you get yourself down to http://gmail.google.com and get yourselves some 1000MB of gmail love.

      "From the dark ocean caverns of Poseidon to the ravishing beauty of Aphrodite, CUSCO delves into the inner journey of ancient Myth and Legends. Soaring flutes, haunting vocals and an array of new and old world instruments capture the awe-inspired tales of gods and heroes. Filled with adventure. magic and mystery, CUSCO delivers another extraordinary musical journey through the wonders of the human heart and spirit."  The above is a description of what's on the CD I'm currently 'cleaning'. At least Cusco arent evangelical christians, I s'pose. Hang on...  "Soaring flutes, haunting vocals and an array of new and old world instruments". Instruments of...torture? Their syntax is puzzling.

      There are these two guys in the office next to us. They do everything on top of each other, and hang around each other in the kitchen, like me and Pato do when we think no-one's looking. They look the same and wear the same clothes. They're also (a) Aryan children (frighteningly so) and (b) camp as tits. And they speak over each other (like when they just announced that they were monopolising the fax machine for 5 minutes).

Were good for just over a year, at the beginning. 6. Red Hot Chili Peppers. The odd decent single. 7. Jay-Z.

      Common Misconceptions About Me:  1. People Think That I'm Blonde. I'm not blonde, I'm a redhead, which is probably due to my Irish ancestry. I do, however, have commensurately darker eyebrows, like my mum, who is brunette. 2. People Still Think I'm A Smoker. I've had approximately 3 drags on a cigarette in the last nine months. Annual bronchitis is no laughing matter. 3. People Think I'm Laid Back. No, that's not me, either - I just pretend to be.  4. People Think I Know About (Some) Stuff. Wrong again! The stuff I know about is next to useless - area codes, anyone?  5. People Think My Job Sounds Interesting. So far wide of the mark - it's the dullest job since time began. The only thing that keeps me sane is writing useless posts in this vein. And Pato!!!

      From Mad Mel Phillips' blog:  "A story in yesterday's Observer (which for some reason appears to have vanished from its website) says that Britain is to block moves to include a 'Christian clause' in the EU constitution, arguing that it should reflect instead Europe's 'multi-faith and multicultural make-up'. This confirms what has long been obvious in Britain itself -- that the Blair government is intent on destroying the particular cultural basis of British and European society. Yes, Britain and Europe now host many faiths and cultures; but unless they hang on to their own founding culture and its principles, that culture will be swept away."   Hang on, are we thinking of the same PM? The Tony Blair who believes that our education system should made up of 'faith-based schools'? The woman's clearly nuts.

      This is my last week working in the pop music industry. As of next Monday, I'll be cooking up a Classical storm working for EMI's unfavoured black sheep division, EMI Classics. It's not something I often admit to, but I spent the best part of three years in a library reading Carl Dahlhaus, Mantle Hood, Eduard Hanslick, Friedrich Nietzsche et al, pondering the question, 'What Is Music?'. I saw two references to pop music the whole three years -   1. One of my possible first year dissertations was, "Analyse Blur's 'To The End' with references to British Pop of the 1960s, specifically The Kinks and The Small Faces".  2. Mantle Hood mentioning "the irrelevance of Beatlemusic" (that's right, kids, Beatlemusic) in relation to Ethnomusicology.  So I'm ready to become a Moleperson. Don't try and stop me. See you down the RFH after the Boulez retrospective.

I was close to tears yesterday when I saw in The Observer that Neil Webb was now an ageing postman and proud of it ("People get old!!"). I don't really know what my point is..."mortality's weird", perhaps?  In other news, The Farm are re-releasing All Together Now, in time for Euro 2004. Noooooooooooo!!!

      Franz Ferdinand have restored my faith in the power of indie. I was, in my jaded state, beginning to believe that 'indie music' was no more than a guitar-and-stodge / 4/4-driven vehicle for backwards-looking, white, anaemic Travis/Coldplay listeners. Okay, I admit it, the audience fitted this description. 6 months ago, audience members would probably have been raving about Parachutes and digging out their well-worn copy of The Man Who for nostalgic purposes. Franz Ferdinand have pissed all over this, with the help of Adam and the Ants and The Associates. I'm going to stop now for fear of sounding like pseuds corner...

I get the feeling that tonight's going to be v. different. I've noticed a lot of gym-types on my bus in the morning...they're usually the orange ones talking about half marathons and telling their more clued-up friends that they're going to their first ever gig in two months (true story...).

Television doesn't deserve its bad press - and there's nothing more sociable than watching University Challenge with your friends of a Monday evening. 3. We don't need 5 coffee retailers in close proximity (100 metres) to my office. Especially not the 2 Pret-A-Mangers. 4. There's no point getting into New Music. You'll only make a fool of yourself. Wait a few years (until they're old news) before getting into a new band. 5. Crowded House were exceptionally good.

There was this bloke on the final bus (the 10 to Hammersmith) who was a care in the community candidate if ever I've seen one. He screamed down the phone to a stranger ("no I do not want to speak English, I want to speak Greek"). He then sat down, opened the Metro where a picture of Serena Williams happened to be, and started kissing the paper.

Oh, and Emms, I always forget to thank you for blitzing my room after finals, I suppose I (wrongly) assumed that buying you Cadbury's Heroes during your Extended Essay 'mares was enough gratitude to tie me over for the academic year ;)  1. New Edition - Candy Girl. Did I just write that? 2. Matthew Wilder - Break My Stride. Of course!! Of course "Alpro"!!! (Dropping Pato right in it - he bought the album - it's now in Al's safe hands). 3. Anything on Now 1-10, or Now Dance '89. 4. Most East 17. Yes, most of it. 5. Gary Glitter - Rock and Roll Part II. 6. Girls Aloud - No Good Advice, Sound of The Underground, but not the new one.  That's enough guilty pleasures. Anyone fancy owning up to any of the above, or anything else record-embarrassment-wise, for that matter?

I may have been in Bananarama had I been born 5 years later than that, but they probably wouldn't have hired me.   Still, beats contracts and royalties any day...

      Are guinea pigs the most useless domestic pets on earth? They squawk and scrabble around and, if they're lucky, dash up and down their 'runs' trying to find a way out ("they're rabbits who can look after themselves!") and you have to buy them in twos, like you're about to take them on Noah's Ark or something. It's utterly pointless buying them in twos, though, as one of your precious Meerschweinchen catches the inevitable cold and dies..."oh, that's okay, Squeak's dead, we've still got Bubble", then Bubble karks it a week later because he misses Squeak so much (a fortnight previously, the two had to be separated as Squeak lost an eye in a fight with Bubble).

The Specials - The Specials (any album with Message To You Rudy deserves fourth place)  5. The Human League - Dare  6. Blur - Parklife  7. David Bowie - Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust etc  8. The Beatles - Hard Days Night  9. Teenage Fanclub - Songs From Northern Britain  10. Depeach Mode - Speak and Spell

      I love the fact that all the men at work are talking shite about football to each other. No-one gives a shit what anyone else thinks, they're just loving the sound of their own voice. No-one addresses any of their football opining to me, either, because I'm a girl and therefore I prefer shopping, shoes and squealing.

      Stuart's new housemate, Matt (a Sex Pistols fan) slagged off Yazoo yesterday. Unprovoked, uncalled for. Other bands that you're not allowed to slag off in front of me (and, believe me, a lot of people do):  1. Crowded House (as before, ad infinitum) 2. Adam and the Ants (ditto) 3. Blur (too much hatred towards this lot, none of it justified) 4. The Longpigs 5. Anyone want to add their own here?

      I made brownies yesterday, which turned out to be the best thing I've ever baked. I had to walk round Waitrose with the recipe (ripped out of the Observer Magazine) inconspicuously lining the bottom of my basket (in order to avoid being laughed at like the people Stuart saw marching round Waitrose with an entire Guardian supplement shouting to each other across the aisles, "They said SEA BASS!!").  I shouldn't have made them, though. They contain an entire pack of Anchor and they're sitting on my desk in a tupperware box with no chance of staying there, if my ravenous appetite gets the better of me.

      I wouldn't mind the French beating us and then gloating on our asses if they were actually a nation of football enthusiasts, but they're not (memories of ma corres Francaise shouting 'on a gagnÃ©!' while covering her wall with posters of a balding Zizou - in 1999).  Stuart visited  L'Equipe  last night to read the inevitable 'on a luttÃ© jusqu'a la fin contre les anglais' match synopsis, and wasn't disappointed. Santini: "Our superior tactics won out", apparently.

      I just booked a hair appointment. A week on Saturday I shall no longer be a redhead, I'll be a brunette (with red tendencies). Here's to dismal failure.  Interestingly enough, I just got hit on by the hairdresser (this *never* happens). Whilst waiting for my hair consultation, a male who had been staring at me approached me and said, "Can I cut your hair? I want to give you a blunt fringe. Those eyes, I could lose myself in them. You need a blunt fringe to bring out your eyes".  Now, I'm not sure if this was 'the hard sell' or 'can I have your number?' but I assumed a semi-bitchface and said 'I'm here for a colour, actually', so he left it. No point in persevering really, was there?

      Furthermore, my secret theory is that people who slag off the Beatles (and there have been many on my site)  never even got into them in the first place . Admit it, you guys, you're scared of not knowing as much about them as you should (the bare minimum acceptable knowledge about the Beatles is, let's face it, pretty intimidatingly huge). It's time to throw yourselves in at the deep end, buy the Red and Blue albums and the Anthology on DVD and do some homework.

      This probably isn't the last time I'm going to say this to everyone but leave off The Beatles band already!! Taking potshots at the Beatles doesn't say anything extraordinary about your taste in music, other than you're yet to tap the goldmine that is the greatest oeuvre in the history of pop music. You're not allowed to like Oasis, the Roses, the Stones, Bowie, Buzzcocks, in fact any band that relied on the 3-minute pop song without first having established your favourite Beatles songs/albums/periods/haircuts.  Anyone who tries to argue with me will be crucified.

      All my life I've been accused of being an inverse snob. Maybe this is my problem with XFM. I can't let the existing white/indie/male/guitar hegemony lie. XFM in the morning is bad because (a) it treats tunes by bands such as Kula Shaker as important historical documents, when everyone knows that any residual memory of this incredibly unimportant group will be wiped out within 10 years (I hope) and (b) it is incredibly lazy in terms of what it can be arsed giving an airing. So while Jo Whiley tries to educate the pitifully educated masses by playing Superstition (okay, it's a cliche but when most people don't know anything by Stevie Wonder, it's a start) XFM are undoing her hard work by airing Snow Patrol, Scissor Sisters and other such undeserving shite.  How are people meant to know what's worth listening to when radio stations/the media consider Keane groundbreaking?

      Dear XFM,  Even in the realm of white male indie rock, better tunes exist than Hey Dude by Kula Shaker (well, you'd have thought so). And, tell me to fuck off if you like, but nothing is more likely to make me turn off the radio than, "After the break, a brilliant record by the Scissor Sisters"...  All the best,   Laura x

      I just updated my profile (eyes left). My list of favourite music suggests that I have no idea what I like listening to and I'm constantly stabbing in an aesthetic white-noise wilderness.  I've also just been 'insufficiently funded' for about the first time in a year - hardly surprising seeing as I've had to make 9 days pay last a month, run a car, make 9 more days pay last a month next month... I can't help being a contractor!! I'm going to have to give my bank manager a cuddle...

The flyer looks promising - (containing as it does pictures of both bands and labels) - Outkast, Morrissey, Dylan, Prince, The Supremes and Blondie with Tamla Motown, Stax and 2-Tone logos (presumably they thought people wouldn't recognise Isaac Hayes). We'll be there from about 6.30 - Basement Bar (Goslett Yard) off Charing Cross Road. In the words of Al & co. "Should be a peach".

      Can someone who isn't at work (Jane??) follow the link at the top of my blog to the 'Belly Gallery'? I'm scared it's a specialist thing, but it could equally be a page devoted to Jimmy Five Bellies or the like, in which case I'm intrigued.  Talking of Five Bellies, wasn't it only about 8 years ago (8 years?!?!?!) that Gazza, Baker, Evans and Jimmy were the most famous people in Britain? Is there any way of turning the clock back??

      Things that improve every time I think about them (which, admittedly, is all the time):  1. Hell's Kitchen. Loving the fact that Abi Titmuss is actually quite a boring and earnest try-hard, and that she got kicked out instead of the embarrassing Currie. I'm also amazed that Jennifer Ellison is Gordon's 'off the record' star of the kitchen and  looks about 12 . You men are soooo baaaaad.

      Things that are *still* excellent today:  1. Hell's Kitchen. The best reality TV show I've ever seen (and I've seen them all). 2. The Guardian. I bought it for the first time in ages today and there was some excellent anti-Kilroy polemic. Bravo. 3. That Ska compilation which I'm re-listening to. 4. Our new car - despite the parking issues and the fact that we've locked it into the garage for the weekend with no visible means of getting it out.

      I haven't had any good opinions in a while. When you're not talking incessantly at/with someone who shares your concerns and woes, it's difficult to get worked up about anything. So instead I'm going to start making 'to do' lists.  1. Dye my hair. This evening, in fact. I noticed Jane had opted for a particularly daring shade of dark brown this weekend, so I figured that I could obliterate any remaining blondeness with a quick dash of Cappuccino Wash In Wash Out. If it turns out okay, I go the whole hog like Winona Ryder.  2. Watch Hells Kitchen. Don't watch Big Brother.  3. Obtain contact lenses so that I can drive (I'm illegal at the moment). And replace my lost/stolen licence. And get the pictures done.  Thanks for listening...

      Having spent Â£100 on the car at the weekend, we managed to get it to Oxford and back. We hit a snag at the Esso garage on Holloway Road when, try as we might, we couldn't open the petrol cap. Started to panic when 2 Bradford fans suggested breaking it with a screwdirver and "stuffing a rag in" but they managed to force it eventually and we filled up.

      &nbsp; I've had about six colds in as many weeks. Thinking I'd shaken them off, I woke up again this morning with a sore throat and streaming nose. I expect everyone at work knows me as 'the one with the post nasal drip'. It's embarrassing, people ask you how you are and you have to say, "Absolutely fine" because having a cold/being a bit run down&nbsp;isn't being ill. And it's certainly no reason for taking time off, as far as the whole world's concerned. I've had two weeks off (on holiday)&nbsp;out of 52&nbsp;(one of those was Christmas, when the office was closed).  :(

Nicky Campbell said, 'We're not talking about homosexuality here', to which she replied, 'yeah but they're all the same, their type. I wouldn't trust them not to harm our kids...'.

      &nbsp; Hello. Today I've listened to Big Star (Catriona big thumbs' fave band), The Beta Band (new album) and I'm about to start on The Esteemed Orange Juice.  I've also been pondering my disintegrating memory (either that or general constant tiredness). I've forgotten how to play the violin and I couldn't even remember that Nairobi was the capital of Kenya during a game of Trivial Pursuits the other day (a similar thing happened during 80s Trivial Pursuits a few months ago with Pato - I couldn't remember that Beirut was where Terry Waite was taken hostage). What can I do to ameliorate the state of my brain? Herbal remedies? Acupuncture? Ritual beatings?

      &nbsp; Me and Pato went to see Pete Doherty playing at the launch of The Libertines exhibition on Friday night. I e-mailed some bloke from the gallery going, "Hi, it's Laura at EMI - any chance of getting on the list?" - and lo and behold, we were on the list (power). We saw Marc Bolan and Gloria Jones' son, a very bald Luke Haines, Steve Lamacq (pah!) and various indie luminaries...but no free drink, so we left. It's probably the last time anyone'll see Pete Doherty alive. Pato kept saying, "his skin's very good for a skag addict", which it was.

Or maybe there's been An Attack.  Which reminds me, we went to see Farenheit 9/11 the other night. Which in turn reminded&nbsp; me that I spent the entirety of the middle of the month of September 2001 watching CNN through my fingers (uni hadn't reconvened) - I was constantly startled by the references to The War On An Abstract Noun, above all else.   On a revolutionary tip, I also need to finish the Heat crossword so that I'm in with a chance of winning a year of free Sky Digital and fleecing The Murdoch (well, I say fleece, what I mean is 'do my bit to run his empire into the ground').

      I wasn't going to post about the weekend for fear of going over the top on a Partridge tip, but suffice to say the Coogan gives the place a rough ride...  ...although the entire city seemed completely captivated on Saturday night when we stumbled out of the restaurant to go and see Mayor's Day fireworks into a Jazz 'n' Jewellery styles affair, replete with "Shhhhhh!! It's magic!" shenanigans and electronica, the like of which I've not seen/heard since 1986.  Favourite sight-seeing observation of the weekend:  "Hey, we're on that roundabout that Alan Partridge drives on when he's bored and doesn't have anything to do. "I'll be honest with you, Lynn, I'm bored. That's why I'm tal-king...talk-ing..."..."

      I've got to stop moaning about shite 'indie' out loud - I just got laughed at for letting rip on a Chris Moyles tip ("HE IS SO FUCKING IGNORANT!! HE'S LOVING SNOW PATROL!!! SHOWS HOW MUCH MUSIC HE LISTENS TO!!"). I'm a bit red-faced, truth be told.  We're going to Norwich this weekend to meet up with Stuart's uni friends, two of whom are at various stages of pregnancy (one with twins). Anyone got any suggestions for 'baby talk'? Unlike my mum, I'm not a fan of babies (and I'm still traumatised by the 'I'm six months pregnant' dream I had on Monday night).

      By the way, I've said it before and I'll say it again, I bloody hate Snow Patrol. Well done, Radio 1/XFM and all their listeners for discovering this indie dirge after 5 BLOODY YEARS and DISTURBING OUR EARS with the god-forsaken shite. They'd have died a quick and painless death had such people just let it lie - we don't need any more Coldplays, one's enough for chrissakes!!

      I discovered this morning that Vincent Cassel was in Guest House Paradiso. I'm still recovering.  In other news, Pato bought me The Harder They Come soundtrack yesterday. I'm going to have to watch the film at some point, if anyone fancies joining me...

      Once again, it's Thursday and it's Nambucca night. You know the rest. Come and listen to some records that you might not normally hear, and drink cheap beer.  No posts due to abject lack of things to talk about. I enjoyed Supernanny last night (or whatever it's called - the title brought back memories of 80s excellence Supergran with her tam 'o' shanter and crazy antics, usually involving a motorbike and chloroform...or was that Kick Start?).

      I'm setting up some royalties for a Korean release this morning. The details on the approval request are as follows:  This will be used to guide the prisoners of Korean Jails aright (sic) for education. (Premium deal with Ministry of Justice). This 14CDs-boxed set will be played in jail daily.  ...

      I'm listening to the McFly album - and it's ace. It's got The Who, The Beatles, The Animals, The Monkees, hammond organs aplenty and really good pop songs. It's obviously not their album (apart perhaps from the lyrics) but I'm now fixated on them. I'd be quite pleased, though, if they put a word in for the sixties in Smash Hits, at some point. (Fat chance - they're Blink 182 fans).

      Thanks largely to Stuart's application and dedication, I now have a fully-functioning chest of drawers from Ikea and no longer have to store my clothes in silver plastic boxes. The huge glass cabinet by my bed (always threatening to fall on me in my sleep) is no more. And the best bit about our enforced trip to Croydon for Beanos/Ikea was being overtaken my Snoop Dogg in a Ford Capri on Peckham High Street. Or maybe it was being told by a ragged, squash-faced woman in a greasy spoon in Croydon market, "EEEAAAAHHHHH you sound EXACTLY like my sista [turns to scraggy bloke] DUN SHE?? DUN SHE!!!". Luckily for me her sister wasn't there, don't think my fragile ego could cope with being measured up by Croydon's finest trampess.

      I've decided over the past few weeks that central to the ongoing Dionysiac thrust of my life (ha!) is the acquisition of an A-level in Latin.  I was all set to do it for A-level (I was such a spod at school) until I decided to go to a comprehensive sixth form with no provision for Latin (unless you wanted to pay some old bloke to come in and teach you). I'm advertising my renewed interest in it cos I was wondering if there were any fellow thwarted potential classicists out there who wanted to join me for an evening class...?

      Chart Acts ('singles artists'?) who can outclass the current crop of soi-disant 'alternative' 'singer-songwriters/bands':  1. McFly (of course) 2. Rachel Stevens 3. Lemar (sounds like he went on every soul weekender going in the 80s, when he plainly didn't) 4. Busted (at the bottom end of the scale, but still better than Snow Patrol). 5. Jamelia  Oooh, thanks to the Snow Patrol freebie from work (the first album, I think) - I might be able to make quite a lot of money in Beano's on Saturday. I'll have to check on ebay...

      I just heard Everybody's Changing by Keane on Radio 1. Never in my life (apart from the Scissor Sisters) have I heard such a piece of dull, derivative shit. I guessed the melody line and key changes before they happened, and almost had time to write them down before the ugly bloke on the piano sang/played them. McFly are ten times better than any of these supposedly 'hip' bands (even if I decided yesterday that there's no way on earth that they write their own songs).

      Having moaned over the years about the Northerners Drinking Society etc and its exclusivity, I now discover that Hereford is officially In The North (according to the authors of the recent report on the North/South divide). I feel uprooted.

      It's time I confessed all. I'm obsessed with McFly. Their name, their songs, the fact that they can half-play... I must have watched too much Monkees when I was little (I used to launch myself at the television when the theme tune started). 'Obviously' is an absolutely cracking tune (I can hear Pato's voice now: They Nicked It Off Jellyfish!!). Does anyone care to back me up (apart from Cat at work who's just bought their album online)?

      On a 'Why's Geography more important than music?' tip, I'm going to write a list of subjects we did at school in order of disproportionality of time spent on them (worst first):  1. Maths (this is based on my ignorance of the subject and my relative need for differential equations these days). I spent my entire childhood in maths lessons, or so I remember. 2. Geography. I'm also rubbish at this subject. It should be combined with Politics and Sociology at school to make it interesting, and they should do away with all that Weathering crap (physical geography should appear during Geology lessons, which should be non-compulsory). Although we should be forced to memorise all the capitals of the world (so that I might one day win Trivial Pursuit). 3. Electronics (as part of CDT, which I'll come onto later). Why couldn't we learn plug-wiring instead of burning our fingers on soldering irons?  The next three subjects are ridiculously useful and kids should be force fed them at every opportunity:  1. CDT. This is ultimately necessary so that TV-makeover disaster shows become redundant. Having studied CDT, I realised that I was good at making Ladybird Clocks but that Ladybird Clocks were my limit, and fitting a bathroom would be foolhardy. And can I just add that people who were excellent at CDT and not scared of the pillar drills were the objects of my envy. 2. Music/Art. Lumped together because they should be part of everything. For instance, if you do a particularly good English essay, you should be forced to illustrate its main tenets with 3D playdoh figurines. Equally, if you're trying to commit a course of events to memory for History, you should be able to sing them in the style of a Dufay motet. 3. Languages. Now I know most people aren't very talented at languages, but how jealous do you feel when you hear two of your compatriots switch between French and English or Welsh and Danish? I think the answer is 'very'. I'm in favour of Latin and French for everyone. If you want to do Spanish or Italian, you can teach yourselves once you're reasonably proficient in the former two.

      Of *course* The Big Pit Museum. When I was at school, trips consisted of Big Pit, Cardiff Castle, The Black Country Museum, The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge and Newent Peregrine Falcon Trust. Also worth a mention were the Brecon Beacons, the Malverns and all the bleeding farms (I don't remember once going to a concert - why's geography more important than music??).

      To all you unannounced, clandestine stragglers, it's time to get involved... I like having visitors to my blog but I need you to leave calling cards/comments (I mean, it's as much yours as it is mine). I know I talk in a very forthright manner about contentious topics, but it's not intended to intimidate or undermine anyone else's opinion, it's just a forum for debate. There's no need to be shy!
