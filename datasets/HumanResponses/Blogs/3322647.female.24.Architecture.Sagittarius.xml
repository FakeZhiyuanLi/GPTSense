      I had my wisdom teeth "pulled" last Friday.  I would call it more yanked and broken out actually.  I've been in bed since, well until today when I actually made it to work.  We'll see how that goes.  Anywho I thought today's word of the day was rather appropriate:  lymphatic \lim-FAT-ik\ adjective  lacking physical or mental energy : sluggish  (brought to you by the folks at  urlLink Merriam-Webster )

      SUBJECT: New English language proposal in/for California RE: New 5 year proposal  The New California Governator has just announced an agreement whereby  English will be the official language of the state, rather than German which was the other possibility. As part of the negotiations, The Terminator's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5-year phase-in plan that would become known as "Austro-English" (or, if nobody will be offended, "Austrionics").  In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c". Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard "c" will be dropped in favor of the "k". This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.  There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome "ph" will be replaced with the "f". This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter.  In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible.  Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent "e" in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away.  By the 4th yer peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing "th" with "z" and "w" with "v".  During ze fifz yer, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd from vords kontaining "ou" and after ziz fifz yer, ve vil hav a reil sensibl riten styl.  Zer vil be no mor trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi tu understand ech oza.  Ze drem of a united urop vil finali kum tru.

      First-year students at Med School were receiving their first anatomy class with a real dead human body. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a white sheet.  The professor started the class by telling them, "In medicine, it is necessary to have 2 important qualities as a doctor. The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the human body."  For an example, the Professor pulled back the sheet, stuck his finger in the butt of the corpse, withdrew it and stuck his finger in his mouth. "Go ahead and do the same thing," he told his students.  The students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes, but eventually took turns sticking a finger in the butt of the dead body and sucking on it. When everyone had finished, the Professor looked at them and told them, "The second most important quality is observation. I stuck in my middle finger and sucked on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention."

      A guy gets home early from work and hears strange noises coming from the bedroom. He rushes upstairs to find his wife naked on the bed, sweating and panting. "What's up?" he says. "I'm having a heart attack," cries the woman. He rushes downstairs to grab the phone, but just as he's dialing, his four-year-old son comes up and says, "Daddy, Daddy, Uncle Ted's hiding in your closet and he's got no clothes on!" The guy slams the phone down and storms upstairs into the bedroom, past his screaming wife and rips open the closet door. Sure enough, there is his brother, totally naked, cowering on the closet floor. "You jerk," yells the husband, "my wife's having a heart attack and you're running around with no clothes on scaring the kids!"

      Fred and his wife Edna went to the state fair every year. Every year Fred would say, "Edna, I'd like to ride in that there airplane." And every year Edna would say, "I know Fred, but that airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."  One year Fred and Edna went to the fair and Fred said, "Edna, I'm 71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance." Edna replied, "Fred that there airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."  The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten dollars."  Fred and Edna agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks over again, but still not a word.  They land and the pilot turns to Fred, "By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't."  Fred replied, "Well, I was gonna say something when Edna fell out, but ten dollars is ten dollars."

       From the readers at handlebars.org   March 28, 2004 11:24 PM  It's bad enough to be assaulted at the airport as you're about to board a flight. It's even worse when the man who assaults you is exercise guru and cult-classic extraordinaire Richard Simmons.  An unidentified man made an "off-the-cuff comment," according to Phoenix police, towards Simmons last week at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport. Simmons apparently did not appreciate the man telling other passengers, "Hey everybody, it's Richard Simmons. Let's drop our bags and rock to the 50's!" Rather than shrug it off or walk away, Simmons walked up to the man and slapped him. Oh, to have been a fly on that wall.  Rather than be a sport and take the slap in stride, seeing as how he was not injured, the man is insisting on pressing charges towards Simmons, who was cited for misdemeanor assault before being allowed to board the plane. Here's to the judge sentencing both of them to a nice warm glass of shut the hell up.

      In pharmacology, all drugs have two names, a trade name and a generic name. For example, the trade name of Tylenol also has the generic name of acetominophen. Aleve is called naproxen. Amoxil is also called amoxicillin and Advil is also called ibuprofen. The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra. After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of mycoxafloppin. Also considered were mycoxafailin, mydixadrupin, mydixadud, dixafix and, of course, ibepokin.

      Two Italian men are on a bus. They engage in an animated conversation. The lady behind them ignores them at first, but her attention is galvanized when she hears one of the men say, "Emma come first. Den I come. Den two asses come together. I come once more. Two asses, they come together again. I come again and pee twice. Then I come one last time." "You foul-mouthed sex obsessed swine," interjects the woman, indignantly. "In this country, we don't speak in pubic places about our sex lives." "Hey, settle down, lady," said the man. "Who's talking abouta sexa? I'ma just telling my frienda how to spella Mississippi."

      On a flight to Chicago, a gentleman had made several attempts to get into the men's restroom, but it had always been occupied. The flight attendant noticed his predicament. "Sir, she said, "You may use the ladies room if you promise not to touch any of the buttons on the wall." He did what he needed to, and as he sat there he noticed the buttons he had promised not to touch. Each button was identified by letters: WW, WA, PP, and a red one labeled ATR. Who would know if he touched them? He couldn't resist. He pushed WW. Warm water was sprayed gently upon his bottom. What a nice feeling, he thought. Men's restrooms don't have nice things like this. Anticipating greater pleasure, he pushed the WA button. Warm air replaced the warm water, gently drying his underside. When this stopped, he pushed the PP button. A large powder puff caressed his bottom adding a fragilescent of spring flowers to this unbelievable pleasure. The ladies restroom was more than a restroom, it is tender loving pleasure. When the powder puff completed its pleasure, he couldn't wait to push the ATR button he knew would be supreme ecstasy. Next thing he knew he was in a hospital as soon as he opened his eyes. A nurse was staring down at him with a smirk on her face. "What happened?" he exclaimed. "You pushed one too many buttons," replied the nurse. "The last button marked ATR was an Automatic Tampon Remover. Your penis is under your pillow."

      I thought this was hilarious...it's from some  urlLink random guy's blog .  Too funny.    I'm not sure how I found this, but I'm a little embarrassed that I never knew this before now. After all of the science and biology I studied I just found out that there were tiny creatures living literally on our faces. I'm slightly horrified. I'd go wash again if it helped, which, apparantly, it doesn't. (Unless I washed with turpentine or something equally toxic.) There's nothing worse to someone with mildly OCD tendencies than an uncontrollable situation. I know that it's ridiculous, but I can't touch my forehead without getting a little squeamish now. Give me a few days and I'll get used to the idea.  Because let's face it: I still use Internet Explorer. And I don't think there's anything with more bugs in it than that.

      1. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.  2. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.  3. The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.  4. A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.  5. Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.  6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.  7. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.  8. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.  9. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.  10. HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.  11. Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.  12 A president lying about an extramarital affair is a impeachable offense.  A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.  13. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.  14. The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.  15. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery.  16. You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.  17. What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.
