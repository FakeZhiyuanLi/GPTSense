       nope.....i dint get engaged! tho i like the idea of it! but the aftermath (marriage) of it is somethin like a last resort, ofcourse, before suicide!  anyways.... my elder cousin sis got  engaged last thursdae'! she was not happy....but i was not as unhappy for her as she was for herself.  she has an inferiority complex which has only grown more over a period of time. my aunt and uncle had been lookin for a groom for her since 2 years or more i guez....she faced a lot of rejections coz she was "fat"! till date, i havent understood the concept of paradin' urself in front of a "suitable" groom waitin for him to nod his dickhead as a sign of approval! but why is it that the girl never gets to do the same thin'? whateva, thats not whut i intended to convey...  after 2 years of rejections and disqualified candidates her parents finally came across a 'suitable' groom for her... his approval was like a wish granted straight from the heavens. whut my sister thought was irrelevant, or maybe she gave in due to unexplainable pressures from everybody including the relatives. it surprises me because she is never the one to give in so..easily! nobody expected her to reject the proposal, infact it was taken for granted that she wud accept the offer, maybe that explains why they dint discuss the offer in detail with her!  now,  she frets and fumes at his views and opinons about their post-mariage life. their ideas on life and lifestyle coincide rarely. the worst part is that she cant even express her frustration in front of her parents or her "close" relatives.  but, i am sure time only will tell if all this was a futile exercise... but my point is whut is the use a marriage when there is a lack of consent?!! lack of consent arises in cases of differences in culture, interests, ambitions and more so, and i believe thay can all be overcome. but for that, you need to build a state of mind which readies itself to adapt not to shun! knowing my sister, it is difficult and an ego-beating exercise for her... and when egos are hurt???!!   think about it.....

        i dun think i have mentioned that i wurk in a call centre, but yes i work for AOL. pretty good company, frenly ppl, nice work and ambience too... anyways today i moved into a new team from a wonderful, alive and kickin team. not that this team is bad or anythin...itz just that therz an obvious lack of energy. i mean in the previous team there was so much of positiv air, sense of unity and responsibility... interest in the performance and all this happend over a period of time. so, basically ther was a history to it. it did take time... but, for instance if u look at the reason as to why i walked out from that team..i myself dunno why? whut did i bargain for in the end? even in othe instances when we just walk out of relationships, work, home...without a reason, we walk out of a history! we walk out ta chalk out a new chapter and thatz excitin for me! to break from conventionalism of the daily life is like a breath of fresh air... but then again, itz got more to do wit da state of mind.
