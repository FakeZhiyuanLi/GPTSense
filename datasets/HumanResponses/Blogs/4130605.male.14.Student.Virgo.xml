      I was watching TV the other day and I saw a commercial for Cap'n Crunch Cereal. It was at this point when I came to the conclusion that the Cap'n and Santa Clause are very alike, and possibly the same person. I mean they both love kids and give kids things. Granted one is awesome presents and the other is nasty sugary cereal. Then there is the fact they kind of look alike. They're both older with grey hair and always wear a uniform. So I think it is very likely that they are the same person. So who is this person you ask? It is obvious it is the Quaker Oatmeal guy. So either I have uncovered a huge conspiracy or I'm just hungry.

      I was recently watching t.v. and I heard somebody say "Money is a sport." This kind of made me think. If money is a sport then your biggest athlete is Bill Gates. To be honest if somebody like Bill Gates is the biggest athlete in a sport, it's a pretty pathetic sport. The closest thing to training for money would be working, but if that's the practice what's the game? And how do you explain finding 20 dollars in your wallet after last winter? See so until you can give me answers I fail to see money as a sport (just a hobby). Though I did here this from a person on a reality show, so I think I took it too far.

      I have grown quite tired of taking (in vain) measures to prevent getting SPAM on my Yahoo account. Recently I have discovered a way to stop repeat spammers. Spam them. It's kind of like those pesky telemarketers. I recieved a spam email from somebody trying to sell me valium. So I sent a reply email to him saying: Dear Spam-face, I would like to thank you for offering the great deal on valium. Factory price sounds great, however, I have to decline. I would much rather have diazepam rectal gel, as it gives me a tingling feeling in my anal area. Though I may take you up on your offer next time I am on the phone with tech support.                                                                     With Love,                                                                            Christopher Wells   I then took the email address and went to as many sites as I could think of and signed him up for every newsletter I could find.

          We all know we're supposed to stay in school so we don't wind up working at (well, I can't use their actual name so I will cleverly change it) McBurger Place, right? Wrong! You should stay in school so you don't wind up like the people who eat there! As I work at a restaurant, I can see what kind of people come in. Most of them good average people (wouldn't want to insult my customers, would I?). However, there are those occasional bumbling idiots who wander in there. For example, we had somebody who tried to order something we didn't have on our menu. The cashier explained to him that he would have to order something else. This would have been alright with your average customer, but this man was a true enlightment to me. I didn't realize how dumb the general population could be. The man after repeatedly being told we don't offer his choice of meal, began to raise his voice asking for the manager. My manager approached the man and asked him what the problem was. After being told that we could not prepare him his desired cuisine, the gentleman began to yell "This is bull!" My manager apologized to the man and asked if he wanted something else. The man said "No." and went and sat down at a table. Ten minutes later he approached the register again and ordered something off the menu. That would have been it for your extremely retarded monkey, but he was dumber than this. After eating his whole meal he approached the counter one more time and demanded his money back, because the meal was not appetizing. It took another ten minutes before we could persuade him to leave. Society is doomed. I was in awe of the level stupidity he demonstrated. And that is why you stay in school even if you are retarded.

      So I was sitting at church this Sunday, and it happened to be communion Sunday (I'm always happy when it is communion Sunday because the sermons are shorter!). I got up to the bread took the grape juice (wine), and sat down. That's when I realized Jesus chose the most boring things for his body and blood. I mean bread and wine? I've got to give him credit for the fact that he chose an alcoholic beverage, but wine? If I were Jesus (God save us!), I would have chosen something people enjoy eating. Like popcorn. Popcorn and Rootbeer. That's the stuff. This is my body w/ extra butter for you. And take this non-caffeinated rootbeer for my blood. Jesus could have done better (praying lightning doesn't strike me). I think this whole "not trying" thing runs in his family, though. I mean God built the world in 6 days and took a breather on the 7th. I mean thats a whole week! That's a long time for anything! The U.S. Postal service is faster than that. Well, now that I am going to hell for Blasphemy, have a great day. Note: this is probably the most religious I will get.
