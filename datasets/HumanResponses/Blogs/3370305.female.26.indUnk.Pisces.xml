						     Did you ever notice that some people just emit a slimey vibe? After talking with some people, or in rarer cases, simply seeing some people, there's a greasy film laying heavy in your mind.      I have an Uncle like that, whom I had the unwanted, unasked for displeasure of talking to this weekend. Break out the stereotype meters...he happens to be a used car salesman. Shocked you, didn't it? Yeah, he's the one all of the jokes were written about.       He once tried to sell his own mother a mini van that had been welded together down the middle, and had coathangers holding vital components together underneath. It didn't seem to matter that she could be killed, or that she was never in a vehicle with less than 6 grandchildren (his included) and was more often than not on the busy highway. Nope, none of that mattered, what mattered was the easy sell he had before him.     I don't know why I bring that up exactly, other than the fact that the slick oily feeling is still with me after talking to him. It's just that I had the television on the news channel and politicians were talking nonchalantly about terrible problems  from their two dimensional world, and I had a quick redip in the greasy pool. I turned it and found myself looking at a commercial for FOX's 'show' The Swan and was practically drowning in the feeling, only this time it came with a smell...like rotten cabbage atop a garbage filled dumpster on a hot humid day.

						           I noticed while searching other blogs, that the one nasty little thing that plagues the masses, is lack of comments. Some brave bloggers throw convention to the wind and flat out beg for it, some coyly hint they'd like some, and some silently fume behind their computer screens vowing revenge and swearing that people don't know a good thing when they see it.  It's kind of like sex, I suppose. The computer has made us all wee little comment whores.        I'm wondering, how many bloggers go into their shrinks and bring up their lack of comments or hits? Can't you picture it, them laying on the sofa (do shrinks really use those, btw?) telling the doc how no one loved them as children, no one respects them at work, and there's no one to go home to at night; so they got an online journal to make a connection with some soul out there, even if it is on a computer, and they don't appear to want them there either. When that first popped into my head, I thought it was a funny joke, ha ha, but now that I've really thought about it, I bet there are people who do that and it's not so funny anymore.     Do you think lack of response is the reason for the countless 'ghost sites' out there? You know the kind I'm talking about? The first entry was 5 months ago, and filled with exuberance and hope for a smashing success, than sloooooooooowllyyy the happiness drains out of the ever shorter postings, until one day, three weeks after the first posting, there's nothing left. Is that the 21st century's new grafitti? Just a sad abandoned site, floating through cyberspace like a big, 'I was here' carved into a tree at the local make-out place.   *imported from my other journal*

						     Why do people ask your opinion on things, than argue with you when you state them? If you don't want to take the risk that someone may not agree with you, why ask them?      Example. A friend asks me about what's happening in Iraq right now and though she knows I'm not a huge fan of Bush, or the war, she still acts like it's a huge shock when I tell her exactly how I feel about it. She than proceeds to argue with me about my opinion, as if she might bring light into my dull cobweb infested mind, showing me where I've ran astray and wooing me back over to the side of right.     Can I just say, I take pride in the fact that I don't take my opinions and cram them down the throats of others. I don't try and brow beat those who don't think like me, and I have enough f**king sense not to go asking a rabid, die-hard Republican their ideas on an issue I know they don't agree with, expecting them to change for me.   make that, some people deserve three slaps, and a kick in the knee cap.

						    I don't know what in the hell I'm doing wrong, but each time I try and insert a link section and republish, nothing! The links do show up if you hit 'commnet' but not on the main page. :( I told ya I was a feeb.     Screw it.

						    I've already written a very longwinded, non-sensical post once today on my other journal site, so I'm not sure what I intend to write here. I actually really like the other site, but the free version only allows for 25 links, and I decided to see what everyone else offers.  I hope I get this figured out relatively quickly, fat chance, I'm a bit slow when it comes to anything technical. Took me long enough to master holding a crayon. They don't seem to sell a computer equivilant of the big fat crayon, so it's sink or swim for me.

						   &nbsp;  &nbsp; The Promise   She sits, limbs stretched lazily before her, looking up through the wind tossed branches overhead. The light of the noon sun shifts everchanging patterns of light and dark shadow across the bridge of her freckled nose, and she closes her eyes enjoying the play of red and black on her eyelids. The smell of spring grass blossoms around her, comingled with rich soil and the wet earthy scent of the stream below.  She looks down toward the water and watches two tow headed boys attempting to fish in the shallow currents, and laughs enternally at distant memories of sunny spring days beside slow moving streams. The breeze picks up and blows fluffy white dandelion seeds in her hair, and before her eyes. Distant floral perfumes dance along the breeze and fill the day with their splendor. A dog barks from afar, and birds chatter from the trees. A mother passes on the bike trail, pushing a stroller with a chubby red faced toddler inside. One pink socked foot kicks steadily back and forth and has lost it's small red shoe. A sticky sucker is clutched tightly in the childs hand and a fat stray curl is plastered to the side of her small red face by sweat. The baby smiles and waves, and is gone.  She looks longingly after the little family of two, and than expectantly at the horizon to the North. Soon he will make his way over the sloping hill and&nbsp;return to her. Soon, his smiling eyes and lazy smile will be all she sees as he finally arrives.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Ramblin' Hoosier~

						   &nbsp; &nbsp; The lightning found the center of the old Oak in the yard, splitting it nearly in two. Twisted, charred pieces of timber fan out around it like a hula skirt, and smoke still rises from within. There is a deep black crater just visible from the house, lying where the roots once layed, and we run out to take a closer look.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surface of the tree is strangely both cool and hot to the touch. The rain has fallen unrelentingly since dawn and everything in sight is heavy with the moisture. The limbs sag forlornly, carrying fresh green leaves dripping fat drops of&nbsp;water on our heads. There's a noise coming from the depths of the blackened 0ak and we stop, suddenly aware it could fall. We listen intently, soft mews are coming from the woody remains, barely audible. It sounds like the cry of a small animal, but somehow human. Slowly we go forward and look into the splayed timber.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our breath catches and we gasp in wonder at the beautiful silver flower growing from the dark sooty mud in the oaks burnt embrace. It is untouched and undirtied. A perfect flower, unlike any we've ever seen. We shift a piece of wood and a ray of bright, after shower sunlight gleams down on the silver bud. It burst into bloom, petals peeling slowly open, and in the center, sitting perched in a bed of golden pollen, is a tiny silver girl. She stands and unfurls silver wings that flutter in the breeze. I bend down and peer, astounded, at the tiny figure. She stretches and yawns and I know what the mewing sound must have been. She turns and sees me. Her diminutive features transform into a mask of shock, than slowly impatience. She puts her small hands to her hips and looks into my eyes. "What? You've never seen the birth of a lightning bug before?"   She flaps her wings and hops from the flower, disappearing into a cloud of shining dust and tinkling laughter.   &nbsp;Ramblin' Hoosier~

						    The Clock    The ticking clock assualts his ears as he sits waiting, always waiting. The path of his constantly roaming toe is clearly visible in the faded green carpet, physical witness to his seemingly endless vigilance outside the thick oak door. A steady muted hum carries through the hall from some appliance downstairs, and he tries to capture it in his ears to drown out the ticking clock. It doesn't work.   He's sat in this same chair, in this same hall, every afternoon and evening for the past three months, always waiting for the moment to arrive, always taunted by the passing time lauded over him by the ticks and chimes of the old Grandfather to his left. He jerks his head from his hands, and peers at the closed door again. His hands clench in a sweaty grasp and he raises weakly from the chair. He pauses, suspended between sitting and standing, and sits heavily back down, head weakly crumpling back to his waiting hands.   The clock ticks steadily on and the day is falling into night, and the moment has again eluded them. He peers to his right through the darkened window at the end of the hall, and his conscience struggles against his cowardice. It screams for him to rise and enter the room before it's to late,before she's gone. He wants nothing more than to see her, to hold her frail body to his breast and ease the pain, and comfort the heart that so comforted his own, but his weakness wins, and he sits, and waits, and the clock continues to tick away the moments of a life that meant so much. A life that meant so much, that he cannot bear to see it slip away, and he hates himself for it, and he hates the fates for making him such a coward through their theft of life.  And he sits and waits, the clock ticking away the day.

						   Geez, where in the heck could anyone draw the conclusion that the books were cooked for political gain? :-0 Hmm, the report says terrorism is on the decline when in fact it's increased. Hmm, the main strength of the Bush Administration is it's "ability and strength" in the war against terror. Nope, I don't see a thing suspicious about it at all. urlLink iWon News

						     I found another great blog read today surfing urlLink I respectfully dissent , suggest you give it a read if you get the chance.    I'm still depressed about Smarty Jones losing on Saturday! I really thought he would do it, and the saddest thing is, he was more than capable. Oh well, he is still an amazing creature and I loved the class and loyalty of the people around him, that's the true measure of a champion.

						   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ballet of Beauty  Radiant in pink. &nbsp;Satin curls, that gleam In streams of gold Are tossed, like so many wishes Over shoulders of bisque The creamy white of milk. Sapphire illuminations Light your cast aside glance As you preen and pirouette Prance on point A dreamlike dance. Laughter like lilting lullaby's Shiver in silver streams Flowing through dreams of joy From which you spring Heavenly little dancer Who laces love with light And shines bright as life Dance eternal,Little dream.  &nbsp;Ramblin' Hoosier~

						   &nbsp;&nbsp; A pigeon coos and beats it's wings against the windowpane. It's talons grab for purchase, scratching the sill and the noise almost hides the soft sounds of it's young calling from a foot away. She pours a cup of coffee and tries half-heartedly to shoo the mother bird away.  &nbsp;"They cause disease, you know." She says, and he isn't sure to whom she's speaking, him or herself.   &nbsp;When she waves her hand toward the window the&nbsp;belt of her robe comes untied and opens on her old&nbsp;faded plaid pajamas. The bottom button of the shirt is missing and he catches occasional flashes of her belly button when she moves.   &nbsp;Suddenly, he wants nothing more from life than to kiss it. To feel the silky skin on his lips, to have her heartbeat dance beneath his&nbsp;roving fingertips.&nbsp;   &nbsp;A sharp pain shoots through his mind, and trickles painful fire through his chest. He knows the feeling well, has felt it more and more frequently these last few weeks, especially when looking at her as he is now.   &nbsp;She's running a tired hand through her sleep mussed hair, auburn sparks catching the morning sunrays and his eyes burn to look upon it. One hand casually wipes the sleep from her eyes, and she turns to him; smiling.   &nbsp;Oh god, she looks so much like the first time they woke together, even after all these years and he feels the familiar pull of her in his heart. An unwelcome, unwanted image fills his mind. An image of another mans lips pressed to the slight swell of her abdomen, someone else's fingers tracing the rhythm of her heart. For the briefest moment the guilt that burns in his gut is overshadowed by the rage the image provokes and he can't believe how he has let things crumble to this lonely state. How could he ever have thought to touch another, especially one so below the one before him; the one he loves.   &nbsp;She laughs and he looks up into her eyes. "If only I had a penny for your thoughts just now," she says, "you had the strangest look in your eyes, like tortured bliss."&nbsp;   &nbsp;He smiles weakly and quickly kisses her goodbye, head spinning in guilt and shame as he heads to work.   &nbsp;She watches from the window, tired and trying hard to&nbsp;reconcile her love for him with the newly growing hate and pain.   &nbsp;Ramblin' Hoosier~&nbsp;

						   A lowly indigent- needing nothing, yet filled with want only for a breath of your soul. I need not possess it; indeed I do not want to own the whole I see no need to become as one, for the one I love  would no longer be and without that breath I could not breathe to fulfill that single want there could be none richer then I would be.

						     She looks lovely sitting by the pane glass window, afternoon sunlight falling on her shoulder and lighting the side of her thin face. On the table before her is a faded and ragged paperback, and a large cup of some fifteen-syllable-$6.00 coffee only to be found in quaint out of the way shops like this or on any corner at the local Starbucks. Dreamily, she looks up from her book and stares out the window, a distant look in her eye.   Outside traffic flows  unnoticed by her hazy blue gaze, and from the bar the man watches enchanted. For hours he thinks of ways to approach, worries over lame lines and public rejection. Twice now, he has summoned the waitor over ready to order her another coffee sent with his regards, but at the last moment it sounds tacky to him and he orders another black coffee for himself instead.   She lowers her eyes to her book again, a small secret smile just visible on her lips faint as a whispered secret. He is hypnotised by that smile and lost to fantasies of it's origins, inserting himself in each. He rises and sits at a table a little closer, hoping to draw her eye. She remains lost in her book, and his mind cajoles him for not going over to her.     He stands. For a moment that seems to draw on forever his feet refuse to move as suddnly the thought that this could very well be the one, his soul mate, fills his mind and all he can think of is ruining it before it starts and the terrible lonliness his life will be if he does. With unsteady steps, his feet finally lurch forward, bring him closer to the object of his new found fervent passion and dreams. She stirs slightly as he nears, and lifts her eyes to his for a moment. That secret smile flashes again, a ghostly trace and then is gone. His heart pounds joyously in his chest and he glides on oblivious to anything that can go wrong, that look, that single glance would be enough to give courage to the most frightened heart! He turns to ask her name and is startled to see her through the window of the store. In his excitment he's walked right passed her and into the summer sun.   With a dejected spirit he turns and walks toward home mourning the one that could have been.   Ramblin' Hoosier~

						    Softly, the pale moon glows  stars faint, then quickly blaze.  Dazzling meteor shows-  vanish in a milky haze  Passionate dreams ignite,  fill my slumbering gaze,  sights far lovelier then night-  lovely as newborn golden days.

						    I abandoned to you my soul,  My life, my pride, my dreams  Surrendered to you the whole,  Asked of you not a thing.   My idol of tarnished gold,  Your power is growing thin,  There on your crumbling throne,  My love for you is my sin.   Ramblin' Hoosier~
