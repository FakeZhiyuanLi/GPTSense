      Hey whats up? NMH I am soo tired for some odd reason, Hmm maybe it is b/c I had to get up at 6:30 to get ready to for summer school, Blah! I mean it isn't that bad, all you do is sit there and learn, so there is no real physical activity goin on there but still it's school ya know? Well anyways I get up and go and when I get home my brother had been doin nothin all mornin, he hadn't even done the dishwasher...and I mean God! They all expect me to clean up after them all the time...I hate this crap..So instead of doin it I went upstairs and went to sleep and now I am gettin ready to leave for work soo Fun Fun! I am OuT!

      Hey whats up? NMH...I was just thinking and well do people really think I am stupid or somin? I mean come on here...ya sure I act ditze sometimes but I am not stupid..I know more than what some people think and I know I deny it most of the time and I know that my intelligence goes out the window when I am with certain people but I know...this all started a long time ago when I used to want to hang out with my older cousin b/c he was "kool" and well just being me wasn't enough so I decided to act stupid and ditze and sure enough I was accepted, but not as me...They (my cousin and his friends) wanted me to hang out with them so that they could pick on me and make fun of me b/c well it made them feel well 1. More powerfull and 2.More intelligent...so I have been living as of course me, in my mind, but on the outside someone I am really not. It's kinda funny when I think about it b/c i would change everything I am just to be accepted because I do not feel as if people would accept me for me...well you know what, that stage in my life is now officially over. I am done with that and I am tired of being treated like I do not know anything and I am tired of people taking advantage of me just b/c they know they can..I deal with a lot of crap from a lot of people and I deal with it b/c I know that is the only way to settle things easily and it is the lazy way out b/c I don't want to have to work to make someone else compromise with me and actually admit that in some ways they were wrong too, so I just leave it alone and let it go and once again get stuck in something that I shouldn't be stuck in...Well I am done dammit! I am just done! I am not stupid and I am tired of having people step all over me b/c they can...soo Fuck all of you who think I am a welcome mat cuz I am not, Dammit I am a human being and if you wanna walk on me then do you and I both a favor and get out of my life! Ok Sorry had to rant about that, it was botherin but otherwise I am gonna go soo I am OuT! ~A*J

I am really sorry that they decide that they need to jump down each others throats for no reason...it's just one of those things I guess, u need drama every once in awhile but hmm.. Ok and I just want to let you two know that you were my entertainment for the night and at the same time my biggest worry so Go and kiss and make up you bastards or I am gonna kick some f'in ass got it?!

LoL I don't think he knew quite how to respond to that one..soo but ne-waze after we told him we all went and hung out and then Cody and Greg went for a talk and me and the sexy beaner and the gorgeous Matt went over to his house and Me, Cody and Greg talked and everything was fine we all agreed not to act wierd around each other and to all just be one big happy fuckin Family..LOL and soo we are..there is more that I could post but I am not goin to cuz I am sure that the guys will post about it so I will let them tell you..but ne-waze ya...whata night to remember...God I am soo confused..I dunno what just hit me and I am still in shock about what happened tonight..is this right? Is this the way it should be? Cause I have no clue what so ever...Hmm every thing happens for a reason and I believe that..Soo I am gonna go now and well, think about all of this and try to get through to myself what I am gonna do and what I really want ok?

       The Best Thing     Never want to fly Never want to leave Never want to say what you mean to me Never want to run Frightened to believe You're the best thing about me   Sometimes I feel like this is only chemistry Stuck in a maze searching for a way to Shut down turn around feel the ground beneath me You're so close where do you end and where do I begin? Always pushing and pulling   Sometimes sanity takes vacation time on me I'm in a daze stumbling bewildered North of gravity head up in the stratosphere You and I roller coaster riding love   You're the center of adrenaline And I'm beginning to understand   Never want to fly Never want to leave Never want to say what you mean to me Never want to run Frightened to believe You're the best thing about me   Walk on broken glass make my way through fire These are the things I would do for love Farewell peace of mind kiss goodbye to reason Up is down the impossible occurs each day This intoxication thrills me I only pray it doesn't kill me   Never want to fly Never want to leave Never want to say what you mean to me Never want to run Frightened to believe You're the best thing about me   You're the center of adrenaline And I'm beginning to understand You could be the best thing about me   Never want to fly Never want to leave Never want to say what you mean to me Never want to run Frightened to believe You're the best thing about me  ~Savage Garden

      Hey whats up? NMH...I just got back from a night out with Cody...I guess I didn't really know how strong my feelings were for him until I kissed him and then it hit me..Hmm ok first I went out to his house to pick him up and then we hung out for a minute and he tried to explain politics to me but it was no use...I am just not into that kinda thing..Ok but then we went and picked up Matt and it was like 6:15 so we went and parked and just hung out in the car for awhile..it was kool to just talk and shoot the shit...and then it happened me and Cody's first kiss...Oh g's I dunno why or how it even happened I just leaned over and well it seemed right soo we went for it...lol..don't ask but I know it wasn't bad. So then after sitting in my car for about an hour we went over to Trilogy and hung out with the band and stuff and they didn't even get started til late soo we didn't stay the whole time...we left there at about 9:15 and we dropped Matt off at his house and then Me and Cody went to Nan's we got a pizza and we were supposed to watch a movie but instead me and Cody went out to the balcony and had some alone time together and well I got a lot off my chest and you know he sat there and listened to me and he let me know that I have his support through thick and thin and he pretty much let me know that whatever happens he is there and well I thank him soo much for that, I soo need that kind of support right now with all these emotions I am handling...Oh and by the way I am now Cody's girlfriend..I guess we kind of skipped the dating scene and went right for the relationship..lol we were dating for what 2 days max, oh g's but hey it's all good...soo but ne-waze I am tired and kinda out of it right now...it is takin me so long to type this because I keep messin up..lol...soo I am OuT!  ~Ashley

                    "Tears" My couch is drenched my bed is soaked I have already died once.. I have already choked The emotional out pour of my existence The constant pain and dying resistance My eyes burn with the release of unhappiness And my stomach turns with awful sickness My blood runs down my arm to show of all How I once stood and now I fall Unknown to me I would be captured by grief All I need now is never ending relief The knife falls to the floor, I cut to deep I lie on my bed and scream and weep God why me? Why me? I can't handle this anymore I am out of life..I am out of here..I am just to soar So many emotions hit me at the same time I turn over and look up and begin to wine I am done with this life of nothing but tears I am goin to end it now and take away my fears Tonight this world I shall part As I take the knife and run it through my heart.  ~A*J   Go to  http://aj9986.deviantart.com/

      Words of Encourgement...  5/5/2004   Hey whats up? I just wrote a few things that I would like to share with who ever reads this...here ya go:   Love what you have, it may not be exactly what you want but it’s all you got and while you have it you might as well make it the best thing in your life.  Love what you don’t have, but not to the point where that’s all you think about, but just enough to keep you going in that direction.  Think about your day, and all that it meant and/or did for you.  Don’t stop, the biggest mistake in life is thinking that there is no point in going any further than where you are at.  When you walk through the store or anywhere public take a look around and realize that aLthough you may judge others they are all here for the same purpose as you are and that you are more alike than what you make think.  Don’t save the best for last indulge it while its here for you never know when time may run out.  Don’t hide your feelings for others from others..you never know telling them could be the best thing that could ever happen to you.  Most of the time the only person holding you back is you..don’t doubt yourself you are all you have got.  At the end of the day right before you go to sleep think about your day, analyze it, cherish it, and learn from it, for it may be your last.  Love it all, just love it all for life is a beauty that very few see.  Poor people are not disgusting and are not irresponsible they just got caught up in their life and it blinded them from everything else.  Celebrities are people who were laid out for the purpose of being looked at and for the purpose of inspiration towards others who would like to look like them.  Singing is the release of emotions from the soul, but only those who can express their emotions can sing.  Live it up! Make the best of all of this! You only go through life once..don't hold back!  ~A*J

      Hey whats up? I have been a lot of things these last few days, emotionally that is. I finally broke down last night when It finally hit me..my whole world came down on me in a period of two days..I was standing next to my bed and all of the sudden I just fell to the floor and started balling my eyes out...I couldn't breathe I couldn't even think straight I just cried and cried some more..I am sorry Greg if I have been mean to you but it is my only responze to how I feel about everything that has happened, I feel like it was all just unfair...I told you I wanted you to be happy but I didn't realize in order for you to do so I would be badly hurt..And well I think we know about the Tara situation, that is if you've read Cody's diary..and that is leaving me feeling helpless also..I am just fucking up aren't I? Maybe I should just quit and go back to where I was before all of this...I will go back to my little hole where I came from and will just stay there...I can't help but feel this never ending pain right now..  ~A*J

      Hey whats up? NMH...I have been thinkin alot lately and what choice have I had but to do so and you know what? I am scared..I knew what my relationship was with Greg It was familiar and I didn't have to worry about startin all over but now I am heading towards a new relationship and well I am just plain scared...I don't know what he is like in a relationship...I don't know anything about a relationship with this guy..and well I will admit it is good for me to get away from the "same old same old" but I am not one to like changes unless I make them myself and in this case I had no choice but to change...Cody Thank You soo much for everything you have done for me since the break-up I don't think I could have done it without you and hopefully I will get to see you Monday and we can take "talking" from there ok? But hey I am gonna go now, I have got this sudden urge to cry..I have been doin a lot of that lately you know?  ~A*J

      Hey you know what? I just thought of something really funny..Scott was in my car today b/c we were waiting to pick up my bro and his cousin from Summer PE and i told him that me and Greg had broke up and all of the sudden the connection we had lost came back....thats a little strange don't you think and all of the sudden it was like he was totally interested again...I was sitting thinkin "you messed up buddy, your gay, and I don't see gay guys.." lol I love Scott soo much! He is soo my best guy friend..but no right now I am getting hit on hard by another guy and I am really enjoying that..wow..some of the lines he has used..it is like Damn! Where have you been all my life? LoL but ne-waze I work tonight from 5-730 and then hopefully I will get to do something with Cody but I am not sure yet I got grounded..ya grounded..the same time my b/f broke up with me and my best friend got pissed at me..Damn!

      Hey Whast up? NMH...I have no clue what I am doing anymore...I have too many emotions to sort through and I have to repair whats left of them. I only wish I could understand why this happens to me everytime I think I am doing the right thing. I wish I could just get away from this..I just want to get away from all of this! I am so tempted to just walk out that door right now get all of my money and just never come back..and what is sad about it is that I only know of a few people it would actually hurt. I have recently decided that my break-up happened for a reason..1st of all to knock some sense into me and 2nd of all to introduce me to someone else..now I dunno about you but when you talk on the phone to someone and you catch urself constantly smiling and blushing...I think you have got it bad..and well I do but it is only fair for me to wait a little bit and make sure he is not just a rebound..I thought it would take me awhile but it is movin on faster than what I thought but anyways it is like 8:30am and I am exhausted so I am goin back to bed now...  ~A*J

      How can love be soo cruel yet so nice to you..I am suffering from one mans mistakes and rejoicing from another mans love...I am soo twisted right now with all my emotions one minute I cry because of my heartache and the next I sigh b/c of my love for someone else..Ohh, this is a lot to handle and u know I am passed the pissed off stage of this break up and I am now moving on to where I am gonna go numb and keep everyone out b/c one man decided to break me apart..I don't know what inspires him to hurt me or mess with me and my emotions or lie to me to my face but all I know is that he messed up...and now I have to put myself back together because of his careless shit...Hmm if I could only see him right now...Oh I have this all planned out...oh ya I do...I have it all planned out..  ~A*J

      Hey whats up? NMH I am sitting down at my dining room table eating lunch...I have been thinking about it and what kind of morales exist anymore...I used to think I had good morales but up until recently I think I have been settling for less than what I deserve...I know what is wrong and I know what I should do about it but it is really possible that i am willing to sacrifice myself instead of goin thro the drama to solve it? I just don't come first in my life and I need to change that but in order to change that some people are goin to get hurt b/c I am gonna have to stand up for myself and not let people walk all over me anymore...at one point it was ok and kinda funny at times but now it is just damaging and stressful soo I am gonna have to say fuck this shit it is now time to do what is best for me and soo well&nbsp;I am now on a "all me" streak soo if ya plan on walkin on me then u had better think twice...b/c well&nbsp;I aint takin it anymore...Ok I am done with that, tomorrow is my final in govt. Whoop-de-doo!&nbsp;I am gonna fail it b/c well I am stupid when it comes to shit like that soo ya I am gonna be stressed tomorrow but ohwell it's all good..Thurs. I am goin to K-ville to see my man and help him paint or somin..I dunno but as long as&nbsp;I see him I will be ok :)...I dunno how I am gonna be able to control my self around him but I think I might be able to manage lets just hope we aren't alone for more than 10mins ;) LoL but hey I am gonna go now b/c&nbsp;I am gonna take a nap b4 work soo I'm OuT! ~A*J

Ok but no, we were walkin down this street and at this gas station we saw Brad and we like freaked out and ran up to him and like tackled him...and then we went to this restaurant where we me and brad and this other chick sat and talked and it was funny cuz I was talkin to Brad as if he were actually there and he answered my questions and I actually feel as if I did in fact talk to him..Hmm I dunno..Second one: I was at my old house and we were having likea family reunion and well Greg showed up and he wouldn't stop making nasty comments to carl and so Greg, Nan, Levi, Kyle, and I left and went to this building...don't ask cuz I don't know but when we got there it was like a hotel and we were on the 9th floor just chillin when all of the sudden we felt the building shake and heard this big boom and all of the sudden the fire alarms went off and so since we couldn't use the elevators we took the stairs and for some odd reason Greg got off at a different floor than I did and everyone kept making me go so I couldn't get off with him and I was all worried and scared and then I got to the bottom floor and ran outside and there he was waiting for me...wierd huh? Ya I thought so...but no that was my amusin night of dreams and well I g2g soo I am OuT! ~A*J

      Hey whats up? NMH....my fav question is "Why?" I have asked this question since I can remember even talkin..right now I have a "Why" question. Why can't I sleep? What am I struggling for? I have everything thing that I could possibly want right now and yet there is something missin...what is it? Maybe I am just too busy trying to find a problem that isn't there, ya know? I think most of it is because I can't see my hunny whenever I want to..and that really bothers me, I have been finding myself lying in my bed thinking about nothing but him and how much I want to see him and yet I know I can't just wake up and wait for him to call me so I can go hang with him and Cody, and so I thought that today I could go to K-Ville and see him but no I am not gonna get to do that...and it makes me sad..I know I am pathetic I can't be away from him for 5 days without missing him but hey you know what, that just shows how much   I   need   him...but anyways I think I am gonna go now and find something to do so I can stop thinking about all of this..soo I am out.. ~A*J

LoL I don't think i am petrified of bottle rockets anymore...I have been so close to them when they go off it doesn't really bother me anymore...but hey I am gonna go..lol...I'm OuT! ~A*J

      Hey Whats up? NMH..I am just waitin for my mom and Tay to get home from Florida, they are due back within the next hour soo...Like usual I was thinkin today and I was thinkin about where my life is goin and what direction I want it to go in..and then of course marraige and children popped in my head and well it is kinda scary to think that before I know it I will be married to a man that I am sure I will love b/c well I will be married to him and I will prolly have children and when I think about this stuff...it is wierd b/c I can't see it happening to me. You know how u can think about goin to a concert or somthin and u get that wierd feelin and u don't get to hyped about it and then later u find out that u can't go, u know what I mean...well ya it is like that. I can't see that happenin to me and I also can't see me having kids.....maybe that is just too far ahead for me to preminice. I dunno all I know is that well I will enventually find out. Now another thing I have been thinkin about is well my wieght, and I am not happy with the way I am or the way I look soo I believe that I am goin to prolly start losing a lot of wieght, now don't ask me how I am gonna do it b/c well ya'll will just bitch at me but I am bound and determined to get this wieght off me no matter what it takes, and that is just final. So well I am gonna go now I have to fold some clothes soo I'm OuT! ~A*J

      "I'm walkin away from the troubles in my life, I'm walkin away to find a better day" I am totally doing this last quote...I have decided worrying about shit and being upset over stupid things are just not me anymore..I am so walkin away. Latley the stupidest shit had upset me and I am literally just lettin myself crash for stuff that shouldn't really bother me, if I am having coniptions now about this stuff then think about what will happen to me when I get older..Damn I would like mentally kill me...ya sounds impossible but it can happen..and I am more than sure I could do it. But ne-waze my whole point is that my worryin days are over and it is now time for me to "Live it up!" so to say...soo well I am and I will continue to do so and I can only pray that I remember to keep my self out of these pot holes on this road called life...soo well I am OuT! ~A*J
