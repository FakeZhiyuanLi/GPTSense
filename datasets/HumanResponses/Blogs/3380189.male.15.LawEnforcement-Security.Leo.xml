       These are my opinions.  No one elses.  No one gave me the idea, I thought it up myself.  I will be talking about how I do not believe that all of the photos "taken in " Abu Gharib Prison, in Iraq are all really from the prison.  I am not a racist, and nothing I am saying reflects that of a racist.  I also apologize if I offend anyone, im not trying to.  Also, keep in mind, im not a good writer, so this is all a little unorthodox.  I dont mean to sound angry, im not, im just stating facts and ideas.  Not all of the pictures I am talking about I have shown, cause some are a little revealing.  Im guessing you know what ones Im talking about.   Yes, so i have seen several of the Iraqi Prisoner humiliation photos that took place at the Abu Gharib prison.  Some of these photos seem a little sketch to me however.  I mean, we are talking about suspected terrorists and allies to terrorists, just being slung over a rail, all by himself, with no guards, no handcuffs, nothing to stop him from maybe going back to the compunds.  Also, most of the pictures are insanely blury.  With all of the high-tech cameras journalists and the military use, what are the odds of the photos, looking like this. Not likely a lot.      Now, there are some pretty clear pictures such as:   But this shot seems unlikely as none of the soldiers have any type of weapons on them, and its also taken from a strange angle.  Up in the rafters of the building, but maybe its just a walkway.    This guy isnt being guarded at all.  Even I can get out of that mix.  And what is up with all the hoods?  You cant see the people, and even some of them look like white complexion.  I mean, arabic people do tend to have a darker complexion than a sheet of paper, but maybe its just the flash, or the lighting.  I would not know.    However, if this is so humiliating, and such a shame, there certainly seem to be tons and tons of former prisoners asking for interviews at trials, tv shows, and in the newspapers.  This of course, is all information from newspapers and internet websites, who do not show the men being interviewed, unless they are holding a sign with a bag over their heads.  Who knows if it is a hoax, or just the media influencing people again.  Also, we will never be able to know if the men being interviewed are real, or if they really are who they claim to be.  One guy, who apparently pointed himself out to USA Today journalists said that he knew who he was with a bag over his head, and he was so ashamed that he had to move out of his old neighborhood.  Now, who would know it was him, even himself?  And most prisoners who are being released look pretty darn happy to me, not ashamed to be with their old peers.    -One guy beating up 6 grown men all in civilian clothing.  Yeah right.  Ive also seen those moustache glasses at party city.  I have never heard of anyone wearing glasses while punching somone else.  The military does not allow facial hair, nor do they issue these type of glasses. I wonder how anyone sees anything in the dark without all the cameras flashing.  I like the handcuffs they use in these pictures.  Those things are broken by wind, trust me, ive used them on things before.  No way will they hold a grown man from breaking them, especially if he tenses up for a beating.    -Boy, this dog looks menacing...  Dont muslims generally have facial hair?  Not the guy above.  These "freed" prisoners do though, and look at the smiles on their faces after being completely humiliated:    Now, why exactly where these men being beaten?  They seem apparently to be so innocent and un harmful.  Also, the guard to prisoner ratio is about 354 to 1.  Who would have the time to just drag one or two out of a crowd and put them up naked with bags over their heads at random spots within a prison?  Would this not cause a revolt in the prison?  Cameramen seem to be going along nicely about it.  Just taking pictures of these terrible atrocities like there isnt a care in the world.  I mean, most of these are undated (could be a year ago), with no captions, no people responsible for taking the pictures, etc.  How did we not see them until now?  I mean, hundreds of pictures just comming out all at once.    What gets me, is not the amount of pictures taken by maybe 1 or 2 unkown cameramen at undated times inside the prison, but also that these soldiers just dont care that they are being shown to the entire world, beating, torturing, and humilating hundreds of "innocent" Iraqi prisoners.  No way in hell would I ever let someone take a picture of me giving a thumbs up sign at a dead body.  Duh these pictures are going to get out.  I cant even believe pictures were allowed to be taken.  This to me is dumber than the actual beatings.    Now, I do believe that many of the pictures are true, and that actual terrible events did occur inside the prison, I think its retarded to deny that.  Especially since soldiers are admitting to killing and harming the prisoners.  But I do not believe everything I hear, or see, and I am sure that many of these pictures are fakes, and just thrown in because of the media.  Some may even be from Saddams reign, or other prisons throughout the world that are holding terrorists, and the guards may not even be American.  Yet, I still say that some are just totally unreal.  Also, I do not understand how terrorists can claim that beheading an American citizen, who is trying to help Iraqis, with a miniture dagger/knife, is equal to the beating of a few prisoners.  Of course, all of this also happened in Afghanistan to the Russians way back, and there will probably be no end to it.  Many more Daniel Pearl's will come.  I think its a shame that stuff like this has happened, and we owe the Iraqis even more now, but really, some of this might have taken place a year ago, by soldiers who are already home, or who are no longer in charge of this.  The ratio from guards to prisoners is astounding, and there is no reason all of these men should be in prison at one time, no way at all.  Also, soldiers are not trained on how to deal with prisoners, and guard them.  They arn't, so they have to improvise.  Being bored to tears, and being around a lot of violent, angry people could get some one worked up and pissed off.  An idle mind is the devils workshop, or so they say.  Im not supporting the actions, but I think that the soldiers should not be completely blamed.  Right now, our government is just throwing them in to horrible situations, and that needs to stop.  We need to regroup and get things going smoothly again.  But its a little hard with terrorists blowing thing sup everywhere.  Thanks for the help.  Oh yeah, dont listen to everything the media says either.  They are a bunch of lying cock suckers.

      I guess it all started when I was walked in my first period class wendesday morning.  I heard firetrucks, and looked up.  Low and behold, a house behind our school was on fire.  I said to myself: "I know that Micheal Gugino was smoking weed again and set his house on fire."  Why?  Because Micheal was suspended, lives right behind the school, and smokes a lot of weed.  Hes also slightly retarded... Well, I think he is.  Anyways, here is the story:  So Micheal got suspended (I forget what for, it was awhile ago), and was at home.  Usually, people go over to his house before school and smoke weed or whatever, but I guess not this day.  He decided to mow his yard.  But, being himself, he decided to turn on the lawn mower inside his house.   Yeah, in his house!   So somehow he ended up spilling gasoline all over the floor.  I guess this wouldn't have been a problem, except there was a propane heater right above the spilled gas.  And yes, the propane caught the gas on fire, and there was a big explosion, causing a fire in his house.  So Micheal got suspended, and his mom said he should at least do something productive. So he burned his house down.  Oh yeah, this kinda grosses me out, and makes me laugh at the same time:

      Ok, so I guess this i my first post or whatever.  Anyways, as many of you know, I have always absolutly despised my Spanish 3 teacher, Ms. Crowell.  Not only has she managed to spend an entire year talking in spanish, but she has failed to teach me a single thing, besides spanish cuss words.  She has always been, and probably always will be, the sole reason I despise Mount Tabor.  A few stories about hell... i mean, Spanish class.  Fourth day since school came back from summer, and we took a review test.  I got a 100 on it, aced it like a hardcore gangsta aces death when he gets shot in the forehead on a drive-by (what?!?).  Yet, because I merely wrote "HC" with my signature under it, five points were reduced from my score.  However, no one in our class was awarded 5 points for writing the whole thing out, and she knew I didnt cheat, so I was pretty darn pissed off.  For about 15 minutes we got into a heated argument.  I saying that if I had missed all of the questions, and not written the honor code out, I would have gotten a -5.  She saying that it shouldnt matter cause it was only 5 points.  Then I rebuttled stating that if it was only five points, why take it off?  Back and forth it went.  Finally, I gave up, it was useless  Only after class did my friend Josh Skeena realize he didnt write the honor code at all and she hadnt said a word to him.  Living in the legacy of my brother...  Then, yesterday, we were going to watch a movie in class.  I sit close to the front and was watching her set up the VCR to the projector.  I noticed that the cables were in wrong. So I told her.  "No Adam, I set this up the other day and we got it to work fine, I just dont know what I did..."  So she began messing with all the buttons and controls and trying to figure stuff out.  But she really wasnt doing anything because nothing was changing.  So I mentioned the cables to her again.  "Listen Mr. Technology, if you think you know what to do, why don't you come up here."  (under my breath) "Ok, screw you, I dont care." "What?" "I know the cables are in wrong." "I don't think so." So she called the library and asked if she could trade projectors.  When she got the new projector, it started all over again.  We just sat there and watched her and this one girl almost cried because she was so bored.  Finally, with like 20 minutes left in class, she called and asked for help from one of those guys who never go to class, they just fix computers all day. "Ms. Crowell, you have the cables in wrong." "Adam, be quiet, someone is comming to help." "Whatever." So the guy came, walked in, took one look at the cords, switched them round, turned everything on, and walked out.  Needless to say, I was finally victorious, and Satan looked like Gis had thrown her in the lake of fire.  That all changed today, when, I came to her class in an awesome mood because we had had tons of fun in Mrs. Bailey's class before.  I was singing "Tear The Roof of the Sucker," by Parliament.  I casually asked her if she was a Parliament fan. "Yes, I love Parliament." "What?" "The band right?" "What?!?  You seriously like Parliament?" "I love funk music!" "Oh my God... Oh... my... god..."  And so ended the saga with Ms. Crowell.  However, she can still be a female dog at times.   OK, im tired of being pissed off now, but ill come back and post another story, as I have tons.

        Here is a small list of some of my favorite quotes.  Ranging from funny, to serious, to whatever.  Take them how you want.  They are in no particular order.    "Hey guys, see if you can lock me in the top locker!" - Jonathan Gregory (he stayed in there for 15 or 20 minutes)   "Come on guys, this is poker, you have to trust people." - AJ Vasilos   "Why don't you try taking your head, and stick it up your ass.  See, if it fits." - Scarface   Greg: "I believe in God, but I don't believe Jesus was our Messiah." John: "So Your Jewish?"  "KENDRICK!!!! FOR THE LAST TIME, STOP PUTTING YOUR HANDS ALL OVER HER FACE!!!" - Mr. Donnelly (Kendrick has a certian fetish where he has to touch girls or he will explode)   "God hates sin as much as a loving mother hates a malignant tumor that is destroying her child." - Weird Precher lady at Higher Ground   "Imagine this.  You are on an airplane, and God is the pilot.  You are traveling through the past landing at different airfields in certain times.  Suddenly, Satan hijacks the plane and takes you to an airfield during the Roman Empire..." - Weird Precher lady at Higher Ground   "ADAM!!!!! UNLOCK THIS CAR DOOR RIGHT NOW!!! IM TIRED OF YOUR FOOLISH GAMES!!! - My mom (even when I didnt lock the door, and wasnt doing anything, in front of all my friends.)   For more mottos go here:  urlLink    I used to have a weird hobby of collecting mottos, quotes, and sayings, but kinda fell off of it.  I know hundreds more.  If you havnt noticed, on the menu on the right, Im doing a new quote of the week thing.  All of them are inspirational and helpful (yeah right).  Feel free to comment and add some of your own, and if they are good, ill post them up.

      Well, because this is a very long post, I broke it up.  So feel free to click on one of the below links to be transported to that part of the post.   urlLink Birds  |  urlLink Party  |  urlLink Window Washing  |  urlLink Yard Work  |  urlLink Driving  |  urlLink Monday  |  urlLink Last Years Story    Well, summer started about 3 days ago, and lo and behold, its off to another crappy start.    Friday:  OK, well, Friday started off great.  I didnt have an exam 3rd period, so I didnt have to go all morning.  I sat at home and watched  The Big Lebowski , one of my favorite movies of all time.  Me and Scott had a virtual putt putt tournament that I won, and just chilled with my dog.  However, I do have a 6th period exam in the afternoon that I had to take.  Well, because its Honors Environmental Science, and only four people weren't seniors, it would have been really a waste to take it and sit in there for 3 hours.  So my awesome teacher Mrs. Snell said we could come and take it during lunch and leave whenever.  I finished the exam in 19 minutes and got home in less than an hour.  No More School.  Free at Last, Free at Last, Thank God Almighty, I was Free at Last!!!  The afternoon went by nice and slow.  I took Magy on a walk around the lake and worked out a little bit.  Christine was comming over to chill for the afternoon so I was looking forward to that I guess.  Plus, my mom had just bought some neopolitan ice cream sandwhiches and koolaid on the go drinks, so I was chowwing.  Christine came over and we watched part of  Held Up , another somewhat good movie.  I was having a good time, that was, until my dad came home.    So for the past few years since we have been living here, some birds decided to make a home out of our ventilation pipe.  It has been no big deal, and they never really caused a problem.  Sometimes its nice to sit and relax while listening to a bunch of baby birds singing, so we got along pretty well.  A few days earlier, I was mowing, and noticed one of the baby birds had fallen out of the nest and died.  I figured I would pick it up later and toss it into the woods, but I forgot.  No big deal.  Well, we began to have this horrible horrible stench comming out of the ventilation fan in our lower bathroom.  It had to be the birds.  Turns out, for some reason, all four birds were dead and decomposing, and another had fallen out of the nest.  Im sure they died when Scott was taking a slam and turned the fan on, sending his gases into their nest, though he denies it.  My dad decides since both Christine and Emily are here, its first day of summer, and its raining outside, that its the perfect time for me and Scott to help him pull out the nest.  As I said before, the birds had been there for a year or five, and so the nest went three feet back into our house.  Not only that, but they abused our hospitality and ripped the pipe to shreds, causing massive damage.  Build up of bird poop was everywhere, and not to mention dead birds.  Decomposing dead birds.  Apparently the parents had long been gone, probably used for shooting practice by me and Scott, and never came back.  The smell was disgusting, and when I had to get up there and try and pull some of the nest out I almost vomited.  But I decided against that I idea 'cause Scott was holding the ladder, and the wind was blowing, and I was about 30-40 feet up.  We managed to get all of that sorted out, and I went back to my movie, and my girlfriend.    Well, all of a sudden, Christine who is in the proccess of leaving, gets a phone call.  Its her friends.  Their having a birthday part for Jill/going away party for Jillian (whos moving to Georgia or South Carolina, or Nebraska or somewhere...).  Its strange because they only invited one boy, and about 45 girls.  "Hey Christine, bring your boyfriend cause there is only one guy, and it might be really boring."  So, 20 minutes before this thing starts, im invited.  "Cool", I think to myself, 2 guys and 45 girls.  Oh wait, forgot about the girlfriend thing.  "DOH!"  Now, this party is a little complicated.  Jill, whos birthday isnt for another week (but she wont be home then, i think), was invited to Jillian's house to watch a movie with a few girls.  Or so she thinks.  In fact, Jillian has handed out invitations to the party to nearly every single... I mean sophmore girl at Tabor.  Suprise party for Jill.  However, behind her back, Jillian's friends invite all the other girls from like 3 different schools to have a suprise party for her, since she is moving to like South Dakota or something.  So neither girl really knew what was going on.  Hence my therory girls like to make things as complicated as possible.  We're talking massive amounts of single sophmore girls.  Massive amounts.  "Pretty cool Adam," you are probably saying to yourself.  Well, not really.  First off is the girlfriend factor.  Now, I have a pretty long leash, so I can flirt and talk with other girls without getting a smack down.  However, im under a lot of pressure to act like the best gentlemen to Christine, and her circle of friends, because every girl in the county is watching me.  So I end up trying to balance about 5 drinks, and 5 plates of pizza and cake and distribute them to everyone.  Now, I get the reactions Im going for: "Wow Adam, you are so sweet," "Thanks A lot cutie," "I owe you for this one Adam."  Now im where I want to be.  I have a little freedom from the woman, and I dont hesitate to use this to the best of my abilities.  Striking up conversations and getting my "mac" on.  Im starting to get some flirtation looks, and lots of smiles.  I was even included into a conversation as an example of "sexy" (my hair and forearms).  That was sweet.  Now, because I dont understand girls at all, and never will, I cant really explain what happens next.  Apparently, whenever a bunch of girls get together, crazy stuff goes down or whatever.  Some of the girls started talking about real sexy dance moves they like to pull.  Now was the time when me and the other guy (dont know him), grab a coke, sit back, and watch.  So I dont have to go into detail, only one or two girls weren't wearing skirts, well, really short, tight, sexy skirts.  A bunch of booties started shakin' and crazy hip movements rockin, etc.  You get the deal.  So to get to the chase, many thongs, underwear, and even a no underwear moments were shared, which was really cool.  Girls were taking turns showing their moves off, and practicing stuff.  Nothing i could get it on.  I was having a really good time.  This time was cut short when about 15 hot sweaty girls decided to call it quits and head home.  Dang, ive got to go to!  Lots of goodbye hugs, from  alot of girls I dont know, and some I do, which is another girl thing I dont understand, and im out of there.  Not a bad day, I guess.  Besides the rainy, windy, smelly time I had with the birds.  And yet, summer is just beginning, and it gonna be nice.  Or so i think.   Saturday    Waking up early is natural for me.  The absolute latest I will ever sleep is about 8:30-8:45.  I just dont like to sleep late.  However, 4:30 is very early.  A little too early, and I just cant go back to sleep no matter what.  So that sucked.  Well, I have a pretty sweet job watering plants every morning at 7:00 for my neighbors every other day.  $20 a week, you do the math.  Im into the 3rd week of a 4 week vacation and so Ive got to be up at 7:00 on the first full day of summer vacation.  Not that bad.  I grab a liter and a half of water and chug it while watering plants.  Gotta stay hydrated in this summer heat.  About 8:00 and my dad figures its a Saturday, so we have to do yard work.  If you dont know my dad, he has me and Scott mowing twice a week, and every Saturday since it started to get warm (mid-April) we do yardwork for about 5 hours a day.  And not easy stuff either.  This Saturday turns out to be window washing day.  This is one of my most hated days of the year.  First we have to move furniture around to get to the windows.  Open the windows, take the screens out, label them if the label is off, and take them outside.  Because Scott had to "work," it was just me and dad for awhile.  Once we got all the screens out, I set about to washing them.  This took about an hour or two and then the real work begins.  Scott shows up just in time, to his disbelief, and we set to work.  The first windows are the ones on the back, on the roof.  So Scott gets a lawn chair, and sits in the yard and watches us work on the very hot shingles, 50-60 feet up.  My job is to clean as much of the gutters I can before the windows.  About 30 minutes later we are done, and I go back down and start all over again on a giant ladder.  Me and Scott take turns.  We go all the way around the house on all the levels and get all the windows.  Afterwards, the task of putting screens back in.  This is the worst part because some get warped by the weather and dont go in easily.  Im still living on the pizzas I had the night before, or in other words starving to death.  We finally finish at about 2:00.      At 2:30 I head on down to Ms. Keepler's yard, a lady down the street who wants me to edge her driveway, sidewalk, and street.  She failed to mention that it had never been edged before.  My edger is pretty old.  Very old actually.  We've been through a lot.  But we had never been through anything like Ms. Keepler's yard/hell.  In the hot sun, for 3 hours Im working on this yard filled with rocks, hard compacted clay, grass overhanging the concrete by about 5 inches, and everything horrible you can possibly imagine.  My engine overheats 3 times, and I go through 2 and a half tanks of gas edging this yard that would normally take me under 10 minutes if it was in good condition.  At least she was nice and brought me some water, however small the cup was.  After I finally finish edging, im completely exhausted, but Im not done until I blow all the stuff off the concrete.  And we're talking   a lot   of yard waste.  To my luck, the blower wont start.  It wont start!!!!  Great.  After a very long time of much pulling and tugging and vanity I get it started.  It took me 3 and a half hours to do that.  I got $30, but I felt I did more than that.  I go home and crash.  Literally.   Sunday    Im awakened at about 6:00 because my brother has 3 guys over going to the Coca-Cola 600 and they all have to get on my computer, in my room (because it is the only one that works in our house), and get directions.  That sucked.  But hey, at least I get to skip church.  Im so tired I wouldn't have been able to go to Higher Ground, even if I wanted to.  Which I didn't because Higher Ground blows worse than anything I have ever had to attend on a regular basis.  So Im thinking, cool, Im just gonna chill all day.  Nice!  But no, my plans are interrupted yet again.  My mom thinks that for some reason PE shorts are not considered bathing suits.  Where she got that idea, I have no clue.  So she and my dad drag me shopping to find something to wear at the pool.  As usual, spending even 30 minutes with my parents could drive even a trained government agent insane, and I am not immune.  Heres an example of us driving in the car:   Dad:   Ok son, nice and easy, theres a red light up here.  Watch out.  Mom:  Look out for that jogger!  Dad:  God damnit Beckie!!!  The jogger is on the other side of the road.  Stop pestering the boy.  Mom:  Don't tell me what to say.  I can say anything I want.  If I think he needs to look out fo....  Dad:  Shut the hell up!  Keep driving Adam.  Mom:   No Brent, I wont be quiet.  I have every right to tell him anything I want!!!  Me:  Dad, where do you want me to go.  I dont have a clue wher...  Dad:  Keep your eyes on the road!  Jesus Christ!!!  Mom:  Stop yelling at him!  Dad:  Hes going to kill us all.  Jesus Christ, your never going to get your license if I have anything to say about it.  Turn left up here.  Get in that lane, GET IN THAT LANE,  WHAT THE FUCKING HELL ARE YOU DOING, GET OVER THERE.  SLOW THE HELL DOWN.   Mom:  Brent, stop yelling, your not doing any good.  Dad:  Im trying to teach him how to drive.  Mom:  YELLING ISNT GOING TO DO ANYONE ANY GOOD!!!  Dad:  SHUT THE HELL UP!  About this time, my nerve has reached its snapping point and this means pretty bad driving as I have zero concentartion.   Dad:   JESUS CHRIST ALMIGHTY.  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING.   HEY BASATRD, GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY AND LEARN TO DRIVE YOU MORON!!!  (gives the guy next to us the bird)  Mom:  That was uncalled for Brent.  Im sure Adam does not want to be driving with you.  TURN HERE!!!  Me:  (slams on breaks to turn)  Dad:  WHAT THE HELL, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!?!?!  Me:  I DONT KNOW WHERE YOU WANT ME TO GO!!!  Dad:  DONT RAISE YOUR VOICE AT ME.  IVE BEEN DRIVING A LOT LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.  I DONT CARE IF YOU GET YOUR GOD DAMN LICENSE!!!  Mom:  You need to get in that lane and turn there.  Dad:  He cant get in that lane from here.  We'll have to circle around and do it all over again.  Christ, we'll never make it to this place.  Anyways, you get the jist of it.  So my parents have absolutly zero sense of style.  My mom likes all that surfer crap look.  Flowers and surfboards or what have you.  I do my best not to look like a flamming homosexual. My dad is lost in the 50s and thinks that bathing suits shouldnt go down halfway to your knees.  So they are pointing stuff out to me and im saying no, and they are getting pissed because im "so picky and spoiled."  All I want is a plain bathing suit, one color.  How difficult is that?  So we drive all over town looking for the best prices, for 3 hours.  Im wishing I had a drill I could stick in my ear but thats not going to happen.  3 hours later, I get home, completely exhausted and land on the couch.  I stay there for about 3 hours watching  Best In Show , an excellent movie.  My parents went out for a walk, so its time for me to work out.  Shoulders and neck today.  When thats all done I go to youth group, chill, come home and go to sleep.  An exciting day.   Monday    Its raining.  This is good because it means I can sleep another hour and dont have to water the plants.  But my anual summer cold is comming around again, and I coughed up a cupful of loogies stuck in my throat.  Its gonna be awhile before that goes away.  Well, I spend all morning doing some situps.  Gotta get ready for the beach in 2 weeks.  Again, my dad is home, so its back to the yard work.  Our edger isnt working (guilty look...)  Probably because I worked it to death saturday, and also because its as old as I am.  Dad was pretty pissed off.  So I use the manual edger and that went over like a fart in hell.  Then we hammer in some edging boards to contain the grass and Scott comes home.  He just got back, spent the night at our cousins mansion in Charlotte, and tells me about this babe he hooked up with the night before.  Hmmmm, what was I doing?  Listening to Brian give us a lecture on how the girls basketball team inspired a bunch of people in our church and etc..  Nothing I was involved in.  Im gonna miss Brian.  After he leaves at the end of June, we wont have a new youth director for probably a year.  Back to the dark ages, but that will be in a latter post.  So i come in and here I am talking to Nick Jennings on Aim, and typing this up.  My Dad wants me to paint the back porch all week.  This means Ill have to take the screens off, clean the banisters, paint the banisters, put the screens back on and so on...  My summer vacation is off to a great start.  Even worse than last years...    Last years story:  Its Wendesday afternoon, I have exams Thursday and Friday, and then, freedom from school.  I go to church for a "study break." Its just 2 hours or so where the youth hang out, eat junk food, play games, ect. I hadn't been there 15 minutes, and I'm playing a game of wiffleball, first base. This girl pops it up and I run to go get it, I dive to get out of her way, she jumps over me and kicks me in the face. Well, thats what I have been told. I don't remember anything at all, except eating pizza with my parents an hour before. I basically lost all my memory from the previous hour and a half.  Next thing I know, I wake up sitting on the front porch, bleeding from my nose everywhere, and my brother is on the phone with a nurse because I had stopped breathing. I'm like, "how did this all happen?" My brother had taken me home from church, and my parents weren't there, so we had to wait for them to get home, and then take me to the ER. I spend 6 hours there, have a cat scan, and turns out I had a mild concussion.  I get home around 1:00 in the morning.  I had to do my exams and everything.  First exam, at 7:45 was Economics.  Stangely enough, with a bloody nose, 4 hours of sleep, lots of drugs, and a killer headache I actually scored higher on his exam than any of his other students in any other class.  Pretty crazy.  My nosed stopped bleeding 5 days later.  So, i am back at church, three days later, and me and 3 other guys are playing ultimate frisbee. I go up to catch it, and come down, and my foot manages to slam into a cinderblock (i was barefoot, i am stupid ok), and I break my big toe. Of course, I can't tell my parents cause I am going to the beach with my gf the next day and they can't find out or I'll have to stay home. So I go to the beach, and have a great time, come back, and I have major strep throat. Can't do anything.  Lets move on now, my new DJ equipment comes two weeks and 3 days late.  Then, I still don't know my toe is broken, i just think it is jammed.  So Im still going to football practice everyday and running and stuff on it.  Its literally sending shockwaves of pain through my entire leg.  But my mom sees me limping everywhere and takes me to the doctor. I have a badly broken toe, and can't go to football practice for 8 weeks, and I cant do anything at all.     That was last years first 3 weeks of summer.  My highschool summers have not been to kind to me.  Hopefully, it will get better.  Im planning on it.  Tommorrow, im going to the biggest record store in town for a few hours of shopping for old records.  I cant wait.  But for now, I have to poop really bad, so ill post sometime later.

      My Grandfather forwarded this to me.  I am a military fan, so I decided I wanted to post this.  Please dont send me similar emails of junk and crap like this.  95% of the time I dont read forwarded stuff, and 99% of the time I dont forward the ones I read.  I just loved this and found it interesting.  I thought some people might enjoy this.  Here it is:  1. How many steps does the guard take during his walk across the tomb of the Unknowns and why?  21 steps. It alludes to the twenty-one gun salute, which is the highest honor given any military or foreign dignitary.   2. How long does he hesitate after his about face to begin his return walk and why?  21 seconds for the same reason as answer number 1.   3. Why are his gloves wet?  His gloves are moistened to prevent his losing his grip on the rifle.   4. Does he carry his rifle on the same shoulder all the time, and if not, why not?  He carries the rifle on the shoulder away from the tomb. After  his march across the path, he executes an about face, and moves the rifle to the outside shoulder.   5. How often are the guards changed?  Guards are changed every thirty minutes, twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year.   6. What are the physical traits of the guard limited to?  For a  person to  apply for guard duty at the tomb, he must be between 5' 10" and 6' 2" tall and his waist size cannot exceed 30."     Other requirements of the Guard:   They must commit 2 years of life to guard the tomb, live in a  barracks under the tomb, and cannot drink any alcohol on or off duty for the rest of their lives. They cannot swear in public for the rest of their lives and cannot disgrace the uniform {fighting} or the tomb in any way.  After two years, the guard is given a wreath pin that is worn on their lapel signifying they served as guard of the tomb. There are only 400 presently worn.  The guard must obey these rules for the rest of their lives or give up the wreath pin.  The shoes are specially made with very thick soles to keep the heat  and cold from their feet. There are metal heel plates that extend to the  top of  the  shoe in order to make the loud click as they come to a halt. There are  no  wrinkles, folds or lint on the uniform.  Guards dress for duty in front of a full-length mirror.  The first six months of duty a guard cannot talk to anyone, nor watch TV.  All off duty time is spent studying the 175 notable people laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. A guard must memorize who they are and where they are interred.  Among the notables are: President Taft, Joe E. Lewis {the  boxer} and Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy, {the most decorated soldier of WWII} of Hollywood fame.  Every guard spends five hours a day getting his uniforms ready for guard duty.  ETERNAL REST GRANT THEM O LORD, AND LET PERPETUAL LIGHT  SHINE UPON THEM.  I don't know if you saw this in the news but it really impressed me.  Funny, our US Senate/House took 2 days off as they couldn't work because of the expected storm.  On the ABC evening news, it was reported tonight that, because of the dangers from Hurricane Isabelle approaching Washington DC, the military members assigned the duty of guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier were given permission to suspend the assignment.  They respectfully declined the offer, "No way, Sir!"  Soaked to the skin, marching in the pelting rain of a tropical storm, they said that guarding the Tomb was not just an assignment, it was the highest honor that can be afforded to a serviceperson.  The tomb has been patrolled continuously, 24/7, since 1930.  I don't usually suggest that many emails be forwarded, but I'd be very proud if this one reached as many as possible.  We can be very proud of our young men and women in the service no matter where they serve.   God Bless them.

      OK, so I know I havnt posted here in ages and ages.  This isnt really my fault.  I tried to post about 2 weeks ago, but my blog want accessible for a few days because of some error or something, and then I had to leave for Daytona Beach.  That is a whole nother story, and Im sure Ill post that later today when I have more time.  However, I apologize for not being here.  Now that im home, I have a ton of stuff to do.  Namely getting back in shape and spending quality time with Maggie, and also my girlfriend (who came in and jumped on me at 9:00 this morning).  I also need to do a little updating here, which is fine.    Anyways, this post is about our youth director, Brian Loper.  Brian has been at our church for I think a little less than 2 years.  However, he is leaving now.    When I was in the 6th grade, we had a youth leader named John Hauser.  John was the man, and everyone really loved him a lot.  He was an excellent speaker and story teller, and an awesome Christian.  He ineracted with all of the youth, and everyone got along very well with him.  Bible studies were jammed pack full of people and we had the youth room packed every Sunday night and Sunday mornings to hear him speak to us.  One day he came to us at youth, and said that he had recived a message from God, and had to leave our church to go to a tiny little town in Iowa.  He claimed that God had come to him and given him a vision while he was praying one day and it told him that he needed to move on.  I later found out he was asked to leave by the members and pastors of our church because of several large disagreements between them and him.  That was about 4 years later though.    After John left, we kinda went into a dead zone.  Parents of our church tried to take over, and they also said we could be in charge of ourselves. This was an excellent idea.  One sunday night a month, we would meet in seperate groups with a few parents and discuss plans we had for the future of our youth ministries.  There were tons and tons of awesome ideas and the adults were pretty pleased.  However, because we were being run by volunteers, and could not do anything on our own without the church's permission or adult help, all of that fell through and nothing happened.  Youth was pretty much pointless, just silly games and a bunch of messes.  A lot of people stopped comming.  This lasted about a year.  We really needed a youth director.  So, the church hired Kathy Maston.  Kathy was newly married, and pretty much straight out of school.  I hate to be sexist, but women youth directors are lousy.  Guys can play games, such as basketball and football, with everyone, and get along with guys and gals, where Kathy just wanted to watch G rated movies with the middle school girls.  Instead of doing stuff our age, Kathy acted like she was running a day care service.  We painted all of the walls in our youth room bright neon colors, which to me, and most of everyone, looked like a club for homosexuals.  Every Sunday night, we had youth, and it was pointless beyond extreme.  Instead of getting up and talking to us about God and Jesus, we would play retarded games and sing the same 3 songs every night.  Needless to say, we pretty much lost almost our entire youth group during this period.  One day, some of us went to a seminar for youth about how to bring in and attract our friends to join us at our church every Sunday night.  There was about 15 of us, and 3 adults.  As we were eating our dinner out on the lawn of the college we were at, one of the adults got a call from someone at the Church.  Kathy had packed up all of her stuff and just left without letting anyone know.  2 years later we were told she was fired.  She was there for 7 months.  So again, we were back into a dark black pit which seemed impossible to get out of.  The parents while sometimes annoying, kept the youth at our church alive with retreats and special events.  Without their help, we would not be where we are today.  However, they were all volunteers, and asked for a long term youth director that would stay and guide us.  So we bagan hiring.  Meanwhile, we were still trying to recover from the after shocks of the Kathy era, and were really struggling.  There was two people at bible study.  Me and Dylan Ayuso, led by Jeff Livingood.  By far the best Bible Studies I have ever been to.  Im very thankful for Jeff's time and effort, even though he had a small audience.  We needed more though, and we needed to get back to where we were 3 years ago.  So we set up this thing called a leadership team.  I was voted onto it somehow, even though im not exactly popular and well known in our youth.  It went well, and we set up dates and plans and stuff for everything.  Things were looking a tad better.  Then the car accident happened.  Wes and Andy Burton, and Ryan Shoaf we all killed.  This tragedy brought our group together and gave us new confidence and reliability.  We were hurting, but we had each other, and that helped more than anything.  I was so happy to see everything looking great.  I was afraid that it wasnt going to last, but to my suprise for awhile, everything was going smoothly.  Our attendence numbers went up and people began to come more.  Thats when Brian showed up.  I wont go into detail of how we got Brian, because I dont know everything, and I dont want to guess.  Anyways, Brian came to our group in the middle of our mourning, and worked with it to help everyone become better christians and bring in more members.  Immediatly, people started to come back.  However, do to the repurcussions of past youth issues, there was a lot of senior high folk still absent.  I had just gotten into my freshman year, and there was not a whole lot of juniors or seniors who came.  A few, but not many.  This was tough on Brian, but we worked through it.  In most aspects, Brian helped out youth group grow.  We re-did our youth room, brought in new members, and helped everyone grow in faith.  The retreats were exceptionally good, and a whole lot more fun.  We had more involvement and activities besides on Sunday night.  There was basketball in the gym, picnics, and parties at peoples homes, and fun activities.  Youth took a turn for the better.  Brian had great games to play, and everyone had a good time on Sunday nights.  Everything went great for awhile.  Brian was an excellent speaker, and he made me realize a lot of things I would have never known.  He gave us more songs to sing, and brought us together a little through worship.  But not all he did was good.  He still kept the Youth Leadship Team, and promised us that he would use us.  However, at every meeting, we would have ideas, and they almost never went into effect.  Over time, there were never meetings, and nothing happened.  In my opinion, he could have really used us to help, but never did.  I thought we had a lot to offer.  Our youth group was pretty much broken up into small groups who hung out with only each other.  It was basically our way of survivng through the tough times.  Brian taught us that we needed to break this habit and reach out to other members and get to know everyone.  However, he didnt really live this himself.  About 15 or so senior high guys and girls became extremly close with him, very very close.  So close that he didnt really interact with most other people.  I knew he was trying, but he wasnt doing much.  I was not one of these close people.  A lot of my friends were, and we grew apart because of this.  The "inner group" would constantly hang out with one another and do things, a lot of it with Brian (a lot not also, but they had the bond that Brian had brought them closer.  This still goes on today).  I was kinda left out, and was never informed of these social meetings and events and grew away from it all.  I wasnt the only one who went through this, and attendence went down again, mainly because people felt excluded from everything that happened.  Thats really not fun.  Communication was poor, and basically these main people were the youth group.  I still did a few things with the guys, but it was really awkward.  They would be telling stories about the awesome things they had done the week before at someones house with Brian or just with themselves and the other "inner" people.  They would be like "man Adam, you should have been there."  I would just kinda stand there and listen thinking "yeah, I was home that night, you could have called me, I was bored out of my mind."  This caused me to kinda quit for a month or two.  It just wasnt fun anymore.  I didnt have anyone to really hang out with at youth, and a lot of the senior high girls for some reason didnt like me much, which left me even more secluded.  All of this is still going on, and getting worse, but I dont really care anymore.  Another thing I was really disappointed in was his lack of understanding he needed a little help.  When he first came, there was about 12 adults who always came and helped out every Sunday night.  Brian pretty much told all the parents he would not be needing them anymore, and he would hand select the ones he did want to help.  At the time, I was glad he did this.  I was a little sick of all the adults being around at our services and stuff trying to be all cool.  Only now am I aware of how much they really helped us.  Most of the people he chose, he chose because he knew them, and knew what they had to offer.  The others he just tossed to the side, and im sure they weren't pleased at all.  When he wasnt there, the parents really held us together.  They did their best, even if it wasnt what we wanted.  It was all they could do.  When Brian came, it was great to see a few go.  But now I really know how much they could have helped him, and how much we needed them.  Dont get me wrong, I was glad to see some go, and am still glad they are gone, but i also wish we had some of them back, and some of the ones he kept would go away.  Brian was always really stressed out about stuff, and some of them could have really helped if he had asked Im sure.  Im not sure if Brian was aware of this or not, but a lot of the adults really disagreed with some of the things he did, and were also upset about him cutting them loose.  This might have saved him some trouble down the road.  The church is the people, not the people who run it.  Brian also did not have any time for anyone.  This, I cannot blame him for at all, as it is not his fault.  He had a young family.  A family he needed to take care of.  I could never get mad at him for trying to spend time with his kids and wife instead of us.  I also got really pissed off at the church for dragging him into more than he could handle.  Not only did he have to do stuff with our youth group, but he had to preach on some Sundays to the church, and do certain tasks which I thought were a little to needy.  Our church really asked to much from him.  In return, he didnt really get what he wanted.  When we were trying to re-do our youth room, the church refused 80% of the things we had in mind, and didnt really give us a whole lot of money.  This was unfair.  Now Brian is going to a new church, right on a beach in a little paradise, with a youth room twice the size of ours, and 2 stories tall.  Not only that, but he can pretty much do whatever he wants to do with it.  Wonder why he is going?  We really took him for granted.  On a personal note, I have never really had any type of relationship with him at all.  Me and him have never had a chance to sit down and talk about things, and spend time together like a normal youth pastor would.  Tons of other kids got his time, but not me.  I felt shoved to the side.  One time, before the fall retreat, he came to me after youth and asked if I wanted to go to dinner with him one night.  I said sure, and he told me to call him.  Every night that week, I called his house leaving messages on the phone, and with Katherine Hupert once (who was babysitting his kids), telling him I was available whenever.  I went to his office once only to find him in a deep conversation with Stu and Drew, and I still left him a message on his door.  Not only did he not return any of my calls, but he didnt even speak to me for 3 more weeks.  That was beat up.  I didnt get mad at first because I know he was very busy, but when I learned he had taken other people to dinner, or had conversations with people, I felt very dissed.  It was like I wasnt as important as other youth.  The amount of work and involvement I had put into this group during the bad times and even when Brian was there seemed to amount to nothing.  About 2 months later, I really needed someone to talk to, so I called him up.  Left a message at his house, and at his office twice that week.  No returned calls.  So i gave up.  No use in involving myself in anything that had no respect for the time and effort I had put into it.  I still couldnt find myself to blame Brian.  Youth had gone downhill, and not only for me, but for a lot of other people who just wouldnt come anymore.  And that is where we are now.  Brian is leaving to go to a really nice church, where he has a lot of control, and we are again left leaderless and in the dirt.  I have just gotten back from an awesome worship experience in Daytona.  I went down early, with Scott and Cole, London, and the Herndons.  We had a pretty good time.  I went to work, and no play, so thats what i did.  The whole trip Brian was extremly stressed and pissy.  I cant blame him, but it really has not improved my opinion of him at all.  Brian is an awesome guy, christian, and leader that I have looked up to for help the past two years.  While recieving no recgonition for a lot of things from him, I have learned so much and will never forget the lessons he has taught me.  Hes patient and giving.  He did so much good for our youth group, it will be hard to replace him now.  Nearly impossible.  Still, he is leaving our youth group in shambles, with no new youth director on the radar, with an unfinished youth room, and a lot of angry kids and adults.  And yet, how can you blame him for leaving us?  Hes going to a beautiful town in Georgia, near all of his friends.  To an awesome church, that is giving him practically everything he needs.  His youth group is just a tad smaller, but probably more manageable.  He is starting fresh again, with more resources avaiable and im sure a little bit more support.  As far as pay goes, I dont know, but I have a inkling its a bit more if not the same.  Hes leaving a church that has been unsupportive and uncooperative to his requests, and does not give him the respect he deserves.  Im all tied up.  I wish he wouldnt leave for the youth group, but I dont have an urge to stop him.  Ive given up on ever getting anything done with our church.  I feel its time to move on, but I cant bring myself to do it.  To many memories I guess.  While at Daytona, my brother had an awesome idea.  Maybe we can start our own youth type program by ourselves.  That isnt run by the church, but by us.  A very very cool idea.  However, after thinking about it, it isnt fesible.  We dont have a place to meet at, and if its away from the church, we cant meet there.  We also dont have money to fund things, and its doubtful we ever will.  If its going to be run by us high school guys, you know there are going to be tons and tons of disagreements, problems, and issues that happen.  Every few years, we lose a leader and basically have to start over again.  We wont have a speaker or teacher every time we meet for inspiration either.  Ive got a feeling that its going to fall through.  Everyone seems hype about it and excited that we might do something, but im sure it will be a big let down.  I also have to say Scott is a horrible organizer, and constantly has ideas like this.  He gets halfway through them and gives up, mainly because he figures they will never work, or he has other things to do.  However, im just "Scotts Little Brother," so everything I say against him is either retarded or gay, even though I know him better than anyone else.  Just ask me to name some of his outrageous ideas without plan and ill be more than happy to tell you.  I love Scott, but its normally better to just keep my mouth shut and watch him screw up on his own, then I dont get beat up.  So I guess its back to the drawing board, and back to youth, to start over again for the 3rd time in 5 years.  Right now, we might not have a director for a year or so, and even if we do get one, the odds of him staying for more than 3 years is not very high.  The past 3 youth directors we have average about 2 years a peice.  Not to good.  At least I have 2 more years of high school.  And I thought these times at youth were supposed to be good times.  Anyways, I think im done rambling here.  Dont be offended if you read this.  It is only from my perspective, and quite honestly, I dont care if your offended.  I also dont know the entire details to everything, so a lot is from my point of view, and what I see and understand.  Thats all.

       &nbsp;  Yeah.  I really hate blogs.  Its been ages since I have posted,  But thats because the stupid blog people wouldnt ket me sign in cause of some copyright issues with Spank The Monkey.  Long story but it all worked out, and I got to keep Spankin'.  Ive got a lot to talk about, so prepare for some big posts sooner or later.    Anyways, my dad showed me this & I would like to share it until I get my thoughts in order.  1. The garden of Eden was in Iraq. (It sure doesn't look much like Paradise on earth today.) 2. Mesopotamia, which is now Iraq, was the cradle of  civilization! 3. Noah built the ark in Iraq. 4. The Tower of Babel was  in Iraq. 5. Abraham was from Ur, which is in Southern Iraq! 6. Isaac's  wife Rebekah is from Nahor which is in Iraq. 7. Jacob met Rachel in Iraq. 8. Jonah preached in Nineveh - which is in Iraq 9. Assyria, which was in  Iraq, conquered the ten tribes of Israel. 10. Amos cried out in Iraq. 11. Babylon, which is in Iraq, destroyed Jerusalem. 12. Daniel was in  the lion's den in Iraq! 13. The 3 Hebrew children were in the fire in Iraq. 14. Belshazzar, the King of Babylon saw the "writing on the wall" in Iraq. 15. Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, carried the captive Jews into Iraq. 16. Ezekiel preached in Iraq. 17. The wise men were from Iraq. 18. Peter preached in Iraq. 19. The "Empire of Man" described in Revelation is  called Babylon which was a city in Iraq.  Israel is the nation most often mentioned in the Bible. But do you know which nation is second? It is Iraq. However, that is not the name that is used in the Bible. The names used in the Bible are Babylon, Land of Shinar, and Mesopotamia.  The word Mesopotamia means between two rivers, because it is between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The name Iraq, means country with deeproots.  Indeed Iraq is a country! with deep roots and is very significant in the Bible.   e.g.* Eden was in Iraq--Genesis 2:10-14*  Adam & Eve were created  in Iraq--Genesis 2:7-8*  Satan made his first recorded appearance in  Iraq--Genesis 3:1-6*  Nimrod established Babylon & Tower of Babel was  built in Iraq--Genesis10:8-97 & 11:1-4*  The confusion of the languages  took place in Iraq--Genesis 11:5-11*  Abraham came from a city in Iraq-- Uhr  of the Chaldees (now Baghdad)--Genesis 11:31 & Acts 7:2-4*  Isaac's  bride came from Iraq--Genesis 24:3-4 & 10*  Jacob spent 20 years in  Iraq--Genesis 27:42-45 & 31:38*  The first world Empire was in  Iraq--Daniel 1:1-2 &2:36-38*  The greatest revival in history was in a  city in Iraq--Jonah 3*  The events of the book of Esther took place in  Iraq--Esther*  The book of Nahum was a prophecy against a city in  Iraq--Nahum*  The book or Revelation has prophecies against Babylon, which was the old name for the nation of Iraq--Revelation 17 & 18   No other nation, except Israel, has more history and prophecy associated with it than Iraq.  This is eerie.  This is something to think about! Since America is typically represented bald eagle. Saddam and Bin Laden should have read up on their Muslim passages.The following verse is from the Quran, (the Islamic Bible) Quran  (9:11) --For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah and lo, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced; for the wrath of the Eagle  cleansed the lands of Allah; and there was peace.(Note the verse number!)  Dunno if any of this is true, but its still cool all the same.

      Im building a bookshelf. This involves a lot of illegal and dangerous stuff, so bare with me.  First, about 2 weeks ago, I had to go get some wood. Because im 15, cant drive, and dont have any money, I had to find my own wood. Up the street there is a lot of house construction going on. So, one Sunday night (construction workers dont work on Sunday nights), I hoped in the volvo, went up the street, and got a load of wood from a house that was being built. Keep in mind I dont have my license.  So I built a bookshelf in about 6 hours. It was very very sturdy, and looked pretty good. But, it was to small. It had to go bigger. Trash that one, try again.  Again, another illegal trip to get wood that doesnt belong to me. Like an idiot, I had everything set up and ready, but I was barefoot. I thought to myself "Well, my shoes are all the way upstairs, and im all the way downstairs, i think ill be ok," cause im the biggest laziest bum in the world. According to my brother anyways. So I get out the power saw and saw everything pretty well. Time to put it all together. Im nailing in some peices together, and then uh oh, i drop a nail. No biggy. So I spin around to find it and  WHAM!  I kick the pile of wood with my foot.  Owwwwww...  As Im hobbling around trying to grab onto something, my hurt foot manages to find the nail I was looking for and it shoots up right into me. I yank it out and fall to the floor in defeat.  But, im a man, and pain is just temporary, so I drag myself off the floor, put a dirty old sock on to stop the bleeding, and finish the bookshelf.  Looks pretty good, but I ran out of wood, so Ill have to go get some more.  That wont take long either.  I also need to get some paint and... well, you probably dont care, so nevermind.  Im also in the process of buying a new guitar.  Im getting a small cittern.  Thats a smaller, traveling guitar.  Im going for a Troubadour, so ill have to order it from Romania.  It also has to be left handed cause I play guitar left handed (thats another story though).  Getting it lefthanded is going to cost about $50 more, so im looking at around $200.  Its so sweet and oh so sexy, so im looking forward to it.  Im asking it for my birthday but the odds of that happening are pretty much zero to none.  I was looking at buying a ukele, but ill hold off on that for awhile.  Gotta get my cittern.  Of course, the next instrument I want to play is the banjo, but those things are hella expensive.  Sorry i havnt posted in awhile, things have been busy over here.  Its also real late, and I dont want to preview this.  I hope I dont sound to stupid.
