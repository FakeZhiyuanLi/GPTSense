         I do not know if i said something wrong to her.. we met the other day.. watched a movie.. but i seemed to be stil in pain and unco-operative.. my feelings for her is not like before.. i used to be willing to follow everything she wanted.. now i seem to hav so little belief and faith in her.. but i still love her but not like before.. i'm hoping she tries to spice up our spark.. i'm too tired of fighting to keep her cos now i dunno who she really wants to be wit.. I'm scared of wat i dun comprehend..

         Eventually she broke up wit me.. reason i cant share wit u.. it was both our fault.. i was broken.. few weeks later she wanted to get back.. but suddenly we started arguing again.. it got called off.. i almost lost all hope of us being together again.. then the last week of 2nd term.. we started toking.. and the sweet thing is we got back together on da last day of skul.. we both were happy to hav found the solution and kept away our demons aside..

         Life was so nice wit her around.. though so many factors were disturbing, i was still in love wit her.. we had a huge argument and a few minor disagreement.. but still i didn't want to let go of her.. we both suffered from each other.. always avenging each other.. but i guess love conquered all.. we still stayed together no matter wat..

         I didn't tell effie dat i had broken up wit EM.. i didn't wan her to think dat i broke up cos of her interference.. i was glad i was single again.. i went out wit effie and her Form4 frens.. the mall in gdg.. watch movies.. window shopping.. etc.. we msg, call each other.. then i told her.. during 2nd term i was single.. she didn't believe.. the real reason was to find out abt her.. during dat time i investigated through her life..

         I made a girl fren after onli being in SAS 4 1 month.. jst call her EM.. a class mate.. we first met on the front entrance bench.. i jst finished football practice and went over to wait 4 my car.. she first spoke to me..we started toking.. and eventually she asked my no.. after abt 2 weeks of msg and toking to each other every single day.. i proposed and she accepted.. we were happy dat time.. but i did not completely check her background.. she's a very shy person.. but was two timing me.. i had met another girl.. effie.. jst days before i broke up wit EM.. i broke up wit EM.. 4 a damn good reason.. but one week later though.. i got back wit EM.. shit really stupid of me.. EM was stil two timing me.. but i gave her chance to break up wit dat guy.. she did not.. so i went single.. then i remembered abt Effie..
