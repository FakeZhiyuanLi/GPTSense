        urlLink        Grrrr....    Finally onto the camouflage, adding in the tiger stripes. This will take longer than I expected as it took me one whole night of painting just to finish the head unit. I think it would take longer if I intend to mask and airbrush.

      An exaggerated sms message i received one day:  "Oh!!! Luk at mi!!! Mi iz very guds at wrting shrthand. Mi tink iz so KuTe tat it wil impress the boyz wif tis kind of shrthand sms msg.  "OOoooOOOh Oh Oh!!! Lotsa luv and mi miz U 2....!!" ^_^  Can you understand such crap? Makes you wonder why we spend a quarter of our life in school. I used to think that spelling was such a waste of time, well it looks that way now does it?

        I wonder how many people realize that once a person comes out from his or her mother's vagina, we inherently have our ass owned. Like bulls being tagged with a scorching iron label showing that it belongs to a cattle owner, likewise, we have this invisible "I own your ass" label tagged on us.
