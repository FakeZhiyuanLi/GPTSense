      The past month or so I've been in what's known as Phase II training, where an AMIT (Assistant Manager in Training) learns how to do the manager part of the job.  Phase I is all about positions...procedures for register, grill, sandwiches, etc.  Phase II is ops leader, food cost management, labor, hiring, etc.  The manager portion.  Because I've been a shift supervisor before, Phase II for me has been a lot of fine tuning of ops.  Also, details about how certain things are done...truck order, for instance...have been explained, where previously I had to kinda guess and deduce.  Now, doing things like keeping a close eye on inventory and labor isn't just showing initiative...training isn't just a bonus...it's a required part of my job.  I went to a few classes up at the office, including orientation.  All about the correct way to do it.  The Wendy's vision...Dave's Way...the culture of the company.  Everything looked at in ideal conditions, etc.  Ignoring the fact that not everyone is equal, not everyone has the same drive.  Big pep talks mixed with some useful info.  Awesome and invigorating, especially for an idealist like myself.  At the same time...my training store has some serious staffing issues.  This made me take those ideals and twist, bend, or mutilate them until they fit the situation at hand.  To me, that's the difference between a good manager and a moron...looking at the ideals and saying, "I can't do that when blah and blah is going on!" instead of saying, "ok...we've got to let this fall by the wayside, and keep most of the ideal intact."  It's a game of compromise.  Next week...I'll be back in Union Centre.  We shall see how it all goes down.

      Sales: Average for a Sunday - About $2000 when I left at 8 Service Time: Also Average for a Sunday Biggie Size: My scores: Approx. 35%&nbsp;:: Store Totals: 23% Manager on Duty: I worked through both shift changes Quote of the Shift:&nbsp; "Do what with a potato?"  Business was par for the course today, it being a Sunday.&nbsp; Rushes came lightly and far in between without warning or cause.&nbsp; We also had a $76 order on front-line at 730.&nbsp;   Store operations were falling by a serious wayside as both crew and management were involved in political arguments and such--no, not Kerry v. Bush, but "Let's fire this guy" and "Let's write up that guy."&nbsp; Granted, this week has been a very poor one for attendance--one Mexican called a few days ago lying about a flat tire; another called off last night because he came in too early, then got too drunk to work later when he was supposed to be in.&nbsp; Another full-timer wasn't given any hours this week because he told off a manager because he claims his rights to use the phone online whenever he wants.&nbsp; Another veteran teen was given one 1130-2 shift for the coming week, because he is almost always too high to work, and calls off for one reason or another.&nbsp; We have another crew memeber who just didn't catch on to the whole job thing, and--well, we let him go today on job abandonment.&nbsp; To top it all off, we have another crew member whose girlfriend constantly hangs out in our dining room waiting for him to get off.&nbsp; One day, one of our managers got on this guy's back for not working, when the chick decided that she was gonna stand up for her man... Long story short, the manager vowed to make this guy's shift a living hell until the girl went home--he made him take out trash, slack fries, stock dressings, clean stuff... It all stopped as soon as she left.&nbsp;   All in all, attendance has been a big problem this week, and it has drastically affected operations, in more than the usual and immediate ways.  We also ran out of salads, after a faulty re-prep projection.&nbsp; Granted, we got slammed, but the closing manager decided that he just wasn't going to do another prep.&nbsp; So, no more salads... Always the problem.  In conclusion, this day was a monument to the consequences of faulty operations--no doubt about it.

      Sales: About $200 over projection Service Time:&nbsp;DP1= 86  DP2= 88;  DP3=  78 ;  DP4=98; Day Avg.=87 Biggie Size: Shitty--16% Manager on Duty: Melinda til 5; Tom to close Quote of the Shift: "Rapido!"  As you can see by the numbers, I am half-tempted to say, "Bow to me, I am drive-thru God!"&nbsp; That's right... only 2 seconds away from  record-breaking  service on daypart 3, from 2-5...   And who was the only consistent staff person on drive-thru all day?&nbsp;   I'm sorry, but as soon as Tom walked in, the shift went to pot...&nbsp; or rather, back to average... no records there.&nbsp; But I was damn proud of my accomplishments, and I got  fifteen  compliments from customers on service... "Damn, that was fast!"&nbsp; "You're ready before I am!"  It all goes to show you that with a little hard work, anything is possible.&nbsp; That 98... we pulled that off after getting a $40 order...&nbsp; All I have to say is "Booyah!"

      Sales: Mild. Service Time: 97 DP 4! (5-8) Biggie Size: 23% or so. Manager on Duty: Myself and Pablo, and well, Mitch was there for part of it. Quote of the Shift: "Have some faith, Pablo." &nbsp; So I pulled a mid today.&nbsp; 11-8, an actually short day, since it works out to be about 9 hours instead of the usual 10. &nbsp; My performance during lunch was mediocre.&nbsp; Service times were bad, I allowed the new fry person to get burned on nuggets a few times...fries a couple...*bah* &nbsp; Shift change went well tho...kept everyone focused.&nbsp; Then, when Pete came on-line and we got ready to rock and roll, it was all about getting the low service time.&nbsp; My whole focus was taking our average time from 115 to 88 seconds.&nbsp; Impossible, to be totally blunt...but...gotta have a goal. &nbsp; In my near insane desire to reach the lowest possible service time while still providing excellent service, I managed to infect this crew w/ a desire to succeed.&nbsp; People were bumping and sliding, dropping product w/o asking, making sure they ran their positions flawlessly.&nbsp; It was great to see these people enthused...usually, that just wasn't the case.&nbsp; Not from what I've seen down there. &nbsp; I just feel like I was worth the money they paid me today, always a good feeling.

      Sales:&nbsp; $4800 on the day Service Time:&nbsp; Day Average about 100, 135 for DP 6 Biggie Size: 24.00% Manager on Duty: Norbert  Well, our store was closed by the GM tonight... This is unusual in itself--the GM is supposed to be 100% dedicated to "systems," not "operations" (e.g. bills, not drive-thru).&nbsp; However, with one of our Shift Supervisors getting promoted and off at another store for training, and with another on vacation, you have to do what you can&nbsp;to get by. &nbsp; The night went fairly smoothly.&nbsp; This is the upside to having the GM close... almost everything is done by the book.&nbsp; Of course, this has its downsides as well.&nbsp; Our Hispanic employees became quickly fed up with new and pointless cleaning assignments, such as scrubbing the walls  behind  the upright freezer.&nbsp;  &nbsp; However, despite having the big boss in charge of late night sales, and having extra labor all the way, even into DP6, we were burned on meat eight times, service time sucked, and our wonderous GM decided that we could make salads to order once we ran out...&nbsp; Also, two kids meals is now officially a "complex" order. &nbsp; The long and short, however, was that the shift did run rather smoothly--with yelling and profanity only used sparingly.&nbsp; Plus, I got a big bonus... The GM explained to me his theories on staff management, and why everyone hates him, but they'll "thank him later."&nbsp;  &nbsp; In the end, the evening went off much better than expected,&nbsp;mainly due to&nbsp;the fact that our OL cheated by tacking on extra labor when it wasn't neccessary.&nbsp; *shrugs*&nbsp; Whatever floats the boat, I say.

      Sales: Low...$214 under projection, last time I was able to check. Service Time: Bad...119 DP 5 (8-10),  136  for DP 6 (10-1) Biggie Size: 23% of Combos Manager on Duty: Myself, Mitch for a bit, Janet all night w/ me. Quote of the Shift: "How's your chicken?"  ok.  So, when dealing with Theresea, we learn what happens to a shift when the manager is a putz and the crew good.  Last night, I discovered what happens when the manager is on the game and the crew are total crap.  I had this guy in the hole...taking orders and making change...who took about a minute to ring in the simplest of orders.  He'd take forever to answer the person at the speaker, for one thing...then he'd have them repeat things three times, ring stuff in wrong, and hurry them to the point they'd have to add stuff on at the window, throwing everyone off balance.  My sandwich maker...just crap.  She was so confused...so slow.  If something unexpected happened, she'd shut down.  Someone add sandwiches on to the order at the first window?  That means it's time to freak out.  Not make the sandwiches, but freak out.  She'd run out of product...chicken, bacon, buns.  Wraps for the sandwiches.  Even tomatoes at one point.  And when do I find out she needs this stuff?  After she runs out.  My other manager...Janet...was running grill.  She ran a chili meat grill, meaning she just loaded it up w/ meat so she wouldn't run out, and let it cook until I made her take it all off and start over.  And even using that system, we got burned (ran out) of meat at least three times.  She was also unable to get me fries, or to drop fries when we were running low.  I had to hold her hand just as much as the sandwich maker's.  And the customers didn't help.  The Wednesday prayer meeting at the big ass church up the road let out...and so, we had all the folks who were carpooling to and from church and couldn't be bothered to pay for their meals together.  That meant about 10 cars had two orders each, slowing us down to about 426 seconds per car for a while there.  I almost shit a brick.  Big orders...two per car...meant we were slow as hell.  And my people weren't up to thinking that hard.  But all things considered, the night could have been much worse.  I did manage to keep the time as low as possible, I think I can say with some honesty.  I learned some valuable lessons about grace under fire...watching product yourself, because some people are too stupid to bother.  I think I have grown as a manager, and it's a good thing to realize.

      Sales: $1600 or so by the time I left @ 4. Service Time: 91 DP 2 (11-2, lunch) Biggie Size: ...I was a bad ops and never checked. Manager on Duty: Myself, Mitch, and Keesha Quote of the Shift: "Woo hoo!"  Let's talk about calling in sick.  We had not one, but two people do that today.  One of which was an opener.  See, in this store the opening manager prepares the lettuce for sandwiches and salads.  Then, another crew opener makes the salads.  That crew member never showed up, meaning I had to haul ass and get lettuce cut, panned, and chopped up.  Then make salads.    That set us back so far we almost didn't open on time.  Some help from Mitch and the other opener, plus long forgotten salad skills pulled us through.  Still, lunch was iffy, because we were stretched thin, people were in unfamiliar positions.  Busier than usual, too.  Mitch was royally pissed tho...he's got this pet peeve about calling off.  He hates it.  He'd chopped the nuts off people who do it if he could.  I'm not quite that bad...I'm too understanding for my own good.  But still...there's a reason I've gone into work feeling like crap rather than call off.  Customers did get dealt with appropriately.  Except for front line...but at this store they put almost no priority on front line.  I kept running out of trays, 'cause there weren't enough people...*gah*  I hate not having resources.  So remember folks...DON'T CALL OFF!

      Service Time: 94 for Daypart 4 (1700-2000 Manager on Duty: Theresa/Tremain Quote of the Shift: "Fuck you too!"  Today was supposed to be a day off, but I was called in... I was never told why, but it's okay... The hours are nice when paychecks come around.  While Theresa was in, I was put on Sandwiches for the first time, having never been formally trained, but rather just using knowledge I've picked up.  Tremain came in though, and totally hates grill, so that's where I went until the closers came in at 2000.  Things were going well there--I was only burned once, and only for about 45 seconds.  I had a fun time, overall, but Tremain's micromanaging got on my nerves... He failed to offer positive encouragement to balance out his negative callouts.    Tonight was a prime example of a mediocre evening.  To the customer, things were running smoothly--food was hot, fresh, and promptly served.  Our dining room remained rather clean for most of the evening.  Inside, from the crew perspective, however, it was not quite so impressive.  Nonetheless, not terrible.  The store was not even close to "meltdown" status as we have seen it before, nor was it "Dave's Way" like it ought to be... rather, mediocre.  I shall not complain.

      Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the inside view on life working in a Wendy's.  The good, the bad, the just plain part of the job.  I personally love my job, as odd as it sounds, and I hope to convey that in my posts.  My name is John, and I'm an Assistant Manager in Training at Wendy's, and I've been with the company almost 2 years now.  From crew to middle management of a store now.  It irritates me how people seem to only see the bad side of the business, and not the good.  And of course, even when the business is bad...people forget to realize there are real people running these things, and to err is human.  Hopefully we can entertain you folks.

      Song in head: LAUNCH Radio Current Mood: Read to find out... What?  You think I'm just gonna give it away?  Pfff... Damn, son!  Ah, the fun it is to work at the museum.  Now that I only come in on Sundays, Linda is the only boss I consider to be a boss, except for Don, of course.  And it's nice, because we are both in the same boat about hating our jobs, etc.  Thus, I can pretty much get away with anything, it seems.  Yep, she tells me to go somewhere and, as long as it isn't an essential post, I don't really have to go.  It's great.  So, again, I didn't do any museum work all day, yet I still made my $5.15/hr.  I look at it this way--they don't pay me enough to actually do work, so I come in and I did my homework... Well, that is, when I wasn't talking to Kathleen or eating ice cream w/ Linda.  Indeed, fine stuff.    Nonetheless, APUS is giving me shit, as per usual.  At least I got the damn take-home test out of the way at work.  Thus, I only have the notecards to do, again, as per usual.  Damn, that brings up a point-- I really hate school anymore.  It just seems so pointless.  If I wasn't planning on college, I would so just drop out and grab a GED.  Oh well.  Mr. Business Administration here keeps dreading the taking of AP Calc next year, also.  *Blec*  I do, however, plan to take a year off.  Unless next year is ULTRA easy, I'm going to need it to gather my sanity, and build up some funds.  I want to drive a truck, but for some reason, I don't think that's going to happen.  So many trucking firms won't give us young'ns a chance, it seems.  Aber das ist nicht so schlecht vielleicht.  Thus, BAH!!  Oh yeah.    So, I got my paycheck from Kustom Music yesterday--$113.65... not too shabby.  Only one problem- Mary Anne didn't hand in my W-4 so I have to pay taxes... *arrggghh!!* Oh well- it will make for a nice little surprise of funds in Feb/Mar.    Well, I have to meet Mom for dinner... BBS to finish this monster

      Song in head: And So It Goes - Billy Joel Current Mood: Reeling it in  Ah, so many things to write about and so few ways to say them.  Let's just start off by stating the obvious.  It's the day before Thanksgiving (well, it was, now it is Thanksgiving, but the internal clock still says 26 Nov) and in 13 hours, I'll be driving out to cousing Vern's, off Kilby Rd. near E-Town.  Fun, probably not; Entertaining, perhaps; a good time, maybe.  I'm not sure.  Holidays and parties at Vern & Peg's are always... um... interesting.  Most of the family gets drunk, sucking back cases of Bud Light while playing cornhole and listening to WEBN or B105 blare off of the speakers in one of the pickup trucks.  There's usually someone passing a joint somewhere, and the kids love to play the slot machine that they have.  *oy*  Truly, reflections on an odd life, an odd life indeed.  Nonetheless, that will be Thanksgiving.  I'll probably leave the house around 1530, get there at about 1600.  Mom and I will be in separate cars so that I can leave at 7, get back home, and get some mofo-ing sleep before going in to Kustom Music the next day (Friday).  I'll work there indefinitely, possibly until close w/ a mid-day break.  Such a mess.  I hate Thanksgiving... but then, of course, I end up hating most holidays for one reason or another.  The only ones where I don't really have a beef are July 4, Christmas and New Years.  Valentines' Day, Mothers' Day, Father's Day, Sweetest Day... all the lovey-dovey ones.  Perhaps because they always bring me to the realization that I just don't have the people in my life to be lovey-dovey towards, thus making them not only pointless, but mildly depressing.  *shrugs*  It's late, I'm not in the best of moods... Shall I continue, though?  Of course!  So Mom gave me $50 a while ago for me to spend on clothes, and this morning I finally spent it.  It felt kinda nice, to have some nice clothes in my closet.  Every once in a blue moon, when I have an occasion to dress up for, I like to have stuff to wear, and now I do.  So that's nice.  Otherwise, what more is there to today?  Watched Christena all day, took a one-hour nap from 2 to 3 or so and had some funky dreams... another discussion, another day.  Details may be available upon request, depending on who you are and when you ask.  Otherwise, not much going on.  Went out for coffee with John, where we had an interesting discussion about "saving your napkins," or, in normal terms, good money management.  And the quote for the door "So the bank says: 'Ha!  We got all your napkins!  Whatcha gonna do about it, bitch!?!'"  Definitely a classic, or, as John said it, "Comedy Central material."  So then we drove around for awhile, but we switched cars... an interesting little oddity.  That was interesting.  I learned that some of the little qwerks that I hate about his driving can be attributed to his car... but at least Betsy has some pickup, lol.  Luckily, that Check Engine Light wasn't bothersome in LJ, except once.  Funny, when you're prepared for it and don't mind it, it never happens.  However, get a person in the car who thinks that they're going to die at the whim of a madman who shuts off his car and restarts it without stopping--bad for business, and the damn light will come on about 50 times.  *Bah!!*    So, you're still reading this, eh?  Damn, that's impressive.  It's 0320... man, I'm crazy.  So, for "The Last Page" of today's journal entry, we have a bunch of stuff that I could talk about, but are a tad bit too private to share over the internet.  After all, how many millions of people can actually read this if they really wanted to?  too many for my comfort to share my views and controversies about love and the like, both among family and others.  Like I said, reeling it in.  However, that doesn't mean that I understand it.  Unfortunately, I really can't elaborate, because I really don't know how.  Nonetheless, what a last page.  That actually kinda sucked.  No biggie, though, I have an excuse.  It's 0330 hrs now.  What the hell am I supposed to say?  I mean, I'm not exactly alert.    WHATEVER!!  I can no longer compose words in a structure consistent with that governing the English language, so I bid you adieu.  Damn, that's a good song!

      Song in head: The Scientist - Coldplay Current Mood:  Still peaceful, but a little happier  So, another day rolls on by... a pretty eventful one, though.  Got to skip English to go to the library to work on my research paper, had a Physics quiz (not really good), did some crap in Time to Speak (as usual), and had my first DBQ in Grunder's.  I dunno... for all that shit, and being ultra tired, it went pretty good in the end.  Went to Barnes & Noble, relaxed a bit... Went to Kathy's, vented about the retreat, then got some coffee, then went in to Kustom Music... where I sold 6 CDs (aw hecky yeah!).  Then, of course, I spent some time w/ Kathleen, which is always a nice little pick-me-up.  Oddly enough, however, El Junko was acting up pretty bad, violating our deal, and I was chastised for not calling my mother... Granted, she had every right to be pissed, and I don't know what I was thinking; Thus, idk.  but yeah.    Hey, though.... today was like a Friday, with a 5-day wknd!  YESS!!  However, I do have to watch Chris tomorrow (Weds.) and go to work at Kustom Music at 0700 on Friday.   Hmmm... oh well.  I refuse to ponder anything about stress right now.  It has been defenestrated.  so yeah.... Anyway, I'm really tired, falling asleep at the computer again, so I'm gonna cut it short.  More details available upon request.

      Song in head: Hotel California - The Eagles Current Mood: Peaceful  Oh, if I could only have a little pop up on my computer that said "Defenestration complete.  Please enjoy."  It feels so good, oddly enough, to not care about it - to throw it out the window.  Oh hell yeah...  And tomorrow is the makeshift Friday!  *dances around the room*  So yeah... I've kept you all in suspense I reckon, so I better get down to business...  So, I still haven't caught up with what was going on around the world with the exception that mass ppl rubbed it in that Marvin Lewis is going to the SuperBowl and that the Browns had 5 turnovers this wknd.... Like I care, but it's nice to harass Grunder.  So yeah, speaking of this past weekend... The YAC retreat will go down in history as THE ultimate roller coaster trip, opinion speaking.  In all, I guess it came out neutral.  Lots of drama, not good.  I don't know.  Well, actually, I do, and I'm going to take Kathleen's advice and ignore the fact that anyone even reads this shit (that is, if they do... lol) and just tell the whole f---ing story!  OK, well, the first thing that was sour was the fact that Kim was treating me like I was Kathy - with animosity, disrespect, distrust, meanness, ignorance, etc.  That got on my nerves and started practically before we left CMC.  Bah!!  But Don was being really cool, oddly enough, so it all balanced out.  So, then we pick up Robin... and I was so glad that she didn't get into our SUV.  You would not believe how glad.  Nonetheless, we move on to the chalet, which was creepy.  I started envisioning all of those creepy stories from the Vol. Coord. retreat some 9 mos. or whatever ago.  They all begin to make sense.  So, we start w/ unpacking and all that, do the first activity, etc.  No big deals there, except for the Giant Beaver issue... Don will never live that down, at least not on my watch.  So then the trip continues, I'm doing well, a little off/disappointed b/c my wknd was all fucked up - no driving around till 0100, etc.  The kicker was yet to come, though...  So the trip is like, well, a trip... It's fun, there's some bonding, and, as usual, it didn't go as expected. (They never do, at least from my perspective).  The biggest problem, ironically, was Kate.  Robin wasn't as much of a problem as I had anticipated, but Kate was stuck to me like glue.  It was really creepy... Never in my entire life have I had someone following me... everywhere!  EVERYWHERE!!!  I moved about a foot to my left, and her and Robin moved the exact same distance in the exact same direction!  I mean... it's one thing to have a crush on someone, and it's another to pursue that, but it's a whole different ball game when you get into stuff like that... that's stalking, in my opinion.  And, my friends, what do I do to stalkers?  I tell them off; one of my trademarks.  So, of course, afterwards, I sometimes beat myself up for it, b/c I feel that I really hurt someone, but it's simply defensive, I guess.  Nonetheless, Kate was no exception.  She didn't pick up the hints, she didn't listen when I told her nicely, didn't listen when I bluntly said what I was feeling, and thus had it coming to her to be chewed out for that kind of stuff.  I'm beyond caring... I don't need it.  All she did was make me feel more like I had to be on my toes w/ what I was doing, saying, etc., and she kept bringing up school... and she couldn't relax... BAH!!!  Thus, I couldn't achieve my goal of the weekend- to relax and have fun, and she bit the bullet for it... and I had every right to say what I did and throw what I did.  *sigh of relief - it's finally over*   So yeah... that was the main thing... The Jacob story for another time, another place.  That's a familiar drill already.    OK, well, I'm too tired now for a deep thought or current even reflection, or a quote... As Kathleen puts it so eloquently:  "Bah, gah, and erlack!"  So, good nite *snore*... Thanks for reading.

      Song in Head:  You May Be Right - Billy Joel Mood:  Happy  Well, at least I won't be using this as a vent session tonight... hopefully! ;-)  So, "How's your day?" he asks of himself.  "Well, not so good..."  "But you're so happy?"  "Oh, hell yeah... because I got all the hard shit out of the way now... for a while at least."  The fact that I bombed that APB Physics Test, and that the Norton test didn't go particularly well, either... none of that matters.  (Or at least I'm saying that!)  So yeah...  The OMNI-meeting... that was actually fun for once.  Perhaps it's because I didn't actually sit in the meeting.  Hmmm.  Well, it's not exactly a chin scratcher.  At least I skipped the Papa John's pizza *barf*  That shit is just plain disgusting to me now.  But, nonetheless, a CMC meeting means it's Wednesday, which means that it's only two more days until the weekend.  Of course, this isn't a true weekend... there is the YAC retreat, but I'm actually looking forward to that for some odd reason.  I guess it's just the change of pace.  And then next week is only two days long *SAWEEEET!!*  So... it's been a relatively good night, I reckon.  I didn't poison myself w/ pizza, and I feel like a free man w/o any Norton to read or any Physics to worry about.  YES!!!   So what's new in the world?  As I love on WEBN:  "So, Frog now searches the globe for any news worth interrupting the music.  Is there any?  Didn't think so."  So I hear they raided the Neverland ranch in California.  Stupid mofo, Mike Jackson, that is.  I mean, how much good action can you get from little boys anyway?  Raping a woman is one thing, sick enough.  And a guy... that's even worse.  But little boys?  What the hell was this mofo thinking?  He's a f---ing rock star!  I'm sure he can score all the ass he wants.  (No pun intended-- that referred to semi-conventional, heterosexual relations) ;-)  Then again, this is the same guy who used to be black, but now is white, and is trying to be a female.  ???  Some people are just sick and disturbing.  It's not my department, though; I sell kids' music.    So the royal college of England says:  "The microsurgical skills needed for a face transplant are already well established."  That's just wacky.  Yeah, think about it; transplanting a face.  Why?  Granted, they still say that they have a lot of progress to make, but still.  Why would anyone want to try?  "Just another tool for terrorists," says the brutal republican who believes that   everything   is a tool for terrorists, except old GW.  Feel free to check out the story  urlLink here .  So, in the words of The Crew Cuts:  SH-BOOM!  Deep thought of the day:  Definitions.  How can one word be given a single definition?  Or even words with many definitions, how can words be quantified in such a way?  Every word, although merely formed by a given set of predetermined symbols and making a sound with the lips, in combination with the tongue and voice box, has so many meanings.  Example:  normal.  can anyone define normal?  I mean, what is normal?  The thing is, this means something different to all of us (unless you're a part of that Christianity cult that rewards uniform thought)  In everyone's mind, normal pertains to a different set of character traits, qualities, lack thereof, etc.  Can you tell I wanted to write a position paper on this?  (It's on the list, but another story, another day)    Well, I guess I'm going to get out of here... Mr. Scalf wraps up another one.  TTFN, bis dann.

      Song in my head:  Sh-Boom - The Crew Cuts Mood:  uhh... confused  Well, I decided to try this new thing.  I've never really been a very open person, but everyone needs to change sometimes.  In case you can't tell by the title and description, this may just be the most confusing piece of sheiss you ever run into.  Of course, that kinda describes me...  I'm just one f---ed up kid, I guess.   However, I've known many who were worse, so I guess I could look at it positively (since counting my blessings is not up my alley).    All in all, if you know me, then some of it should click.  If you don't, well, you better get the skinny from someone because I don't want to try and explain me... that gets messy.  Nonetheless, now that the housekeeping is out of the way, I guess I can get started.  So, today falls, like a classic, into the crazy and confusing category, as do most of my days.  After carting my mom and sister to work and school, respectively, I was late by an hour and a half to school.  And, oddly enough, Mr. Punctual here has a bad wrap sheet for attendance this quarter.  Late 3-4 times... Absent twice... What is the world coming to?  I don't know.  For me, especially.  All things seem to be confusing, things that I seemed to know before.  I've lost all interest in school, unfortunately.  I know I have to finish, and I will, but it doesn't help when trying to arrange my true priorities.  In essence, it may be good.  For once, I finally get to be a teenager, like Kathy always told me to be.  Then again, I do see myself sliding backwards in ways that I never thought I would.  But herein lies the problem--I can't pinpoint hose ways in which I'm backsliding either.  It all becomes such a pain.    So what are my goals?  *shrugs*  At the moment, I have no idea.  Surviving until Xmas w/o a nervous breakdown would be nice, but we'll see.  ;-)  I have a couple goals, short-term, relatively speaking, but they require the aid and approval of others, and that gets messy.  Again, it all boils down to confusion.  What should I do?  How should I do it?  Should I just not care?  Am I taking everything as a mountain, even if not qualifying as a molehill?  Most likely, the latter-most is my problem.  As Kathy says, I should just f--- up, just so that I know that life goes on.  I'm not so sure though.    Well, it seems that Mr. Anti-social over here has become dependent upon his friends.... Now that's just scary.  I was always afraid of losing people, so I never really got close to anyone.  And, to a degree, I don't get close to many, but I do depend on the few I am close to.  Of course, that blows my plan that if I grow up to be an asshole, then I can just be a hermit.  I never liked that plan anyway, it was more of a justification than an actual thought.  It all is so funny though, in an odd way.  Hmmm... well, I guess I should move away from the self-examination/venting section.  Deep thought time...  So, how deep is something that is deep?  Does anyone really know how deep anything is (in a mental state, as opposed to a quantitative one)?  Depth seems to be more and more like one of those things that varies from person to person like a fingerprint; and even describing the same situations.  e.g.:  No matter how much I think I get along w/ Slickrock, I never do.  It's very odd.  However, I'm convinced that the conflict stems from differing opinions of the proper depth in our relationship (professional, not personal, you sick bastards).  He summed it up nicely with "I'll be friendly to you, but I won't be your friend."  This, more or less, shot down my theories on people altogether.  Again, though, depth.  So, this is Papa J, signing off.  If you enjoyed reading this, that's great, hope to see you as a regular; if not, well, sorry you wasted 10 minutes.  Oh well.  "The noblest dog of all is the hot dog, for it feeds the hand that bites it."  Am I the hot dog?  *scratches chin*

       Song in head:  Twinkle Twinkle Little Star  Current Mood:  Bored...  So, this is a first.  I'm so bored that I write in the blog.  This can only be bad for business.  Well, maybe not.  Only problem is, when I'm bored, I think, and that is never good in my case.    So my cousins are over, and they are annoying as fuck, so I'm making every attempt to tune them out.  However, they brought the keyboard downstairs right outside my room, so that's becoming difficult.  Hence, the Twinkle Little Star.    So, I'm like mass bored.  I'm so bored that it's fucking scary.  If I get any more bored, I think I'll become a piece of wood.  Shlagsahne!  Mmmm...  So, I'll continue to be bored, probably all night, because it sounds like everyone is making plans except for me.  Oddness.  Shit, $20,967.92... That's a lot of dough.  Broadway is still dark though, and the old man is still sitting in the Westsider up the street, waiting for his time to die.  HELP!!!!  I'M BORED!!!!  Another minute ticks by... tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock... except not ticking or tocking nearly that fast.  Time keeps moving slower as it goes on, it seems.  Shabba shabba shoo!!!  Does coffee sound good?  I suppose.  However, as Mr. Joel puts it, "They're sharing a drink they call lonliness, but it's better than drinking alone..." *musical interlude*  Hell, that sounds good, a drink.  Ack.  New Years' Eve thing tomorrow night... IDK if I'm up for so much bowling.  Maybe those seven Spaniards, along with the Indians and the black dudes... they may have a bull fighting competition which sounds like fun.  However, I'm not sure.   Whoa, damn... and you thought I was scary when I was hyper?  You aint seen nothing...  BOREDOM...   You know what?  I am so fucked!  I really can't have a good time by myself anymore!  I used to be able to, but now I'm so used to going out that I just, like, have to, it seems, to have a good time.  Damn.  I used to feel prepared for growing up and being all lonely... now I'm wondering if I still can do that.  *Scheissen*    "We are all born mad, some remain so."  --Samuel Beckett,  Waiting for Godot , 1954.

       Song in head:  Broadway - The Goo Goo Dolls  Current Mood:  As Jeremiah and I used to say, "Eh, crappy."  So I went to CMC today, went into FP for about an hour and a half, and couldn't stand it, so I changed out.  I'm so sick of that place.  Today was just shit.  I'm so glad I worked the open... If I can get away w/ it, I'll be doing that from now on.  If I can't, then back to the Herb strategy: "Fuck 'em."  They must not want my help.  Aye, so after that, I came home, which was... uneventful.  Mom and I ate dinner at Arby's and engaged in seemingly meaningless convos, then went to Target, where I bought some clothes, and she felt like shit b/c I asked her to pay for them and she said "No." *stamp*  She stole a couple things, then tried to blame me for it when we got home... *oy*  But, nonetheless, I got a cool hat out of it, even if it is "hot" for all the wrong reasons.  *train passes by*  So I think I've burned another hole, and not realized it until the cinge had already needed to be scraped off, but it's all good.  It wasn't a huge hole, one that should be repairable within little time at all.  Nonetheless, I need to stop that.  I tend to space out and just burn holes in shit... which is not a good thing.  You probably don't understand what I'm talking about, and that's OK, because I'm being intentionally vague again.  I love these little mind games.... I MUST keep you all guessing about something!  Otherwise, life would be too boring.  So I went to Barnes & Noble and checked out some stuff.  That was fun.  Bought a new CD, which I adore and have wanted for about 4 yrs now.  That is such good shit.  Plus, John met me there and we drove around til maybe 0100, so it was like old times.  Meeting in Kenwood, wasting gas, heading downtown, being approached by bums with ID's and malarkey stories... oh the memories.  Then the gas station attendant says "You look like you just got out of the Yukon with that hat."  Aye, she's an odd'un, but of course, I'm the one who parked too close to the pump and had to move the car, but didn't realize it till AFTER I picked the thing up, so it had to be reset, yadda yadda.  Tiredness.  So, Quote time...  "There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountain tops of our desires." --Nelson Mandela

       Song in head:   Current Mood:  Fair to Middling, kinda touchy.  Just don't fuck with me, or your ass will be kicked to Fountain Square and back.  So this time I'm going to start off with the quote, because it works better here... so HA!  "Change is the one constant in life." --Rosa Guy, U.S. Writer  Aye, this day has been an interesting one, it has.  Of course, so have the past few, but I didn't do the weblog on those days, so tough shit.  If you need details about something, let me know... There are ways of contacting me, ya know.  So, I'll go through today... It's not bad.  I woke up this morning at 0830/0900, after going to bed at 0215, so, once again, I forced myself to go back to sleep until about 1000.  At said time, I got up, got dressed, brushed my teeth, and all that, then headed to Starbucks downtown to burn up some more of that coffee money.  Then, moved thru the masses assembling for the fucking football game in order to arrive at the museum around 1050/1055 or so.  So I actually do some work... I go up to the front door from 11-1230.  Then eat lunch (or, rather, grab a free BigK soda).  Well, then the day became the usual.  I did chop up some cardboard for 30-45 mins, but then I just went down to the cabin to hang out for the remainder of my shift.  Shblah!!  Then Amber, Kathleen, and I start "planning" this road trip.  Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to see Chicago again, I'm with Kathleen in believing that it ain't gonna work.  Sorry, it just ain't no feasible.  ;-)  So then around 1545 after Amber and Kathleen have changed, I go up to clean up the scraps from the cardboard and then proceed to prep for departure.  Sat out in the parking lot for awhile talking (it was a gorgeous day) then went to Starbucks again (never too much coffee) and fought with the masses again on the way back to CMC (Kathleen was driving) but this time, much worse.  So I get back there around 1700 and then get the fuck out of there, since Linda was on her smoke break.  But that was work, and this is the fun part.  So, because I had mass time to kill and wasn't about to go back home yet, I called up Clare, who had told me to call her anyway before I went to Cheng's little gathering thingy, and I stopped by her grandma's house b/c they were having "The Larkin Party."  We chilled on the roof for awhile, then went to the actual party downstairs (but still on the 8th floor) and I was told all about the whole family, of which I retained so little (Sorry, I just wasn't that sharp)  I was creeped out by the fact that one of the Larkins was Mem Larkin, who is in my PreCal class... Odd, esp. b/c I couldn't say anything, b/c i don't really know her.  Odd...  So, anyway, back on kinda trackish looking thing here...  Swung on over to Cheng's house, which produced the deep thought and underlying theme-ish type whatsamahoosit... My old clique, the one from the summer... They were all there.  And I realized that I had totally moved on... I didn't hang out with these ppl at all (w/ the exception of Clare, but I gave her the ride over)  I mean, these ppl, Bauer, Mac, Robin, Holly, Cheng... they were my closest friends, and I haven't barely talked to them in what seems like ages.  CRAY-ZAY.  But nah... It brought me to the realization of how much has changed since school started... and it was so freaky that I almost went bonanza.  However, I feel a tad bit better now, just b/c I burned some time at the house and am now leaving again, YAY!  So I'm going to meet John for ice cream at UDF, big fun.  Until later, I leave you with yet another, rather amusing quotation from FEMA...  "Following a nuclear attack on the United States, the U.S. Postal Service plans to distribute Emergency Change of Address Cards." --Executive Order 11490 (1969)

      Song in head: Thankful Heart--Ebenezer Scrooge (played by Michael Caine in  The Muppet Christmas Carol ) Current Mood:  Good  So, I watched Chris again today... and John came over to finish his stories... That was fun.  I finally got to use some computer skills that I knew but never got to apply, and John finished his stuff, and I killed some time... It was great.  Even after Chris woke up (at 1330, mind you--how's that for clinical depression?) :-) things were going well.  Quite enjoyable.  Especially since I narrowly avoided steep arguments with mom by simply ending the convos.  I felt good about that because it was better for both of us to quit while we weren't so pissed.  And John gave me my $20 for Starbucks, which was nice.    Then we didn't go out to see Santa at the mall, but we did go out to Vern & Peg's around 1700.  I was looking forward to this one, for some reason, and it went very well.  It was nice and reassuring to know that I'm a hit with my family... They were in stiches half the time from my corny humor and impressions while playing Trivia Pursuit Junior.  (I was only reading the questions... LOL)  And making fun of my mom as she drank... That is always so funny.  She claims that it takes a lot for her to get tipsy or sick... NAH!  Who is she kidding?  Nonetheless, it was funny, and I really clicked with some of the adults (I'm too old to get along w/ the kids).  It was nice.  I also got $25 worth of gas and $40 cash out of the deal, so I'm happy. LOL.    I dunno... No matter how much I tell people, they just don't seem to understand that I'm much more of a giver than a receiver... I could care less for gifts, as long as there is a thought... A card, a "Merry Christmas," anything.  I don't need all that stuff to be happy.  It's funny, because Christmas this year has really made me realize that... and I love it.  But, anyway, to conclude the night, Dan came by today and left a MASSIVE box of presents for Christena... and a t-shirt for me.  It was a very nice gesture on his part, and it makes me feel as if the man does have a soul.  He was always nice on Christmas, which was cool.  He and I were a lot alike in some respects, and once a year we put all of our differences aside and focused on our similarities and really clicked.  Nonetheless, don't be fooled--I still hate the bastard overall.  Hell, He misspelled his daughter's name on some of the stuff... his own daughter.  That's just... sick.  Especially since he mispelled it on the cornerstone gift, which was a picture of him and David and Joseph (his two sons) with Christena's name on top of the picture... Spelled with an "I" instead of an "E."  *sigh*  Sometimes, just when you think he may be near OK, he does shit like that... Despicable.  But, nonetheless, I'm still excited for Christmas, which is going to be going down soon.  Oh hell yeah.  So I'll see everyone tomorrow or whatever soon after.   MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

      Song in head: Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) - Looking Glass Current Mood: Cranky & Depressed  Well, I just wrote this entry, and the fucking blogger lost it, so I'm gonna try and start over.  So it's now 2105 hrs, even later than the last time I wrote this, and mom still isn't home from work.  She was supposed to get off at 1700, but, of course, is still there.  Why should I be surprised?  I don't know... I just feel... so... used.  I'm sick of this shit... this "Oh, will you watch Christena?" and guilt-tripping me into doing it, then beefing it up without increasing my pay.  I'm so sick of it.  And, of course, I have to watch her tomorrow, which will be another day where I get to the end, like I am now, and will just reflect and feel that the past 18 or so hours have been a total waste of oxygen that could have been used by someone else to make use of their day, unlike I did.  Of course, it's not like I could have helped it, but I think I would feel better if I was puking my guts out or something... at least then I would have some excuse for being here... alone... all day... and wasting time.  *oy*  I called it, though, didn't I?  I said "She's gonna ruin my break." and sure enough, she certainly is.  I don't know.  Perhaps all I really want is a true, genuine "Thank you."  Maybe a showing of that, but just saying it would be enough.  Maybe what I really want is to know that mom would be just as willing to go out of her way to help me have a good day as I was a week ago on her birthday.  But see, aside from wasting the day, it also makes me sad that it's 23 Dec. and it feels less like Christmas than it did in July.  I mean, I have yet to see anyone whip out any holiday spirit.  There's no people caroling or wishing you "Happy Holidays," very few ppl with Christmas lights, there's no snow, it's not cold, no one is being nice or generous to each other (in fact, we're downright bitchy), there are no chocolate chip cookies, no early presents (which is my fault, but still), no Christmas specials on TV, no Christmas music, hell, even the goddamn tree is a bad memory, accelerated by the time trying to put the topper on last night.  *sigh*  It's really scary, not only because there isn't any holiday spirit, but because, if we can't be nice to each other at Christmas, when can we?  Never?  Am I going to go off to college in a year and a half and move half-way across the country with such a sour taste for my family that I will make conscious efforts to never contact them again until I'm 56?  It really scares me, but at the same time, really makes me more sad than anything.  I don't think that I've ever been so deeply saddened as I am right now... and that scares me further.    Maybe Micah was right... All I need is a hug.  "A good day.  A good day.  Is that such a difficult wish?  I'd trade a decade of bad days for just one good day... start to finish."  --Me, age 11

      Song in head:  Vatican Chant Music Current Mood:  Happy, indeed  So, it's really just now settling in that I'm on Xmas break... oh hell yeah, that is good shit.  Esp. b/c it's Sunday night, so I don't have to go to school tomorrow!  Oh yeah, I'm loving this.  Unfortunately, I have to listen to Mom rant right now.  About what?  I don't know.  Yet I'm writing this while she's standing right next to me, LOL.  I really don't care.  I'm sick of the hypersensitivity, so I'm gonna call it out.  So there, HAH!!  I really got fed up with it when she thought that it was a personal vendetta or something against her when Kathleen was busy tomorrow, so she couldn't babysit.  OY!!! *stamp*  Time to whip out the lemons, and find a nice tall flagpole.    But now mom is yelling/crying and getting really freaky-like oddness state.  I don't know WTF to say to her.  *stamp*  I knew this would happen... I called it.  "So, Joe, what are you gonna do tonight?"  "Well, I'll go home, and listen to mom bitch, but I don't have gas to drive around, and no money to buy more, and no money to do anything, really... So, I'll be with my family for awhile, and it will be total hell, as usual."    I guess the other bad part was that I left the CD with my blog entry on it (the one I did at Kustom Music--see Th 18 Dec) in the CD-ROM drive, so mom read it, of course.  And, as you know, that was light on the family-bashing, but it still REALLY got to her.  It's just so, like, shitty, dawg.  So that was the talk o' the morning earlier today.  *sigh*  I tell ya, if I didn't have the overwhelming balance of good stuff on the scale... I'd just be fucked.  But nonetheless, I do, so I'm REALLY still smiling :-D.  So, work was fun today, which was really good, because I was bound and determined to have a fun day today.  So I was glad with that.  However, I didn't tell Linda when I was leaving, or that I left, and I left on a bad note, and yeah.  However, that is so minor that it isn't even funny.  But, other than immature interpreters, that was the only low point of the day, really.  Okay, last bit... the rest goes into the non-web version...  Na... that will go in the non-web version too.  So, quote time - Both from Sam Shepard...  "Collaboration--that's the word producers use.  That means, don't forget to kiss ass from beginning to end." "Idaho decals.  Now who in the hell want to eat offa' plate with the State of Idaho starin' ya' in the face.  Every times ya' take a bite ya' get to see a little bit more."

      Song in head: I have one... but I don't know the name of it.  It's something new-rockish.  LOL Current Mood:  Tired, but still in a world-ownership belief  So, today was semi-cool, to a degree.  It went by really fast.  I woke up around 0930-1000 and went w/ Chris up to John Gray to help out Mom w/ her humongo account... for the Nashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.  (Herein... silly Indian tribe).  These are the guys who opened up the world's largest casino on their reservation in rural CT and turned boocoo profits.  What we were doing was setting up award packets for employees... those who had been there for 5 or 10 years.  They got a real nice pin, a congrats card, a letter from the tribal chairman, and an order form for their free stuff, which included many things, everything from a bike to rings to telescopes... you name it.  (Let me tell you... when I say boocoo profits, this means that every person in the tribe, not just the ones working in the casino,  every  person in the tribe, gets $80,000 per annum from the profits of this casino.  Yeah, a lot of dough, dawg.  So, anyway, there's about 1500 of these packets that must go out, and we have all the pieces, but they need to go into a box for each person... big job.  So I did that from 11-6 today (w/ a 1-hr lunch, which is a whole other story) and, apparently, did such a good job that they gave me a retroactive raise already... to $9/hr, and that applies to any day that I come in again too.  :-D  I was happy.  Hell, I was pleased w/ the $8, much less 9... oh yeah.   But then I get this frantic call from Mary Anne... "Joe, both of my printers are down and all I can do is take orders.  Joey (the guy who owns PlayNames in TX) is being a jerk, and Grant can't get up here, and I cannot figure this out.  Can you talk me thru it?"  So, of course I can't, but I feel bad, and I was getting fed up w/ mom, and Kathleen was at Bogart's and I hadn't made plans w/ John, or anybody else, so I was like, "Okay, well, I'm in Golf Manor, so I'm not too far... I can just stop up and take a look at it."  Well, long story short, I did, and ended up staying until 2150, despite it being my day off.  *sigh*  I got one printer working, but it sucks.  So she's going to buy another one tomorrow morning and get Grant to come hook it up b/c I said I couldn't do it.  (HA!  IN YOUR FACE!)  But yeah.    So, it was a profitable day, if you add it up.  I spent nothing, but raked in *does math on fingers* *says fuck this and uses a calculator* $72.25 before taxes.  oh yeah... awesome shit.  So I'm going to the museum tomorrow... I don't think I'm gonna chew out Linda for gabbing to Don; that seems just a tad cold-hearted.  But I won't be saying much, that's for sure.  And the radio show is going to be loads of fun...

      Song in head: Simple Plan - Perfect Current Mood: Does it Get Any Better?  So, oh hell yeah.... Got that project finished, finished my exams, it's winter break, made the Habitat deposit (w/o error, mind you), played a joke on Jan, my boss there, had a nice "chat" with Don (the only bad part of the day, really), went to Kathy's & had dinner, watched Everybody Loves Raymond and Jeopardy there, then drove all the way to Wal-Mart to pick up "snow stuff" in a can--I got the last one!--to help Kathleen, Megan, and Annie deck the xmas tree, then we vandalized the neighborhood with the snow can (since "snow stuff" referred to hats, gloves, etc.), then the hot chocolate boiled over and we had a hell of a time cleaning it up, then there was some talking.  I tell ya, combine all that with the feeling of knowing that there are no assignments over your head, that you have two weeks off, that it's all finally over... and damn, you have to ask:  "Does it Get Any Better Than This?"  And you know damn well that's something... I can't say that often.  Yeah, I suppose it  could  be better, but certainly not by much.  But yeah...  I will be heading off to work w/ mom tomorrow at John Gray on the Nashantucket account.  $8/hr... I am certainly not complaining.  Then afterwards, who knows?  If I don't find a bank to rob/ get money from, though, I'm gonna be fucked.  Well, I do have Monday off, don't I?  That will work.  So, no, even then... I'm still not fucked!  This is great! I am so loving this, that it's not even funny.  I'm so high on life!  WOOHOO!!  "There are two things to aim at in life:  first, to get what you want; and after that, to enjoy it.  Only the wisest o mankind achieve the second."      --Logan Pearsall Smith

      Song in head:  Amsterdam - Coldplay Current Mood:  It's crunch time, and I'm gonna be tired... Damn, can't wait to get started, can I? Secondary Mood:  *too many stamps*  So, it is now 2335 and I just got home at 2310 thanks to the fucking tarp and the brick house girl.  Oy gevalt.  So I have that history project that was due on Monday and pushed back to tomorrow... well, tomorrow is actually tomorrow now, so it's due, and I haven't done much.  Jarrett called me on my cell 6 times while I was at work, and I feel like shit b/c I ignored every single one.  Of course, it's my own damn fault, I opted to close on the night b4 the APUS exam... *stamp*  Anyway, I'll be dealing with the progression of American business 1492-1877 enough tonite.  As Brad said:  "Man, you're fucked.  You don't plan on sleeping tonight, do you?"  That kinda sums it up  But, that aside, I pissed off mom again... How?  IDK.  I walked in and I had to listen to the msgs on the phone, and she literally stood right over my shoulder, which was mondo-creepy, and I said this, and she blatantly ignored me--she looked at me, right in the eye, and didn't say anything, didn't do anything.  *stamp*  So I get a msg from James... he mocked me, which made me feel more like shit for not calling him.  *stamp to self* Got a call back on this car I called about, and the guy didn't tell me his asking price, despite my specific asking for it.  *stamp*  And finally, I got a call from Slickrock, inviting me in to CMC tomorrow afternoon to continue our little discussion from OMNI, but with Kristen present.  *stamp stamp stamp stamp*  *fills the page with stamps*  *still not enough stamps*  *runs out of red ink*  *orders a new stamp because he chucked the last one at the wall when it ran out of ink, hissing "stamp!"*  So work was, uh, interesting.  I stood there for 6 hrs and typed my blog entry and did some other random stuff.  The "brick house girl," as John termed her, was REALLY hitting on me.  (I, honestly, don't think she's all that, but I look for odd stuff)  I mean... I haven't seen someone this bowled over since that "experiment" over the summer.  (If you don't know the scoop, ask)  It was so odd, because even when I would walk to the other side of the cart to lock it up, she would just keep talking... and talking... and talking.  Oh yeah, did I mention she talked to me?  AAAARRRRR!!!  I tell ya, she certainly wasn't the sharpest nailfile in the pen holder.  "I can't believe this.  I'm having the worst day.  Jeff's wife was touching my ass and now I can't figure out how to put up the fucking tarp so now I'm gonna be out of here way late and I probably can't even find my fucking car because I'm like parked way out in west boofoo or something I mean there were like no parking spaces today and that was just like freaky."  I dunno... I egged her on just for fun.  I walked away and cracked up--the most hilarious thing I ever saw... OK, maybe not.  Kate and Robin moving 3 inches when I moved 3 inches... that still takes the cake.   So mom asks me tonite what exams i have tomorrow.  "History."  "Just history?"  *sighs* "Yes."  "So you have a half day?"  "Well, that was the plan."  *she ponders, then eerie silence, then stares at me*  "I don't read minds, talk to me here, ma."  "You know, Christena's school gets out early tomorrow."  "No, mom... I want my Friday."  "But it's so helpful to me, you don't understand."  "No, I do.  You don't understand the importance of the Friday night."  "But you go out every week."  "For a damn good reason--unlike you, I like to relax.  It's how I have the will to breathe from day to day."  *she stares at the floor for a while, then changes to another topic and further feels like shit and merely goes to bed*  See what I put up with?  But I'm still smiling :-D  Well, that's gonna be a pretty wired smile soon here... I'm gonna have to pull another "up til 4 and take a 2 hr nap" bits, I reckon.  *curses America and its history*  Really, I would kill it if I wouldn't take down Jarret w/ me.  I may have still gotten a B for the semester, despite the auto-C or less on the exam and maybe a C for the qtr.  However, I can't let a bud down like that, so I must charge on.  So, Kathleen is going to force sleep upon herself, and I'm going to force history upon myself, gonna buy some coffee, drink some Frappuccino, and make it work, dawg.    *crosses heart*  I promise I'll stop, Kathy, I promise.  I don't make promises for nothing.  It will be a New Years' Resolution... and I'm one of the few who keeps those.  I sure am gonna miss it though.  *sniffles*  My coffee has been a great friend.    HOLY SHIZNIT!!!  I am really crying... I was just joking before... now I'm REALLY crying... I am way too fucking tired, man.   OK, I'm really leaving now... but this last thing.  "My true soul" from that quiz.    You are naturally born with a gift, whether it be poetry, writing or song. You love beauty and creativity, and usually are highly intelligent. Others view you as mysterious and dreamy, yet also bold since you hold firm in your beliefs.     urlLink   What Type of Soul Do You Have ?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Song in head:  "Hola, Carter!" Current Mood:  Calm and Peaceful, Rather Happy  I typed this at work and burned it on a CD so now it's in here verbatim.  Enjoy.  Well, I really should, and kinda want to write about the past week, but it's not fresh in my head and it's not worth reminiscing for, so I may/may not get to it.  Most should be in the "crappy loop" anyhow.  So, I suppose I can get something out of the way now at work, since I know damn well that I won't be able to toinight.  So I'm behind on my blog entries... so sue me.  LOL.  I have excuses... It's been a busy little exam week and I decided that I was actually going to get some sleep before the monster tests.  Actually, I never study for exams, because it never fails that every single one is easier than I anticipate.  This year is no exception.  However, the week of typical slack shouldn't have been unfortunately.  I kinda tuned out a history project that was originally due on Monday, but extended to Friday, which is now tomorrow... so now I'm pretty close to screwed.  But na... I can BS it.  It's only 385 years of history on the rise of business in the American economy...  OK, maybe I am screwed.  Don't rub it in.  We shall see.  I've done it before and I can do it again; and NOTHING is gonna bring down my mood!! :-D  So, school has gone well this week.  I suppose it's been a week, though it feels like it's still Monday.  Time moving faster, however, is a good thing, because the fresh start that comes with the winter break has been my only real motivation to even go to school recently, so the sooner it comes the better.  In addition, the holidays usually bring time off, and I always feel more productive during my time off because I do what I want to do and say "Fuck off!" to everything else.  That's probably why last summer was soooo awesome, I got to do whatever the fuck I wanted and control my own life for once.  I wasn't at the mercy of some emotional, mother-like person or annoying, spoiled sister, or conceited balding principal or malignant English teacher, etc.  But, unfortunately, droogie aint playing that this year.  I have to watch Christena on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th... YES, Mom is choosing to work on Christmas Eve... *stamp*  It is a malenky bit odd, but I dunno; my big fat litso keeps on smiling :-D  So, in case you didn't pick up from the nadsat, I started reading that book that Kathleen gave me, A Clockwork Orange.  Very good so far, and I've only gotten through the first couple chapters.  Funny what things you can do when you finish exams 30mins to an hour early LOL.  Anyway, back to life, I reckon... I fucked up the deposit at Habitat once again.  Left one of the checks on the copier.  Thus, Jan told me to be more careful, but in a serious way instead of a joking way, since that's three deposit advices.  5th 3rd, in all their blood-sucking-ness, I'm sure, will say something about 3 in a row... it's just not good for business to fuck em up constantly.  However, in a way, it's a good thing, because it's neat to see myself chill out and relax, and be a stupid teenager.  It's pretty neat.    So, that may be all for now... It depends on if I get bored again here at the kiosk.  TTFN.

      Song in head: The Untitled (In the End) - Linkin Park Current Mood: Better than fairly tolerable   Well, it has certainly been a fun weekend, and somehow I've managed to take "screwing the family" to new heights, at least in their eyes.  Nonetheless, I've had one hell of a time the past few days.  Let's start with the end of last week... eh, wasted time.  I got my term paper done on time for Weds., but came in late on Thurs. and Fri.  I took a pop quiz in Physics on Friday on which I simply put a big question mark and the words "It's been one of those mornings." Bombed an APUS tes... I hadn't done the reading at all.  Then I went to Habitat, where I got a deposit advice from 5th-3rd (a bad thing).  Basically, that means that I fucked up last week's deposit, so we were $100 shorter than I had put down.  And, in another deposit, I left 3 checks on the copier, meaning that they didn't go into the bank, which means I'll get another deposit advice in a week or so.  *OY*  Oh well, though.    So then I pick up Micah and track down a bank to make this week's deposit, then meet mom in Mason for Chipolte, which really went sour, and I walked out of the restaurant w/ Micah and went to KTC to pick up my check.  This is when it starts to get better.   So I go to the mall and pick up my $161.45 and walk around the mall for a bit, then start to go home, then get a call from Kathleen asking us to meet her on Ludlow.  So we did, despite the fact that I had just cleaned out my wallet, my ashtray, and my acquaintance w/ the guy behind the couter at Starbucks.  (That's what happens when you order $7.50 worth of drinks and don't look in your wallet first.)  Anyhoo... that was loads of fun, and Kathleen and Micah finally met, which they've been meaning to do (using me as a medium, of course) for a long time now.  Then we drove around for a little while, but Kathleen had to go home, so that ended quickly.  So that went real well, and I was extremely hyper when I got home, to the point where mom asked Micah: "Where did he get the drugs and how do I clean him out."  Went to sleep around 0130/0200 I suppose.    Anyway, mom goes to work on Saturday, her day off, at 0600 (dumbass) so I have to watch Chris until 10, then take her to John Gray to "work" w/ my mom.  I also get a call from Mary Anne to run down to Florence Mall and pick up a printer.  So I get to Kenwood around 1400, despite being scheduled to start at 1200.  (But I got paid from 1100 on, so it's all good.)  So I worked, or rather, fixed the computers, then left at 1745, and went over to Kathleen's to help bake a cake.    I stayed there until 2345 or so, and welched, once again, on putting up the tree.  (I had to go to mom's work and wait for her, so I didn't get home until 0145 w/ the bad weather and all - There was no way I was going to trim a Christmas tree at 2 AM).  OK... and I'm rambling... So I'll cut to the chase.  CMC was fun, until the last hour, when Linda and I got into a "quasi-argument," as I call it.  Then I came home and argued with mom.  About what?  You guessed it... THE MOFO-ING CHRISTMAS TREE!!  Then I fell down the stairs, and went to the ER for X-Rays, then had to wait 2.5 hrs in the waiting room, so I said "fuck it" and went home without ever going back into the actual ER.  Had dinner at the chateau, put up some new quotes in my room, and, guess what?  The tree still isn't decked.    But yeah.  An excellent weekend if I do say so myself.  Certainly enough good to balance out the negatives, so I'm down with that.  Only one instructional day left, then exams, then winter break!!  HOOAH!!!  My grades may have dropped right at the end, which may sink me family-wise, but I don't give a fuck.  I'm gonna get two weeks off!! Isn't that so cool?  Oh hell yeah.    So, I bid you adieu... the one person who reads this... LOL....  There are more ppl out there who read it... that's what the shrink keeps telling me.  ;-)  j/k  TTFN  "I stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people.

      Song in head:  Random Classical Music Current Mood:   Tired, most of all.  Other than that, kinda depressed, kinda not.  Well, today was a waste of air breathed, at least until 1500 hrs.  I don't know.  I know that my life has never really been together, but the loosely glued pieces seem, once again, to be falling out of place.  This happened at one point last year.  Overall, it's a pretty depressing scenario, but then again, it isn't.  Partly because I don't care.  My priorities have done a big changeup since sophomore year, so it's a bit different.  I just feel like the guys on the Titanic, the string quartet that played until they drowned... It may be sucky, but I'm gonna get some good use of what's here.  I'm not sure.  And the cursor blinks... Why the hell do I write this thing?  Only one person reads it (which does mean quite a bit - thank you).  I can't really vent to it because it's still online for everyone to see... crazy shit.  But yeah... the life is definitely falling apart.  Family, school, work, car--most of the enchilade.  As for the other parts, I haven't yet decided whether they're falling apart or not.  This time off will do me some good.  Just knowing that the semester is behind me and that I can kinda start anew with school.  Now all I need to do is forget certain things that I've been trying to forget, and I'll be fine.  Focusing on positives is a good thing.  And--by the way--if, by some odd freaky phenomenon of nature, someone besides Kathleen or John is reading this, I'm not on the verge of committing suicide... get in the loop.  This is just me, tired, stressed, and finding myself not being destressed... no big deal.  *legal disclaimer complete*  Phew.    So was gibt's?  Ich weiss nicht.  The quote of the night is from U. A. Fanthorpe, (1929- ), British poet:  "Kind Dr. C, who is now dead, believed the best cure for depression was hope.  'Remember,' he said to me, in his most hopeful way, 'it is a self-limiting disease.  It will go.'  And so it does, as if it's got bored with me and wants to toy with somebody else."

      Song in head: The Road I'm On - 3 Doors Down Current Mood: How do they say it?  Oh yeah... good.  So, I'm supposed to write something here?  Hmmm... what a novel idea.  That is strange.  Well, oddness indeed, and as John would say:  "On a biscuit."  But Mom just got home and I have to do something w/ the family... so TTYL.

      Song in head: Low Rider - War Current Mood: Drained, like day-old spaghetti  So I went into work today, with all high hopes that today would be the start of a new week instead of a continuation of the previous.  Well, that was kinda true, and kinda not.  It all started off dropping my bottle of Strawberry cider in the CMC parking lot.  No big deal, really.  It wasn't expensive; I was carrying a lot of shit... No big deal at all.  Then I come up into the office and what to my wondering eyes should appear, but I'm once again not on the schedule.  Again, no big deal.  I'm used to it by now.  However, it was that stupid fucking email... I tell ya--it never fails.  Nonetheless, that was the main negative.  I did, however, feel a sense of some worth as I saw once again how I'm a bit of a mentor/leader of some of the kids on the team.  I do enjoy that.  Oy, though, the politics are simply sickening.  Today, overall, was a pretty good day, I suppose.  I didn't give the ultimatum speech, so I suppose that's good.   However, I am very tired.  The Encarta book is downstairs, so no quotes for you.  My brain is in... hmm... maybe... Maine.  Mmmm... Maine.  Snow.  Troubleless....  Aye, that would be nice.   Thus, that is the scoop.  Require more details?  Leave a comment.  Til later...  This has been the Really Messed Up Life of Joe, a kinda-sorta-daily publication of Joe Scalf, sponsored by Frobozz Electric.  Makers of the Frobozz Electric Totemizer.  Frobozz Electric--We bring good things to ourselves.  And the Grand Inquisitor reminds you:  "Never forget who is the boss of you.  ME!  I am the boss of you!"  Okay, so you got a quote anyway... but it wasn't from Encarta.  ;-)  Good nite, all.

      Song in head: New York Minute - The Eagles Current Mood:  I've had better weeks.  So, today has got to have been... how do they say it?  Oh yeah...  A BUST!!   OK, maybe not a total bust--I did get 4 free shots of espresso from Starbucks, won a game of checkers against myself, had dinner w/ Kathy at the chateau and learned how police radar guns work.  And, I earned my $6.50/hr for 5 hrs and sold 12 CDs at $0.50/ea.  Not too bad.  However, compared to recent Saturdays, this one was pretty sucky.  Nonetheless, though, relative to the past week, it wasn't too bad, in fact, damn good.  That's the sad part.  As Kathleen says it:  "Bah, Gah, and Erlack... all in one."    *****RANT COMPLETE***** *****FOR MORE DETAILS, POST COMMENT OR EMAIL*****  Time for more quotes from the Encarta book...  The following are from Henry Fielding, British novelist and playwright  -"Public schools are the nurseries of all vice and immorality."  -"One fool at least in every married couple." -"What is commonly called love, namely the desire of satisfying a voracious appetite with a certain quantity of delicate white human flesh."  Some you may know; from W.C. Fields:  "I exercise extreme self-control.  I never drink anything stronger than gin before breakfast." "I am free of all prejudice.  I hate everyone equally." "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.  Then quit.  No use being a damn fool about it." "Fish fuck in it." (His reason for not drinking water)  *****ENTRY COMPLETE*****

      Song in head:  Be Like That - 3 Doors Down Current Mood:  Lord, I hate that question  Well, so now I'm writing new stuff:  TONIGHT'S QUOTE "That which you love most in him (a friend) may be clearer in his absence." --Kahlil Gibran, Lebanese-born U.S. poet  Indeed, a person knows only what he/she knows, but seems to always try to know more.  Sometimes this gives that person the feeling of knowing something, while not realy knowing... or, in other words, a false sense of knowledge.  Aye, this can be quite a bad thing, to think you know something and then realize you had it all wrong.  The worst part of that is to find out that, while you had it all wrong, you made a shitload of mistakes... sometimes ones you can never take back.  While an underlying thought on the back burner, this philosophy doesn't bother me that much anymore, and hasn't for some time.  "The man who can own up to his error is greater than he who merely knows how to avoid making it." --Cardinal de Retz  Thus, I'd much rather fuck up, then learn from it, than never fuck up at all--so I take the risk.  However, sometimes you wonder how it might have been if the mistake hadn't been made at all; if you had gotten it right the first time... To only know what you know now, but earlier.  But, then again, there's always the "Shoulda, woulda, coulda."  Bottom line:  You didn't, and that's it.   So, that is tonight's deep thought.  Hope you enjoyed it.  As you can see, I'm already having fun w/ that quote book... LOL  (see prior entry for details)  "I have a long journey to take, and must bid the company farewell." --Sir Walter Raleigh's last words, 1618.

      Song in head: Be Like That - 3 Doors Down Current Mood: Lord, I hate that question  The following is what I wrote during my boredom at the mall:  "So I say 'Bah!'"  It should be the title of a book.  I dunno... I think it sounds cool.  Nonetheless, quite a bit has happened since my last blog entry.  I had another argument with Mom, but this time a little more heated....  It was like the deluxe compilation CD of all the prior arguments of the past few days.  So how heated was it?  Well, I drove away at 0030 hrs, went to the Chateau, and didn't get back until 0230; that may give you a hint.  Nonetheless, I got back and we had a nice freindly chat until 0345 or so and we seem to have resolved a bunch of stuff... or at least brought it up.  All in all, it wasn't too bad, I guess.  Probably the worst part of the whole ordeal is that I missed school today because there was no way that I could go through a 16-hour work/school day on 1.5 hours of sleep.  Aber... in deutsch wir sagen "Zu schlecht, Fritz!"  Wir sollen sehen; wir sollen wirklich.  (Sorry, I had to) ;-)  So I went up to Barnes and Noble before work today - they had some great bargains, so I purchased the Microsoft Encarta Book of Quotations.  Some 25,000 quotes, in hardback, for $9.98 down from $40.00.  Papa J was pleased.  However, B&N can only kill so much time.  Kathleen was prepping for her concert, so I went to Kathy's house and assembled a bookcase, then chatted for a while.  Perhaps the biggest topic of the convo was how her TB test came back positive.  Apparently, it's dormant right now, and there is "a wall around it."  However, in the event of some sickness or added stress, it can "break out of the wall" and become active.  IDK.  Seems like a simple enough solution... she's not contagious and has to take 6 mos. of meds (Down from a year if it was active).  All in all, not the biggest deal, but still a big deal.  Oh well.  Other than that, simply small talk.

      Song in head: Name - The Goo Goo Dolls Current Mood: ruehig (peaceful)  Aye, and another day passes in the life of Joe... a mighty interesting one, indeed.  I had stayed up late last night, so I woke up late this morning, and, of course, required my coffee to wake up (which my mom had stolen).  That may seem hard to do, esp. when mom doesn't like strong coffee... However, I had been to Starbucks earlier last night and had some of my Yukon left over.  It was cold, but a microwave fixes that.  Nonetheless, I wake up this morning and mom had ganked it!  So I say "What did you do w/ my coffee?"  She comes back with:  "You left it on the table, I thought you didn't care about it."  So, as steam blew from my ears, the only thought running through my head was "HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?!?  YOU DON'T  FUCK  WITH A MAN'S COFFEE!!!"  Nonetheless, I stopped at the chateau, and picked up my usual 20 w/ cream.  Mmmm... So then I have the strength to tackle the school day.  Eh, the day was, well, interesting.  Physics test got postponed... That was good shit.  However, we have to still take it tomorrow, then have a double bell two days consecutively.  Eh, no biggie.  I do still have to read the chapter and program my calculator w/ the eq.s though.  We'll see how it goes.  Again, a 50 is a B, so I prob. won't bomb it too bad.  I've def. become a B student in there recently; probably b/c I don't care and don't feel a need to put forth extra effort.  Sigh.  Also, I didn't get Schneider for Study Hall, I ended up w/ Christoph, the gym teacher who we used to call "Mr. Pistoph."  I've never seen such a mean, angry man in all of my life, and he's strict as hell.  So, I think that my days of cutting study hall are over, at least until next semester, when I may be able to pull off a work permit.  LOL.  I found today that we've actually gotten to something in math that I don't fully understand, so I'm probably fucked.  I can't learn anything in there, I just need the credit.  So, we'll see.  Test tomorrow in there - will he pull off another fascinator?  We'll have to see.... Then we actually talked about good stuff in APUS.  Good, beefy stuff.  The kinda stuff that makes history interesting.  To be honest, it's about time, and it can only go better from here.  Mr. 20th Century is gonna be cruisin a bit soon.  Oh yeah!  So then school was over, and Jonah and I sported over to CMC for the YAC mtg.  Of course, I was dreading it, like all YAC meetings, and, of course, we started off simply discussing the retreat... you know, the one I tried to forget about.... That turned me sour, and I really did walk out for 10 mins and was going to leave, but I did come back.  Glad I did, too, b/c we did Kristen's activity that was supposed to go on at the chalet, which really was pretty fun.  I had some fun, and softened up a bit to this whole YAC idea.  Of course, Agnew wasn't there, so that may have helped. ;-)  OOPS!  Did I say that?  So, then I leave the YAC mtg. at 6 to come home and watch Chris.  Well, they weren't home yet.  So I call mom on the cell, and she talks of bad traffic, but that's ok.  The kicker:  She comes in and asks me my top choices for colleges (I was watching Chris so that mom could attend a college planning workshop at the Nut).  Well, that's not a problem, except she wants a list, and in 30 secs, then gets pissed when I don't have it.  >:-0  ARGGHH!!  Well, that even isn't so bad except that we get into an argument b/c she thought my top choice was Michigan, which it hasn't been for at least 2 mos. now.  I switched back to good ole Emory, and I know I told her that on several occasions, but when I said... "NO... it's not..." she gets all indignant, like "When did this change?!?"  Then, it all blew up.  It turned into another "You never listen to me, do you?" argument and she argued that I never told her, b/c she could not possibly have forgotten it, and that I, obviously, as the teenager, must not have told her.  *rolls eyes*  That I hated.  Nonetheless, the night was OK, I reckon.  D-L-ed some very funny music, including the Irish folk tune about a drunk Scottsman... oh man, that was great.    Absolute big fun... so time for the deep thought:  Well... let me get back to ya on that one.   So, I reckon I'll be off fer me shave en haircut now.  That is, when mom gets back from the whatchamajigger. TTFN, my faithful audience.    "Wait, did I just call my friends 'faithful audience?'"  *slaps forehead*  Good night.

      Song in head: Make Believe Game - PlayNames Music Current Mood: Glad to be out of the hole...  So, although I haven't talked to this thing, it has definitely been an eventful 24 hours.  For those of you close enough to me (who are probably the only ones reading this shit - LOL) you probably know that I was really depressed.  It's so odd, though, the reasons why.  Well, not really.  I suppose that most of it was mom... saying shit.  Really killing my plans and beliefs, etc.  IDK - it's all so fucked up...   However, the oddest part of all is that school, and going to CHfH, and to work at the mall, all put me in a good mood.  I guess that I was down b/c I was so out of the rut, and I HATED it.  And furthermore, I can't STAND my family, so sitting in the house was doing absolutely no good.  Ah well... I just hope that I can escape this past Thnxgiving break and forget about it w/o feeling long-term repercussions.  I know that some of my actions were really, REALLY messed up, and were done out of emotion, and not really true.  And I'd like this entry to be both an apology and a thank you....  To those of you who were better than best friends thru all this, I wan't to first say "Thank you" for putting up with all of my shit.  Although it may not have been that hard for you, I know that it was annoying at best.  However, it means a lot to me that you would go out of your way to help me get through it.  It was simply nice to have ppl listen, I guess..  Also, at the same time, I want to apologize for all the shit that I did and said during that state of extreme depression.  It really wasn't me... it was an evil, mad mind gone haywire.  Simply try to ignore it all.  Again, I'm so sorry.  I owe everyone a steak dinner, not that it helps, but it's something. ;)  So, that said, I'm going to move on... On the road again... as if it never happened.  For the most part, a six-day wknd from hell, and if anyone from school asks, I had food poisoning.  So, did you hear the news?  Another black guy was beat up by cops... And where at?  The Chateau!  On Mitchell!  tsk tsk.  If you didn't hear about it, I'm sure you will, but if you want to get the heads up, you can see the video  urlLink here.   I refuse to dignify it with further comment.  Well, I guess that I should go get some rest, or at least a shower.  It is, after all, almost 2330.  YAC Meeting tomorrow, I'm supposed to cut out early at 1800 to watch Chris... We'll see how that goes.  Indeed we will.  Well, until next time, foks, this is Mr. Scalf, signing off for the night.  In the words of Jerry Springer:  "Take care of yourselves, and each other.  Good night."  As for Joe's final thought... I leave the lyrics of what is perhaps my favorite song.  Good nite all.  Come up to meet you Tell you Im sorry You dont know how lovely you are I had to find you Tell you I need you Tell you Ive set you apart Tell me your secrets And ask me your questions Oh, lets go back to the start Running in circles Calling tails Heads on a science apart  Nobody said it was easy Its such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard Oh, take me back to the start  I was just guessing  At numbers and figures Pulling the puzzles apart Questions of science Science and progress That dont speak as loud as my heart Tell me you love me Come back and haunt me I wanna rush to the start Running in circles Chasing tails Coming back as we are  Nobody said it was easy Oh, its such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard Im going back to the start  Ah-oooooo... Ah-oooooo... Ah-oooooo... Ah-oooooo.  If you don't know the song, send me an  urlLink email , I'll get you to hear it.

      Song in head: Fire and Rain - James Taylor Current Mood: Slipping into the Eighth Circle  So I took the day off.  I had reason to do so, or at least that's what I told my mom.  Amidst all of the yelling and shit this morning, I put on the face that I was extremely upset by it and that I couldn't pull it together.  Of course, I was still reeling from the discussion w/ Mom the prior night about lack of enthusiasm for school, so I had stayed up on AIM talking to John until 0230 hrs.  I decided not to mention that detail.  So I slept in until 1315 today, then worked on my APUS, then had to pick up Chris at school b/c Mom "wasn't feeling well."  Aye, this shit sucks mondo ass.    And, I still feel like shit for something that happened this weekend, or rather, didn't.  I feel like... I don't know.  Sometimes, I don't know what I want, and sometimes I know what I want, but not how to get there, so who knows?  Not I.

       Song in head:  This whole CD:  Red Hot Chili Peppers - Greatest Hits  Current Mood:  Blahze  Hmmm... another snow day.  Highly uneventful... Woke up at 0630 and had a quasi-argument with mom.  She mostly was just venting and PMS-ing, and she admitted it afterwards.  Listened to Morning Edition, like always.  Went to Kroger and bought some stuff for breakfast, including eggs, sausage, biscuits, bacon, bagels, etc.  Ate a bagel sandwich, watched some of The Price is Right, which just wasn't the same as it was when I was a young little boy.  Listened to some 97X, deciding that I had better enjoy it since it's going to be internet-only soon, now that they sold it to some beaucoup broadcasting firm.  Drafted my CMC resignation letter--two pages 12pt TNR.  Not sure yet whether I'll hand it in or not.  All good things must come to an end, it appears.  Then went to Habitat, ran some property taxes over to the County Admin Bldg. and did the deposit.  Then finished my taxes since they were out of stuff for me to do.  Then left, and sat in traffic for a long time on 75.  Went up to harass Johnathan at work.  Then swung over to K-Wood.  Visited the mall, talked with Jamie (the brick house girl).  That was fun to catch up.  She suggested that I get a job working for Gilson's LOL.  Hell, I was impressed that she even remembered me, so yeah.  I don't know... I'll never forget that job for as long as I live.  Definitely a unique experience... good times.  So now I'm on the prowl for a "real job" and a few other things.  I'll continue to listen to the new CD I bought today... It's so awesome (see above).    Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner Sometimes I feel like my only friend Is the city I live in,  The city of angels, Lonely as I am,  Together we cry.  I drive on her streets 'cause She's my companion I walk through her hills 'cause She knows who I am She sees my good deeds and  She kisses me windy I never worry Now that is a lie  I don't ever want to feel  Like I did that day Take me to the place I love Take me all the way  It's hard to believe That there's nobody out there It's hard to believe That I'm all alone At least I have here love The city she loves me Lonely as I am Thogether we cry  I don't ever want to feel Like I did that day Take me to the place I love Take me all the way  Under the bridge downtown Is where I drew some blood Under the bridge downtown I could not get enough Under the bridge downtown Forgot about my love Under the bridge downtown I gave my life away....  Genius, pure genius.  And damn good coincidence too.

       Song in head:   I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight - Foreigner  Current Mood:   Cranky  Okay... so I didn't go to school today on account of waking up at 0815 and not wanting to deal with the secretary to give me a tardy note.  Thus, I don't have my Palm Pilot back, and I spent the day at home... So much fun.  In order to counter my recent insomnia, I went back to sleep at 0820 and stayed asleep until 1420, whence I proceeded to vacuum the house in order to do something productive.  Otherwise, I did nothing.  Watched COPS and ate some breakfast, then waited 5 minutes, and had lunch.  At one point, I was so bored that I decided to spike my Kool-Aid.  It actually wasn't that bad, and I relaxed a little, so alles gute.    Mom got home around 1900, and was only slightly irked that I didn't attend school, moreso at the fact that I didn't call her.  She is still bothered at the fact that I don't bleed my problems to her.  Why should I?  I didn't, and still don't care.  Thus, I made dinner and did the dishes as usual, but was still cranky... Bleh.  That brings me to now, where I'm briefly listening to WMP whilst I write, then moving to the TV to watch CSI: and ER.  Odds are, I will be on the computer again later, and won't be able to sleep again tonight.  We shall see.  *rubs beard on chin*  Mom:  This dinner is very good, Joseph.  We've voted to have you make it the next time we eat it. Joe (while washing dishes):  Well, the trick to hamburger helper is to stir up all the mixes with the water before you put it in the pan.  Then it doesn't clump up. Christena:  Well, there's one secret ingredient that mommy can add that Joseph can't... Mom:  That's right, I fill it with lots of love! Christena:  Yeah, that's it! Joe:  *chuckles*  No, I don't do love well, that's for sure. Mom:  No, you are just trying to convince us that you are a mean callous person, while you really are a loving, caring person. Joe:  *sighs and shakes head, returns to dishes*

       Song in head:  Don't Stop Believing - Journey  Current Mood:     Hah.  You know, I don't know how I'm feeling.  I'm sure that physically my body is so drained that it feels like a dried up ocean.  Yet, at the same time, there's a whole multitude of emotions flying about.    Tonight's Law & Order was about a 79 year-old man who becomes a victim of identity theft, has his whole livelihood stolen away from him, and then kills the guy that did it.  However, the story is very interesting in that this old man covers up the whole thing, trying to make it look like he did it all, because he feared embarassment, mostly from his own son.  Definitely powerful, and, in my mind, a masterpiece.  It makes you wonder, how someone can be so despicable to do something like that and take advantage of an elderly man.  But, the guy had lost his job and didn't tell his wife, and he was laid off due to economic problems... It's all a circle of Bushisms.  I came across a book that I never read last night.  Mom had given it to me as a present.  It's full of poems, entitled  To My Son with Love .  Typical mushy stuff, that's probably why I "misplaced" it.  However, the first page I opened to were these two poems:  Many people go from on thing to another searching for happiness, but with each new venture they find themselves more confused and less happy until they discover that what they are searching for is inside themselves and what will make them happy is sharing their real selves with the ones they love.  Don't be afraid to love someone totally and completely.  Love is the most fulfilling and beautiful feeling in the world.  Don't be afraid that you will get hurt or that the other person won't love you as much.  There is a risk in everything you do and the rewards are never as great as what love can bring.  So let yourself get involved completely and honestly and enjoy the possibility that what happens might be the only real source of happiness.    We watched a video in Meteorology on Friday.  The opening consisted of some pictures of the weather (rain, clouds, etc.) and then the host saying "Nature and all of the things around us are so divinely simple, yet at the same time are so scientifically complex."  All of this is so odd.  Especially finding this book, and those two "proverbs" being the page that I randomly open to.  I suppose that this is all a part of that "personal journey" that I'm apparently on.  Unfortunately, the things that are bothering me are no longer dilemmas, but rather memories--memories of so many things, flashbacks to so many moments.  Those two poems sound like stuff that my mother would say.  They are mushy, open-book type junk; this is the kind of stuff that I live to ignore, generally.  However, despite my downfalls, trials, and tribulations, I find parts of them in me, and I see myself portraying them in some respects.  Nonetheless, it's out of my control.  I put it all on the line, and I lost.  Plain and simple.  You make bets at the racetrack, some of them sure bets, some of them longshots.  Every now and then, you shoot for that longshot, because although the chances are slim, the payoff is superb.  I won't lie... it hurts.  It hurts a lot, but it was something that just was and is, and sooner or later, one must come to grips with reality.  Truth hurts, sometimes, you know?  Granted, I'm a cynic, I will admit, and I'm pretty paranoid, but I'm not stupid.   Stuff like this just makes me wonder sometimes.  "When a diplomat says yes, he means perhaps.  When he says perhaps, he means no.  When he says no, he is not a diplomat.  When a lady says no, she means perhaps.  When she says perhaps, she means yes.  But when she says yes, she is no lady."  -Lord A. T. Denning

       Song in head:  The Grouch - Green Day  Current Mood:  Pissed  Ha... day from hell has hence been redefined as January 27, 2003.  But this is my battle, meant for the army of the one and only Joe Scalf.  These are no one else's problems but my own.  Hence, I shall fight them and deal with them by myself.  And if I become more of a dickhead, and the steel plating becomes thicker, and I resemble Ebenezer Scrooge even more, then so be it.  I have one thing to say:  Watch out world, because here comes one bitter fucking old man.  I was a young boy that had big plans Now I'm just another shitty old man I don't have fun and I hate everything The world owes me so fuck you Glory days don't mean shit to me I drank a six pack of apathy Life's a bitch and so am I The world owes me so fuck you  Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals I had a young and optimistic point of view Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals I had a young and optimistic point of view  I decomposed yet my gut's getting fat Oh my god I'm turning out like my dad I'm always rude I got a bad attitude The world owes me so fuck you The wife's a nag and the kid's fucking up I don't have sex cause I can't get it up I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch The world owes me so fuck you  Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals I had a young and optimistic point of view Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals I had a young and optimistic point of view So now you know  I was a young boy that had big plans Now I'm just another shitty old man I don't have fun and I hate everything The world owes me so fuck you Glory days don't mean shit to me I drank a six pack of apathy Life's a bitch and so am I The world owes me so fuck you The world owes me so fuck you The world owes me so fuck you!

       Song in head:  Blue Monday - WVXU 91.7  Current Mood:  Amazingly happy  Okay, so last night I was all pissed off because I knew I had a day off and that I couldn't do anything with it because I would have to watch my sister.  Thus, I actually brought this up to my mom, which met heavy emotional backlash on her part, but I couldn't care less.  Point blank, she said she'd watch Chris today, and that's what happened.  I slept in until 1250, which was entirely too much sleep, but alles gute.  It finally dawned on me that I finally had "left it all behind" and moved on, with several things.  Thus, I woke up with a good attitude.  However, I went upstairs, and met with that motherly-like figure, which was disaster, because I didn't want to play in the snow.  *shakes head*  Silly biotch, if she would pay attention to her own goddamn son enough to know that he just got over a cold, then she would know why the fuck I didn't want to play outside for hours.  *looks skyward*  That's ok... she's too emo for me, and I'm just fine if she leaves me alone, because I'm generally in a better mood if she does.  *jams to the blues on the radio*    You know I realized something this morning-- I'm not too much different than everybody else.  I'm still driven by a lot of the same principles that they are, I just hide some of them well.  Thus, some of the same conclusions that others have come to, and the boats that they have been in, well, I can come to those and be in those too, and it's just a-ok.  LOL.  A gold star for whoever figures it out... it's like that impossible puzzle that Kathy and I were working on this evening... the one with 400 pieces, but no flat edge, and 5 extras, and no picture on the box of what it's supposed to look like.  I tell ya, that woman likes a challenge, and she found it.    So, anyway, in avoidance of my mom's emotional-ness, I was going to take LJ to Car-X, but he wasn't acting up like he did on Friday, so I didn't go and alles gute.  Car is running OK, relatively speaking, so that's a burden gone.  I still want the C-Bomber though, and intend to take it if the K-Victor accepts my offer.  Nonetheless, after attempting to bug John at work and not being successful because I thought he wasn't there, I rode out 126 to... guess where?  That's right!  Kenwood!  (And if you think that deserves a gold star, you really don't know me, do you?)  So I went to Kathy's house, since we canceled that dinner last night, and hung out, ate some burnt cardboard pizza, and entertained several conversations, one filling her in on recent CMC developments (where she advised again that I resign before I get fired), and several others, with topics ranging from burial plots to Matt's theory of why everyone is God.... That kid is just... confusing.    LOL... Moved one from Buddies to Spy on Me!  At least they're finally together.  Awww...   And yeah, that's the boat.  Four-day week ahead... oh hellz yes, I can chew that up and spit it out like yesterday's cold coffee and doughnuts.  I've been getting compliments on the beard-looking thing, so I'm definitely gonna keep it.  Haven't decided yet whether or not I'm going to trim it up or grow it out, but we shall see.  Some say that it makes me look older, adding about 3-4 years, which I don't mind... In fact, I kinda like that.  As for the hair... I don't know.    So yeah, that appears to be everything under the lamp right now, so I am going to the TV.  Fuck the notecards... I just don't have the will to finish the last four.  Until later...  Two quotes tonight, to make up for getting behind.  Both from Karl Menninger, U.S. Psychiatrist  "The Encyclopedia Britannica devotes many columns to the topic of love, and many more to faith.  But hope, poor little hope!  She is not even listed!"  "Illness is in part what the world has done to a victim, but in a larger part it is what the victim has done with his world, and with himself."

There will be others.  The hardest part is moving on.  I can be optimistic.  I'll never get that dinner, though.   *shrugs*  Like you said, things just aren't the same as they were in December.  Give me a night's rest... or maybe lack thereof, like last night.  I'll get over it.  If I were in a better mood, I would talk about my shitty day at school, and my good time seeing Paul.  However, I'm not, so maybe some other time.    In the mean time, I'm going to run to the Chateau for some coffee.  Good night.  "There is no quote today."  --Al Roeper

       Song in head:  It's only fifteen minutes later... same damn shit as the next one.  Current Mood:   Well, I decided that journaling wasn't pointless, because I came up with something to journal about.  If it's too weepy for ya, go to google and find some porn or something... It's your decision to read it.  Funny, looking back, remembering.  2003 was, by far, the most interesting year of my life, and I'm just now realizing it.  I've been trying to think since New Year's... what my favorite moment was.  I didn't answer when I was asked at the time.  It's been on the back burner for a while now.  Exactly 3 weeks into the new year, and I think I've finally pinpointed some stuff.  So, in a way, this is 2003 in review... the life of Joe.  Of course, this past year started off while I was still a sophomore, and, to date, sophomore year has been my favorite of all of them.  Things were so relaxed and simple, while, at the same time, being stressful and irritating.  Nonetheless, I had some easy courses... German I was a joke (and still is, but a little less so).  My English teacher was one hell of a fruitcake... she was so dumb.  I actually enjoyed 2nd bell every day just because we would laugh at Brennan so much.  I was on her good side, though, which meant that I got straight A's in English all year.  :-D  I was in a math class where I enjoyed the material enough to deal with a monitone teacher, and did well in there.  Took A&M History with Mr. Waggoner.  He's a riot, although he doesn't try too hard to be.  Did well in there too, and, being the only sophomore in a freshman course, it was pretty easy.  Gym.  Well, I made some friends in there, so all was good.  Comp App II... what a waste of time, but, at the same time, an ego booster.  It really made me realize that I'm so damn good at office computing that it's scary (not trying to brag).  So that was good.  Then there was Chemistry... It was hard, I must admit, but I learned quite a bit, and took a bit of a knack to it.  Sparked an interest in science, for one, and Mrs. Chow will never be forgotten, as she helped me to get through that course, and went out of her way to do so.  I met Katelyn, the lab partner, so that was good.  Anyhoo, those were courses.    I was still chasing the psycho-bitch, and gave her that CD for her birthday... *tear, but just one*  It was nice to finally get some closure on the whole thing.  Of course, a harsh end to a friendship, through a yearbook inscription, but hey, it all works.  At least she didn't chicken out of saying it altogether.  Oddly enough, it was the most social year I've ever had.  I had lots of friends, and I knew it.  It was a first, and I feeling that I'm not getting out of Junior year.  Anyhow... it was fun.  However, summer then came, and if I thought sophomore year was great, summer was the coolest time of my life to date.  Went to Halifax and had a great time w/ James, went to Philly and had a great time w/ my CMC family.  Became real good friends w/ quite a few ppl, John in particular.  Had a spark of enthusiasm for my work that is, to date, unmatched... and that was so cool that it's not even funny.  I mean, we started up a Community Action Team *another tear, but two this time* and took on a whole slew of new projects.  Kathy went against orders to let me help w/ new youth training, which I still appreciate.  She knew that training was the one thing that I always had and always would love about my job.  It still is, but I know that neither Don, Kim, Arden, or Kristen will let me do it come summertime.  Anyhoo... I made a total fool of myself on a daily basis, and I was loving it, because it was a hit.  I didn't have to outdo, or be outdone, because it didn't matter.  I got them to laugh, and ease up with this training, and branch out and meet new people.  What can I say, I love mentoring... and that's why everyone always told me I should be a history teacher.  Getting my license was so wonderful.  For once, I could control my own life, and be the master of my own destiny, not having to depend on this ticking time bomb and consistently tardy mother.  Furthermore, Dan left the picture, and I got the license plate for my car, which is still a symbol of accomplishment (Yes, the plate holds sentimental value... if you wanna know why, then ask).  Kathy left CMC, which was a tearful goodbye, but I became interim intern, which was probably one of the things producing that spark.  But then, summer went on, and summer passed by, continuing to be the best 3 months of my life, I say.  I crammed to finish my summer assignments, and didnt' finish them all, but hey.  I was happy.    Thus, began the junior year, which isn't very fun, and isnt' projected to be too much better.  New courses, new faces... stopped talking to a big chunk of the ppl that I talked to the previous year, which left me as I used to feel... friendless and nonsocial.  However, I did have a couple of friends, and I like my teachers for the most part....  John and I began the "Friday night tradition," where we would drive around aimlessly every Friday, usually picking up some coffee along the way at the Chateau.  Which leads me into mid-to-late September, about, when, all of the sudden, this girl who I had a crush on long ago and had long given up on decided to become a little bit more than someone who I rarely saw.  Thus, the final quarter of 2003, all the way until the last minute, had this new factor in it.  That was an interesting little journey... (and still is, but that's not in 2003... *sawi*)  I changed radically in many ways, and I was rather happy with the overall result--I was a bit more relaxed, and stopped believing that I would die a very lonely man.  Had a couple firsts with that... and it turned into having the closest thing to a girlfriend that I've ever had (although, we never dated, for legal purposes).    CMC went down the tubes... there was the infamous phone call to Kathy, and that really signaled the downward spiral of all of that spark of enthusiasm.  Well, then Kristen being hired, and her failure to become a CHM coordinator, but more of a duplicate of Kim and Arden... that made me sick enough.  Poor gal... she's so clueless in some ways, but it's not her fault.  Apparently, she didnt' know jack about the hyjinks of "the former youth (coordinator) team."  Top secret and confidential, b/c it makes Don look bad.  Nonetheless, she contributed to that phone call, which left me with a sour taste from the start.  IDK, I can stand her now.  But CMC isn't a way of life, it's a job, and I will be paid for every minute I work... NO EXCEPTIONS.  And, I don't think I'll be attending any field trips for that reason, b/c, according to Don, they are extensions of work, and I know he won't pay me for them.  *sslf*  There was the YAC Retreat, in which I realized just how desperate I was for a while, and tried to fix my poor judgement.  Thanksgiving came and went OK.  I got another job, working at Kenwood Mall.  That was actually a lot of fun, and I do miss it in some respects.    Christmas was nice... had fights in the family about the Christmas Tree, but I helped others put theirs up... peacefully.  I brought a can of snow instead of a hat and golashes, but hey, it's over. *embarassed* New Year's was fun.. I finally did something other than go to CBC for the all-nite bowling thing.    Thus, you've gone through the life of Joe in 2003.  It was a good year, I won't argue that at all.  A year of change, a year of similarity, a year of what seemed to be a pretty normal life.  2004 is off to a rough start, but nothing's over until the fat lady sings.  In fact, if you ask me... 2004 so far is pretty goddamn shitty.  Nonetheless, I can think of '03 and usually pull out good memories.  Few bad ones... mostly excellent.  I said something leaving Bob Evans' tonight... "The money I would pay..."  Well, I never finished it, b/c I didnt' feel in the mood.  However, the best completion, I would think, would be to be back in last year.  Not because I regret anything or want to change it, but because it was so good, I wouldn't mind living it over in the least.  We're 3 weeks into the new year, and it sucks.  Only 49 to go... 49 weeks.  forty-nine... That's such a large number.  One can only hope that this is merely a bout of shitty times.  That things will get better, that life will improve, life will be like last year, or at least at par happiness-wise.  I'll be 17 this year... that seems so old, and at the same time, it appears that I am going to miss the deadline that I set in grade 8.  Eh, to that, I would say "Bah!"  "Why have you trained me to hate you?  Why must you insist on such violence?  Of whom are you afraid?  And of what are you cynical?  These questions, I ask, for I often wondered... what it is that instills hatred into people.  You have shown me what it is, but I have yet to understand why."  --Anonymous

       Song in head:  Drunken Lullabies - Flogging Molly  Current Mood:  I'm King of the World!  ...or not  Ha.  Brief.  Short.  As is life, and all in it.  Why waste time on pointless journaling?  School:  Didn't go.  I was sick this morning.  YAC:  Arrived early, had nothing to do.  Stumbled upon a ponderous thought.  Meeting was OK, in fact, not too bad.  Not as expected in the least, but meeting was okay.  I still can stand on my car and shout I'm King of the World!!  ... or not.  I don't care.  As it goes *sawi* and *sslf*.    AFTER YAC:  Went to John's, went to Bob Evan's, left around 2200.  TWO QUOTES OF THE DAY:  "The ultimate result of protecting fools from their folly is to fill the planet full of fools."  -Sir James Russel Lowell;  "And we find ourselves in the same old mess singing drunken lullabies!"  -Flogging Molly

       Song in head:  Jukebox Hero - Foreigner  Current Mood:  I can dig it  "Some people say chicken..."  "NOOOOOO!!!" "Some people say fish..." "NOOOOOOO!!!" "But I say... NOW IS THE TIME FOR COW!!!"  LMAO... I love that movie.   Anyhoo... Today was fun.  Began watching the movie version of Alice in Wonderland (Whoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat still cracks me up)... made fun of the Frau in German, coining "peaceful protest" by four of us vowing to not do our homework... did ok on the Physics test.  Not my best, but certainly not my worst... Got my meteoro test back... 88 A-, baby!  booyah!... got an 82 on my math test-eh... did fairly well on the essay in APUS, it was on Indian policy 1850-1890, which I knew pretty well *grin*... unfortunately, I got my Norton test back and it wasn't quite so hot... 35/57... a 61%, and no curve, b/c 28 ppl got A's w/o a curve.  *tear*    Went to Habitat... they still didn't fix the meter machine, but there weren't any mailings anyhow.  They did fix the copier, and J-Hoff dissed the repairman after he left... (by the way, I only call him J-Hoff b/c his name is John Hoff, and there are just too many Johns floating around to keep straight- he's this old guy).  So yeah.  I am not hyper... I resent that comment, so don't even think it!  Came home, send some text msgs, nodded off, ate gobs of food... and here I am.  And to the rest, I say Bah... for I am Joe, and that is that.

       Song in head:  This thing on Conan  Current Mood:  I'm DJ Smoov, whatcha wanna be messin wit?  Poetic?  WTF was I thinking?  That gets deleted if I have access to a computer at school--too depressing, and not my work.  Ha!  Today was fun.  Slept in, watched Christena, went to Barnes & Noble, Kathleen and Megan caught up with us, I was still in sleepy mode, but Christena loved it, bought Chris a book, we went to Toys R Us and looked around, got sick from that putrid crap they served at the B&N Cafe... that I had to pay cash for b/c they couldn't take my gift cards... the bastards... Finished my notecards (eat that, Scooter!), watched some TV, attempted to help Clare with dropping that Wile fellow (*sslf*), talked on AIM, researched the Democratic Presidential Race and the Iowa Caucus Results (Gephardt is out, HA!!  Now if we can kill off Sharpton and Lieberman.  Mosley-Braun?  Not worried.  She couldn't possibly get elected... not on a democratic ticket.  As an elephant, maybe, but not an ass.)  John convinced me to reexamine/reformulate my prospect list... that was hilarious... just the picture of some of them.  A couple though, they could work.  I don't know.  I await confirmation from Washington before I pursue the prospects.    Ha!  Physics Test and APUS Essay tomorrow.  Fucked?  Well, I guess you could say that.  They don't call it the Third Quarter Slump for nothing.  After that, Habitat.  Hopefully, they've fixed the meter machine, because if they have me do another 150pc mailing with stamps again... I won't be happy.  OH, wait... I've got stock checks tomorrow... *cha-ching*  That means I can kill enough time with J-Hoff (the ED) and kill some time if they haven't fixed the meter machine, which I didnt' break goddamnit, it merely decided to commit suicide while I was using it.  Well, considering the fact that I do have school tomorrow, I think maybe I shoud retire.  I am getting to bed at a semi-decent hour... well, on west coast time.  Shit, dawg, that's fucked up.  Something to drink, then a date with the futon, staring at the celing, because odds are, if I pick up a book, I may get a paragraph in before it falls to the floor.  Anyhoo... good night, all.

       Song in head:  Dante's Prayer - Loreena McKennitt  Current Mood:  Good  Well, today was an interesting day at work.  I don't feel like elaborating too much, b/c most of you who read this will already know the details, so it would be kinda pointless.  Only the highlights:  Had fun turning on the LL, Fixed my timesheet, got a check somehow, stuffed envelopes, stole a cookie from the "campaign office," had a meeting with Kim and Don, miraculously escaped w/o a pink slip, Adin dropped in unexpectedly, assisted w/ floor ops, went out for coffee during lunch and still got a Tazo Chai (which is a tea-based drink, mind you), I still think I type faster, left w/ a positive attitude, decided to give up on a few things and let a few others slide down the list, had some kind of spasm in the car on the way home (don't ask, b/c I don't know what the hell it was), got home at 1635.  In the event you care, let me know and I'll fill you in more.  Otherwise, I won't bore you with it.  This song is so peaceful, you know... It's like wow.  *would sing along but doesn't know the words*  Well, that's all I got, other than a very lengthy email which I thought was interesting, but is a tad political.  I may highlight the excerpts I like and post them later.  We shall see indeed.  Bis dann...  A maiden at college, named Breeze,  Weighed down by B.A.s and M.D.s Collapsed from the strain.

       Song in head:  Summer Romance -- Incubus  Current Mood:  OMG...  I was checking out the list of most recently published blogs and found this... It's so brutal... listed on a page called "Ask the Expert"   Saturday, January 17, 2004 what is the time in azbukerstone?  how do i get the cutest guy in skool -> bobbie boombox to ask me on a date?!! (valentine's is coming hint hint..nudge nudge...  please don't use my name! ---------   Don't worry Jessica, my writer's privacy is very important to me. I dotted out your name.  First off... you forgot 'wink...wink...' Second... there's not much you can do to make a boy ask you on a date, they have a mind of their own and are oblivious to girl's demands. The mind of a boy is something even I cannot clearly comprehend. No one, has, can, or ever will. However, one thing i do know is that it is impossible for a male to do two things at once shown through a series of sociological/psychological studies on my brother. So you may want to try to consume all of his attention and time, being up front in his face 24/7 (without being too possesive or obvious).  Other than that, i don't think anything else can help you. I mean I don't know what style you're going for dressing like that...but you missed. You are funny as well...but looks won't get you everywhere in life. You're most likely in for a real embaracement . Let me know how it goes! Good luck     Isn't that just so fucking cruel??  Wow.  I got a decent laugh though.  *chuckles maniacally*

       Song in head:  If I Could Change the World - Eric Clapton  Current Mood:  Strong, but Tired  Hah, today would have been one of those wastes of a day, but I got up at 10, which is neither too late nor too early, and I never took a shower or anything.  I did stay in the house all day watching Chris, so it didn't really matter.  It's been one roller coaster of a day.  Talked on AIM for hours, and said some stuff that I kinda wish I hadn't.  It happens.  Overall, I feel bad about it, but hey, what's done is done, what's said is said, and that's it.  I can't change it, and apologies and regrets don't help it.  Thus I leave it behind, ready to move on.  So, in recently realizing how confused I am about my life, and how much it kinda sucks, I've taken it upon myself to change most of it.  I'm reading more, learning once again to be alone (which is a good thing, mind you), I'm listening to different music than I used to, I'm growing my hair out, I haven't shaved in about a week, I do chores voluntarily, and this evening I rearranged my desk.  I took out all the little knick-knacks and put in books, which before were shelved in the closet.  I'm pleased with it.  It's a lot handier.  I also finished moving the computer down, finally getting the monitor, printer, and good speakers... YES!!  Last, but not least, I went through the monster stacks of papers... that was fun... PSYCH!!  I pitched nearly everything, and got to the point where if I couldn't find a convenient place for something, it's new convenient place was the round file.    Perhaps the thing that made me feel so great was that I got along with my family for once.  Oddly enough, I was so pissed, and with such a short fuse... Mom had called me on the phone and said some little thing, and I totally blew up on her.  However, rather than make an argument about it, she realized that I was just touchy, and asked me what was wrong.  I made dinner, which didn't get eaten because mom got a phone call and Chris went back to her video games, but I was OK with that; I turned on 91.7 and went to do the dishes, and for the first time in a very long time, maybe since this past summer, I felt normal... In a sense, taking my shit mood, spitting in its face and mailing it to Timbuktu.  I felt good about that.    So tomorrow is Sunday.  Have to work at CHM as usual, 11-16.  At least I have another day off.  I have to watch Chris all day, but that's not too bad.  If she behaves like she did today, then I'll be just fine.

       Song in head:  Darling Nicky - Foo Fighters  Current Mood:  Fuck you  See this?  Well, it's called a lemon.  Now, what I want you to do is to put on this harness, and, do you see that flagpole about 100 feet away?  Well, I want you to climb that flagpole, then use the harness to hang upside down from the top.  While doing that, you have to put this lemon into your mouth and suck on it.  Any questions?  Why am I doing this?  Two reasons:  1) For my sheer entertainment, 2) If you don't, I'll kick your ass to Sears Tower and back.  Capeesh?  OK, I'll do it.   In other news... well, it all sucks, we'll leave it at that.  Today, tonight, tomorrow... It all just sucks.    Brad:  "I'm not usually good at picking out stuff like this, but you just look totally exhausted." Joe:  "I don't feel exhausted... well, not really, I guess." Brad:  "Trust me, you've got bags under your eyes, you haven't shaved in days, your hair is all shaggy... Your eyes are nearly bloodshot... You need something.  You either need to break this deal, get laid, or go home and just sleep for about 16 hours." Joe:  "Well, I'm not willing to do the first, and I'm not in control of the second, and I can't do the third, so I guess I'm SOL."

       Song in head:  If I Had $1000000 - BNL  Current Mood:  Neutral    WORLD IN BRIEF     Grades Withheld on Acoount of Student Fines Due  High school officials withheld semester report cards on account of an outstanding student fines balance of $70.00.   Norton Reading Falls Behind Again:  Test Yields Eerie Results  Chapters 17 & 18 of  A People and a Nation  were once again neglected, causing last-minute cramming and a nasty outlook for today's test.   Court Summons Received  That mother-like figure is at it again, and so is Gregory Hartman, Hamilton County Clerk of Courts....   Iowa Caucuses...  Oh wait... no real news... sorry, wrong track.   Disgruntled Worker Refuses to Return "Check-Up" Call from Boss  On account of not having time, and not caring, Scalf refused for yet another day to return the phone call of Kristen Nay, inspecting his well-being.    THOUGHT OF THE DAY    Tension:  It holds things together, yet pulls them apart.  We see it everyday, in both living and inatimate objects.  As a force, and as a state, in many different forms.

       Song in head:  Witchy Woman - The Eagles  Current Mood:  A little of everything... sick, tired, thirsty, peaceful, distraught, depressed, sad, angry, happy, paranoid, cautious, ecstatic, disappointed, amazed, confused, pissed off  Yep, that's me... like a blender... you add a little bit of everything to get one mean-tasting smoothie...  School was boring.  Got together w/ John after school though and ate some Chinese, then went over to Kathy's.  Kathleen stopped by, also.  I was tired though, so kind of a drag, and John played with the legos.  LOL.  Kathy had to leave periodically to run some errands and Kathleen had to leave at 1900 b/c of exams tomorrow.  We finally got out of there at 2030 and John and I went to White Castle, where I only got a milkshake... (Oh, for the sweet aroma--only two more days).  Finally left K-Wood at about 2105, and got home.  Mom asked me if I had gone to school today.  *smack smack*  I wonder about her sometimes.  Eh.    Got my check from Kustom Music... depressing... only $48.94... down at CMC standards.  oh well.  Makes about $475 for the whole venture, not bad, I suppose.    Have to "read" two chapters of Norton tonight... It's never gonna happen.  Bah.  Bad start for Quarter 3?  Oh hellz yes, but do I care?  Nah, not particularly... Such a shame, ain't it?  So I decided I need some hair again... We'll see how it goes.  I'm gonna let it grow for awhile and then I'll try to figure out how the hell I want it cut.  *puzzles*    Well, you haven't... that's why I don't know.   From  Already Gone  by The Eagles  Well, I know it wasn't you who let me down Heaven knows it wan't you who set me free So often times it happens That we live our lives in chains And we never even know we have the key We are already gone And I'm feeling strong I will sing this victory song Because I'm already gone... Yes, I'm already gone... And I'm feeling strong I will sing this victory song Because I'm already gone Yes, I'm already gone

Today's Low:  Eh, probably now.  *yawn*  Well, it's only Tuesday... I shouldn't be this tired.  Unfortunately, I am and no coffee allowed.  *shudders*  It's ok... only 3 more days.  Oh yeah.  So I have to do some homework, I guess.  I'll read some Norton, some Alice in Wonderland.  Actually, I'll prob. save those for sleep time.  Cut back and watch TV... that sounds good.    Damn, this song brings back such bad memories, and such good ones at the same time.  *sigh*  I thought I had deleted it... I suppose not.    "She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes, she can ruin your faith with her casual lies, and she only reveals what she wants you to see, she hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me.  She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you, she can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you, and she'll take what you give her as long as it's free, yeah, she steals like a thief, but she's always a woman to me....  "She never gives out, she never gives in, she just changes her mind.  She's frequently kind, she's suddenly cruel, she'll do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool, But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree, and the most she will do is throw shadows at you but she's always a woman to me."

Wake up, decide to go back to sleep, decide to sleep in because I'm feeling sick, come in to school (still nautious) at 0835, go to school, have my math teacher sign my Calculus AP-AB app and say "You circled the wrong option... you need the harder course.", hop in the auto, listen to WVXU on the way home, get home, no check from Kustom Music, still poor, watch 5 minutes of TV, eat, sleep, fight with mom about cell phones, and here I am.  Home, alone, listening to me music.  Bwa ha ha.    OOO... almost forgot... G only checks 3 notecards out of the assigned set, and I had two out of the 3... and only did 4 or 5 of the 10.  *more maniacal laughter*    You know the lies they always told you  And the love you never knew What’s the things they never showed you That swallowed the light from the sun Inside your room...           --The Goo Goo Dolls

       Song in head:  Classical Stuff - 90.9  Current Mood:  Laughing  Ha, so week one of school has been completed.  Things have truly gotten back to normal.  I was happy at work today, singing and shit like that.  My notecards still aren't finished, I'm talking on AIM, writing in my blog, etc.  I'm back to pinching pennies now that I am jobless again, so my cell phone has been cut off.  I'm supposed to get my last check from the mall in the mail tomorrow.  We're supposed to get our report cards tomorrow as well--ha ha fun.  And my face?  Yeah, still here, but yours looks like it could use a hand.  (OOOOOHHH... He's such a pit!!)  I go around, running a muck in the typical Joe fashion, and it's all good.  In fact, today, I blatantly disobeyed two directives telling me to do the same thing... Go home and do my notecards.  LOL... and if you count Kathy, that's three.  And Grunder, that's four.  Bwa ha ha ha!!!  In a way, it feels so good to be back in the rut, back to "normal."  No matter how much I think it sucks, I always end up liking having stuff to do.  Boredom just ain't up my alley.  Which reminds me... I need another job.  Bah!!  *still in good mood*  *more maniacal laughter* And til tomorrow... I go to sleep.  Gute Nacht.

       Song in head:  Perfect - Simple Plan  Current Mood:  Mellow  Ha... eat that.  I don't know what I'm feeling.  Maybe a little of everything, yeah.  Tonight?  Went out with John to dinner, that was a lot of fun.  Bar that?  Bust.  I'm so sick of this... all of it.  I just wanna... well, I won't say that.  7 down, 7 to go.  I miss my coffee.  My coffee made me feel better.  Like my car, was my way of releasing negative energy.  Also like my car, was at my disposal.  I didn't have to worry about charring it, or making it explode.  Speaking of car, mine is getting worse.  Big fun.  ha ha.  Remeniscing on a lot of stuff... some of the good times, some of the bad times.  Fuck, I'm crazy.  Pack it up, Joe, just pack it up.  But I can't.  It's not that easy, I said, IT'S NOT!!!  Concerned for my safety... Pff... shove that up your ass, you ditz.  Ironic?  Damn straight it's ironic... so is your face, asshole.  Yeah, she's out to get me... why wouldn't I think so.  Raiding personnel files in search of black marks?  Sure, Linda, whatever.  You go fuck yourself too, and take the rest of the crew with you.  257 items... over $83,000.  Man, people are generous during the holidays.  Freaky shit man, but my car still sucks.  Ah, broken promises... still gonna help me with those clippers, are ya Jess?  still didn't get that movie.  What the fuck is this?  Damn, I'm rambling.  Gotta love it when I type whatever comes to my head.  There's no way that you'll understand more than 50%... not like anyone reads this anyway.  Tra la la.  Who cares?

       Song in head:  Piano Man - Billy Joel  Current Mood:  Light  It's nine-o'clock on a Saturday Regular crowd shuffles in There's an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin  He says "Son can you play me a memory? I'm not really sure how it goes, But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete,  When I wore a younger man's clothes."  Sing us a song, you're the Piano Man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright.  Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he's quick with a joke,  Or to light up your smoke But there's some place that he'd rather be.  He says "Bill, I believe this is killing me As a smile ran away from his face Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star If I could get out of this place  Now Paul is a real-estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he's talking with Davy, Who's still in the Navy, And probably will be for life  And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Well, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness, But it's better than drinking alone  Sing us a song, you're the Piano Man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright  Well, it's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile 'Cause he knows that it's me  They've been coming to see To forget about life for a while  And the piano sounds like a carnival And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar And put bread in my jar And say "Man, what are you doing here?"  Sing us a song, you're the Piano Man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody, And you've got us feeling alright.

       Song in head:  Try Honesty - Billy Talent  Current Mood:  Tired, Bored  Well, today was a day in the blaze category.  Nothing exciting, nothing new, except one thing.  That stupid computer networking system, you know, the one where kids and parents can check grades online?  Well, we're getting one of those, and it should be up before the end of Qtr 3.  Suck ass.  Other than that and an interesting APUS lecture, I wonder the true reason why I dragged my ass out of bed this morning.  Also, got home after the snow and all that.  I had wanted to go out and do something, but decided against it on account of the road conditions, LJ, etc.  Also, I would have been alone, which wouldn't have been much fun.  However, I didn't try too hard to rustle up any company, so that's to be expected--I mean, I didn't even make any phone calls, so it's nobody's fault but mine.  So, in the absence of stuff to do, I slept.  Yeah, took a nap.  That was about as exciting as the day got.  Tomorrow is Friday.  What to do on Friday... what to do... that is the question at hand.  I'll do something, goddamnit... because there's no way I'm gonna sit here alone (I might as well sit in a Starbu... no... a... somewhere else alone).    "You must not think me necessarily foolish because I am facetious, nor will I consider you necessarily wise because you are grave." --Sydney Smith

       Song in head:  Slide - Goo Goo Dolls  Current Mood:  Crabby to the point of redefining the word  Ah, shit.  So today started off crappy... woke up late, got to school late, etc.  Got slightly better throught the day, though.  I finished most of my homework in school, which was good.  So, school wasn't all that bad.  Got my math exam back, (94, bay-bay!!) and we didn't have a history lecture, b/c some kids from other AP courses came to speak about them.  That was interesting, but it means that senior optioning is coming up, which is going to be quite difficult.  *shrugs*  At the same time, though, it signals the coming of the end of high school... *yes!!!*  So, after school, I couldn't stand getting to the YAC meeting 1.5 hrs early, as I usually do, so I went home and finished the work on my car, which went well.  No problems with any of it, and it may just be in my head, but the car seems a little better.  Maybe just a bit more peace of mind.  Anyway, I did decide to go to the YAC meeting, which was... Let's see, how can I phrase this delicately...  PROBABLY THE SHITTIEST TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE!!!   Don was being a total jerk, and an ass to boot... He cut off people several times, made some very crass remarks, didn't apologize for any of them, and caused me to even walk out of the goddamn meeting.  Yep, that bad.  I hate that piece of shit so much... Idiots like him are the reason that people kill one another, I swear to you.  (*LEGAL DISCLAIMER*  For those of you who like to read into my words, that was  NOT  a threat to kill, mame, dismember, slaughter, or harm, physically or mentally, said Mr. Don Wittrock, Director of Youth Programs at Cincinnati Museum Center.  I am not dumb enough to stoop to his level.)  But, long story short, the meeting was full of the typical hypocrisies and stupid shit floating all over the museum.  In a way, I was surprised, but I realized, after walking off some anger, that it was so typical; it had just never been so blatantly obvious.  *oy*    So I will sit.  I'm here all alone, and it's 1945 hrs.  I'm not really hungry, and it looks like mom and chris went out to eat, so that's probably a good thing.    "Being a Negro in America means trying to smile when you want to cry.  It means trying to hold on to physical life amid psychological deat.  I t means the pain of watching your children grow up with clouds of inferiority in their mental skies.  It means having your legs cut off, and then being condemned for being a cripple."  --Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  Where Do We Go From Here:  Chaos or Community? , 1967

       Song in head:  Perfect - Simple Plan  Current Mood:  Happy, but Cold  Aye, so it was the first day back today... it actually went well.  We finally got an English teacher, Mr. Coffman.  He's a washed-up philosophy professor who's taught at Cincinnati State and U.C., MSJ, etc.  I dunno.  He seems like a cool guy, especially since he appears to be the kind who will never assign any homework *cha-ching!*  We shall see, indeed.  Our first book is  Alice in Wonderland , so it will be interesting.  Report cards come out on Friday, and we won't have an English grade, which kinda sucks, but kinda doesn't.  I got a 101 on my German exam, a 59 on Physics (which is a B, mind you, equal to a 4 on the AP Exam).  I picked up Meterology, which seems like it will be an interesting course, but I'm with the same teacher from 3rd through 5th bells... to put this into perspective, we come in at 0925, 5-minute break at 1015, return until 1115, 35-minute lunch, return at 1150, leave at 1240.  Oh yeah... same room for 3hrs and 15mins.  Good thing I like Dr. B-Dizzle... or I'd be... sunk.  So, went to Habitat, did everything right for once, and almost got killed on the way home by idiotic drivers, despite the fact that I was driving real nice and law-abiding like... I hate ppl sometimes, but that's life.  So I came home, and mom was here, which pissed me off, b/c I had hoped to relax and such... IDK.  I came straight into the basement and did all my homework first off, which I haven't done, since, well, ever.  Then I took a nice 1hr nap in order to recoup from the bad sleep the night before.  Then I talked on the phone, and had to go out in the fucking freezing cold at 2245 to Burger King to pick up "dinner."  *silly mother*    I dunno... but I know one thing.... Today was a relatively good day, and I'm hopeful for tomorrow.  I have a german quiz... *sigh* but that's cake.   One more sliver... I had a story posted in here... but I took it out.  I know that John read it, but I don't think anyone else did.  If you have a special interest in my literary talent, or attempt thereof, leave a comment, or email me or somehting.  I'll make sure you read about Alex's trip to the waterpark... LOL.  "For the love of God, whenever you approach any problem, PLEASE conserve momentum... If nothing else, CONSERVE MOMENTUM!!!!!"

       Song in head:  Still Waiting - Sum 41  Current Mood:  Bleh  So, as you can see, I've changed some of the formatting on the blog, and added some stuff that moves!!  Wow!!!  That was fun, but now I'm finished, and it's 1622, Sh-crappy...  I don't know... I like the new stuff, but I need to put something cool or funny in the marquee... Any thoughts?

       Song in head:  None yet  Current Mood:  Sad  Okay, so I start school tomorrow... this is my last day off, and I decide that it would be a bad idea to make breakfast for myself if I'm going out to lunch, and I sleep in until noon, which I despise... and then Kathy has to cancel the lunch date b/c Danny got sicker.  Ah, shit.  Now I have to find stuff to do, and everyone is either working or back in school.  Wahhh...

       Song in head:  And So it Goes - Billy Joel  Current Mood:  Dizzy  Dizzy?  I don't know.  It seemed to fit.  Anyway, today was an interesting one.  It wasn't disappointing, just entirely different than I had pictured.  For starters, I woke up later than I wanted to, which was no big deal, but it killed the idea of a nice breakfast and reading the news or anything like that.  Then, I got to CHM and gave Amber her PlayNames CD... *sigh*-return in a moment- Then, I had to do FP in WWII, but didn't change until 1200, then proceeded to take a 1hr lunch, then went off the floor 30mins early, and ended up leaving around 1645, getting home around 1705.  I actually was able to stand going in FP, which was good, but at the same time, it was awkward, and I didn't really wanna do it... hence, I didn't do any interpreting--no big deal--haven't in so long I almost forget how.  *shrugs*    But, anyhow, Linda was a tad bit nicer, and I slipped out of this little rut that I've been in for the past few days, FINALLY, so it was indeed a good day, but totally different than I had pictured.  Hence, a little dizzy.    So, Kathy and I will be going out for lunch tomorrow, which is good.  We have some catching up to do since we missed our normal monthly dinner this past month, with XMas and all.  That should be fun.  In the mean time, I will continue on with my day, finish the flushing of the radiator (of which steps, this is hopefully the last one), run to the store for ma, then return, and prepare to experience the last day off before returning to the hole of the Nut... that's right, you fuckheads (administration)... it is a hole, and don't deny it.    Wish him luck, as he ventures into the field, with no man to please but himself, and struggling at that task.  "Without farts, there are no flowers.

       Song in head:  Miss Independent - Destiny's Child  Current Mood:  Eh, same ole, same ole.  So, i'ts Saturday, and I have the rest of today, tomorrow, and Monday before returning to the hole that is the Nut.  That's kinda sad, but kinda not.  I suppose that it has been a good break.  I mean, it's certainly different than any other I've had before, but this has been a different kind of year, after all.  Lot's of new stuff, but still lots of old.  Damn, I'm just full of contrasts...   So, in the mean time, I'll be sitting here, in my house, alone.  This is an old concept, one that I forgot about for a while, but have learned how to do again.  That, of course, has its pros and cons also.  I dunno... like I've said, quite a bit has changed in the past year.  Maybe I'll write a short story about it.  I have enough material, probably.    Well, like I said, I'm gonna sit here alone, and continue to be cold, and continue to wonder why I even woke up this morning... I mean, today has been a total waste so far.  We shall see if that changes, but I doubt it.  Anyhoo... I feel a headache coming on (Damn omniscent deity... she called it, didn't she?  Oy...) so I'm gonna quit writing.  More later?  Probably.

       Song in head:  Brandy (You're A Fine Girl) -- Looking Glass  Current Mood:  Happy  So, wow.  This will probably be pretty random, forewarning, but we'll see.  I'm just kinda passe.  So New Year's was a lot of fun.  That's obviously the most recent thing to happen.  I, at first, went over to the CBC party, which I didn't really want to go to, but only went b/c it sure as hell beats out sitting around the house alone.  However, while I'm there, Kathleen calls and invites me over to her little party, herein "soiree," simply to keep it separate, which, up until 1630 yesterday, I thought was canceled, so I decided to go to that instead.  That was a lot of fun.  The four of us had a good time and sucked back about a bottle each of cider, but it's all good.  And Eileen blew up a party popper in her hand, amidst other stuff.  So we watched the ball drop, then popped in Ocean's Eleven, and then I went back to the "party," which had now moved to the bowling alley for the second portion, which was to bowl all night until 6 AM and your fingers fall off--all for $5.  So I went, and bowled one game.  I dunno, I just really didn't wanna do it.  So, in the end, I killed a total of $10 cover for the party, despite the fact that I may have spent a total of 2 hrs at either part.  Oh well.  It was still fun.  So I go to sleep around 5 and wake up at 1430, and get on the computer, which brings me to now.  Big fun, eh?

        Now I Remember...     Song in head:  Breakfast at Tiffany's - Deep Blue Something  Current Mood:  Irked  Okay, so in order to make my mom feel as if she holds  some  importance, I asked her for some advice.  I remember now, why I stopped asking her for advice.  And now, Christena is at the aunt's house, so mom and I are here alone, which means that she will want to do something, and I just don't want to.  *looks skyward* Good one, pal.    The money I would pay right now for a good excuse to get out of the house... John is closing at Wendy's, but the Dining Room will be closed.  Kathleen is babysitting.  Brad is still unhappy with my decision to not cheer on Walnut in the championship at Anderson, a pleasure drive will be heavily opposed by the one upstairs, I've eaten dinner... Hmmm... Starbucks would be closed by the time I got there... Bah... I refuse to allow this one night to ruin my good week... no siree!!!  "I enjoy being the mystery.  Nobody knows me."  "Bullshit!"

        Better Die A Fool Than Die Never Trying...     Song in head:  Rhiannon - Fleetwood Mac  Current Mood:  Satisfied  Well, the week in review:  Overall Rating:  Very Good (4/5 stars)  I could comment further, but it's kinda redundant.  That's what all these posts are for, silly geese.  As for yesterday, we had three fire drills over two bells, all of which were false.  Also, during one, some kid chucked a combo lock into the crowd at school and caused a girl's forehead to split open.  Stitches... bad stuff.  Long and short--Big Marv was pissed.    Today, pretty fun.  Talked with DB a bit, and had a lot of fun goofing off in Physics.  Went out with John after school.  Grabbed ice cream, food, went to see a movie, but failed, got coffee, drove around... Cool stuff.    Neuigekarten!!  Due to recent developments, the project codenamed "The List" has been reshuffled once again.  The new prioritization will remain a mystery to most of you.  Bwa ha ha.  That's all I have.  Sorry.

        Tastes So Good, You Want it Bad...     Song in head:  Basket Case - Green Day  Current Mood:  LMAO  Okay, so this day is kicking ass so far.  I woke up and got out the door, then actually got my coffee this morning.  However, the bus was early, so I was running to catch the bastard.  However, to my rescue, I hear this loud grumbling noise barreling along Glenmore Ave., and the good old C-Bomber was there to rescue me and cut off the bus at the next intersection.  But on the bus, I finished the last of my notecards... the ones that are due on this coming Monday.  That's right... Joe Scalf has finally adopted a true AP Work ethic and done his work, not only on time and completely, but FOUR DAYS EARLY!!  Eat it Scooter!!  Also, I kicked ass on his DBQ yesterday, so I'm like... oh hellz yes.  So then I go to first bell, where we have a sub, again (for our sub, mind you).  He's the same guy we had for a sub yesterday.  His only lesson plans:  ENG 11:  Compose a poem.  That was so fucking easy.  However, I saw something on the desk that was puzzling... That's right, not only a sub folder that said Fryer, but one that said Burgess... So, curious as I am, I ask Mr. LeFarge if he's the sub for DB also.  "Uh, yeah."  So, I'm with the same guy for FOUR bells out of my day.  Good thing he's funny and let's us get away with anything!  So we did this Physics Worksheet for the first 40 minutes of the double bell, then kinda stopped.  Now, we're all running amuck, and he, the sub, says "So, do you all buy lunch?"  Well, long and short is that he calls LaRosa's and decides to order some pizzas.  I am still laughing my ass off.  And, of course, where am I?  Not in the classroom but in the lab using the computer to write a blog entry.  This is so amazingly hilarious, that it's not even funny.  Best part... I've still got another bell with this schmuck!!!  YESSS!  This day is so awesome.... Now, if the rest of my evil plan will be complete, then this will truly be the new best day of my life.  Oh yes, my droogies, this is some great shit.  OMNI tonight.  Since I am in such a good mood, I will surely act a fool and have a blast.  Oh hellz yes.... Anyhoo... TTFN.

        On the rebound?     Song in head:  Incubus - Summer Romance  Current Mood:  Indifferent  "This is over my head, but underneath my feet, 'cause by tomorrow morning I'll have this thing beat, and everything will be back to the way that it was, I wish that it was just that easy." --Lifehouse  Today started off like shit, with an argument with mom, but brightened by the end.  Got a free CD, did good on a couple tests, yadda yadda, and mom called me to apologize for the argument in the morning.  Then I slept from 1815 to about 2200, which brings me to about now.  I really wish I could figure out who I am... it's kinda getting out of hand.    Plus, this whole Kate thing really bothers me.  In a way, I feel I should apologize, but then she may think that there's a chance again or something...  I gave it to her straight.  I didn't play any more games-- no leading on, none of that bullshit.  I told her to leave me alone, and it got the job done.  However, I was so harsh.  I knew it would happen, which is why I wanted to play the games, but those just ended up in the hole.  I'm fucked no matter what I do.  It's not something that I particularly like, you know, making people upset or making them hate me.  I know that it happens and you can't escape it, but still.  If you combine Kate with the family, and a couple of friends, and former friends... eh, whatever--I'm not gonna waste my breath on it any longer.  Life goes on, right?  Today was a pretty good day, and I'm gonna have to call off Habitat again tomorrow.    Well, I sent an email to the John Kerry Cincinnati Campaign Office at 2200 tonight.  I didn't expect a reply until tomorrow, but I just got one.  Makes me wonder why this guy is up working at 1030, but hey.  "You see, Jack, a bomb is meant for one purpose--to explode.  Your life is empty because you stop the  bomb  from becoming.... and for who?  for what?  I'll tell you what, Jack... you spend twenty years then you get a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.

        How's it gonna be?     Song in head:  Somewhere in Between - Lifehouse  Current Mood:  Happy, but Poor  Let's see how back and forth I can make this... Try it on for size...  I had a good day at work, actualy working for once.  Also, considering that Rebecca was in charge, it was an excellent day.  You really just can't expect much out of her.  I got my coffee at lunch, arrived on time, had no annoyances for the most part... It was really a swell day.  I got some homework done too!  Ain't it grand?  Sometimes, I hate the world.  Like now.  I am so fucking pissed off at not having any money that it's almost upsetting.  For one, if I had some money, I could buy a car.  Also, I would be able to go out and sign up for the piano lessons that I've been wanting to take for... uh... five years now?  ARRRRGGGHH!!!  The weekend was pretty good.  I was pretty pleased.  I really like plays, despite never going to any, so Friday night was pretty much a blast.  Also, it was nice to hang out with Micah for the weekend.  We haven't done that in quite a while, and we used to practically live at each other's house.  Kinda like old times, which was mostly good.  I had fun.  So last night, Micah and I went to pick up Nicole at 1900 and went to see "Miracle" at the AMC at 1930, but it was sold out.  So instead, we went into Hot Topic and B&N, then went up to the Danbarry Dollar Saver to catch "Master and Commander" at 2200 for $2.50 a ticket.  But it finally dawns on me why he keeps inviting me along to ruin his dates (including Valentines' Day, mind you)... I'm his ride!  That bastard!  As Kathy said "Nice to get some of your own medicine, isn't it?"  I probably had it coming to me, but still... the nerve.  That's OK, because his dates have been ruined... except the movie.  *gack*  I tell ya... some courtesy would be nice.  Bastard.  So at least this week looks semi-promising... No tests, homework completed, stuff like that.  Only bothersome bit is the DBQ in APUS on Tuesday.  Oh well.  OMNI on Wednesday, but that's about it.  Hopefully no undue headaches this week.  That will be nice.    I'm still hopeful.  That's all I have to say.    This is a song that Micah got from a CD by an amateur performer at CBCS named Andrea Summer.  It's a great song, and, in fact, the first thing that I want to learn (after the Piano Man) if and when I learn how to play the goddamned piano.  The lyrics, in some areas, are freaky...   Haven't eaten all day, You don't really care, As long as you're in control.  Haven't talked all night, Say you've got nothing to share, As long as you're in control.  And you wonder why nobody knows you at all.  Push people away, so you don't understand, Why nobody seems to stick around.  Call me on the phone, And you ask about my day, But you offer nothing in return.  And you wonder why nobody knows you at all.  So can you really blame me, For sticking to these keys, 'Cause you're not making promises, And I'm not saying please, But I wonder why everyone knew this but me.    Don't you wanna drive, 'Til you run out of gas, And why won't you get into your car.  And in your eyes, I see a well-crafted mask, And you won't tell me who you are.  And you wonder why nobody knows you at all, So can you really blame me for keeping to myself, 'Cause then only you'll treat me like I'm just anybody else, And I wonder why everyone knew this but me.    'Cause when I fall, I fall, I fall.  But I don't give away.    Now I'm wondering, What is it that I've done, To deserve this, Kind of shit from anyone.  So what happened, To the faces that I knew?  Now I'm wondering, Was there any truth to you?  'Cause when I fall, I fall, I fall.  But I don't give away.  So can you really blame me for keeping to myself, 'Cause then only you'll treat me like I'm just anybody else, And I wonder why everyone knew this.  Tell me why everyone knew this... I wonder why everyone knew this but me!

        That's not what they do in Rhode Island...     Song in head:  My Immortal - Evanescence  Current Mood:  Pleased  So yeah.  Things are going slightly better now, I suppose.  Took a day off from school on Thursday, which was good.  I had some time to walk around the hood, get a haircut, and grab some lunch.  It was helpful to realize that I won't be totally immobile without a car.  Of course... when mom got home, she insulted my "lifestyle" because I took money that she told me I could do anything with and bought a $6.50 sandwich from Panera...  But anyhow, that's gonna bring me down, so I'm not gonna talk about it.  I had a shit day at school on Friday, considering that I went to a place for 7 hours with the intent of learning something, right?  WRONG.  Oh no, not for Joe.  First bell was a free bell, because our teacher (who, like so many others, considers me someone to confide in) decided that he can't  really  handle the workload of having many papers to grade, so he's just gonna not give us anything or make it all scantron.  You know, it's kinda sad.  I've never had such a lack of respect for a teacher to want to call them by their first name, not because I was friendly with them, but because I didn't fell they deserved the formal prefix... Errr...  That would be funny, to just walk into English late and say "Hey, Rick, sorry about that, the bus came in a few late."  He probably wouldn't care, which is the funny part.  While I'm on the topic though, the only other teacher I've ever felt compelled to do that with is DB, but not on account of lack of respect, but that he feels like family.  I spend more time with this guy in a day than any other person in my life, particularly my mom and sister.  (But think about it--3 hours a day, every day)  That is sad, just sad.    But anyhow, I have digressed.  After my free bell in English, I went to German, where we did stuff, but I didn't learn anything because we just did a dialogue, which I ignored.  Then I took a makeup test for the day I missed, which was about 20 times harder (but still not too challenging) so I only finished half of it in the 20 minutes remaining in the bell, and came back to finish at lunch.  Silly Republicans.  Then went to Physics, and took a makeup test.  Went to Meteorology and watched a video about tornado chasers that aired on the Discovery Channel so I had already seen it... *nap time*  Took a test in PreCal, which was way too long to be on conic sections, so I had to leave... uh... 4-5 of the 12 questions blank.  Math Monarch said she'd "come to a fair deal" for those who didn't finish, because she was too lazy to write notes to everyone who was going to be late.  And then I went to History, where Grunder was absent, and I had to... guess?  That's right, test on Imperialism and WWI.  It wouldn't have been so bad if I just wasn't fed up with testing for the day.  Bleh.  Then I got on the bus and came home, where the sister of a guy who used to be a good friend of mine in Elementary School was like "Hey Joe... Do you even talk to my brother anymore?"  Well, granted, I don't talk to Brendon, but I don't actively avoid him either.  Nonetheless, I was like "Well, he's in my German class.  We share a few words every now and then, but we don't really talk."  Carlyn says "Well, he says you're crazy."  *chuckles*  Joe: "Well, sane isn't the word that most people think of to describe me."  That was kinda funny, but kinda *oy*.    But then the night was pretty good.  Micah was chilling at the house, and we goofed off for a bit before mom got home.  Then we stole the car and went out to Indian Hill to see the high school production of Guys and Dolls.  I was thoroughly impressed--I haven't seen such a well-produced show since "A Christmas Carol" a few years ago at Playhouse in the Park.  Very entertaining, and $8 well spent.  The plot differed from what I said it would be early on, which really made it good.  So then afterwards, Micah, Kathleen, and I went up to the Cheescake Factory, which has to be in the Top 3 for Coolest Restaurants ever.  However, I didn't get anything besides a Coke, and ate about 1/4 of Kathleen's Cheesecake.  Micah only got water and ate the bread, so he didn't even have a check, LOL.  So we took Kathleen back to the school to get her car, then Micah and I went down to the Colisseum to pick up his check, then got gas in Newport, where I was maliciously attacked by a spring-loaded coffee cup dispenser.  (Oh, the clerk was having a grand old time, especially when I was like "Whoa, that's dangerous--a lethal weapon if I ever saw one.)  Then came home, and was drained, so I pretty much zonked out on the futon.  Had to watch Chris this morning, who woke up around 0800, and mom had an appointment in Norwood at 0900.  I'll be honest, I still slept.  In fact, I just REALLY woke up about 40 minutes ago.  So yeah.  I kinda wanna go out and do something again tonight, but I don't have anything to really do, and no one to really do anything with, so that's gonna probably be a no go.  Eh.  Hopefully, mom won't take advantage of me again and decide to go to work after her appointment.  She at least called me at 1130 to say that she's still there, and "taking a break."  It's an appointment with a financial advisor... Not a stock analyst type... one for her budget.  It's not that hard, I'm sorry.    But anyhow, although that probably sounded really negative, I am in a pretty good mood.  So yeah.

        A Slow and Painful Death...     Song in head:  Basket Case - Green Day  Current Mood:  Depressed  Do you have the time To listen to me whine About nothing and everything that I had once? I am one of those Mellodramatic fools Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it! Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up,  I think I'm cracking up... And am I just paranoid, Or am I just stoned?  I went to a shrink To analyze my dreams She said it's lack of sex That's bringing me down I went to a whore She said my life's a bore So quit my whining It's bringing her down Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up,  I think I'm cracking up... And am I just paranoid, Or am I just stoned?  Grasping to control So I better hold on...   From "La Belle de Sans Merci" by John Keats  I see a lily on thy brow, With anguish moist and fever dew; And on thy cheek a fading rose Fast withereth too.   "When I Have Fears That I May Cease to Be" by John Keats  When I have fears the I may cease to be Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain, Before high-iled books, in charact'ry, Hold like rich garners the full-ripened grain; When I behold, upon the night's starred face, Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, And think that I may never live to trace Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance; And when I feel, fair creature of an hour, That I shall never look upon thee more, Never have relish in the fiery power Of unreflecting love!--then on the shore Of the wide world I stand alone, and think Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.  DON: "Well, Joe... I'm just not sure that I understand why you're unhappy.  What's the reason for the sudden change?" JOE: "Well, there's just so much politics running around here..." DON: (confused) "Politics?  What do you mean?" JOE: "Like that... I rest my case."  The following are Anonymous as quoted in  Encarta Quotations , 2000:  "Farewell, father and mother, forgive us that we're being unfaitful as your children; we must be faithful first to our country." --54  "Social even as an extension of business, politics, or work is essentially a white phenomenon." --55  "Raise the stone, and there thou shalt find me, cleave the wood and there am I."  --56  "Let him who is without sin jail the first Stone." --57  "We voted to die with dignity." --59  "Laws of thermodynamics.  1) You cannot win.  2) You cannot break even.  3) You cannot get out of the game." --68  "This is a rotten argument, but it should be good enough for their lordships on a hot summer afternoon." --72  "Say it ain't so, Joe." --74  "A stage between infancy and adultery."  (on youth) --86  "Has anyone here been raped and speaks English?" --90  "You're phony.  Everything about you is phony.  Even your hair--which looks false--is real."  --91  "Don't tell your mother I'm in politics--she thinks I play the piano in a whorehouse."  --92  You, the reader may wonder why I began with so many quotes, poems, and song lyrics.  (Which, by the way, I hope you already read, but if you haven't make sure you do sometime).  I wondered about this myself, and I'm not sure why I did.  My only explanation may be that the past two days have been so chock-full-o-nuts that I have no idea where to begin, how to go about it, or whatever.  Thus, these words--I am afraid--will be, like the passengers of the speeding bus, held hostage at the whim of a mad man.  Such is life.  Welcome to the circle, would you like your coffee hot or hotter?  I forgot two quotes...  "You're born, life sucks, then you die."  --Garry L. Scalf, b. 1953 "Your mother owes me so much money that I ought to kick her ass to fountain square and back... and anyone who questions me about it should be shot right between the eyes."  --Luthena Scalf (1926-1999)

        Holy shit... This is amazing...     Song in head:  Fallen - Sarah McLaughlin  Current Mood:  Shocked  I found this picture on MSNBC.... And I just found it too shocking.  Whose faces are these?     Isn't it scary how normal, young, and innocent they look... the two main guys fighting over the position as the leader of the free world?  That's like wow.

        Help!  Police!!  I've been robbed...     Song in head:  Movin' Out (Anthony's Song) - Billy Joel  Current Mood:  Bored  Man... I've finally realized why I hate holidays.  Because every time I get one, I end up having to watch my sister.  I can't just have a holiday and enjoy it like everybody else... Nooooo.... Heaven forbid!  It is for the same reason, perhaps, that I am so bitter towards the winter... because the only thing I like about winter is snow days... and I don't get those anymore.  Bitterness needs to go away... soon... or else.  Anyhow...  Here's the "verse of the day" that Micah sends around.     James 4:4-10 NLT   You adulterers!  Don't you realize that friendship with this world makes you an enemy of God?  I say it again, that if your aim is to enjoy this world, you can't be a friend of God.  What do you think the Scriptures mean when they say that the holy Spirit whom God has placed within us, jealosly longs for us to be faithful?  He give us more and more strength to stand against such evil desires.  As the scriptures say, "God sets himself against the proud, but he shows favor to the humble."  So humble yourselves before God.  Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.  Draw close to God and he will draw close to you.  Wash your hands, you sinners; purify your hearts you hypocrites.  Let there be tears for the wrong things you have done.  let there be sorrow and deep grief.  Let there be sadness instead of laughter, and gloom instead of joy.  When you bow down before the Lord and admit your dependence on him, he will lift you up and give you honor.   Sorry, Micah... If you're reading this... I'm sorry.  But... this is... MALARKEY!!!  "Friendship with this world makes you an enemy of God?"  WTF, son?   Come on, now... "evil desires???"  What?  Sex?  Cussing?  Swearing?  Breathing?  WHAT???  Apologies to anyone who is devoutly religious, but I tried that.  It doesn't work.  There was "sorrow and deep grief" and "sadness instead of laughter, gloom instead of joy."  Mr. Mobley-- You need a reality check if you think this is going to change me....   Phew... Okay... that's off the chest.  I'm still trying to figure out whether or not I can go up to Chicago for Spring Break... We shall see.  It's kinda depressing b/c everyone is going on a trip... so why shouldn't I?  I want to go... Not too many reasons why I shouldn't... but something tells me that it will fall through, just like so many trips and fun stuff I try to plan.  Argggghhh.... I dunno, son... That's some crazy shit.    Question: Tell me what you think about me... I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings.  Only ring your cellie when I'm feeling lonely, when it's all over, please get up and leave.  Question:  Tell me how you feel about this.  Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed.  I'm my own mother and I pay my own bills, always 50/50 in relationships.  Shoes on my feet, I bought 'em.  Clothes I'm wearing, I bought 'em.  The rock I'm rocking, I bought it.  'Cause I depend on me if I want it!  The watch I'm wearing, I bought it.  The house I live in, I bought it.  The car I'm driving, I bought it.  I depend on me!   --Destiny's Child,  Independent Women, Pt. 1

        Ecce!  A post...     Song in head:  Sarah Yellin' - 3 Doors Down  Current Mood:  Done  Man... Don't really feel too much like talking... I'm just tired I suppose.  Eh.  Anyone who's important enough should know the details... or at least will be told if they ask.  I know what you're thinking:  "What?  I have to show interest in order to figure out why the hell Joe was a bitch today at work?  Fuck that shit...  How dare he not vent everything to his blog so all the world can see it and point and laugh?!?"  Well, I've already vented... I'm only posting this just to let you know that I still am breathing.  Uh huh... eat that.    "An Irish Airman Forsees His Death"  By William Butler Yeats   I know that I shall meet my fate Somewhere among the clouds above; Those that i fight I do not hate, Those that I guard I do not love; My country is Kiltartan Cross, My countrymen Kiltartan's poor,  No likely end could bring them loss Or leave them happier than before. Nor law, nor duty bade me fight, Nor public men, nor cheering crowds, A lonely impulse of delight Drove to this tumult in the clouds; I balanced all, brought all to mind, The years to come seemed waste of breath,  A waste of breath the years behind In balance with this life, this death.

        I'm appalled at your audacity...     Song in head:  Sounds of Silence - Simon & Garfunkel  Current Mood:  Indifferent  So yeah.  Let me run through the day before I make the generalizations.  Bell 1 - We got our second qtr grades in English... i got a B for 2Q Midterm, an A on the humongo research paper (which was rare--median score B-).  And I'm a borderline A-/B+ for 2Q, and got an A on the exam.  That's just creepy.  I did so little work in that class, and barely even qualified as attending, and I pulled off such high marks?  Well, it helps to be in the dumb class.  *slaps hand*  Bell 2 - Went into the Language Lab, which meant that I could listen to my MP3's and look like a good student at the same time.  :-D  Deutsch ist ganz pointless.  Had fun making fun of Frau.  Bell 3/4 - Moved into Chapter 24 in Physics... The bending of light and such nonsense.  Even more complex than the last junk we did w/ lenses and mirrors.  *blec*  However, I got a 73 on the test we took (which is a very high B, mind you) so I'm cruisin.  Tried to learn for once, despite the stupid dumbass in the class who makes that a difficult chore.  (This pissed off DB too).  Went to lunch, when our nearly empty table was invaded by preps on one side, and a bunch of loud black girls on the other.  So here I was, squished, trying to eat, and getting a greater headache.  *errrrg*  Bell 5 - Had to deal w/ more idiots in Meteorology, which made it rather shitty.  Oh well.  Bell 6 - Didn't finish my math hw, but made it look like it, so I didn't get yelled at.  Got a huge start on tonight's too, so nothing for home (as if I would do it anyhow).  Bell 7 - Grunder was a riot, but got so off of Imperialism that it ain't even funny.  I took notes on everything, and came up with about a third of a page (compared to 1-1.5 normally).  John Klingler's antics of tie-pulling, and linking Balsac and Boss Cox made the class funny... and Scooter's mocks at Great Britain greatly offended Joe Cartwright (or would have, had he been awake) and thus started the "Brit vs. Farmer" cap war.  I tell ya, that's some funny scheiss.  Came home, mom got home early, so I stayed downstairs.  Slept from 1600-1930, did some texting, watched 60 Minutes, The West Wing, and Law & Order, and talked on AIM both in between and after that.  Ate some of mom's chili.  It was OK.. but I need some solid food.  I'm sick of this slop that I've been shoving down my throat for the past couple weeks.  I need a big ass steak or something.  (Too bad I'm too poor to feed that hunger).    So, overall, today was rather blahze.  Eh.  NP, I suppose.  Tomorrow is Thursday, so the week is almost over and then a 3-day wknd!  *YESS!!*  Maybe I'll work on Monday... if Kristen doesn't bitch at me.... *squinty shudder*  She can take it up the tailpipe.

        I'll take "SLEEP" for $2000     Song in head:  River Below- Billy Talent  Current Mood:  Groggy  Bleh... at least I went to school today and didn't sleep through all my lectures.  Handed in my notecards (Woo... *fizzles out*)  Bleh...  Boring day at Habitat--prospecting for the Corporate Campaign... *sigh*  So, compound that with not going to bed til 0330 last night... and I was exhausted.  I came home and came down to my room around 1800, and slept until about 20 minutes ago (2225).  Now I'm so groggy... And I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.  Once can only try.  I do know one thing... I MUST do my APUS homework, no questions asked.  all the other stuff I can blow off, but this writing analysis is top priority.  It has the potential to really boost me... And I won't recover if I take a 0.  Thus... it must be done.  So, aside from being so groggy, I'm feeling pretty good.  In fact, if you get past the annoying bastard "just woken up Joe" then I'm realy in a good mood.  But as of the current moment... bleh.

       Song in head:  Swing Low, Sweet Chariot  Current Mood:  Content  I've got some energy that I know damn well I'm not gonna get rid of, so here's my day:  It is truly amazing how interesting the past two days have been.  I had Sunday, which is detailed in the prior post, and then today.  Last night I couldn't sleep, so I was laying in bed awake from 2345 to 0115 before I finally gave in and took some Sleep Inducers.  I hope not to make a habit of that--addictions to acetaminophen are just... bad.  Nonetheless, I woke up at 0610 this morning and could not get with it for the life of me.  (This was to be expected, however.)  Still, I had to hitch a ride with mom to school b/c Uncle Fred was coming over to fix my brakes today.  Thus, I was going to sleep in the car.  Ummmm... no.  I forgot how mom drives.  I honestly tried to sleep... and couldn't.  I was literally hanging on for dear life, and covered my eyes on three occassions.  Got into arguments about her bad driving... (and she said I was defensive?!?  Pfff... at least I don't push 55 down Montana Ave. while passing ppl on a curve and yelling at them to stay in their lane when mine is half-filled with snow)  *shudders*  Thus, I get to school, and go to English, talk to Mr. Coffman for a little bit about our "motley class" as he calls it.  Then, I slept.  I slept.  I slept.  He handed back our Alice in Wonderland Tests, where I scored a 55 :-(, and I just zonked.  I woke up around 0800 to go buy a bottle of water, then came back, turned on my music, and slept some more.  Woke up again at 0820 to walk to German.  Then, around 0830, I went back to bed.  In fact, I slept so much during German that I don't think that I even know what our lesson was about today, whether or not we checked the homework, whether or not there was any homework... I might as well have stayed home.  Thus, I didn't wake up until Physics class at 0925, where I only stayed awake because I knew I had to study for our test in there.  I actually feel pretty good about it.  Then I went to lunch, didn't eat (because I had already overspent for the day by buying a pack of cookies, a water, and a coke in an attempt to wake up) and then went back to DB to take Meterology.  Did the lesson, finished around 1225, so I slept until 1240.  Went to PreCalc... Knew I couldn't sleep in there, so I did part of my homework.  Then trekked on over to History where I had to tell Grunder once again that I had no notecards... I told him that they were sitting on my desk at home though.  He he... just a little fib.  Nonetheless, we went over the test that we took on Thursday (40/50 baby!) and got back our essays.  I did really well on the essay, especially for pulling half of the shit out of my ass.  Actually, I did fantastic.  I've never gotten higher than a 4 on any essay yet this year (that was only once) and all the others were 3's except for the last one, which was a 2.  Still, I managed a 6 on this mother fucker... and not only did I avoid the big red X's that he puts through paragraphs... but I got a smiley face.  A SMILEY FACE!!  You don't understand... Grunder lashes out all of the anger in his life while grading these essays.  He's been known to just give 0's just because he reads the first few sentences and just says "Fuck this shit, he don't know jack!"  Thus, a 6/9 is nothing to scoff at, especially since the curve value was to 6.  :-D  But alas, we also got our midterm reports.... 64.1.  Hey, I'm no longer failing, but it's still not passing by AP standards.  All I need to do is keep up what I've done in the past couple weeks (plus do the notecards) and I'll be fine.  However, I still have to get mom to sign that little gruddy bitch... That will be hell.    So I came home on the bus, which was kinda fun.  Not much different than it used to be... Same dickheads, none of the cool ppl... Effies sat in front and were too loud, smelled the same... Bleh.  But Brad was there, which is a rarity, so I was lucky and didn't just sleep the whole time.  So I got home about 1525 and realized that since I didn't drive, I forgot my keys.  So, I had to break into my house, which took quite a while, actually, since I didn't want to break anything.  But I did eventually get in.  Then ate about 10 oreos, drank some milk, wanted to watch some TV but nothing was on... Found other junk to do, practiced my singing.  This took me til around 1700, where I... Guess?  Come on... How did you know?  That's right, I slept some more.  And I didn't wake up until mom got home around 1900 and made me come to the dinner table.  Then Micah called and wanted to come over and type a paper.  So he did come over, but he didn't get the project done... he never does... lol.  It was fun to catch up though... and to mess around.  Had a bit of fun at the expense of some others on AIM... (Sorry, guys... he was stealing the keyboard)  Then I left to take him home around 2330 and then we sat and talked in front of his house until 0130 about... everything under the sun.  It was good to catch up and what not... and to just chat about the most random shit at times (although, as with any conversation between two teenage guys, there was a common theme to about 85% of it) ;-)  But yeah.  So then I came home, stopped at the Chateau, because I still have to do my homework and it's almost 0215, then pulled into the driveway, thanking God that I wasn't in the C-Bomber, hoping that mom was fast asleep, and eternally thanking Micah for not fully closing or locking the side door.  *cha-ching!*  And so, yeah.  I'm happy with the week so far (with the exception of not having the notecards--but I plan to do them tonight) and I hope that the rest continues to be at this par.    You know what's the bomb about all of this?  All of the subpersonalities that make up "The Joe"--the teacher, the adviser, the business analyst, the teenager, the friend, the son, the brother, the joker, the intellectual, the perverted bastard, the compassionate ear, the coffee-addict, the workaholic, the academic marvel--they all balanced.  Normally, you only see one or two of those in a given day, week, month, or whatever.  Joe is either an overgrown 5-year-old or a 45-year-old in a young man's body.  However, I feel like... a teenager for once.  Still not the average teenager, but not like an old man either.  I quote myself: *cha-ching*.  "To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead."  --Bertrand Russel,  Marriage and Morals

       Song in head:  Josh Groban  Current Mood:  Drained  Oh... today was pretty good until 1715.  Had a lot of fun at work, tried to go to the library and do notecards (because I left the Norton at school), but alas, they closed at 1700hrs... which just plain sucked.  That's ok.  Whenever I can convince someone to learn more about Union Terminal, alles gute. ;-)  Nonetheless, never finished my notecards, didn't study for Physics.  Bleh.  Then, at that 1715 turning point, went back to the CHM office b/c I left my water bottle.  Mom called... pissed that my car was so dangerous and she was clueless.  *shakes head*  Now, do you see why I wanted you to use that 3.5 G's to buy a new car?  *sslf*  However, kinda made up with Linda in a way b/c she was there to tell me that the recent amass of issues is no big deal.  Helps for reinforcement.  Then, refused to go home, so went to Kathy's... continued to work on the impossible puzzle with no edge, 5 extra pieces, and no picture on the box, and 750 pieces.  That's actually fun, go figure.  Then she talked to my mom... got her to simmer a bit.  Picked up some brake pads and Pothead Fred will be over tomorrow to change em up on LJ.  Thus, I have to hitch a ride w/ mom tomorrow and ride the bus home.  I think I'm actually gonna enjoy it--I'll get to sleep in the car, and catch up with the friends on the bus.  So yeah.  Nonetheless, hopefully LJ will only be out of commission for one day--I enjoy my freedom.    And I still wonder what the fuck it is about me that people like so much.  I mean, I just don't get it... Not as much with teens, but adults... they all cling to me like clothes in a dryer without Bounce.  It's almost like... scary, dude.  Of course, I can't let that "power" be put to bad uses.  *shoos away evil plots to make myself a straight A student*  So... yeah?  Weekend has been good, overall.  Not complaining.  Figuring out how to find $$ to cover all the gas I burned in the C-Bomber though... that's gonna be tough.  Schlafzimmer.... Warum kann ich nicht ein Maedchen finden, eh?  Das kann einen Apfel suchen.  Das ist zu suess.  Mmmmm....   Never mind... I'm gonna try and do notecards using the internet.  But if I fail, I'm going to get some rest.   A heating coil is placed in a thermally insulated tank of negligible heat capacity.  The tank contains 0.1 kg of water and 0.01 kg of ice, both initially at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius.  The power output of the coil is 100 watts and the output is independent of temperature.  Calculate each of the following; a) The heat transferred to the water and ice by teh hating coil in time  t .  (Write an equation using appropriate symbols for the amount of heat generated in time t)  b) The time  t1  necessary to melt all the ice (the laten heat of fusion of ice is 3.34x10^5 J/kg)  c) The additional time  t2  necessary to bring the water to a boil (the specific heat of water is 4.18x10^3 J/kg*degrees Celsius)    Answer:  Wow... If you can answer that problem, you have way too much time on your hands.   Score:  -- (Dash)

       Song in head:  Don't Stop Believing - Journey  Current Mood:  Bored  Well, slept in today at the aid of a sleep inducer, woke up around 1130, argued with mom about my college search (but not about my college search, apparently--she claims it was only a medium in which to address our communication issues -.-)  Came back to the hole after eating breakfast and wasing the dishes.  Watched "The American President" which is a really good movie that I haven't seen in a long time.  Kind of a love story, but not a totally mushy one, so alles gute.  Started to fly to Paris from London... all was fine until the computer started freezing up on me.  That kinda makes the FlightSim become rather unrealistic.  And hard to play at that end... it's like flying under a strobe light... but not nearly so frequently blinking.  Gah.  So now I'm listening to Journey and have no plans for the evening.  I really need to find a life of some sort.    I tell ya... I hate dilemmas.  Maybe not neccessarily dilemmas, but just things that are hard to do in general.  Things that you gotta say but are hard to say for one reason or another.  However, if everything was easy to say, I suppose life would be kinda boring and too easy.  Then again, as that one Filipino used to say "Joe, Ms. Yonka's full of shit."  Damn, if that aint an unneccessary ramble, I don't know what is.  I think I'm gonna try and swing up to Chicago during spring break.  Of course, that would mean I have to find a car to drive that was reliable, and also require finding some lodging.  I really don't want to bring mom along.  That would just kill the whole damn thing.  So, granted, it is a longshot, but one can dream, can't he?  OK, who am I kidding.  It's not gonna work.  *stuffs cruddy idea back into box*  It would be cool though.  Damn.  You know, I need a haircut.  However, I don't know how I'm gonna get it cut and try to grow it out at the same time.  It presents problems.  I guess I'll be heading to the salon.  That is, if I can milk the money-loser upstairs for $13.  Talk about longshot.  Damn, son.    Of course, I'm still bored.  But I have my Journey.  TTFN.   This is, like, the coolest song ever, man!!  Here we stand Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two. Sleepless nights Losing ground I'm reaching for you, you, you.  Feelin' that it's gone Can change your mind If we can't go on To surveive the tide love divides  Someday love will find you  Break those chains that bind you One night will remind you How we touched And went our separate ways If he ever hurts you True love won't desert you You know I still love you Though we touched  And went our separate ways  Troubled times Caught between confusion and pain Distant eyes Promises we made were in vain  If you must go, I wish you love You'll neve walk alone Take care my love Miss you love....

       Song in head:  Law & Order Theme  Current Mood:  ?    know,  v.t., 1. have full evidence.  2. be fully informed or skilled.  3. have as an acquaintance.  4. recognize   So, I ask of all this:  What in life do you really know?  Is it possible to know anything, per se?  I do not believe so.  You may argue that you know yourself.  I believe that no one knows themselves, and no one else knows them.  Such is life, it sha'n't be argued.  Nonetheless, we argue that we know things.  We argue that facts, interests, people, personalities, are known by us, and if not by us, then another human.  In theory, by flawed modern logic, if everyone were added together, then everything would be known.  (This, of course excludes knowledge of events yet to happen--in the future).  But, no, my friends, truth is the exact opposite.  We know absolutely nothing.  In fact, we do not even know what knowing is (which is why we are confused on the topic to begin with).  Now I, fellow citizens of the earth, also do not claim to know anything, and, also do not claim to know what I am talking about here.  This, in itself, as theory suggests, would be a fallacy in the logic, creating a hole in my argument.  However, this provides a good segway into the argument itself, and the thesis thereof.  As Webster's Dictionary has told us, in order to "know" something, we must "have full evidence" or "be  fully  informed or skilled."  This is where the problem lies, ladies and gentlemen, because no one human being can possibly have  full evidence  of anything.  I believe that I will be backed when I say that no one person can be in multiple places at the same time.  Furthermore, I believe that I will be backed when I say that no one person can see every "side" of every situation, problem, or event.  Thus, how can one person claim to have "full evidence," eh?    This, of course, does not only apply to events, but also to persons.  No two people can possibly be around each other 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.  No two people, as of today's modern technology, and truly read each other's minds and feel the exact same feelings.  Thus, no one person can  know  another person in the true sense of the word.  What we see and what we think--these are perceptions.  These are the perceptions which form who we are, who we socialize with, what we say, what we think about ourselves and others.  These are the perceptions which grant the false sense of "knowing" anything.  Take that into consideration, my brothers and sisters.  Imagine that--something that we all tend to take for granted--so simple, yet so eternally complex.  --Joe "Unibomber" Scalf

       Song in head:  Puff the Magic Dragon - Peter, Paul and Mary  Current Mood:  Ready to retire  Puff, the magic dragon Lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist In a land called Hannalee Little Jackie Baker Loved that rascal Puff And brought him strings and sealing wax And other fancy stuff  Puff, the magic dragon Lived by the sea And frolicked in the autum mist In a land called Hannalee Together they would travel On a boat with billowed sail Jackie kept a lookout perched On Puff's gigantic tail Noble kings and princes Would bow and ere the came Pirate ships would lower their flags When Puff roared out his name  A dragon lives forever But not so little boys Painted wings and giant strings Make way for other toys One gray night it happened Jackie Baker came no more And Puff that mighty dragon,  He ceased his fearless roar  His head was bent in sorrow And his green scales fell like rain Puff no longer went to play Along the cherry lane Without his life-long friend Puff could not be brave So Puff the mighty dragon Sadly slipped into his cave  Oh, Puff the magic dragon Lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist In a land called Hannalee  And now, I shall put down my hookah and go to bed.  Good night, all.  "During the summer of 1910, Conrad Schaffer often sat on his front porch listening to birds singing in the trees in front of his house.  He had planted the trees along the curb fourteen years earlier.  Most Westwood residents planted trees along the streets to make the neighborhood more beautiful.  This year Contrad's trees were tall and full enough to offer cool shade.  the lovely trees made him appreciate Westwood even more because there had not been many trees in the West End."             --Cincinnati Historical Society,  Cincinnati: An Urban History

       Song in head:  Obsession - Animotion  Current Mood:  good day  Ah, today, in hindsight, kicked ass.  I made record time on the way to school this morning, arrived at 0725, but was ON TIME!!!  Yay... Of course, there was a test in English, the class that I don't think I've been to in about a week and a half... *shrugs*  Don't know, don't care.  Coffman can suck it.  *evil cackling*  Had loads of fun last night with a little venture of mine, which only one of you knows about.  Damn, that waitress was hot.... Just kidding!  (Audience thinks:  "Joe?  Laid?  What the fuck?  That  must  be a lie.")  So yeah, i was up 'til, maybe 0130/0200 or so.  Anyhow, back to today, went to German, laughed it up, then got out of German for an assembly... *yess!*  Went to Physics, then Burgess got mildly ticked at me, then I had to run to the office, and created an amusing anecdote... So I had to walk outside, ground was wet, so my shoes were squeaking on the floor as I walked.  I came back into the science room and Lilly said "Your shoes squeak too much."  So, still being in my "spread the hate" mood from Saturday night, rubbed my feet on the floor, creating an awful, nasty noise, and she cringed...  But then Burgess looked me in the eye, and in the meanest tone I've ever heard from him says "Sick... Just sick."  Oh, he was so pissed.  So, I actually did some work in there, which wasn't so bad.  Then, got my palm pilot back *like cha!* but the battery was dead, of course, because the math monarch wouldn't let me turn it off *sslf*  Then ran some errands for the office, and had an interesting little "chat" with Virginia Rhoades, the 7th/8th grade asst. principal.  (See AIM Profile)  Meteoro test was postponed, and we watched a video...which was the VHS version of the OMAX movie "Stormchasers."  Good shit it was.  Then math went OK... i tell ya, if I get any smoother, I'm gonna be scared.  I had to make up a quiz and taught myself the material while taking it... *silly math monarch... leaving the room and silly girl in front of me who went to sit on the other side of the room w/ her crush but leaving her book wide open to the lesson right on top of the desk*  He he he he... *evil cackling*  I only knew two of the four questions w/o cheating, so I'm happy now. :-D  Then, Grunder's, where, since we're behind, our notes were handed out to us in outline form rather than hearing a lecture.  I have to do my notecards that were due today in order to get late credit tomorrow, and, with the curve, I may just get a 70% on that last test... Not bad for ganking half the answers... *bad Joe.. bad!*  do dooo doo...  So yeah, a kickass day.  Then went to refuel the C-Bomber... *silly Mutti* and came back home... and here I am.  The night is young, fellow peoples... but I still must take a shower... TTYL.  "The soul fortunately, has an interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in the eye."  --Charlotte Bronte,  Jane Eyre

       Song in head:  Road Trippin' - Red Hot Chili Peppers  Current Mood:  Pretty damn happy  So it's Super Bowl Sunday... woo party... not.  As I say, "big whoop."  I don't intend to watch the damn thing, obviously.  After that pathetic half-time show a couple years ago, I lost all faith in the big bowl.  Plus, it's football... and football tends to suck, in my opinion.  So yeah.    Had fun last night, mostly.  Went to Tri-County Mall and walked around w/ John and Jesse.  Bought some choco-covered espresso beans, then cruised around... ended up in K-Wood, go figure.  Visited Kathy at Old Navy, where I got a prima billig deal on a hoodie--$4.89.  Yess....  Also snagged a black dress shirt- mehr kuhl bohnen.  Then brought the happy couple back to Tri-County so Jesse could go home, and went to Steak n' Shake for a late-night dinner with Kathleen, Eileen, and Annie.  Not to my surprise, it was almost de ja vu as Eileen and Annie were going nuts drawing signs that say "We're horny, call this #!" *shakes head*  I think the most awkward thing was that the restaurant was so fucking quiet and we were all laughing it up... Oh well.  We didn't get kicked out, so alles gute.  Then came home.  Alles so viel spass machen!!  (Lots of fun.)  Went to work today.  That was fun.  Covered the door for the first 1.5 hrs, then swung over to Starbucks, and went down to do my interview of the campaign ppl.  That was a lot of fun.  Caught up w/ Bev, who I haven't seen in a long time, and found out quite a bit about the campaign.  Wrote my article (nearly 1.75 pages... it'll have to hit the chop block) but zonked out after 45 mins... so went up for ice cream, then snagged a coke... got going to finish up.  Then went back upstairs to drop off mom's voter reg. card and talked to Faith for a little while.  And I  finally  snagged another positive comment on the "new look."  Not that I care, really, but the annoying thug/murderer/rapist/scary guy/sniper comments were just getting annoying.  Thus, hearing an "It looks good on you." was nice.  Then hopped back in the C-Bomber and came home, so here I am.    Mom wants me to run to the store, so I reckon I'll do that, then come back to work on the notecards... Silly Scooter.  Thus, alles gute, einmal gegen.    At least I was wrong about 97.3 getting the axe... it was 97.7.  *phew*  worried me there for a while.    Well, let's see... I'm feeling like a poem this evening.    Running  by Richard Wilbur    1933 (North Caldwell, NJ)   What were we playing?  Was it prisoner's base? I ran with whacking keds Down the cart-road past Richard's place, And where it dropped beside the tractor-sheds  Leapt out into the air above a blurred  Terrain, through jolted light,  Took two hard lopes, and at the third Spanked off a hummock-side exactly right,  And made the turn, and with delighted strain Sprinted across the flat By the bull-pen, and up the lane. Thinking of happiness, I think of that.

        Wow... Just... Wow...     Song in head:  The tweeting of the gas meter...  Current Mood:  Hell fuckin' yeah!  Okay.  I shall start by saying that today was a very good day... Probably the best day since... uh.... well, it was awesome, that's all that matters.  The Skinny: Got my coffee at the chateau this morning and still got to school early.  Started watching the movie "The Importance of Being Earnest" in English (which is quite funny mind you).  Got a 95 on my German test (big surprise).  Switched up double bells so that the Physics test on Friday will be a double bell, and we'll have a single bell tomorrow.  I had real work to do in the office.  (But they stuck me in there with a girl who had whooping cough, and didn't tell me until I had already sat there for a half hour--Grrrus!)  Watched a video in Astronomy.  Finished my math homework.  Played Tetris all the way through 6th and 7th bells (and still took notes on the APUS lecture, mind you!)    Stopped by the house, ran to the bank, got some gas, went down to CMC for OMNI.  Made up some bullshit about needing to leave early at 1730.  Glad I did too, because the three demos to learn were Muster at Ft. Washington, the Civil War Knapsack, and the Fur Trader.  All of which, I have done before, and knew all about.  But I got to leave early he he he.    Went to John's.  Installed my car stereo, which went in fine, and now works... WORKS!!  I have a CD player again!  Went over to Rave and saw what I think is the best film I've seen in a very long time....  Hit the B&N Starbucks afterwards, then came home.    All in all, excluding the contagious effie, it's just been one hell of a good day.  I'm long overdue.  Hopefully, a precursor to a good break also.  :-D  Anyhow... I'm afraid I must read Norton, for we do have a test tomorrow.  Bis dann, my friends!  Moral Fiber...  It's what it's all about.

        Crash Into Me...     Song in head:  "Joe's Mix #2" - The New Compliation Album  Current Mood:  Kinda Disappointed  Okay, so I just got back from Target.  I picked up the color roll of pictures.  After careful examination of them, I have determined that Mr. Shaky Hands over here really needs to invest in a tripod if he intends to do anything with this photography business.  The outdoor shots, and most of the well-lit ones came out OK, but most of them were indoors, and... well, they're pretty damn blurry.  Thus, I dread the B&W film that is currently in the camera... Even more of those are indoors... and there isn't even one that was mounted stationary (like one of the best pictures out of the color roll was).  Eh, I came out okay.  I'm just learning.  But a tripod... Yeah, I need that.    Anyhow... the day was okay.  Only three more.  Counting down... and 37 until the big end, 33 until SENIOR-dom.  bwa ha ha.   *click click click*   FUCK!!   *click click click*   Burgess is gonna fill out a rec for me to get on yearbook staff next year.  Hopefully I'll make it.  I'm in tight with the editor-in-chief, and he was really pleased to see me signing up.  Plus, I'll be a SENIOR, which makes me a demigod of sorts.  That will be fun.    *click click click*   SON OF A MOTHER FUCKING COCK SUCKING ASS WIPING BITCH!!!   *click click click*  At least I got two really good pictures out of that roll.  One of me performing magic on the Cincinnatus statue by the red doors, and the other of mom looking like a stoned pothead, sticking out her tongue.  OOOO... the black mail.  bwa ha ha   Brew ha ha, indeed, my smart ass friend!  I don't have to spell!   As you can see, I've got nothing... So I'll leave you with this...  THOMAS:  Sorry to disturb your other work Franklin, but this IS English class.  Maybe you could do a  little  English? PERRY:  Well, try harder next time. THOMAS:  You know... coming from any student other than Franklin, that would have sounded rude and obnoxious.... but for Mr. Perry here, it sounds... better than usual.  THOMAS:  Oscar Wilde reveals a great deal about human nature in this.  I mean... haven't you ever noticed that?  That when you're single, you couldn't buy attention, but as soon as you hook up with someone, then you've got all these offers? DOERMAN:  Ha... I know the first part is right. PERRY:  Well, you've got [muffled]. DOERMAN:  Franklin, he's not a boyfriend. SCALF:  (is taken aback) *nods and scratches chin* PERRY:  I'm sure someone will come yur way.o DOERMAN:  I don't know... I don't even know what I want in a guy. PERRY:  Well, as long as he's hot right?  I mean, that's all I look for in a girl. DOERMAN:  (returns to work)  Franklin, shut up.  (has extreme difficulty getting the last bit of ink out of a pen) SCALF:  (to self)  Lord, what I'd give for a black ball point pen right now.... THOMAS:  (still bumbling about)  You'll all understand when you get older and you're married.    WRIGHT:  Where the hell were you? SCALF:  REM meeting. WRIGHT:  Oh, that would explain it.  Did you get here early again today? SCALF:  Yeah. WRIGHT:  Did you get that parking spot? SCALF:  Yeah. WRIGHT:  Did you make the move? SCALF:  No. WRIGHT:  Why not? SCALF:  Because I'm doubting whether or not it's what I really want. WRIGHT:  But it's something, isn't it?  I mean... you don't want to end up like Paul do you? SCALF:  Ha, I'll never be like Paul.  I at least have interests.  SCALF:  I wish it were easier to skip classes still. BURGESS:  What? SCALF:  Well, just when I get old enough to figure out the system, you all throw in this technology BS, and it makes it impossible to get away with.  Now, I'll graduate, and will have never skipped a class. BURGESS:  *laugs*  (sarcastically)  What a shame... SCALF:  Just for one day.  I really hate math... well, not math, just the teacher. BURGESS:  I'll be sure to tell the administration to move backwards so that you can start cutting.  *shakes head*    From:  Anonymous.  Here's a hint...

        Ghetto Overload...     Song in head:  Music?  Is that what you call this garbage?  Current Mood:  Displeased  Okay, so the routine went as normal yesterday.  Starbucks for lunch, get some discount by flirting with the girl behind the counter, come back to CMC, and work on The Inside Track, then head to Kathy's for dinner, leave around 2100.  I did manage to take quite a few pictures though at different points during the day.  The museum is really dim, so I'm not sure if they'll come out really good, but we shall see.  Fell asleep while doing my homework last night.  I was glad I did though.  Got home around 2130, then wanted to hit the books right off, but mom thought otherwise.  She decided to have one of her "deep conversations" which lasted to 2245, then I went downstairs... and she was still hounding me about stuff.  *shrugs*  I don't know... and I don't really care... HAH.  So a new family moved into the upstairs apartment as of yesterday.  By all observations, they appear to be... how to phrase gently... white trash.  I've only met the one girl, who is apparently 16, but looks much older, possesses quite a slutty air, listens to blazing hip hop (like that which is playing right outside my door right now while she's putting crap in the basement) and smokes Marlboros.  And oh yeah... I didn't get too good of a look, but she appears to be missing a tooth or two.  Wow.  I really could take the hip hop... I like it in small doses, or when I'm in the right mood.  But I was looking forward to a nice nap when I got home, because of the rain.  Well, that's blown.  It's kinda made me come to the realization that I really have been spoiled by the recent time since Bobby moved out.  Pretty much, we've had this humongous house all to ourselves... and I really liked it.  It was a good six months or so, at least.  Anyhow... this kinda sucks, but oh well.    Four days until Spring Break.  "Woo party" as Amber would say.  Eh, maybe.  Ms. Holt (one of the six assistant principals) asked me today if I was "ready" for spring break.  I just kinda said "Eh."  I don't have much planned, and after I come back, I'll have to bust mondo ass, considering that AP exams are at the beginning of May.    Dr. Morton approved a waiver of my AP Exam fees... saving the motherly one about $164.  That was cool.  He's still got it I tell ya.    Well, not too much going on here, and it's probably gonna be a rather boring day for the duration.  Thus, I'll talk to ya later I suppose.

        Lunch at 12:30...     Song in head:  The Leaving Song, Pt. II - AFI  Current Mood:  Bored  So here I am on Linda's computer, and I'm typing in my blog because I have absolutely nothing to do right now.  Bah to all of that.  I have my camera... I could go take a few pictures, but at some point today I have to do my notecards.  Bleckamundo.  At least Linda is in charge today and Rebecca is off in Chicago... Thus, maybe the day will be kinda fun.  I dunno... we shall see.  Why am I typing this?  Well, if I look like I'm working by typing something, then I can stay in the office, instead of going out to float... There is no point in that--hell, we don't even open for another five minutes.  Anyhow, I shall be back here later... I have time later to do The Inside Track.  eh.  I just don't know.

        Nobody Said It Was Easy...     Song in head:  The Scientist - Coldplay  Current Mood:  Indescribable  Well, considering that I have to work tomorrow, I suppose that the weekend really is over now.  It's been good in hindsight, I do reckon.  Got out of Habitat early on Friday, because Jan wasn't there and Helen really had nothing,  nothing  for me to do.  So I slid on up to Warsaw, took out 60 from my check, which left 15 added to the savings.  Went out to dinner with Kathleen at Outback and then drove around for awhile.  It was nice to "see her off" before leaving for her big trip.  I woked an evening event on Friday, where I dealt with 200 of the most drunk people I have ever encountered.  It was downright funny at points, so I was more than happy to be entertained.  Registered for the SAT... cutting it way down to the wire, but at least I got registered in time to still be able to take it at Walnut on May 1 before it got full.  So there's something.  Left CMC around... 0015 I suppose, after writing a bunch of smartass shit on Kristen's desk calendar/doodle pad.  Picked up some White Castle and some coffee on the way home, but came home and just crashed.  That was nice.  Had a dentist appointment this morning at 1015.  I haven't been in about three years.  Dr. Sander was like "Gee, Joe... where ya been?  Hiding from us?"  But the hygenist cleaned my teeth, polished them, and the dentist came in, looked around for about 3 minutes and was like... "You know it's amazing... guy like you who never comes in... never gets any cavities..."  I have managed to escape the drill yet again... no cavities yet in my life... knock on wood.  Also, the hygenist was like "Did you ever get braces?"  "No."  "Dang... you were certainly lucky to get such nice straight teeth then."  *shrugs*  She must have missed the massive overbite... but hey... it's what they can see, right?  So I came back home, and Elyse (the babysitter) apparently finds it so cool to hang out at our house every Saturday.  Well, long story short, I was in a good mood from the dentist, and she was being a tad flirtacious... it was funny.  More stories to go along with that upon request.  ;-)  (NO... not THOSE kind of stories... you sick little fuckers)  Thus, while mom's friend Stephanie was over, Elyse and I had an "interesting" conversation.... "Well, you're not crazy, really.  You're just... unique.  I've never met anyone like you before."  She also stated that she was glad to finally have a conversation with me, as opposed to me hiding out in my room... he he he.  By the end of the day, she was definitely "smitten" as John might say...  So then I headed out to West Chester to meet up with Mr. Mac.  I had yet another little confidence booster as this girl in a green volkswagen passed me on Union Centre Boulevard, then I passed her, and she followed me... all the way into the subdivision, then pulled into a space and left.  He he he he... Hell, I'll say she was chasing me if I want to.  There's nothing to say otherwise, right?   So, met up with John... His dad said something like "You're not Scottish, are you?"  "Well, no.  I'm mostly Irish."  "Oh, well then have a Guinness."  (of which there were a six-pack sitting on the table)  "Seriously?"  "No."  "Well, then why did you taunt me like that?  That's just cruel."  "Well, I'm not really a Guinness fan anyhow... I prefer Cream Stouts... Mmmm..."  "Well, I'll certainly be happy to take them off your hands then... I'll even give you the bottles back so that you can use them for that home brew you make."  "Let's see.... I would, but it's illegal, if nothing else."  "Oh, you're no fun."  So then we migrated southward... to Starbucks after picking up an el cheapo chess set from the Madeira Kroger.  (we've been long complaining about only having checkers at Starbucks).  We stayed at starbucks for... uh... about 2.5 hrs... when they closed.  Ended up with one draw, and I took one Stalemate... bah.  Then, so wired that we went to Steak n Shake... then crashed.  So here I am... listening to my personal mix of slow music.  The upcoming week is the last one before Spring Break.  It holds an English quiz, a German test, a Physics test, a math test, a History test, and a DBQ.  *chills*  In case you're wondering, that's every class except Astronomy... we took our test on Friday.    Wow... what a long-ass entry.  Really sorry about that... but it's been a busy couple of days.    As for deep thoughts... I have a few, I suppose.  The most prevalent one is that if one more person "warns" me about who I'm friends with, there's gonna be words.  The count is up to four... five... would make me sick.    It's been a good weekend.  Actually, a very good weekend.  In the top five... for sure.  Anyhow... this crazy mutha fucka is goin off ta bed.  G'night, all.

        He's Damn Right You Know...     Song in head:  New York Minute - The Eagles  Current Mood:  Contemplative  Harry got up, dressed all in black, went down to the station, and he never came back.  They found his clothing scattered somewhere down the track, and he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning.  He had a home, the love of a girl, but men get lost sometimes as years unfurl.  One day he had crossed some line and he was too much in this world, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

I thought it was gonna suck, but it was very intriguing.   Crime and Punishment in Suburbia .  Quite the interesting little film, if I do say so myself.  Afterwards, I had to do some more chores *blec* and then I chilled for a little bit.  Eventually, I went out with my camera and got some good pictures.  I decided to use up an old roll of the color film that I had lying around before I put in the black&white stuff.  Thus, just a few "experimental" shots from places around town.  It was fun, and a damn good excuse to get out of the house after being cooped up all day.    Had to stop at Krogers to pick up cheese, and ran into Mike Mains, who used to go to Walnut.  I haven't seen him in a long time.  It was kinda cool to catch up, and he gave me free ribs from Outback.  You really can't beat that now, can ya?  So I came home, ate dinner, and goofed off a little bit, taking more stupid pictures.  Mom saw my desktop wallpaper... it's the cover art to "Make Yourself", the Incubus album.  She's like... "Is that meteorology stuff?"  *shakes head*  Oh well, she means well, I suppose.    But I have to finish this paper, and get ready for the ultra-long day tomorrow.  Talk to ya later.  In a New York Minute, everything can change.  In a New York Minute, things are getting pretty strange.  In a New York Minute, everything can change.  In a New York Minute...  That sure as hell felt like a New York Minute.  I know it's longer... but it sure felt like one.  *shakes head*  Back to the box with you... at least until tomorrow... hopefully... please?

        Friday Night I Crashed Your Party, Saturday I said I'm sorry, Sunday Came I Trashed it Out Again...     Song in head:  Absolutely (Story of a Girl) - Nine Days  Current Mood:  Drained  Running too long... on limited fuel... eeeeee....  Drained...  I got to school this morning at 0715, ahead of time, of course.  Shut off the car after parking and was like "I don't have the energy for first bell."  So I drove to UDF, got some coffee, and pulled in a parking lot and took a nap whilst listening to Morning Edition on VXU.  However, I was still so drained... Nonetheless, I went through the day, mostly slaphappy.  For example, during hour three of the Wonderful Burgess Science Chunk, we went into the lab and looked at maps of the moon, and described them:    Joe:  "Okay... on to Mare Crisium." Jasmine:  "Hmm... here it is."  (measures diameter of anomaly with ruler) "10.4 cm." Joe:  "10.4... got it.  Distinguishing characteristic?" Jasmine:  "Well, there are fewer craters in the center... and the edges are clearly defined." Joe:  "Okay, sounds good." (picks up pencil) "Let's see... Clearly defined mountains at edge on east side... near Kenwood.  Looks like a nice place for sledding in the winter." Jasmine:  "Did you actually write that?" Joe:  "Oh hell yeah.  Would I lie to you?...  Just a little tired."  I played Tetris all the way through the history lecture.  Probably not good for someone who is lucky to pull off a C (which isn't looking much different this qtr... uh oh)  However, I still took more notes than probably 80% of the class, and I get the lecture questions right on the test, contrary to the other fuckheads in the class.    Well, the other stuff happened, but I'm too tired for much detail... So... RAPID FIRE!  Came home.  Ate a little bit.  Went down to CMC for ice cream with Clare and Kathleen.  Talked to an old lady, who was excited about the bracelets she bought to go a dance that night... and made a TOTAL ASS out of myself by saying random shit, because I couldn't understand her.  Got my first "photo class."  Drove off with the camera sitting on the trunk.  Drove two blocks.  Realized I drove off without the camera.  Was pissed, and scared.  Came back to CMC.  Camera was on the ground.  Luckily, it all still works.  No damage.  *phew*  Tremor in hand grew out of control.  Calmed down.  Went to pick up Micah.  Came home.  Left again to try to get film.  Photo stores were closed.  Went to Steak n' Shake for a chocolate malt.  Came home.  Forced Micah to do his project.  Fell asleep in the recliner.  Mom got home.  Went downstairs.  Fell asleep during West Wing.  Woke up in the middle of Law & Order.  Forced Micah to do his project (yes, again).  Took Micah home at 0030.  He bought me dinner at McDonald's in return for my trouble... they only offer 7 items between 12 and 4 am or whatever.  "Sir, we  only have  what's on that red sign... nothing more.  There are no double cheeseburgers!"  Dropped off Micah.  Bought gas, where I paid a week's pay for a tank of gas.  Came home.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Deep thought:  Wow... running on fumes... kinda sucks.  jdmac020: *boom* BoeseGeschichte: go boom yourself, bitch jdmac020: Did you just call me a dodo bird?

        44 Days...     Song in head:  New York State of Mind - Billy Joel  Current Mood:  Multitude  Today was actually a pretty good day, but I'm just kinda sitting here.  In so many ways, I'm beyond caring.  I've entered the Burgess Zone... I've cared for so long, and now, it's just not worth it.    Started a new book in English, embarassed the Frau (three times), did well (hopefully) on a Physics test after using my study time to discuss the topic of relationships with an emancipated bisexual (*is amazed at how messed up that sounds*), had a lab in Meteorology that we had already done in Physics before, started Permutations and Combinations in Pre-Cal, and discussed Internment in APUS, where I am still one of three who take notes on the lectures.    Drove to Habitat, did the deposit, did the mail, did some filing, recorded a voicemail message.  I'm debating the benefits of that job now, which is kinda scary.  I have to stick it out till the end of the year for my school credit, but after that I'm not sure.  Parked illegally downtown and went to Provident Camera to pick up my lens.  Got a killer deal--a 28-70mm zoom Sigma for $89.95 +tax.  So now I have a camera... next step is to learn how to use it.    Went to Starbucks after serving my civic duty, where I was questioned as to the identity of Mary Beth... (I went to Starbucks to read Norton).  And read Norton I did, my droogs.  Finished Chap. 27, and will finish 28 in Study Hall tomorrow to prep for the test 7th bell.    It feels so good to have a car again.  So, so, so good.  Almost as good as... never mind.  Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood.  Hop a flight to Miami Beach, or to Hollywood.  But I'm taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River Line.... I'm in a New York state of mind.   I've seen all the movie stars with their fancy cars and their limousines.  Been high on the Rockies under the Evergreens.  But I know what I'm needing, and I don't want to waste more time.  I'm in a New York state of mind.    It was so easy living day by day, out of touch with the rhythm and blues.  But now I need a little give-and-take, The New York Times, The Daily News...  It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me 'cause I bet it's life, I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside, I don't have any reason--left them all behind.  I'm in a New York state of Mind.  Is happiness truly an achievable goal?  Sure, many say so... but think about it.  Sometimes I wonder if happiness is really possible, at least for me.  No matter where I go or what I do, there's always some slap in the face, or an obstacle, or something like that, it seems.  Maybe the day will come when I'll feel differently.  I'll definitely be happy then.  *shrugs*  I'm just going through the motions.

        Some People...     Song in head:  You've Got a Friend - James Taylor  Current Mood:  Indifferent  As predicted, here's your follow-up:  There's a saying that I've grown quite fond of when analyzing people, and why they do the stupid shit that they do... "It takes all kinds."  Of course, short for "It takes all kinds of people to make up this great world of ours."  It really does I suppose.  The world as we know it is a very complex place, filled with all sorts of feelings, from conflict to peace, love to hate.  I mean, life might be a hell of a lot easier if the fucking bastards were sucked out of it, but then again, life would probably also be very boring, as Ms. Yonka would say.    However, this is not the point... well, it is kinda.  Hell, I don't know.  I guess that no matter how many times I say this, I still wonder... "What the fuck is this moron thinking, eh?"  Some people just wouldn't know a good opportunity or asset if it fucking came up and slapped their ugly face.  Some get everything handed to them on a silver platter, then they take a taste of the caviar, then spit it in the fact of the butler and say "Where the hell did you get this 99 cent shit, eh?"  Hence... some people.  Some people piss me off.    Of course, this isn't a problem with me tonight.  Sure, the contact at the event was a bitch... a clueless bitch at that, but I just made a point of avoiding her unless absolutely neccessary.  That's not a problem.  You see, sometimes the problems befall ourselves, and sometimes befall the ones we love.  Either way, these idiots kinda make you think... "Does that guy really have a brain, or just a cheap imitation peanut?"  Hell, call me crazy, call me silly, call me deep, call me random, I don't care.  This is what's on my mind...  Then again, I could say "Why the fuck do I even care?  It's not my problem."  *ponders calling myself crazy*  I just don't know.  It pisses me off for some odd reason...  Well, I know why, but that's not the fucking point.  *is done; moves on to next topic*  However, despite the awkwardness of working with Bennie tonight, I really did have an OK time at the evening event.  When I get to be in charge, it kinda gives me this false impression that my job is going somewhere... that maybe... just maybe, I have a  chance  to prove myself and explore new opportunities.  As Bennie said, "If you're not going to learn with every experience, then what's the point?"  That's OK... I'm out of the hole in 18 months anyhow... I don't know why I really care.  I've gotten a hell of a lot farther than most seniors do... so I'm not too bad off, I do reckon.  That's OK... It's money in the pocket.  Money is important to have.  Very helpful for things like... gas?  oh yeah.  I'm going into Habitat tomorrow--a Monday--in order to make up all my missed days.  I'm gonna prob. have to come in every day this week to make up all of them.  *isn't sure whether to sob or be happy*  Eh, Jan won't be there, but I'll tell Jan on Tuesday that I can come in, but only if she has space and work for me.   I get to drive to school again... I am so excited... It's like... a long lost joy to be able to once-again navigate the gruddy streets of Cincinnati to scratch out of the West Side and over to the East Side once again... like I do... every day?  Yeah... EVERY DAY.  School five days a week, Kathy's on Sundays... and usually I find my way over to Kenwood at some given point every Saturday also.  Damn.  *really needs to check into getting that permanent visa for the lands east of Interstate 75 and Vine*  Well, I think I'm finally gonna go to sleep.  Oh yeah... that sounds good...  But maybe I'll burn another CD first... *cackling of the evil variety*  A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys, Painted wings and giant's rings Make room for other toys One gray night it happened Jackie Baker came no more And Puff that mighty dragon,  He ceased his fearless roar! His head was bent in sorrow Green scales fell like rain Puff no longer went to play  Along the cherry lane Without with life-long friend Puff could not be brave So Puff the mighty dragon Sadly slipped into his cave.  Puff the magic dragon,  Lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist In a land called Hannalee.  It really is about a dragon, damnit!  ;-)

        That's What It's All About, Joe...     Song in head:  Iris - Goo Goo Dolls  Current Mood:  Getting Tired  So here I am, working an evening event that I don't even think I signed up for.  *is still puzzled*  However, the money will come in handy.  I've calculated it out... this check coming on Friday will be 58% higher than my average check... and the next one... higher by 90%.  Considering that my base salary has to go towards gas and other automotive BS, it's nice to have a little extra.  Furthermore, I've got mom's income tax return all settled out, and my ceiling for that camera lens is $120... so I'll have $80 left over in the checking account at minimum.  This is good--I miss my financial buffers.  Of course, try this on for size... I've calculated the net pay on my next two paychecks, then deducted mandatory expenses... this is what I have done with all the downtime tonight.  Kinda sad.  Anyhow, I got back here around 1805, ran into Bennie and was like "Where do you want me to go?"  So he says, "Oh, well that's up to you... You're the one running the show.  I'm only here because they say they need an adult... someone over 21, you know..."  "Oh, well, nobody told me I was in charge... Are you sure?"  "Oh yeah, you're the one who knows all this stuff.  I'm just here to learn, more of a technicality."    *shakes head*  I really don't mind being in charge, but... I don't know.  It just feels so awkward to be the "manager" over a man who is 48 years older than you, and, by all means, really does outrank you.  Oh well.  Not caring sounds right up my alley right now.  All of the guests are confined to the landing, and talking to Bennie was getting old, so now I'm up here writing in my blog... he he he.  fun fun stuff.  More later, perhaps, I am unsure.  I just wish the break room was still open, or that I would be important enough to get a CD4 key... but that's another story.

        If I Could Change the World...     Song in head:  You've Got a Friend - James Taylor  Current Mood:  Reminiscent  Eh, you can see the much earler "year in review" blog post--I think it's in January somewhere.  I don't really feel like writing all that over again.  However, I'm looking back, and time has gone by so fast.  Pretty much, month by month, starting with June 03, I can pick a certain high point, and the rest blurs together.  Yet, so little seemed to change as each month went by... but now... 9 months later... in comparison... whoa.  I have changed so much-- I listen to different music, I hang out with a new crowd, I play different roles than before, I have hair... the list goes on.  So, as time continues to go on, and Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald continues to play, and the 17th birthday, I realize, is less than 10 weeks away, life continues to throw curveballs, and somehow I manage to keep getting hits... some are line drives, some are home runs, some are fouls or strikes, but I seem to be batting better than 500, which is pretty damn good.    So, I've seen the past.  I'm seeing the present.  Now what am I going to see?  What does the future hold for YHN?  If I knew, why would I still be breathing, eh?  Each day I wake in order to get to the next day... if I knew what the next day had, then why would I need to wake up?  At least I know that every day, I will be able to spell "traveler" correctly.  Hah!  Caught ya!  Put away those squinty eyes and stop calling me names.    So Eric Clapton is on now...  This was my favorite song in 4th grade.  It played at the United Way Annual Meeting in 99.  I just wrote the subject line, and it has nothing to do with what this is about... hmmm...  I at least got the factory radio back in the car... Stupid Nissan is making the installation of an aftermarket difficult.  However, I think I'm gonna buy my camera lens tomorrow.  I may go to Pete's if they're open early... If not, then run down to Provident on my lunch break... Unless they're closed.  That's highly possible.  *is mildly excited about opening the camera box for the first time... AGAIN*    I'll sit back and drink my coffee from the Chateau, then realize it's cold, be mildly disgusted, and ponder going to get more, with a side of burgers.  Fun stuff.  But I have a car to call my own now... one that has PICKUP!!    "My best friend took a weeks vacation to forget her, his girl took a weeks worth of Valium and slept, now he's guilt-stricken sobbing with his head on the floor, thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says, "I can't be held responsible, 'cause she was touching her face, I won't be held responsible, she fell in love in the first place!"  For the life of me, I cannot remember what made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise... For the life of me, I could not believe that we'd ever die for these sins... We were merely Freshmen.  (*original phrase censored - state-approved response follows*) And people wonder why I'm Pro-Choice... Bah.  Fuck, I'm out of gold stars...

        "Scars are souvenirs you never lose; The past is never far..."     Song in head:  Cheers Theme - Phish  Current Mood:  Eh, pretty pleased, I suppose.  Today has been very interesting.  After having a very good “night on the town” last night, I woke up in a good mood.  We went to pick up mom’s new car, and she’s happy with it (*thank God*).  We then ate a noon breakfast at Bob Evans, followed by a trip to Dillard’s.  They were having a mondo sale… most items 75% off… Thus, I bought an ultra-snazzy black leather jacket at a bargain basement price of $48.50, down from $195.00.  *he he he*  Then I went to Best Buy, where good old Travis gave me the DIN tools I needed to take the stereo out of LJ—allowing me to scrap the hunk of shit.  (He also has a flat tire now—go figure)  However, he didn’t have the actual time to do it, but he told me how.  Thus, I stopped at Home Depot to pick up some wire crimpers and went to work.  I got out both stereos ok, but had some trouble dismantling the factory one out of the Nissan.  Nonetheless, I got it taken apart and fixed the new one in place.  I then went out to the car to change the wiring harness (where you plug in an adapter and cut all the wires, rejoining them to a different adapter so you can use the new stereo).  That presented little to no problems.  Of course, though, this car being a Nissan, it has a weirdo fucked-up power supply cord for the stereo receiver.  But I plugged it in, and got some juice… then it didn’t work.  Also, now the fan for the heat/A.C. doesn’t work.  The AC will come on, and you can hear it hum, but that doesn’t do any good because the car isn’t gonna blow out any air.  *steam erupts from ears*  So after trying to figure it out, then taking out the adapter, and reinstalling the factory stereo (which now also doesn’t work), I drive back over to Best Buy.  Travis had gone home, and the guy there told me it was probably a fuse.  Well, that’s great.  I blew a fuse, and there’s a big ass hole in my center console.  Big fun.  So, I attempted to figure out the blown fuse, checking also the ones under the hood (which got my hands all greasy), couldn’t find which one blew, so I went back home.   I reinstalled the new stereo… it looks real nice!  BUT IT DOESN’T WORK!!  And now I have no fan… if the weather is nice, I’ll be OK long enough to wait.  *blec*  But still, I’m in a good mood.  I picked up an $18 CD Burner last night at MicroCenter (really $70, but with $52 in rebates)  Thus, I have new CD’s… for free!!!  I’m so happy :-D  I also have that new coat, and soon I will have my new camera lens, to replace the old broken one on the Nikon… which means I can start to use that camera that’s been sitting in my room for about the last 18 months.  Get to go to work tomorrow… big fun.  The babysitter will be over again tonight so that mom can go out… but at least this time I will be able to leave the house.  I was hoping to be able to listen to my new CD’s in my new car, wearing my new jacket… Damn, sometimes I love the IRS.  ;-)  (Yet at the same time, it’s an $18 CD burner, $10 worth of blank CD’s, $3 for the wire crimpers on the stereo… the only extravagant thing really is the $50 jacket, and all that only comes up to $71… Oh hellz yeah.)    So what’s in store for tonight?  I don’t know… maybe driving around aimlessly.  That shall work indeed.  I refilled my Starbucks Card last night, so I can get some coffee perhaps.  *shrugs*  We shall see indeed.  Even though the moment passed me by, I still can’t turn away. It’s all the dreams you never thought you’d lose,  Tossed along the way. Letters that you never meant to send,  Get lost or thrown away. And now we’re grown up orphans That never knew their names, We don’t belong to no one,  That’s a shame. But if you could hide beside me, maybe for awhile I won’t tell no one your name.  You know what?  Change really is the only constant in life.  Sometimes you want the change, sometime you don't.  Just like "Sometimes you feel like a nut... Sometimes you don't."  Of course, the solution to this one really isn't so simple as "Almond Joys have nuts; Mounds don't."  Bah... I really have something to say, but can't figure it out, so I'll quit wasting your time.  Have fun!!

        I almost forgot how funny this damn contract is...     Song in head:  11 AM - Incubus  Current Mood:  Better, and Laughing  Every person who buys a ticket for any dance at Walnut, including MORP (which I can't go to, because I'm already double-booked for the 26th) has to sign this contract in order to go... I find it more hilarious every time I read it... Here's a couple excerpts.  (Keep in mind:  Professional letter, letterhead, put in the student handbook, all that)    From the Desk of Marvin O. Koenig:    Dances at Walnut Hills High School have been fun and enjoyable for students and chaperones alike for years and should continue as enjoyable events for all.  Some of what is seen and heard in moveies, on television, and radio is not acceptable at hight school functions.  Students usually understand this and exercise modesty and good taste in dress and behavior.  Provocative dress and lewd dancing are not acceptable.   Grinding, bumping, fondling, humping, licking, booty dancing, rolling, kicking, mashing, shoving, wallowing, disrobing, sexual kissing, freaking, jacking,  and additionally whatever a chaperone deems improper and/or indecent will not be permitted.  Social behavior at a dance should be courteous, polite, and mannerly with one another, chaperones, and concession workers.  Each person represents himself/herself as well as Walnut Hills High School.  All school rules, including possession or use of alcohol, apply and  exceptional behavior  is anticipated on the part of each person.  As difficult or unpleasant as it may be for chaperones, they will require students and guests to leave who do not meet expectations and guidelines for attending a high school dance.  Further, I understand I will be subject to the Cincinnati Public Schools Code of Suspension, Expulsion, and Removal....   Unacceptable Apparel-   Mask or costume (unless a costume ball), sleep wear, boots other than dress/fashion boots, work-type shoes/boots, work uniforms, or painting pants, exposed lingerie, tank top, undershirt, t-shirt, or sports bra, jeans with frayed holes, slogans, or unclean, sweatshirt, sweatsuit, or jogging clothes, bare midriff outfits, "urban" wear/fatigues, see-through dress without an undershell or lining, plunging neckline, beach, or swimwear.

        OOO... Pills!     Song in head:  Just a Phase - Incubus  Current Mood:  Sick  Before you get any ideas... DB is the one who said the subject line... Not I... All I did was take some tylenol during his class.  However, I'm currently entertained by a large amount of "CDT's" as John would say... Current Deep Thoughts, that is.  I suppose that the prevailing ones are a bit leftover from yesterday... I logged on to write, then went to watch Law & Order, and fell asleep after five minutes.  Still, though, why is it that so many people remain involved in ventures in which they have limited influence and questionable influence?  It's quite puzzling... If there was some payoff, or the likelihood of a potential payoff, maybe this would make sense.  However, in most of these situations, no such reward exists.  Thus, what the hell makes us stay?  YAC is a perfect example.  I go there two Wednesdays out of every month, wasting a good four hours of my life every month that I really would appreciate having.  I walk into the classroom hallway, always on time, and get pissed because none of the coordinators  ever  have us high enough on their priority list to come on time.  Of course, I can't blame them.  We get nothing done, and if I were them, I would walk out with a headache every time also.  (But see, they at least get paid for their time, or get to flex it out, so they have a reward involved).  I used to consider it a learning experience, but unless I'm learning to argue and knitpick over useless issues, then I'm not learning anything.  It looks good on a resume, sure... But I've already served two terms, so it will be on there whether I stay in it or not...  I walk in, and feel as if I have to watch what I say, so usually end up saying nothing at all (and also because what I have to say never gets listened to anyhow).  I have to deal with Kate Agnew, which isn't so much annoying as it is... just awkward.  You usually try to avoid people who you tell to never talk to you again or you'll call the police.  We don't even have youth facilitators anymore, so I have to stare Kim or Arden in the face the whole time (or, on rare occasions, Kristen--Don sits in the back on the laptop or doesn't come at all... Why?)  You see... they have all come to the realization that this is a pretty-much useless council that is counterproductive and a waste of time.  Thus, they don't give it too much.  Again, I don't blame them... but I can always go back to the philosophy of the almighty "founder" of the CHM Youth Team, Mr. Scott Shipp... "WIIFM?"  He had signs and everything... So... what the fuck is in it for me, eh?  NOTHING!!  But yet, I stay... Yet, I still come every two weeks... I go out of my way, ride the bus down there, arrive an hour and a quarter early, have to depend on someone else to give me a ride home... and I get what out of this hassle?  A raise?  No.  Flex time?  No.  More hours?  No.  New opportunities?  No.  A good time?  I can probably count those on one hand... actually, I probably don't even need that... maybe a thumb just in case.    Anyhow, I rant... But it seems like so many things in my life are worthless pursuits of a similar degree.  In other words, I wake up every morning, just to get the day over with, so I can see tomorrow, and repeat the cycle again.  That seems very worthwhile... Of course, I know that I have that bright future... but that doesn't help me now.  In about 5 years, I'll get out of college.  Another 5 years, maybe I'll get married.  5 years later, go to Grad School.  5 years later, mid-life crisis.  5 years later, lose money in the market or get laid off, so end up some sort of Economics professor at a small-time university or high school... That's not a worst-case scenario, but a mediocre one... it doesn't demand too much luck or anything like that.  It's one that I would be okay with, I suppose... Enough!  Well, now that I've successfully made myself sound even more depressed than I did before, I'll continue listening to my most recently illegally downloaded music, and maybe come across some plans for the weekend... maybe at least working out my schedule for spring break, since I won't be going on any trips.  I would go into work, but working only Sunday and Monday would look suspicious... I'd have to throw in one day from a Tues-Sat, and I don't really wanna do that.  Ken will put me in FP, and Kristen will go biotch on me, and Lee will piss me off with that explosive flatulence that is his brain... Oye.  Oh yeah... almost forgot.  I need to decide whether or not to go to MORP... I have until tomorrow to scrounge $7.00 for a ticket... and it's coming up soon.  Chase said I should come, but Chase knows little... except that he and I can build the meanest circuit Walnut has ever seen!   Damn, everything really is physics... I must start shopping for a life... Got an A in Meteoro though... it works.  "7 AM, the garbage truck beeps as it backs up and I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away.  Could I push rewind?  All the credits strewn in signifying the end but I missed the best part.  Could we please go back to the start? Forgive my indecision..."  --Incubus, "11 AM"

        What'll It Be For Ya This Time?     Song in head:  Whatever the fuck was on KISS107 when I got out of the car  Current Mood:  Too hyper to care  Well, for a snow day, today was rather disappointing.  I did, at least, get to keep the car, and there are a few amusing anecdotes to go along with the whole wintery death fiasco... But, like I said, mostly a bust.  I did get to keep the car, which made me feel better, despite the fact that Chris and I didn't go anywhere.  That Accord that we looked at... well, Mom decided to buy it after all.  OOPS!!!  Too late!  It was sold!  (I can't listen to my son... he may know the blue-book value off the top of his head, but what can he know about cars?)  He he he...  However, the whole day was not a drag.  I went with Mr. MacG, meeting him off Glendale-Milford so he could drop off the van for his dad, then went to Subway in Deer Park.  Had an interesting conversation, then hit the Starbucks in Kenwood, because Deer Park sucks mondo ass.  It's like Cheviot, but on the east side, and surrounded by rich hoods.  This is where the fun starts... So I pull into Starbucks, and see the blue van in the lot, so I know that Matt is working.  Thus, John and I drank  almost  on the house.  (I had to pay $1.00 for mine... but I'll get to that).  Well, long story short, after a bit of harassment and reminder about that pot or six of quad-strength coffee on Friday night, Matt wouldn't let me escape with just a cup of coffee... no siree bob.  Nor would he let me escape with just a Venti Latte... Oh hell no...  So you say "GET ON WITH IT!!  WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU HAVE TO DRINK?!?"  Okay, I'll tell you... I mean, I don't know what the big deal is about a six-shot venti latte with Irish Creme in honor of St. Patrick... He he he...   I was just a wee bit off me rocker.  However, I haven't had that much fun since... since... since... since... since... oh yeah!  I remember!  (Too bad you'll sit pondering forever!  FOREVER!!  Bwa ha ha)  I look at it this way, if my kidneys are gonna fail when I'm 40, then I may as well enjoy as much of this crap now while I can still stand it!  (*cackles*)  My God, I was laughing it up... I'm still pretty wired, but not nearly so bad as then.  It's just what the doctor ordered, goddamnit!  Bwa ha ha ha...   Nonetheless, they actually marked the cup, so now it hangs on my wall as a souvenir... I did find a new favorite beverage, but I can only consume them on special occasions.  For two reasons:  1)  If I make such items a part of my regular diet, I'll have a heart attack before I'm 25, and 2) Try figuring out what a six-shot venti latte with Irish Creme costs... That's right...  $5.90!!!   (Of course, I had the hookup, so he charged me for a kid's milk, which comes to a whopping $1.00)  Nonetheless, $6 for a 20oz coffee based drink... a tad on the expensive side... but worth it every now and then.    So, I'm off to tweak me resume, so I can hand it in with the Washington DC app at the YAC meeting tomorrow, then to finish me Notecards set D-1, and then, maybe some sleep.  IDK... I got a lot of sleep today.  Tack this coffee... Hell, I'm not driving tomorrow... why the hell not?  *evil, maniacal laughter*  134 out of 480 minutes used in the month of February... Damn son... and that's a low estimate!    Well, I have no scanner to put in these Dilbert cartoons... but the text is still good:  Mgr:  Our CEO will visit here next week.  You all know what to do. Dilbert:  We should stop all productive work and create overhead transparencies that exaggerate our value. Mgr:  And a few of our uglier co-workers will be replaced by actors.  Mgr:  Have you summarized your accomplishments for our CEO? Dilbert:  Almost done.  Okay--My body converts toxic wast into penicillin, I'm clairvoyant, and I invented wool. Mgr:  I thought sheep invented wool. Dilbert:  Who are you going to believe, them or me?  Mgr:  Our CEO canceled his visit.  He's sending his top aid, Zimbu the Monkey, in his place. Dilbert:  Isn't that typical?  I spent a week exaggerating my accomplishments for this.  Now he sends a stupid monkey! Dilbert:  What could be more humiliating than sucking up to a monkey? Monkey (standing behind Dilbert):  Failing at it?

        Never You Mind...     Song in head:  "The New Deal" - My WMP Playlist  Current Mood:  Indifferent  "Nobody knows it, but you've got a secret smile, and you use it only for me." - Semisonic, "Secret Smile"  Today was... a day... like most others... boring... simple... lifeless... uneventful... semi-stressful.... Bah.    English:  Find out once again that Thomas has no idea what the fuck he is going to do about our grades.  *shrugs*  If I fail, I'll appeal.  If not, oh well.  German:  Frau is useless.  Physics:  Resistors in Series and Parallel Circuits.  Current remains the same throughout the system, thus causing a change in resistance and electric potential varying upon the path and resistors interfered.    Office:  Fetched a dozen kids who skipped DTs to come to the office to get their due punishments.  Didn't talk to a single kid except to say "Take this paper to Ms. Rhodes in Office 227."  However, talked to every single teacher, some at length, about anything and nothing.  Why do I get along so well with adults?  "This is the story of a girl who cried a river and drowned the whole world; and while she looked so sad in photographs, I absolutely love her, when she smiles."  -Nine Days, "Absolutely (Story of a Girl)"  Meteorology:  There are two types of telescopes:  Refractive (using lenses) and Reflective (using mirrors).  All have four objectives:  gather light, bring the light to a focus, Generate an image, and Magnify that image.    PreCalculus:  Well, we aren't gonna go to the computer lab, because I, Debbie King, am a moron.  Instead, we'll have a free day.  Also, we're beginning a project where we get to create a math newspaper.  Groups of three.  Mr. Joe over here happens to get stuck with Jenny Rice and Ware Carollton-Ford... who happen to be a couple... a well-publicized one.  Jenny is quite flighty... and Ware is a guy who is whipped.  Also, Ware likes to take off his shoes in class... and his socks.  And, although I'm not a foot-loving man, his feet are ugly... it makes me want to puke....  Thus, we got nothing done.  The happy pair chatted it up while the third wheel tried to play along until he said "Fuck you" and went back to his seat to play calculator games.  Being Third Wheel sucks.  "Living easy, living free, season ticket on a one-way ride."  -AC/DC, "Highway to Hell"  APUS:  Got the last of Q3 papers back, including grade sheets.  73.9, baby!  That's right, I pulled off a C somehow, no curve required (as if there was one).  My rank:  #59 (of 69 students).  It's okay... I did just fine... relatively... or not... SHUT UP!  "Before the rising sun, we fly, so many roads to choose, we start off walking and learn to run."  -The Carepenters, "We've Only Just Begun"  Bus:  It dawned on me that I'm going to be a SENIOR in about two months... How gleeful...  Home:  Mom called about the car I looked at briefly yesterday.  Fred picked me up and we test drove it.  It's an excellent car, blue booked around $4100, giving it average condition (when really it's considered clean:  $5650) and the guy only wanted $2700 OBO... we talked him down to 25... but mom doesn't want to pay.  92 Accord?  112K?  Come on, now...  Nissan:  Stopped at Starbucks.  "I'm glad you have high goals, Joseph."  "Why, because I drink coffee from Starbucks, and know Hondas and the roads in Kenwood?"    Nissan:  So... about that trip to Chicago... "Uh... NO."  "Why not?"  "Just because."    Nissan:  "I have to stop by the bank... do you want to run in?"  "No, not really."  "Well, I have a headache.  Can you do it as a favor."  (*how did I know that was coming?*)  "Suuuuuure."  Nissan:  "What do you want to eat?"  "Real food... no bullshit."  Where do we go?  Taco Bell.  *puke*  Get to the window... "$13.21, Sir."  "Uh... we forgot to stop by the ATM."  *drives to ATM, comes back to Taco Hell*  "You're such a sweetheart, Joseph.  Thanks for being patient with me this evening."  "Eh."  "I'm serious.  I know it's hard."  "Eh."  "Why aren't you in a good mood anymore?"  "Eh."  "I'm sorry."  "Eh."  "Why won't you tell me what's wrong?"  "Eh."  "I'm so tired of being here, suppressed by all my childish fears.  If you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave, 'cause your presence still lingers here, and it won't leave me alone.  These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real, there's just too much that time cannot erase.  When you cry, I wipe away all of your tears.  When you scream, I fight away all of your fears.  And I held your hand through all of these years, but you still have all of me."  -Evanescence, "Fallen"  Sometimes, just when you're ready to throw it in the ditch and leave it for the buzzards, you realize that it's useful.  Distorted pork... what a novel idea.  Four paces ahead... that is a sucky mantra.  "All I can taste is this moment, and all I can breathe is your life, and sooner or later it's over, I just don't wanna miss you tonight."  -Goo Goo Dolls, "Iris"  "There's a port on a western bay and it serves a hundred ships a day.  Lonely sailors pass the time away and talk about their homes.  And there's a girl in this harbor town and she works laying whiskey down.  They say "Brandy, fetch another round."  She serves them whiskey and wine.  Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be.  Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea."  -Looking Glass, "Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)"  I'm done... like blackened toast.

        Fifteen for a Moment...     Song in head:  Five for Fighting - 100 Years  Current Mood:  Happy  I feel like I have to write something, but I don't really feel like updating right now...  So, here I go:  "Something."   I will say one thing:  I think that this is the most powerful song that I have ever heard.  If not, at least in the top five.   I'm fifteen for a moment Caught in between ten or twenty  And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are  I'm twenty-two for a moment And she feels better than ever And we're on fire Making our way back from Mars  15 there's still time for you Time to buy and time to lose 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live   I'm 33 for a moment Still the man, but you see I'm a they A kid on the way A family on my mind   I'm 45 for a moment The sea is high And I'm heading into a crisis Chasing the years of my life   15 there's still time for you Time to buy, Time to lose yourself Within a morning star  15, I'm all right with you 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live   Half time goes by Suddenly you’re wise Another blink of an eye 67 is gone The sun is getting high We're moving on...   I'm 99 for a moment Dying for just another moment And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are   15 there's still time for you 22 I feel her too 33 you’re on your way Every day's a new day...   15 there's still time for you Time to buy and time to choose Hey 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live

        And So It Goes...     Song in head:  Save the Population - RHCP  Current Mood:  Pissed Off, but somehow Content...  BoeseGeschichte: this is merely something to do BoeseGeschichte: I don't expect much of anybody anymore... BoeseGeschichte: the world is filled with... people BoeseGeschichte: and they all look out for #1 BoeseGeschichte: and i don't blame them lostgenius05: yeah BoeseGeschichte: but at the same time... BoeseGeschichte: I don't expect much else BoeseGeschichte: no no big deal lostgenius05: joe lostgenius05: you're insultng me lostgenius05: im serious lostgenius05: stop lostgenius05: im sorry i am not able to entertainm you BoeseGeschichte: waht? BoeseGeschichte: I'm not insulting you... lostgenius05: how would you know lostgenius05: you're not the one feeling insulted BoeseGeschichte: i'm simply making overly simple generalizations about the world... BoeseGeschichte: well... apparently i'm the one dishing it out... BoeseGeschichte: that wasn't my intent BoeseGeschichte: I'm just pulling stuff out of my ass BoeseGeschichte: because I'm bored lostgenius05: i know  I don't know what the fuck I'm feeling.  I went back earlier and looked at some old journal and blog entries, which was interesting.  Kinda takes you back... takes you back to stuff you remember, times that were simpler, yadda yadda yadda.  Recently, I've been doing a lot of thinking about who's on my list of people that I care about, and who isn't, and whose list(s) I am on... I really don't know with a couple.  Others are fairly obvious.  The hardest part of it all is to know that, for me at least, the network of important beings is relatively small, numbering around five.  I also realized that there's an even smaller list of people who know that they're on the list--in other words, I'm back to the same ole, same ole of not expressing my feelings well, or whatever the hell mom says.    I know it sounds stupid, but in many ways I just wish that I was in fifth grade again... Life was so much simpler.  (Of course, from what I hear, my life is running ahead of schedule by a few years, so my issues then were likely at par with that of today's "normal" teen, and the problems I have now are about at par with someone getting out of college).  Nonetheless, in so many ways, I feel... robbed.   My mind knows where I need to go, what I need to do, and almost always will give me the right answer to any question I have.  However, my heart and my gut tell me other stuff.  It really scares me that I'm beginning to lose my sense of direction... All of a sudden, I just don't care.    Maybe I'm regressing... coming back down to earth.  But that just doesn't work.  It's like the guy who got locked up when he was 17, and didn't get out for 10 years, even though he was wrongfully convicted.  He was almost 30, and didn't know how to write a check.  By regressing now, I'll lose the biggest part of my appeal to the real world--my maturity--and then be thrown back in a pace behind instead of a mile ahead... *shudders*  Too much thought on a stupid topic.  I suppose it's like the AIM convo...  I'm at the point where I dont' expect much of anything from anyone.  Every new person you encounter is to be treated equally and nicely, but at the same time, they are stupid, moronic, mean, cold, heartless, fake, prejudiced, simple, or bad until proven otherwise.  They just hide it.  If it is proven otherwise though, and on enough aspects, then they make it onto the list of people who've earned my respect.  Sadly enough, that list is small too... the people on the like list are generally on the respect list, for some reason.  Also, it's quite surprising to see who's on them.  However, at the same time, there isn't a single person on the planet with whom I have shared that sliver of the pie.  Oddly enough, that makes me happy, knowing that no one really knows me.  Then again, it reminds me of another problem altogether, one which I shall not delve into at said time or environment.  Maybe if I was an open book, then life would be simpler.  Maybe if there were no hurdles to jump over or lines to cross.  Bah.  I'll be who I am, because even if I die a lonely man, I can say at least I had me.  Plus, I may as well be me, because everyone else is stupid, moronic, mean, cold, heartless, fake, prejudiced, simple, or bad until proven otherwise, right?  Somebody stop him before they call the feds...   I can see by your eyes, you must be lying, when you think I don't have a clue.  Baby, you're crazy, if you think that you can fool me, because I've seen that movie too....  The one where the players are acting surprised, saying love's just a four-letter word, between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes, while thier actions become so observed...  So keep your auditions for somebody who hasn't got that much to lose, 'cause you can tell by the lines I've decided, that I've seen that movie too.

        Okay, that works...     Song in head:  Amazing Grace  Current Mood:  Slaphappy/Really Drained/Winding Down  Today was a fun day off.  More details available upon request, but YHN is going to sleep now, I reckon.  It's kinda sad when you can't stand to breathe in the air present in your own house.  There's a reason I live in the basement.  Chicago?  Maybe if I had a parent with a head on straight.  Tonight's Quote:  "That would be way too enjoyable... I can't believe I just said that out loud."  Is everything a baited hook?  And are there locks on our doors?  If you're looking for an open book, look no further, I am yours.  We'll behave like animals, swing from tree to tree, we can do anything that turns you on and sets you free.  You're an exception to the rule, you're of an unthought rarity, you're all I ever wanted, southern girl, could you want me?  What's the point?

        That's interesting...     Song in head:  Drive - Incubus  Current Mood:  Slaphappy   Interesting Results of this evening's little excursion:   That construction on Miami Ave. isn't all that bad if you take all of the other cars out of the equation... Well, at least until you realize that they closed off Euclid... then you get pissed.    The UDF at the corner of US50 and Indian Hill Dr. doesn't have a bathroom, and closes at 1 AM, go figure.  Dogs run across Drake Road way too often... deer as well!  Trucks aren't permitted on Columbia Parkway.  Ronald Regan Cross Co Hwy (SR126) has a very narrow shoulder in most sections, and most of the street lamps don't work.  It is very difficult to go exactly 35 MPH on Rybolt Road.  The ramp from Eggleston to EB Columbia Pkwy. will be closing on March 15.  The Indian Hill Rangers may not be quite so useless as their rep suggests... they can be annoying too.  There is a concrete island in the parking lot of Indian Hill High School.  Garfield Ave. is quite the treacherous little street.  Who would figure that an 87 Stanza with a stuck lifter could go 0-60 in about 4.3 seconds.  I-75 is way too boring for my tastes.  Regan to 275 to 74 to Rybolt to Bridgetown to Robb to Applegate is definitely a longer way home.  There is no interchange to get on EB US50 from SB I-71.  There are four horse crossings on Shawnee Run Dr.   EB Regan Hwy. dead-ends into Montgomery Road... and SR 126 continues... somewhere.  Only an idiot would park his car on the shoulder of the Kenwood Rd. exit ramp from 126... right behind another car.  A 20 oz. coffee from UDF, without your own mug, costs $1.09, and comes complete with a free supply of International Delight creamers, including Hazelnut, Amaretto, French Vanilla, and Irish Creme.  You really have no idea what a wonderful feeling it is to, all of the sudden, realize that your holiday that you thought you had been robbed of, was finally granted to you... but you find out at 2330 the night before.  This party is old and uninviting, participants all in black and white, we enter in full-blown technicolor, nothing is the same after tonight.  If the world would fall apart, in a fiction worthy of wind, I wouldn't change a thing now that you're here!  Your love is a verve, here in my room, here in my room, here in my room.    You enter and close the door behind you, Now show me the world seen from the stars, if only the lights would dim a little, I'm weary of eyes upon my scars.  Pink tractor beam into your incision, I came here expecting next to nothing, so thank you for being that kind of girl, kind of girl, kind of girl....

        I've finally decided my future lies...     Song in head:  Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - Elton John  Current Mood:  I don't know  When are you gonna come down, when are you going to land?  I should have stayed on the farm, I should have listened to my old man...  Today was an interesting day.  Found out that that one on the prospect list who I've been waffling about the past week or so--she's a devout Christian, complete with Study Bible.  He he he...  Mr. Thomas (the new English teacher) said that he has no idea how he will do our grades, because Coffman has dropped off the planet, and taken his gradebook with him.  Thus, we have nothing... NOTHING for all of third quarter, except the midterm grades, which are just letters.  Went to German and got a 101 on the test from yesterday (the one where I thought I may have gotten a relatively low 95).  Got a quiz back... it was a 100, but she owes me 5 points... she didn't give me the class-wide curve... Fucking dyke.  In return, I didn't do my work all bell, and chose to goof off with Bedinghaus and Khinke, who sit next to me... We pretty much spent the whole time writing strange shit in our books, and shot the homework to hell.  Got a 67% for the quarter in DB's Physics class... which is the most solid B you can get (B range is 50-74) and above the 64% class median.  Meteoro... I don't know... prob. a B, unfortunately, but maybe an A if he curves.  Escaped PreCal this qtr with an 87.5--not too shabby.  History... my whole grade rides on the test and makeup assignment from today.  I don't know.  I don't think I'll have any fingernails left come Monday, though.  (It's a C/D border... I know... what a course to fail, eh?)    You know you can't hold me forever, I didn't sign up with you, I'm not a present for your friends to open, This boy's too young to be singing the blues...  So I rode the bus down to the museum.  Got in, showed Donny how to get there (he stopped by to drop off some papers or something.)  Went up to the office, then changed into the uniform and combed my hair (which had looked like total shit--unnaceptable for the workplace in my opinion) and helped sort out a paperwork issue... (Wherein Jen Tilford took revenge on all those instances of me suggesting her fat-bitchness by not unlocking the office door for us).  Went down to South Gallery to discuss the 1940s LHW coming up in June (they're including me in on some of the prospecting, which I'm glad about).  Tried to help with some PreCal homework that involved Statistics, and I had no idea what I was doing, which kinda made the two of us.  Went to get some real food, and the rush hour traffic kinda made that go snafu, so I picked up the most disgusting sandwich I think I've ever eaten from a Wendy's.  Oh well, the fries were good.    So goodbye yellow brick road, where the dogs of society howl, you can't plant me in your penhouse, I'm going back to my plough, back to the howling old owl in the woods, hunting the horny black toad...  So Sandy, Kathleen, and I got started for the evening event.  Apparently, nobody happened to inform me that the 100 person contract had been reduced to a mere 17.  17.  So Sandy was in FP on the Landing most of the time, and so were all the guests.  Nothing to do, not even a point in walking through.  So I hung out in machine tools with Kathleen the whole time, and we had a nice chat to pass the time.  At least they all left around 2130, instead of riding out the 2300 as in the contract.  I got some Godiva Chocolates out of the deal and will still get my money, so all is good.  So then the three of us piled into the two-door Honda and went to our respective places of residence.  I won the p'diddle game, as usual, by two points.    Oh, I've finally decided my future lies beyond the yellow brick road...  So I walked into the house, and the mother was asleep, which was a relief.  I really just wanted to walk in, and go straight to my room, turn on the music and unwind after a 16-hour day, and I knew that if she was awake that she was going to be like.. "OH NO!  He's pissed off."  *sigh*  Nonetheless, I did go down into my room and am chilling, but now I want to leave again, because I have tomorrow off.  Blah.  What do you think you'll do then, I have to shoot down the plane;  it will take you a couple of vodka and tonics to set you on your feet again...  So, all in all, tonight and preceding day were pretty good, I reckon.  However, I'm not sure.  There's plenty that I be confused about on a daily basis... not just new, little things, but continual, big things, also.  Here goes that silly mind again...  There's a Cheers episode that has a similar theme to the problem... that was intriguing.  Cheers is such a good show... *praises Nick at Nite*  Now there's a good theme song--Phish... *is rambling to avoid making a point--so predictable if you know what to look for*  Maybe you'll get a replacement, there's plenty like me to be found, mongrels who aint got a penny, sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground...  Nonetheless, however, I think I'm gonna go grab some coffee...  Alone, but still.  I will enjoy, and hopefully you will too.  So goodbye yellow brick road, where the dogs of society howl, you can't plant me in your penthouse, I'm going back to my plough, back to the howling old owl in the woods, hunting the horny black toad... Oh, I've finally decided my future lies, beyond the yellow brick road!

        Why Do I Bother?     Song in head:  I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For - U2  Current Mood:  Depressed  After a killer weekend, I return to reality, with pictorial grocery lists, and no ambition, in a house straight from hell.  Sometimes, it feels like... Why do I bother?  In the words of John, while working at Wendy's:  "What for ya?"  519960000-71922811  I have climbed the highest mountains,  I have run through the fields Only to be with you,  Only to be with you. I have run, I have crawled I have scaled these city walls, These city walls,  Only to be with you But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.  I have kissed honey lips Felt the healing in her fingertips It burned like fire This burning desire I have spoke the tongue of angels I have held the hand of a devil It was warm in the night I was cold as a stone But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.  I believe in the kingdom come Then all the colors will bleed into one, bleed into one But yes, I'm still running. You broke the bonds and you Loosed the chains Carried the cross of my shame, of my shame You know I believe it But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

        A Sharp Contrast...     Song in head:  WARM 98 Jazz Saturday Night  Current Mood:  Pleased  In examining my blog editing page, I realize that my last post was on Thursday.  However, much has happened since then, of course.  Overall, at the moment, I am pretty pleased with the current situation.  Nonetheless, perhaps I should delve into greater detail, my friends, for YHN may need to update the wonderful world of his antics.  So Friday came yesterday.  School was rather boring.  Caught the bus to downtown, then walked my 20 blocks to Habitat.  Luckily, Jan was able to give me a ride home, since she lives on the west side of town anyhow.  This was nice, considering the rain.  We had a nice chat on the way home too... I never really knew her very well, and it's nice to have a little more background on some of her life.  I had bits and pieces which seem to now fall together more securely now.   So I was at home for a little while, then I went out to dinner with James, the big brother from the Big Bros/Big Sisters Program.  (That was a post-blog development on Thursday--calling him up after such a long time).  The dinner was good, and I was more than happy to catch up with him.  I felt like shit for a lot of the time for sloughing off his phone calls and being a jerk, but that was due to me.  I had a nice time in spite.    Then, I met Johnny boy for coffee up at Starbucks briefly.  Had a fun time there, and got pumped with caffeine for the impending journey.  I was to meet Micah at his church for an outing to LaserWeb, where we would play laser tag all night long until 0600hrs.  This was an event that I didn't have much fun at last year, but that I was strangely looking forward to this year.  I had an excellent time though, because I was so hyper and chilled-out and what not.  It was strangely odd to be swearing so much in front of the ppl in my car though.  (I happened to get the only car load of actually devout Christians that they have in the whole youth group.)  However, we all went to Laser Web, and I had a good time.  Also, I got out of having to pay the $15 fee by mingling in with the crowd.  He he he...  So I had some $$$ to play the video games, including the Dance Dance Revolution machine, which has to be the funnest arcade game since Pac-Man.    Nonetheless, Scalf was beasting it up in the laser tag, pulling off ranks of 2nd, 3rd, and 5th in the 3 games I played, out of about 24 players.  :-D  Micah was pissed though, because I consistently beat him.  *shakes head*  However, at a couple points, this little church outing got out of hand, like when they started to pass the fattie in one of the party rooms, and there was some macking going on in some other places too.  Hence, I cut out early at 0330, putting me home around 0400, and sleeping finally around 0500.   I woke up at 0730, said "Fuck this" despite being wide awake, and went back to bed until 1300.  Woke up and got a shower, then did mom's taxes on the internet.  Which, long story short, led to a humongous argument about her intelligence that she entirely started herself.  I wasn't in the mood, so I promptly finished it.  However, I put in the order for her $3000 or whatever refund, which should be direct deposited within 6-10 days.  :-D  (The sooner she gets it, the sooner I get to drive to school again).    Thus, I left the house around 1600 and ended up... guess where?  KENWOOD!   Just like EVERY SINGLE TIME I leave the house it seems.  So, as I'm walking into the Madeira Krogers to get some Vernor's, I get a text from Kathleen, and then a phone call.  So I swung by her house and hung out for a while.  Mr. Kennedy ordered pizza, and referred to his wife as "Mrs. Kennedy" instead of "Tricia," which struck me as highly awkward for some reason.    But, after dinner, fixing pop-up ads, and being complimented on my weight-loss, Kathleen and I went on down to Jack Quinn's in Covington (not Newport), for a benefit concert to which we were both invited, but by separate people.  After we finally tracked down the place, we had a lot of fun there, but left around 2130, and drove around until about 2300.    And, hence today was a "sharp contrast."  Here, it started off like shit, and out there, in the world, it went great.  *shrugs*  At least I ended with the good news.   And tomorrow... work at the museum.  That should be fun.  Then, dinner at Kathy's (in KENWOOD) like nearly every Sunday.  I have homework to do, but it should get done at work tomorrow.  He he he.  I had a real weekend... and it's such an oddity to have a weekend jam-packed with improptu stuff that I had something going on every day... Wow... That's another sharp contrast for ya.    It can't go on the wall, but this is the best I can do:  "If I ever meet someone who can bullshit as well as I can, I'm screwed."

        You Make Me Sick...     Song in head:  Highway to Hell - AC/DC  Current Mood:  Irritated  Okay, so today was a normal school day.  Had a Physics test, but no biggie.  I think I did okay on it.  Classes were nothing excessive of normal, otherwise.  Nothing exciting, yadda yadda.  However, at 1430, Mom and I met with Ms. Grayman, the Guidance Counselor, about my college plans.  This was kind of a good thing.  Grayman complimented my transcript, GPA, and PSAT scores.  Told me to register to take the standardized tests, gave me a couple college possibililities, etc.  Standard junk.  Mom was "expecting something different," though... and was disappointed.  *shakes head*  So then mom and I went to the Kenwood Mall to eat some lunch, where we had a highly annoying discussion.  We got in the car and drove around for a little while, and continued or highly annoying discussion.    Then went to pick up Christena, continuing our highly annoying discussion.  Drove home, continuing the highly annoying discussion.    At one point, I actually said to her "You make me sick."  I wasn't joking, I was dead serious.  I was downright sick of all the bullshit she was putting on the table.  Also, to add to the highly annoying discussion, we were in Kenwood, right?  Well, Mom, being the fat little bitch she is, decides that every time she sees someone driving a car with a value greater than $30K, then she sticks out her tongue and says "Oooooo.... Fancy automobile, Mr. High-and-mighty!!"  Okay, this wasn't funny the first time, it still isn't.  It continued not being funny, including the fortieth time she said it.  I was ready to rip her limb from limb... but remaining the calm man I am... Simply took the smart, hard-hitting statement... "You make me sick."  Also, she says to me while we're sitting in traffic, "Guess what?  I just found out that Christena is also off on Friday, March 12.  What do you think about that?"  If you could have seen how fast the smile left my face, and went off into the abyss.  You see, March 12 was my holiday.  MY fucking day off.  MINE, DAMNIT!!!  MY inservice day at MY school, and MY day to do whatever the hell I fucking please!!!  As Dean puts it so eloquently, "Arrrrrrr!"    So I got my tax return checks today.  My whopping $18.10 from Federal and my $10 from Ohio.  Kentucky sent me their $6.00 some time ago.  So now I feel... like wow.  That was nice.  However, not enough to outweigh the constant annoyingness that was implanted by the mother.  Just enough to move me from "enraged" to "irritated."  Living easy, living free Season ticket on a one-way ride Asking nothing, leave me be Taking everything in my stride Don't need reason, don't need rhyme Ain't nothing I would rather do Going down, party time My friends are gonna be there too  I'm on the highway to hell  No stop signs, speed limit Nobody's gonna slow me down Like a wheel, gonna spin it Nobody's gonna mess me round Hey Satan, payin' my dues Playing in a rocking band Hey Momma, look at me I'm on my way to the promised land  I'm on the highway to hell (Don't stop me)  And I'm going down, all the way down I'm on the highway to hell

        Sometimes I Wonder...     Song in head:  We've Only Just Begun - The Carpenters  Current Mood:  Unsure  Sometimes I wonder... what it is that is my place around here, or anywhere.  I had a pretty good day, despite its length, stretching from 0620 to 2200.  But at the same time, I look about, and see this and see that, and I just have to sit back and wonder.    Granted, mine is quite a foggy mind, with all sorts of silliness scurrying about from point to point.  Nonetheless, it becomes quite puzzling to Your Humble Narrator, my friends, what the purpose of all the hooplah is.  From my new English teacher, to hating German for all the wrong reasons, to being with DB more than anybody else (that's the scariest part, I think), to showing up Ms. King, to getting a 3 on the DBQ, to my lack of an automobile, to my lack of funds, to my lack of real job, to my family, to my real friends, to my acquaintances, to those who think they're my friends, to all these silly people hanging about me, to crushed dreams, to shattered promises, to welched bets, to deciding where to go for college, to inequity upon every horizon, to listening to my music, to... to everything...   Yet, whenever I wonder, I think of certain good things that I know are the core principles to life.  Love, companionship, friendship, happiness, yadda yadda yadda...  There are certainly the good times, and certainly the bad times.  However, somehow, we always come through it all, maybe not unscathed, but we come through... For every time that I think it can't be any worse, I come to the realization that, oh, yes it can, bizitch.  It just gets hard sometimes.  Few know what it is like to feel like you've got it so rough, and to look around and see just how many people had everything handed to them on a silver platter (or at least handed to them, or hell, thrown at them).  The point is--they didn't have to work nearly so hard for it as you did.  That hurts sometimes.  You begin to wonder, why was it that I came in how I did, and they didn't?  Furthermore, the strangest part, and quite the $64,000 question, is why the hell am I rising above the filth and drudge of this hole?  Why aren't I some drug addict, or an alcoholic, or whatever?  Why do I have taste, as opposed to the rest of my family, who "envies my lifestyle?"  Why do I know how to read, and enjoy it, as opposed to these stupid yayhoos who spawned me, who, mostly, didn't graduate high school, and couldn't tell you the difference between desert and dessert unless it was in picture form?  These are the things that I wonder about... mainly focused on myself.  Why me?  What am I here for?  Why is that?  How can I fulfill my potential?    This may seem selfish, but if I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing, then what the hell can I do, eh?  I used to think that I was here to make others happy.  I gave that shit up, that's for sure.  But still... I wonder.  I keep on wondering... and yes, damnit, it IS worth it.    So I'm in this pissy/ugly/angry/happy/hyper/loving mood... I don't know if it's lack of food, presence of alcohol, or resent of my family.  This kinda sucks.  "We've only just begun, To live, White lace and promises, A kiss for luck and we're on our way... (We've only begun) Before the rising sun, We fly, So many roads to choose, We start off walking and learn to run... And when the evening comes, We smile, So much in life ahead, We'll find a place where there's room to grow"

        What the Hell, Jimbo?     Song in head:  Time of Your Life - Green Day  Current Mood:  Working  Okay, so I'm working at an evening event tonight in order to pick up a malenky bit of extra dough.  Came here straight after school, around 1515, and will be here until 2115 tonight.  Jason bought me ice cream, god love him, and I jested about the old lady ticket-taker who has a crush on him.  So sad... But Sandy is in charge here tonight, so things should go pretty well.  However, the kiosk has no idea who the liason is going to be tonight, which should cause some sort of problems to arise.  It's not looking promising.    So Kate sent me an IM today... I'm not sure what to make of that.  She apologized for her meanness during our argument.  (What meanness? - that was my response)  However, I go about life.  Like my mother, it will be a grain of salt on the great, 60 oz. pepper steak of life.    Speaking of ignorance, I had an interesting chat with Kristen today.  That was... well, it explained a lot.  She spoke of how she cruised through school without doing jack, and told of how you don't need to do anything really.  It took every ounce of tongue-biting strength to keep from saying "It shows" and "That's OU for ya."  LMAO.  Talk about pink slip--that would've been it.    But the Palm Pilot will continue to loop these songs... because Time of Your Life, which was on when I logged in about 45 minutes ago, is back on again.  Good song, that one is, real horrorshow.  Speaking of NADSAT, I finished that book.  It was really good, but now I have nothing to read because I forgot my other book at home.    Anyhow... the guests are now entering, so until later....  "You got any fried chicken?" "Best damn chicken in the state." "I'll take four fried chickens and a coke." "You want chicken wings or chicken legs?" " Four fried chickens  and a coke." "And some dry white toast please." "Hold on a minute..."

        So I Call You on the Tin Can Phone...     Song in head:  Sick Sad Little World - Incubus  Current Mood:  Tired  Well, I've been brief, and it looks like I will continue to be now.  *snaps*  Read on the bus on the way to school this morning.  Had Sub #12 today in English... Bwa ha ha.  I listened to my music, and read some more.  Went to German... Frau was getting her teaching appraisal by the administration.  Bwa ha ha.  (If only she wouldn't have pulled out the stops on review, then Dr. H would have seen the true Carol Vanabajemmahemmabemma... with the herbs, the 90 degree bending over, the hot tea, the leaving the class to take a shit, and, best of all, the HMMM-ing.  *waves fist violently*  Finished my hw in class there, as usual.  (I haven't taken my book home since German I).  So I read in the 10 minutes remaining.  Went to Physics, listened to the lecture.  Went to the office, played fetch for rowdy effies.  Read some more.  Talked with Ms. Carter about Improper Funds Management in Non-Profits.  Read some more.  Went to lunch.  Brad was sure to boast about the win over Indian Hill at Anderson.  He stated his disappointment that I didn't show.  Went to Meteorology, took a test, read some more.  Went to PreCal, forgot my homework in my locker.    Ms. King:  "Is that your home locker or your school locker?" Joe:  "Uh... My school locker?" Ms. King:  "See, that was a joke.  I know, I'm bad at them." Joe:  "Yeah, well, even if it was funny, I probably wouldn't have gotten it.  I'm really tired."  *slaps forehead* Ms. King:  "Yeah, my daughter loves jokes, and I'm just no good at them." Joe:  "Well, that one was like the joke about the airplane." Ms. King:  "Huh?" Joe:  "It was over my head." Ms. King: (puzzled)  "Oh... Hah hah." Kirsten Kinne (dumb brunette in seat next to me - 15 seconds later):  "Oh, I get it!"  So, not going over the homework, I did the stuff for tonight.  So I finished early.  So I read some more.  Grunder was absent.  We watched film clips from the 20s, narrated really crappy-like.  Not horrorshow at all.  Despite being seated direct in front of the picture box, Your Humble Narrator was still not able to hear a krovvy thing.  Not a malenky bit, I swear.  Nonetheless, I B.S.-ed some notes for extra credit.  Got on the bus.  Read some more.  Went to sleep.  Got home.  Talked on AIM.  Yeah, whateva.    In lighter news, I downloaded the whole album of Incubus... A Crow Left of the Murder.  Got every track in no more than 10 minutes... I was impressed.  However, I have no CD Burner.  Cheap malenky bratchnies...  The NADSAT kinda shows... sad boohoo.  Too much reading in one day.    Micah was upset because his friend Paul, who he's known for nearly all his life, smokes.  Micah just found this out... but it started last fall.  Oh no.  Of course, I somehow got into a discussion about religion... and he was kinda like... biting his tongue I think.  *shrugs*  He got on my nerves when he complained of too many hours at work.  It's an understandable bad... but I would kill to get a chunk of something like that.  -.-    So I think I'm gonna take a nap... Maybe knock out A Clockwork Orange, or delve deeper into the office politics book.  I dunno.    "Go for it."

        I Don't Give a Fuck What You Wish...     Song in head:  Jars of Clay  Current Mood:    You know... I had an entry here, but it was a bit too strong.  Like a 320 second shot--you just don't need it.    Hence, I'll write something nice and really vague, because although you can't read it, I already typed it all, so I'm actually feeling a tad better.    I'll go off to wash mom's car... It's kinda sad.  The only times she talks to me are to ask me to do her favors, with the exception of two phrases: "Are you feeling okay?" and "You wanna hang out?"  These phrases, to which my answers are always "Yes." and "Doing what?"  and the replies are always "Are you sure?" and "I don't know."  *shudders*   "The presence of an extremist always broadens the norm."  --Scott K. Grunder    And I'd almost put money on the bet that you're probably pissed that I didn't share the blog entry, and that I led you on.  You really wish you could see it, or wish that I wasn't such a pain in the ass.  John's dad said it best... see the subject line.

        Does Roger Burgess Count?     Song in head:  Talk Shows on Mute - Incubus  Current Mood:  Happy, but Growing Tired  I'm fading fast and still have to take out the trash, so this is hopefully short and sweet.  School day was pretty decent.  Skipped first bell, got a 91 on my German test, found out a few things, and... catch this... got a  63  on my Physics test!!  Keep in mind, that I thought that I got a 40, maybe, on this test... and a 63 is a mid-range B.  I was happy.  Lilly got a lower score, not surprisingly.  She guesses all of the multiple choice and skips the free-response.  But this was a new record... How much?  20?  No.  15?  No.  12?  No.  10?  No... 5?!?  No... Lilly got a  4  on this test.  (out of 100, of course).  She got  one  multiple-choice question right.  Oh well, I might do the same thing if I was dropping out and already had my GED.    Finally went to Warsaw to get the $$ from my paychecks.  Gave back part of the money I owe mom for covering me when they wouldn't go through.  That was good to get done.  OMNI sucked, even more than usual.  Bombarded by Kristen and Linda telling me to have a "positive attitude" while I sit through trainings on demos that I've trained other people to do.  As I told Clare, I think that my problem is an issue of respect.  I just think that I should be treated with a little more respect than I do... maybe I don't deserve it, but five years seniority counts for  something , doesn't it?  Anyhow, blew the meeting ASAP, and had a nice chat with Kathleen before heading off to Steak 'n' Shake for dinner, because Papa Johns still makes me gag.  Ate my dinner, which was way overpriced, bought some film, and came home, where I had to calm Mom's nervous breakdown... She was in a tizzy about people at the drive thru at Taco Bell and at UDF not saying "Thank you."  *shakes head*  It was pretty sad.  I mean... like... convulsions.  I really wonder sometimes, if I should check into having her admitted, for her own benefit, at least.  We'll see.  So I did some chores, and some typing, and here I am.  Not too much here.  SAT is on Saturday.  I have to ask mom for $$ to register for the ACT and SATII, which deadlines are... tomorrow for... *sigh*  late registration may be a must, even though more expensive.  I just don't know if she'll be able to cough up the dough right away.    Anyways, I'm gonna take out the trash, and come back and go to sleep.  TTFN.  English writer Malcolm Muggeridge only voted once in his life--for a candidate who had been released from an insane asylum with a Certificate of Sanity.  "What other politician anywhere has an actual medical report that he is sane?"  Muggeridge asked.  "I simply had to support him."  --DUH!  The Stupid History of the World Calendar

        Read Me!  I DARE YOU!!!     Song in head:  The Scientist - Coldplay  Current Mood:  Eh  You know, sometimes I wonder about myself.  I wonder, for instance, why it's so hard for me to be happy.  Nearly everyone thinks of me as a bitter son-of-a-bitch... and that's the image I display to them, but not on purpose.  However, I don't understand why.  Today, for instance... As you can see by my earlier entry, nothing was really wrong with today at all.  and yet, here I am again, won....  You know... Fuck it... This isn't helping.

        Well, well well... Mr. Scalf.  So nice to see you...     Song in head:  Walk This Way - Aerosmith  Current Mood:  Happy   Well, some of you may have read my AIM Away message last night, reading "Lot's of good news today."  Well, that is still true, excluding the fact that "today" is now "yesterday."  Nonetheless, I had intended to blog last night to share the good news, but got sidetracked into typing... yadda yadda yadda.  Now is just as good, though, I suppose.  So, yesterday morning, I decided not to get my morning coffee.  I've noticed myself becoming slightly dependent on it, so I'm going to scale back, if not eliminate it--at least for now.  Mostly, school was at par with usual standards--a worthless hour in English "class," an even more useless hour in German class, an ultra-hard and bomb-believed Physics test, an Astronomy video, and a total, absolute, declared free-day in Pre-Calc.  This, however, was when the good news began...  The group projects that I've been so worried about?  Well, they were both due on Friday.  Both were complete, and came off just fine.  The math project--we received a 97--very helpful to my test average to bring me up to an 85.  Further, Shoeless Ware and Sidekick Jenny thanked me for my hard work, and apologized for their antics.  I was happy.  I walked into APUS with a good mood, knowing that we had a practice multiple-choice section from the 2001 AP Exam.  These review materials are not graded for accuracy, but for completion.  Hence, there were no worries, and I even sat in "Comfy Chair," a rare and coveted opportunity.  Plus, after I finished, we got our review syllabi, and gradesheets.  Guess what?  This monster over here finally has an 83 in US History--quite an improvement over the 75 that I had at the beginning of last week.  Our project counted for 30 homework points, and 27 writing points.  We got 27/27 and a 26/30.  Furthermore, the only other thing in the writing category was the DBQ on the Cold War, which I got a 6/7.  So... 20% of my final grade was a 97.0!  I havent' missed a single homework assignment this quarter, which makes me eligible for any curve that may be applied, and I've already aced 50% of my final exam.  It was sehr good news.  Afterwards, killed some time, went to the bank, and met Clare for coffee at the Smith-Edwards Starbucks.  We had a fun conversation, and it was good to hang out.  Left there about 1645, then proceeded to meet up with John at Graeters', where I had some  killa  blackberry chip ice cream.  We picked up his father figure, dropped him off, stopped at a book store, then shot up to White Castle for coffee and stuff.  Had another good conversation, and more loads of fun.  After hitting McDonald's for a McFlurry, we parted and I drove on back home, where I pulled in at 2158.  (Damn, I am so good.)  Mom was in a relatively good mood, which was nice.  I got some mail, and I've been asked to be a member of the National Society of High School Scholars, been nominated for a Walnut Hills "Book Award" (which I still have no idea what it is, other than an honor), and I got a call from Jim Bernecker at Relay Express to set up an interview for a job as a Customer Service Rep.  *snaps fingers*  It merited quite the "Hot damn."  Then, pursuing my new manuscript typing side-job, I started to type "Four-Wheeled Angel," which certainly is, by far, one of my favorites.  (Of course, an experience of mine apparently was the inspiration, so I'm not surprised.)  It was nice to read it again, and stuff like that.  So I come into school today, kinda tired, because I didnt' get to bed until 1 last night.  Had an even more worthless English class than yesterday, because Dave Thomas didn't finish grading our work for midterms, due today.  So, I catch up on my reading, find out that Megan is learning to knit, or learning to knit better, and go to German to take my test.  It was relatively easy, which was cool.  Tim's obvious cheating, and Frau's utter stupidity and obliviousness continue to amuse me.  Had a nice little short conversation afterwards, spanning about 45 seconds, but with no awkward silences or space fillers, or the like--I do value such ineractions with other people so very much... especially when "other people" consist of attractive females.    I'm going to call back Bernecker soon here and schedule my interview, for Thursday, hopefully.  We have another single bell in Physics tomorrow, but we begin nuclear physics.  Bleh.  Astronomy test and Math test coming up, along with a review presentation in APUS and going to Habitat.  It appears that the rest of the day will be... okay... but that is still balanced by overwhelming goodness to bring the raw score up to at least 7.5.  (*stamp*)  Anyhow, I shall go to take my lunch, and bid you all adieu...  And that's the way it was, April 27, 2004.

        Fast Times at the Essex Inn...     Song in head:  The Reaon - Hoobastank  Current Mood:  Mixed Up  Upon return from Chicago, there's a lot going on... So much, in fact, that I don't really want to talk about the trip just yet, but rather the stuff going on afterwards...  In fact, I'm so confused.  The only thing that seems to be giving me joy is this song, and looking forward to Starbucks tomorrow.  But... I waffle.    So, we get back to the museum.  I find out that everyone in the building, since we've switched to Paycor, is getting their direct deposits late.  Thus, I'll have to fill out another form to sent to Paula boyers, changing that over.  Another hassle.  I got along with Don quite well over the weekend, but I still dislike him.  I wonder why, but I know why, and I find myself justified, but still... it's one of those things.  I didn't bond with anyone on this trip, bar Kristen and Don, and Jason Strunk a little bit.  Well, I take it back, Max and Jonah also, but I already knew them.    I got in my car, and it felt so good.  So good... like a rush of energy.  I did donuts in the completely empty front south lot, figure 8's around the light posts, and an e-brake turn, pushing about 45... fun.  but I rode home, and I felt like Memphis Rains from  Gone in 60 Seconds...   "You just glide..."  All of my aggressive, over energy was used there, and I drove the speed limit all the way home.  It was so blissful.    I got home and I was happy to be there, for the first time in a long while.  I hummed Crocodile Rock on the way into the house... I figured mom would be awake, and she was asleep, but in the living room chair.  She was trying to stay up for me.  However, not much of a hug or a "Welcome home."  No note on the table like there usually is, no special treat or anything.  Although I never required or asked for those things, I liked them--and they were nice little gestures.  I guess, that I've never said that well enough.  Of course, when you look at it, this is what my life has really become.  I've grown to resent my family so much, it seems, but I don't hate them.  I know that this is the way it's supposed to go down, I guess, but... I don't know.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I just wish things could go back to where mom and I could be not just civil, but friends.  *sigh*  Of course, there was a notecard waiting for me... that triggered my nearly immediate exit to the basement.  Gave me some numbers and figures, and ended with "You either pay $20.00/mo. for high-speed internet or we have to switch to dial-up.  It really makes me   sick   that I can't comfortably cough that up.  I wouldn't mind paying it... I know that zoomtown is a luxury that I don't need...  but I can't.     So, in summation, I get back from a mediocre trip, certainly not the most memorable of weekends, but memorable, sure; and I go from loving life, to hating it again.  Does it ever stop?  As Journey would say "The wheel in the sky keeps on turning, Don't know where I'll be tomorrow..."  I just wish that  something  would stabilize... something to hold onto, to cling to when times are rough, and when they're good... some sort of anchor... a ground... you know what I mean.  The trip... Well, it was Chicago, which made it fun for me, even if it would have been total shit on the Youth Program end.  However, it was only mediocre... nothing too terribly special.  I dont' really feel like talking about it, but details are available upon request.  Everyone will find out eventually, through one medium or another, I trust.  In the mean time, I depart, and I bid adieu.     I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do. But I continue learning, I never meant to do those things to you. And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you...  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with every day And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear I found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you... And the reason is you... And the reason is you... And the reason is you...  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you. I found a reason to show The side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you.   "The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently."  --Frederick Nietsche

       Song in head:  Session - Linkin Park  Current Mood:  Multitude    There's A Big Difference Between My Mom and Richard Simmons...    Yesterday was rather fun and amusing.  I came up to Kenwood to meet John at Starbucks.  Of course, as I walk in, Matt says "God!  I hate my life!"  However, it was pretty fun.  Matt was ultra bitchy for some reason--I have no idea.  Maybe a rough day at the office.  I was standing there doing nothing and he claimed that I was "distracting" Nema from working the bar, and, if I didn't know any better, I'd say he was gonna kick me out of the store.  It was kinda freaky.  However, I hold some pride, because I sucked back 3 doppios while I was there, all of gradually increasing strength.  The first were about 45 seconds, the second round was 100 flat, and the third was *drum roll*  320 seconds .  Yeah, it was crazy, and yes, I was rather hyper.  I'm not ashamed.  I had some fun, and I broke a record, so I was down with that.  However, John later puked in the Starbucks bathroom, which explained his rather subdued demeanor.  Hence, we left, and we picked up his father and took him home.  Like I said, it was fun.  As for the quote, that's an ad nauseam from Matt's crazy and wacky behavior at Starbucks.  It was some sort of a cap war, I believe.  *shrugs*  I don't really try to keep track of that guy, and there's a reason.    "Shouldn't Nick be Doing This?"  "He Should Be..."    After our coffee adventures, John and I stopped at the Wendy's on UCB, figuring that food in our stomachs would do no harm.  Of course, he has conversations with everyone there, including Melissa, who was doing the schedule in the Dining Room.  It was rather amusing to see a guy in a tee shirt and blue jean shorts just kinda hop back and forth from in front of and behind the counter, sometimes half way, ringing up his own order, and just making his own nuggets... and no one cared.  It looked slightly out of place.  However, the food was good, and I wasnt' complaining.  I still don't believe that Chipotle would be giving out free burritos just because it's 420... but that's not my problem.  What followed the Wendy's was frozen custard, a killer headache, of nearly migraine proportion, and a trip for Tylenol that resulted in 3 packs of Bubblicious, all chewed at once.  (That was so sick... utterly, disgusting).  However, again, not my problem, I didnt' chew 'em.  *maniacal laughter*    Are You Okay?    So I come home, and immediately take a shower, b/c I was ultra greasy.  It felt so good... to be clean.  I was reeling it in.  But then I went downstairs to relax--it had been a long day.  I sat down with a book, and opened the window to get some fresh air, but mom came down to do laundry.  Not a problem, but I was ready to sleep, and she decides to hold a conversation over the wall... I wasn't game, and I didnt' hide it.  So I'm all snappy, and she's like "Are you okay?"  At said point, I just hissed back "I'm trying to go to bed, damnit!"  That was the end of that.  Well, so I thought.  About that time, I realized that the damn hairband wasn't on my wrist, which triggered a nice 45-minute search, to find that it was in the sleve of my jacket.  I almost stopped looking, and said "Why the hell do I care?"  *shrugs*  It was a relief to find it, and I don't know why precisely, but hey.  Thus, it was now 0045, and I couldnt' sleep.  I tried, though, and eventually nodded off, but woke up many times in the night.     Just Because She's Pretty Doesn't Mean She's a Bitch...    Hence, I was dead tired this morning, meriting a stop at the chateau.  It really did help me through the day.  However, I still can't get over that damn girl... *screams*  I should just let it go.  I took the hint, I'm not going to call anymore, but still.  Fuck it.  Who cares, eh?  I went to German, where we talked about bad drivers, and everyone stares at Tim Bedinghaus.  Sure, he's a shitty driver, everyone knows it.  He's got six points, and he's only 17.  That was funny.  I did all of the problems handed out in Physics, and got them right, for the first time EVER.  I really feel kinda prepared for AP, despite that Physics B is the hardest exam, barring CompSci.  In fact, the "harder" Physics section, Physics C, has an easier exam.  I've known that people walk out of the Physics B exam in tears... it's not uncommon.  The average score of last year's kids:  2.58.  *eek*  However, Meteoro was easy, since it was a lesson we had done two days earlier in physics, and my group projects are actually moving along nicely, oddly enough.  Both due on Friday, I think.  History was interesting, but I have a test tomorrow.  Thus, this will be the last night worrying about Grunder's shit... Notecards-DONE.  Tests-DONE.  Essays-DONE.  DBQs-DONE.  Only to study for the ultra-easy AP exam.  not bad.      The Mini-Nervous Breakdown...    You know, YAC just gets more and more annoying.  I don't feel like going into it, but let's just say that the excuses I have started to use to get out of it are getting more and more interesting, and actually fun to come up with and execute.  Of course, I would be nowhere without my beautiful partner in crime.  ;-)  It all works, I believe.  That's the most interesting of the events of the past two days.  More details available upon request, just like references.  Helga... it just doesn't do justice.

        This sucks...     Song in head:   Chemistry - Semisonic  Current Mood:     Okay, so I overslept this morning.  I was not surprised by this.  In fact, after I had woken up for the fifth time at 0300, I decided that I would.  In fact, Mom overslept too, so I was further disinclined to have to RUSH to get ready this morning, opposed to the regular pace.  Anyhow, I only wanted to oversleep, just an hour or two, and go in late.  Not to miss any classes or anything, but because I knew I would need the rest.  In fact, I really need to go to school today, so that I can meet with my group project partner at lunch, and so that I can try to mend this whole Megan thing, etc.  However, as I sat here, ready to go, I realized something.  I had an English quiz this morning.  Hence, I would take a 0 for the quiz if I had an unexcused absence, since he doesn't give makeups for them.  Well, thanks to Walnut policies, where there MUST be a note from a parent, and a phone call won't do, my tardiness would automatically be unexcused, no matter what excuse I made up, unless I would go the steps to FORGE my own note that said I had a DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.  Now, seasoned liars know which excuses work and which ones don't, and which ones are iffy.  Well, I also happen to be a  cautious  liar, who only uses the ones which are sure bets.  Hence, a doctor's appointment is a real stretch... they have multiple means of attempting to verify it, all which would say that I had no appointment, you know.  So, my only option, being a good little boy, is to SKIP THE REST OF THE DAY.  Then, I can bring in a note tomorrow to the effect of personal illness, as written by Mom, and I'll have an excused absence.  However, I will have missed the whole day... I really didn't want to do that, but I have not choice here.  Hence, this sucks.  So I'll need to find something to do for the entire day.  I have no idea.  I need to run to the bank to bring my checking account balance up from the $1 mark... I should probably stop by Kathy's sometime, because I  am  quite dependent upon my PalmPilot.  I'll do some chores to make up for my less-than-optimal behavior here... I have no idea.  I'm not looking forward to it though... I enjoy having stuff to do.  Bah.

        And My Report Will Read 'IDGARA'...     Song in head:  Sympathy - Goo Goo Dolls  Current Mood:  Depressed  "All good things must come to an end."  I suppose this is true.  For example, my week-long mood of happiness.  It's gone now.  I'm not surprised... I could make a list of all the crap that's depressing me, but you don't care.  Oh well... Skip it for all I care...  I suppose that the strain was inevitable.  In fact, escaping it for this long has been quite a feat I believe.  However, the deal seems to be sealed now.  *shrugs*  I probably shouldn't care, but I do.  That's exactly my problem... I care.  I just need to stop caring... about everything, everyone.  All my psychobabbling bullshit... where has it gotten me?  Seriously... "I'll volunteer to help people.  I have such a passion to help others."  I get thrown for a loop, deceived, and barely even make enough to make my checks worth the paper they're printed on.  I end up impressing too many people, and finding out too much information, and getting reprimanded.  I'm introduced into business politics before graduating high school.  "I don't need physical beauty, as long as there's great content on the inside."  People scoff at my optimism and stupidity, tell me they're fed up with hearing it, everyone concentrates on sex anyhow, and I end up missing my deadline, not having a girlfriend (let alone a reason to go to Prom), and about as much chance of gettng laid as a guy who walks around barefoot and looks like a bum.  "I don't need material possessions.  They are nice, but I'd love to save my money, just to have a safety net.  It's not in spending the money, it's in knowing you can."  I end up having a job that pays the least amount permitted by federal law, no money in the bank, my $2500 savings reduced to $10.18, and my checking account floating around at $8 or so.  My friends and people I know end up loaning me money all of the time, and I am one of the biggest moochers I've ever known, it seems.  "No need to overwork yourself.  Work smarter, not harder."  I'm one of the laziest AP students there are at my school, I haven't done homework at home since October, I believe, and my glorious 3.4 GPA starts slipping away.  "Money won't be an issue for college.  There are so many grants and scholarships, and I'll fill in the rest with loans."  Fat chance.  That's all I have to say.  Mom can't even pay my $164 for AP exams... How the fuck is she gonna put me through college unless I end up paying for it until age 50?  "I have enough self-control and I've seen enough that I will never touch alcohol."  I still have never been drunk, but I certainly have "touched" alcohol...  "I love my mom more than anything."  That's perhaps the most scary one... the most brutally horrible contradiction.    I give up.  Let the steel plating take me away, I say.  Jimmy says it fine:  "As I walk this land of broken dreams, I have visions of many things.   But happiness is just an illusion,  filled with sadness and confusion.    What becomes of the broken hearted who had love that's now departed?  I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind...."  Fuck it all...   SHRINK:  "Hunter, if you leave, my report will read 'AMA'; that you were signed out of this hospital against medical advice." ADAMS:  "And my report will read 'IDGARA'.  I don't give a rat's ass!"  "I'm going to go die in a hole." "Oh, no you're not." "Like you'll stop me?" "Well, no... but if you go, then I go." "Bullshit." "Nope, all's truth.  You die in a hole, we both die in a hole." "You'd do that for me?" "You betcha." "Well... maybe just a small ditch then, eh?"

        Ware Carlton-Ford Can suck the cock of GWB...     Song in head:  The Sweet Sound of a Large Club Dealing a Nice Blow Across the Face  Current Mood:  Disgusted  Okay, so I'm sitting here in Pre-Calculus Class, and we're supposed to be working on our projects, right?  Well, that's what I was told, and I haven't found anyone in disagreement yet.  Let's keep in mind here that I have already done my part of the project (which was outlined by contract, mind you).  I've done my article, and put it in the layout, and I'm ready and waiting for the other articles by Shoeless Ware and Sidekick Jenny to come in.  So I say... "Do you guys have anything?"  "Well, uh... um... uh..."  Fuck.  This project is worth a test grade, one which I could REALLY use 100 on, since my math grade is a 78.5 right now, and here are these two fucking lovebirds who can't do anything but whisper about me...   CARLTON-FORD:  "You really hate me, don't you?" SCALF:  "No, I don't hate you at all.  You're actually alright.  I find your humor a tad dry, but that's not bad, that's just my tastes." CARLTON-FORD:  "Oh... I see.  Well, I haven't heard any particularly wet humor out of you." SCALF:  "I'll maintain my composure and refrain from comment here." CARLTON-FORD:  "Oh, no.  Bring it on..." SCALF:  "Well, at least I know that I'm not funny, and I keep my fucking mouth shut, you prick." CARLTON-FORD:  "Come on, bring it.... What have you got to say?" SCALF:  "I just said it, ass." CARLTON-FORD:  "Oh, I would have expected something more." SCALF:  *smiles*  *looks at Ware's bare feet, and his holed white t-shirt and knappy hair*  *thinks of bum* *chuckles* CARLTON-FORD:  "What's so funny?" SCALF:  "Oh, nothing."  So I'm sitting here, and I have nothing to do.  I don't have my Norton (because I thought I was gonna be working on this project) and I finally got Shoeless Ware and ditzy counterpart to go use some other computers in the lab to actually DO SOMETHING!!!    Okay, so I'm done.  I did get to do some job searching, and I'm gonna start writing letters here now.  At least  I  (of all people) am being PRODUCTIVE!!!  BAH!!!  Okay, I can think of the sight of Dr. B jamming to R&B... that's funny.  Still in a good mood.  HA!

        He's An Angry One, He Is...     Song in head:  This Is War - Smile Empty Soul  Current Mood:  Unsure  I'm just a normal man, I wouldn't nothing at all, but here we are.  Our leaders have a plan, I'll probably kill if it's for them, and here we are.  I drove in a car, I flew in a plane, to come to your house, and kick your door in.  Now it's time for this, it's just you and me, I'll blow your fucking head off, for my country.  Today was interesting.  Good on the whole, I do believe.  First bell went well academically.  Practically aced a quiz, after reading only the ClassicNotes from the Web.  Socially, well, blah.  Still, I went to 2nd bell smiling.  Goofed off in German, joked with Tim the whole time.  Took a quiz in there, that I prob. got a 105 on, like I always do.  Poor gal, just staring at the greenboard... blank.  Lifeless, nearly.  Went to Physics, had fun in there.  We started Modern Physics, dealing with quantum mechanics.  Whee!  (well, maybe "Gah!!" is more like it...)  Relativity is next.  Bwa ha ha goes the Burgess.  I had a study hall, because the office was self-sufficient today.  Lunch was pretty boring... I sat on the commons and wrote for most of the time.  About... stuff.  We watched a cool video in Meteoro about interplanetary impacts... that was pretty cool.    A bunch of other minor shit happened, but you really don't care, I can almost guarantee.    I go to church and tithe, I go to work in a suit and tie, but this is war.  I'm really not sure why the TV says that you were wrong, but here we are.  I drove in a car, I flew in a plane, to come to your house, and kick your door in.  Now it's time for this, it's just you and me, I'll blow your fucking head off, for my country.    Came home, watched a film on TV.  It was sehr funny.  I still longed for a decent meal, and had no hopes of getting it.  I do have an MRI tomorrow in Kenwood.  Afterwards, a cheesy evening event.  However, I'm working with Linda, and we get to sit down for dinner, and meet with Gov. Taft, so I'm sure that it will be a blast.  Disliking Taft is one of the few political bits that Linda and I get along by.  "I agree, he is squandering our budget.... He's not the best Republican we could put in there."  *shakes head*  Anyhow, I went out with John to Waffle House, and had a pretty crappy meal, including some hashbrowns that conveyed a taste to that degree.  Crap.  If I could have imagined eating shit, that was it.  We went to a McDonald's later, and I got my ass beaten at Stratego... esp. since I didn't know that you couldn't move over water.  -.-  j/k!    My feet hurt from the sand, but still I march now gun in hand, 'cause this is war.  This isn't what I planned.  I wanted to be so much more, but this is war.  I drove in a car, I flew in a plane, to come to your house, and kick your door in.  Now it's time for this, it's just you and me, I'll blow your fucking head off, for my country.  I finally found my answer in the most unlikely of places:   You're just a great guy.

        Nucking Futs!...     Song in head:  Road Trippin' - Red Hot Chili Peppers  Current Mood:  Content     What I Will Remember About Spring Break 2004:     -Hopping on the car and driving in circles. -Finally saying "Hello" to every person in the Habitat office. -Walking along the riverfront, and running into the whole Mobley family. -"You'll be in this picture, goddamnit.  Like it or not." -"Oh, I'll just call her 'Superchick' to keep her straight" -Being right in the neighborhood... of Cincinnati. -"Joe, get in this house right now." -Talks on potential. -The really bad taste of a cold caffe latte. -Doing absolutely nothing... you get what you pay for. -Stopping by anyhow, just for the hell of it. -"Come on, I'll even pay for it."  *uproarious laughter* -"GO HOME!!!" -Dinner at Dunkin' Donuts. -0100 Breakfast at Perkins. -"Don't even pretend to worry about it." -Impromptu decisions to drive... for no reason... to Dayton, Indy, Chicago. -Car shopping, and the misadventures of Grover's business cards. -"Hell, I wanna sell cars.  I'll just put on a tie, send 'em inside when they make a decision.  Who needs cards?" -Two-hour cell phone conversations. -Calling the girl, talking to her mother. -The most fun I've had at a YAC meeting since... since... since... -Finally learning to respect the silence. -Half-gallons of milk... that taste too sweet. -Enjoying the entire CBS lineup. -Random acts of kindness. -Hanging out with mom--for the good and the bad. -"Oh, you're in Indianapolis.  Why?" -"Just driving around, because that's what we do." -Finally realizing the true meaning of "ditzy 13-year-old." -Chillin' at Starbucks... just sitting, while the staff washes the walls. -Typewriters in donut joints. -"Where to?"  "Well, there's Chicago..." -Not getting a paycheck, but finding out about "Norbert."  That's priceless. :-D -"Indiana?  Jail?  The Moon?  My house?  You're not downstairs, are you?" -"Soliciting is prohibited on CTA trains.  Violators will be arrested." -"Hu muh muh luh see muh?" -You missed it, John.  He was a mute bum.  He wrote a sign and all.  All I read was "Hi, I'm Greg." -Easter? -Finally getting a response, and finding out why I didn't get one sooner. -"A recluse."  Wow...

        Would You Like A Postcard?     Song in head:  Teenage Wasteland - The Who  Current Mood:  Spacey  Today was very interesting.  The big 'hang out' day with Mom really did start off OK, went really terrible, then eventually picked back up at dinner time.  I actually had a decent time at dinner, and she walked away with a few of her 'fears' solved... i.e. "No, Mom, I'm not having sex, doing drugs, or drinking."  Nonetheless, it was OK.    However, the day with Mom--however eventful, exciting, or none of the above--did come to an end around 2145.  I was just ready for something else besides my mother.  (Of course, I had to deny that, but hey).  So, I finished filling up my tank (defective pump earlier in the day left me thinking it was full, but really only at 3/4), and thought for a bit.  "What can I do?"  says myself.  So, I examine what I've done in the past week.  I've hung out with John almost every night, hitting a coffee joint of some sort at some point each time.  Now, however, I already had my coffee from Thornton's.  So, I had been driving.  I'd gone to Dayton with John, New Richmond and beyond out Rt. 52 with Kathleen, and in the past have been to Louisville, Lexington, and Columbus.  So, what was left?  I pondered this for a short while, then decided to go to a new place... one in which the next stops were not Lexington, Louisville, Dayton, and Columbus; but rather St. Louis, Chicago, Columbus, and Cincinnati.  To the place where 75, 71, and 275 no longer reigned supreme, but gave rise to the ultra superpowers that are Interstates 65, 70, 74, and 465.  Certainly, Indianapolis isn't  the  most interesting place on the planet, but it's something new, and it was doable... So, I said "Why not?"  It was about 2200 hrs by now, so I drove, and drove, and drove.  It didn't seem to take long at all.  Finally found my way into town, without getting lost, shot at, or mugged, and totally making a random guess that Market St. would take me into the CBD.  So got down there around 2330, took some pictures of stuff.  Met a really nice bum who gave me a free postcard.  I did decide to give him some change, despite the fact that I figured he stole the postcards.  It was a cool little town, though.  A little too cool, I found, as I looked at my watch and realized I had slightly overstayed my welcome.    I had called mom at 2200, letting her know I'd be out until 0215, but she called at 0030 just to kinda chat.  I told her where I was, that I was coming home (and withheld the fact that I had just barely found my way back to I-74--but once again, without getting lost once--I really am the God of Direction).  All was fine and dandy.... Well, if you cut out that possum, but that's a whole other story.  So, I can now say that I've gone north, northeast, east, south, southwest, west, and northwest... that just about covers the whole rose.  Now to extend the distances... bwa ha ha.    On the whole, I am happy.  4.5 hrs, 215 miles, a half tank of gas, a cup of coffee, one possum, and a Pepsi later, I'm glad I went.  Worth the $12 in expenses.    Also--Saw the Dr. this morning.  I have to get an MRI (in Kenwood, mind you--not on purpose LOL) to check out this stupid tremor, and will eventually have to see the neurologist again.  He said it's probably benign and meaningless, but it doesn't hurt to check.  My official height/weight was 5'8", 156 lbs... which made me happy, because my scale was fucked up enough to tell me I was below 150.  That was scary.    Well, tomorrow is Saturday.  We shall see what she has in store.  However, this silly goose has a sore neck from all his road-watching, and is going to catch some Z's...  TTYL  I was going to put in the lyrics to  Damn, It Feels Good To Be a Gangsta ... but that was a tad bit too obscene, given this FCC bulls***.  Thus, I'll leave you with the Barney Song.   I love you, you love me.  We're a happy family, with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you, won't you say you love me too?   Can you believe they pulled Stern?  Granted, I'm not a fan, but I think he deserves his rights.  *shakes head*  Oh well.

        Crusty Gigglebrain...     Song in head:  Take a Picture - Filter  Current Mood:  Unsure  Reflecting on a good part of the Spring Break former, I've found that I cannot yet pass judgement on whether or not this was a good break.  I think a lot about that movie  The Girl Next Door.   It starts off with the guy filing out this form in his senior year for the yearbook.  The form says "I Will Always Remember..." and has a bunch of blank lines.  He can't fill it out.  (He can by the end of the film, but that's besides the point).  It's definitely been the most interesting ten months of my life, these last ones.  It is kinda funny... it all correlates with me being able to drive.  I suppose this is a good sign--maybe that all I need is my independence, and life will be okay.  The road blocks, every now and then, seem difficult to overcome, but hey, that's life.    In the mean time, I have no idea.  I'm actually spending most of the day at home today, I believe.  Perhaps because I came to the realization last night, that I really am rarely ever here, and Spring Break merely accelerated that.  I towed LJ out of the garage using the C-Bomber, and cleaned it out.  That was nice.  Put my bike back together, and the garage doesn't have oil-soaked newspaper all over it now.  Changed the flat tire on LJ, so I was actually able to  push  it back into the garage.    I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.  He will probably find it curious that I have lost about 20 lbs, and haven't been exercising.  Hmmm... Then Mom and I are going to spend the day together.  I'm not looking forward to it.  I would be, except I know that at some point, it will turn to shit over something stupid.  I would nearly kill to be able to just hang out with her, without her stupid "rich lifestyle" "fancy car" or "trust in God" comments.  Even moreso, to be able to relax around her without hearing bullshit about it.    I want to write... but I don't know how to say any of it.  That mind of mine really is wandering quite a bit, but I don't know how to track the brain waves.  Thus, oye.    Maybe I'll be back later... who knows?    A Teenage Wasteland...

        By All Means, That Should've Worked... It Was a Perfect Setup...     Song in head:  Chemistry - Semisonic  Current Mood:  Tired  It has been an interesting day... from sleeping in, to apologies from the babysitter, to car shopping, to two-hour cell phone convos about ppl I've never met, to hanging out in a new bookstore, to finding out that poor Megan was in the hospital all of last night and is still recovering from the damn mouth surgery, to seeing a fairly decent film, to hitting a Dunkin Donuts, to driving to Dayton, to coming back home at 0230....  Quite the interesting stuff.  Tomorrow is a day of actual work, somewhat.  I have to go to Habitat, because I forgot to today, being out of the routine.  Then, there's the YAC meeting from 1630-1830.  Maybe talking with that gal somewhere in between.  I left a message with her mother, so we shall see.  That is, if the tracheal swelling has gone down.  Oye.    Tomorrow is Wednesday.  What the fuck?  As for me, the bed will be seeing a bit more of me in the next few minutes.  As for you, fair thee well until we meet again.   I remember when I found out about chemistry.  It was a long, long way from here.  I was old enough to want it but younger than I wanted to be.  Suddenly my mission was clear.  So for a while I conducted experiments, and I was amazed by the things I learned from the fine, fine girl, nothing but good intentions and a bad tendency to get burned.  Oh, all about chemistry, won't you show me everything you know?  Oh, wonder what you'd do to me?   Some time later I met a young graduate, when I had nobody to call my own.  I told her I was looking for somebody to appreciate, and I just couldn't do it alone.  So for a while we conducted experiments in an apartment by the river road, and we found out that the two things we put together had a bad tendency to explode.  Oh, all about chemistry, won't you show me everything you've learned?  I'll memorize everything you do to me so I can teach it when it comes my turn.     Damn, what a cool song... and that's only part!

        There's Too Many 'What ifs' in there, Joe...     Song in head:  Fields of Gold - Sting  Current Mood:  Philosophical  If you were to die, and knew, for certain, somehow that your days were simply... numbered.  What if you only had one week left to live... exactly one week.  What would you do?  Who would you talk to?  What would you say to them?  Go ahead, call me crazy, tell me to see a shrink, hell, quit reading for all I care, but think about it.  What would you do during your last week alive, so that it all would be worthwhile?  Would you ask out the boy/girl of your dreams?  Would you make a bunch of apologies?  Would you say 'Fuck 'em' and just sieze the days?    As you lay on your death bed, life is measured by the clock, and, despite your best efforts, it won't stop ticking.  No matter what you do, you know that you are about to enter the great realm of the unknown.  What enters your head?  Who or what do you think about?  What song will be repeating over and over, or what experience will you flash back to?  You know, one of those 'flashbulb memory' moments where you remember how it was, to the letter, to the second, and including all of the sounds, smells, and feelings.  What is your dying wish or thought?  And after you die, there's a funeral for you.  Someone says a nice eulogy, even if they really didn't know you.  The wrench is pulled out, and you are lowered into the casket, the lid is closed, and six mournful bodies cover the casket with a dark cloth and carry it out to the hearse.  There's a funeral procession, and a nice bit said at the grave.  The diggers come later, and lower the casket into the vault, covering it over forever... Trapped forever inside is your body, having met with death prematurely.    People come to visit you every now and then--children, parents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, the whole lot.  Sometimes they cry.  But that dying wish... the last thought of your life, never to leave your lips... they never know.  They never will know, not until they die, and even then--no guarantees.    What was it?  I find it to be of the utmost interest to observe the human race as it lives, eats, breathes, acts.  A photograph, for instance, may tell so much about a person.  The portrait of a face--it can reveal the most important parts of a person--age, mood, history, depression...  If I ever do finally figure out the wonder of freezing time on film, I aspire to be like one person--a role model, if you will.  Oddly enough, he is the same role model I have utterly followed since I came to know of him at age 11.  A man whose life I can look at, and say "If I lived that, I would come home smiling every day, because that's what I want to be."  Funny, how you can never meet a man, a man who died when I was 6 years old mind you, and consider him in such high standing.  *really digressed there*  Anyhow... Think about it.  Kinda deep, in this guy's opinion.

        We All Have a Face That We Hide Away Forever...     Song in head:  Layla - Eric Clapton  Current Mood:  Feeling Strangely Fine  Well, it's kinda odd.  I'm so determined to have a good time over this spring break, that I'm just tuning everything out... Like Mom, like my money problems, like all that junk.  It's kinda cool, to be so carefree sometimes.  However, at some points, all that crap comes out to haunt.  *shrugs*  Still, not too shabby.    But here I am.  The parade went fairly well, and was a good deal of fun.  I could have been just fine without Don, but hey, you really just can't win them all.  But, there's an evening event starting at 1800, in about a half hour.  I have Lonna Kingsbury and Walt McCabe coming in--two of the shittiest workers we got.  In fact, I was only dragged in on the account that they will be too shitty to do it on their own, and I need to "train" them.  This is really sad, considering that they are Sp. Events Dept. leftovers, from like exhibits such as Liberty on the Border, and Walt even works as a Sup. in Vatican (which, mind you, explains his inherent shittiness as a worker).    It's kinda sad... I'm really falling... That's pretty bad.  Then again, I was startled... Why should I be surprised?  So maybe it's not so bad... Who knows?  Anyhow... I have an evening event to run.  I'm at T-10 minutes, with no staff, no call from the kiosk, and no walkthrough completed... So, I'm gonna go.  TTYL.   Queen - Nevermore

        Any Given Sunday...     Song in head:  Urgent - Foreigner  Current Mood:  Pretty Good  So... it's another Sunday down at the Museum Center.  I tell ya, sometimes they all seem the same, yet every week there seems to be a new distinguishing characteristic that makes up the day.  I'm afraid I must be brief, so I'll exclude, for now, the fine events of the Friday and Saturday most recently completed, however, I will, by these means, make light of some of the highlights of my day at the present location, as it has come to be as of yet.  Woke up this morning around 1015.  I remembered to reset all of the clocks, not only in my room, but in the house also.  Mom, however, forgot about the one in her room.  Thus, at 1030, when she was in the shower and I said "I'm leaving." She says "Already?"  And I'm like "I'm actually leaving later than usual--it's 1030."  "1030?!?"  "Yeah, time change?"  "Oh, shit!!"    Washed the toys with Kate.  She claimed to forget how it was done, only seeing once before, a long time ago.  CCM Staff didn't take kindly to my joke... "We have come to comandeer your dishwasher."  Kim came in, and didn't take her coat off before she started bitching at a kid for coming in early.  *shakes head*  She also stood three feet from me, and still didn't say "Good morning."  Bwa ha ha...   So I say to Kate... "Well, to properly train you, I should technically do some of this (in case you learn by watching), let you do some of it (in case you learn by doing), and then narrate all of the steps (in case you learn by hearing).  Now, do I have to do all of that, or will you just remember it?"  "I'll just remember it."  "Good answer... So what do you do the next time you are told to wash the toys?"  "Pretend like I forget how to do it."  So then Adin came in.  Ha.  I'm pretty sure that he still is bitter towards me, and in some ways, it bothers me, but I think that I really don't care.  He sat here for an hour telling me all about his reenacting, and how he wrecked his car... Showed me this new knife he bought.  Complained about the idiocy running rampant in this building... The usual.  Then he started with the life advice-- "Make sure you go to college far away... And try to work for a university.  I remember some of the old stories you used to tell me... and you just need to get away."  I'm not sure if I appreciate his concern, or wish to burn it... *shrugs*  Oh well.  At some points, he brought up some stuff that I just wanted to walk out for... but hey, his problem, not mine.  The funniest:  "Well, we went to the Hofbrauhaus and they have this special beer they brew and these one liter glasses.  Everyone else had already ordered something, so I ended up getting it.  Bet they didn't see that one going to a 19-year old!  But I can hold my own pretty well."  "That'll just be $1.60 today, darling."  "Thanks a lot.  See ya next week!"   I think I'm gonna "let my plans fall through."  We shall see.    Spring Break:  So happy.  First real day off tomorrow.  Yay.  Opening Day Parade tomorrow... big fun, I reckon.  Wheee!

        Why Are You All Dressed Up?     Song in head:  *shrugs*  Current Mood:  Pleased  So today is officially the first day of summer.  I am rather excited, I do believe, despite never catching up with a certain female.  I suppose that will be put back in the box for at least a couple weeks.  It feels so awkward to finally be caught up on sleep... to have a decent night's rest... two nights in a row.  It's so uncanny, almost, that it's almost scary.    I was late to work yesterday, which I felt really bad about.  Especially since my tardiness caused some four-odd people to cover my drawer in my absence... and, in turn, $90 in cash vanished into thin air.  I can't be pinned for it, because it was banked off when I finally got in (1.25 hrs late).  However, John will probably catch heat for it, because he was in charge at the time.  I hate being late for stuff, especially when it's caused by oversleeping... in mid-afternoon.  *shakes head*  I'll get over it, I do believe.  However, I've been becoming more "on top of my game" so to speak... I did front reg through lunch rush today, and sure, I had a manager for my runner, but it went very smoothly, so I wasn't complaining.    I wrestled with Memorial day Weekend Traffic to get down to Habitat--there was no deposit today, but some other projects.  Susan (the ED) asked me why I was all dressed-up... I was wearing my work uniform.  I told her how I work at a Wendy's now because CMC wasn't paying the bills... she said it was a shame, and I talked her down, denying it.  I get to take Tuesday off... coincidence?  i finally sold El Junko yesterday... for $50.  I traded in my formerly beloved automobile for a haircut and a pair of work shoes from Wal-Mart.  Oddly enough, these are the most comfortable shoes that i've worn in ages--they are Dr. Scholl's brand, after all.  I dunno... it's some good shit.  So I'm sitting downtown at the library... because the traffic is pointless to fight.  I probably won't depart until their cheap-asses close at 6... However, I want to check out the CDs... so I'm off.    Good Riddens.

        Quite the Interesting Concept...     Song in head:  The Way - Fastball  Current Mood:  Happy  Well, I just finished my PreCalculus Exam, which means that I'm done with this fucking waste of time forever and ever and ever... until next year in Calc AP-BC.  *blec*  However, I will be rid of Ms. King-that's quite a plus.  We took our exam on the computer with a special program that the school bought... It was pretty neat, rather easy, and hella less stressful than filling in all those bubbles.  Also, it scores it immediately--there were three parts, and I got 21/23 on the first one, 22/23 on the second one, and 17/23 on the third--ultimately an 86.  Not shabby at all for a class that I don't care about and an exam that I didn't study for.  Bwa ha ha.  I only have one more "exam" left before this godforsaken year is all over.  Grunder's exam... isn't an exam.  He's manipulated the answer choices so that the key will spell out a special phrase or quotation.  Hence, the only way to not get 100% is to be a total idiot and not listen to the instructions.  I talked to DB today--I got an 83 on the Meteoro exam (which he bumped to an 85 so I'd have an A) and a 75 on the Physics exam.  I'm pretty happy.  It all works out pretty well, I believe.  I'll have an A for the semester in Meteoro, a B in Physics, a B in PreCal, maybe an A in APUS (but probably a B), an A in German, and most likely a B in English.  I'm not complaining in the least.  Considering the amount of work that I've done this year, B's are generous.  Also, Jr. year is the hardest, so I complain not.  After class, I intend to track down the elusive female... she's right down the hall in DB's class.  We talked before I came down here to start my exam, but only briefly.  With all luck, I'll get up the guts to ask her out again before summer kicks in.  *shrugs*  We shall see indeed.    However, in essence, this year is all over.  My locker has been cleaned out, my exams are done, my grades are practically done... it's a unique feeling, one which I haven't experienced in years past.  I don't know why, but it just is.  One thing's for certain, this SENIOR is gonna have a kick-ass summer, Doerman or not.  That's about the only thing I DO know.  Bwa ha ha.   They made up their minds And they started packing They left before the sun came up that day An exit to eternal summer slacking But where were they going without ever knowing the way?  They drank up the wine, And they got to talking They now had more important things to say And when the car broke down they started walking But where were they going without ever knowing the way?  Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold And it's always summer, they'll never get cold They'll never go hungry They'll never grow old and gray... You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere They won't make it home but they really don't care They wanted the highway, they're happier there today... today...  The children woke up And they couldn't find them They left before the sun came up that day They just drove off and left it all behind them But where were they going without ever knowing the way?  Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold And it's always summer, they'll never get cold They'll never go hungry They'll never grow old and gray... You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere They won't make it home but they really don't care They wanted the highway, they're happier there today... today...

        '05 BITCH!!!     Song in head:  Under Pressure - Queen  Current Mood:  Mixed Reactions...  I tell ya... this day is KILLA!!  It feels so glorious to be a SENIOR, and it's like all cool and shit... and... yeah.  My grades are in good enough shape that I don't have to worry about exams in the least, and... it's just a good day.  There's only one hang up in this joint, and it's quite minor, I do declare.   Many interesting stories... and so little time to tell them.  I have to be in Metero in 12 minutes, so I have to be rather brief.  Did get some good news though, Dr. B will be coming back next year part time to teach Physics B, because they couldn't find another even half-qualified person to cover it for him... It'll be kinda good for him, I reckon.  He still gets to retire, essentially, because he'll only be working for 7-8 bells per week (relative to 35 now).  The best part is that he will be able to attend graduation in May.    I came late to school this morning, because, as if getting home after work last night at 0045hrs wasn't enough, my mama's b/f decided that we were gonna have a nice 45 minute convo about modern retail business in the Cincinnati area... A great conversation it was, and very interesting, but... I needed to take a shower and go to bed!  Long and short, I didn't get to sleep until 0215... so I was not surprised at waking up at 0750 this morning... of course, I didn't mind, either, because missing English--no harm, no foul.  Brad is off at a meeting for the Fine Arts Trip to London next year, and my crush is off galavanting somewhere... Even her best bud was looking for her... So, I come to the computer lab, to vent my good mood, and have it radiate to the millions of people all across the globe who use the internet.    "I've pushed every single button, except one... And I want you to push it.  That one right there." *pushes button* *elevator rapidly rises* "I sure hope we can get up enough speed!" "Why?  Where are we going?  Up?!?" "That's right; up and out!" "But this room is made of glass!  We'll shatter to pieces!" "There's only one way to find out!" *crashes through roof* *floats over English town* "I want you to have the factory, Charlie..."   There is one place I know, Filled with true and pure imagination... If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it... Anything you want to, do it...  Wanna change the world?  There's nothing to it...

        This Year's Scholar...     Song in head:  Gone to Movies - Semisonic  Current Mood:  Artistic  Alan sat in the school's library, flicking a pencil up and down, up and down.  There it went; Up. Down. Up. Down.  The boredom he was experiencing now rivaled that of watching a freshly painted wall age and become dry, like all the rest.  He sat patiently as he watched the "premier" members of his graduating class walk up to receive their prestigious awards and scholarships.  It was the end of Junior Year, and the one common goal for everyone here was college (it was, after all, a college-prep school).  He had been nominated for one of these awards, but failed to return his resume... He chuckled as he thought of that one.  Relative to all of these people, Alan paled in comparison, he thought.  9 out of every 10 had a 3.9 GPA or above--a feat that was neither one of Alan's goals, nor an asset in his posession.  As yet another award was handed out to some wanna-be valedictorian, he sat and pondered, and thought about his life.    So many things had gone wrong for him, ever since day one.  He was raised in such a sheltered environment that he didn't have a social life, and, until not 12 months earlier, didn't know what one was.  He was a loner, of sorts--the guy who was the generally silent, mysterious person that no one really knew.  Yet, at the same time, he wasn't like others--no one perceived him as a "Columbine type"--the kind of guy who was so fucked-up that he would bring a machine gun to school.  He whistled as he walked through the hallway for some reason or another; the reasons why, even he could not fathom.  Yet, this happy self was only a front that those at school saw, and it was present nowhere else.    As Rick Rick Wolfe was given his award and applause echoed in the domed library, Alan thought more about himself.  He had no interest in these people here, and had been forced to come to the event by his retiring Physics teacher.  Alan watched as some of the other kids from his class passed their yearbooks to each other to sign.  He envied this, in a way.  It wasn't foreign to him, but somehow, Junior year had been one of his most socially reserved since 7th grade.  He knew practically nobody, it seemed.  This year, he didn't even have the money to buy the yearbook, so no one could sign it even if they wanted.  He wondered why he wasn't himself here--what was it about these familiar, 78-year old walls that brought his happy side to the foreground, and sent his dark depression hiding within the depths of his heart?  He waffled over many solutions.  The most prominent to him was the fact that he has a reputation to uphold.  Especially now--reputation was oh, so important.  Alan, towards the end of this year, had developed a sort of crush over this one particular girl--Jane, for sake of conversation.  Jane was the kind of girl that every guy in his class had a crush on at one point or another, it seemed.  She posessed a certain beauty that rivaled that of a supermodel, it seemed.  However, although initially attracted to her for the same reason that everyone else was, it changed over time, and Alan found her to be a pretty cool gal once he had talked to her a couple times.  Around Spring Break, he had gotten her phone number, but they never hooked up.  He was still hopeful, though, and had a week and a half to go, to continue trying.  He thought for sure that one girl couldn't change his entire aura though--could she?  "The Northwestern University Book Award is given to students who demonstrate exemplary academic achievement, while also displaying a keen mastery of foreign language...."  The guest professor droned at the microphone.  Alan cracked a joke at the guy who won, and the people at his table laughed, but Alan was still deep-entrenched in thought.  After the ceremony, it was lunch time, and Alan caught up with one of his friends Mark, with whom he shared a locker, and ate lunch every day.  He and Mark talked about lots of things--mostly random in nature.  Guy stuff, predominantly--college basketball, the new track that the school was building next year, the girls walking across the lunchroom, etc... it was a typical conversation, of sorts.  Alan wasn't totally there, though--he was still stuck on himself--on why he never made it with this one chick, and why he was so poor, and how his family was so dysfunctional, and how he didn't go to Prom, and how he still needed to ask out Jane, or else he would never live with the curiosity of whether or not he would have gotten a "Yes" out of her.  Although the end of the year was exciting, it was also depressing Alan.  All that he thought was so dear for so long, simply seemed to be gone within six months... his life was an ever-changing sphere of irrationality, filled with sorrow and glee, happiness and depression, love and hate, regret and ambition.  He remembered something that was said by a girl he used to like "I am just one big contradiction...  The theme about me is that I have no theme."   As his life began shifting again, as it seemed to do every 6-7 months, Alan wondered what new experiences would roll around this time--which ones he would regret leaving behind, and which ones he would welcome with open arms.  For him, it seemed, it was all in the luck of the cards.

       Now the rain comes down the windows and it  Drops onto the forehead of the waiting boy. He surveys his rental kingdom And he wonders if he's really lost his one joy.  Another fool would go out to the only place She ever went to lose herself. She's gone to the movies now, and she don't need your help.  Now the rain turns into snowfall as the City sky reflects the silver street below. And it covers up the cars, and the Wall- Flowers CD ended half an hour ago.  Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow And drive to find the show; She's gone to the movies now, and she's not coming home. She's gone to the movies now, and she's not coming home.  Now he looks around his place and anyways There's nowhere she could sit beside the bed. And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow, Or he'll have to take the bus instead.  Any other fool would be out on the roadway Trying to spot her rusted Pontiac; She's gone to the movies now, and she's not coming back. She's gone to the movies now, and she's not coming back.

        For the Very First Time...     Song in head:  It Feels Like the First Time - Foreigner  Current Mood:  ????  I had a sort of "breakthrough" on the way home from Starbucks this evening.   For the first time, ever, I believe, I found my life an enjoyable thing to look at--and not by comparing it with worse shit (e.g.:  "I don't have it bad... at least I didn't get my face burned off in a car accident).  It was good all on it's own... I could sit back, and know that I'll be raking in about $330 within the coming week, that summer is coming, that I have a great job, that I'm finally rid of the fucking politics at the black hole, I have some of the best friends that anyone could ask for, I'm about to be a SENIOR, I got a 1430 on the SAT and I'm in the top 25% of my class (80 out of 325 - but there was an error in my transcript... it may be higher).  So, all I need to make my life complete is to make something more out of those mysterious seven digits, and the surrounding bits of semi-controversey.  The coolest part of all this?  It's never happened before... I've never looked at my life, and said "Damn, I got it good."  NEVER.  EVER!!!  I'm happy for once... it's great--and I didn't even need drugs, alcohol, or sex to do it.  So, I go on looking at today and tomorrow, with my head turned skyward.  I have that glimmer of hope... I  will  have a savings; I  will  get into any college I want; I  will  rise above the lowly stance of my background; I  will  go on a date with that girl, even if I have to do something drastic.  It's all so grand.  And what do I have to say?  Put that back in your place, bitch!  Eat shit while you're there too!  I am a SENIOR in three days.  Boo yah!  Bwa ha ha ha ha!!!!!!  I would climb any mountain, Sail across a stormy sea, If that's what it take me, baby, To show how much you mean to me. And I guess it's just the woman in you That brings out the man in me I know I can't help myself You're all in the world to me...  It feels like the first time It feels like the very first time It feels like the first time It feels like the very first time  I have waited a lifetime Spent my time so foolishly But now that I've found you Together we'll make history And I know it must be the woman in you That brings out the man in me I know I can't help myself You're all the eyes can see...  It feels like the first time Like it never did before It feels like the first time Like we've opened up the door Feels like the first time Like it never will again, Never again!!!  It feels like the first time It feels like the very first time!  Open up the door! Won't you open up the door!  It feels like the first time, It feels like the very first time, It feels like the first time, It feels like the very first time, It feels like the first time, It feels like the very first time!!!

        The Strangest of Places...     Song in head:  New York Minute - The Eagles  Current Mood:  Tired  Today has been interesting so far.  I woke up late this morning, about 0740.  Got ready and to school by 0825, the start of second bell.  I missed English, which I'm not sure if I'm happy about or not, for several reasons, including academics.  German was so fudging useless... I swear.  Oh well, it will last for a limited time only as of this point.  In Physics, we watched a film about the Manhattan Project, and I had to use my Study Hall to go and make up a math quiz (on limits and derivatives) that I missed due to AP's.  Ms. King forgot about it, so I was sitting in the room for 30 minutes before she even came back... fat bitch.  Oh well, I think I did well on it, so alles gute.  Astronomy holds a test over stars and constellations, and then Math, where we are still finished with all material, like we have been for the past  two weeks!   So, that's kinda pointless.  Maybe another cool discussion in Gruder's class--I hope so.  That would be a nice end for the day.    Of course, a premature end indeed, as I will be heading off to work from 3-9 this evening--John helped me to be able to pull some extra hours--they were short.    But as for me, it's lunch time now, and the Baldwins are giving me the evil eye, so I'm off.  TTYL

        Whatever...     Song in head:  Brandy (You're A Fine Girl) - Looking Glass  Current Mood:  Hopeful  The AP Physics Exam went okay, I believe.  Probably a 3 or 4.  Not shabby, if I say so myself.  We're going to watch "The Manhattan Project" in Physics and "Dr. Strangelove" in History coming up, now that there really is nothing to work for.  I still haven't decided whether or not I'm happy with getting back into the rut tomorrow.  The past five days have been kinda cool, not having a full day of class.  However, work will still be work, and school will still be school--such is life.  The next three weeks should prove to be kinda neat.  Prom is on Saturday, and I don't suppose I'm going.  I really just don't want to.  I'd rather mutually skip it, and go on a date or something.  Dances aren't my style, you know?  Plus, then I'd be able to get the REM, which I really want.  Bleh.    Caught up with Micah today.  That was a lot of fun.  It was nice to catch up, since we haven't talked in a while.  Plus, I got a free footlong... you really can't beat that now, can you?  Summer is coming, and I'm very excited.  It will be different than any other summer before, and it will signal the coming of SENIOR year, which is another exciting phenomena.  Hopefully my new job will permit me to save up some money, so that I can take some trips over the summer.  I may just renig on my acceptance to DC.  I don't have the $300, and I'm not sure that I want to go.  My days at CMC are numbered, and limiting influence and importance doesn't sound like a bad plan.  I want to go back to Chicago, and stay for a couple weeks.  I think that would be fun.  All in all, it all seems promising, I reckon.    Well, that's all for now... I suppose I'm outta this joint.  Peace outside.

        What the fuck!     Song in head:  Baba O'Reiley - The Who  Current Mood:  Mixed  As a result of rigorous testing about to be administered by the College Board on Monday, May 10, 2004 at 1200 hrs, I have officially entered "Physics Mode."  Thus, there is a relative need from this frame of reference to begin multi-tasking... Hence, tonight's entry will be related to formulas and relationships in Physics.  If you don't get it, find a Serway and start reading.  If you don't want the deep psycho-babble, or find it over your head, then skip to the heading that says "Other stuff"    (rho)=M/V => Density = Mass / Volume   Density is an interesting study.  It is a very simple concept, relating to the number of particles per unit area within a particular substance.  All matter in the liquid and solid states have a constant density for that state... Gases have a variable density.  Well, people seem to function in a similar manner--certain people seem to be more dense than others, and they are always dense (as opposed to variably and relatively dense).  It continues to amaze me how some people just can't grasp certain topics... like respect, privacy, trust, appreciation... things like that.  It's just so amazing how many people are above a certain density, and just  don't get it!   It's very odd.    PV=nRT => Ideal Gas Law (pressure varies jointly as the number of moles and the temperature; and inversely as volume)   The Ideal Gas Law combines the work of many Chemists who pioneered the formation of the common gas laws.  In life, though... it just goes to show you how many people are pressured into doing things that they don't want to do--they may be confined, or driven into a corner; or things may get too heavy or hot to handle on their own.  Both of these instances would increase the pressure on someone to do something in particular.  This, I think, would justify the reasons why so many people do things that they don't really want to do... they are  pressured  into them for one reason or another.  This is embodied mostly in peer pressure, which serves as a prime example to this phenomena.    Q=mC~T => Heat=mass x specific heat x change in temp.   This equation simply states that heat is proportional to mass, the specific heat (a constant varying by material), and the change in temperature.  Thus, the amount of energy you put into something, the type of venture it is, and how far it goes along all affect the total heat that venture contains (and hence--the more you get burned if that heat is no longer contained)  Imagine a fast-food job... If you pour your heart and soul into it, but it's not a career, and you don't get too much out of it, then when you get fired or laid off, it really doesn't hurt as much as if this was your life-long dream career, and it was paying you a nice six-figure salary.  A relationship (romantic or friend-wise) would certainly bear a very high specific heat, and hence you can either be confident about it, and give it your all; or you can be scared of getting burned, and not give it much at all (protecting your scared pussy-ass).  Or... you can use this strategically--use the heat to get stuff you want, but wear a heat shield--so that the other person is caught off guard, and gets 3rd degree burns, while you walk away without a scratch... that's clever, but downright nasty.    (emf)=Blv => Electric potential = strength of magnetism x length of wire x velocity of particles in the magnetic field   This is a nice one--think of two people, of opposite sexes.  Now, if they are really attracted to each other (strong magnetism), and they have known each other for a long time (length), and they are moving through the motions pretty fast (velocity), then the potential of them "getting it on" is pretty damn high... (Electric potential is voltage--FYI)  However, take away the magnetic field (e.g. one of the parties is gay) and there is no potential.  So--although emf is present in many situations, it is not a problem generally.  The problem lies in the people who don't show an interest in anything but the emf.  These, my friends, are sluts.    x=v0t+½at² => distance = (initial velocity x time) + (½ x acceleration x time²)   This is one of Newton's equations of motion... it's simple if you think about it, and look at the units (I won't explain).  However... let's again look at two people, but a freindship this time.  Let's have distance symbolize the quality, or magnitude of this friendship (negative values permitted for people who dislike each other).  Now, if the velocity sybolizes the quality of the time that the two friends spend together, and this time represents the previous length of the friendship, then people who have been friends for a long time and hang out a lot are going to be pretty tight.  The second part of the equation relates to acceleration--if the two friends are starting to hang out more and more, and are doing more fun stuff, progressively, then this creates an even tighter bond.  Combine the two, and you have an equation for best friends.  However, this also applies to negative relationships--two people who dislike each other don't have good quality time, so the first half of the equation is zero, or if their time together ends in arguments, or likewise disasters, then there is a negative value.  Furthermore, if they hate each other more as they are around each other more, then the quality of their friendship is accelerating in the negative direction.  This would merit some fixing before one of the two parties locates an uzi from the back of a black van in OTR.      Other Stuff...   Now that I've fulfilled my studying requirement, and actually found out some interesting oddities of how Physics relates to life (and describes it), I'll talk a little about some stuff.  I'm really enjoying my job at Wendy's--it seems very promising, and definitely worth the money.  My days appear even more numbered at the museum, which is arousing some surprise, but not much.  It's a long time coming.  I'm pretty pissed that I seem to have lost what I used to consider two of my best friends--I don't really care whose fault it is, but I just don't like to lose friends... it's a shitty feeling, even if you do come to believe them to be total bastards or whatever for one reason or another.  A friendship is a special bond between two people, and it's also a bond which is human to crave and cherish.  I'm not crazy with that, and I know it.  (Relating it to physics... that's kinda odd, sure... but the concept is normal.)  I'm also in the process of chasing a complete goddess, who seems to be even more of an "interesting study" than I am--imagine that.  In a way, it's all a game, but with high stakes--like Q=mC~T. ;-)  Prom is this Saturday, and I still don't know if I'm going.  It depends on Mom paying the $$.  Also, the REM is out, and I have no $$ to pay for it.  If it came down to it, I'll probably skip the fucking prom--I have no date, and I have a hunch that my particular interest isn't going either.  What a mess.  Life has thrown a curveball, and I'm hoping not to strike out--even if I don't get a HR, maybe at least a double or single.  Yumm...   One of these nights, One of these crazy old nights, We're gonna find out pretty mama, What turns on at night.  The full moon is calling, The fever is hot, And the wicked wind whispers and moans, You've got your demons, And you've got desires, But I've got a few of my own...  Oooo... Someone to be kind to, In between the dark and the light, Oooo... coming right behind you, Swear I'm gonna find you, One of these nights!  One of these days, One of these lost and lonely dreams now, We're gonna find one, One that really screams.  I've been searching for the daughter of the Devil himself, I'm been searching for an angel and wife, I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both, And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight.   Oooo... Loneliness will find you, In between the wrong and the right,  Oooo... coming right behind you, Swear I'm gonna find you, One of these nights!  One of these nights, In between the dark and the light, Coming right behind you, Swear I'm gonna find you, Getcha baby one of these nights.  One of these nights...

        Service Excellence...     Song in head:  Amish Paradise - Weird Al Yankovic  Current Mood:  Happy  Today was a good day.  English wasn't pointless after all, we watched a film in German, and I feel that I did very well on the Physics test over Nuclear Physics.  Left school at 1015, then realized that I left my uniforms at home... thus, I went home to get them, and took some dough out of the bank for gas.  I was happy to get it for $1.839... that's so sick... I remember gas being high when it was over $1.00 per gallon... *curses OPEC*  I left the house, then went to Starbucks to complete the 1996 APUS Test.  I did very well on it, especially relative to the 2001 test that we took in class.  Something like a 52 on the 1996 one, I believe.  (This is out of 80)... Essentially that's good enough to skip all of the essays and get a 2 on the exam.  I'm happy, and I'll review a little more tonight before the exam tomorrow.  Ran into Kathy at Old Navy, but got out of her hair so she could work.  Went up to West Chester to the B&N out there to do my practice essay.  Got most of it done... maybe 15 mins tops to finish now.  That's all due tomorrow morning.  AP Breakfast is tomorrow morning at 0645, and I have a second REM interview at 0700... APUS Exam begins at 0730.  Mom said she'll agree to give me an early dismissal for tomorrow.  AP Party at Ault Park at 1600 on Friday, which I have to miss.  I was really looking forward to it, but I have to work 17-20.  :-(    Speaking of... I had a great time for my first day.  Watched the silly training videos for about 1.5 hrs, then got trained on the grill, which was pretty cool.  It's one of the more-complicated jobs, and I had fun with it.  It's a bit of a relief--I was pretty worried about this one.  But, it looks like it's gonna be going pretty good.    AP Physics exam on Monday... It begins at 1200, so I'll be going in for it and nothing else.  Which, essentially, means no school until Tuesday.  That's kinda cool.  All in all, a good day.  I'm pleased, indeed.

        I Hate That Man... He's the Worst Teacher Ever...     Song in head:  Under Pressure - Queen  Current Mood:  I was happy, but now I'm kinda sick (*curses chicken*)  Upon examination of my calendar, I have noticed that there are several important things happening in exactly 4 weeks:  there are two deadlines, and getting out of school--all of this while on my birthday... yay me.  You know... I'm sick of this vague shit... I'm gonna speak damn it, and I'm not gonna omit any fucking names.  So... today was kinda cool.  We had a free day in English, which meant that the two shy people (namely Megan and I) could take 20 of the 50 minutes deciding whether or not we wanted to talk to each other, 15 of the remaining 30 figuring out what to say, and the last bit actually getting some sort of conversation going.  Of course, I may be capitalizing on a big nothing--I have been known to do that.  However, it's something granting me hope.  Reciprocated interest is now one thing that I'm not worrying about so much.  Now for the next step.  Nonetheless, our mostly meaningless small-talk ranging in topics from "Is that a history project?" to Dr. Burgess (which... the quote in the subject line is hers, mind you) but was still entertaining amidst a roomfull of idiots.  I look onward.  The Frau was out today, so German was kinda fun.  Tim, Scovanner, and I were devising "exit pranks," like sticking a pound of beef down the hole in the wall before school lets out (so that the room will ultimately reek come August).  Physics was a lecture on Geiger Counters, and sorting absence notes in the office.  Astronomy was a free bell, where Burgess told me to get "boned-up" on the Main Sequence of nearby stars.  (Sorry Megan, but he's a riot).  Pre-Cal was nearly pointless, excepting that I did Physics review.  History was fun, and we've hit the "kickback" phase, where we don't really do anything too intensive and relax.  I'm looking forward to the exam.  Mostly because of the two early dismissals I'll get, along with the free pancakes and the party in Ault Park in the afternoon.  Grunder had one for the record books:  "When the po-po rolls up, I'm just an innocent man, enjoying the weather, having some lunch... me and my weight problem... and all these hooligans came out of nowhere!"  After school was uneventful... Tracked board donations at Habitat, and did a new spread, amidst doing the Accounts Payable and incoming mail.  It was kinda fun.  Came home and did some chores--mom was late due to Dubya rolling through town.  Had some dinner, and mom asked me to hit on Grunder for her... *ew*  I had to come up with some bad qualities really fast in order for her to shut off the libido.  *more ew*  Ah yes... to my darling Kathleen.... Although I wasn't quite so flattered by "problematic friend," I think it would be interesting to know just what "B-Dawg" told you to do... Maybe drop me like a rock?  You know, I'm not making the move to fix this, and I'm not going to.  If I'm someone important, you better say something, because I've done enough talking to last me a good while.  If I'm not, then I understand.  Seeing as how so much is so clear now, you're really gonna have to do some convincing... something more than a brief vague journal reference like "problematic friend."  I feel justified in my course of action, and I don't intend on changing it... therefore, you officially have possession of the ball.  Whether you choose to toss it, shoot it, deflate it, or suck on it, it's your choice.  To be honest, I don't think you read this thing, so you may never even see it.  Either case, it works out.  And for Kathy's humor if no-one else's, it's the Leo Moon, right?   Strenghts:  Quick mind and fertile imagination; flair for creative self-expression; optimistic and enthusiastic disposition; ability to stand up for the best without oppressing inferiors; friendly and spirited sense of fun and adventure which inspires others and keeps you ever popular.   Weaknesses:  Your need for flatter and to hold center-stage; childlike haughtiness and stubbornness which surfaces when you feel  unappreciated ; extrovert tendency to spend so much energy socializing that you fail to develop your abilities to their fullest.

        Now That I've Spilled Cheese All Down My Ass... It's Pissing Me Off...     Song in head:  One Last Breath - Creed (and the rest of JM#4)  Current Mood:  Relatively Pleased  Today has been different than most Sundays, for several reasons:  --I had a full night's rest--in fact, more than that at 12 hours.  I also woke up at 0915, which was nice.  I was able to take a shower and do some stuff before heading off to work.  I also got there 50 mins early.  --My bitterness, although still popping out, was a bit more contained than usual.  --I was able to leave work, not only with a feeling of having accomplished something, but having hard evidence that I did--I typed demo descriptions for all of the flatboat toys, and cranked out The Inside Track.  --I didn't sit in one place doing nothing all day (which ties into the productivity bit).  --I didn't do much talking at all, except to Linda and Garland (and the visitors, of course).  --I didn't go to Starbucks on my lunch break (which I took at 1300 instead of 1230).  --Everyone who I came in contact with either pictured me as an okay guy, or as a dickhead, it seems.  Not much in the middle.  --I left alone.  --I drove 63 on the way to Kenwood, which was very relaxing, since I could use cruise control.  You wouldn't believe how much different the straigtaway at Dana Ave. looks when you're going the speed limit (or closer to it).  It was nice to practically sit back and let the car take me where I needed to go.  The hand motions were instinctive now--I've made the drive so many times.  --Kathy was both at home and "awake," which is different than the past few weeks.  --I voluntarily cleaned the kitchen after dinner.  --The day ended with ice cream, which was thoroughly enjoyable.    --I got home, and didn't have to do notecards.  It's really funny, because I honestly don't know where I'd be right now if it weren't for the people I know.  Everyone falls into their little niche and plays their role.  Some are more pleasing than others, but they all still shape who I am--and the same for everyone, I believe.    Thanks for putting up with my shit, those of you who do.  I don't know what I'd do without you.  So what's new in the life of Joe?  Not too much, I suppose.  It's time to start cracking for AP--History is on Friday, Physics on the following Monday.  It is now officially crunch time.  Prom is in less than two weeks.  I'm still in debate on whether or not I'm going to go, much less if/who I'm going to ask.  Yearbooks will be on sale soon--another $70.  *bleck*  Interview with Nick tomorrow--which means I should have a decent-paying job soon.  The scariest part?  My starting salary will be the same as if I took the job that Sandy gave me the heads up on.  Bwa ha ha.    "Risten, wound eye!"  That boy just cracks me up.  The Devil went down to Georgia, He was looking for a soul to steal,  He was in a bind, he was way behind He was looking to make a deal When he came upon this young man Sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump  And said "Boy, let me tell you what!" Well, I guess you didn't know it,  But I'm a fiddle-player too And if you care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you: Well you play a pretty good fiddle, boy But give the Devil his due, I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul That you'll think I'm better than you The boy said my name's Johnny And it might be a sin, But I'll take your bet You're gonna regret 'Cause I'm the best that's ever been!  Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia And the Devil deals the cards And if you win, you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold But if you lose, the Devil gets your soul...  The Devil opened up his case And he said "I'll start this show" And fire flew from his fingertips As he rosined up his bow And he pulled the bow across the strings And it made an evil hiss Then a band of demons joined in And it sounded something like this...  When the Devil finished, Johnny said  "Well, you're pretty good, old son, But sit down in that chair right there  And let me show you how it's done!" He played:  Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run The Devil's in the House of the Rising Sun Chicken in the breadpan, pickin' out dough Granny, does your dog bite, no, child, no...   Well, the Devil bowed his head Because he knew that he'd been beat And he laid that golden fiddle On the ground at Johnny's feet Johnny said "Devil, just come on back If you ever wanna try again But I done told you once,  You son of a bitch,  I'm the best that's ever been!" He played:  Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run Devil's in the house of the Rising sun Chicken in the breadpan picking out dough Granny, does your dog bite, no, child, no...

        This test administration is now complete.  The College Board would like to thank you for your cooperation...     Song in head:  Fields of Gold - Sting  Current Mood:   Woke up at 0600 this morning, picked up Kathleen, ate breakfast, and went to take the SAT.  Forgot my admission ticket, so met mom at White Castle to get it.  The "front door" to the school was locked, so we drove around to the Blair Circle.  Sat down next to Taylor Roberts... ick.  Received my test booklet, answer sheet, and listened to the spiel.  Started the test... I believe I did very well.  Verbal didn't give me much trouble, and math was a breeze.  I feel like I got very close to an 800 for the math sections.  Overall, maybe in the lower 14s, I'm estimating.  I'm happy.  Went to lunch at Chipotle, didn't finish my burrito, as usual.    Dropped off Kathleen, drove home.  Got my mailing from the museum.  I intend to burn it.  "What?  I never got that shit, Kristen."    Mom left.  Debated making a phone call, decided not to.  I have an evening event tonight, starting at 1700.  I don't know who I'm working with, but if it's Bennie again, or Walt, I may just scream.  In fact, I don't want to do it at all.  But, this lamoid not only needs the dough, but has nothing better to do.  Imagine that!  I've got to run to keep from hiding, and I'm bound to keep on riding.  And I've got one more silver dollar, but I'm not gonna let them catch me... No, I'm not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.  I don't own the clothes I'm wearing, And the road goes on forever, I've got one more silver dollar, but I'm not gonna let them catch me, no, I'm not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.  And I've gone by the point of caring, some old bed I'll soon be sharing.  I've got one more silver dollar, but I'm not gonna let them catch me, no, I'm not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.  I got more rolls than a pastry truck!  That line kills me every time...

        Day Off...     Song in head:  Faint - Linkin Park  Current Mood:    I got my preliminary schedule today... I'm very excited, because... it's RIGHT!  Not only is it right, but it KICKS ASS!  Get this... first bell--yearbook.  Second bell--English, with the same teacher who is the yearbook adviser.  Third Bell--walk up one flight of stairs for AP Calculus BC.  Fourth Bell--walk ten doors down the hall to Econ AP.  Lunch.  Fifth bell--Psych AP in the room directly next to my fourth bell.  Sixth bell--Ethnic Studies with Yosh, three doors down from my fifth bell.  Also, I have a 7th bell study hall all year, so I'll get to go home early, at 1335.  Tell me that my schedule doesn't kick ass?  I don't think so!  I'm just hoping that they don't change the schedule between now and August... this is just the preliminary schedule... but... the thing is--half of my classes are "one-section" courses... meaning that they are only offered for one bell a day.  e.g.:  Yearbook is only offered first bell.  Calc will only be offered 3rd bell, and Econ AP will probably only be offered 4th bell, but maybe with one other section.  Thus, there's probably only one way that they all can mesh... Bwa ha ha!  So this brings up another point... I'm actually excited to go back to school.  Granted, I've been rather enjoying the world of full-time work, but I'm dispensible.  I'm very much looking forward to going back to that which I used to call "the other hole."  (No hole can take precedence over the museum).  The cut in funding will be... eh.  But, like I said, all new experiences, and a whole lot of cool bu-junk, even if I am taking 3 AP courses, a AA English, and a course that operates at AP level difficulty.  This is shine time, and I'm pretty damn excited.  Woot woot!    So yeah... cool shiznit, yo.  Fuh-sheezy my neezy.  *wtf?*  I beat the system again!!!!

        We don't play the 'getting burned' game...     Song in head:   Freefalling - Tom Petty  Current Mood:     Chris:  This is the worst part of the day, I swear. Joe:  What? Chris:  Calling in numbers.  *picks up phone* Chris:  (on phone)  Hey Nick, Chris, Friday's numbers... cash was short... but I have gift certificates that haven't been rung in; labor was...; and waste was atrocious... we're somehow missing a case and a half of beef and two cases of chicken--you can see when you get in here, but the dollar amount is about $152.  Catch ya later. Joe:  *nearly gags*  We're losing  cases  now?!? Chris:  Oh... Mid was so much worse... Tim came up short by 2 cases of beef, 5 cases of Chicken, a bag of Spicy, 8 bags of nuggets, 3 bags of strips... This is an improvement Chris:  (calling Steph)  Waste... was ungodly.  It's a numerical disaster.  See ya.  It was a very fun night... and I think that 8-Cl is one of my favorite shifts, even if I'm called in on my day off to cover it.  *shrugs*  It was some great shit, lemme tell ya.  But yeah... I open tomorrow, and work until 5--with Nick.  Oh, it should be so much fun.  I should forget about brewing my morning java... *shrugs*  who knows?  You know, I was gonna say some stuff, but now I forget what most of it was... I mean, I could go on and on about the night, and talk about service times, and procedural flaws, and what not...  but... nah.  Anyhow... I'm off to shower and shave, that way I can wake up later tomorrow... Whee!

        I'll Just Get the "Topless Car Riding" POC out of the Office...     Song in head:   Look Away - Chicago  Current Mood:   Today, for the most part, was a good day.  Usually, on my days off, I end up with nothing to do, but it was nice to actually have some purpose for once.  I met up with John around 1345 and we went back, once again, to Caesar Creek, which we have been frequenting over the past week or so, and decided to map the mountain biking trail.  It was fun to get out into the woods again, and I had a very good time.    One of the most memorable moments was this little green Civic convertible... We're in Mason, OK, and all the sudden I see this car, and I'm trying to get a look at the girl in the passenger seat, right?  Well, all of a sudden she just takes off her shirt, and starts playing with her boyfriend's hair... they ended up going all the way up 71 to Causar Creek, and beyond.    There was nothing to see from the car--the girl decided to slouch in her seat... but still, the sheer randomness of the act, just out of nowhere, was like.. huh?  anyhow... John and I hiked the trail, then ate dinner, both slightly depressed that neither of us had such a female who would just go topless while we were driving on the highway...  So I'm like "See, now you know what you want... yo've defined a goal... Now the next step is an action plan.  For you, all you need is training... me, I have to go back a step or two."  Then there were a bunch of fast food analogies, and much laughter.  Good times.    Well, up until the Golden Corral was "too easter-like..."  I quote:  "It's so much like Easter... I feel like Jesus is gonna be resurrected any minute."    But yeah, good times.    So I come home, and... it just goes to show you how fast life or what you perceive of it can just be flipped upside down.  It's so fucking crazy.    So now it's late... and I'm typing, and... yeah.  5-10 tomorrow... fuckas.  I'm hoping to wake up around 9 or so, and get a relatively early start on the day.  Maybe drop into habitat, and, maybe a surprise stop at the local Meijer store, followed by more reading time at Coffee Emporium and/or Wendy's... life gets to be so grand sometimes... right?  I quote:  "Life moves pretty fast.  If you don't stop to look around every now and then, you just might miss it."  Okay, so maybe my plans aren't so grand... but if I don't look at them that way, then I'll be moping all day, and that isn't much more fun... so I'll take it.    No turning back now... we can only go forward.  What do we eat?  LEMONS!  Why do we eat 'em?  BECUASE WE SUCK!  My computer is running so slow, that I can outtype it... so I think that I'm gonna try agian to go to sleep.  Adieu.  "We must also keep in mind that discoveries are usually not made by one man alone, but that many brains and many hands are needed before a discovery is made for which one man receives the credit."  -Henry Sigerist

        An Interestingly Good Day...     Song in head:  Chicago CD  Current Mood:    So... Today has come and gone.  It's practically Friday now... The Skinny:  "Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head" to quote the Beatles song.    Went out, drove to Kenwood to get to the ATM, then went to Coffee Emporium to read and enjoy some fine java my droogs.  Left around 1545.  By 1600, I was on 275 when my tire blew out.  Big fun, but no problemo.  Tire changed and rolling again in 12 minutes.  Got to work around 1625, didn't start until 1700.  Nick was the salaried MID and Chris was running Ops... Although dreading this, it turned out pretty well.  Nick is still depressed like he seems to have been the past few days.  He regards me now with this air of... "I really hate that guy... but I'm the only one who does, so I have to deal with it."  We don't exactly speak to each other anymore... LOL.  Simply talk via actions.  Ms. Begley (Steph, the DM) was in to occupy most of his time, when he wasn't online.  (THAT was a strange sight--Nick online)  Nah... he went out to his car at one point, and I asked him if he was leaving, he said "No... Too bad, huh?"  I chuckled inside, because he read me like a book.      The shift went very well, though--few problems, my drawer was only plus 20 cents, all of my dishes got done, so Eugenia was ready to praise me as God.  Plus, I seem to have earned the approval of most, if not all of the staff (bar Nick, of course)  This isn't necessary, but it's nice to know.  Tim failed his service time goal last night--he barely scraped 112.  Bwa ha ha.  Chris is trying for it tonight, but I have more faith in him--Chris can pull 85 so easy... it's not even funny.  I quote:  "After 10, I don't play the 'getting burned game;' if service time is over 100, I did something really fucked up--like on Monday!"  But, aside from the tire, and the babysitter complaining to my mother about my crassness, it was a very good day.  Good coffee, good shift, time to relax and all.    Francisco:  "No 'Ay carumba?'" Joe:  "Nah!  Today's a good day!  Es muy bueno!  No ay carumba." Francisco:  *laughs viciously*  Plus, there's this:  "Unless you incur any unexpected income or expenses, the total balance of your day-to-day accounts will be $5,028.34 in 12 months."  Boo yah.

        Where the Hell Did I Think I Was?     Song in head:  Many  Current Mood:  Who knows now?  I typed a post, but it was so bleating negative... I refuse to publish it.    "Does anybody really know what time it is?  Does anybody really care?"

        "Need I Say I Care?"     Song in head:  Throwing It All Away - Genesis  Current Mood:  Huh?  Today... was a good day.  I woke up around 8-ish, got all dressed up and tried to go to the bank (doesn't open until 10).  Failing in efforts to gain money, and having a 1005 appointment downtown, I departed Price Hill and ventured eastward.    I was early downtown, so I stopped into Hathaway's for a strawberry shake.  That was so good... UDF still can't compare.    Moved to the Garfield Garage, still in my Sportcoat, and luckily found a parking spot on level 7A... Jeez.  Got to the street, walked a couple blocks, and checked in at the photo studio, exactly on time.    Spent an hour with three near-overly gorgeous 22-year-old chicks, all with the top concern of making me smile more... *refrains from further comment*  I stop by the house, and get a call from John saying that I need a sample deposit ticket for my direct deposit to go through, so I drive to West Chester.  Hang out up at Wendy's for a while, then John and I head to a coffee shop over in Sharonville.  We then went back to his house, where I fell asleep, and then went back to Wendy's... I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  I'd tell you... but, you wouldn't get it.   So, I depart and come back home... I have my refrigerated pre-packaged carrot cake, a glass of milk, and a keyboard... would you like to try that in a combo today?  Check coming in on Friday night... estimated at $500.  I'm excited.  "Woo party" as Amber would say.  Work 4-10 tomorrow, 5-10 Wed, 5-9 Thu, Friday OFF, 11-8 Saturday, 1130-4 Sunday.  28 hours... not shabby.  Considering that I'm everyone's hour-dump bitch, I would not be surprised if that went up.  Also, if I get really bored, I could do rush at Blue Ash on Thursday... I'm sure Antonio and Terry would be more than happy to see me back... LOL.  It depends on how the bits go down this week, of which this is the first day.  (In Wendy's World, all clocks are two minutes fast, all documents have to be initialed nine times, 200 seconds is an eternity, all weeks begin on Monday--and oh yeah, voids of 2.5% or cash over/short of $2.00 merits written referral)  Bwa ha ha.  I dialed the number, but fell asleep before I pressed SEND...  so close.   Need I say I love you? Need I say I care? Need I say that emotions Are something we don't share? I don't want to be sitting here Trying to deceive you 'Cause you know I know baby And I don't wanna go.  We cannot live together. We cannot live apart. That's the situation; We've known it from the start. Every time that I look at you, I can see the future. 'Cause you know I know baby And I don't wanna go.  Just throwing it all away, Throwing it all away. Is there nothing that I can say To make you change your mind? I watch the world go round and round And see mine turning upside down.  Throwing it all away. Now who will light your darkness, Who will hold your hand? Who will find you the answer, When you don't understand? Why should I have to be the one, Who has to convince you? 'Cause you know I know baby And I don't wanna go.  Someday you'll be sorry Someday when you're free Memories will remind you  That our love was meant to be Late at night when you call my name The only sound you'll hear Is the sound of your voice calling, Calling after me.  Just throwing it all away, Throwing it all away. And there's nothing that I can say... We're throwing it all away Just throwing it all away...

        What the hell?     Song in head:  Songs by Chicago that I just d/led  Current Mood:  Bored/Depressed  It's such a shame... I think that I put this into a blog entry recently... the state of affairs that I'm in.  I suppose I've hit another one of those points where the bad stuff seems too prevalent.  However, as I look at it, I've done nothing since summer started... Minus work and hang out with John.  The biggest excitement I've had recently came when I found out that I am so dangerously close to 40 hrs this week that they had to whip out the calculator to make sure it would be okay for me to stay...  I guess this is what it's like to work full time--2nd shift.  God, I hate it.  It seems like there isn't any time for anything... If I worked early I'd have the latter half of the day, and if I worked later, I'd have the earlier half... but I work generally 11-6, giving me... NOTHING!  Of course, like I said, I have really nothing better to do, so this isn't a problem, and I'm raking in beaucoup bucks... This check's predicted net is $520... which is like.... whoa.  I look back... and I'm like... this one check will be the equivalent of 5.5 months pay at CMC.  This reminds me that... they do pay me enough to put up with Nick.    The best part, is probably that I actually like my job, oddly enough.  I like the people that I work with, I enjoy what I do... I'm getting pretty good at it.  It seems so... good.  However, Mom is right about one thing--I do need to start developing other interests besides my work... I've got my mountain biking that I'm hoping to get more into--if the weather ever clears up.  I intend to go out to East Fork and Pine Creek- both were listed as really good sites by this book that I bought.   That's the other great thing... I banked exactly 50% of my check--to the penny... and I could still spend more than I've been able to since... since... days at the mall?  The sad part is the utter focus on this--the whole "work to live, live to work" attitude.  If you compound this with my bitter cynicism, it's lethal.  I'm not sure what to make of all of it... It's still all a hold-over, per se, until the real mccoy comes along, and I  really  have control over my life.  (The level to which I have control over it now is rather scary, but that's a whole separate issue).  I quote Ferris Bueller:  "Life moves pretty fast.  If you don't stop to look around every once in a while, you just might miss it."    I have to call her... damn it.  Maybe if I clean my room, I'll feel a tad better... that's something with purpose, right?   As I was walking down the street one day, a man came up to me and asked me what the time was that was on my watch, yeah... I said "Does anybody really know what time it is?  Does anybody really care?"  If so I can't imagine why; we've all got time enough to cry...  I was walking down the street one day, a pretty lady looked at me and said her diamond watch had stopped all day, and I said "Does anybody really know what time it is?  Does anybody really care?"  If so I can't imagine why we've all gottime enough to cry...  I was walking down the street one day, being pushed and shoved by people trying to beat the clock, oh, no, I just don't know...   --Chicago

        SUBJECT LINE     Song in head:   Current Mood:   So the grill guy says to the pan, "I need something, but I don't know what..."  and the pan says "I'll tell ya what you need, Joe, is some nice, red meat."  So Joe's like... "Hey, that sounds good.  I'll take it!"  The pan, though, tells the great grill guy "It's gonna cost ya..."  Rather than ask what, Joe just beats the pan's ass... there is a loud clattering noise as plastic lids and stainless steel collide furiously.  In the end, the poor defenseless pan is taken aback by the grill guy and says "Ahhh... you can have all the meat you want... anything but the PowerSoak..."  Desperately trying to avoid being sent to the jacuzzi-like dishwasher, the pan surrendered its hold over the precious red meat, allowing it to fall into the greasy hands of the evil grill guy... *cue music*  And the grill guy realizes that he does not really want red meat, but that it will sell, sell, SELL!  He wants to make a profit, and, like any large corporation, doesn't care the means of getting there.  Hence, the grill guy tortured the poor patties, forcing them to endure harsh, 250-degree scorching, fierce beating with a spatula, and to inhale the horrible smoke of burning chili meat.  At this point, the patties were so tortured that the cow that they used to be let out a sober "moo..." as it's ass was literally being cooked.  In the end, some Mexican shouted "Double..." or "Yoo-nyur" or something else, and the artists formerly known as patties shuffled off into the great burger heaven, as they were placed on a bun, regarded as a meal, and eaten and digested, to become something else some other time... These thoughts made the grill guy smile, despite having to rebuild the whole fucking grill after he went on break, and the hot juicy burgers magically had transformed into CHILI MEAT... *cue music again*  You can see why "Yo" summons up one phrase among our Mexican crew... "Es mucho loco."  Anyhow, it's been a good few days.  I left the museum without much ado... and I've been working a lot, and, amazingly, enjoying it, despite all the stupidity that goes down on Nick's watch... Ay yi yi... E.G.  (10:25 - store opens in 5 minutes) NICK:  Everyone grab your keys! UNISION:  Huh? NICK:  We're not parking at the store anymore during lunch rush... too many wasted parking spots UNISON:  *shake head* NICK:  See, if we have 18 people on lunch rush, then that's at least 15 cars that are in our parking lot... we dont' have many spaces.  The more people we can get in, the more food we're gonna sell.  So everyone get in your cars and follow me over to the high school!  Yes, my friends, our GM takes people BEFORE they clock in, and forces them to drive over to Lakota West High School and park their cars, only to ride back in a stupid blue Mustang, and drive back to their cars in 3 hours... And yes, Nick is driving.  *shudders*  Somtimes, people are dumb enough to scare me.  By the way, he didn't ask the high school if we could park there either... Who cares, eh?  But yeah... work has been pretty fun the past few days... I guess because I'm starting to learn the tricks and get on top of my game.  I've started to do rush shifts, which entails a whole new ball game, but still kinda fun.  I'm being loaned to Blue Ash tomorrow--they need help for lunch, and it was a way for Nick to get out of rearranging the schedule so that I would be working more than 2.5 hrs in a shift.  It should be... interesting.  But I did get my paycheck... got to bank half of it, which was nice.  Got a Visa Buxx card too, so now I've got some plastic to play with... whee!  But, sadly, that... is all I have.  *shrugs*  It's money, right?

        Isn't it Over Yet?     Song in head:  The Wall - Pink Floyd  Current Mood:  ???  "It's his last day... Work him hard!"  --Linda  Well, that solves the mystery of who let the cat out of the bag.  For being a last day, this sucks.  The 1940s LHW is today, so there's actually stuff needing done.  I don't intend to do much of it at all, but, you know.  Staff coverage is actually less than normal, counting out the presence of Lee, Darla, Jason, and Krista.  *chuckles*  Fucking morons.  I'm still wondering how I'm gonna get my pay stubs from this shit hole... Don got rid of my mailbox already.  Kill him.  Like Nick, he is worth it.  Kathleen will be here... oh joy.  Lemons for her, damn it.  Not long at all now, I reckon, within five hours... it will all be over.  Not too shabby if I do say so myself.

        What to write...     Song in head:  The Last Resort - The Eagles  Current Mood:  Unsure  I step back and I look at life sometimes.... every now and then, I just don't get it.  Of course, that's rather vague, but it's intentional.  If it's more vague, then it can apply to more crap.     Work, for instance, is like that.  A conversation with Melissa (one of the Asst. Mgrs.) sums it up pretty well.  A guy called me to work for him on Wednesday, which, aside from Sunday, was my only scheduled day off this past week.  So Melissa told Ricky that he would have to pick up my Saturday so that I wouldn't be working 6 days in a row.  Well, Ricky neglected to mention that.  I came in on Wednesday, and Melissa told me about that, then said that she'd call Ricky to make him work the Saturday.  I told her not to, and that I would work the Saturday.  She gave me a rather confused stare... then said "You really want to work six days in a row?"  I replied "Well, I don't want to, no, but I need as much money as possible."  Oddly enough, that little conversation has put a lot of things back into perspective.  I realized that there's yet another aspect of my childhood that I missed out on--the reason that all these teens call off constantly is that they don't like to work... but they don't absolutely NEED every dime they can get their hands on... they work to get spending cash.  I've never had a job like that... not getting a paycheck was never a nuisance, it was a catastrophic event.  It's like at the museum, when JOC used to cancel evening events, then tell Linda that the ppl working should be happy that they don't have to come in... and Linda would slap them in the face and tell them that they hated events getting canceled, because they needed the hours...  Fuckers.  So, as I sit here chilling, enjoying some time off before Day 5 of 6 begins at 1700, I still keep thinking.  Like staying until close last night, despite getting off at 2200.  I was drop dead tired.  In all reality, I wanted to go home, but I didn't want to go to  this  home.  As I said to John:  "I've got this (Wendy's) or I've got home... and this is beating the fuck out of going home."  There's nothing to do here, and the atmosphere just radiates negativity... It's just a reminder of how truly shitty my life is.    Then you throw in the whole girl situation, or lack thereof.  That's a whole other department.   The good thing:  That doesn't usually bother me.  I've been caught on several occasions thinking my life was the grandest thing on the planet.  Like I said before:  Every now and then I get put back into perspective, but it's rare anymore....  Maybe because I'm always working.  I just go back to the grand master plan... and find some hope.  I know that I have to get through now to get to tomorrow, so it's bearable.  Hence why I'm still breathing.  Positives:  I'm gonna get a prepaid credit card.  That'll be nice to have around for crap like online purchases and gas and such.    I pulled off 33 hours this past week.  Paychecks go through tonight.  Money is due for the REM Conference at OU today.... only $35.   Singing up to a Capulet, On a balcony in your mind...

        Well, Happy fucking Birthday... NOW GET THE FUCK OUT!     Song in head:  Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow - Fleetwood Mac  Current Mood:  *Mixed*  I haven't updated my blog in a little while, i suppose... I've been rather busy.  I could personify my website... and apologize for neglecting it, but that's too bitch-like.    It's definitely been an interesting few days... School is out.  Work is going well, went camping yesterday--which was lots of fun, despite numerous problems encountered.    My birthday was today.  Woo party.    Work was fun, actually.  No one knew it was my birthday, which I had expected.   I was gonna type a bunch of quotes from the night... but... nah.

Song in head:  Cheers Theme - Phish  Current Mood:  mostly tired  So, yearbook camp was great, and I had lots of fun, as well as many new stories...&nbsp; Oh yeah, they're hella good.&nbsp; But alas, after 2 hours of sleep the night before the trip, and only six the first night, and none last night, mixed in with the 3 hr drive back to Cincy from Athens, and the 1hr drive back home from Walnut, I believe that I will hit the sack.

        Fucked up?&nbsp; What?!?&nbsp; Nothing is fucked up, so long as you can start from scratch!     Song in head: &nbsp;Just You 'N' Me&nbsp;- Chicago  Current Mood:  Damn you, Jennifer...  So, I go to look at my blog, and since I had decided to switch to the new Blogger-powered commenting system, and abandon good ole Haloscan, my entire blog got fucked up... So, I just picked a new template, and did some minor modifications... Damned bastards wrote it in XML so I had to reteach myself shit just in order to throw in some links... Ay yi yi...  But alas, all is good now, and, in fact, I kinda like this setup better... I do need to ditch the Jobu line... but.. you know.  Today was an interesting day at work... For more details on the fast food part--see the other blog   urlLink Life in Quick Service . &nbsp; Otherwise, it was kinda nice, for a Sunday--I was pleasantly surprised by a few different things and stuff was pretty cool on the whole, however, it was still a Sunday, and Sundays suck ass.&nbsp; People are indecisive, service times are through the roof, and we're never properly staffed for the flow, because it's so unpredictable.  Furthermore, our store is having some "crew issues" over the past week... We've got 3 ppl that we just refused to give hours to for one reason or another--one because he mouthed off to Tara, another because he's always high, another because... Well, Ricky... Ricky just sucks.&nbsp; To further complicate problems, we've had problems even with the Mexicans on attendance...and... it's just bad.&nbsp; It's kinda good for me, because I pick up the slack hours, but... meh.  In non-work related news, the trip to OU is begins at 730 on Tuesday morning... I am excited.&nbsp; Now if I can just get all the shit that I need for the trip and still manage to do enough of this fucking summer reading... ay yi yi.  But yes, I work again tomorrow 1130-8--another marvelous mid.&nbsp; However, four days off following!!!  Whee!  In some cool news... projected Net for next check is $521.97... Bwa ha ha!

        But Alas, Life Still Sucks...     Song in head:  We Will Rock You -- Queen  Current Mood:  Bored  So I have a day off today, for the first time in the past eight days... And, as I predicted, I'm bored as all fuck.&nbsp; I slept in until 10, then bought the new phone that I've been meaning to buy for... at least a few months now.&nbsp; It's pretty damn cool if you ask me--It actually  tells  me who is calling when they call, and you can download new ringers for it and shit like that... but this is a house phone mind you, not a cell phone.&nbsp; I like it, and it's one of the fruits of my fulltime labor, in my opinion.&nbsp; Lord knows, Mom even refused to buy it, so it's my money.&nbsp;   So yeah... Here I am once again... fuck it.

        It's A Story... Of&nbsp;A&nbsp;Lovely Lady...  &nbsp;   Song in head:  Midnight Rider  Current Mood:&nbsp;  Insomnia &nbsp; So here I am again... It's so late at night, that it isn't night anymore, and, as Chris would say "I find myself going to bed when the sun is coming up, and not waking up until the day is already gone."&nbsp; It was that way today... I slept until I felt like waking up, which originally was noon, but became 230... The day was gone... and I had to be at work by 5.&nbsp; Now, of course, the whole sleep cycle is fucked up, and I'll be lucky if I can get to sleep again before 6 AM before I have to leave for OU in a week and a half.&nbsp; It's only 5 now, but i know damn well that I won't be able to get to bed until 6... so what the fuck is the point in sleeping?&nbsp; For all that I preach to John about needing rest, maybe I should look at my own situation...&nbsp; I can't sleep either, as awkward as it sounds... Oh well, at least I'm only working  full-time , not full-time  plus ten hours. &nbsp; I also never have to open, which is good for this sleep habit, but bad for me fixing it.  &nbsp; This is where the problem lies... I have nothing to do with my life... I sleep, then I work, then repeat... throw in the oddball dinner out or coffee outing, maybe a hike every 2-3 weeks or something... There is nothing else.&nbsp; The little time that I have during the daylight hours doesn't come in large enough increments to do anything (as if I would do anything useful with it anyhow) and the remaining time is after I get off work, where I come home, and do random crap before sleeping.&nbsp; There's nothing to go out and do, because everything is closed... so i'm stuck in the house--this eerie, creepy hole.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So, in essence... my time is  wasted .&nbsp; I'm doing stuff that I don't even want to be doing, but I'm only doing it because I lack something better to do... For example, when I can't sleep, I'll throw on a movie... the only movies I have are my old VHS tapes... most of which predate puberty&nbsp; (back when money in this house actually used to be spent).&nbsp; I've watched all of the films that I have... some of them twice, three, or four times.... I can practically read you the script of the Langoliers off the top of my head.&nbsp; I hate this. &nbsp; This is what I have become, at least for the summer.&nbsp; I have no real purpose... no schedule consistent enough to plan around, and no plans to make, so why alter the schedule?&nbsp; I've turned into a lean, mean, saving machine... and to date, since I started Wendy's 2.5 months ago, I've banked half of every check.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, things like $400 auto repair bills and $100 loans to Mom have come out of the piggy bank... so my efforts are somewhat hidden).&nbsp; However, I was able to do that stuff, because of my dilligence... That's kinda cool, but... not really. &nbsp; So... yeah.&nbsp; Who the fuck cares?&nbsp; I'll go down for a nap at 6, wake up at 8, go off and grab some breakfast and coffee, read my book, and show up for work at 11... who gives a fuck? &nbsp; This is what happens when one becomes so contrasted, and so deep into both the realms of depression and happiness that they have no idea what half of limbo they're teetering on... That's right... insomnia.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm still searching for a purpose... there's a guarantee of a short-term one on July 27-29, and an absolute sure bet on August 15... but what's in the middle? &nbsp; Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.

        Some Things Change, But Are Always the Same...     Song in head:  It's a Hard Life - Queen  Current Mood:  Pleased  Today has been an interesting day...  for several reasons.  It's been a good kind of interesting, at least, but it had it's own little oddities, I reckon.    This was supposed to be one of my FOUR days off this week, but I'm not too sad to see it disappear.  Melissa called me this morning, frantic at 1130, wanting me to work.  I would have loved to do lunch, but I had an ice cream appointment with Holly, and Wendy's just doesn't rank enough to get in the way of plans that I have actually made.  (Don't tell Mom that, because that will kill my #1 excuse... shhh).  Although I didn't go in quite so early as Melissa wanted, I did get in at 1515, and left a little after 2000, when Eli showed up to take over Grill.    I regretted sleeping in this morning--I had actually gone to bed a bit earlier than usual the night before, especially considering the day off.  However, I had no motivation to get up really.  Nothing to do, nowhere to go until 1330.  I did wake up around 1000 though, so it wasn't too late.  I got caught up on the finances, synchronized everything, yadda yadda.  I've actually fallen behind on that in the past few days, believe it or not.    Catching up with Holly was fun.  We haven't really talked in a very long time.  She's definitely a funny gal.  That was $6 well spent on ice cream.  Of course, it was cut short because I had to be at work.  Luckily, I didnt' have to deal with any rush-hour traffic, which is utterly frustrating.  I'm going to start taking 275, I think--there's fewer cops if nothing else, and less congestion.  Anyhow... I got to work and had fun on sandwiches for an hour or so... screwed up nearly every one of them because I forgot the mustard... It's all a system... down the line, white, red, green, repeat... then you throw in this yellow bottle in the middle, not a part of anyone... never mind.  It was my first time, and I was never trained so I'm not too concerned.  I was on grill afterwards, until 8, which was also amusing, ironically.    I think that I get some satisfaction out of just having a full-time job.  I feel depended on... that missing essential cog from the museum that just made me say "Fuck it."  I was essentially an optional part there... but Wendy's?  it's a whole different ball game.  it's kinda nice, actually.  I hung around work until about 2100, then got home around 2140 (I took Blue Rock home...)  I talked on AIM until midnight, then went to White Castle.    That's when most of this dawned on me... is when I popped the lid on my large coffee...  That smell, that taste... the one so unique to a cup of white castle coffee, brings back many memories.  The first one to come to my head was of exactly a year ago... Getting in El Junko and John's Cutlass, heading over to IMAGO for a community service project with our "CMC CAT" that we attempted to start.  *chuckles*  It was Nick, Clare, John, Jonah, Collin, Holly (I think), and myself, and we went over to a little nature shrine in the midst of Price Hill and did yard work.  We were supposed to become regulars, but... well... never mind.  I remember speeding by John on Sixth St. Viaduct in El Junko... laying on the horn and leaving a cloud behind... That day started off at White Castle.    Another was walking through the halls of Walnut Hills on a Wednesday evening at 1930.  It was after a YAC meeting... I gave the grand tour of my "humoungous" high school, the good and the bad... That was fun.  It always helps when things like that go down with someone you really like... lol.  (Of course, that certain someone got their driving privleges revoked for lying about where she was...)  I walked down the halls... sipping my coffee... Good times.  There was another time, when I chewed out my Mom and got really angry... left the house on a Wednesday, and hopped in the car at 0130, and left.  I didnt' think I was going to come home that night, but, you know how that goes.  To cool down, I met John at the Chateau at the Ridge Road exit off 71...  Used a stimulant to calm me down, ironically... John was "fretting" about an overdue English paper, back when he was still in college.  ("fretting" defined as:  "It's two weeks late."  *shrugs*  "I'll just fail.")  There was another time when we went out to the one in Mason... ran into this guy on Front Reg... OMG... That was bad.  Then just recently we introduced Nick into our culture of the Castle... He seemed... scared.    It's rather odd... Last summer, I hung out with this bunch of people, then lost touch with all of them, so that I could pursue a prospect who was a member of an opposing clique...  or rather, didn't know anyone, but formerly dated a member of an opposing clique... well, not clique... they were just all against him.  Anyhow...  That was an interesting 6-7 months... but I still won, in a sense.  If nothing else, it ended in a draw--I know I didn't lose, that's a fact.  As Chris would say, "Meh."  "Your whole grill is chili meat."  "Meh."  "Steph's coming!"  "Oh yeah... Meh."  But yeah... so much is different--I'm applying to colleges, I'm going to be a SENIOR, I've got a real job, and real money to go with it... but so much is still the same--the core never transforms.  So yeah... Yearbook meeting tomorrow... I finally came up with a theme idea.  Woo hoo!  I'm much looking forward, both to it and to the trip to OU...   Life is looking up... and I'm damn happy about it.  All I can say is "It's about time."  Now, to conquer one more detail...   I can dim the lights and  Sing songs full of sad things We can do the tango just for two I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings Be your Valentino just for you! Ooo, love, ooo, lover boy Whatcha doing tonight, hey boy Set my alarm, turn on my charm That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy!  Oooo... let me feel your heart beat. Oooo... can you feel my love heat Come on and sit on my hot seat of love And tell me how you feel right after all I'd like for you and I to go romancing Say the word, your wish is my command!  Ooo, love, ooo, lover boy Whatcha doin' tonight, hey boy? Write my letter, fell much better And use my fancy patter on the telephone!  When I'm not with you, I think of you, I always miss you (Miss those hot summer nights) When I'm not with you Think of me always, I love you, love you Hey boy where did you get it from, Hey boy where did you go? I learned my passion  In the good old fashioned school of lover boys!  Dining at the Ritz, we'll meet at nine precisely (one two three four five six seven eight nine) I will pay the bill, you taste the wine Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely Just take me back to yours that will be fine (come on and get it)  Ooo... love, Ooo... Lover boy Whatcha doin tonight, hey boy? Everything's alright, just hold on tight That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy!

        SUBJECT LINE     Song in head:  I Don't Wanna Grow Up, I'm a Toys 'R' Us Kid...  Current Mood:  Unsure--Still Groggy  But yeah.  Yesterday was a pretty fun day.  I went to Kings Island with Brad and his family and his sister's friend.  I haven't been back to PKI in a long time so it was good to see the new stuff and revisit the old.  I put the fact that I was paying out of my ass for this in the back of my mind, and finally had a good time.  Plus, it was nice to catch up with Brad, and to chat with Amy and Jessie.  It was just a good day, and we stayed from 0945 to 2230... it was a long day, also.  There are a lot of stories and crap, about Kevin, and the scenery, and... other stuff, but they are best shared when I am fully awake.  So I'm sitting here at the computer, and I've got this 11-8 shift coming up.  It's a mixed blessing.  Firstly, I get to work during the day for once, which I am glad about.  Also, I'm going to rack up half of my weekly hours on my weekend days, which is another thing I'm glad about.  Also, if I wasn't going to work, I'd be stuck here with the family... which is worse than a visit to the dentist.  So, all in all, few negatives.  The only one that stands out in my mind is that I'm just sick of Tara's bullcrap.  I will have to deal with that from 4 or 5 on in, and through dinner, which is annoying.  *meh*  It's only for 3-4 hours out of nine... no biggie.  Anyhow... I must finish getting ready and such nonsense... later.

        Dick me Over?  I'll Get Your Ass Fired!     Song in head:  Throwing It All Away - Genesis  Current Mood:  Fuck!  It was a rather shitty day at the office... I'm in the dilemma again, I could spit out a shitload of numbers and other crap, but you won't get it unless you're John, who I've already complained to, so fuck it.  I got fucked on hours next week... why?  who knows.  It's up and down with p/t.  Going to PKI tomorrow.  Yay.  Big fun.    Found out that... I didn't bank anything, and 58% of this check went to two things... my muffler, and my mom.  another 10% to gasoline, of which I must buy more yet.  Also, that $28 to the photo chicks... Forgot about that.  In essence... this was the bill check... and I'm not pleased.  Grr.  On top of that... well, other issues that I shalln't go into right now.  Fuck.    You dont get angry a lot, but you build it up inside, you hide your feelings letting people walk all over you. This is not good, you are the worst type of anger, because when it comes out its like a volcano and I promise you will hurt someone you love, this is what I am.    urlLink   How Angry Are you?

        More Coffee, My Brother?     Song in head:  Saturday in the Park - Chicago  Current Mood:  Mucho Loco  Life, it has been said, is one big learning experience.  Here lies the content outline for the past five hours:  Lesson I: Regular Sleep Habits By getting sleep at regular intervals and on a consistent basis, the body performs and behaves much more normally.  In addition to sleeping times, comfortable quarters for sleep are also neccessary.  Failure to do so results in the body... well, going nuts.  For example, trying to go to sleep, but the body being so fucked up that it thinks you are only taking a nap, and, in turn will only allow you to sleep for 2.5 hours, from 10 until a bit past midnight.  While this internal clock may work for the body, sometimes it just doesn't jive with the rest of the world.  Lesson II:  Control Spontaneous Actions Sometimes, when insomnia cannot be cured, and it is 2AM, it may be in one's best interest to find sedentary activities to occupy free time.  Such activities do not include 100-mile drives into Southern states.  Lesson III:  Plan Before You Travel While refueling before departure on a trip is always good, more preparation is also required.  Maps are good to have, particularly when the area is new or foreign.  Furthermore, make sure that your vehicle is in proper working order before departure--assure that tires are inflated to the proper pressure, the radiator is in working order, fluids are topped off, and the exhaust system is securely fastened to the undercarriage of your vehicle.  Lesson IV:  Engine Exhaust is HOT This may seem like an easy one, but did you know that the heat escaping from an engine can heat up a tailpipe so much that it will not only  burn  a half-inch nylon rope, but will also  MELT  the tailpipe?  Lesson V:  Waffle Houses are Best Left Alone Until Inspected First --That's a whole slew of stories... from the pot to the roach to the eggshells... let's not go there--  Lesson VI:  Interstate 71 ends in Louisville, KY  Lesson VII:  Singing of 'Row, Row, Your Boat' can greatly calm and tune out bad situations.  Thirsty for more?  Oh, there's more...   The #1 Lesson:  Get some sleep, before you do something stupid.  ;kaDfnds;f kjd!!!  Chihuahua!

        Any Oranges for Your Kids Meal Today?     Song in head:  True - Spandau Ballet  Current Mood:  I think I'm tired... but... *shrugs*  After a long day at work, I came home and talked to mom for a while, but went to retire and get some extra sleep since I was feeling so dead... So I went to sleep at about 2225...  or at least tried to.  Somehow, this crazy mind of mine won't let me do that... All these dreams... of which one, wasn't even enjoyable... I was still at work... still taking orders... like... I wasn't even asleep.  *doh*  Even the good dreams, though... I couldn't nod off for the life of me.  I got up, and I feel even more like shit than when I laid down 3 hours ago, and I'll be lucky if I can sleep again at any other time besides noon tomorrow.  *waves fist*    So what do I do when tired and lonely?  That's right--waste money.  I called the AP Board and jumped the gun on my score report by 3 weeks... It was good news... 4 on US History and a 3 on Physics, but I feel so silly for paying $8 for an automated service just because I was so impatient.  *shrugs*  Maybe I would feel a little more excited if I wasn't so dead... and if I didn't get exactly what I thought I would.  I suppose it doesn't really matter.  Today is payday.  Yay.  So Dan Holthaus (REM EIC) called me today, told me about a meeting coming up for the REM... finalizing the details for the OU trip.  I'm very excited.  Unfortunately, I still have no ideas for the yearbook theme, which... *shrugs*  We're supposed to go over that at the meeting.    Mom:  So you got burnt out on bookstores? Joe:  Well, kinda.  I found coffee shops... one of which I'm pretty sure is within four blocks of this girl's house *points to Megan's picture in yearbook* Mom:  OOOOOO... she's pretty... *looks at name*  OH MY GOD!  That's Megan?!? Joe:  Uh, yes.  I told you she was gorgeous. Mom:  But she's even prettier than I imagined. Joe:  *nods, half approvingly; lets out sigh* I guess it's not my problem, she never returned any of my calls. Mom:  Oh.  *slap*  (insert comments here, dipshit!)  Where's the "Well, you should keep trying." or the "Maybe it's just not meant to be." or the further inquiry even?  Ay yi yi  Granted, I got what I wanted, I'm as far separated from my family as will humanly permit while still living in the same house.  They generally have more association with the people upstairs than me.  I suppose that I shouldn't complain... This is what I asked for.  *fucking kangaroos*  So a day off today (Saturday).  We'll see how that goes.  Then working July 4... another holiday on a Chris shift... see earlier comment regarding kangaroos.   MOre later... this is just absurd.

        Give It All to the Bob Jones University...     Song in head:  Don't Stop Me Now - Queen  Current Mood:  A Little Bit of Everything   Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a really good time--I feel alive!  And the world, we'll turn it inside out, I'm floating around in ecstasy, so don't stop me now, don't stop me 'cause I'm having a good time!   Okay, so it's another sleepless night, but not in Seattle.  I just don't know how I survive sometimes--not because of not being able to sleep, but somehow finding stupid ways to spend my time while I'm stuck awake... It's hard to do that, you know.   Eventually, you can only go to the same places so many times, and do the same stuff so many times, and drive the same routes so many times, and watch the same movies so many times... yadda yadda yadda.  However, tonight was entertaining.  I got the check deposited today (which was in excess of $520) *bows* and caught up on the finances.  Later, went out to dinner with John, where I bought for once (which somehow makes me happy) then followed up with coffee.  I think I got home around midnight, after having to stop and pick up milk from Kroger.  I got home, though, and...  It was a big dot-dot-dot.  So I changed my oil, where I got pissed off because some fucking asshole ganked my goddamn oil drainpan...........  I will kill, but not before lemon juice torture.  Anyhow, I used a regular bucket, nonetheless, so it got done, but was much more of a pain than it should have been.  I dont' understand what the mental block is with leaving my shit alone... no one touches anything except my auto-care stuff... my car wash sponge walked off the other day (and magically reappeared on my doorstep, no joke), my transmission funnel is still AWOL, now the oil pan... Rahhhh!!!    Anyhow, while I was changing my oil, I was downloading a computer bootleg copy of The Ladykillers, which John had reminded me today that I had never seen.  So, it was all done by the time I got back in.  I watched that, and was thoroughly entertained... now we're at about 230... What now?  I walked over to the bed, curled up in the pillow, and hid under the blanket.  245 now... sleep was no dice.  So... the room is too cold, so I go outside, which is too humid.  Solution:  Drive.  I was smart enough to venture not on a long-distance journey, but I drove for about an hour around town, hitting both west and east.  This took up some time, but, as I knew, it would not last forever.  So, I arrived at the Dent Steak 'N' Shake at 415 to buy a milk shake... and didn't leave until 430... waht great service, lemme tell ya.  Alas, it was when I found myself following the Sygma truck to its glenway store delivery that I decided to call it quits.    So now I'm at home, still awake, with no sleep possibility in sight... and I'm rounding 5AM.  Ahh, waht joy, to go to bed when the sun comes up.  I'm not due ionto work til 11, so I do have some time to catch a wuick nap if I so desire, and if I get tired enough.  I'm starting to get there now, I think.   But... yeah.  That's the skinny for now, I reckon.  I'm sure that more will come soon, for there is a nice, wonderful shift with Nick tomorrow.  Oh yay.   I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky, like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity; Like a racing car passing by, like Lady Godiva, I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me!!  Burning through the sky, 200 degrees, that's why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit, I'm traveling at the speed of light, I'm gonna make a supersonic man out of you!
