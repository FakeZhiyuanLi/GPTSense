      So it's my very first Halloween in the US (which is the only place that it is  really  celebrated) and I am unsure as to what I should be. So comment and let me know! I have a shortlist but feel free to make new suggestions.  ~ Snow angel ~ Princess Fiona from  Shrek  ~ Lady Liberty ~ An M&M  So far I'm leaning towards Lady Liberty but then I wonder if I shouldn't be something more... Australian. But then, what? Heylp meh!

      I know wristy isn't a word.. but I believe titles are everything and if nothing else, it's interesting :P  My wrist is killing me from sitting on a chair that's too high and having my wrist rest against the desk on an awkward angle. I'm having premonitions about me having arthritis in there 30 years from now. ;)  I'm browsing sooo many personal sites to get ideas for my own.. among them, I found a review site, whose sole purpose is to review other personal sites and give them ratings out of 100. Am I the only one that finds this idea completely arrogant and condescending? I mean, if you need some stranger's approval of your site, maybe you need a different hobby. My site's for me and I personally couldn't give a shit what a bunch of elitist snobs think as long as I'm happy with it.

          98% of teenagers have used pot, either experimentally or on a regular basis. If you're one of the 2% who hasn't, copy and paste this into your journal.       Before you ask, YES it makes me better than you! :P  I was feeling so bored and indifferent after Port got thrashed by Essendon that I called up 5AA and they bumped me to the front of the line because it was an international call! Mahaaa. I didn't talk about anything worth repeating but it was kinda cool to be connected to home, to something familiar, in that small way for a few minutes. What's even weirder is that about 5 calls later,  Alex Perilli  was on the line. I recognised his voice. I wondered if he had heard my call, if he'd recognised that there can't be that many 'Stefanie's from Adelaide living in Seattle that listen to the Port games on 5AA. In fact, I'd bet I'm the one and only. ;) So given that the odds are he did hear me and that the average idiot would have realised it was me, I wonder what went through his mind? When I heard him, I instinctively wanted to contact him somehow and laugh and let him know I heard him. His call was so passionate it made me laugh because he didn't give a shit about Port before he met my Dad and our family; I'm not the only one still affected by the saga that was those relationships. But you can't blame me for being bitter in the knowledge that I am affected in darker ways. Alex P is  Mary's  son. For those of you who still don't know who I'm talking about, don't ask. Just bask in my confused + cryptic comments.  At the moment Mum and I are launching out 3rd round of eBay sales and it's a huge one. We have a record 32 auctions up this week and at the moment we have 22 bids and 10 items that will sell. The most interesting sale? A pair of my brother's old Billabong jeans from Australia! The current high bidder is bidding $16.99 incl shipping all the way to Italy. :)

       Am currently in a shockingly bad mood;  urlLink my football team , usually quite competent, had a bad loss tonight in a perfectly winnable game. Grrrr. I am not. happy. Jan. I stayed up til 5.00am to listen to sub-standard audio and sit helplessly as my team forfeits the opportunity to steal top spot on the ladder and instead slip to 4th. Fuckity fuck fuck.  I'm trying to figure out what to do with this new blog *pats* I'm unsure how different it will be from my melo and all the rest of it. I'm thinking the melo might be for sculpted entries ilke those from the good ol' days whereas this blog will be an effective dumping ground for my useless ramblings.  I'm done now. You can go play some  urlLink games .

      I haven't been watching much Olympics over the last 2 days; the main swimming events are mostly been and gone and I have no real interest in track & field other than running. But, here's what has caught my attention.   I'm following the Iraq soccer team with interest and they're due to meet Australia tomorrow. I think their story is a great one, considering all that is going on with their country; they would have had an interuppted preparation, to say the very least and they were only able to make it to the Games thanks to a ride from the Australian Defence Force. *salutes* This week it seems Bush and/or some sneaky journalists have managed to  urlLink piss off  the team.  I think  urlLink this brief article  somes up why the Iraqis would be pissed and I would have to agree. I'm outraged that Bush could produce something so smarmy after murdering thousands of Iraqi civilians; where exactly does he get off!? This seems an appropriate time to slip in another urge for ALL young Americans to  urlLink VOTE !   French tennis player Amelie Mauresmo  urlLink ruined  young Aussie Alicia Molik's dreams of gold tonight, though the spirited youngster is still in the hunt for bronze.  I had no hope of seeing it on TV, but the Aussie women were part of a  urlLink thrilling waterpolo match  that I wish I'd witnessed and Anna Meares won Australia's second  urlLink cycling gold  in the 500m time trial.  Aussie flag tattoos are common (especially for swimmers) but I just loved Olympic gold medallist Anna Meares'  urlLink fingernails !

      Thursday night Mum guided me through making my very first  urlLink pavlova  (see below for a pic of mine!); a classic Australian dessert that whilst surprisingly easy to make, never ceases to impress. It's basically meringue, whipped cream and fruit and is SO very delicious! :D        I took it along for the dessert bake-off at the  urlLink Food Lifeline  Staff Picnic at  urlLink Carkeek Park  in north Seattle. I'd never heard of the park before but it's a huge park complete with beach, a hgue grass area and play equipment for the kids. We rented out picnic tables, a shelter and a BBQ and had a great lunch. I actually had a really fun day - we had a water balloon fight, played some volleyball, a 3-legged race and all in all, I had great fun, especially with Denise and Nikki. OH and my pav won 1st place in the bake-off! LOL! Remember how I said it neevr ceases to impress? :P The Americans had never heard of it before let alone tasted it so they all loved it and I wound up with a $20 gift certificate for  urlLink Albertson's .  My 2003  urlLink school  yearbook arrived by international courier today (thanks Dad!). I was disappointed with the boring cover and the fact that most of the pages were black & white (stingy!) but the  urlLink Year 12 Formal  page looked awesome! It was kinda bizarre to see my valete in the back there and I quickly grew tired of seeing Skye's face on every second page but overall, it was good :)

      And I thought it was just me letting personal feelings get in the way regarding the judging that saw Paul Hamm make an unprecedented comeback from 12th to 1st with just 2 apparatus to go.   Looks like the majority of gymnasts  urlLink agree  with me, even those out of contention for the medals and hence without a stake in the judging of the final round.  Of course, there's no mention of any of this on US TV that I've seen, which isn't wholly suprising. It's just like we've heard little about Gary Hall Jr's resentment towards Phelps and his spot in the relay team that finished third that is apparently all over the Australian media. Even the Aussie athletes are talking about it in post-race interviews; how there's talk that Hall has lost all faith in his country and his Olympic team because they made a decision to put a player in the relay that didn't deserve to be there - purely so he might achieve an out-of-reach record by winning a certain amount of gold.  But, regardless, I have to agree with one of the last sentences in the linked article above that went something like this:   Did Paul Hamm do enough to make a successful comeback for gold? The only answer that matters now, is: yes.

      Most I've talked to hate the new search bar on the top of Blogger (look up; mine's tan!) and I'm undecided. On the one hand, the "Next Blog" feature brings more traffic to your site but I've found that most of these people only stay a few seconds, if that.   But what IS cool is that my blog is popping up in searches on Yahoo! and MSN!  urlLink Someone searched  on MSN.com using the keywords "Olympic games 2004" and my blog came up! I think the search results change frequently so it might not happen everytime, but still cool nonetheless!        Same with Yahoo! - someone was searching for photos of Aus diver Robert Newbery and my site was returned! Wheee..

      I've long been in agreeance with the stereotype that America is in arrogant country and here's the latest proof.  Think about the last time you saw a medal tally table. How do they order the countries? 9 out of 10 tables will order countries in the number of medals won, starting with gold; if tied on gold they'll go by silver and if tied on silver, they'll go by bronze. Not so in the USA:       Look for an example of how it should be done in my sidebar!  On a brighter note, I have to say I'm impressed with  urlLink Paul Hamm's  efforts to come back from a horrible fall on vault that pushed him down from 1st to 12th to win the  urlLink All Around gymnastics gold  for the first time ever by an American man. It was nice to see even his Romanian competitor slap him on the back after nailing his parallel bars in spite of his disastrous performance on the previous apparatus.  Commentators called it the greatest sporting moment they've ever witnessed and I have to admit it was simply amazing - his high bar routine was the best I've ever seen in my admittedly limited gymnastics viewing!   I won't turn this post into a rant about the merits of judging sports like gymnastics and ice skating but when something like this happens, and the result is decided by 12 1000s (thousandths) of a point, a little warning bell should be ringing somewhere in the back of minds everywhere.

      Where to start... I missed a whole day of Olympics thanks to my stupid decision to stay up all night the night before and having fallen asleep early on Tuesday. Hence, this post combines the last two days and doesn't distinguish between the two.  The big shock is obviously the defeat of the Aussies in the 4 x 200m freestyle relay to the Americans. Needless to say, most Australians were devastated; we've owned the event since 1988. I missed the match and still haven't seen it (if anyone knows of existing video, please let me know) but I've heard it was VERY close. I've also heard that one Australian didn't really do his part. I can only assume it was the relative unknown  urlLink Nicholas Sprenger  but I jsut found out he swam his personal best in the race. If not him, I would assume it's Michael Klim but without having seen it, I can't be sure.  Continuing the agony are the Aussie women in the 4 x 200 freestyle relay who could only finish fourth (despite a brilliant effort from anchor Petria Thomas) whilst the Americans grabbed gold. It really wasn't a great night in the pool for Australia; though the silver lining (ha ha) was  urlLink Petria Thomas' medal  in the 200m butterfly. Also of note was Jodie Henry's  urlLink breaking  of the world record in the 100m freestyle final; she seemed genuinely delighted & surprised to beat the WR of fellow Aussie  urlLink Libby Lenton , who shocked by failing to make the final.  Still in swimming,  urlLink Leisel Jones  continues along the journey to shake the  urlLink choker tag  by qualifying for the 200m breaststroke and champion swimmer  urlLink Grant Hackett calls  for the 800m frestyle event to be included in the Olympic Games, which I would completely agree with. There's no reason to cut off endurance swimmers like that. Boo, hiss.  Continuing the updates on our  urlLink tutu   urlLink security breach , he's been given a whopping  urlLink 5 months in jail ! Is this not the perfect example of an excessive sentence in the name of giving a warning to others?!  As for the upcoming, Australian basketballers have the  urlLink perfect chance  to beat the "Dream Team" from the USA on Thursday - if not now, it'll probably be never.  My beach volleyball girls Pottharst and Lochowicz are well placed to challenge the  urlLink favoured American girls  after  urlLink finishing top of their pool  by beating Mexico in three sets. Likewise, the Aussie men Prosser & Williams also went through to the elimination round after beating Canada. I for one was surprised to see the popularity of beach volleyball in Greece, when the tradtionally popular gymnastics stands appear extremely close to empty on TV. It seems I've found  urlLink the reason .  p.s. In all the disappointment, I forgot to mention Thorpe's awesome performance to  urlLink win bronze  in the 100m freestyle. He only just scraped into the final with the 8th fastest time and stormed home to finish 3rd. Congrats Thorpey - his first bronze completes a heavy set of Olympic medals :)

       I think  urlLink this dentist  reaches a whole new level of WRONG.  The funniest part is how he tries to deny it even after the police find the syringes! At that point, I think you have to throw your hands in the air and say "okay, you got me, I'm one sick f---!"

      I just know you want more of my inane Olympics commentary - well, be careful what you wish for because here it is. ;)  First off, here's a picture (click for article) of that crazy  streaker  I was  urlLink telling  you about:   urlLink    For the record, his blurry chest sported a website address that I can't remember the name of. It was goldenSOMETHING.com ;) My preliminary searches turned up nothing but milk & cookies to the person that can hunt it down.  I don't claim to know much about competing in an Olympics or any sort of national/international events (shock horror!), but I was slightly disturbed by Leisel Jones'  urlLink comments  after her  urlLink shock finish  in 3rd in her pet event the 100m breaststroke:    "I guess I'm just not meant to win," a deflated Jones said, no doubt remembering winning silver at the Sydney 2000 Games as a 15-year-old.... "I believe thoroughly that things happen for a reason so this obviously means something."    Yes, it means that you're unable to perform when the pressure's on; when it really matters. Some would even call you a choker:   choker  noun 2: an unfortunate person who is unable to perform effectively because of nervous tension or agitation; "she could win if she wasn't a choker"  from Dictionary.com   But nonetheless, she'll be back for Beijing and maybe then, she can shake the tags off.  The mens gymnastics team final last night saw the USA winning their first mens team medal in gymnastics from a non-boycotted Games (should 1984 medals really count at all? :P) and it also saw a little success for the Romanian men in the form of a bronze medal. I guess it must be nice after sitting back and watching the women dominate and wni the medals. I've decided I prefer the womens gymnastics to the mens because I like the events more; I'd rather watch the uneven bars and the beam than the rings and the high bar.   Coming up next post : Canadian swimming (disaster), Aussie women in beach volleyball, feel-good story of the day & white water kayaking.   p.s.  Hugs to  urlLink Barista  for linking my blog in a 8/17 post - isn't it just the little things that make your day that much better?

      I'm so sick and tired of being fat. Usually I would post the most unflattering picture of myself but I just don't hate myself that much :P But, I have had it up to here. This year I've kinda been obsessed with my body and my image, which I can't say is a healthy thing.  But I know I'm going to be bitterly disappointed if I go home in the same bad shape, in the "overweight" BMI category. To give you an idea of how bad it is, I've lost 20 pounds (that's roughly 9 kilograms) since the start of the year and I'm STILL overweight.   Readers that know me, will remember back to year 12 (it was only 2003 - surely your memory isn't that bad :P) and know that I'm a completely lazy procrastinator; I put everything off until the very last minute.   Apologies to Alex, who has just read some of this rambling self-analysis in an email, but here goes... it seems that I would unconsciously prefer to work twice as hard say, overnight, than I would to work at normal pace over a week. I did it all through year 12 and actually, that worked out bloody well for me, so you never know :P   So, I have roughly 36 days until Fiji. 36 days = 7 weeks, 1 day. This gives me more than enough time to complete the  urlLink Slim in 6  program, which I KNOW gives me results, because the first 3 weeks I did it back in February, I lost 15 pounds (approx. 3 kg) and I've more than kept it off since.  The official goal is to lose 2 pounds a week, which means I'll be 14 pounds lighter by Fiji. But the unofficial goal is to lose twice that: 28 pounds over 7 weeks. To aid my plan, I'll be keeping an online weight loss blog - the link to follow.   Wish me luck.

      I've just finished watching two Greek divers  urlLink do a Bradbury !  Nikolaos Siranidis and Thomas Bimis won the mens synchro 3m springboard after both the Chinese and Russian teams suffered from freak mistakes. The Chinese, heavy favourites and cemented in 1st place after 4 out of 5 rounds, missed their last dive and failed to score a single point after one of its members lost control and smacked into the water neck first. The Russians almost missed their last dive when one of their divers' legs hit the springboard on the way down, putting a huge dent in the score for their final dive.   The manner in which the Greeks snuck in to 1st place after more talented teams fell down (metaphorically speaking) is reminiscent of  urlLink Steven Bradbury's victory  in Salt Lake City 2 years ago. It is Greece's first ever diving gold medal and their first gold medal of the 2004 Games.  Also of interest is that the Greek pair qualified for the event solely on merit, instead of by the automatic host nation qualification.  In an enthralling hour of TV, the diving event also saw the security measures made into a mockery after a streaker/intruder wearing some sort of tutu stormed the area and jumped into the pool as a team was getting ready to dive. Yup, 10 points to those security guys - top job, blokes.

      Thorpe's  urlLink victory  in the 200m freestyle overnight made a mockery of claims by some that Phelps is the new king of swimming. Phelps finished with a bronze behind Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband (sp). Phelps had hinted all week that he can't wait to swim in the same race as Thorpe (presumably to beat him or show him how good he is) and all week I've had to listen to American commentators boast that Phelps is now the best all-round swimmer in the world and that there has never been anyone like him (a young 19 year old).  LOL! What a joke. Thorpe was just 17 in 2000 when he smashed world records and walked away with 3 gold medals and a bag of silver and bronze.  CONGRATULATIONS Ian Thorpe, we're all so so proud of you!  Other great Aussie medal wins overnight include the first woman shooting gold medal, won by Suzanne Balogh. Also a surprise was Brooke Hanson's silver in the 100m breaststroke.  Among the disappointments are "Lethal" Leisel Jones' bronze in the 100m breaststroke after she beat the Olympic Record in the semi-finals; she was expected to finish gold and her 3rd placing does nothing to quell claims that she's a "choker". Missing out on medals are Aussie diving pair Loudy Tourky and Lynda Folauhola that finished 4th behind the Chinese, Russians & Canadians in the synchro 10m diving platform.  Once again, I was up late soaking in the Games goodness. I saw a FANTASTIC game of mens' waterpolo between the USA & Croatia that the US won after being 1 goal down with 26 seconds left in the game. They scored a goal on the siren and that was it.. only the prelims, but it was awesome to watch. the lead changed about 4 times in the last quarter.  I also saw the  urlLink aforementioned  Aussie men lose their second beach volleyball match to a Swiss pair, Norweigan women beat the Swiss in the same sport and the Australian womens' softball team get thrashed 10-0. Also of interest that I saw was the US basketball match that they lost to Puerto Rico. It brings the US Olympic win-loss record to 109-3. LOL! Unbelievable. It's just the 3rd game they've lost EVER and you should hear the doomsday predictions from the US commentators. And they wonder why I prefer to tune in to the Canadian CBC - well, that's mainly because the maple leaves seem to enjoy seeing Aust beat the USA as much as I do :P   Athens 2004 Olympic Games  GOLD: 6 Ian Thorpe - Mens 400m Freestyle, Mens 200m Freestyle Thomas/Henry/Mills/Lenton - Womens 4x100 Freestyle Relay Sara Carrigan - Womens Road Cycling Suzanne Balogh - Womens Trap Shooting Petria Thomas - Womens 100m Butterfly  SILVER: 2 Grant Hackett - Mens 400m Freestyle Brooke Hanson - Womens 100m Breaststroke  BRONZE: 4 Chantelle Newberry & Irina Lashko - Womens Synchro 3m Sp-board Diving Robert Newberry & Mathew Helm - Mens Synchro 10m Platform Diving Leisel Jones - Womens 100m Butterfly Adam Vella - Mens Trap Shooting  SWIMMING: 7 SHOOTING: 2 DIVING: 2 CYCLING: 1   Sydney 2000  GOLD: 16 SILVER: 25 BRONZE: 17  My blog will be largely Olympic Games until the closing ceremony.. it just means that there is nothing else going on here to report and I'd rather spend time finding out Olympic results than finding other articles to blog.

      I'm so enjoying the beach volleyball right now. I'm parrticularly following the plight of  urlLink Prosser & Williams , the Aussie men. They upset the Americans last night and now they're playing a great match into the third game against the Swiss. They don't look good for this one unfortunately. But they're seeded 17th so they're doing better than most people expected.  Another surprise was the Australian women all-around gymnastics team making the final for the first time  ever .  The highlight of the day though, has to be the gold medal win of veteran Petria Thomas. She's played bridesmaid to Madame Butterfly Susie O'Neill and then Dutchwoman Inge de Brujin for years - she won her first individual gold in the 100m butterfly.  Blogger has been acting up all day so these entries had to wait til my eyes were tired and bleary; apologise. But it's given me time to work on my  urlLink website ; I got a brand new layout up this weekend and it's really starting to take shape.

      I bet a lot of you have guesses as to what a "girly tube" is.. but unless you've ever seen one in a store, I bet your guesses are wrong.  Let me give you a bit of background.. I'm Stef. I'm a 17 year old girl volunteering in a hospital gift shop. We do about $1800 sales in a day = a lot of customers. About 3-4 times a day, someone will be paying for their purchase, spot the  girly tubes  and say one of the following things:  "Oooh, these are pretty. What are they?" "Oh my, these are bright but whatever are they for?" "Dude, what the hell is this?" "Oooh look mommy, I want one of these. What's it for?" "*picks up tube* Is this... no. It can't be.. tell me this isn't for _____!"  Now let me tell you what they're all looking at. It's a bunch of long, thin pink tubes (looks like test tubes) with "tres femme" (or 'very woman') scrawled on the side. Fake crystals, pearls, gems and various other bright, sparkly things adorn the tube, with the icing on the cake an eye-catching pearl or sparkly crown sitting on the top. In other words, they're both ritzy and gaudy enough to catch  everyone's  attention.       Still can't figure out what it's for? It's to  carry your tampon around in .   Yes, I'm serious. Yes, I wish I was kidding. Don't you feel sorry for me, having to answer the "what" question to all of those customers, including men & young kids? Well, I feel sorrier for John, the 14 year-old male volunteer having to answer the same questions! Oh and before you Australians say that it's "too long", know that Americans use applicator tampons. Maybe that's an overshare, but it's also a frustrating fact of life for us anti-applicator girls who struggle to find a normal tampon.   urlLink Want one?

        "Ladies and gentlemen, uh, we've just lost the picture, but what we've seen speaks for itself. The Corvair spacecraft has apparently been taken over- 'conquered' if you will- by a master race of giant space ants. It's difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive Earthman or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords. I'd like to remind them as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves."  -- Kent Brockman,  The Simpsons        For those of you that don't know, I worship The Simpsons.  urlLink Homer  mainly, but also the writing :P One of the funniest shows of all time.  But back to the  urlLink giant ant invasion ; it's nice to know my new city (as of March 2005) is so stable :P

       What if Australia was  urlLink no longer down under ?  I caught a little swimming, diving and beach volleyball this morning on NBC. I think the only live one was the womens' 4x100m relay, which was also undoubtedly the highlight :D The USA has had a stranglehold on the event for years and the last time Australia won gold in a womens' relay was in Melbourne in 1956 when the likes of Dawn Fraser ruled the pool. Veteran Petria Thomas & Olympic debutantes Jodie Henry, Alice Mills and Lisbeth Lenton swam a new world record of 3:35:94 to hold off the Americans. I was especially proud of Jodie Henry, who swam an awesome final leg to hold off the American Jenny Thompson :D  I plan on listing all of Australia's medal wins, mostly so I can keep track myself without all of the TV coverage I'm used to. I'm also interested to see if the  urlLink predicted letdown  after hosting an Olympics will come into play.   Athens 2004 Olympic Games  GOLD: 2 Ian Thorpe - Mens 400m Freestyle Thomas/Henry/Mills/Lenton - Womens 4x100 Freestyle Relay  SILVER: 1 Grant Hackett - Mens 400m Freestyle  BRONZE: 2 Chantelle Newberry & Irina Lashko - Womens Synchro 3m Sp-board Diving Robert Newberry & Mathew Helm - Mens Synchro 10m Platform Diving   Sydney 2000  GOLD: 16 SILVER: 25 BRONZE: 17

      THE OLYMPICS ARE HERE! :D  Picture me jumping up and down inside! I just love the Olympics. The earliest I remember are Barcelona in 1992. The thrill of an Olmypic event is one you can't find anywhere else. You can win all the gold in the world but none of it is worth as much as the Olympic gold medal. In 2000, Australia won the most medals  proportionate to its size and population . We rock the cazbar :D   My wish for this Olympics is for Australia to win more swimming gold than the USA. Either way, I'll be tuning in to each and every event broadcast here with an Australian in it - how I will track them all down, I'm not sure :P   Bring on the opening ceremony (but let it be not as spectacular as Sydney! ;))

       ... for to dwell upon them is to add to the offense. -- Henry David Thoreau  I don't see the point in  urlLink branding  sex offenders.   If anything, I just feel disturbed by the knowledge that there are 2 Level III and 4 Level II  urlLink sex offenders  in my area. What am I supposed to do with this information? Does anyone think that by knowing what street these people live on and perusing personal details and a photo, that I am supposed to save myself from the unimaginable?   The assumption is that these people have served their time for the crime (what does "indecent liberties" mean anyway?); they're either fit to be in the community or they're not. Is feeding fear really the way to go about reintegrating them into society? Or, is it the American way to punish without opportunity for rehabilitation?   In one known case, the assertion that the sex offender is a danger to society is certainly questionable. The  urlLink story  of Mary Letourneau is a bizarre one - she started a relationship with a then-12-year-old boy when she was a 34 yo school teacher and they had 2 children together (!) before she was tried for statutory rape and given a suspended sentence. Unable to resist seeing him again, they were caught in a car together and she served 7 1/2 years in prison. Now, I would argue that someone like Mary doesn't deserve to be branded for life on a website accessible to anyone and everyone in the entire world. The relationship was entirely consensual but she broke the law and she did her time in prison for it. Does she not deserve a second chance at a normal life?  In other news, I've found yet another  urlLink strike  against Seattle beaches; one I  urlLink visited  not a few weeks ago.

      I am SO pissed. I just wrote the entire  urlLink links  page only to have Aloof crash on me and me lose it all. It's 3am. I have neither the time nor the patience to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it! I would rather you just said "thank you" and went on your way!!  ... oops. Wrong speech.  p.s. doesn't the word  vindicated  sound like it should mean 'pissed off'?

      I used to be good at finding relevant post titles... I suck.  Thanks to  urlLink Aussie Expats , I found out that the Aussie flag is on its way home:    FOUND beneath tens of thousands of tonnes of rubble and twisted steel, a soiled and crumpled Australian flag is a solemn reminder that September 11, 2001, was more than an American tragedy. Now, almost three years after 2749 people perished in New York, the Australian standard is heading home where the Federal Government will have it preserved and mounted. The Government intends to consult the relatives of the 11 Australians killed by terrorists on September 11 on how best to display the flag. Ten Australians died in New York and one in Washington.   :)  I've also found what I think will be my  urlLink Olympic news source . Woot woot!

      Dear sleaze-in-the-bus-tunnel,  Quit staring at me. I don't understand your strange and disturbing comments but I know I don't like them. I don't know why you would suggest that I "drink a lot of milk" and I definitely don't know how milk "does wonders for the body". Maybe you should bring a book next time, so you have something to occupy yourself. I would suggest  urlLink this  one.  Cheers, Jane*   *name changed for protection (not really.. :P)

      I saw this book in the Harborview gift shop about  urlLink signing  to your baby before he/she can talk.   The skeptic in me says "what a load of crap/waste of time" but the mother in me (waaaaaaaaay deep down in there) says it would be kinda cool to have a secret (for all intent and purpose) language with my baby. I guess if I had time and/or energy I would give it a go.  There was a 24-page Olympic liftout that I snagged from the  Seattle Times  today. I searched frantically for any news on the Australians but all I could find was a couple of references to and photos of  urlLink Lauren Jackson  (Australian women's basketball team) and an article about the rivalry between Ian Thorpe and  urlLink some American  in the mens swimming.   It does seem like I picked a bad year to spend the year away from home, what with my 18th birthday and the Athens Olympics. I'm going to have to stay glued to  urlLink The Australian  website to get regular medal tallies and news on the plight of the Australians. I can't wait to go to some events at the  urlLink 2006 Commonwealth Games , even though everyone knows it's not the same.  xo

      It's one of those nights where I don't want to go to bed but I have no real reason not to. I think it's because in my mind, the sooner I go to sleep, the sooner I wake up and catch the same bus to the same volunteer organisation to answer the same phone.   Sometimes I feel like my blog should be the well-written, entertaining type like  urlLink Stupid Evil Bastard  but then I think it's just too much work. I'd rather have a blog for me, that makes me feel better or gives me something to do, than have a blog that's just another part of my list of chores. I think that's why I got sick of  urlLink melo  - I felt like I should be writing long, entertaining posts when all I really wanted to do was ramble.  I feel sorry for  urlLink these people ... for a split second before I crack up laughing!!! Funny shit. ( urlLink want   urlLink more ?)  And now, for a little taste of classic Dubya:    "I know what I believe. I will continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe - I believe what I believe is right."  -- Rome, July 22, 2001   Is  urlLink this  who you want running your country for another 4 years?    urlLink Choose  or Lose; VOTE !  xo

      We went all domesticated today and spend the day in the kitchen baking. Our apple tree in the backyard grew a whole bunch of huge, red apples so we used them to make a good ol' homemade apple pie! Mum made the crust pastry and then we peeled like 50 apples, cut out the bad bits and mixed them with cinnamon, nutmeg, flour and sugar to make the perfect apple pie! We actually made TWO today and also another two tomorrow because there are so many damn apples. ;) Anyway, we had some for dessert with vanilla bean ice-cream (OMG! new obsession! you can't get it at home and it's like vanilla in a brand new tasty way for me) and it was fantastic.   We also made some biscotti & stewed some apples (well, attempted... they burned..) We also ate the carrots & beans fresh from the market - tastiest veggies ever.   I slept in way too long today but then that's not so unusual. I'm off to  urlLink Food Lifeline  tomorrow.. I'm growing a little tired of volunteering, I have to admit. I won't miss it when I get to actually be paid for my work again.  xo

      We spent the day today at Waverly Beach Park in Kirkland, a second attempt in the continuing effort to find the best beach in the Seattle area. Or rather, the beach most like what we grew accustomed to back home.  Today reinforced two conclusions I have come to:  1. We take beaches in Australia for granted in a way I never even knew about.  2. The first thing I'm doing when I get home is hitting Somerton Beach and I'm staying there everyday til I can't get no more!  Honestly, I can't remember the last time I swam at a beach back home. It was probably in Year 10? But after my experience here, I'll be going every weekend that I can! There's really no way you can fully understand the frustration of not being able to access a real beach when you most want it, but I'm going to draw you up a couple of lists to help:      Beaches in Australia    Beaches in Seattle (and probably the US bar California & Florida)        White sand   Clear water   Mostly seaweed-free   Can swim anywhere you like at 99% of beaches     Rocks/pebbles and grey sand (if lucky)   Green or dark blue water   Slimy seaweed   Can swim at 2% of beaches in blocked off, designated areas      In spite of the obvious drawbacks, we had a great day.. we hit the  urlLink Juanita Sunday Market  beforehand and bought some fresh, organic apricots, peacharines (they call them nectarines here), carrots &amp; beans; yummmm.  There was a playground at the park for India and unlike  urlLink Alki Beach  in West Seattle, the water was warm enough for us to swim in comfortably! Whee. If it weren't for the choppy waves, water murkiness and stringy seaweed, it would have been a perfect 10! ;)  Photos over  urlLink here .  xo

      I just had to post and show you this gorgeous poncho we're bidding on on eBay:       We've been looking everywhere and haven't seen anything that even comes close to this one... tis beautiful! :) Fingers crossed we win it!  Time seems to be running away from me; now more than ever I don't seem to have enough. I'm currently  urlLink reading  up on  urlLink blogging  to get some ideas for this thing and of course I'm still working on my site - click the pink fountain to see it so far.  xo

      I feel anxious. Maybe because I'm turning 18 in 17 days. Or maybe because I'm unsure as to where I'll be after October 5th; my location depends on some asshole US immigration officer. NOT the kind of person you want to hang these sorts of things on.  If I get turned away at LAX, I'll head up to Vancouver in Canada, collect my bags and continue on my itinerary to Toronto and London. I think then I'll do one of 2 things: 1. Get a job and work for a couple of months in London or 2. Spend a couple of weeks with Steph B and then head home through Singapore. Each has problems.. #1 is a problem because I have nowhere to live and there'll be a gap between when I get to London and when I start earning. In other words, I'll have to borrow some cash from my parents and stay in a London hostel (which isn't an issue in itself.. apparently there's some area where all of the Australians live in share houses or something). #2 is a problem because I don't think I'm quite ready to go home and even if I was, what would I do between now and February when I move to Melbourne? I suppose I would work. But then, I could do that in London and continue my world travel thing I got going on. Maahaa.  I have to volunteer tomorrow. And if the novelty was wearing off a month ago, it's well and truly gone now. I don't know why organisations go and recruit volunteers only to have them spend 2 hours on a bus and arrive with  nothing to do .  What  is the point? Why not tell me I'm not needed so I can give my services to someone who does? ... HAHA okay, okay so I can stay home and build my site.  I'm going to bed now that I'm all overwhelmed. I WILL reply to emails tomorrow. Dooooo it.

      I WON! I WON! I WON THE LOTTERY!!  ... okay, not really. But I do seem to win a lot of (albeit useless) stuff. Today in the mail I received this letter:   Dear Stefanie,  CONGRATULATIONS! You have been selected in the Arboretum Foundation's July drawing to receive a complementary Individual level Foundation Membership (valid for one year), four issues of the  Bulletin  horticulture magazine and one copy of  Cuttings Through the Year  - a $50.00 value.   I actually volunteer at the Arboretum so I already get the gift shop discount but I also scored 2 tickets to the Japanese Garden and a free plant from the greenhouse. I'll always take something for nothing :D Well, if you count my 50 hours of volunteering as "nothing".   Anyway, winning stuff makes my day. I slept in longer than I wanted to so I didn't get as much of my site done as I wanted. But I spent literally hours on the  urlLink charm bracelet page  (under Half Crazy).   Season finale of  Ashlee  tonight :D I've given up on most reality shows, but I'm hooked on this one. Tis my guilty pleasure of the summer!

      I feel  exhausted . I'm not sure why - I probably haven't been getting enough sleep but then I never do, never have. Tomorrow's my only day off volunteering and I want to spend the day getting a few more of my site pages up. It feels like a load on my shoulders - I know it should be fun, and it is, but I just want it to be DONE already!! I want it to be all finished because I have this picture in my head and I know exactly how it's going to be and I want it in front of me. On top of that, I need to write at least 3 or 4 emails and do some research for upcoming trips to Seaside and Fiji. I know, I should stop babbling here and do it but this stuff is mindless.. it's about all my brain will produce right now.  If I was in better mental shape, I'd be launching in to some of my obsessions I am indulging right now but you'll have to make do with a list:  Ashlee Simpson, Nip/Tuck, North Shore & eBay.  Oh, and visit this site:  urlLink NotBush.com   I know it's not my country but I just hate to see colossal morons in charge of world super powers. Either way though, get out and VOTE! It's such a privilege and I hate to see so many Americans throw it away;  urlLink Choose or Lose .

      I'd love to stay 4 years old forever :D The simplest things bring you joy. Today when I was downloading pics from the digital camera on to the computer, I discovered a little photo journey that my little sister had obviously gone on! I'll set up a way for you to view it later because it is SO funny :) She's taken photos of her dolls in all diff positions and she's rearranged things in my room etc.. she's such a mischievous lil monkey.  We got photos back today from way back in January when we were skiing in Idaho & Stevens Pass and there are some great ones - these 2 are among my faves! Just so you know, me and my brother were fighting (and giggling!) over the prime position on the couch so Mum decided to snap some shots when we were off guard (low blow!). They're scans so not the best quality but cute nonetheless! If you look closely, you'll see my hair all braided, fresh from the International Marketplace in Hawaii :D           Ok, off to sleep. Tomorrow's going to be a good day - half of our eBay auctions are ending so we get to live the excitement of snipers and last-second bids on our sales :D I'm also catching reruns of  One Tree Hill  on the WB; episodes I've never seen before! Wheeeeeeeee. Sundays rock. Oh, and HAPPY AUGUST ! The bestest month of the year. I'll leave you with a shot of India eating some snow.. teehee.
