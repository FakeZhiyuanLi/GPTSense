      After a viscous threat from Teh Dickyblog, I feel I must post on my blogspot. I am filled with wonderment to find out if Scott Parker received my note, but I guess I will never know, never that is, until I break into his house and ask him at gunpoint. Charlton lost yesterday, so my weekend was filled with unhappiness, but I will live through this week safely in the knowledge that next week the long awaited Easter break starts. Hoooray!

      Hi, just got back from the Stamford Bridge. Our tour guide was Tim from The Office. It was pretty decent, although I didn't bump in to Scott Parker. But, I did my best to annoy him. I left one of my wanted signs in the Dressing Room, hiding on one of the weight machines which he will hopefully see, and, in the superstore, I put different players' shirts in front of his so no one could find them. He is a bit of a bastard though. The stadium was nice though, saw the Dressing room, press room, shop, tunnel, dugouts, sheep farm, money vault (big, full of sheep) and the Shed End (full of sheep).

      OK, not much to say, so a funny joke for ya, courtousy of David Gilster, on the AOL Jokes board:    Two ramblers were out rambling, which is what ramblers are good at, when they came upon a farm with a sign advertising eggs for sale.  They made their way through the yard and asked Farmer Giles for two dozen eggs.  While he went off to get them, they had a look around.  They were amazed to find a pig sty fitted out with all the refinements of a five star hotel.  Patio with sun loungers, parasol, swimming pool and a whole range of fine food and drink.  The sole occupant being a very happy, three legged  porker laying back on the lounger and sipping on a tequila sunrise.  When Farmer Giles returned, they naturally asked why the pig was housed in such luxury.  "Well" said the farmer, "That's Perce the Superpig, nothing is too good for old Perce."  The ramblers asked why.  "Last year the farmhouse caught fire in the middle of the night.  Perce raced down the road to the 'phone box, called the fire brigade, then raced back to the house, burst through the flames and carried all six of us to safety.  Nothing is too good for old Perce."  "Wow"  agreed the ramblers.  "And that's not all, six months ago our youngest daughter aged four went missing.  We put old Perce onto it, and he found the trail and followed it to the river five miles away, just in time to see little Sally fall into the raging torrent.  Old Perce dived in, swam 200 yards to find Sally on the river bed, he grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to safety, where he applied AV, got her breathing and carried her back to the farm.  Nothing is too good for old Perce."  "That's the most fantastic story we've ever heard" said the ramblers, "But why has he only got three legs?"  "Well now"  mused the old farmer,  "When you've got a pig that good, you don't eat it all at once."

      Boooo ya! So, free Chessington World of Adventures trip today. And it wern't bad, mainly because the average queue time was 0 minutes. Vampire was very good, Rattlesnake was ok, Samuri had fallen down, and, shock horror, Beanoland was closed.  The longest queue was infact for Mcdonalds, the robbing bastards. They gave out free Happy Meals to the kiddies, so therefore we had to eat there aswell.  Overall, I would advise my many fans that Thorpe Park would be a better choice to go for if you wanna go to a Park.  mmmmmmm..cat

      Alright, post no. 3 or 4. Great day, Charlton beat Middlesborough 1-0 and Ant and Dec are back! And its the final of Stars in their Eyes. And Palace lost. And Scott Parker finally came out of the closet and admitted that he is gay. I saw Oliver Holden-Ray at the football, but was once again I was dissapointed not to see Matt there. He just blends in to well with Charlton fans, blatently a closet Charlton fan now!

      Ok, so its Friday evening! Not the most of exciting days, as you will find out is what happens most days. In fact, the most exciting thing I did today was watching fat kids doing PE in 5th period. The thing which really made me happy was the fact I saw 2 of them stack! I handed in my money for the Stamford Brigde trip, so thats something to look foward to, especially if I see the barstool formally known as Scott Parker, to give him a piece of my mind.   Anyway, random joke time:   A young camel was bored one day and started asking his mother questions.  "Why do we have large three toed feet?"  "So we don't sink while walking in the soft sands of the desert," his mother replied.  "Why do we have long eyelashes?" was the next question.  To stop the sand of the desert storms getting in our eyes," was the exasperated reply.  Why do we have a large hump on our back?"  So we can cross the many miles of desert without needing water," his mother snapped.  So what the fuck are we doing in Chester zoo?"

      Ok, post number 2. Slightly more interesting day, I got told that I shall be venturing of on a school trip to Stamford Bridge, home of The Russian National Football Team. The trip costs 24 rubles and 2 sheep. With any luck, I will see the barstool formally known as Scott Parker. If so, I have devised a list of questions I could ask him.  1. When in primary school, did you play Judas in the Easter play? 2. Why are you such a devious back-stabbing tosser? 3. How does it feel to lose your place in the England team when supposedly leaving a small club to go to a bigger club? 4. Why did you throw back in Alan Curbishley's face, everything he has done for you, making you the player you are, just for a bit more money, you wanker?  So, I look forward to being able to direct my questions at the man, hopefully I will upset and embarrass him enough to take his own life by jumping off his wallet.

      What is up?  Its Wednesday, and I got absolutely fook all to do :(  So, here is a random joke:  2 young friends were playing football in the park, just outside Manchester, when out of nowhere, a savage beast of a dog attacked one of them that started to go for the throat and all that. His friend, however, managed to bring up all his courage and wrestled the dog off his friend, kills the dog and saved the day, and all that.   A reporter was walking past at the time, and was so impressed by this act of courage, that he offered to run the heroic story on page 1. So he went up to the boy and said, "I can see the headlines now. UNITED FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS BEAST." The boy replied, "But I don't support Man U." "Ok," said the reporter, "CITY HERO RESCUES MATE FROM SAVAGE ANIMAL." "I don't support City either," was the reply from the boy. "Who do you support then?" said the reporter. "I support Liverpool," came the reply. So, the next day, the headline said:   SCOUSE BARSTARD MURDERS FAMILY PET

      Random joke time, as i haven't posted for ages.    A doctor is doing the rounds in a mental hospital. He walks up to one of the rooms and sees the patient sitting on his bed making the noise of an engine.The doctor walks in and asks "Bill, what are you doing?" Bill looks up and replies "I'm a truck driver. I'm taking my wagon to France to get some cheap booze"   Slightly lost for words, the doctor leaves the room. As he walks up to the next room, all he can is hear is someone moaning and groaning. He looks in the next room and sees the patient lying on his bed, completely starkers, making love to his pillow! The doctor bursts in and shouts "Bob, what the hell are you doing?" Bob looks round and says   "I'm shagging Bill's wife while he's in France"

      Goddamn its late. Anywho, I've had a reasonably uneventful few days, accept for the fact that Charlton won up at Anfield for the first time in 50 years yesterday. But it is still a year too late for me, as I went up there last Easter Monday when we were winning 1-0 until the 86th minute when Liverpool scored twice, the wankers. 4 and a half hours it took to get home that night, in the cold and rain. Fucking scousers. At least we done the double over them this year, so I can give certain scousers a bit of stick, from a tree:)  So little time left until the big GCSEs. Have to just ride it out until then though, no killing oneself, as that would be the cowards way out. Plus I'm gonna get straight As anyway. No bent As in my house thank you very much.  Well, g'night.

      Finally, Easter Break is upon us. Here is a list of what a plan to do during these two weeks:  1. Nothing  So, as you can tell, I've got a lot to look forward to. I will probably go out and buy the new England Away shirt, so I might find oneself in Bomley within a few weeks. At least I have bought my Fulham Away tickets, so I can look forward to April 24th-25th ish.

           As I run this wonderful website, I feel a duty to provide a service, to educate my friends and colleague's, to inform you about what happens in the big wide world. And so here it goes. The Artificial Insemination of Cows, which in simpler terms means making your cow preggers without actually letting it have any action. This is done by getting some cow spunk, of a male cow, freezing it, and shoving it up some other cows arse.      unfortunately, this just isn't enough for some cow fuckers. They decide that the frozen spunk needs to thawed out a bit, so, they take the tube, and put it in their mouth. Its a bit yucky. And don't say I made this up, I've seen the video, and it wasn't one of those nudge nudge wink wink videos, I was shown it in Biology. And if that is not evidence enough, I've gone to the liberty of getting a picture for you.      Check out the scientists at the front, checking the semen in the microscopes, there well into it. And the smiling people in the top right, they cant wait to get up those cows' arses. And look at the women sitting on her own at the back, she wants to watch. Ooo yes, what a filthy whore. And look at the cows' faces, they're loving it, as they say at Macdonalds, which coincendently brings us to the end of our story, because thats were the cows finish up. So next time your enjoying your Big Mac with extra spunk, just remember the long and amazing journey that that cow has been on. Thank you.

       Ok, its ripthepissoutofthescousers.com at the moment, with the latest post supplied by Mark Colling- who takes all the credit, despite the fact its MY site.      It has just been announced that the Ferrari Formula 1 Team fired their entire Pit Crew yesterday. The action followed Ferrari's decision to take advantage of the British Government's Work For the Dole Scheme and hire unemployed youths from Liverpool.    The decision was brought on by a recent documentary on how unemployed Scousers were able to remove a set of car wheels in less than 6 seconds without proper equipment, whereas Ferrari's existing crew can only do It in 8 seconds with millions of pounds worth of high-tech gear.     This was thought to be an excellent and bold move by Ferrari management. As most F1  races are won and lost in the pits, Ferrari are seen to now have a massive advantage over every other team.    Ferrari got more than they bargained for, however, during the Scouse Crew's first practice session. Not only were they able to change the tyres in under 6 seconds but within 12 seconds they had also resprayed, rebadged, and sold the vehicle to the McLaren Team for four dozen cans of Special Brew, a gram of Coke and a quick shufty at Coulthard's bird in the shower.

       Hi, Newsflash about the important 2004 Olympic Games.    In an attempt to influence the members of the International Olympic Committee on their choice of venue for the games in 2004, should Greece fail in there attempt to build the stadium and competitor's village, the organisers of  Liverpool's bid have already drawn up an itinerary and schedule of events.   A copy has been leaked and is reproduced below.   OPENING CEREMONY   The Olympic flame will be ignited by a petrol bomb thrown by a native of  The city, wearing the traditional costume  Of shell suit, baseball cap and balaclava mask. It will burn for the  duration of the games in a large chip van situated on the roof of the stadium.   EVENTS   In previous Olympic games, Liverpool's competitors have not been  particularly successful. In order to redress the balance, some of the events  have been altered slightly to the advantage of local athletes.   100 METRES   Sprint competitors will have to hold a video recorder and a microwave oven  one under each arm and on the sound of the starting pistol, a police dog  will be released from a cage 10 yards behind the athletes.   100 METRES HURDLES   As above but with added obstacles e.g. car bonnets, hedges, garden fences, walls etc.   HAMMER   Competitors in this event may choose the type of hammer they wish to use  (claw, sledge etc.). The winner will be the one who can cause the most  grievous bodily harm to members of the public within the time allowed.   FENCING.   Entrants will be asked to dispose of as much stolen silver and jewellery as  possible in 5 minutes.   SHOOTING   A strong challenge is expected from the local men in this event. The first  target will be a moving police van. In the second round, the competitors  will aim at a post clerks, a bank teller or a wages delivery guard.   BOXING   Entry to this event will be restricted to husband and wife teams and will  take place on a Friday night The husband will be given 15 pints of Tennents  while the wife will be told not to make him any tea when he gets home. The  bout will then commence.   CYCLING TIME TRIALS   Competitors will be asked to break into the University bike shed and take an  expensive mountain bike owned by some mummy's boy from the country on his  first trip away from home. All against the clock.   CYCLING PURSUIT   As above but the bike will be owned by a visiting member of the Australian  rugby team who will witness the theft.   MODERN PENTATHLON   Amended to include mugging, breaking and entering, flashing, joy riding and arson.   SWIMMING   Competitors will be thrown off the Pier Head into the Mersey and the first  three survivors back will decide the medals.   MEN'S 50KM WALK   Unfortunately this will have to be cancelled as the police cannot Guarantee  the safety of anyone walking the streets of Liverpool.   THE CLOSING CEREMONY   Entertainment will include formation rave dancing by the members of the Liverpool Health in the Community anti-drug campaigners, synchronised brick  throwing. The Olympic flame will be extinguished by someone dropping an old washing machine onto it from the top  floor of the block of flats next to the stadium. The stadium will then be boarded up before the local athletes break into it and remove all of the  copper piping and the central heating boiler.

      A travelling salesman knocks on the door of a house. A kid, about 12 years old, answers the door. He's wearing a pink tutu, has a cigar in one hand, and a martini in the other.  The salesman is a little taken back, so he asks,  'Excuse me, son, are your parents home?'  The kid takes a big puff on the cigar and answers, 'What the f*** do you think?'

      A jumbo jet is just coming into the Toronto Airport on its final  approach. The pilot comes on the intercom, "This is your Captain.  We're on our final descent into Toronto. I want to thank you for flying with us today and I hope you enjoy your stay in Toronto".   He forgets to switch off the intercom, and the whole plane can hear his conversation with his co-pilot.   The copilot says to the pilot,  "Well, skipper, watch a gonna  do in Toronto?"   "Well," says the skipper,  "first I'm gonna check into the  hotel and take a big crap . . . . .then I'm  gonna take that  new stewardess with the huge tits out for dinner . . . . .   then I'm gonna wine and dine her, take her back to my room  and put it to her big time all night long!"   Everyone on the plane hears this and  immediately begins  looking up and down the isles trying to get a look at the new stewardess. Meanwhile the new stewardess is at the very  back of the  plane. She's so embarrassed that she tries to  run to the cockpit to turn the  intercom off. Halfway down  the aisle, she trips over an old lady's bag and  falls on  her face.  The old lady leans over and says: "No need to hurry,  dear.  He's gonna take a shit  first."

      Little Johnny is excited because the circus has come to town and his mum has  got front row tickets for him. Finally the evening comes and Little Johnny  and his mum go off to the big top. Little Johnny sits there and enjoys the  lions and the tigers and the jugglers and the trapeze artists, and finally  out comes little Johnnys favourites, the clowns.  Johnny is loving the clowns and their humorous japes until one of the clowns  comes up to him and says 'Little boy are you the front end of an ass?'  'No,' replies little Johnny. 'Are you the rear end of an ass?' 'No,' replies little Johnny again. 'In that case,' says the clown, 'you must be no end of an ass.'  Little Johnny is distraught and he runs out of the circus and all the way  home in tears. When his mum catches up with him she says, 'Little Johnny  don't worry, your Uncle Marvo, the master of lightning wit, backchat and  repartee, is coming to stay tomorrow. We will take him to the circus and he  will sort that nasty clown out.' At this news little Johnny cheers up and  looks forward to the next night.  The next night comes and, sure enough, Uncle Marvo, the master of lightning  wit, backchat and repartee arrives and the three of them set off for the  circus. When they get there Little Johnny, his mum and Uncle Marvo, the  master of lightning wit, backchat and repartee, sit down and enjoy the  lions, the tigers, the jugglers and the trapeze artists, and then out come  the clowns.  Again Little Johnny is enjoying their antics and yet again one of the clowns  comes up to him and says, 'Little boy are you the front end of an ass?'  Quick as a flash, Uncle Marvo, the master of lightning wit, backchat and  repartee jumps up and shouts at the very top of his voice:  'Fuck off you Red nosed Twat!'

      Hello, my name is Louis. I suffer from the guilt of not forwarding 50 billion f**king chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on, a poor 6-year-old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her to a traveling freak show.  Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you, and everyone to whom you send "his" email, $1000? How stupid are we?  "Ooooh, looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get laid by every good looking model in the magazine!" What a load of bull. Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my house and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing a chain that was started by Peter in 5 AD and brought to the USA by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower. Sod them.  If you're going to forward something, at least send me something mildly amusing. I've seen all the "send this to 10 of your closest friends, and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a nickel from some omniscient being" forwards about 90 times. I don't care.  Show a little intelligence and think about what you're actually contributing to by sending out these forwards. Chances are, it's your own unpopularity.  The point being? If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you sexless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it. If it's funny, send it on. Don't piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth who has been tied to a dead elephant for 27 years and whose only salvation is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this email.  Oh, by the way all you idiots out there...NO COMPANY HAS ANY WAY OF TRACKING E-MAIL OUTSIDE THEIR SYSTEM -NO, NOT EVEN MICROSOFT!!! THERE IS NO SUCH TECHNOLOGY YET!!!!!! AND IF THERE WERE, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AGAINST THE LAW TO TRACK IT FOR PRIVACY MATTERS.  Now forward this to everyone you know. Otherwise, tomorrow morning your underwear will turn carnivorous and will consume your genitals.

      A 7 year old and a 5 year old are upstairs in their bedroom. " You know what" says the 7 year old, "I think its about time we started swearing".  The 5 year old nods his head in approval. "When we go downstairs I am going to swear first, then you swear after me"  "ok" the 5 year agrees with enthusiasm  The mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 7 year old what he wants for breakfast "Oh Shit mum I guess I'll have cocoapops"  WHACK  He flew out of his chair, tumbled across the kitchen floor, got up and run off crying his eyes out. She looked at the 5 year old and asks him sternly "And what do YOU want for Breakfast young man?"  "I dont know" he blubbers, "but you can bet your Fucking arse it wont be cocoa pops"

        50th post, and my last for a couple of weeks as I am off to France. Its a good joke though:       &nbsp;   Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham are standing in Heaven before the throne of God. God looks at them and says; "And so here you are to face your Lord and maker. I shall ask each of you a question."       &nbsp;   &nbsp;Addressing Ronaldo first he asks, "Ronaldo, one of the world's greatest football players, what is it that you believe brought you here before me?" Ronaldo looks God in the eye and says passionately, "I believe football to be the food of life. Nothing else brings such unbridled joy to so Many people, from the slums of Rio to the bright lights of Madrid. I have devoted my life to bring such joy to people, with little else, who stood on the terraces supporting their team." God smiles and offers Ronaldo a seat to his left.&nbsp;He then turns to Luis Figo, "       &nbsp;   And similarly you, Luis, a hero to so many, what do you think it was brought you to my throne?" Figo stands tall and proud, "I believe courage, honour and passion are the fundamentals to life and I've spent my whole playing career providing a living embodiment of these commitments." God, moved by the passion of his speech offers Figo a seat to his right.&nbsp;       &nbsp;   He then turns to Beckham, "And you, David. Presumably you want your ball back?

       One day a guy got invited to his girlfriend's parents' house for dinner. He really liked the girl and wanted to impress her parents. When he arrived at the girl's house he was quickly whisked into the dining room where they were getting ready to sit down for dinner. He sat down in his chair and the family dog curled up under him. Halfway through dinner the man felt a rumble in his guts.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;He was very uncomfortable so he let a little bit out hoping no-one would notice. As soon as he finished his discreet trouser-guffaw, the girl's father yelled at the dog, "Rufus!"     &nbsp;  The guy thought, "Hey, this is great!" and let out a little bit more.Once again, the girl's father yelled, "Rufus!" The guy decided to let all the wind out since the father thought it was the dog.     &nbsp;  After he let a really long chuffer out of the back door, the girl's father yelled at the dog, "RUFUS!! Get out from under that chair - now! Before that man craps on you!!"

        The Warning Signs of Insanity...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Everyone you meet appears to have tentacles growing out of places that you wouldn't expect tentacles to be growing from.    &nbsp;  You start out each morning with a 30-minute jog around the bathroom.    &nbsp;  You write to your mother in Germany every week, even though she sends you mail from&nbsp;Milton Keynes&nbsp;asking why you never write.    &nbsp;  Every time you see a street sign, you have a tremendous urge to relieve yourself on it.    &nbsp;  You wear your boxers on your head because you heard it will ward of evil dandruff spirits.    &nbsp;  You're always having to apologize to your next door neighbour for setting fire to his lawn decorations.    &nbsp;  Every commercial you hear on the radio reminds you of death.    &nbsp;  People stay away from you whenever they hear you howl    &nbsp;  .Your breath smells more and more like squirrel dung each passing day.    &nbsp;  Nobody listens to you anymore, because they can't understand you through that scuba mask.    &nbsp;  You begin to stop and consider all of the blades of grass you've stepped on as a child, and worry that their ancestors are going to one day seek revenge.    &nbsp;  You have meaningful conversations with your toaster.    &nbsp;  Your father pretends you don't exist, just to play along with your little illusion.You collect dead windowsill flies.    &nbsp;  Every time the phone rings, you shout, "Hey! An angel just got its wings!"    &nbsp;  You like cats. Especially with mayo.    &nbsp;  You cry at the end of every episode of Gilligan's Island because they weren't rescued.    &nbsp;  You put tennis balls in the microwave to see if they'll hatch.    &nbsp;  You have a predominant fear of fabric softener.Your dentist asks you why each individual tooth has your name etched on it, and you tell him it's for security reasons.    &nbsp;  Melba toast excites you.    &nbsp;  When the waiter asks for your order, you ask to go into another room to tell him because "the napkins have ears."    &nbsp;  You tend to agree with everything your mother's dead uncle tells you.    &nbsp;  You argue with yourself about which is better, to be eaten by a koala or to be loved by an infectious disease.    &nbsp;  You like to sit in cornfields for prolonged periods of time, and pretend that you're a stalk.    &nbsp;  You try to make a list of the Warning Signs of Insanity. (cough)    &nbsp;  People offer you help, but you unfortunately interpret this as a violation of your rights as a boysenberry.    &nbsp;  You keep thinking this is the year for the&nbsp;Oldham Athletic.    &nbsp;  You despise the voices in your head, especially the one that speaks only Hindi.    &nbsp;  You see migrating flocks of ducks in the fall and only your attachment to the toaster keeps you from joining them.    &nbsp;  The person you always talk to is invisible to everyone but you.    &nbsp;  You like reading lists like this.

      Thank you to Laingbri on the AOL jokes board for this joke which will make you pmsl, hopefully not in the shower though :)  HOW TO SHOWER LIKE A WOMAN  Take off clothing and place it in sectioned laundry basket according to whites and coloureds. Walk to bathroom wearing long dressing gown.  If you see husband along the way, cover up any exposed areas.  Look at your womanly physique in the mirror - make mental note to do more sit-ups.  Get in shower. Use face cloth, arm cloth, leg cloth, long loofah, wide loofah and pumicestone.  Wash hair once with cucumber and sage shampoo with 43 added vitamins.  Wash hair again to make sure it is clean.  Condition hair with grapefruit mint conditioner enhanced with natural avocado oil, leave on hair for 15 minutes.  Wash face with crushed apricot facial, scrub for 10 minutes until red.  Wash entire rest of body with ginger-nut and jaffa cake body wash. Shave armpits and legs.  Turn off shower. Dry off all wet surfaces in shower, spray mould spots.  Get out of shower. Dry with towel the size of a small country. Wrap hair in super absorbent towel.  Return to bedroom wearing long dressing gown and towel on head. If you see husband along the way, cover any exposed areas.    HOW TO SHOWER LIKE A MAN......  Take off clothes while sitting on the edge of the bed leave in a pile.  Walk naked to the bathroom if you see wife along the way - shake knob at her making woo-hoo sound.  Look at manly physique in the mirror, admire size of knob and scratch your a*se.  Get in the shower.  Wash your face. Wash your armpits. Blow your nose in your hands and let the water rinse it off.  Make fart noises (real or artifical) and laugh at how loud they sound in the shower.  Spend majority of time washing privates and surrounding area. Wash your bum, leaving four pubes stuck on the soap.  Shampoo hair. Make shampoo mohawk. Pee.  Rinse off and get out of the shower. Partially dry off.  Fail to notice water on the floor. Admire knob size in mirror again.  Leave shower door open, leave wet mat on the floor, leave light and fan on.  Return to bedroom with towel around waist. If you pass wife, pull off towel, shake knob at her and make woo-hoo noise, again.  Throw wet towel on bed.

      Be very proud to be British Because...   Only in Britain... can a pizza get to your house faster than an  ambulance.   Only in Britain... do supermarkets make sick people walk all the way  to the back of the shop to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front.   Only in Britain... do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries, and a DIET coke.   Only in Britain... do banks leave both doors open and chain the pens to the counters.   Only in Britain... do we leave cars worth thousands of pounds on the drive and lock our junk and cheap lawn mower in the garage.   Only in Britain... do we use answering machines to screen calls and then have call waiting so we won't miss a call from someone we didn't want to talk to in the first place.  NOT TO MENTION...   3 Brits die each year testing if a 9v battery works on their tongue.  142 Brits were injured in 1999 by not removing all pins from new shirts.   58 Brits are injured each year by using sharp knives instead of screwdrivers.   31 Brits have died since 1996 by watering their Christmas tree while the fairy lights were plugged in.   19 Brits have died in the last 3 years believing that Christmas decorations were chocolate.   British Hospitals reported 4 broken arms last year after cracker pulling accidents.    101 people since 1999 have had broken parts of plastic toys pulled out of the soles of their feet.   18 Brits had serious burns in 2000 trying on a new jumper with a lit cigarette in their mouth.   A massive 543 Brits were admitted to A&E in the last two years after opening bottles of beer with their teeth.   8 Brits were injured last year in accidents involving out of control Scalextric cars.   And finally.........   In 2000 eight Brits cracked their skull whilst throwing up into the toilet.   RULE BRITANNIA!! AND THE GREAT BRITISH BEAN!

      Tips  Before attempting to remove stubborn stains from a garment always circle the stain in permanent pen so that when you remove the garment from the washing machine you can easily locate the area of the stain and check that it has gone.  High blood pressure sufferers: Simply cut yourself and bleed for a while, thus reducing the pressure in your veins.  Olympic athletes. Conceal the fact that you have taken performance enhancing drugs by simply running a little slower and letting someone else win.  Heavy smokers: Don't throw away those filters from the end of your cigarettes. Save them up and within a few years you'll have enough to insulate your attic.  Create instant designer stubble by sucking a magnet and dipping your chin in a bowl of iron fillings.  X File fans: Create the effect of being abducted be aliens by drinking two bottles of vodka. You'll invariably wake up in a strange place the following morning, having had your memory mysteriously 'erased'.  A sheet of sandpaper makes a cheap and effective substitute for costly maps when visiting the Sahara desert.  Convince neighbors that you have invented a 'SHRINKING' device by ruffling your hair, wearing a white laboratory coat and parking a massive truck outside your house for a few days. Then dim and flicker the lights in your house during the night and replace the big truck unseen, with a Tonka toy of the same description. Watch their faces in the morning!  Nissan Micra drivers: Attach a lighted sparkler to the roof of your car before starting a long journey. You drive the things like dodgem cars anyway, so it may as well look like one.  Tape a chocolate bar to the outside of your microwave. If the chocolate melts you will know that the microwaves are escaping and it is time to have the oven serviced.  A mouse trap, placed on top on of your alarm clock will prevent you from hitting the snooze button, rolling over and going back to sleep.

      People Who Should Be Phased Out...  * People who always harmonize the last few notes of "Happy Birthday."  * People over 40 who can't put on reading glasses without making self-conscious remarks about their advancing age.  * People who wink when they're kidding.  * Men who propose marriage on the giant TV screen at a sports stadium.  * A celebrity couple who adopt a Third-World baby and call it Rain Forest.  * People who have memorised a lot of TV-show theme songs and are really proud of it.  * Women who think it's really cute to have first names consisting solely of initials or three names.  * People who give their house or car a name.  * People who can juggle, but only a little bit.  * Actors who drive race cars.  * People who wear watches on the inside of their wrists.

       We got Danny Murphy!!!!!! We got Franny Jeffers!!!!! We got Dennis Rommedahl!!!!! We gonna kick sum ARSE!!!!!      Here's a joke for you funny people, thanks to Miss T      A lady goes to her priest one day and says, "Father, I have a problem. I have two female parrots, but they only know how to say one thing."       "What do they say?" the priest inquired. "They say, 'Hi, we're hookers! Do you want to have some fun?'" "That's obscene!" the priest exclaimed, and then, he thought for a moment. "You know," he said, "I may have a solution to your problem. I have two male  talking  parrots, which I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house, and we'll put them in the cage with Frank and Jacob.       My parrots can teach your parrots to pray and worship, and your parrots are sure to stop saying that horrible thing-in no time at all." "Thank you," the woman responded, "this may very well be the solution to my problem."       The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw that his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding rosary  beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.         After a few minutes, the female parrots cried out in unison: "Hi, we're hookers! Do you want to have some fun?" There was stunned silence. Shocked, one male parrot looked over at the other male parrot and exclaimed, "Put the beads away, Frank. Our prayers have been answered ."
