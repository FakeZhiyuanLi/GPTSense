       Today at lunch I thought it would be good idea to go and deposit my cheque considering that my balance was at a whopping $0.33. Now as of recently I have been trying to avoid my bank at all costs (which I probably should have stuck with today). You see not too long ago I was talking to one of the tellers at my branch.Everything was going fairly good for a while... that is until someone started telling people, that I was telling people that I was sleeping with her. Confused? Yeah me too. Anyhoo, she tells me that I ruined her life, she hates me Yada yada yada. Long story short I hate going to the bank out of fear that shes gonna be my teller and accidentally loose my cheque.. But I digress from my main point. Today was different... I thought I was gonna be slick and use the express deposit inside the bank and avoid the tellers all together. Damn Im a genious! So walk in and I make a beeline directly to that little island thingy with the deposit slips and proceed to fill one out. As Im filling it out I look up and see one of the hottest Latina chikas that Ive seen in a while, and shes also filling out a deposit slip. So Im playin it cool and Im sneakin a peek every once in a while hoping to make eye contact with this girl.  Id say it was probably on my third or fourth attempt and SCORE!!.. I make eye contact …….. well kinda.  As I glace up at her our eyes meet I smile, she smiles and I turn and run right the fuck out of the bank.   You see kids I learned two things on my trip to the bank today.   #1. The phrase “eye contact” immediately needs to be changed to “eyes contact”. Why would you want to that for Larry? You ask. Well you see I made “eye contact” today  with that girl in the bank…as in a single eye.  The other one just happened to be made out of glass.  #2. I need direct deposit ASAP.

       So today was laundry day. Now I usually dont do my laundry on a weekday, but today was a special situation. You see I havent done laundry for damn near a month and I ran out of draws to day. Thats right I was forced to wear " the last pair of draws".. You know what Im talkin about..... the pair of boxer briefs with a hole in the crotch..... You don't??? .....Ok so i have big thighs and they rub.  Back to my story.  I pack everything into my laundry bag to take to Nana's house and I head for the door. Like I said before its been a while since I had last done laundry, so as you can imagine I had quite a bit of clothing stuffed into this back. Now Ive always considered myself a pretty stong guy, but I swear to God this thing had to weigh close to 200lbs. So being the lazy ass that I am I decide to drag it down the stairs instead of carrying it......WRONG!!!  As I head downstairs I take one step, then two.  I go to place my foot down on the third and BAM!!!! down I go like a fuckin ton of bricks. Turns our when I  took that third step the laundry bag swung and hit me in the back of my right knee.. Luckily for me with my cat-like reflexes I was able to  land squarely on my right shoulder and elbow.  Fuck my shoulder hurts!  Oh well... at least I got some clean undies now.

       Friday night Jules and I decide we are gonna hit up downtown get a couple drinks. You know not to get really hammered or anything, just to chill out and relax after a long week of not doing any work.  Anyhoo we decide Lala will be our first destination of the night...So there we are at Lala, Im getting our drinks and who do I see but Maria Vecchi. Normally I would say hi, go up to her give her a hug an what not. But I had just stood her up for a date that Tuesday and I didn't really feel like having 95lbs. of pissed off Columbian chika up my ass . ( I know Im a prick) So I casually pretended not to see her and continued with the drink purchase. Quick  side note- Maria is a nice girl ,but she has the personality of a wet cigarette.   So after about 45 minutes or so of strategically positioning myself between Maria, Jules, and a wall we decided that we should head across to Mucky and hang out there for a little bit. It turns out Red Hook is having a promotional event due to it being* Jamaican Independence day, and Red Stripe beers are $2.00. How can I resist? I get us a couple beers, we sit, we chat, and in walks Luten with her cousins. Now Lu is a huge blast from the past. My last couple years of high school we kinda had a thing for each other, there was allot of heavy flirting, some groping and yes even some making out. But things never got too far. She had a boyfriend ( who is now her baby's dad) and I had plans to go off to college ( which never happened). So long story short I havent talked to this chick in almost 5 years.  Back to the story. When she walked through the door I immediately caught her eye, she came over asked if I was gonna go out back, I said yes and that was pretty much it for that night. I was too chicken shit to approach her, and turns out she thought Jules was my girl so she didnt approach me.  That brings us to tonight. I had just finished working out and my cell rings. I didnt recognize the #, but it wasnt blocked so I answer. Here is a quick edited version of the conversation  Me: Hi Her: Hi Me: Who dis? Her: Lu Me: Hi?? Her: Wut u doin? Me: Workin out? Her: Weekend? Me: nuthin why? Her: Wanna do sumthin? Me: Erick ???( her X) Her: No more Me: That sux Her: So? Me:lemme get back to you Her: ok Me: ok bye  So heres the dilemma. As the title of this blog states she is infact a mommy. Regardless if I go or not a relationship with her is completely out of the question. Im sorry but Im not taking care of someone else's kid. But on the other hand would a date really hurt? ... I mean there is about a %75-%80 chance that I'll get laid if I do go... but I dont want hurt her feelings or anything by pullin a straight b0ne and go.  To skeet or not to skeet? That is the question .... Help me out ya'll  * This is no joke, there actually is a Jamaican independence day. Turns out all that it commemorates was the day that some guy named Shabba beat up a chicken for eating his stash. Shabba we salute you!

        I pee allot …..In fact Im pretty sure that I pee more than any one human being should in one day. “Why do you pee so much Larry?” you ask. Well for one I drink damn near a gallon of water every day at work… now you may be thinking to yourself “ Damn that’s a shit load of water” .. And you know what your probably right. But I get really thirsty so fuck off…Secondly I just started taking some new diet pills. For those who aren’t in the  know, one of the main things that diet pills do aside from giving you heart attacks is they act as a diuretic. Not diuretic as in “ I farted but Im pretty sure I just shit myself” but more of a “ Every time I pee its clear” diuretic.  So where am I getting at… Ok so here’s the story .  On one of my many trips to the bathroom today I witnessed something that took me as being a bit strange. As Im walking into the bathroom to use the urinal there is a elderly gentleman doing his business as usual. Now this isn’t ordinarily out of place but this old guy had a technique for wizzing into a urinal that I personally have never seen used in practice. Now most guys myself included will hold their wang with one hand directing the flow of wee-wee while allowing their free hand to either hold their pants to prevent  getting piss on them, or to support themselves by using it as a brace against the wall. This old guy did neither.     As I walked into the restroom  I glance over at the old fellow and I swear to God  he was taking a leak using NO HANDS!!!!… Imagine if you will an old white guy at least 70 years of age taking a wee while mid Macarena. I couldn’t believe it. Now I know the majority of people reading the Blog ( Grace, Jules) Have never had the pleasure of being able to pee standing up. Well let me tell you this you need to control your dong when you pee.. Believe me I know… Ive tried the No hand technique before out of sheer morbid curiosity. Let me put it this way, have you ever turned on a water hose full blast while having left it unattended?  Yeah that’s what its like… not a pretty sight I assure you.  But some how this dirty old man was able to pull it off with out getting a drop on my shoes.. Hell I guess 70 years of experience may have helped a little bit.
