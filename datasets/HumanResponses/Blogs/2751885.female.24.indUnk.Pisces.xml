      Well IM just listening to some old Belle and Sebastian, and IM thinking way too much. Its reminding me of times gone past. And IM getting too old. Funny story, my dad looks at me yesterday and asks me how old I am, and I say 24. He was amazed, he thought I was 21 going on to 22. Pretty funny. My birthday was a bust, I worked all day, went to the nutritionist at 8:30am, and I haven't gained anything, I really don't get it. Yeah so think I did nothing all night, My friend A gave me a call, he gave me two prints of his (really nice and contemporary) and some underwear. But all was well, Elliott wrote me an email whising me a good b-day, and offering to buy me a drink this weekend. IM trying not to be attracted to him, its hard, ironic don't you think. Well thats about it for now.

      The weekend was indescribable. Friday night was the best. I met my friend Elliott at the bar, we were the only ones there. So he played his guitar for me, and then we played tribond with the bartender. After that we went to Donatella Versace's house were there were tons of familar faces, but I knew few names. So me and Elliott were being anti social and just chatting all night. I heart Elliott, I was giving him advice about meeting girls. But secertlly I wished he would ask me back to his room. As well we talked about a lot of things, art, third world countries, and being adopted. I must say it was a good night, I really like getting to know the straight boys. I went home around four thirty. And I did the responsible son thing and took a cab home. I just couldn't call my parents that late, even though I know they would have picked me up. Im spoiled like that. But now that i think about it, I should of went to elliotts room to use the phone, and maybe something unexpected would of happened, hmmmm I'll never know. Anyway that's about it.

      So I just went through some of my old art work.  I usually do this one every year to remains of times gone by. And I must say I was impressed.  No head swelling here. I was impressed that I actually did all this work, I made these images.  And I think to myself "where the fuck has this person gone. . . Who was he?".  I don't know.  Lately I've been wrapped up with work and trying to get my mind to land.  Its seems like I never get this low blood sugar thing.  Oh to make matters worse I lost a couple of pounds, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  I would love to seriously just leave, that's it just stop everything and leave. Hmm. . .  Im the type to think way too much. Looking at the art that I produced got me inspired. I keep telling myself that I should rent out the studio. Well I should, I just don't know what's stopping me from doing it. That and applying to school.

      hey ya'll hows it been? Me? Oh you know how it is. So this is it the big old blog.  Well then. I decided to hop on the blog wagon because it seemed like a nice way to stay in contact with my friend stacy.  Now stacey you can know all the things that are happing in my small life. oh and as well other people are welcome.  so this is it. I don't have much to say, well there is this one thing.  I think I find relegious guys to be really cute. What the hell am I talking about? you may ask. Well these two young guys came into the store that i work in and they were wearing white shirts, gray pants and ties, they were two cute, okay maybe to much acne but you know there was somthing very sexy aobut it. I think its because its so forbidden.  Hmm I think it would be so hot to seduce a little religous boy and make out with him in churh te he.  anyway thats my little bit of something for tody, maybe i should join a religous group hmmmm its an idea

      I have three blogs that I now have to be clever for...I don't think I have that much cleverness to go around. but we'll soon find out just how clever clever is!!!  so this band thing is really takeing off eh? Some of our friends are trying to get i on the band action, which is cool! but...you shouldn't be like "hey, alisha said I could be in your band is that cool"...when in fact alisha said nooooo such thing.like...dude start your own electro-raunch band and stop trying to hone in on our talents for writing great songs!!!!  heh...you know who you are!

      stacey! i thought it would be cool to have a communal blog where we could post together. in fact, we should get other people in on it too. or maybe it can just be for our band and for us. i don't know. but communal blogs rock. what do ya say?

      so...we on way back into the "studio" (meaning alisha's room) to rerecord some of our songs we didn't really like the first time around...such as it's so hard..and pornado. pornado will be a lot thesame with the same words and the same beat...hopefully, but will just be better. it's strange to me that people we know sorta but not really have been checking out our.  we had a guy we sorta know through school/friends (we both know him throught different people) came u[p to us and was like I really liked pornado!..that felt cool  it felt like that for one qucik second in time I was famous......  nah it was actually kinda weird and creepy that someone we didn't really know knew who we were. well I was creeped out anyway.  but it's back to the note books for me to start on some lyrics for some new songs. we need to get ths party started!!   w00t

      so, we've been doing a lot of  recording ourselves being silly to regular beatas these past few weeks. It's been fun and some of it I think we're going to put as a hidden song at the end of our first album. we sing silly songs and make fun of each other and our friends. it's good times.  that's about it really. I think I might go over to alisha's house to rerecord some old songs that we don't really like that much. for example,...pornado can be sooo much better!!!

      So here I am on a thursday night struggling to get the work I had all week to do in one night. I mean I'm fucked really. I can never get all work done in time. but now here I am typing in my blog. My friend dave told me that I was a professional procrastinator. He's right...  And I hate to admit it. I hate being a procrastinator.And knowing it is way worse. B/c I know that I have work to do and I'm just going to put it off til' the last minute. I suck really.    I'm in the mood to date someone casually. now to find someone who takes things as unseriously as I do but with all the drama.. B/c I do love a little drama.

      so, It's fucking crazy out today and it felt like most ppl were "smart" enough to take the subway. Well I'm coming home and the subway is packed like freeze dried apricots, and the train is moving so slow it was like we were going backwards, The Driver comes on the over speaker:  "attn: all males on the train.......all males.........please get up .......and give you seat to a lady, it's going to be a long ride."  Everyone on the train was laughing. it was really cool. I mean nobody got up, but I have been on the subway at slower times and have never had that happen to me before. It made me feel so good. And when I was getting off he came on again:  Atten: to all passengers...This is the driver of this train. I just want to apoligize for the delay I know you all want ot go home. And it is taking a long time. I just want to say thank-you for being patient and I'm really sorry it's taking so long."  This was the nicest guy ever!! Like holy fuck.....  I wish that ttc guy would read my random internet blog. I would thank him for being so fucking cool. It makes the trip a lot nicer and makes a person feel better!!!!  Man I hate the snow.......

      I love this new look thus that I can thank alisha this new look. Alisha thank-you. If you to estalar on its anme then you go for the right its place. Which is fulled with all the types of the wonderful material. As it pictures and crap. Thus I sat down around my house all the night and ate the ice cream. I love the ice cream. I all seated and gave to attention the wind and snow and thought of warm thoughts and ate tub of caralho of all! this is right.......... approval, well that I ate very. Perhaps not it entire thing. This would make me sick. Cream swims likes it ice in one day cold, when its inside and the cold is for is. I never want to leave another time. He above turns the heat, all the lights on, he puts on mine sunglasses and suite to bathe itself, and imagines them that I live reallly in some warm place. As Mexico, in some place dosen't of the water only gives to me to the deirrhea or the some another one diease.

      so I can thank  urlLink alisha  for this new look. Thank-you alisha urlLink  . If you click on her anme then you go right to her site. Which is filled with all kinds of wonderful stuff. Like her pictures and crap.   So I sat around my house all night and ate ice cream. I love Ice cream. I sat and watched all the wind and snow and thought warm thoughts and ate the whole fucking tub!!! that's right..........  ok, well I ate a lot. Maybe not the whole thing. That would have made me sick.  Nothing like Ice cream on a cold day, when your in and the cold is out.  I never want to go out again. Turn the heat up, the lights all on, put on my sunglasses and bathing suite, and imagine I reallly live someplace warm. Like mexico, only somewhere the water dosen't give me deirrhea or some other diease.

      Last week I came home to find my answering machine no longer spoke to me. It was mute...I was sad. I sat on the floor and had a little cry while cradling it in my arms. Then I called my friend alisha to help sooth my broken heart. After that was over, I went to the mall to replace my old friend.  I got the new machine home...Plugged it in....And...NOTHING. It was a dud. I was upset, but shed no tears, I mean after all we barely knew each other!!!  Today I went to get yet another answering machine. And you'll be happy to know it works. So you can call my house and 14 minutes of wonderful message fun.  I think I peed a little...........  So that was my day. The mall was hell as it always is. Anyway....

      hi, my name is stacey janes. ppl often tell em it sounds fake.....like rubber cheese.  I often wonder if people are looking in my window at me when I sit here on my computer and type in the nude. And then I think if that's what they wanna do then maybe I should open my curtains and so they can get the full effect. Or I could look out the window and post a sign to invite them in.   or maybe not. I'm a little self-conscience about that kinda shit.

      so here I am at home in newfoundland.yeah it's all the fun I remember. I went to a 'rave' last night.it was more like a HS dance party.sad really, but I must say I had a really good time.I did kiss this boy I had a super crush on when I was in HS. I know that was a long time agos, but it still felt like a small triumph. c'mon you know what I mean.That whole you didn't want me then but I can have anytime I want now. I know it's ot really like that but it made me fel really good. he kept telling me I felt nice. I'm not sure what that was suppose to mean...but it sounds good.It made my knees weak a little. good times.  yeah so the first two days I was here I was totally snowed in, it was a weird experience. I'm not used to having to limb moutains of snow to rent a video. I really wanted to take a picture of all the snow....then in clicked in ....I grew up here, I should be used to this!!!..I felt really touristy. And that was followed by the need to still take a picture of all this fucking snow!!!  I'm sitting here watching the christina agulira special. she's really dumb but wants ppl to think that she's not that dumb. She wrote a song about double standards.......but it's really stupid and makes no sense. Like brittany writing a song about what it feels like to be rich and how it's really hard!!!! wtf. I hate them both.   just b/c I hate boys dosen't mean I'm a lesbian.......my friend baden read that somewhere.but it applys to me I think.   alisha and amy....I miss you!

So you pay half ...then all you hair falls out....what's the point?

      so I went out on saturday with my good friend alisha.We went to the bovine sex club, and this guy started doing all these fucked up card tricks. it was craziness.I was holding the card....and then so was he!!!   ok ok...I was a little drunk it's true.But he really did all this crazy stuff and when I asked hi what he did for a living....he was in insurence!!! I was amazed and throughly impressed.  So I am so anti-love at this point. Boys never seem to know what they want and then when you tell them wht you want they always want something different but really want the same thing you want but don't want you to know because you may want something more then that!!!!  you got all that!  so after the bovine we went ot the velvet underground. It was last call so I went on up to the bar to get a last beer. I was wearing these cute little bunny ears...it was cute. anyway..there was this guy there and he kept saying things to me that I couldn'r hear b/c he was all drunk and slurry. And then he gave me all this money..he may or maynot have thought I was hooker in my ears..and he kept trying to lick my neck. It was really gross. and then he asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said I did.....well I had a grrlfriend. so then I thought "fuck the beer it's not worth it really", and I went to find my friends.  so we are all dancing and what not. and ho appears...the gross creepy guy. he keeps grabbing my arm and pulling me. So I start making out with amy..my close and dear friend..but he starts licking me!!!I think I threw up a little. I had to sit in the corner and haev my friends around me before he would leave me alone. thank you friends.  boys are so fucking stupid. I wish I was a lesbian. I wish it everyday.

      ok so for one my friend dave asked me if I ever write about him in my blog and I sadi no......he seemed a littl disapointed. So here it is Dave your 15 min. Your in my blog. I think your awsome and I would totally make-out with you even thought you think I'm kidding when I ask you that repeatedly.  ok so here the real reason for this blog entry. I'm addicted to 6 feet under. You know that HBO series. I don't have cable but DAVE owns the first season, and one day we were hanging out at his house we started to watch it....big mistake. I can't get enough and as soon as I start watching it it's really hard for me to stop. So everytime I go over there and he's like ok we can watch one episode....well it turns into like three.And the sad part is I never get bored. Sweet Jesus.........I could sit and watch it for hours. I could honsetly sit and watch the whole first season right through no breaks. I can't fathom having to wait a week to see the next episode!!! 3 hours of it just isn't long enough.  I realized yesterday I love jesus jokes. well not jokes about jesus.....but like when ppl say things like "sweet jesus" that is some good fucking pie!!!  you know what I mean.

      yeah so I feel like I haven't been up to much so why update the ol'blog if your life's boring as hell. but yet here I am. becca this is for you(b/c I know you read this)  yeah so friday I did the grl thing and sat aroud my house reading cosmo magazine. Man it's been awhile for the cosmo. I really forgot how fucking horrible it is. I always had the impression that it was the only decent grrl magazine. But no......  It just has all the same adds and "dose he love you- here's how to tell" quiz's. I was reading one such quiz.....how to tell if you in love. It asked the stupidest questions like if you would cheat and if you got giddy when you saw him and such. I mean c'mon ladies it's not rocket science that if you would cheat on your guy, or if you dread seeing him, then your not in love with him. But way to pay 8 bucks for cosmo to tell you that.  I went to the bovine sex club last night. For the first time, I made add! Man that is the fuckin' coolest bar on earth. It made me feel cool just to be there.Threr were all kinds of grrls there who had crazy coloured hair...It was Awsome. Of coures there were the old burnout rocker guys that were super gross and just came to pick up young grrls. but on the whole it was a pretty cool fuckin place. And to the bartender with the pink hair....I Love You!!!!!!  oh man!!! there was this guy there who we think may have been famous...(but we're not sure.) He was like, really ugly but in that way that you can't stop staring at him. I couldn't keep my eyes off him. he was intrigiingly hidious. Yeah he probably thought I was into him. he looked like a cross between chunk (from the goonies........hheeyy yyoouuu gguuyyss!!!!!!) and Axcel Ross. It was truly starable.  ahh...good times, good times. I also love if you think I'm sexy by the revolting coks!!!Man I'm telling you I'm addicted to it. I can't get enough.

      yeah so I had my ex call the police on me....why?  well I don't really know why. I call him on friday to ask a question (it made sense at the time), and he called the police on monday, becasue aparently I was harassing him!!!!. It was really strange because I hadn't talked to him in three months. We didn't fight or have anything angry to say to one another.  But I figure he's crazy. and that's the end of that. weird he called the police on me for nothing..........What a waste of time. I sent him a strongly worded e-mail...and made sure not to put in anything he could use against me in a court of law. But that was the end of it ...........I hope.

      so, almost everyday this strange asian womans calls my house. When I pick up the phone she automatically starts talking in some language I don't understand. I feel like I'm interupting her just to tell her she has the wrong number. But she dosen't say "can I speak to.." or at least I don't think she dose? Anyway there is no break for a long time so I alaways have to cut her off mid-sentence to tell her she has not called who she think she called. She also leaves long strange messasges on my answering machine.  If a day goes by and she dosen't call....I miss her a little bit.

      you kow when your a teenager and you dye your hair so much that people often say that your hair is going to fall out? ok....if your someone like me you know what I'm talking about... well it's true. I bleached it and it started to fall out ...then I had to get it al cut off. Now I look kinda like a little boy with pink hair. I like the pink part ...but not the looking like a boy part.

      ok, so I orderd the BLACK EYES cd from the internet, b/c you can't buy it in the store!!! and anyway not only is it the best cd/band ever, but they included all the words in the cd sleeve. I just want to say I love it when bands/singers do that. We all love to sing along, (yes you too!) I just felt like I was getting abonus in the cd.I think everybody should always include the words.ALWAYS. It really is the curtious thing to do  if your fans are going out of there way to buy/order you cd off the internet, then the least you caould do is allow me the pleasure of singiing along. Ok the truth is I would sing along anyway and would listen to the cd enough to learn the words, BUT......but you never know if it's the right words and by providing them it saves you the trouble of looking them up. Or in the case of black eyes....looking,not finding and crying in frustation.  I also want to add that black eyes is my new favorite band. They are soooo fucking A-m-a-z-i-n-g, but I want to know who dose all the background screaming, I've e-mailed dischord (label) and asked...but as of yet ther has been no response? and there is no grrl listed with the band...could it be  boy? it sounds like grrl screaming, but I just can't be sure. If you know anything about this ...please let my know...I would love you forever and send you a nice card in the mail.  thank-you

      So I was searching the net..like a loser. And I came across  urlLink this  It's really quit funny. Can you imagine sending your friend poo in the mail. Well I would never do that to my friends...but there a re a few people I have in mind...  I mena if you could send someone poo without them know ..would you? I certainly would. Are you fucking kidding me. There wuold be no better way to get back at my ex then to send him and his girlfriend a box of poo!!! that would be fucking great...  And then I got to thinking...who mails this stuff out. Who could yuo possibly pay to wrap, put in a box, and deliver someone else's poop?   And then threr was  urlLink this  Who would want to know all about poo? beats me. But I got to say I was interested enought to take a look. It is really fucking gross I gotta say, 'I really love the word 'poop' but actually have to read about it or getting it in the mail is kinda gross.  If any of you send me poo........ I will hate you and never talk to you again!!!!

      So I've been finding this past little while I refer everythign to being a train....like "your riding the ice tea train" if you are indeed drinking a lot of Ice tea. So it's like I'm on the train train. yeah. I'm also on the digital camera train. Becca baby has been letting me play with hers, so I just take pictures of all the randome things in our apartment and put them on my computer and then delete them. Or I have been practicing taking pics of myself..putting them on my computer and then..deleting them.I never keep any of these random pictures, but it's fun to play. Digital cameras were made by jesus..I swear. Nothing this great could come out a mere human.It had to be jesus.  speaking of jesus...I downloaded a jesus cursor. it's a little jesus head. It's fucking  jesusilicious!!! I could surf the net and look up whatever I want(porn) and know that he is with me!!!   I think I'm also on the jesus train.....I talk about him a lot, not in a " I'm giving my soul to jesus" way, but more in a not capitalizing his name jesusilicious way. you get what I'm trying to say?  not to knock jesus...I'm sure he was a great guy and all, and he did bring back the whole sandel thing.......birkenstock got nothin' on jesus....  I just realized....(well not just ) that I am going to hell. Hopefully in a handbasket,a pink one.

      yeah so I hd to delete all those fetish pics. they were really too big for this little blog and since I am kinda slow when it comes to fixing stuf,,and I don't have photshop, then it was eaasier to delete them. If you want me to send them yout to you I can..just give me your e-mail adress. I act like ppl I know read this blog..I'm pretty sure it's just alisha and spagetti.lol.  so anyway..that's it .

      So we were all hanging out at amy's last ight and the topic of children came up...I mean at our age normal people think about haveing kids..anyway we all agreed that we have been feeling the biological urge to have kids. Why do womyn feel this way? Do men feel this way? Do men get in there mid-twenties and think to themselves. you know i would really like my girlfriend to get pregnant? somehow I doubt it, I'm not say ing this doesn't happen b/c I'm sure some men feel that way. But I now for me it's like this deep seeded feeling in the back of my head and the pit of my ovaries, that I constantly have to retell myself all the reasons I don't REALLY want kids. I'm not responsible enough for a child for one thing..And for fuck sakes that's what I do all fucking day long!! And if I ever had kids they would be so fucked up. And I just know I would tell them all these lies to see if they believe me and then laugh about it to myself when they do.......heh...heh  anyway then we were talking about if we ever have kids we would never be able to go anywhere and do anything.Except amy...she has alll these sisters that would take her kid is she wanted to have a night out.So me and alisha deceded that amy should fill all of our biological urges and have some kids that we can play with and hang out with....and then go to our childless home!!! I mean, it would really be more for alisha, she has little to no contact with children on a daily basis. I guess I have the best of both worlds, I get to hang out with kids all day and then get to do my own thing the rest of the time!! that really is a sweet deal. If I could only make my ovaries see how great we got it, then I couild just stop having my period all together b/c it's not going to get my anywhere I want to go , if you know what I mean.  Wouldn't that be great if you just have a one-on-one with your ovaries "hey you can stop producing eggs for awhile I really don't want to reproduce" and they would be likr "no problem". And just like that it's all over...painless.  yeah..when I was a child I really thought there were little men inside my body running the whole operation. I would eat some food the first guy would send down my throat and then to the next stomach guy and he would do his thing and so on..they would all talk about me and you know, do there thing.I would actually picture this little factory in my body and when I would get sick I would thing it's b/c I did something to upset one of them.....I was a weird kid.

      So yeah alisha urlLink   fixed all the comments on my blog,apparently they were under her name or something stupid like that. But now they look super cool. BUT.....All the old comment were erased....Boo that. But she has them and read them to me.Which was nice.   Idecided I want o have a menial job when I grow up. Me and alisha were just talking about all the shit we do, and how at our age pple just don't do shit like that anymore...Going out drinking several times a week..Meeting strange magicians at bars..You know the usual. Anyway, I figure if I just have a job where I have no real responsibility then I can still do whatever the fuck I want...Right. I mean I would never have any  money and would really really hate my job. But I would have a lot of fun and I would never have to really grow up and be a serious adult. Being all grown-up seems really boring to me in soo many ways.Staying at home and the hightlight of your week is to rent a video....boo that I say..boo that!!!  The only other job I can think of where that would be ok is Rock Star!!! But I eman really....I don't think I have the talent to be a rock star. Unless I could become a famous bongo drum player...That I can do. Ok change of plans...I'm going to be a rock star!!! woohoo...livin-on-the-bus-drinking-beer-everyday-puking-out-the-window..here I come!!! Are you excited..cause I'm excited!!  oh yes spaghetti I got your messages........your so cool!!!

      so ahh I'm trying to write in this thing like everyday..but I must confess I'm really not clever or witty enough to write something good everyday.And it brings down my self esteem to reread them and see all the poor spelling.It makes me feel like I should go back to grade three , when I had to stay after class and write out vocabularary, yep. Every word I got wrong I had to write it out 100 times. you'd think I would be  a better speller as a result..but no. The spelling part of my brain seems to have blocked out that aparently horrid memory. Which is why I'm such a poor speller. Man who needs a shrink!!!!!!  All the answers to the univeres anre hidden in my brain and I have subconsciensly blocked them out...now we'll never know the secret to time travel.  If I could travel back in time I think I would hav taken this semester off and looked for myself somewhere. Who cares where....As long as it was constructive  man sometimes I think I'm getting stupider....

      so...I have neglected to do any work all semester and now I'm fucked. What am I going to do!!!! It's not even liek I could just sit home for days and make shit up b/c I need to have everything signed by my school supervisor. Now I have nothing signed and nothing done and it's coming to an end and I'm fucked. JUST FUCKED...and yet here I am writing in my blog when I should be doing work..  so, you know what really gets on my nerves...people who stand in the subway doors during rush hour. you know who you are! You stand in the doorway and refuse to move when people get on or off. I just want you to know that when running for the train and you think yuo can make it in the doors right before they shut...YOU are stopping me from doing so.That's right I'm talking to you, All you door lingerers. Get out of the fucking doorway man! I need to get on that train or I wouldn't be running!!!! just move in just a little bit for fuck sakes!!! I know you want to lounge there leaning on the door way all cool like you don't care about everyone...WELL I CARE ABOUT YOU!!!! just move in man, that'a all I'm asking...just move in for the love of god.  I obviously need to calm down..the train runs like what, every three minutes.   I like the word procrastinate....it's a theme with me lately....

SO my mom bought me this vegan cookbook for x-mas. which is nice. I was trying to look through it yesterday to find something to make. but like what the fuck!!! They want you to have all this crazy stuff.......like "and then use your electric yogurt maker..." ok..who has an electric yogurt maker?? And all the recipies call for protein powder!!! kinda gross if you ask me....  so yeah I have to go to school today. And yet again I will be showing up empty handed with no assisignment. I'll have to stay up all night t get it done.Then I'll be bitchy for days and days. Cause I know everybody loves that!  I love my mom.

The poem, which satirizes the Carmelite friars of Cambridge,  The whole thus reads in translation: “They are not in heaven because they fuck wives of Ely [a town near Cambridge].”

I want to date a boy that's like me. none of this metro-toocoolforschool-insensitive-trying to be sensitive crap. I want someone real...who will talk to me and tell me what the fuck is really going on. I'm not good at guessing shit like that. you know? or aybe not.  So if elvis was asian..and 5feet tall...and had grey hair....then I seen him on the subway. He was sitting across from me and I couldn't stop staring at him. I know it was mean...but dude he WAS elvis. it was more then freaky.   So  urlLink alisha  has kindly fixed up my blog for me, seeing I'm too stupid to do it for myself. So cudos to her!!! you know I love you pussy girl!!!

      I was on the subway and I had ths great idea for a blog entry but now that I sit here I totally forget what it was.well then...I guess this is it.  I went to McDonalds for lunch today, and ther was this guy there who was buying his dog a hamburger as a treat. His dog was waiting outside.That was all he ordered, I thought that was really cute. to take your dog for a walk and then buy him some lunch. it's kinda like your kid...or a bad date.  I really want pink hair......red is nice but pink..that's hot!!!  And pink would match my new tattoo.

      so I ride the subway like a million times a day. And It's like a second home to me now. I have seen some weird shit on the subway...and I've only lived here for two years. so anyway, today...I saw hitler. It reminded me of 'The Andy richter Show' do you remember that show? well if not then you missed out b/c it really was the funniest fucking show on t.v.....so anyway there was this one episode where andy's friend was dating twins but she didn't know it, and then andy was telling all their friends and they were like "andy is this like the time you thought hitler was the muffincart guy?" and then it flashed back to him running down the hall at the (hitler looking) muffin cart guy yelling " HHIIITTTLLLEEERRR NNNOOO!!!" and then andy was like " what you think when hitler comes back he's just going to march in wearing his uniform?" and then his friend was like "WHEN hitler comes back? and if hitler were alive today he would be like 124(or some ridulous age)" good times.....  yeah so I seen this guy on the subway and I thought of 'The Andy Richter Show' and what would happen If I ran over and tackled him. what the subway ppl would do....?  I really don't think they would do much more then stare. but that's me.  I got a tattoo in my ear. it's a pink star. and it's cute as helll. I'm in love with it.

      Yeah so it was my birthday yesterday. I realized that I'm no longer going to have birthdays. I just want to forget that the day I was born is significant in any way. I mean really. Nothing good ever comes out of my birthday, they are usually really sucks, I get older and rarely get cool stuff!! (except for alisha's cool 'book of ideas'). I mean my birthday is pointless. And for now on I'm just going to stay in bed on my birthday. I'm just sooo glad it's over and I can get on with the rest of my life, which by having a birthday, I realized is slowly coming to an end.  So besides that.......I really like ice cream. I don't just mean I LIKE it....I really really love it. I could eat ice cream in the middle of winter sitting in a snow storm. I just like it that much. I can never get enough ice cream.   I feel the same way about rice.  yeah....So, I just want to go to sleep since I didn't sleep last night, I stayed up to watch infomercial about weight loss, like that ever works. I sit in front of the T.V. thinking I deserve to be that skinny. But yet I have no motivation to actually lose weight.

      I hate to fly. not the flying part but al the other ppl who fly along with me. They always seem to want to talk to me. And I hate that. I always have to pretend that I'm asleep or really into my book.I know it seems bitchy but there i only so much smal talk you can make before you run out of things to say and it gets all awkward and weird and then you feel like you need to keep talking but neither person wants to. At the same time you don't want them to feel that your ignoring them but that's all you really want.   I mean who really finds true love on the airplane. And if you do is it really love??   you should not be able to recline your seats on the plane. B/c I already have like an inch of personal space.....and when the bitch in front of me reclines her seat her head is now in my personal space. Sitting for two hours on a plan looking at the top of someone else's head is not fun. I just want to say that right now. And to all the ppl who recline their seats with no thought of the person behind them........I hate you.  let's face it, I hate everybody who dosen't give my candy, or other edible goods.

      Well then..Hello there!!!! So spring has sprung...heh. I first want ed to address the complaints about my poor spelling. Did you not read the post about the really mean grade school teacher!!!!!! Well go back and read it !!!. I'm trying to be better..I am now able to use spell check ever since I got cable internet. It no longer keeps me from changing my template or using spellcheck!! woohoo to cable.  I don't really have anything funny or witty to say as usual (haha) I just felt that I have not posted in some time and I needed to do so. so here's my post..POST!!!! Post..Post...Post!!!  done..Thanks.

      I keep writing titles even thought I know they are not going to show up on my blog anyway!!! Silly grrl. So anyway I was searching around soulseek for new bands as I always do late at night with nothing else to do.. And I came across a very old band that I love.  the beatles!!! Man, I remember driving in the car with my dad, listening to the beatles singing along. It was one of those things where I just always knew the words. I don't ever remember trying to learn the words to "I wanna hold you hand", or "black bird", it's like this instinct that I just always knew the words to all the beatles songs. Music constantly keeps me in awe... how soo many people can write so many different songs...You'd think they would have all been done by now. And then a band like black eyes comes along and opens everything all up again. Is that really cheesy?? I think it may be a little cheesy.  music is just ....Music! It's just the way it is. People try to analysis it everyday and it never works out b/c it's just....Music. It speaks to some other part of your body...It just dose. It just never need explanation.......Like toes. You know they are there for a reason, without them you would fall over all the time. They somehow keep your balance. But you never think about why they are the way they are...Ugly. There just there...Your toes. Maybe that was a bad comparison......  I don't know..It's late and I'm tired. And I don't want to go to bed in case Amy comes by....Maybe I'll just sleep next to the door in case she buzzes up....*yawn* I can feel myself becoming nonsensical.....

      ok, the title has nothing to do with this post. I just really like to write the word fuck. I like the way it looks and the way it sounds when you read it out loud.  So as you all see I fixed my blog up really good. I got this template fro maystar designs(the link is at the bottom) I'm going to ask alisha how to change the colour, she told me it was just a numbers thing. Speaking of numbers...They area  really great band!!!"insomnia!insomnia!...."  So I thought I had a virus in my computer But then it went away..What dose that mean? My computer was all turning off and then turning on again... And It would do this all night unless I unplugged it. But then ..I awoke one day and it just stopped. I turn it on and it will stay on till I turn it off. And vice versa. I love it. I mean even though it's suppose to do that.  So anyway I havn't reallly done much in the past little while. I have mostly hung out with alisha and her new bo....who, I may add, I totally love! they are so fucking cute together it makes me sick! well not really I'm really happy for her but it makes me want to be with someone too!!! and as we all know you never get what you want when you want it, so I'm not looking forward to this game of looking for someone to date me. B/c for one:..boys never want to date me..and two: when a boy dose want to date me , I get all mean.. and do things to push him away until he leaves me alone. I don't know why, it's like this test ot see if he really likes me. yeha I know.. that's really fucked up and makes me seem crazy.and now we all know why I am alone. I say that I choose to be this way..and for awhile I really did chose to be this way. but it seems lately everyone has someone to be with and I gettnig left home more and more. Or becoming a third wheel.  Fuck you and your springtime coupleness(is that a word?)

      ok, so if you read alisha's blog you are aware hat we are thinking of  starting a band. All we need are instrumaents and a little bit of talent!!! no seriously. so here are some band names we have thought about: -filthy panties -honey slut -fresh panties -soyalicious -cuntalicious -pink panties -glamour cunt - CUNT/BITCH/SLUT/PANTIES/DOLL/PINK(ok...this one was kinda a joke) -president juice(kinda boy name though) - Chai fetus (ok we went for chai lattes and I was adding cream to mine and when I put the stick in to stir it there was this big giat thing in it...it was this enormous tea bag!!! and it looked kinda like a meatball or a chai fetus) -alisha's knees.  ok so those are just a few of the names we came up with. we were thinking filty panties b/c then we could be really poppy sounding but have really feministy and rauncchy lyrics...."let's wipe our cum on my parents bed"- Bikini kill.  anyway...what's your opinion???

      Ok, so... We got tickets to see the pixies!!! whoa. What the fuck ...the pixies, the band that is responsible for bands such as nirvana, weezer, etc.. Really the list is endless. And e are going to see them live!! It's not for like another seven months or something, but knowing I have tickets is good enough for me!!! So I bought an extra ticket. It'll go to the highest bidder!!! While we were in line the grrls I met there told me someone bought a ticket to the winnapegshow for 399US dollars!!! So I holding on to it to see what's going to happen. Maybe I'll sell it on eBay.....Maybe I'll have a raffle........ nah. I'm going to sell it on E-bay. Unless one of you wants to give me $399Us...Then the ticket is all yours!! haha just kidding. I doubt I'll get that much for it. But I only paid 45, so even if I get a hundred it'll be worth it.   So ok, ticketmaster thought it would be a good Idea to sell pixies tickets as well as Christina agularia tickets at the same time. So there was a line of about five pple...I kid you not.. And only one guy was the for CA tickets. They were giving out wrist bands to draw for the person who was going to get tickets first. So me and the other three ppl there to get pixies made a deal that if any of us got picked we would buy all the tickets. Makes sense right?(they did sel out in Winnipeg in less then two minutes) So I say to the guy... If you get picked do you mind if we go first b/c if we wait we might not get any tickets at all. And he was all like no, I want good seats to CA.....  ok...WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!!! Dude...You know your going to get tickets...No matter what! But if we wait we might not get tickets!! That is like pure selfish ness right there. Stupid christine agulaira fans!! but alas..Good wins over evil and he did not get picked!! So the fine ladies I met in line bought tickets on my behalf so me and two of my companions could enjoy the pixies. Thank heavens for nice grrls who love the pixies!!! THANK_YOU!!!!!  GIANTIC...GIGANTIC.....GIGANTIC...A BIG BIG LOVE!!!!

But the super cool thing is...I have "here comes your man" by the pixies , as my ring. And those of you who know me.. know that I ahev a special place in my heart for the pixies. I also downloaded "should I stay or should I go" and "tainted love" three very good god choices in my opinion.  So I will now be the grrl dancing whenever my cell phone rings..... do do doooo do do do do here comes you man do do do do dooooo dooo do.... woohoo

      Peopel who say sex dosen't change things is wrong. not that I hear many people say that...but you know. For a long time I had this dilusion that I could fool around with certain friends and not have it interfer with the friendship. It was really the ultimate dream, to have a friend that you completely loved as your friend and you did friend stuff, you joked around with each other, had you own seperate lives where you did whatever you wanted without answering to the other friend, and still have sex nad what not. but this dose not exsist. I have finally accepted that reality ...you just can't have it all. there is no way.Someone always gets weird. You can say "it's just sex" all you want but without good communication...all fails. Someone gets weird about the whole thing and the other person is left thinking...what the fuck just happened here? you lose a good friend and you lose sex. it's just not worth it!!  so the moral of this story is.....if your going to have casual sex..do it with someone you never want to see again, or someone you care very little about. Friends + sex = no good.

      And then I found  urlLink this  when looking up info about said item...   Dear Mrs. Mills,   I have worn a monocle on and off for the past few years. I now feel totally comfortable   and indeed confident with it. However, I am anxiouis to know the correct etiquette, if   any, that goes with the wearing of an eyepiece. I do entertain on a regular basis --  luncheons, dinners and so on -- and I'm desperate to ascertain the correct procedrues   when receiving dignitaries and, of course, female company.   DPC, Lincs   Dear DPC,   While the monocle should be worn whenever needed for seeing clearly (ie, reading,   shooting, neurosurgery), it is also your responsibility to maintain its silly-ass yet,   paradoxically, rakish image. So, for instance, it should be worn when eating soup so   that you can exclaim "Gosh" (or "Crikey" in extreme duress), put on a surprised   expression and allow the monocle to fall into the bowl -- a minor coup de théâtre that   will give you the moral high ground. On the other hand, when being introduced to a   lady wearing a low-cut dress, never fail to screw the monocle tightly into your eye   socket and draw! "Hellloooo" while examining her cleavage closely. Extra kudos is   obtained by sounding like Terry-Thomas.   Mrs. Mills

      So I went to the eye DR. Last week to get the perscription in my glasses updated. I have a severe stigmatism in one my eyes and when the Dr looked at it he was all " wow that's really bad" and then he started to tell me what was wrong with my eye. I have had the same problem all of my life..........but I think it made him feel good to tell me...so I let him. anyway.... later that day I went to go get contact lenses (my first pair in nine years!!!) and the guy told my my right eye was fine  and that I only need one contact lens. If I had my time back I would have got a monocle. Alisha was talking about monocles on her blog and me and alisha already had this conversation. But I could actually get a monocle!!! I only have bad sight in one eye. I am only going to need to wear ONE contact lens! Man, how cool would that be....When you want people tom know your really really serious..you just take of your monocle and tilt your head a little to the left.....Powerful!  and then I can go out and start solving mysteries!!! or become a strange butler of some kind!!!haveing a monocle calls for a whole new career!!! I could just sit around looking prestigious!  So when I go back to the DR. I'm going to inquire about getting a monocle......I'm curious to see if they still make them and how much they cost.....I'll let you know the skinny as soon as I find out..

      So I was on the subway (surprise) and the woman next to me fell asleep on me. Yes, you always think "that'll never happen to me" and then...it happens to you. What is the priopoer subway ediquitte in that situation? do you wake her up and be like "hey lady your drooling on me" ,give her a pillow?, subtly lean into her so her head falls on the person on the other side of her?... I really didn't know what to do..so I sat there until it was my stop and then just got off. I'm assuming she woke up and was like  where the hell am I? you know how it is.

      so I just got a new kitten!!! I was going to name him Mr. ridiculous...but I figured he'd get teased enough for having a pink coller with spikes(*wink), so I gave him a very many name instead...darwin. ok so it's not all that manly but sure is a nice name!!!! I love him soo much i could just ssssqqqqqquuueeezzzeeee him. But that's not really moral and I could get charged with abuse. imagine that, getting put in jail for loveing someone the wrong way. Well I guess if that way kilss or harms someone that your fucked upa dn shoudl be put in jail!!!  ok, enough of that.  bu seriously, darwin is the cutest cat ever made! there is only one thing about him I don't like...he's sooo needy!! he need my constant attention, if he's asleep and I leave the room he gets uo and follows me then goes to sleep whereeve it is that I am. I knwo it's cute. he walks right under my feet and I'm always kicking him by accident...it's really annoying, I always feel soo bad to see his little tiny body go flying across the floor and get right up only to walk between my feet the next time I take a step...and the cycle continuse.  anyway It's late ad I need some sleep ...don't you worry I haev soo many cat stories....

      So the saga of the crazy cat lady continues....  so, ok, we have this door that leads out onto the roof, and other people have windows onto the rook and the way it is our "neighbor" in the next building has been feeding stray cats out there window. So, all these cats and a door leading into our apartment only spells bad news. Our apartment smells like pee...Cat pee! So we complained to our landlord about this cat issue, and I guess he complained to the pple next door to us. He also took away all the food and cleaned up the place not to mention told these pple not to feed the cats out there.   but...  the next day this crazy guy comes out the window and threatened the life of my roommate!!! I kid you not...Over cats he doesn't even own!! I know, craziness, then when the food did not return he dumped cat litter by our door!!It's really fucking gross I'll tell you that much.  so I called the police, and now we wait........dum dum ddduuuummmm

      soooo. how's it goin???...I don't really have much to talk about but I haevn't writen in here in about a week and I think that's a little unfair.So I went to go see my friend luis's band play the other day. They were really good!! it was in his highschool...yes that's right I went back to high schoool...It was way different then I remenber highschool being. I'm not sure if it was b/c it was like, six years ago or b/c I went to high school in newfoundland....  but I got harrassed by  teachers and it was a pain in the ass. we were told that if we left we couldn't come back in and all this other shit. I was kinda irratated by the whole thing...I'm a 24 year old woman and if I want to go out for a smoke..then I should be allowed to do so. I understand the whole, pple with guns might try to break in here, but I'm a adult and I should be able to go out of a highschool and come back in....  and also most of the time when kids go into schools with guns...they already go to school there. they are already mad at the way they're being treated in school.....  but really they were treated these kids like they were all fucking morons..they didn't know any of the kids names and they were hearding them around like sheep...it was really awful, very disorganized and out of control in everyway...  man, I don't miss highschool in any way what sooo ever....

      So, Someone new has moved into our house. I don't know how he(orshe) got in but I would like him to pack his stuff and move out. Not that I'mn afraid of mice...but I don't want them crawling on me while I'm asleep. I gotta say he IS pretty cute.   So I called my friend chris last night to help with the whole mousey mouse situation and he was all like "why are you freaking out? What's the big deal?" and then he gave me some ideas on how to get rid of my mousey mouse friend,:1) get a bucket, make a ramp and put food on the ramp and trap it....this is a bad Idea b/c I saw the mousey mouse climb a wall..2) leave a trail of food to the door and leave the door open...this is a bad idea b/c I have some really fucking creepy neighbors and I do not want them in my apartment, or I don't want to let the mousey mouse in someone else's apartment.   I don't want to kill the mousey mouse. I just would like him to find a new place of residence. I want to catch him and set him free in the park or in the subway, mice seem to like the subway. OR, catch him, put him in a cage, feed him, love him, call him fabio and he'll be mine forever.........yeah, not so much the last one.   any ideas about catching my mousey mouse friend in a humaine way?     NO KILLING!!!!those traps scare the crap outta me...

      so. I'm having one of those months where I would just do anything to go to sleep before 5am, and then I have been forcing myself to stay in bed past 8:30. It's hell. I feel like  my body is all hopped up on something and I seem to have forgotten what it was!!! It's like if I get more then fours hours of sleep the night before then my body goes all nuts and is thinking...Well that's enough sleep for one week, don't you think?  NO I don't think!!! I just want to be able to go sleep like a normal person again. If there is such a thing as a normal person with normal sleeping patterns.  sleep,    If your out there and your reading this...I MISS YOU!!Please come back. I love you I really really do. I know I have taken you for granted in the past..but I promise I'll change!! I

      Hey there ho there........ so I went to he bar on Friday and when I went o grab my bag to pay..somefucker stole my fucking purse. So I assumed at first that it fell off the back of my chair so I was asking all the people around me if they seen it, if it was under their table or whatever..but then this chick stood up and described my purse and told me that she seen someone walk out with it. Why you wouldn't you say..."hey that guy may have stolen your purse", is beyond me. so later that night the bar called my house and was like we were cleaning up and we found your purse..WooHoo. but they did take my wallet. so I figure the grrl who stood up and was all, I seen that guy take your bag..Well she took my bag. What a bitch!!!  Lucky for me my wallet was all she fucking took, my cell and shit were all still in there!! I was freaking out..I filed a police report and all that other pain in the ass stuff. Only to call back and cancel it. I felt like a moron.   yeah so that was my weekend...  and a cute boy kissed me..It doesn't get any better then that.I found my bag and I was kissed!!!!! THE MAGIC EIGHT BALL SAID IT WAS TO BE SO, and as we all know ..the eight ball is never ever wrong.

I think we woke amy up today...there was a little screaminess going on..and I felt bad about that..  oh yeah...I hate the bank. what's so wrong about keeping all my monety in a mattress anyway?? I lost my client card so I went to get a new one and the woman was a fucking moron about it. When I went to use it to buy something it didn't work. so I figure no big deal I'll go back to the bank. Well not so easy, as the bank hardly ever is, she had canceled my card all together!! why on earth would she do that!!! now I have noooo....money..  see!! the bank is stupid, and I'm stupid for using it!!  that's it...I'm getting a steel mattress with a lock.

My cat is driving me INSANE.......He dose this thing now where he wakes me up in the morning by licking my face until it's all raw and hurty.......It hurts me, but he just so cute!! I love him ..Yet...Have a extreme dislike for him as well.   OMG, we went to go see the  urlLink The white cowbells they were fucking crazy, the music was great but they put on this fucked up show!! They had a stripper ( featured on the blog) and the guy played guitar with his penis!!! Yes, there is a picture of that as well...It was soo fucked up, he had this glass rod over it and he played the guitar with his penis!! fucked up I know! They even sawed up giant stuffed animals with a chain saw....Craziness all over the place. I will defiantly go see them again...It was really great!!

      so, me and alisha got the ball rolling on some sing-a-long fun last night. We actually sang a song and recorded it!!ok, that may not seem like a big deal to you, but believe me...it's the farthest we've ever come to getting this band thing going. What suprises me is that I think we are really going to do it!!!! So we've thought to name our band  The Doll Incident .Alisha came up with it after I told her a traumatic story of my childhood.....but I don't want to talk about that.   So I woke up this morning to my cat licking my entire face,it was cute at first then it really started to hurt a little bit and then I think he was trying to lick my skin off!aawwweee trying to lick my skin offff...how sweet. He's like a really cute little demon cat. he constantly scratches up my legs when I'm sleeping, so I can no longer wear shorts, or open snadels. he also has my neck and chest all torn up. so, basically, I'm all blody and gross.......ok, that may be exaggerated a little bit.  I do love him though...I can't imagine what it was like before.....

"Left unchecked, this progression can result in debt, sexual crimes, perversions and other harmful effects" "Masturbation conditions our bodies to respond to self-stimulation, which is self-centered." "Masturbation poses the threat of lifelong bondage and a handicapped spiritual walk.  Jesus was resurrected so that you also could live in a new life, free from the slavery of sin." "Masturbation causes you to be "mastered" by sin"  I, on the other hand think masterbating is normal and I encourage you to do so. but that is my unprofessional opinion. but then again that whole article is some other persons unprofessional opinion.  wouldn't it be cool if masterbating was a profession......well porn I guess...but I mean they hired you to sit in an ofice and masterbate all day then write a report about you felt about that.....  good times, good times

      I went to go seee the new harry potter movie tonight. It was ok, not as great as the first two, mostly because the effects were all the same. And really with a movie like that it's why you go!! or maybe you just like the harry series...who am I to judge you on what you like....hm?  so I went with my friend luis. He, seriously, is one of the coolest guys I know. we're sitting in the theatre and luis looks over at me and was like "hey stacey, check that out" and he kinda nods to his right ....... low and behold I see these two bare feet jutting out from behind the seat. can you imagine feeling so comfortable in the theatre to take off your shoes and socks and just put your feet up!!!. I just felt bad for the guy sitting next to those two feet.....eewwwee!!! your all watching the movie and you look beside you to see two smelly feet right next to your head.....yeah I would have to move cause there is no way I'm going to enjoy the movie after that!!!  someppl have no clue about what's disgusting!!

       At the Aching-Heart Diner    She'll flavor her coffee with both cream and sugar and tap on the window as she mentions the weather, tossing off sparks when she pulls off her sweater. The waiter will come. She'll give her order bluntly: "A hot chicken sandwich and a tall glass of water." She'll spatter her french fries in grand doses of vinegar and the point she is making, emphasize with a gesture, her steak knife held high like a gravy-stained scimitar. And the salt that is scattered when she topples the shaker she'll toss with a flourish across her left shoulder. I'd like, I will say, to get to know you better. I'll look down at my clubhouse, so we don't look at each other as I pull out the toothpick that holds it together.    this is a poem by david o'heara. I read it on the subway today as I haev many days. I don't know I just like the way it flows......

      ever have one of those days where you feel like your in the way of eveyone you know?  I've kinda felt like that for the past few weeks. I don't know why, I love my friends and I know they love me........  hmmm....Alisha come back from her travels afar!! she brought me back this tin box and it says 'box to make you pretty' in french, and it this picture of three little girls and the one in the middle is pulling the hair of the other two...it's really cute. I put all my misellanious make-up in it today....now it's all full of  "my face" (that's what I call putting on my make-up,putting on my face).  my cat was alone most of the weekend, I cam back to check on him everyday but he was alone most of the time. Anyway now that I'm home I don't think he has left my side for two seconds. he was waiting by the door for me when I come home....awwwweee. what a little cutie!!  when becca baby come back with her digital camera I'll take some serious pictures of the little cutie pie and post them all up for the whole world to see......I'm going to be one of those crazy fucking cat people...with all the cat figurines and t-shirts with pictures of them holding their cats on it...  you know who you are....  "this is my cat scampy...isn't he the cutest thing you've ever seen. I made us matching outfits to wear to the movies" and I would have to talk in that really high baby voice that hurts your ears a little bit...

      so I went to go see  urlLink super size me   saturday night. wow!! They guy ate  39 lbs. of sugar!!  that is the grossest fucking thing I haev ever seen. I gotta tell you, when he threw up out the window of his car I ewas done with fast food for ever. no, really. But ....I think the portions in the states are way bigger then they are in Canada. But you know, it's not like the US to do things in excess!!!C'mon, who the fuck needs half a gallon of soda and a LB. of fries.  Sweet Jesus!!!  gluttony at it's best.  So I've had this copy of  urlLink Fast Food Nation  for what feels like forever and keep telling myself that I'm going to readt it but yet never manage to start. I gotta tell ya', I'm going to read it now for sure!!!  OMG, and then I was telling this guy at work about SSM and he told me this story about his mom's B/F. This guy is a plumber, so, his company gets a call from McD's to come and fix their coke machine. So he takes the top off to look inside, you'll never guess what came out.....are you ready for this...no, really.......ok....thousands of  MAGGOTS .  No, I'm not kidding you. I'm not even sure how that would've happened, maybe a fly got stuck in there and layed eggs?? ok, so now think about all the coke that was poured and drank before the plumber came to fix the pipes.God only knows how long it was like that.   now, what do you think about that?

      when I was in elementry school CC was my forever-best-friend. She lived doen the street fomr me and I spent&nbsp;almost every weekend of my youth at her house playing dress up with her sister cloths. We would put on these fashion shows for her parents. Her dad would give us&nbsp;funny names and sing silly songs about us. He was always saying or doing silly&nbsp;things to make us laugh. He gave me a valuable lesson in humour, one I carried with me to adulthood.  It's ok to be ridiculous. It not only makes you feel good but it makes other people feel good too.  My mom called me early sunday morning to tell me that CC's dad had died of a massive heart attack. He was&nbsp;young, it was&nbsp;so sudden. I never realized how much he affected my life until that moment. That seems to be just the way it is I guess.   I'll miss him very&nbsp;much. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      What I want&nbsp; is to stop hearing that stupid song on the radio...I also want to get this new apartment that I want. And I would like some to tell my cat to stop peeing on my bed. yes that will be all for right now.   so what is it some cat thing where they are like "spray me with the water bottle will yah...well I'll show you with my incredibly rank cat pee who's the boss up in here!!"   and then he pee's where I like to sleep....In my bed!!!!! Can you say I don't wanna sleep I now wanna vomit!!   cat peee is like the worst smell imaginable. I Know, I can now smell it all the time. well, I got this recipe of like peroxide and baking soda and hand soap that I sprayed on it to make the smell go away...And it worked for the most part. It's still there really faintly but you have to actually stick my mattress up your nose to smell it. Which is not sooo bad, cause it doesn't really fit up my petite nose anyhow.   I had this dream last night that my evil ex faked his death to get back at me. It was really weird. He was shot by a gang.and then I found his body wrapped in newspaper. Then when I went to school the next day he was there and I was mad b/c him and his g/f had planned it all out to make me feel bad.   it was fucked up. Maybe my dislike for him is all coming back to me in sleep. That's too bad.

I seen THE funnest movie tonight.  urlLink http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/napoleon_dynamite.html &nbsp; Napolean Dynamite is the funnest movie I have seen in such a long fucking time. I laughed from the time the movie opened right up until the closing credits. It was soooo good...there was clapping at the end..I kid you not. People in the audience clapped. I know you always feel like doing it but nobody ever dose....well people did. and I gotta tell it...this movie really deserved it!!   it's about the guy we all knew in hight school who is so obviously weird but the only person who dosen't know it is him, because he just dosen't care!!!   "do these chickens have large talons?"

      I've seen super size me, and now I have read fast food nation. Both were valuable pieces of information ....  so why then do I still feel the need to eat at mcdonalds???? is it the cheap food.....no.  is it the great taste................NO!!  I don't know why I eat there, I know that they feed dead chickens to the meat, along with animal litter. I know that a great deal of the meat we consume contains fecal matter which could cause e.coli, and that could lead to death. I know they market high fat, high calorie, low nutrition food to our children.They pay there workers considerably low wages,&nbsp;cheat their workers an are STRONGLY against unions.  yet when I walk into a McDonalds, I don't see any of those things. It's like the place I know all these awful things about is somebody else's McDonalds. It couldn't be mine...I eat here all the time!! all those years of fast food couldn't be that bad for me...could they?? could all the things that happened to morgan spurlock really happen to me, Stacey Janes??  I know your thinking......what is your point. well I'm not going to eat fast food every meal for a month that's for fucking sure. but I think starting today, I'm gonna boycott fast food for real this time. it's really really gross. and I think I have to come to realization that what's happening to fast food in the states is happening here too. and that the McDonalds down the street from my house is part of that large corperation that supports and encourages near slave labour in the meatpacking industry. I need to start thinking that Ray kroc lives down the street from me at my McDonalds .  today.......day 1.  &nbsp;

It's sooo crazy mean ....Yet entertaining....hmm.  &nbsp;  so we decided that the girl who won, at the end when they told her it was a hoax but then gave her a recording contract anyway....Well....They didn't actually tell her it was a hoax, they kinda said it all vague like and that was MEAN!!! I mean C'mon do you not think she's gonna figure it out when she see's the show and gets humiliated all over again?? It was soo awful, they convinced this poor girl she was gonna&nbsp;be a star...but yet she's never going anywhere b/c they LIED ...and she's actually the worst singer in america! &nbsp;  but man, these people were really awful. And it was THE worst show I have ever seen on TV. The worse part was once we started watching we just couldn't stop!!! It was like a really gross wound that you can't stop yourself from touching, or the weirdly ugly guy on the bus that you can't stop staring at...&nbsp; &nbsp;  you know what I'm talking about!!!!!! Don't try to act like your above all that...Cause I know your not!!!!!!

      So we went out friday night and got our drink on. i was good times. we talked to some people and what not....you know the usual good times to be had goning drinking on a friday night downtown.   but I gotta say the highlight of the night was the ride home on the street car!!  we go to sit in the back and there is this guy back there all by himself...he's like "you can't sit over there there's a boi-hazard on the seat"   it was a BLOODY SOCK!!!! it was this tube sock cover in blood strewn across the seat. he was like "I went to tell the street car driver and she's gonna wait till she gets in the yard and call the cops". so we all sat back there with him to help protect people from the bloody sock on the seat. People were getting mad b/c chris was like "dude you can sit back there it's a bio-hazard...you don't know how many people's blood was on that sock!!!"  the driver kept anouncing "please be aware there is a bio-hazard on the back of the car"  the saddest part of that whole thing (besides the person who bled all over the sock and what happened to them) was that we know if we hadn't of refrained people from going back there....someone would have just moved the sock and sat down.   that's gross.

      so I'm a nanny right. and I take my ladies to a near by park and until today I thought this woman pushing a carrage was just a homeless women. but no! she actually thinks the bag full of stuff in her cart is a baby. I heard her talking to it today, asking it if it seen my babies and weren't the cute! she always sleeps in the park with a blanket over the stroller, I thought it as so noone would steal her stuff....bt no, it's too not wake the he plastic bag...  a old man stopped me today and asked me if the ladies were mine and when I said no, he was liek "I thought so, your wayyyy too young to have two babaies like that" what if they were mine.....he would have openly judged my "youngness". that's just wrong. I'm 24 I could totally have two kids under the age of two and be married and all that other adult shit. I mean realy, my mom did it!

      my mom told me today (via e-mail) that sje wants me to go to therapy....like a real shrink type deal!!  dose that mean I'm fucked up, or is that the whole point of going to therapy, for them to tell you fucked up and then try to fix it?  I don't think I'm gonna go though...I have enough going on in my little brian without some so-call-doctor filling it up with stuff. I know full well why I'm fucked up without somebody telling me why they think I'm all fucked up!  I'm a big girl who can over analyze things all on her own!
