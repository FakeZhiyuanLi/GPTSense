      Ahhh- yes they day after Thanksgiving. And nothing says Thanksgiving then putting back a mag of Pino! In my glory days I could do this in style. It was a wonderful thing. Now that my youth has passed there are many side effects that come after the drinks are gone. 1. Light headedness. I feel like I am floating which is cool but makes driving a bit hard. 2. Sleepy. Drunk sleep is never good sleep. It is like you have never gone to bed at all. 3. Smelly. I am sure that I do not really smell. Actually I am sure about it. There is some guilt that comes along with showing up at work hung over that makes me think everyone around me can smell the mag of wine seeping from my pores.  Ahhhh- yes Thanksgiving. I would not have it any other way!! Cheers.

      I can not wait for the holiday's to be over. Pack up the fiberoptic Chritmas tree and take down the reindeer sock from our walls. Ahh-  I was anti-Christmas ths year. But if you could see my house you would see that I was over rules with my elf like roomies.  Here are some examples: 1. Pine garland. I am not sure where is camp from because last I check pine does not grow in a rope!! I think it was dead before we hung it from our railing because mostly we track the needles around the house with our feet.  2. The riendeer on the wall. Okay this was a joke. Well I thought. A family joke of one on my delightful roomies. This thing is made from a sock but if you ask me, or as a matter of fact any of us who live there it is a bit suggestive of something very inappropriate. You have to see it to get it. 3. My favorite is our Christmas Cards. I would say that between the four of us who live in the house five of these cards are from a friend or family member. The other 100 cards have come from plumbing suply companies, tile places, lawyers, bankers. Who are these people?!?! Slightly pathetic I think!! Plus they are getting all bendy from being inn the window for a month. What would make me happy is to take this all down and return to the clean non-lighted confines of my living room.

      Snow Days are fun!! Here are the reasons why I love snow days! 1. You never have to get out of your Pj's! 2. The couch is much more cozy on snow days. 3. It is okay to eat all the food in the house because it is a snow day! That is how I spent most of mey weekend. Lounging around eating eggplant parm and watching the Family Ties marithon. Could you ask for anything more?

      I have no problem cleaning the bathroom....But it is my theory that I should be excempt from cleaning the seat of the toilet. Why you ask becase I do not pee all over the seat. I am pretty sure that this is a task for the male members of my household. Think about it this problem is worse then leaving up the toilet seat. It's seems to me that they leave the seat up as a hint......

      I sit down at 6:00 PM to watch Law and Order and then do not get up until 12:00 AM when the show is finally over. Is there something wrong with this?

      DO YOU HAVE OCD LIKE ME?!?! Sometimes I think I have OCD. I actually think that we all have it in our own little ways.  1. I check the alarm clock about ten times before I go to sleep. 	There are so many things that can go wrong 	with an alarm clock. Batteries can go dead, 	you can forget to switch it on, is it on AM?, is it 	on PM...God it stresses me out. 2. Did I unplug that fire starting devise? 	Weather it if the curling iron, toaster over stove I 	always think that I left it on and the house is 	all a-blaze as I drive happily to work jamming to 	the radio. It has gotten to the point where I call 	home and make people check these things 	out. These are the two major ones. What has "sparked my paranoia this time are the dam planter ash trays that live on my front walk. The other night I walked past one and noticed it was smoldering. It was not like someone had tossed a cig and it was burning out. No the dirt in the pot was red and smoke was billowing around it.  The one time when you need a fire-fighter they are out of the house. Luckily Chuck was there and saved the day with a full glass of water. He has a little bit of fireman power in him too. Now every time I walk to the door I have to look into the planters and see if we are starting a forest fire.

      This is what it like to say good night at my house...... M: Do you smell the boiler backfiring? L: Yeah but you get used to it after a while. M: I wonder if we are getting poisoned by carbon-monoxide? L: Oh my god do you think we should check?!?!?!! M: Nah! Sleep well.........

      Sunday night I am packing up my cosmo making kit and bringing it up to Chuck's to watch the very last Sex in the City ever. It is a sad day for us girls who learned a stronger love for shoes and fancy pink drinks from watching the show.  I can hardly wait to watch the show, but the anticipation leaves so many questions. Will Carrie and Big get back together? Will Samantha and Smith do anything crazy? Will Charlotte get pregnant? Will Miranda and Steve live happily ever after in Brooklyn?.....The biggest question is what the hell am I going to watch next Sunday?!?!?!?

      I am happy to report that the town came today to remove the massive glacier that was forming in front of my driveway. Little did they know that this was my ploy to get teenage boys stranded in front of my house!!

      THERE ARE NO PIRATES IN NEWPORT This weekend was a lovely touristy adventures. Long drives along Newport's Cliff Walk, walks up and down Thames Street and wondering in the grounds of old mansions. A fear of turning into my parents was somehow made okay, because it was the most relaxing getaway I have had in a while. It was actually so pleasant that I did not have to tell anyone to "shove it". (Sorry Kara!!) This maybe because I turned into one of those people who we shoved it to last year.

      To speak to strangers or to leave them in the snow?!?!?! This is the question. Last night as pulled down the street where I live I noticed that somebody had driven off the road and was stuck in what we like to call an ice-bank*. I decided since I was right in front of my house that I would see if there was anything I could do to help. You see all those hours of seeing unsuspecting girls stop to help someone and get kidnapped on Lifetime has slipped my mind at this point. The boy was very quick to tell me he was not speeding and that he had only had his license for a month!! Two things pop into my mind at this point.  1. You sir were most definitely speeding. 2. Are you running way from home?** What became even more stunning to me is that this boy had no idea where he was. We did try to move the car but then he wanted to run up the road to see if he recognized any of the houses. Finally he came back with a friends father who was able to pull him to safety. I watch this from my house instead of being outside and part of the action for the following reasons. 1. The boy asked me if I lived there with my parents. (God do I look that young?) 2. The friends father thought I was the boys date and asked me if I wanted to go wait in his house were it was warm. (Again!! How young do I look?) 3. My house was warm and Ginny and I got to see all the action from our windows which at that point were comparable to a fish tank. (and I was insulted by the two prior reasons). So the moral of this story is to leave them in the snow unless you are feeling like becoming a 17 year old girl whose boyfriend is a very bad driver!! *ice-bank: (n) was once a snow bank, but thanks in part to our lovely New England weather and the amount of time that piece of snow has been compacted my a snow plow. **My parents would have NEVER allowed me to drive at 10:00 PM on a school night, in the winter to my friends house.

      Last year this time a group of girls entered NYC. The were armed with only great shoes, a change of clothes and the catch phrase "You can SHOVE it!!!  This year I am going to Newport. Armed with great shoes, a change of close and my boyfriend.  This year I will teach Chuck the catch phrase and maybe we can shout it at a few helpless waiters and maybe the cars informat of us. This year I will give the phrase new meaning but will still miss my girl power.

      As a young college student you could often hear me boasting about my drinking abilities to anyone who was paying attention to me. This often time lead to me having to prove that by doing a disgusting amount of shots or slugging down a box of vino. This was something I was very proud of.  After college the drinking slowed down. I became to tiered and fascinated by my couch after a long week of work. I finally came to the realization that I was to old to party like a rock star anymore!  My rock star days were over and I was okay with this. My friends tease me all the time with comments like..."Laura plans on how to get out of activities a week before it happens." and "You are so freakin old". I was okay with there comments because I like to go t the gym and the grocery store on a Friday night. Then come home and watch my TV boyfriend Bosco on Third Watch. This weekend things had changed. The pressure was on as my dear boyfriend took off for Alcholbany. I decided if he could party like a rock star all weekend I was not going to be out done. (This was a momentary flashback of my youth, it happens once in a while). So off I went with to friends to DRINKADELPHIA!!! The weekend started off by taking the train into Center City. We found an old Irish pub that claimed to be the oldest pub in Drinakadelphia. Here is where the action began. We guzzled down a pitcher each and caught up on the latest gossip.  After the novelty of the oldest pub in Drinkadelphia wore off we headed to the next place. Unfortunately being three girls with unhealthy shoe buying habits we got distracted by the shinny window displays and had to do a little drunk shopping. One of my cohorts had been warned by her fiancé not to bring home any more shoes. Too make sure that this would not happen we priced everything in beer. M: Do you like these fancy shoes? L: Yeah they are great but for $40.00 that is like eight beers!! M: Your right lets go to the bar! We then stumbled over to the next Irish pub. This one was a little more lively than the first. They had big screen TV's and there were tons of people drinking and watching basketball and having a grand time. A few beers later I had insulted the waiter and made a new friend who gave us cigars. He claimed that he brought them from Cuba but upon further inspection it turns out they were from the Dominican Republic. I think we were doopped. Donald Trump would have fired us for being so slow to catch on to this mans trick. So by the end of the second game we were ready to rock. We headed home to put on our dancing shoes and head out for some more drinking. At this point we headed for a local bar that was famous for it's giant beer towers and the most delicious French fries I have ever eaten. (If you are ever in the Drinkadelphia area stop by Chickie and Pete's for their Crab fries, they are to die for).  By the time our first pitcher of beer arrived at our table we new we were fading fast. The hours of drinking and shopping had worn us out and the beer was only making our eyelids want to shut. What were we to do. At this point we were party for seven hour!! Most people would say that we were rock stars. That drinking for that amount of time and still being able to get into our dancing shoes was great. But we knew that the only way we could conceder ourselves to be in the old rock star status would to be to stay out until they kicked us out at closing time. It was decided that it was not the fact that we were getting older and had not drank that much since the late 90's that was making us more sleepy it was the beer! We must make the switch to booze. Real rock stars would drink the hard stuff anyway and we WERE real rock stars. The switch was easy I grabbed my usual g&t and we headed of to a few more bars. It was like the old days talking to strangers, there was dancing and singing (well we were the only ones dancing and singing) there was also the traditional drunken walk home, cat calls and all. If I worked for the tourism board I would tell people go to DRINKADELPHIA when you are feeling old and want to have an evening that makes you feel like you are in college again.

      STATIC CLING Well we finally have a nice day here in New England. It is to warm for a coat, but by the time I leave work the weather will have soured and turned cold again. Boo Hoo- Instead of grabbing my big wooly winter coat I thought it would be nice to just grab a sweater incase I was chilly.  Coming back from a potty break I noticed that something had fallen out of my sweater onto the floor next to my desk. Upon closer inspection I noticed that it was a pair of panties! My panties! I guess it is not worth it to be stingy with the fabric softener.

      ONE MAN BAND ON A BICYCLE The gym was empty last night. Usually it is full of skinny girls and muscle men lifting very heavy objects. They typically use the gym as a meat market, where the very skinny girls can meet big muscle men and later bread the super human baby. Last night it was just me and one other man. Which was nice. I did not have to worry that anyone was going to try and speak to me while I was huffing and puffing. So I happily began my work out. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed the man on the bike next to me was flailing around. Which forced me to look and see if he was okay!! It just so happen that he was so inspired by all the peddling and what ever tunes he had in his walk man he had started is own air band. Man he was into it. First it was some dramatic air guitar. Whooo!! He was good. I felt like cheering and dancing. Then he busted into this great air drums solo which lasted for about five minutes. Dam he was the best drummer I have ever heard! All this while peddling on a bike. It was a crazy musical experience. After I had finished my workout I felt like I have been to a crazy rock concert. Yeah AIR ROCK!! YEAH!!  I had to bite my lip to try and not laugh. It made my trip to the gym wonderful and I can't wait to go see who will be playing there tonight!

      I have funny quirks about the food I will put in my mouth. For those of you who live with me you know I can not eat a bowl or cereal with anyone else in the room. People think I am crazy and strange because of this. The thing is I know it's not true. One of my friends gets grossed out when she looks at chicken and has to toss it instead of eat it. Recently, in my co-habitation I have come to discover that I am not strange or crazy. I am just more open about my food phobias than most! Recently, a friend told me about Soup at Hand. My first thought is "ewwww- soup can just drink out of a can."  The thought of this was not making me hungry, I could only imagine what creepy crawly thing were at the bottom of the can.   Then stuck with no lunch and a growling belly I was forced to eat one. I did not think about the fact I had no idea what was put in this I just began chugging soup. It turns out it is the most wonderful thing I have ever had in my life!! It is a meal that takes 1 minute and 15 seconds and fills the grumbling belly. You should go out and try one today. May I suggest New England Clam Chowder, or Cream of Broccoli. The old lady in the grocery store said the tomato was the best so I got one of those too!

      Running out of gas is a painful thing. I am the type of person who never has gas in their car. I hate pumping gas. Once the car is going it's and nice and warm I hate the idea of having to get out when the wind is blowing 40 MPH and it's negative 40 degrees outside! On Saturday while driving home from NYC it finally happened. I ran out of gas. I had some how convinced myself that this would never happen. That my car was superior to all other cars and would always have enough gas to get me home even after the warning light had come on.  It took an hour and a half for AAA to come and save me. During this time I found twenty lost hair bands and I book I had started reading months ago that had gotten swallowed by the mess in the back seat of my car. The first half and hour was like an adventure but after that my companion and I got very board and fell into silence. Finally our savior AAA-man arrived with $3.00 worth of gas. Due to the gas prices here in the northeast it worked out to be a little more than a gallon. Sadly this left me forced to get gas. One might think that I would fill up the tank and become a frantic gas pumper. Toping off every time I passed a gas station. Having learned this lesson I pulled up to the pump and only filled it half way. Come on its cold out there!

      This weekend my friend Mary was visiting from Germany. Mary was always the type of girl who could talk her way out of trouble. For instance one time in college she spilled her beer all over some drunk chick. She then managed to convince the girl that even though she poured beer on the girl purposely that they should be friends because they have the same name. Or the time when we were at a bar and they would not give us shots so she took the bottle from behind the bar. She was then caught giving shots to girls in the bathroom by the owners daughter, who happened to be powdering her nose at the same time. Mary then had to make a quick escape and upon leaving the bathroom was able to convince the bouncer that the owners daughter was a bitch and it was her fault that Mary stole the bottle. Free as a bird she left the bar. This weekend we found ourselves in Atlantic City. As we walk along the board walk Mary decides she loves the ocean and would like to climb up the construction crane that is located on the beach. It all happened very fast. And after a while we could not see her anymore. She seemed to vanish into the coast. Finally we can hear her calling us to come to the top of the crane and look at the ocean! Yikes. Her yelling seems to attract the construction crew. Who come outside to remove the drunk girl from their machine. This is the point where I think the cops are coming because I have forgotten about all of our misadventures before. By the time I make my way over to her (it took me longer because stilettos and sand are a bad combo) Mary has convinced one of the workers that he should give her a tour of the beach when he gets off and gives him my cell number and off she goes out in the clear!!! Lucky her! My only question is when will the beach guy stop calling my phone!

      Laundry Day Surprise My friend was doing some of her boyfriends laundry the other day. As she emptied the basket she found a piece of paper that had been torn out of a magazine. She glanced at the paper filled with shinny engagement rings. Taken back by what she had just found she turned the paper over. On the other side there were buy one get one coupons for his favorite restaurant. So instead of getting something shiny and new she gets one free entree with the purchase of one for equal or lesser value.

      TAG SALE!! Tag sales are strange things. You are invited to someone's house to judge and pick at their things. When you get there all the junk they have had stored up for years and years is sprawled out and priced. Now I went tag sailing with a specific purpose in mind. I needed couches, a coffee table and two end tables. I did not find any of these items. What I did find was an entire list of questions.  1. What makes you think your junk is worth so much? Example: We found a nice coffee table. It was slightly used. Had a few dings and scratches. It's just what we happened to be looking for. We could easily spend $15.00 on that table. Upon asking the man what he was charging he put is pinky by his mouth and said...$100.00!! Are you kidding me! YOU don't even want it. I could go to Bob's Discount furniture and get a NEW table for the price!  2. Now you have asked the price now what? Example: There was no way we were spending $100.00 on this scratch and dent table. But we 	were in someone else home surrounded by their old things. Things that held memories for this family. What we wanted to do was laugh and make Austin Powers imitations. "Mah-ha-ha $100.00". What we do instead is look at the table for a few minutes. Look at each other, look at the table...touch the table. Each of waiting for the other to speak. Finally someone says 'let's think about it". And we run to the car, and replay the Austin Power moment the entire way to the next tag sale.  3. Sign? what sign? Example: What I don't really understand is that you have placed an add in the paper stating that you are having a tag sale and what it stops there? The ad reads Danbury by the mall. Okay so we find a sign in that area pointing left. We head left and then nothing, it's the only sign, there is nothing else for miles. The road twists and turns and there are no more signs. Don't you want people to come to your house?  4. Why do I feel like I am walking into a trap? Example: We pull up to this house and it is silent. You can not hear anything no people, no cars, no barking dogs, strange. Then we 	see a sign "Come to the basement". Now I am inclined to believe that most people are not crazy ax murders but, hey can you count on that always? I get an eerie feeling that "Come to the basement can have mixed message. Come to the basement so I can kill you. Come to the basement so I can tie you up as sell to a factory where they will make you de-shell walnuts. How about you hang a sign up that says "TAG SALE IN BACK". Jeez would you teach your children to head to the basement of a strangers house? Unfortunately I still need furniture and quick. I have thirty girls coming to my house this weekend and they need a place to put down there cosmos!!! So off I go Saturday morning to try try again.

      I have started a new book. Here is a taste:  1. Grab the nearest book.  2. Open the book to page 23.  3. Find the fifth sentence.  4. Post the text to your blog.  "Back in the sixties, when block busting was a popular activity for liberals, one of the State Street homeowners sold out to a black family, and over the course of the next five years the entire white population panicked and left."  I am currently reading One for the Money by: Janet Evanovich

      Last night we went furniture shopping at a furniture outlet. Usually when the fireman and I go looking for things for the house, we have to prepare ourselves for war. I am a big fan of plan and simple, and Fireman likes things that belong in a castle in Rome!! So when we entered the store and both like the same furniture we decided to buy it without even looking at anything else. We decided that we would drive the couch and loveseat home that night, because it was a two hour road trip excursion that we did not want to make again. As they opened the loading dock it started to rain. No not rain...down pour. It could not have rained any harder!! Now it was raining when we left and we are pros at moving so we had a tarp. As the trap was unrolled there was something strange about it. It was not the giant tarp that we had bought for occasions like these. It was only three feet wide. Midget tarp?!?! Oh no!! We struggled to cover our new seats with this narrow plastic and it was clear to me, Fireman, and the furniture salesman that there was no way that this was going to work. Do we give up and do the right thing? Tell the salesman that we will come back for the stuff? NO!! Of course not we are taking this furniture home tonight even if there is a plague of locusts!!! At this point the salesman has come up with an idea!! He tells us that out baby tarp is not going to work. If we go over to the Christmas Tree Shop they will have much larger tarps that will cover our couches so we can drive home safely!! Great idea furniture man!! So Fireman and I load up into the car a little damp but not too wet and head over to the Christmas Tree Shop to get our tarp. As we walk into the store we realize that this was a bad idea for many reasons. One I get distracted by all the shinny new bargains in the store, and two, what made us think that a store whose inventory changes daily would have what we were looking for?!?!?! After our first trip thru the isles we did not find a giant tarp. The closest we found was a plastic rain poncho. After debating we decided that would not work! Feeling frustrated we decide to split up and look for shower curtain liners. Hey they work in the shower and they keep the bathroom dry. This should work for us too!! Well I was not able to find the liners but I had found something better!! Plastic Table Cloths. These were your typical picnic wear. Red and white checked, "it made me want a hot dog real bad". The fireman and I decided they would work and patted ourselves on the back as we danced our way to the check out!! As we stretched the table cloths over the couches it was clear that all this was doing was making the truck look like a chuck wagon. All I needed was a bell to call the cowboys over for dinner. CHOW TIME BOYS! Now soaking wet and staring at the chuck wagon we realized that we were doomed to have wet soggy couches. As we stood around dripping trying to figure out what to do we saw an orange oasis in the distance. HOME DEPOT!! Racing down the highway and sitting at several of the worlds longest red lights, we finally reached the orange beauty. Fireman and I proceeded to buy the biggest and heaviest tarp there ever was, and headed home. Another crisis solved in the Mclillo household!! Couches can be moved in a typhoon.

      The boyfriend was a t a rest stop in Waterbury today. As he cleaned up his car a state trooper pulled up next to him. The state trooper was very interested in his new car. He asked the boyfriend how fast the car went. THe boyfriend expaline that the car went pretty fast. I mean do you really want to tell the trooper that the car can go as fast a cheeta and still handles like a dream. The trooper then commented that he would like to see how fast the car went.  Now was this a trick? IS this the newest speed trap. My responce to the officer would have been. Sorry sir I only drive the speed limit.

      I have started a new book. Here is a taste:  1. Grab the nearest book.  2. Open the book to page 23.  3. Find the fifth sentence.  4. Post the text to your blog.  "The pier workers are milling about, the barkers, the sideshow acts, the animal trainers, some men from the fishery."  I am currently reading The Five People You Meet In Heaven by: Mitch Albom

      This weekend my friends came from far and near to walk on my team at the MS walk. This was an amazing effort, my team raised $3400.00!! This money will go for new programs and research for MS! What amazed me the most is that I have these great friends who were willing to walk 8 miles, get lost in the woods, and do it with a smile even on a  few hours sleep at 7:30 am on a Sunday morning. You are my greatest support system and I thank you for being there for me!

      For my birthday I got an MP3 player. On which I downloaded my favorite songs and went off to the gym. I love my little yellow MP3 player but there are some warnings that should come along with it. 1. Earphone pads act like a sweat band. They get all soggy and wet and sweat starts running down the wire. I am often afraid of electrocution, or at least a really bad burn from the battery. 2. They make me want to sing. I will be running along and have the urge to bust out a few lines. I have to physically put my hand over my mouth to stop the noise from coming out. 3. My lips move!! I find myself trotting along, sweating on the wires and I will be lip singing the words to the song. I am afraid that the air guitar guy from a few weeks ago will ask me to join his band!

      As a commuter I see some interesting things as I drive to and from work each morning. Not the usual stuff like people eating breakfast, while talking on the cell phone, putting on make-up while talking on the cell phone or even the usual people reading the news paper while talking on the cell phone. It is more of what is on the outside if the car that makes me laugh. For instance today I was behind a big dump truck. The back of his truck was a friendly reminder of which side he should be passed on. The left side of his truck states "SAFE WAY". The right side if his truck reminds you that passing on the right would be "SUICIDE". We all passed him on the right anyway. Get out of the left lane trucker!! I am sure that by pulling onto the wrong side of the road to pass on the "SAFE WAY" would have not been so safe on route 34.  The  next interesting thing I saw on the outside of a truck this morning was a pick-up truck. The windows were tinted dark so you could not see inside. On the back window there were two skeletons. It was the back of them, so it appeared that the boy skeleton had it's arm around the girl skeleton and the girl was leaning into him. Young skeletal love. Who knew that they make x-ray tint for windows. I have to get me some of that. My all time favorite thing that I saw this morning was a plumbing van. The van had a bumper sticker with the companies motto printed on it. Why is this a strange thing? Fireman's plumbing motto is "I'm a plumber, I'm Italian, and I'm from Yonkers". So plumbers do have motto's. The truck I was behind this morning stated "We Make Shit Flow".  For all the commuters out there I request that people keep on writing on the backs of their cars and trucks. It breaks up the hours we sit behind that plain old empty bumper of the car in front of us.

      Today is my birthday. I thought because it was a special occasion I would let myself by lunch instead of bring it to work. Well to tell the truth, I have not been grocery shopping in weeks and I was a little weirded out by the caned chili sitting in my pantry. Because I am a big snacker I grabbed some of The Fireman's goldfish. (sorry fireman). They were the snack pack kind, and my usual snack of fruit cups and low fat pudding have been out of stock for a while now. Thoughtlessly I tossed them in my purse. People wit children do this all the time. On the was out the door carelessly fling a child size snack in their bags so the troops do not get restless on the way to grandma's house. You can imagine my surprise when I stopped to get gas when I went for my wallet and instead came back out with a handful of crunched up goldfish!!  By the way I am going to eat them anyway!

      Bank holidays are always good! You get a reprieve from work with a nice long weekend. Also, and more importantly people are always having parties, that start in the early afternoon and then end when people are passed out in the yard. Last Memorial Day weekend the Fireman had a spider bite on his arm. In my drunken stupor I convinced him to go to the hospital to have it looked at and also, that it was a good idea that I go into the examining room with him.  Yeah, that emergency room reeked like gin and tonic. Gotta love it. I have no idea why they let me in there. All I can remember is Fireman telling me to stop talking because I was going to get the doctor drunk!! What adventures will happen this year. The Neighbors have just moved into their new pad and to celebrate they went out to the packie and bought a large amount of booze. MMM-booze. This might work. I can walk to The Neighbors house. Rock!  What might be very interesting is that they live in a condo complex that fines you for being loud, using the wrong dumpster, or you know, running over someone dog. Ooops- I am proposing that we start a pool on how many fines will be issued. To get in the bet you have to pitch in a few bucks. The winner will take half and the rest will go to pay the fines. Or buy that lady a new dog. Whatever!!  I am guessing that we might be close to $100.00 in fines by Sunday morning.  Don't get me wrong, I don't want The Neighbors to get fine. We like playing at their house, but with 40 people and a shit load of booze it is bound to be a party. Things could get interesting here. Will this long weekend live up to other long weekend? You bet your ass it will.

      When South Beach Diet goes to your head it turns out that you can come up with some very interesting pick-up lines. At the movie theater the Boyfriend walked around to the candy counter. The girl behind the counter asks if she can help him. The Boyfriend responds; "No, I was Just admiring your candy."

      Sha-na-na I'm A Rock Star This weekend we celebrated the Fireman's birthday at the lovely Mohegan Sun Casino. Where I became a rock star lounge singer for one night.  After our usual pre-gaming we headed to the casino in a stretch limo. Once we got there we hit the usual bar and a few slot machines. Feeling a little toasty a few of us decided that we would skulk around.  We ended up in a little bar with live music called Lucky's. After getting our drinks we headed down sit near the band. The Fireman was feeling good and decided that I, The Singing Luba, should definitely sing with the band. Fireman yells out "Let Her Sing". To my surprise the lead singer came over to the table to see what the commotion was. In a world wind Fireman and the singer had decide that I would be the first one up when they went back on for the next set. Oh my God! Now I will sing the karaoke until the cows come home but there are no words on a screen here! What the hell was Fireman thinking? Now I have to go on stage and sing with the band in front of all these people?!?!?! Then we hear..."we are going to bring up a special guest singer". It was me! What were my choices? Should I run? No! I got on the stage and in true rock star fashion tried to rock the house. I loved it! I was a rock star, lounge singer on the Fireman's birthday. Sha-na-na!

      Urban legend or not I will never lick another envelope. I over-heard a conversation at lunch about a cockroach. As it turns out cockroaches like the dark confines of cardboard boxes. For instance a box of envelopes. (cringe) This particular cockroach, who we will call Mommy Cockroach, made her lovely home in a box of envelopes. Mommy Cockroach crawled around the box, crawled in and out of the envelopes, and finally found a nice sticky place to lay her eggs. (gag) Here is the sick part... One day the owner of the box of envelopes needs to mail a letter to her grandmother. She unsuspectingly grabbed the envelope, put the letter to grandma in and licked it closed. She never had a glimmering thought that by committing the innocent act of licking the envelope that she had just fertilized her mouth with Mommy Cockroache's BABIES!!! (barf, barf) The innocent letter sender would not even notice that this had happened until the baby cockroaches started to form in her mouth!! (cringe, gag, barf, barf) I have no idea if this is true or even possible but I do know that I will be closing my envelopes from now on with a sponge or I will at least hand them off to whom ever is sitting next to me.

      Last night I had a dream that I was getting dressed in front of an open window. Outside my window was a pick-up truck with a man in it. He kept looking in the window and when I looked at him he would look away. Finally when I realized what was happening I screamed and everyone in the house came running in to see what had happened. It was not just the people who lived in my house but friends and family were there too. I told them all about the man who had been looking in my window. Then the man appeared in the room that I was in and explained that he was not looking at me he was looking into a big box he had. When he opened the box to show me what was inside I thought it was baby skunks and this was scary. The man told me to look closer and in the box were baby koala bears and little baby monkeys.  After discovering these fun baby animals we all got to play with them. The were little and I was a bit afraid of them but in the end everyone had a great time. I wish that I had a dream book to figure this one out. I think that I am going to eat dinner a little earlier from now on. No more turkey burgers before bed. It gives ma crazy dreams.

      Recently I have been dieting. Getting ready for a big vacation in August. While looking for some inspiration I stumble across this quote on the net... "And if you CAN'T find a good incentive, then maybe you don't really WANT to be slim. Maybe you'd rather eat cookies. In which case, stop worrying about dieting and find happiness elsewhere." Now that is one smart ass diet website if I ever saw one!

      Happy Cinco de Mayo!!  A few years ago my amigo's and I would be plotting where to park our cars at the local Mexican restaurant right about now. We would stock the trunk of one car with some beers, incase the line at the bar was to long and head off to be the first people in the parking lot. This was never a pleasant experience. The bar would be jammed packed with people. The crowd so thick it was like moving thru quick sand to try and get to the bar or to locate friends who had been camped out at a table for hours. You might think that a table is a great place to be. Wrong!! The bar is so packed that being the lowest point in the room is very dangerous. Hands dangling around your hair with lit cigarettes, watches poised to gouge your eyes out. Maybe you are better off outside. On the way to the patio bar you decide that you have to go to the bathroom. After waiting in a line of fifty girls for half an hour finally you make it to the ladies room. Uggg- There is no toilet paper, the water has been turned off and the toilets are so clogged it makes you gag. After waiting and the line and finally reaching the cest pool you say fuck it and just pee outside. After all there is no line and oddly enough you think it might be cleaner. Ahh- the bladder has been emptied and you are off to locate your friends on the patio. It is a little less crowded here and you spot them easily, only to be stopped by a bouncer looking for your ID. Then you are stopped by a waiter looking for your ID, oh and don't forget being stopped by a cop and guess what he wants to see your ID too. Now that that is over you have to relocate your friends again. Oh no! here comes that bouncer again. Run! Run away!! When you finally reach your friends you are handed your first beer of the night. It has only taken an hour and a half to get to this point. As you place the cool frosty beer to your mouth, (wait who am I kidding, the beer at this place are never cold) you hear a scuffle. Cinco de Mayo is never complete with out a fight.  Shirts are being ripped off and tempers are flaring as everyone gathers round to watch. Five state troopers fly into the parking lot, seven town cops come in behind them and that is it the party is over. The cops close the bar and send everyone home. Two hours have past and you have not even sipped your now warm beer. Happy Cinco de Mayo, now lets go home.

      It is 1:00 am and we have been working on the house for hours. The fumes of paint and polyurethane have gone to our heads. The high from the fumes does not make either Bunny or myself question the Fireman when he tells us to "touch up" spots that have been painted several times. Note to self.....always breath in the fumes before working with the fireman. It is much more peaceful that way!!

      Welcome back to the work week. Last night at about eight I started to get those Sunday night blue. That sad feeling you get when you start to realize that play time has come to an end and now it is back to singing the company song for five more days. The Boyfriend and I sat watching Dead Zone weighing the options of taking a mental health day or heading off to work. And work won out, we are very reasonable people. Ugg- Why put off the inevitable? Right?  ********************* On another note, to get you loyal readers to use the comments field that I have so cleverly added I am going to start posing questions to you on day to day issues that plague us everyday and see what you have to say. This weeks question is....Is it okay to pop your zits on the mirror in your office?

      During the demolition process of remodeling we were surprised to find bees nest in the ceiling of our basement. These were no ordinary nests, they were huge! About three feet long and luckily empty. There were nests the entire length of the basement and garage. Yuck.  When the boyfriend discovered these nest we vowed that we would get an exterminator and have him spray like mad so we did not have to share our commune with these winged, stinging creatures. Time moved on and the vow to get an exterminator was ruined because no bug man will spray the outside of our house in it's current condition. Being in the midst of construction there is to much destruction outside to spray. This was a fine excuse until this morning when I made the discovery. I had just finished eating breakfast and was contemplating doing the dishes when I heard it, a banging on the sliding door. I when I went to see if a bird had flown into the window, it was then that I saw the first one. A big fat Winnie the Pooh bumble bee. I thought nothing of it at this point and opened the slider to let him out. No big deal these guys sometimes fly in while we fly out and I was the only one left at home so he had plenty of opportunity to get in. I went into the bathroom to start getting ready for a big day at wok. When I reemerged into the hallway I heard it the distinctive sound of buzzing. BZZZZZZZ's bouncing of the cathedral ceiling and window. BZZZZZZZZZZ's echoing in my ear. This was gross, gross, gross. There were at least five more bumbley bees hanging around. Now I did the only thing that made sense ran outside and I called The Fireman to tell him that there was an absurd amount of bee's enjoying the big screen in the living room. He told me to stop panicking and he would spray tonight. As I walked back into the house I noticed the again these little shits had doubled. Well this time The Fireman was wrong. It was time to panic!! I ran into my room and got dressed as fast as I could. I grabbed my lunch and headed off to work forty-five minutes early, with the sounds of bee's bouncing off class echoing in my head. Ugggg- I think I need to call The Fireman and warn him this problem might be bigger than the both of us. I would hate to come home and find him with a body suit made of bees. Yuck!

      My urlLink  sister  just sent me this e-mail and I had to share it all with you dear friends: Are you tired of all those sissy "friendship" poems that always sound good, but never come close to reality? Well, here is a series of promises that really speak to true friendship:  1. When you are sad - I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you sad.  2. When you are blue - I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.  3. When you smile - I will know you've finally had sex.  4. When you are scared - I will rag on you about it every chance I get.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. When you are worried - I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to quit whining.  6. When you are confused - I will use little words.  7. When you are sick - Stay the hell away from me until you are well again, I don't want whatever you have.  8. When you fall - I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

      Lately as I am driving I have noticed that people seem to be losing their shoes all over the place.&nbsp; There are perfectly good sandals on the side of the road on my way to work, nice shiny Nike's on the side of the road on my way home from the Beach. This leads me to the question of the week...How do people lose their shoes on the side of the road?

      This weekend we had a gathering of all forty of the people who are going on the cruise in 19 days. Since the boyfriend and I only knew a few of the people we will be traveling with we went with the intention to introduce ourselves to our new dinking buddies.  This was your usual picnic; food, music, swimming beer. It was like any picnic you would attend at my house. That is if the party was in the driveway and if someone had been shooting bottle rockets out of their asses. There was one thing this party had that mine have never had. An egg toss.  I was excited about the egg toss and like a good girlfriend asked The Boyfriend to be my partner. He kind of looked at me like I was crazy so instead I asked my father to be my partner. Sorry Boyfriend you lose! As it turned out this crowd was not letting anyone out of the competition. So it looked like The Boyfriend would be forced to toss the egg anyway. Who would his partner be??? He was then paired up with my MOTHER!!!  Something should have gone off in his head that said, "danger, danger, danger" but that button must have been broken on Saturday. The first toss went off with out a hitch for everyone, except the mom and the boyfriend. My mother dropped the first egg onto the pavement. Our hostess felt bad and gave them another egg so they could still play.  We all took a step back as the rules of egg toss state. We all stopped to let the mom Boyfriend combo toss their egg. The Boyfriend tossed the egg over to my mother and it said thou the are and landed hitting her directly in the head. I am not sure what happened after this for I was laughing so hard I nearly peed my pants in the middle of the street.  I know that my mother was the one with the yolk dripping down her face but the poor Boyfriend was the one who really had yolk on his face because he will never be able to live that down as long a she lives. Thank god someone had a video camera because we are going to have to replay that at every family function from now until we are all old and wrinkly.

      I rushed home from work today because The Boyfriend told me he had&nbsp; a great&nbsp;story for me and he wanted to tell me face to face. My first thought was that the story was about his ass launching bottle rocket friend who is always good for a laugh.  The Boyfriend's day started off with phone call from a distraught women who could not fit her adapter into the cigarette lighter in her fancy new car. Being the loyal Toyota employee that The Boyfriend is he told the lady if she stopped by he would show her how to put the adapter in the lighter.  When she arrived at the shop she had the wire with her. The went to the car where the strong Boyfriend pushed the stubborn adapter into the socket.  The women was very thankful but wanted to make sure it worked before she let The Boyfriend go back to his duties. This of course was no problem so The Boyfriend turned the car on and the lady grabbed what appeared to be a large bag. The bag contained a large box type devise. The Boyfriend being a man had no idea what this was. So the lady shared this tidbit with him, "I am so glad this works, it's my breast pump!'

      When I heard about  urlLink this  on the news today I thought it was a joke. Now I am just grossed out. I am still a firm believer that strangers should keep their hands to themselves. I would like a tee-shirt preferably one that has Rule # 7 on it. "NO DRY HUMPING"

      Saturday night The Fireman, The Boyfriend and I traipsed over to  urlLink Nif's  for a few cocktails on the veranda. It was late before we were able to pry our butts off the couch and by the time we arrived there it was completely dark.  About half an hour into our meeting we smelled skunk. This is nothing rare, we live in the county and there are always people running poor woodland creatures down on the road so we continued our carousing without another thought. A few moments later Nif's dog, Bear, started growling. We all began to berate the dog for making so much noise. Luckily The Fireman looked over his shoulder at the precise time a fuzzy skunk was approaching us. When we realized what happened we bolted in the house. Well Nif and I bolted in the house while the brave men-folk stayed around to scare off the vile beast. By the time the skunk vanished it was time to go home. Someone need to remind me to buy Bear a treat because as it turns out he is not good for nothing, he did save the day. ########################################### He is this weeks question of the week. This is to get you loyal readers to use the GD comments that I have installed for your commenting pleasure. What might posses someone to light a bottle rocket out of their bum?

      One of the few things I needed for the  urlLink cruise  was a new bathing suit. I have been waiting to get one hoping that the  urlLink South Beach Diet  would magically turn me into a size two over night. The mother kept telling me if I waited too long I would have nothing to chose from. And she was definetly right...AGAIN!! My first stop was at Marshal's. I thought I would find a bargan and be able to by myself a new pair of sandals to go with my new white dress. WRONG! There was nothing left. Just a few random eye patches and random thong bottoms. Being well indowed in the breast department I knew right off the the eye patches were not for me. As for the thong bottoms...Let's just say I have a little respect for the people around me and will be keeping my ass covered all summer long. Call me crazy. I was however, able to locate one bathing suit that was the right size and desided to be brave and try it on. The bottoms of the suit went on with out a hitch. I was getting realy excited becasue I loved this bathing suit. As I put on the top I noticed it was a litle tight, actually it was cutting off the circulation to my head. I was at this point struggling to get the bathingsuit off with no luck. Not knowig what to do I thought about asking the boy at the counter for a shoe horn or see if he could give a tug on the top. It might of made his day a little brighter. Luckily before I had to resort to this the top poped off. I think it may have made a sucking noise are it seperated from my flesh. Next stop was  urlLink Burlington Coat Factory . And yes they are "more than just coats". Don't laught Burlington is one of my favoite places when I am looking for something cheap and new to wear on a night out or when I am sad and broke and need a new pair of shoes to lift my spirits. Upon entering the store I found the bathing suits right away...all three of them and unless I aged fifty years I was not going to be seen in public in any of these granny suits. So I guess when the advetise that the are "more than just coats" it means that "they are more than just coats but not bathing suits". I turned and left discusted not even bothering to look at the shoes, because after all I was on a budget and I new what I had to do and it was not going to be cheap. THE MALL. Okay so I entered the mall and headed strait through Macy's. I stummbled across there suit department to find a gaggle of preteens looking at the eye patch section. I wanted to tell these girls that there was no way my mother would have ever let me out of the house in that and the should march right up to the third floor and by a repectable bathingsuite from the childrens department, you know somethig with  urlLink Barbie  on it. Finally I got to the one place I have never had any trouble finding overpriced swim wear Lord and Taylor. The greedily grabed every tankini in my size and headed off to the fittng room. At this point I was feeling no pain and did not need to pshyc myself up to try them on. The first suit I tried on I bought. I do feel that I should appologize to whom ever has to put that stuff away. SORRY! So I am the proud new owner of a pink and black poc-a-dot tankini, and I love it.

      Yesterday I went out with  urlLink Nif . This was not one of our usual trips involving cosmos and hot shoes. This outing involved bare feet and a lot of twisting. Okay, wipe those smirks off your faces, it is not what you were hoping it was.  We decided to try out a  urlLink yoga class . This might be my new most favorite activity. It was the most strenuous yet relaxing workout I have ever had. It took al the strain and annoyance of everyday life and banished it for and hour and a half. I hope that this is something I can work into my weekly routine. In other news exactly one month from today I will be sailing on the marvelous  urlLink Carnival Triumph  with my family and The Boyfriend for a seven day cruise holiday. I wonder if they will have yoga on the ship?

      Nobody will ever say that I have boring parties. This Fourth of July has proven that point without a doubt. The day started out like any other. Cleaning, cooking preparing for the friends to arrive. In true redneck style we set the part up in the driveway fire pit included. Thing started as soon as the keg was tapped. People were drinking and mulling around catching up with friends and then The Boyfriend pulled out the bottle rockets, as if to state "let the madness begin". BIT OF MADNESS NUMBER ONE Please do not point fireworks towards a crowd of people!! The Fireman thought it might be an interesting thing to shoot a bottle rocket in the direction that the non firework people were sitting. He must have forgotten that the yard is full of rocks. That crazy bottle rocket shot strait out hitting a rock on the ground, bouncing off the rock and burnt someone on the leg and then landed and exploded right behind poor little me. My ears are still ringing. BIT OF MADNESS NUMBER TWO Just because you saw it on  urlLink Jack Ass  does not mean that you should do it in my front yard. Dumbass had obviously never seen the beginning of the show, where they warn people to "Not try this at home" because the next thing I know his pants were down and there were bottle rockets sticking out of his ass. Lucky for him one of his friend was right near by with a lighter and more than happy to light it for him. BAM bottle rockets flying from his bum. It smelled really bad like hair. When I get my hands on the video I will post it for all you loyal readers to view it is a sight to behold. This is right at the point where Mama Luba made a new rule. No more fireworks until it was dark. MADNESS NUMBER THREE Being a good neighbor is something I will no long try out. As darkness fell the boys were itching to light more stuff in fire. The fire pit in the driveway was already lit and it did not make nearly enough noise so I gave the go ahead to light some more stuff off as long as they kept the fireworks away from Dumbasses, well, ass. As they began the war of the fireworks with the peeps across the street a figure appeared in the driveway. He explained to me that he lived up the street and wanted to watch the fireworks with us. Okay neighbor come on into our patio party. I am very neighborly when I am a little bit tipsy. They stranger who appeared normal at first began to speak to people at the party. This was the point when everyone there started to wonder where this guy came from and what the hell was wrong with him!! Here are a few bits that were worth while. Tid Bit Number One Stranger: I have schizophrenia but I am on medication. Luba: Oh.....  Tid Bit Number To Luba: I work in Shelton Stranger: Oh I bought a car in Shelton. Drove it to Georgia, went into a crack house, smoked crack, when I came out they had stolen my car. Luba: Oh... Sorry to ah hear that...umm- Tid Bit Number Three Stranger: Hey are you a cop? State Trooper (in uniform): Yes.  Strange: I got put in jail for 23 months. State Trooper: I had nothing to do with that. Tid Bit Four Stranger: I came here on the underground rail road, with Tubbs. Group: You mean Harriet Tubman Stranger: Yeah Tubbs, you know she's my friend.  Holy Crap I am changing my running route immediately. I am changing it to my parents house across town!  This way Fourth of July party never to be forgotten by all that attended.

       urlLink     either leave your answers or a link to your webpage with your responses.   Would you rather:  be covered head to toe with 500 mosquito bites  OR  find a leech attached to your genitals?  be blind for a month  OR  paralyzed for two weeks?  have a skin condition that forces you to wear a wool sweater year-round  OR  wool underwear?  only be able to speak in rhyme  OR  only be able to speak in haiku?

      Lately going to the movies has been very disappointing. Especially after I figured out that my TV has  urlLink HBO On Demand . Why am I going to pay $9.00 to go see a crappy movie when I can watch them in the comfort of my own home, in my ratty old pajamas?!?!? A few weeks ago I went to see  urlLink Anchorman . The small theater we went to was crowded with pimple faced teenagers making a lot of noise. By the time the movie was at the halfway point most of the teens had glazed looks over their faces. I was looking for something sharp to stick in my eardrums. Anchorman was the longest, most horrible movie ever. EVER. At the end I was very upset that I had given my hard earned money to the little man with the funny hat in the ticket window. Dam him he gets me every time. At this point I thought well at least with On Demand I can turn off the movies that make me want to pull my eardrums out. There is no need to get sucked into a movie that lowers your IQ, with On Demand you can just switch to another. What was that Tom Green movie? You know the one. It made me want to find every child who watched it, tie them down and make them practice their multiplication tables. Last night a group of us headed to the movies again. Suckered back in. There is something about that sticky floor that makes me want more. I think it's because it reminds me of a bar without the booze. I must admit that in the beginning I was wishing that I was home in my PJ's being comforted by the music of Law and Order coming from my TV. But from the opening credits of this movie I was sucked in and became a believer in the movies again. The movie is  urlLink De Lovely . Now I am not a movie person like may of my friends are. I can not quote a movie, most times I can not even tell you who was in a movie but this movie was great! The story was of Cole Porter who wrote songs for many musicals back in the 40's. The movie had a love story that was twisted as far as modern day values are concerned. By the end of the movie I as I was wiping tears off my face I thought "this is a great love story". Somehow it got me hooked, completely sucked in. It might have been the music or the dancing. It had cameo appearances from people like Robbie Williams, Cheryl Crow, Natalie Cole. God I need the soundtrack. De Lovely has made me a believer in movies again. Maybe I was born in the wrong era. I definitely belong in the time where all movies were musicals. I can even quote the majority of those. I often find my self wishing that my life were a musical and everything we said was in song and dance.
