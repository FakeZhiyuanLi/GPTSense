       Wearing: Hoody, Trigga Happy tee, cor-duh-roy pants, vans Listening too: The Dropkick Murphys Thinking: homicidal thoughts...   Well, Jenny's not at school today.....Im keeping my grip, everything is going to be just fi---FUCK SHIT!! CRAP! Thats totally not cool, I...I slept in and almost missed the bus. So, I ran. I ran my ass off across Anderson, it's like a mile or two...but still, I was running at 6:30 in the cold, raining, foggy, fucking morning. AND IM A SMOKER!! I cant breathe for shit after I run for a mile straight. I ran for her, she's not there. I came here, to hell, a school she describes oh so very well  urlLink  on her blog , and honestly I almost stayed home today. But I remembered her and how yesterday at her house was pretty fun and I wanted to be here for her to help her endure this hell-hole and hear what she thought of my story (in person, her words effect me better in person), and all that cute mushy gushy stuff. But she's at home...Im sorta okay with it though. I mean, yeah she's a junior; junior year is the suckiest. But...I mean...FUCK! I don't know, as long as she's happy Im fine with it, I just want her happy. Jen, stay home if your having trouble with your contacts, you can't see, your sick and sick and tired of school. I know we all are but...at least you have a chance to stay home, Im not being sarcastic...just stay home. Take your chance and stay home.

I got Chris sick, but I know he enjoyed every moment of it ; )  Everything hurts and sucks and tommorrow I have to go get a check up for more bc which I'm not sure what that will mean. Probably more painful probing of the vagina. Well, I have to go make fun of a magazine

       Wearing: Relient K tee, my black lucky pants, cons Listening to: Mr. Reech Thinking: Im so sick and cold...IM DIEING!   Well, thanksgiving break is over and it wasn't all that great at my house. The best part was staying the night at Jen's house on saturday. Oh man. It was great. Jenny got me sick, but that's okay, I was getting sick before I went to her house and we...cough cough. Um...Corey came down and he seems worse than when he left. He's really pale, thin, and very depressing. He sounded okay on the phone, then he got here and everything went to shit. Ofcourse he was pampered by my parents and anything that I would get yelled at for, Corey was excused for. I hate it, I hate my family's way of...enforcing rules. Well, Im going to quit bitching...later

Um, in english I have this huge assignment that's going to take me forever and they're only going to give me a week to do it. I have to write three 500 word essays about the Pains of Procrasstination, read an entire book, Tuesdays With Morrie, and come up with a presentation about A Clockwork Orange. It's gonna suck. Well, I don't know what else to bitch about. Bye kids.

       Wearing: Hoody, Tooth and Nail Records tee, dickies, checkered vans Listening too: My heartbeat echo through my ears... Thinking: Today is a good day   Today is Jen and I's 6-month anniversary. Yay! It's great. All though I feel like crap cause I can't buy her jack-shit cause Im poor and don't have a job. I mean, I have no money!!! Nothing, nothing, and nothing. NOTHING! All you guys out there, considerate guys, know how much it sucks to not be able to provide for the woman you love. It burns, it's almost draining. You feel pathetic, weak, insecure, unable to give her what she deserves. It sucks. It's the one feeling, the one emotion, I would kill to not have. It hurts too much to want to keep. I mean yeah, some people don't like being angry, but if you don't get angry about certaint things, you'd appear inconsiderate and soul-less. Well, all I feel is weak. Im just happy I can make her smile, comfortable, scream *wink wink*, laugh, giggle, cry out of joy. Everything. There's no one else I'd celebrate a six month anniversay with, there's no one else I've  ever  celebrated one with.

Im not too fond of the colors I chose for the Post Titles...I wrote crimson and it came out pink...I don't know, I'll fix it. Well, yesterday after school I whent to Jen's, had some awesome roast beef layered on top of white rice, mmmmm. Um, other than that I have nothing else to talk about...I'm kinda boreing today. Sorry.

       Wearing: hoody, plaid shirt, trigun tee, gray dickies Listening too: Mr Reech talk, again Thinking: Where is Jen?   Hey everybody, I spent a long weekend at my friend's house, Jordan. He's a funny guy. Um, the weekend mostly consisted of us playing games, driving around a bit, and me trieing to talk to Jen on the phone or trieing to find a way to spend time with her cause her friend decided to ditch her on the weekend. Jen stayed home alllll weekend, and I was fifteen miles away so I couldn't just get up and walk to her house. I felt really bad because...well....that's not fair, I should be able to spend time with my friends. But I feel bad cause she was ditched and couldn't do anything if she wanted too. I felt bad cause she was starting to get depressed. I feel bad cause she's not here! DAMMIT! Where are you?! I'm bored and I miss you, your smile, touch, everything. Im going to go now before these people start hateing my emo-ness. Bye kids.

       Wearing:Weezer band tee, dickies, cons Listening too: My fingers typeing away Thinking: Today is a good day!   I JUST GOT A 80.7% ON MY CISCO FINAL!!! YES! I'm so freaking excited. I barely even studied. It's so nice, like all day it's been so happily-weird. If that makes any sense. I was walking to the bus stop, running is more like it, and running late and I stopped to walk and smoke. Guess what, I broke the filter off when I tried to flick the ashes off. I ignored it and lit another one, which wouldn't light right away --the lighter was being a bitch-- and ended up lighting the wrong end. It's like I wasn't supposed to smoke this morning, cause instead of lighting up I jogged the rest of the way to the bus stop, which I barely made in time. If I had smoked this morning I would've missed the bus by atleast five minutes...and Jen wouldn't have been able to pick me up. Then I get to school and ace (100 freaking percent, baby) my Hardware Final in Cisco, then I take the written final in Cisco and get an 80.7%. Maybe I should take it again and do better. I don't know, someone up there is looking out for me...

Um, Jen's not here today? Im guessing her ride forgot to pick her up. Hell knows no wrath than the fury of a vengeful woman. Jenny's going to be angry. I read her  urlLink blog  and she seems upset. Well, I got the truANT cd by AAF, Glow is the best song on there next to Drifting Apart and 1000 Days...and Quiet. OK, well, there's a lot of good songs and Im going to make Jen listen to Glow. Mr Reech seems angsty so Im going to go now. Bye kids.

Yeah, yeah, I woke up to watching Sadam getting his head checked for lice! THEY GOT THAT LICEY-BEARD ASSHOLE!! And the reason why this is good news to someone as un-patriotic as me is cause Im in the Army and now, I, don't have to go to Iraq...or, I have a smaller chance of going. That's great news...today is a gooooood day. Bye kids.

       Wearing: Relient K band tee, gym pants(nylon) Listening too: Jen do the dishes Thinking: Im tired, frustrated, and very close to depression...   Well, lets see...what have you all missed. Christmas Eve was blissful, I bombed Jen with the big question, she said yes, I cried...yeah, I know, I'm a little bitch; remember, my nickname is emo. I whent to grandparents on christmas where my cousin and I played paintball...I shot him in the thigh, then he got my left calf, and then he ran out of gas. Kinda ruined all the fun. Then, yesterday, I sorta ran away from home. Im 18 though, it's legal. I was just getting tired of my family's b-s and decided to take a few days off, so Im at Jen's right now. I'd do some explaining but I don't wanna, not in the mood. Now that I'm thinking about it all, I think I want a cigarette.  P.S. Rob, can you check on my koc? You're the only one who could possibly know what Im talking about. Account names are Coll_Blackfeather (muff139), and xxTyler_Strifexx (muff139). Just get the stuff for 167,000 and look at people on my log who seem easy to steal from.

      Chris doesn't have a computer at home and since he hasn't updated for a while and I'm really bored I figured I'd just take the liberties of lettin' ya'll know that Chris and I are now engaged.  He propsed to me on Christmas Eve and it was really sweet so of course  he is not just my boyfriend now, he is my fiance and soon to be husband. I'll let him type out all the details and feelings and stuff when he gets to a computer. I don't want to ruin the news for him completely...Jen

Um, my brother is going through some major problems. This is my blog so I guess I can tell you; it's not like you know who he or I am. He tried to commite suicide so they put him in a ward. Jenny's great grandmother is dieing of cancer at age 94, I don't think she'll make it past next week, or this weekend at that. I gotta go, they're getting phone calls and need the line open. Bye kids.

I have to fifth periods. What the fuck is up with that? I have wood shop and teacher's aide, both, for fifth period. I'll drop the TA and go for wood shop, I think my cousin has it fifth period. Today I'm telling my parents that I'm moving out. Yep, leaving, gone, I'm moving in with Jen and staying that way until I go to basic training. I have nothing else to talk about.

There's bruising on both sides of my foot now, it's really gross. Because of the pain I'm in, they gave me a prescription...yeah, its Motrin! What the fuck! This sucks!! I can't do jack-shit, I can't drive, can't get a job; who's gonna hire someone who can't use their fucking arms if they have to use them to fucking walk; I'm on crutches. And another thing...my parents still expect me to hobble around and clean the house, do the dishes...its bull-shit! My mom said, "can you just do it, my kitchen really needs some cleaning." It's crap, did she forget we have three other people in the house without messed up ankles?   Well, there's one thing good going for me: my acne is quickly disappearing, my face is really smooth. It's kinda nice.

       Wearing: Talk Nerdy to Me tee-shirt, my lucky pants, studded belt, vans Listening too:My heart beating through my ears Thinking:Im really, hungry...   Well, first things first, Im going to change the font color of this blog...the whole red and black thing isn't working out. Second, Jen and I weren't doing to great a day or two ago...had some communication problems. Funny cause that doesnt make any sense; we communicate A LOT! It's just that we leave out things so that we don't hurt eachother, but now we realized honesty is really important and it's better to talk out loud instead of hestitating and keeping stuff to ourselves...hesitation is  bad . Now we're doing better, I still love her. Im going to her house after school, I just hope that works out okay. Im worried we'll be hesitant about stuff, or really quiet, or...I dunno. This is really weird it's sorta like we're going out again and we're worried that we won't like what eachother has to say so we have to put on a show or to try to be funny, or prove that we don't like eachother that much, that we have to show eachother we're cool and worth the time. That doesn't make any sense, ignore that. I just feel that being at her house today is gonna be weird. It feels like we're starting over, like...shit, I dont even know what Im talking about anymore. Ever since tuesday when that weird ominous feeling blanketed my entire being everything around me, even Jen felt it, I've felt weird. I have to go, I'll update you on what happens. Bye kids.

       Wearing: Talk Nerdy to Me tee, my lucky pants, vans, studded belt Listening too: A retarded announcement Thinking: I'm so fucked up   Okay, one; Jen wasn't wearing the ring cause she was afraid she'd lose it at work, two; I'm not as annoying anymore, only when I'm high (who isn't?). There, the two issues that butchered me two days ago are all cleared up. Isn't it great being on the outside, you guys just sit there waiting to see what's going on, the suspense building. Don't worry, I have other issues that are really starting to weigh me down. Slowly...breaking me...down. My parents suck, I don't have a job, I don't have my pink slip, I don't have my permit, I don't have my license, I can't finish my senior project, Jen and I were having problems (still kinda are), I hate Kevin (some fucker who begs Jen for any form of sexual pleasure), I FUCKING HATE KEVIN, aaannnnd--Chas (my little brother) is a backstabber. I can go on but, I can't cause I'm supposed to be doing class work. Let's just say that, I need help. Mental help. Therapy. Medication. And maybe some jeans, I don't have any jeans. The thing with Kevin is, Jen says he knows we're going out, but still he persists. The fucker is 20 years old, lives in a box in his mom's fucking garage, asks 17 year old girls for sex, he's fat, and ugly. I fucking hate him. If Jen goes out with Kelly and her friends to Kevin's moms house to get drunk and the dumb ass-hole touches her, I swear to God that if someone doesn't hold me back, I'm going kick his box down and beat the pervert with an aluminum bat. Torn ligament or not, I'll chase the fag down when he's running. Jen, I know your reading this, wear the ring, show it to him, and tell him to knock it off. As flattering as it maybe to have a guy beg for sex, don't let him. Please. Please.  I'm  beggin  you  now, but not for sex, for some...shred of what ever you'd call me beggin you to tell him to fuck off. Please. I have to go. Bye kids.

Okay, Im a little paranoid. Jen says she hates me in a loving way...ow! Am I that annoying? Holy shit, there's going to be some changes missy, and I don't just mean the changes I've made to my blog template. I gotta pull my act together. I don't want to be looked at as annoying or hated in a loving way. It's like my little sister is rubbing off on me; she's annoying but she's still me sister. Am I annoying but Im still her boyfriend. I'd say fiance but Jen hasn't been wearing her engagement ring all weekend. Who knows how long before that. Im so confused and the FUCKING BELL JUST RANG! Gosh darn it...okay okay, I'll blog later.

Jen says they're always hiring so I'm going to go ahead and apply. It'll be great, I'm planning on trying to get Jen flowers and then when I get my first pay check, I'm going to buy Jen something. Like cute pants because she doesn't have any. I know it isn't a surprise talking about it on my blog, which she does read, but now she knows she can't go out and buy jeans, cause  I  have to buy her some. Let's see, living at Jen's is great. I feel fine, she's everything I need. Oh crap , I have to go. Bye kids.

      Okay, here's something out of ZAMM. It all started with his son asking him if he believed in ghosts.  It's completely natural to think of Europeans who believed in ghosts or Indians who believed in ghost as ignorant. The scientific point of view has wiped out every other view to a point where they all seem primitive, so that if a person today talks about ghosts or spirits he is considered ignorant or maybe nutty. It's just all but completely impossible to imagine a world where ghosts can actually exist. My own opinion is that the intellect of modern man isn't that superior. IQ's aren't that much different. Those Indians and medieval men were just as intelligent as we are, but the context in which they thought was completely different. Within that context of thought, ghosts and spirits are quite as real as atoms, particles, photons and quants are to modern man. In that sense I believe in ghosts. Modern man has his ghosts and spirits too, you know. Oh, the laws of physics and of logic...the number system...the principle of algebraic substitution. These are ghosts. We just believe in them so thoroughly they seem real. For example, it seems completely natural to presume that gravitation and the law of gravitation existed before Isaac Newton. It would sound nutty to think that until the 17th century there was no gravity. So when did this law start? Has it always existed? What I am driving at is the notion that before the beginning of the earth, before the sun and the stars were formed, before the primal generation of anything, the law of gravity existed. Sitting there, having no mass of its own, no energy of its own, not in anyone's mind because there wasn't anyone not in space because there was no space either, not anywhere--this law of gravity still existed? If that law of gravity existed, I honestly don't know what thing has to do to be nonexistent. It seems to me that law of gravity has passed every test of nonexistence there is. You cannot think of a snigle attribut of nonexistence that that law of gravity didn't have. Or a single scientific attribute of existence it did have. And yet it is still 'common sense' to believe that it existed. Well, I predict that if you think about it long enough you will find yourself going round and round and round and round until you find you finally reach one possible, rational, intelligent conclusion. The law of gravity and gravity itself did not exist before Isaac Newton. No other conclusion makes sense. And what that means is that that law of gravity exists nowhere except in people's heads. It's a ghost! We are all of us very arrogant and conceited about running down other people's ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and superstitious about our own. Why does everybody believe in the law of gravity then? Mass hypnosis. In a very orthodox form known as 'education.' You've heard of the importance of eye contact in the classroom? Every deucationist emphasizes it. No educationist explains it. We believe the disembodied words of Sir Isaac Newton were sitting in the middle of nowhere billions of years before he was born and that magically he discovered these words. They were always there, even when they applied to nothing. Gradually the world came into being and then they applied to it. In fact, those words themselves were that formed the world. That is ridiculous. The problem, the contradiction the scientists are stick with, is that of mind. Mind has no matter or energy but they can't escape its predominance over everything they do. Logic exists in the mind. Numbers exist only in the mind. I don't get upset when scientists say that ghosts exist in the mind. it's that only that gets me. Science is only in your mind too, it's just that that doesn't make it bad. Or ghosts either. Laws of nature are human inventions, like ghosts. Laws of logic, of mathematics are also human inventions, like ghosts. The whole blessed thing is a human invention, including the existence whatsoever outside the human imagination. It's all a ghost, and in antiquity was so recognized as a ghost, the whole blessed world we live in. It's run by ghosts of Moses and Christ and the Buddha, and Plato, and Descartes, and Rousseau and Jefferson and Lincoln, on and on and on. Isaac Newton is a very good ghost. One of the best. Your common sense is nothing more than the voices of thousands and thousands of these ghost from the past. Ghosts and more ghosts. Ghosts trying to find their place among the living.  Because of copyright laws I have to say that none of this mine, I'm not taking credit for it. It was written by Robert M. Pirsig, none of it being my words, all his own. It's a good book.

      Wearing:Brown jacket, Jen's nova sweater underneath, toy machine tee, crappy blue jeans, cons (all of which are soaking wet) Listening too:A stupid announcement over the intercom Thinking:I...hate...this...FUCKING WEATHER!!  I'm so fucking cold!  Okay, there, I'm done whining. I'm reading this book, a very intense mind-fuck, and it's awesome. It was denied by 121 publishers before finally being published. It's that controversial. The title though, would make you put it down and say, "Fuck that, sounds dumb." Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. The trick is that you have to ignore the title altogether. It's a good book and when I get the time to, I'm going tell you about one of this guy's weird analysis-theorie thingys. It's so freaking intense and what I'm going to talk about, when I get the time, is nowhere near as complex and fucked up as the shit I've been reading...it's more like a mind-blow-job in comparison. Gotta go. Bye kids.

       Wearing:Brown jacket from the GAP ::cough cough:: beaded with rain with a dickies hoody unerneath, Finch band tee, rain-soaked dickies, soaking wet cons Listening too:Mr.Reech lecture Thinking:I feel...strangely okay   Jenny's confused and scared. She's confused on how she feels; she loves me or she's uncertain. She's scared because she doesn't know whether or not we'll make it. Ofcourse she's allowed to be scared, but your not  supposed  to know. Unless your a seer and can see the future, but who want's that power anyway? Alot of her decision making lately is due to her being influenced by whores, sluts, or weirdos. But that's besides the point. Two days ago, I broke up with her. Yeah, here's the part where you slap me and shout, "WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!" I don't know, I had tears running for about a half and hour before I cried for an hour. And I do mean crying; I'm quite the emo. I just figure the best way for her to decide whether or not she want's to be with me and walk into the unknown and figure shit out as we grow, is to give her the chance to try out not being with me. If she hates it and me being away kills her and she can't stand being around anyone else, if she's sure she wants to be with me, then we'll try again. If she's still not ready, I'm going to shut up and backoff, let her figure it out for herself b/c the only way you figure things out when your single is...you do it alone. But I'm still going to help her. I still love her. I...really miss her. I can't stand being single without her. It sucks, cause there's always a possibility someone else will come along and take her from me while she's single, even though she says there's no chance and doesn't want anyone else. That's where I'm confused. She doesn't want anyone else  and  she isn't sure if she wants  me . I just can't wait until she's ready and all I can do is talk to her and help her decide a little quicker cause...I only have four months until we're apart for 6 more. Gotta go. Bye kids.

Alright guys, I've got my own blog, but it's fun to post on other's blogs too.  Chris and I might be taking a road trip to Salem this spring....IT'S GOING TO BE  AWESOME   I can't wait...really.  I'm gonna have to feed my parents some bullshit story, but I don't mind that bad.  As long as I have fun right?!?!  Everybody should go to my blog after Chris edit's it for me.  I chose the simple one, because I like it, but I think it needs more....SHAZAM! Added to it, maybe the word I was looking for was spunk, I'm not sure right now.  Oh well, I'll see all you kids later, maybe at Jen's house on sunday, there's going to be a party there, consisting of me and Chris, and Jen, and possibly Courtney, but nobody else, SO DON'T THINK OF GOING OVER THERE, I WILL KILL YOU AND EAT YOUR BABYS!

In fact, I made none after those two dollars from Jen's dad. Guess I should have tried asking for money in the first place. Um, today I might be going to Trever Dorsey's house and then sunday rob is coming over for a little while and then I might go to his place and stay the night; we don't have school on monday. YES!! I don't know what else to talk about. Oh oh, you know how much it sucks being 18. Well, only sometimes, but when your the only one who can buy cigarettes, you have to go with whoever wants them. I'm cool with it, but I can see how I could get tired of it. I'm fine with it as long as I get something out of it, like a cig or some gum...you know? Has to be a mutual effort to make everyone happy. Okay I'm going to go now. Bye kids.

       Wearing:Relient K band tee, dickies, vans Listening too:AFI Thinking:My toe hurts sooo bad   Last night I rolled my foot fowards, practically bending all my toes down so they could touch the bottom of my foot. Does that make sense? Either way it hurts like hell and its gay because all the pain is focused on one point, my big toe. It couldn't "even" it out, no, it has to terrorize my fucking big toe. My poor toe. If any of you guys see me walking around school, I would sincerely appreciate it if you contributed to the "Fix Chris' Toe" fund. Any amount of money will be accepted, no one's stopping you from emptying your wallet to help a poor emo fix his poor toe. Maybe for a little enthusiasm I would be glad to let you know that so far, the FCT have made two dollars from the following donators:Mike Burns...okay, that's it. Thank you for your time and please consider. Enough of that. I've been living at Jen's house and it's great. We seriously have no problems. None. We're...perfect. It's great; there's nothing wrong with us, nothing going on. We're just happy:). I have a friend who's having problems in a relationship where the other person is treating my friend like shit, my friend doesn't want to leave the other but they've found someone who they could be happy with, someone nicer and not a demanding asshole. I think my friend should dump the ass they're going out with right now and go for the other person. I'm not saying names because it's none of your business you freakin vultures, circling above me waiting for me to drop...fuckers...I'm not doing it, not saying anything. I kNOW NOTHING, NOOOOOTHING!!

It'll be great. Rob and Travis are staying the night and Courtney might too. I feel bad for Travis cause he won't get stoned with us. He'll be surrounded by four stoned individuals and who knows what we might do to him. We already got make up on him and he was sober. What a flamer. Its been a good day lately except for how tired I am. Im on the edge; every little thing that I shouldn't take seriously I actually do...just a little though, I dont get mad it just...I react a little, not physically but emotionally; I get all quiet and force myself to relax cause I know they aren't doing it on purpose. Its mostly Jen, she says something bitchy cause she's cranky and it gets at me...then she says sorry. That annoys me; why say sorry if you meant it. Its okay though, most of my problems are exactly that; my problems. I just need to relax and get baked. S'all good, g dogg. Bye kids.

Well, I just got back from the office to get my bag; my cousin and I mixed up our back packs. The first words out of his mouth were, "Oh my god, that's gay." He's such an ass. Seriously, he's a spoiled, born prep. An upperclass asshole who thinks he's better than everyone. If I mention that I'm in cisco, he goes off on some bullshit how it's easy and how he's going to take it and ace it. He's super smart and everyone else is below him. I freaking hate that about him. One of these days he's going to get put down and he won't like it, I would but I'm not that kind of person. I'm better than him. He says my mom just went to San Francisco cause she's so distraught. Is my piercing that big of a dramatic change in her life that makes her runaway to family down south? I love my mother but she has issues. She says she got therapy after she left home when she was younger...but I don't think it was enough. I dunno how I'm going to deal with all this shit. I have to go. Bye kids.

Meaning we'll get one day in Salem when we arrive, one full day after that, and then the few hours when we're leaving. This totally blows!! I'm expected to convince a suicide not to kill himself in one day...I hate this. I lost my cd case somewhere. I emailed Jen to look in my room b/c I think I left it in the computer lab next to my 6th period. Before firtst period I went to the lab and looked for it and found nothing. This totally blows, I hope it's in my room. I thought it was in my back pack, I don't remember taking it out, but when I opened my bag and didn't see a fucking cd case, I nearly shit my self. I have to go. Bye kids.

We're going to be leaving there on tuesday. It's gonna suck cause it's a twelve hour trip and we're riding in coach. It's totally gonna blow. In my boredom I took some quiz at  urlLink   and found out what kind of wings I have. So, here goies:    You are one of the few out there whose wings are truly  ANGELIC . Selfless, powerful, and divine, you are one blessed with a certain cosmic grace. You are unequalled in peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of Light your wings are massive and a soft white or silver. Countless feathers grace them and radiate the light within you for all the world to see. You are a defender, protector, and caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver of the wrong, chances are you are taken advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often. But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in everyone and so this mistreatment does not make you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will try to help misguided souls find themselves and peace. However not all Angelics allow themselves to be gotten the better of - the Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting for the sake of Justice and protection of those less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever change - the world needs more people like you.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I don't know why I'm still blogging...I need someone to talk to and there's no one at school in this class I can vent with. I hate it here, everyone here has no consideration or discretion...no one here care's. "Well, someone died on the weekend...yeah it's sad........WEEELL, we need to move on, for lunch today..." is all they have to say for the three people that have died this week. Atleast in Oregon if my brother takes his life he'll get some attention or someone will grieve for him; around here people hardly even get a second thought while in Oregon they actually give a damn. I'm blogging cause my blog is the one thing I can use to calm down...well, it doesn't work out that well because now I have to go.

This morning my twin brother Corey sent me an email stating that he was going to kill himself. He said that he was going to cut his wrists. I, ofcourse, replied to him that he shouldn't, that people care for him...he told me to fuck off; he said not to love him, to tell everyone else not to love him because he didn't deserve love. My own flesh and blood told me not to care for him, to forget about whatever feelings I held for him and to back off and allow him to take his own life. I don't know what to do...what do you to do to stop your brother from taking his own life when he lives 400 miles away. The only thing that I could do is beg and pleade...  I'm scared and I don't know what to do...

It was nice and long and went by slowly. Rob dyed his hair black, it looks cool, and we (Jen, Rob, Courtney, and I) all got stoned. It was fun, I slept great. Not much is going on...after everyone left sunday, it was really nice, you know? Jen and I got to relax and just lay around together. It was a big relief despite how much fun we had. I was getting tired of everyone being over around sunday morning. Not much towards Rob, just...I didn't want to go anywhere and I was really tired. The ball in my lip piercing came out and we lost it so we went to the Darkside to get a new one. They were closed so we went to the Underground. We got one for two bucks and the guy working there put it in for free. They dont even do piercings there; he said he knew how to do it so he just did it. Well, I don't know what else to talk about.

       Wearing: Desaperacidos band tee, levis, checkered vans Listening too: A bunch of retards in the library Thinking: All day I've been puting on an act as to not look as upset or pissed off as I really am   Last night my brother calls around 8:30 pm, a little unexpected, but accepted either way. He tells me instantly that he'll be arriving tomorrow(today)around 10 in the morning and he could possibly stay with me. I was so excited...then, with the excitment in his voice, tells me how he ODed on drugs monday night. They had to pump his stomach through a tube they forced down his throat. He was under cardiac arrest, flat lining off and on--on the heart monitor. The bastard would have died if he was an hour late. My fucking dumbass brother would have died and he get's off on it like it was a joy ride. Every time he does something like that to himself he seems so excited about it when he's talking to me, as if it was so much fucking fun!! It pisses me off. Everytime he hurts himself like that, it hurts me mentally and emotionally. If he keeps doing this, I'm going to turn into a cold hearted bastard...I was so upset, still am, and I don't know what to do. We went down to see him on the weekend and it didn't change anything; hours after we leave he goes back to drugs like it's nothing...nothing...he shattered all the joy had for him. Shattered.

I came to school today, I wasn't going to but I have alot of absences and I really need to make up some work. My senior project show case is due sometime this month.

       Wearing: Starting Line band tee, studded belt, crappy jeans, sweat band, fossil watch Listening too: CNN Thinking:...fuck, I dunno   Well, Jen and I arrived at home around...2:30 this morning. We were without any kind of music for atleast 3 days. It totally sucked. The train was okay on the way up, there was a weird guy on a shit load of drugs walking up and down the train cars and the attandents were fucking pmsing the whole trip. We got a motel together with a king size bed and a padlock on the door...so you know what we were doing at our heart's delight. Corey was okay, we had fun. I took Jen out to dinner, out to breakfast, walked around downtown, met Corey at an arcade in the mall --a mall so big it takes up four blocks-- and then we hung at his place, his girlfriends. It was nice, we played video games and had hamburgers. The next day we hung out at the train station for a couple of hours talking to Corey, convincing him to decide not to kill himself. I think it worked; his mood from when we first saw him from when we we're leaving was a huge difference. I think his major problem is his girlfriend; she's...depressing. When ever they're together they argue and talk about depressing shit, never putting their problems aside and deciding to look at what's infront of them...eachother. On top of that, Corey's other problem is me. Without Corey I'm not a whole person, its weird cause we're twins and we have "the bond" or "the special connection." And not only is it tearing me apart, its tearing him apart and he doesn't know it. He says that he needs to find the one thing that keeps him sane or helps him cope with his problems...something or one like me. He says its out there but he can't find it...he doesn't know that he doesn't have to look for it, it will come if he lets it. He doesn't want to be loved for some sick reason. In the end I think he'll be okay. On the way back, this guy got Jen and I drunk on the train. It was fun but we were really tired afterwards and had some trouble getting comforable and falling asleep. I'm not sure what else to talk about so I'm going to go now. Bye kids.

Then I posted a link and that's it. Yep, I got bored so I did it. I'm thinking about configuring it a bit, you know, making it look nicer so as to match up with the site itself. I hope to get it done this weekend, maybe even get some background music. I have nothing else to do, I mean, it's not like it takes my hours to pick out a few articles of clothing. Okay, I'm going to go now. Bye again, kids.

       Ha!! I Will Get Post Titles Even if I Have to Cheat!!  Okay, so I'm not cheating...I just added a title in the post section. whatever. Not much has happened today. Oh oh, I almost got in a fight with some gay hick. He was messing with some little kid so I pushed him, you know, see how he likes it. He decided to join in on the pushing contest and push me which in turn caused me to slam him into a door a couple of times. He didn't even force me to flinch when he tried pushing me so he decided to result to a hasty get-a-away with a barrage of vulgar language. You know, crap like "Your gay for pushing me. Why do you keep pushing me? Are you gay?" I decided to push him into a desk. Ofcourse I'm not gay. I'm engaged to a beautiful woman and frankly, I get more action than his insestious parents do.   ...I hate hicks

       Wearing: 5 Minute Walk Records tee, blue jeans, studded belt and Jen's buckle, vans Listening too: Extremely immature freshman and sophomores that won't shut the fuck up Thinking: It's so hard to keep from ripping their spliens out   They're so stupid; one of them is fat and smells really bad (BO), the other is fat also and has a mullet, and the last is tall and skinny with areally bad hair cut. They won't shut up..."Hehe, stickdeaththeatre.com is so cool, man, "yeah, whoa, look dude, that's sooo cool..." I want this period to end. I'm in the library because there's nothing to do in Business Math and he allowed me to come in here and let the rest of the period to end. I hate these guys...white trash cocky hicks...they're so fucking dumb. The weekend went by kinda quickly. Mostly consisted of me being really tired, went to Trever's house friday night, did yard work on sunday...saturday was okay, I saw Ghost in the Shell for the five hundredth time with Jen...she was hestitant to watch it but after she did, she thought it was awesome and wants to buy it. I have nothing else to talk about. Bye kids.

       TGIFF  It's friday, that means its a good day. I stayed home yesterday, woke up feeling like shit so I slept in. Watched a MXC Marathon all day. That show is so funny. Tomorrow Trevor is coming over. We might just sit around and get stoned. He wants to bring the other Trevor but Tina doesn't want too many people over so I have to think of a way to break it to him nicely. They're like bestfriends. Well, there's nothing else to talk about. Bye kids.

       6th Period  This is so cool. We have fifteen minutes until class is over. then i get to go home, yes!! today has been pretty quiet, all day the office has been packed with people crying. i still feel pretty bad. five people in three months is really fucking ridiculous! just because im 18 and i dont really care, and because kids are dieing atleast twice a month, they should make the drivers license age requirement 18 years of age. its pretty dumb how fast kids are driving, and how fast they're dieng. cottonwood is a fucking graveyard. On a different note, i wrote a poem yesterday. its that marquee underneatht the title. you should read it, im told its pretty good. i almost wrote another song but it just turned into a poem, im not sure if it could be a song...well, i dont know what else to talk about it. bye kids.

       Grief At West Valley  Jay Windell's sister died yesterday in a car accident along with another girl, a freshman (I think). I saw Jay this morning before class started and he was tearing quite a bit, his face was really red. I feel so bad for the guy. There were two more people in the accident and right now they're in critical condition. Everyone knows their chances of making it are slim. They won't survive. It's such a waste when they're so young like that. I mean, two were fifteen, one just got out of highschool, and the fourth was young like the others. It's such a waste.

       Long Day  I can already tell that today is going to be a long day. This morning started out with Jen and Tina getting in an argument. I hate being around that kind of feeling. It's nostalgic. I hated the figthing at my house and now there's some at Jen's. It's okay though, I can handle it just fine. Im almost jaded, but...I don't like seeing Jen, or Tina, crying. Especially when I have to leave and there's nothing I can do about it. Im also freaking out a little. I'm a little superstitious and I've seen the number 23 four times. I think some thing is going to happen. Let's see, it's 3/23 and I've seen the number 23 four times, if I see it one more time I'm going to freak out. Bye kids.

       So I Wrote A Song, Eat Me  That's my song...right there, to your...left. Yeah, wrote it in 4th period. I hate econ. I don't know who I wrote it for, but after Jen read it she said she really like it and it was to my brother, the suicidal, the bipolar border-line skitso, the guy that applies to the song basically. I asked Jen's mom to read it, and, after she read it, she cried. Apparently she had a terrible day and the message I was aiming for really got to her. I feel kinda bad. Must'a had a bad day. Well, that's all I have to talk about. Bye kids.

       Split Habit Sucked!  I went to a show saturday night after shopping with Jen. It was nice, had time for that and for my friends. I got a pair of jeans, a Fender tee cause I couldn't find anything else, and a Nirvana band tee. I also got some tube socks and a pair of sandals. It was nice. At the show we hung out with Tever Dorsey, his maybe-girlfriend Lindsey, Corey's old bestfriend Jessica, and Trever Gayman, along with Maria Sullivan (Kelly's sister). That' s who Jen rode with. I got a ride from Rob and Travis. I got really wasted cause I smoked pot and drank vodka. It was pretty weird. Jen left early and I stayed until 10:00 pm. After that, Rob, Travis, and I took Megan and Larissa home in Anderson. Then we had to go all the way back to Happy Valley where Travis' mom picked Travis and I up and then they dropped me off at my house. It was a long and eventful night. Well, that's all for now. Bye kids.

Im stuck on the bitchiest part of the game yet in Enter the Matrix. Im inside of a goddamn airport control tower thingy and a fucking helicopter keeps showing up and shooting at me. I can't kill a fucking helicopter. I'm not Neo! Well, the bell ring so I have to go...later.

       [I'm Rob]  Well, I have the ability to post on here, and so I'm going to.  Chris is leaving soon, to go to the military.  Bootcamp.  He's like, one of my best friends, and he's leaving.  It blows.  I guess it's kinda selfish, but I can't help it.  If he were staying, we'd start a band.  He's a talented musician, especially for somebody who's stil starting.  And his lyrics are....magnificent.  I really hope that I can move to the city he's stationed, so that we can start a band.  So Jen, don't uhh, let him quit playing.  Don't ever let him stop being Chris, because that'd be like....the worst thing that would ever happen to him.  I figured, since he's only posting about being tired, and basically being in highschool, I'd post about something sentemental.

Asheigh B. wants Jen to do her hair on saturday for prom, Rob wants me to stay the night friday night and help him work saturday, then saturday afternoon I'm going to go get my book bound with my parents.

Well, there...I posted, so HAH! Back to the subject on me being really tired. Last night I was up until 11 watching An Evening With Kevin Smith. It was pretty funny. And, inturn from being up late, I'm fucking tired. I'm going home today and taking a nap. I'm fucking tired. Bye kids.

       I Just Realized How Fucking Nerdy That Last Post Was  ...and I'm sorry. Well, my spring break was alright. Minus the feeling like shit because my parents didn't show up at my senior board presentation at the Mt.Shasta Mall at the start of my spring break (you know, to kick off my break with a depressing start is always good), the guilt trips from Jen that made me openly pissed at her (which did scare her quite a bit) and then of course Trever Dorsey's lack of hanging out with us. His mom kept bring little kids over for him to baby sit. That's so dumb, I mean, what a waste of a spring break. This weekend I'm getting my book bound at kinkos and then there's a party at Jen's friend's boyfriend's house or something...it's his birthday. Everyone wish Erac a happy birthday. Yes, that's Erac with an "a." Well, I'm going to go now, go to Rob's new  urlLink  blog . Bye kids.

      That's all I really have to say. Not much has happened today. When I woke up this morning it was so hard to stay awake. Jen and Tina got me out of bed and had me sit on the couch, you know, to make sure I wouldn't go to bed. Shit I was exhausted, it was nearly impossible to keep my eyes open. Then I came to school, oh, I haven't told you guys; Trever Dorsey, a great friend of mine, maybe even a best friend, gives me a ride not only from school but to school. It's great, ever since he started picking me up in the morning I've gotten an extra half-hour of sleep. That's a lot in my book. After school I'm going with Rob to some kid's house. We're gonna jam out on guitar for awhile. Ofcourse I'm the better bassist so I'm a neccessity. Then we're going to Rob's house and I'm staying the night there. Saturday I'm going to make some money working for some old ladies, apparently, from what Rob has gathered, we're going to make atleast thirty bucks each. And you know what I'm going to do with all that? I'm going to buy Jen a CD, well, two CDs. The Hippos and Cursive's latest album (I think), Domestica. She's going to buy me Bright Eyes: Lifted or The Story is in The Soil, Keep Your Ear to The Ground. I can't wait. Well, I've written a lot and I'm going to go now. Bye kids.

       Not Fair  I have a new found love for Bright Eyes. They have to be, thee greatest band alive! Holy SHIT! Lover I Don't Have to Love, Make War, Bowl of Oranges, Nothing Gets Crossed Out, Blue Christmas, Don't Know When But a Day is Gonna Come...those songs are so fucking good! Lifted or The Story is in The Soil Keep Your Ear to The Ground is apparently, from the songs I've listened too, is an awesome album. Hungry for a Holiday, performed not just by Bright Eyes, but also the Album Leaf...is a great song also. I'm...I don't know, I'm just awe struck. Their lyrics, their guitar, their beat and their god damn rythm...FUCK!! I want to be an awesome musician. It's not fair...

       Not Too Much To Say  Um...Jenny and I are doing good. Apparently the flowers I bought her yesterday weren't the greatest of flowers to choose from, but she says it's the thought that counts. Well, today Courtney is giving me a ride after school. I'd ride with Trever but that means Gayman has to squeeze in the back and I don't think that's very fair for him. I mean, he's a big guy. I'm little. Corey's blog is up and running and I don't have the slightest clue where he got the skin. It's really odd. And I won't comment any further because it's his personal blog and I should respect it. Whatever. Well, I'm gonng go now. Bye kids.

Thank god I'm not addicted. I'm just going to quit, atleast I have two months until I get tested. I mean, with two months of being clean I know I'll be popping up negative when they drug test me for the Army.

       Wrap Up  Okay, I had one long eventful weekend. Friday I went to Rob's house, that was pretty fun, then saturday him and I went and worked at this old lady's house. We made ten bucks (which I'm saving up for my fiance and I, we're having our one year anniversary). Then I got home and found Jen doing Ashleigh B's hair and makeup for prom, cause Jen is a pro at that kind of stuff. Then, about two hours later, I went and played paintball with my next door neighbor and seven other people. That was fun, I kicked ass. Oh oh, when I came home saturday, Jen and her parents surprised me with their new HDTV. It's so bad ass. I'm going to play video games on it tomorrow after school. It's gonna be bad ass. Then, today, from about eleven in the morning to two in the afternoon, we rearranged the living room; basically, we moved the new tv to where the couch is and the couch to where the tv is. It looks nice. Well, I don't know what else to talk about. It's late so I'm going to bed. Go to my bro's blog,  urlLink  blind-memorys  . I know, he miss spelled memories, I'll let him know. Okay, that's it. Bye kids.

      Today sucks...there is absolutely nothing to do. I'm bored as hell too. After school, Trev and I are going to my place, then he's going to leave his truck there when Rob comes to get us and we're going to go play with the band. Cause it's Friday, and we schedule to play, every friday. That's about it. Yesterday I jobshadowed Tina. Which sucked. I was there for nine and a half hours. I read the entire Matrix script, which is better than the movie, then I looked at the storyboards and conceptual art. It was  way  bettter than the movie. In fact, I got a scriptwriter software and now I'm rewriting my novel, Obscenity: The Fallen, into a script. It sounds way better, not to sound cocky or stuck up, but it does. Well, I have to go, er, I want to go. There's nothing to do. Bye kids.

      Rob(lead guitar), Trever Dorsey(soon to be drummer), some kid named Chris(current drummer), his older brother Dan(rythm guitar and wants to be vocals), and I(bassist and contimplating vocals) have started a band. Dan wanted to call it The Nomads...but that's really gay. So I said, "Hey, we're a make-shift band, why not call ourselves Make-Shift?"I was also thinking, would the name Make-Shift Wings be a good band name. Sounds too emo though. I don't know. Friday the band and I played for five hours. My fingers are blistered and calissed really badly. But it was still fun. There isn't anything else to talk about. So...I guess I'll see ya gu--shit! I forgot to tell you about this weekend. We didn't make any money on saturday. The bitch ditched us. So around three in the afternoon, Jen and I went to Trever Dorseys (the coolest kid in the world, I mean, he's more of a friend than anyother friend I've encountered. He's not an ass is anyway. All my other friend's talked shit, it was unavoidable...but Trev is...cool), and we played guitar, drums, halo on xbox...you know, shit that guys do. Jen was cool to have around, she was really cool about our forms of entertainment; she was another one of the guys all day. Then, from 9:30 to midnight, Trev, Jen and I went on a booze hunt. We were looking for anyone or anyway to get alcohol for us. We basically spent the three and a half hours going back and forth between three different gas stations and waiting in parking lots. It sucked. Then, ten minutes to 12, we dropped Jen off at home cause she wasn't feeling good. And, in a last ditch effort, we went to Chevron. As soon as we got there we found someone. It was perfect, like they were waiting for us to give them our money and buy us alcohol. We got a bottle of Green Apple Twist Smirnoff Vodka. Which is 70 proof, i.e. 35% alcohol. That means, one ounce(shot) is a beer. And I had atleast ten shots. Trever had around 8, and everone else; Trever Gayman and Crazy Mike, had about three of four. And for Gayman to have four shots/beers...that isn't very much, he's a big guy. Basically, Trev got feel-good-drunk, I got plastured and vomitted five times, and Gayman and Mike got buzzed. That's about it. Oh, it's really sad how Trev and I went through, not one, but 2! packs of cigarettes that day. I know that sounds really bad, but...if you think about it, its just one pack for the each of us. Ummmm, that's about it. I gotta go. Bye kids.

      Okay, so someone entitled "The Leech King" commented on my last post. The only person who ever called himself the Leech King was JT...Justin Thomas Bishop...my only bestfriend freshman year. He graduated last year, so he's basically a year older than me and probably living somewhere else now, in Salem, and out of reach. I haven't been able to contact him cause the crapface doesn't check his email anymore. And now he comments on my blog...how did he find my blog? why didn't he leave me a phone number or an email address? Probably some asshole playing a prank, I'm not going to take the time to figure out whether or not it was him. If it is, he'll say something. Till then, bye kids.

      I was up until 12:30 last night watching the Last Samurai. It was actually pretty good, I thought Tom Cruise would ruin it be he...didn't. Although, I always had a weird feeling when the camera would just stay focused on him...it was something along the lines..."Does Tom Cruise have down syndrome?" He just looks like a drunk throughout the entire movie. I mean, sure the bastard was a crazy alcoholic who learned how to sword fight...not a very catchy synopsis...but, WTF?! I was thrown off throughout the entire movie, he either, one: had a hangover on set, or two:was just outright plastered. Well, that's all I got to say about that. Today, after school in about 25 minutes, Rob and I have to go to some CISCO presentation. I don't know what we're doing, I know I don't have to speak in front of anyone, I just know we're going and we'll get extra credit. Woopty doo. There's just one catch. Rob doesn't know if I will have a ride home. "That's GREAT!! Sheesh Rob, let's get going...maybe I'll get stuck in the middle of nowhere just long enough to get raped and murdered!" He says that if we don't have enough gas, he'll take us to his house before we go, we'll get the car, and then'll we go to the presentation. Sounds good I guess. Well, I'm sleepy, running on five hours of sleep, and I have nothing to say. Bye kids.

      Today isn't actually too boring. I mean, it's not good, it's not bad...it's just, tuesday. Let's see, in fourth period, Ryan actually typed his section of the econ project and turned it in, then he's going to email it to me so that I can write out our group speech (cause I'm the better writer), and then Dusty turned in his paper, which is even cooler...cause he's going to email his too. It's going by nice. 3rd period was okay, Courtney and I finished the little assignment that Mr. Roach gave us and then we left and sat on a bench and talked about the future. I told her about how I want to write and sell my script for Obscenity:The Fallen...I mean, Good Will Hunting, which sucked, sold for $300,000...and that's cheap in the movie bizz; actors and directors make millions! I just hope it all works out. So far, I'm on page 24 of my script...I got atleast two hundred and fifty more to go. Then I have to find the Wachowski brother's email address so that I can tell them about me, my age, my interests, and then I'll rope them in with the script. I think they'd like it, I like it, my friends like it, my friends think it could be an anime or a movie. It would be great. I even have ideas that would save directors and producers a lot of money. I mean, if they use what I call anime-time (which is essentially like bullet-time, only, when the movie goes into a dramatic scene or a fight scene, everything goes into Japanese Animation!) because they don't have to pay for too much training for their actors so that they know kung fu, they don't have to worry about stunt-doubles...all because the stunt doubles and martial artists...ARE CARTOONS! I think it's  a genius idea, I may just be a little farfetched. I'll never make it big; your born then you die. Bye kids.

      Well, I guess I'll update you on the weekend and had it all went... Friday: Rob, Jen, Trev, and I all went to Trev's barn and jammed for about three or four hours. It was fun, all though we're really struggling. I sound like indie rock, Rob is rob (metal/punk), and Trev is just whatever...what I'm saying is, we don't really have a paticular genre or anything. So it's kinda frustrating. After that Jen and I went home, and I don't remember what happened next. Saturday: Basically stayed home...watched a lot of TV, slept in, cleaned up a little. Trev came for over for a little while and then we watched Death to Smoochy until about 7:30 pm. Then from 8 to, like...11, Jen and I watched anime. We saw Wolf's Rain for the first time, and it was freaking awesome. It's so gay though how it's only on for half of an hour and only saturday nights, I WANT MORE WR! We also saw Fury Kury, or Fooly Kooly (same thing), and that show was really cool. I'm not even going to explain it to you, just watch it saturday nights, you'll like it. Sunday: We cleaned the house and watched TV. That's really all there is to say.  Cleaned. TV. That's it. Trev came over for about half of an hour then we got some pizza, and then he left. Bam, my whole sunday revolving around sitting around. That's my whole weekend. And today's monday and it's a good day cause it went by soooo fast. It was great. Bye kids.

      there, I changed it. in that pic, it was the morning after a night of being extremely stoned out of my mind, I was sooo tired; didn't get to bed until 1 or 2 in the morning. that's a sweater and that's a dress shirt underneat of it. I dunno how I ended up like that, I told Maria I was cold so she got me a sweater.

      Thank God it's freaking Friday!! Today, 5:30ish, Rob is picking me up for Megan's b-day party. Then we go get her a b-day present (i.e. cigs) and after that we pick up Jen and go to the party in Millville. Where the hell is Millville?! I thought she lived in Anderson!! Oh well, till then, peace out. Bye kids.

      Well, I have had this window open for about five minutes and just started to write. And nwo I have to go...I'll post later on when I get the time. Later guys.  Okay, here's the rest. Next week on tuesday I have to do my senior project speech...which is gonna suck. I have to be dressed up, so I don't know what I'm going to wear. I don't have any good slacks. Let's see, what else? This weekend I might be doing some community service, which is also gonna suck. SHIT, I HATE SCHOOL! Trev-Or is really pissed that I'm leaving for the ARMY. I'm pissed too, but the Army is going to pay for my college. Which I must tell you about. Okay, it's Westwood College, a private college, and they have an awesome system for teaching. For starters, most colleges only give you about 30% training in what ever it is you wanna master in, but Westwood does just the opposite. You get 70% of your education in your masters and 30% in general ed. That's sooo cool. They'll get you a job after you graduate (and it only takes about two years to get your bachelors) and within six months to a year, you can be making close to $120,000 a year. That's freaking awesome. I mean, isn's that like ten thousand a month without tax. And without tax probably close to 7 or 8. That's so cool! I'm going to get my bachelors in Game Art and Design, that's where all the money is coming from. And then I'm looking to get a bachelors or an associates in Game Software Devoloping. It's gonna be great. I can't wait until I'm making money. And then I'm going to publish my two books and sell them, and them I'm going to sell my script...and all the while, I'm going to be living in an apartment with my fiance/eventual-wife. It's gonna be great. Bye kids.

      Okay, everyone who knows me...don't call, don't ask, don't invite, don't suggest...I'm not doing anything for the rest of the week or for the weekend. It's not because I'm spending time with Jen, it's because I have to crack down; I need to graduate. I have so much to do. I'm going to do some community service because Mr. Main says it will help my grade a lot. I don't know what else to say, don't call...

      Okay, so I changed the look of my blog...I mostly just wanted to have an archive index. That's about it...oh, I wanted to add some of the changes that blogger made to my blog so it was more  interesting . Bye kids.

      They changed the format of blogger.com, it looks more...I dunno, cleaner and a lot more user friendly. I liked it before though. Let's see, I'll give you a pretty break down of my weekend. Friday: Got drunk at Trev's and watched Night at the Roxbury. We slept in a camping tent in a barn. That's Cottonwood for ya.  Saturday: Talked to JT via AIM for a couple of hours, then went to a show until 10:30. Got home and watched WR and the first fifteen minutes of FLCL; passed out on the couch. Sunday: Went to Barnes and Noble and Wal-Mart to get my mom some awesome Mothers Day gifts; the latest from author Terry Brooks, a bubble bath home spa basket, and a box of chocolates, an Almond Joy (its her favorite), and lastly: a card. Then I talked to JT some more, messed with the web cam after downloading the latest versions of AIM and MSN Messenger. MSN Messenger, in my opinion, is way better. Then I watched some Futurama and ATHF (Aqua Teen Hunger Force).  Monday: Woke up when Mike said goodbye; he's going to the beach for the week because of his job. Then went back to sleep, woke up, got dressed and brushed my teeth, had a cig, and came to school. There...my entire weekend. Bye kids.

      Let's see...  Today was Senior Ditch Day sooo I didn't go to school. I called the school posing as Trev's dad (Randy) and got him out of school for the day. It was awesome. So he came over, we smoked a pack of cigs, had two beers each, watched Boondock Saints...now, before I go on, I must elaborate on this movie. Boondock saints is about two Irish zealots (religious finatics) but they aren't toooo religious. Just enough to be freaking cool. That's all I'm gonna say. Well, after that we went and got Jen around 1...got some more cigs, smoked some more until, oh, I dunno, and hour and half. Then he left and entertainment went down hill, along with my buzz. Well, I don't know what else to talk about. Bye kids.

      My parents have a thing with pushing my guilt trip button...they push that button and I fold. It's a problem I have, in fact, like Tina (Jen's mom), I'm probably going to need therapy because its such a Huge problem. There's nothing I can do about it, I've been raised to fold at my parents every whim, so when they say something, out of natural instinct/reaction/thought process, I fold.  more  When I was....about 7...my neighbor (a male teenager, probably 18 or 23, hard to tell) malestedmy brother Corey and I. So there, I told you...I'm a victim of disgust in it's purist form and there's nothing I can do about it except-- accept it. That's all I can do and I have accepted it, I've accepted my passed, I've already had those tears.  So there, you got the details, now do me a favor and leave it at that.

      so, today is wednesday, which means yesterday was my senior speech. it really sucked. the minium time requirement to pass is 8 minutes, i got 9 minutes and 24 seconds. it was awesome. so, i passed that part of the speech...but there's a problem, i don't know what my over all grade is. after my speech (i went first) three other seniors went up and presented and then we left, that's it, the head judge (mr.proscher) got up and said, "okay seniors, thank you for your presentations. you may leave now." then we left and that was the end of it. so now, all i'm doing is waiting for my freaking grade. another thing that i have yet to explain is The Day of Acception...and i'm not going to do it right now, maybe later on today; i just have the time to get into details and stuff. bye kids.

      Weekend was okay...on friday megan's party was fun, saturday was alright (saw Envy, which sucked), and sunday was alright; drove a little in French Gulch. Now, today is the day that really got to me. Didn't happen till...7ish...but I accepted the fact that I'm fucked up and need therapy. Jen knows what's going on, so if I don't tell you, she will. Don't worry, its not between her and I, we're doing great.....Bye kids.

      I'm dead serious. Is it tuesday or wednesday...I can't figure it out. Gimme a sec. Um...  ...  Shit, I just dunno. It's tuesday, I'll just go with that. Oh well. So, what's happened? Let's see...uh, I'm out of cigarettes, which sucks. Last night Teri came over and she watched about half of LOTR: Return of the King, and I have one comment to say about that. Um...I'm done...this is a really lame and short post. sorry. Bye kids.

      I'm so freaking hungry. My stomach is eating itself, I can feel it caving in. Pretty soon I'll take a shit and my intestines will fall out. I just need some food. A lot of food in fact. Um, I don't know what to talk about, at all...I'm just hungry and bored so I've decided to write in my blog, again. And now I'm leaving my blog. Bye kids.

      ...today is so boring. today is so boring. today is so boring. today is so fucking boring. This Friday is Day on the Green (DOG) and for some reason, they're (the principals and shit) saying that no visitors are allowed on campus. Whish is fucking stupid. So, Trevor and I decided to say, "Fuck off, Mr. K!" and then we're gong to get Jen from work and take her to Satan's Asshole, anyway. She wants to go to DOG, so she's going. Ain't nothing Mr. K can do about it. It's third period right now, I finished the little assignment that Mr. R gave us and have plenty of time to spare. So I'm in the library. With...nothing...to...do. Actually, blogging on the ole' blog was my last resort, that's how important you are to me today. I'm so fucking bored ( and  tired) that I don't want to do anything. Not even sit in front of a blue-glow monitor and type about how shitty today is. What else...this weekend; no, next weeked, I'm gonna have Trev come over...and maybe some other friends. I dunno. Either way, it'll be great; his mom is leaving, she'll be gone, the house will be empty the 3rd of June through the 6th. That's fan-fucking-tastic. Freaking  awesome . So, I'm gonna make Trev come over for awhile around 11pm. Why so later, cause I'll be at my grad party my family's holding. yay. Then I'll get home around 10:30, Jen and I will have sex, then Trev can come over. But I'm not to sure if he should stay the night, someone needs to watch the house and Jen and I need some time to...do it...again...and maybe again. Sorry, but we have to. It just so happens that Jen's parents will be gone the 5th through the 6th. That gives us time to get rowdy. Well, there isn't much to talk about, so...Bye kids.

      Okay, today sucked. This morning I wake up, clean the kitchen, clean the living room, vacum the house (living room, my room, hallway, dining room), did some laundry, and finished when I mowed the front lawn. Then I did some 1-73 vocab economic terms shit. Took me awhile, it sucked.  but  Things cleared up when Jen went to Redding and came back with a house/cradle for Bartlebee (our new kitten), a collar (which is pink), and some little cat nip toy thingys. So yeah, today has been pretty up and down. Bye kids.

      Okay, I'm posting. And I'm pissed. Here's why I'm pissed: I walk to the library so that Ms. Sheldon can sign my graduation paper thing stating that all my books are turned in and I don't have to pay for any debts so that I can graduate. Well, apparently I have an 8 dollar bill on a damaged algebra 1 book. I never took algebra 1! I bet it's Chas' (my brother), I bet he's the bastard that's keeping me 8 dollars away from graduating. The really gay part about all that is that today is the last day of school and I'm graduating in two days. That means I have to think of a way to pay for it during my break! JUST SO I CAN WALK UP TO THE PODIUM TO RECIEVE A FUCKING DIPLOMA JACKET CAUSE THEY'RE TOO FUCKING DUMB TO GIVE ME MY FUCKING DIPLOMA!! I mean, you the know the reason they can't do it is because they don't have them. They don't have them done yet cause they're too busy with their FOC!! A Faculty Orgy Celebration...I hate this school...
