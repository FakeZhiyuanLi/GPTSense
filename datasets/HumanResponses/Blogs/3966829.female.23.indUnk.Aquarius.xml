      Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who can't find a job. I know that's not true but it gets so frustrating. There are so many things that I want to do and have but it all takes money which takes having a job and I don't have that. I feel frustrated because I have worked for 5 years to be able to graduate and find a good job. I feel like I am so confused and lost in my own life. I just have to keep reminding myself to be positive...maybe in this next batch of job apps I send out I will get lucky with something.   The other thing I think about is why I don't have a boyfriend. I wish so badly I had someone to share my life with. I love having a companion who I can love and care for. I wonder if it's somethign about me. Am I unloveable?? I try and be a kind caring person who thinks of other people before my self. Once again I just keep telling myself I have to be positive. Get negative isn't going to help me at all and I have to be patient. I think I am still in love with the other guy I have written about many times before. It's impossible to fall out of love in 2 or 3 months. I just can't do it.

      My dad and I always seem to come up with these crazy off the wall ideas and we get into it wall over our heads. Once again I think we have found ourselves in this situation. We have always wanted a water feature. Usually when we talk about it we are talking about having something in our backyard with a nice little fountain. Well my mom has shot down that idea so many times we came up with a better idea. We have this very large wall right inside our front door. We just moved into the house so it is still blank because we don't know what we want there. Well we decided we want a water feature there. Like one of those where water nicely trickles down a hanging wall fixture. So we did some research and found that they were going to cost about $4,000. Not necessarily in the budget. So then we get this great idea....we can build it...not a problem...we are smart, inventive, resourceful....so $300 later we have all the necessary pieces to make our own water feature (or so we think). My mom knows not to even get involved because we are focused and have a plan. I just am laughing. I can't believe we are building a water feature in our living room. Hopefully it works...if not we may have a $300 dollar wall hanging that doesn't do anything. :-) I will keep you posted.

      Well unfortunately it's been a week or so sense I've written. I've been up in I.F. hanging out and doing a little bit of odds and ends work. So to say the least life has been a bit boring and un-interesting.   Altho in the past week or so I have come up with some interesting thoughts....  1. I've already know that I absolutely love to party, drink, hang out. Part of the reason is that I like who I become when I am drunk. I become a different more exciting person. I become more outgoing and the life of the party. I love to mingle and just see everyone have a great time. I feel like when I go out I can't be like that social drinker. I am not happy and can't control just having one or two drinks when we go out. I have to have 15, I have to be drunk. I'm not an alcoholic or anything...I just know that I have an addictive personality when it comes to thinks like that. Something I'll have to watch....  2. I am absolutly, positively in love. The same guy I've written about before. It's like I love him so much I'm wondering if the best thing for him right now would be to walk away and let him go. Not stop  loving him but just let him try and figure things out without me yet still know that I love him. I am hoping to talk to him about it tonight...but we'll see. I miss him...he's my hero.  3. I really don't know what I am doing with my life and I am just getting more depressed the longer I don't know. THis is like the first time in my life I am this clueless about what I will be doing in a month, a year, etc. It is really scary. I have a lot of options just don't know what to do...so needless to say I'm not doing anything. But I guess I just need to patient and just really enjoy this time in my life and not rush it. It's hard to do but yet I need to do this.  4. Sometimes I get so bothered by things. Like for example I have made the decision that I am not going to have sex until I am with the right person and we are going to spend the rest of our lives together or until my wedding night. It's a decision I want to make with my future partner. Sometimes I get so frustrated because I see people around me with not the same opion or feeling on the subject. Which is fine and sometimes I wish I hadn't felt this way for so long. SOmetimes I think it would be a hell of a lot easier if I had decided to just sleep with someone a long time ago. I think it would feel like 1,000 pounds lifted off of my shoulders. It's not like I'm not glad I will be able to give my future husband something so special that no one else has gotten, I just hope he is able to give me the same things back. But I've think I've come to the conclusion if he can't over time I will be ok with it. I mean I am sure I will have some hard feelings about it, but I know that this is somethign I NEED to do for him. I figure if I am not willing to wait 23 years to have sex when I will be able to have sex all I want for the rest of my life once I am married. Seriously how hard is that to do, it should be no problem if I really want to love my future husband.  Anyways..this getting to be a long drawn out post....I will write more later.

      Well today has been the typical frustrating day so far. We were suppose to start framing and wiring out the basement today but of course my dad has been procrastinating all day. The only reason he is doing this is because he knows I wanted to leave town on Wednesday but I can't leave till the basement is done. ARGGGG. I am so ready to get a job and find my own place to live again. It's such a challenge to move back to my parents house in a town I have never been to before after being on my own for 5 years. Why does this have to happen to me. It seems like I have worked so hard for so long to achieve wealth and independence and somehow it was all ripped right out from under me. Why....did I do something to deserve this. I'm hoping by September I am settled somewhere else. I really want to go back home to Michigan. I REALLY REALLY want too. I miss home, I miss my unlce, I miss so much. All of my faviorate places are in Michigan. The sand dunes in Travers City, Machinaw City (enough said) it so beautiful there, all of the great lakes could you ask for anything more beautiful. Maybe if I get to move back there I will meet my man in shining armor. :-) Hey I can hope.  It seems like the last two years have just been filled with boy drama here. Maybe it's something in the water in Minnesota.....yeah that's got to be it. The one guy I fell in love with and wanted to marry....well let's just it didn't work out. We still talk about it and both are deeply in love but there is somethigns in the way. Who knows tho...maybe it will happen. I know the first time we decided we couldn't be together he was bawling and I was bawling and that is the first time my heart felt like it had been ripped out of my chest and steped on. I cried for weeks. I felt like my heart was just starting to heal when he came back into my life 2 months later. Again everything came rushing right back. We are ment to be together. There is simply no option. But again it ended in complete heart ache again for both of us. This time I am sitll not completely over him. My heart still hurts when I think about him and I still want to feel his arms around me. We still talk often and we are both still in love. I guess it's just not the right time for either of us. I know and we both keep telling outselves that if we are suppose to be together everythign will work out. Maybe were not ready..maybe it's going to be ina couple years. Who knows. I know I just have trust and believe that whatever is suppose to happen with happen. I just have to trust. Anyways...this post was just suppose to be short and a quick update but of course it ended up in a long drawn out variety of topics. Oh well....got to love variety.

      I sit here and think back to how I ever got to where I am now. Two months ago I was still at school living up life like a rock star. I was out getting drunk at least 4 times a week and loving every minute of it. Wake up the next moring go to a couple classes and do it all over again. Now two months later I am broke, jobless, and living at my parents in a town I know no one. How did this all happen. And to top it all off I am taking care of my parents. When I ask, when did my parents seem to get so sick. My mom's always been sick with her krohns disease but it's been so under control until lately. But now my dad to. We've been everywhere from a brain tumer to MS with no answers in sight. And somehow at 23 years of old with no siblings I am faced with all of this and to figure out what is the best and how I am suppose to take care of them. Somehow I feel cheated, shortened of my innocence. Two months ago I was worried about what bar we were going to go out to that night and who was going to be there. And now, now I'm worried about how long my dad's going to be with us and should my mom really be eating the piece of meat or that lettuce.  I'm not complaining about my life, I have a great life. I'm just not sure how I got from one extreme to the other. Where did everything go, when did all this happen. I feel like I am in the middle of a night mare but not sure when it started and not sure when or if it will end. Then they all wonder why I am so stressed all the time....hmmm I wonder. No stress in my life...yeah right. Oh well....life will go on. I will wake up tomorrow and the next day and the next day....and it will continue to go.

      Well this is my first post. I have no idea what this site will become. It could be come a mixture of things: my venting, my thoughts, my dreams, my goals, and my ultimate confusion in life. Seeing how my life is changing so much I know that the atmosphere of this blog will also change with me. I hope this becomes a place I can let my heart out and not feel judges or harped apon.

      Well night one of the bender was a blast. The teas were awsome and 4 hours of eating nachos was the best. Also the cannon falls boys who go up there ever year are up there this weekend and they bring fun illegal fire works so we had so much fun and they were awsome. I also splurged and bought myself another Sha -Sha sweatshirt. I already have one but it's getting old so I thought I needed another one. :-) Plus anyone who is anyone up here has a Sha-Sha sweatshirt.   After our fill of nachos and chesse we decided to hit the state park for a midnight walk. We went and found our old high school stomping grounds. That is the first time I had been out there sense graduation night. We laid on the famous rock and chatted for a couple hours about everything and the shooting starts were out in full force. John (my old roommate of two years, and the one who is getting married) wanted to go skinning dipping so badly. We said we would only go if we went over to city beach, another local hang out. We have experiece about not being able to get out of the lake on the rock...it's really slimy and slippery. It's not a good situation.  After a fun night of memories and chatting we headed back into town to crash.   This whole time is really making me realize how much I miss living with John and hanging out with Katie and everyone from back at school. We were chatting about John and my relationship while we lived together. Everyone laughed at us because we were the best roommates ever. We never got into one fight or disagrement and always new what the other one was thinking. We could go days without seeing eachother and then we would go days without being seperated. We were laughing because the only time we ever had meaningful conversations is when we would come home from the bars trashed. I would sit on the the one counter proping myself up on the microwave sipping my water and john would sit on the other counter proped up on the fridge and we would chat about everythign for hours at a time. We never just talked about stuff that mattered unless we each had a shit load to drink. And we liked it that way and would never change it. Then we would always wake up the next mornign and I would stumble down the stairs and he would stumble out of his room and we would laugh about out drunken chats.   It's so hard how things are constantly changing during these times of our lives. It's not a bad thing and I welcome these changes with open arms but it is just so difficult. As soon as I get comfortable with how things are and so happy with everything that is going on somethign drastic has to change. It's just so weird. I am looking forward to what will come up next, altho I will still miss my times with my friends from college and I hope someday I will meet friends again who are half as great as my friends from college are.   Another thing that I will have to keep everyone posted on is I found out last night I am walking up the aisle for this wedding with my ex-boyfriend who happens to be John's cousin. So that will be interesting. I haven't seen or talked to him sense we broke up and it's wasn't a bad break up....I just hope it's not akward. Oh well...we will have fun no matter what.  Hope this is a good weekend:-)

      Well just want to let everyone know I may not be posting for a couple of days. I will try but no promises, I am headed up north for a three day bender...oh baby!! Getting drunk and making out with random boys...what's better than that. :-) I am really looking forward to seeing alot of my friends from school that I haven't seen in 3 months. Oh how I miss my buddies. I am actually headed up there for one of my best friends wedding that I am standing in. But you know how us northern folks love to party it up. We don't even need an excuse to bring out the booze so a wedding just gives added energy. :-)  I am headed up there tomorrow morning around 11. Then we are going to the world famous Sha-sha resort. They have the best long island teas ever.......and the best nachos...everything else sucks but those two things make the whole experience worth it.  Well I will try and type some more tonight sense there is so much happening in my head but I'm not sure I will get to it.

      I try so hard to think the best about people. I always want to give people the benefit of the doubt. In a bad way sometimes I even try to continue to give people the benefit when all the facts say otherwise. As a friend I always want to be there for my friends in any way I can be. Whether that be emotionaly, financialy, absolutely anything I can do. Even my not so great friends...dare I say the word enemies I still try and do all these things for. Basically for a couple reasons 1. because that the way my parents are and that's the way I have been taught and 2. I hoep that the road goes both ways, not that it has to...but there are times when I just need a shoulder to cry on.  With all of this beign said I am feeling so used. I have had probably one of the worst 8 months of my life. Some reasons which I have tlaked about before.....my mothers and fathers health has not been the best and has given me a lot more responsiblities as the only child, not having a job, etc. Anyways...not that I am complaining about any of this..because I'm not. I try and take what cards life has handed me with a smile on my face, but I will addmitt it's tough. I'm 23 I don't know how to deal with any of this. Anyways I'm getting of track here....I guess sometimes I just wish I had friends who at least tried to be there for me once in a while. I feel like 90% of my friends the road only goes one way. I am sure they don't mean any of this...actually I know they don't...they are great people. I'm sure they just get wrapped up in their lives and before you know days and weeks have gone by sense anyone has asked me "how are you doing?" Which is fine but sometimes I just need someone to show a little compasions. It's kind of funny because I can tell when a lot of my friends are having good days or weeks because I don't hear from them...no returned e-mails, phone calls and definately not phone calls or e-mails coming from them without me sending one first. But then on the same note I can tell when life maybe not be going according to plan. Phoen calls are returned in a heart beat or they are calling me because they need to chat or they need a break. Which I struggle with feeling like I am complaining...which please believe me I am not. I want to be there for my friends in anyway I can be an dfor me that best way is to just listen. But sometime, just once in a while I would like someone to take my feelings into consideration.  I keep telling myself it's not a big deal, it's fine....but sometimes it's so hard. And it's not liek this is just a 2 or 3 month thing...this has been going on for 2 or 3 years. I don't knwo maybe I am expecting to much.....I know everyone is busy and that is good. I am happy for them.....I want to see everyone happy and successful.

      Well I had the interview this morning and it seemed to go well. They are suppose to let me know what's happening by the end of this week or early next week. I don't really know how I feel or not.....I'm just trying to let whatever suppose to happen happen. I also sent out my grad school apps. So hopefully something works out. I feel beter because I have at least stuff out there and happening. Now I just have to be patient. That's what sucks.

      Well after struggling for two months to figure out what I want to do and sending out tons, tons of resumes I finaly have a bite. Lets all keep our fingers crossed. I have an interview at 11:00 tomorrow morning. I am hoping, but not counting on it. Of course the job isn't 100% what I want but there is room for growth and hopefully will give me experience that is neccessary to reaching my goals. Well I will keep everyone updated as to what is happening.

      Well I now know where I get my complete and utter dorkiness from. My Dad is the biggest dork EVER. He makes me laugh so hard. I love him. He's the best.  Today I have been contimplating my life right now and my summer. I have been depressed because I have felt like this summer has been a complete waist. This is the first time in probably 7 years that I haven't had a job and not making money. I really wish I could find a job, aren't you suppose to be workign and making lots of money after you graduate from college.....Anyways I have really come to terms with not working this summer and I believe more good has come out of me not working then any  money I could have made would have done. I have decided that these last two months have been so good for my dad and I. In the last two months him and I have more memories together then we have had in my 23 years of life. I respect and love my dad with my whole heart. Even tho I don't agree with all of the decisions he has made while I was growing up....I do respect them and know that he made the best decision he know how at the time. I think in in the last two months we have spent more time together then in 23 years. I love it. It has been so much fun. We have laughed, cried, and had a blast. After much thinking I would not change this summer for anything.   Granted I hope I get a job soon....but I have enjoyed every minute with my dad. :-)

      Am I wrong in saying that if a person really wants to be with me and says he loves me with his whole heart and wants to marry me, but wont take a risk that we weren't meant to be together. I think I am worth a risk. Am I not?? I feel that when you find someone you want to marry you will do anything for them and no risk is to great, that no ledge is to big because you have no fear that that person you are going to marry will be there for you. Am I wrong in thinking that??   This is deffinately going to need some great thinking......

      I've been thinking lately how much I miss being in the computer lab. I know that sounds silly but really. We used to have so much fun in the lab. We would sing, dance, play music really loud (so again rules), eat (again against rules) that was totally our home away from home. We all had so much fun in there. And every day it was the same people working. We bonded in there. Hell I even got drunk in there once. Imagine what you can put in a Nalgine bottle. :-) I wasn't the only one...there was a whole shit load of us. I always said I do my best work with a little in me. :-)  I miss the lab.......

      Today I was walking into my bedroom (the office) and I walked by my one plant that I have. When I got this plant it was DEAD. We all thought there was no life left in it. We thought it was useless. But against everyones advice I took the plant from some of my friends and gave it a new home. I watered it, feed it , gave it sun and just in general loved it. Now as I look at it it has flurished into something absolutely beautiful. It has green leaves all over it and is just full of life. It is almost so big it is ready to replanted. It is beautiful.  It is a amazing what some TLC (Tender, love, and care) will do.   Now if a plant will do that with some TLC, I can only imagine what us as humans would do.  Interesting......

      It's been another non eventful day. What joy. I really want to get a job soon!!! Woke up about 12:00 still completely asleep but my dad was getting up so I had to as well. Went to lunch with pa and came back home. Just got done working on the basement some more. All the walls are done and up and ready for wiring tomorrow. It will probably take about two days to do all the wiring. Fun, Fun.  Hopefully this evening will be a little better. I'm sure it will be filled with mindless staring at the tv and chatting on the internet.   How has my life come to this....how.....

      Well I do believe confusion has offically set in. I feel like it is running my life in ever aspect. I have no job and am so confused as to where I want to head with my life and which direction that I just don't even know where to keep applying. My dream is to move to either the Chicago area or to the Michigan area. But at the same time i am ok with being in the Minnesota area as well. It's just so hard from me to know what to do.   The other aspect is the boy aspect. Everything is just so confusing to me. I am in love with someone I can't be with. I want to be with him more then anything. Every breath I take I long to be with him and have his arms around me, but at the same time I have another guy falling for me very quickly. He is a very nice guy and I am just trying to give everything time. I feel like I have met my true, one and only love. We have talked about wedding plans, where we would live, what kind of animals we would have everything. I want to be with him and he wants to be with me....but we can't. I feel like I have went through the dating process as much as I want to. I met my man. He knows what makes me tick, who I am, and where my heart is. He knows more about me then I probably know about myself. I don't want to go through that again. He does the small things for me too....gives me a good by hug and kiss, puts his hand in the small of my back as I walk by, rests his hand in my leg when we are near eachother, opens doors for me.....it's not fair that we can't be together. He wants it and so do I. Life handed us a shity deck of cards.  It's amazing how one choice, one decision, one day can change so many peoples lives. Not only does it change the decision makers life but it also changes many people around that persons lives. My life will be changed and so will his for the rest of our lives because of one decision he made. A decision he absolutely did not want to do but was to scared to change it at the time and now he things it is unreversable. I don't agree. I believe he can change it is he wants to bad enough. My only concern is he is feeding me lines that he may be feeding someone else as well. I have no reason to not trust him. i trust him with my whole heart wide open, but it makes me question things. If he truely feels the way he says he feels towards me then why are we so far apart.  I know that no matter what happens things will work out. If I  end up with im or not I will still be happy and still learn from this situation. I will be happy no matter what. I will never forget everything we had/have but it may change. My heart may get tired of hurting and find someone who will not hurt it anymore. He will always be my first love, but if things don't change from the way they are he may not be my only love.  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.      1 Corinthians 13:4-9

      I ask myself when, when is enough. When can I say enough is enough. Can I ever say that. Will I ever be able to let me heart go. Take my heart out of the hands of it's beholder. I don't know if I will ever be able too. I want to...I want to be able to move on. I want to be able to love someone else. I feel so much pain inside. I keep tellign myself that i need to grow from this experience and learn from it...but it's so hard. It's so hard to know when enough is enough.  I get so frustrated....he says over and over again how much he loves me and wants to be with me...yet he isn't. I feel like he isn't man enough to stand up and say...I made a mistake....if you make a mistake then you frikin fix it....end of story. I'm not mad about it any more...I am just so frustrated and sad. My heart is so broken and I know that the only person I want to be with I can't do anything about it.  I feel so helpless and sad.
