       I received an email a few days ago from someone that I socialized with during the last school year. I wouldn't call her a friend, since I'd only known her since perhaps October, but I have to be fair and say that we had gotten quite close given the short amount of time, at least close enough that when things started to go sour, I started to get very upset. I don't want to bother to recount the entire incident; suffice there was a supposed reconciliation, only for her to revert back to the habits that I had originally found aggravating, at which point I decided that it was best for me not to speak to her at all. This email that I recently received was an apology, however I can't help but be skeptical of her intentions. Her past apologies were always accompained by a caveat: "I'm sorry, but...", which to me, completely invalidates the apology.       There's another reason for me not to speak to her, that she is associated now with a former friend of mine, a person who was once one of my closest of friends, or so I thought. They had met through me, online, after he left comments on her weblog after having tracked her through comments she left on my weblog. After he had left a few comments, she asked me if it was alright to start up a dialogue with him, to which I replied "what do you need my permission for?" I assumed that my friendship with him would go unaltered regardless of whatever connection he had with her. However, during what would turn out to be the last time I would see my old friends from high school, this friend of mine spoke about a conversation he had with his new online friend, and how she had spoke disparagingly about me, since at this point, I had cut ties with her. He revealed that in the face of the allegations, he had said nothing in my defense. Although I said "you didn't have to say anything", I was actually crushed. He had known her for perhaps two or three months at that point, if that, while he and I had been friends for more than a decade. That I didn't rate even a "aww, he's not that bad" was devastating to me.       I can't help but recall the instances when I would defend my former friend againt insult, regardless of whether he was there to witness it.      It bothers me deeply that I was so easily betrayed, and I can't help but wonder if he might have acted differently had She been a He instead.

      My sister is what many would call a "cool" person.  She's got lots of friends, she goes to clubs, she wears clothes that are fashionable without being derivative, and she knows all the best places to eat.  It's not really much of a surprise that she's the kind of person that people tend to gravitate to, while I'm more the kind of person that ought to be enlisted into performing presidential assassinations on account of my ability to go completely unnoticed (not always by choice, mind you).  Yeah, she's a really cool girl, but as she gets older, it seems that the kinks in her trendy facade are becoming more and more apparent.  My sister's recent visit really cast a spotlight on a lot of the things that, in order to be popular, my sister has had to compromise on.    Her stay was meant to be one month in length, during which my mother really hoped to have the family spend time together, something that was a rarity even when my sister was in the country.  However, due partly to my schedule, but even more so to my sister's unwillingness to sacrifice any part of her social agenda, we did not even spend one single day, not eight consecutive hours, together as a family.  Rather, she'd go out to meet friends, go shopping, and she went to Montreal and New York.  Not that I'd begrudge her a good time, but my parents, they're not young, and I know once they're gone, she'll regret not having spent more time with them.  In fact, I know that she knows that she will have these regrets, yet the lure of the social butterfly is too overwhelming for her.  My mother asked my sister to join her, my father, and myself on a trip to Niagara Falls, but my sister was too tired from having gone out the night before, and she had made plans for later that day.  Whatever plans she had made, they surely could not amount to what she had missed.  When the Maid of the Mist sailed into the spray of the Falls, the expression on my mother's face, the joy that shone from her beaming smile, is one that I will never forget, and so powerful an image that the picture I took of it pales in comparison to the memory I have.    When my parents have passed, I wonder what regrets my sister will confide in me, and I know as I listen, I will wonder how much of her grief could have been avoided had she not been so selfish.

      A few days ago, I was watching  urlLink Spider Robinson  on television speak about the role of the science fiction writer, to infuse scientific issues with a perspective that may not have occurred to the scientific community, media, or masses.  In particular, he spoke about how cynicism and pessimism seems to have become the hallmark of sophistication, and optimism, in people, in life, in the future, is viewed as being unfashionable.  It's one of the things that really makes me furious, listening to people flaunt their cynicism, because they think that the dark perspective they possess, the more thought it will appear they have given to an issue.  It makes me angry because most of the people I know who act in this manner really don't have any business acting like the world is out to get them.  One lady who works with me, grossly overweight, makes a hobby of dispensing opinions laced with pessimism, while wearing a sour sneer to match.  I mention that she's grossly overweight only because that's the only thing, of what I know about her, that she could possibly complain about.  She got a decent job, and family, and clearly has food.  There are people in the world with much less.  It seems to me that it's often the people with the least excuse to be cynical that often are, while those who should be usually aren't.

      I have a confession to make.  Ready?  Here goes...  ... ... ...  I want Gmail.  Oh yeah, I want it bad.  In fact, I want it so bad I went and set up this Blogger account because I heard that Blogger members are sometimes offered Gmail invites.  I've got a  urlLink dotMac  account that is less than a month away from expiring, and I really don't feel like surrendering another $100 US for email and some remote disk space.  That, and Gmail's 1 GB storage limit makes my knees weak.  Oh baby :P

      Last week, a Japanese guy I met in language exchange asked for my email, to arrange a meeting, so that we could meet for extra practice with our respective languages of study.  The  urlLink JCSA , the group that organizes the language exchanges, has a rule that emails and phone numbers are not to be requested or exchanged during the time that the language exchange is in progress.  The reason for this is (supposedly) because at some point, English-speaking guys got the idea that the JCSA was some kind of repository for lonely Japanese girls.  This rule has farther reaching implications, as I discovered.  When this guy asked for my email, I gave it to him, and I would have whether he had asked within or outside of the language exchange.  But what occured to me is that there was no possible way in which I could have politely withheld my email from him had I wanted to.  How do you say "sorry, but I don't feel comfortable with you having my email" without offending someone?  Therefore the JCSA asks that you don't put anyone in that position by simply not asking within the time that the language exchange is in session.    Anyway, today I met with the guy, and actually, it wasn't that bad an experience.  For the most part, I explained the differences between affirmatives, like "sure thing", "I'm game", "why not?", and so on, as well as the meaning of a few common idioms.  I didn't mind the experience, and I didn't feel on my best game, Japanese-wise, so I didn't really feel like speaking anything but English, but all the while, I couldn't help but notice a slight shift in mannerisms from when the guy had asked for my email.  As best as I can describe it, it felt like it was the difference between someone asking for something they want, and someone who had alrady gotten what they want.  Of course, he had just come from class, so perhaps he was just tired, which would explain the somewhat less chummy vibe I was picking up.  It made me recall what one of my Japanese TAs from last year told me, about how Japanese people would just walk up to him and expect an impromptu English lesson (presumably) because he was a typical blond-haired, blue-eyed foreigner.  I couldn't help but also remember having read stories about English-speakers having been befriended by Japanese, only to discover that 友達 might better be translated as "free English-tutor" rather than "friend".  If that's that case, so long as he's willing to reciprocate and help me with my Japanese, and he recognizes that once the school year kicks off, that my studies come first, I don't much mind this arrangement.  Actually, I wouldn't mind giving the free English lessons either, if I knew that we wanted to be my friend first and foremost, however, it's probably safer to assume otherwise for now.  On an unrelated note, I noticed that recently the counter for this weblog has passed the 200 hit mark, with most of the people being...Windows XP users?  Bizarre.  Anyway, I figure since I'm not being inundated with email or comment flames, that people are at least marginally interested, so thanks for reading.

      The past couple days, I've been sleeping downstairs on the first floor where it's cooler, rather than in my room on the third floor, where it's like a sauna and pressure cooker all in one, so it's been a while since I've spent a lot of time in my room.  I came up here tonight to get some studying done, and I'm facing the wall where I stuck the Post-it notes with my schedule for this September.  It turns out that the scheduling mistake I referred to in my last entry was not entirely mine.  The course calender did indeed list "Modern Approaches to East Asian History" as being in a time slot that wouldn't conflict with "Fundamentals of Japanese Grammar", but somewhere along they line they must have changed the time slot.  I'm sure I received some notices of timetable changes; I seem to remember having received some kind of missive in the mail, and the cursory skim read I gave it was insufficient to notice the change in time.

      I swear I checked.  In each course calendar, there were two double-sided blank weekly calendars for drafting prospective course schedules.  I used at least six pages.  Then, a week before enrollment, I wrote the names, times, course codes, and registration information of each of the courses I wanted to take on Post-it notes, then stuck them to my wall in timetable order.    Yesterday, my supervisor asked me what my schedule for the school year would look like, so that he could assign me hours.  At the time, I only had a vague idea, so I told him I'd check and get back to him.  Today, I checked my timetable, only to discover a timetable conflict.  (insert loud profanity here)  It's quite a big deal to me, since it appears I'm one of a rare breed of university students that enjoys university for the education.  However, there's still a bit of a juggling act to be done.  Some courses are less of a joy to partake in than others, but I have to take them to finish my degree.  In this case, I'm stuck between a Group II course and a Group III course.  U of T's East Asian department categorizes courses into three groups: Group I language courses (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and sometimes Vietnamese), Group II "core" courses (history, politics, and religion), and Group III specialized courses (what makes them different from Group II courses escapes me for the moment).  In addition to a reasonable level of proficiency in at least one East Asian language, my degree requires that I take a certain number of Group II courses, which make of the bulk of my degree.  Group III courses carry considerably less value, so I'm only permitted to take a certain number that will count toward my degree.  The two courses that conflict are a full-year Group II course and a half year Group III course.  The full-year course is "approaches to Modern East Asian History", and the half-year course is "Fundamentals of Japanese Grammar".  The former is more important in terms of completing my degree, but also more important in terms of learning what the course has to offer, so that upon graduation, I don't find myself a "paper tiger", so to speak.  The latter course holds more interest to me, but is clearly less important both in terms of accomplishing my degree and the importance of the content, since I'm taking the core second-year Japanese language course and (hopefully) I'll be going to Japan for my third year, where I'll probably O.D. on Japanese copulas and auxiliaries.  It's an easy choice, in terms of what I have to do, although I'll drop the grammar course grudgingly.  There's no question in my mind that it's the right choice to make; it's just not the fun one.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to replace the half-credit with something else, since the selection of East Asian courses provided slim pickings to start with.  By the way, the 1st annual timetable screw-up had me registering for a dental anthropology course instead of the pop culture course I had intended to take.  You can imagine my surprise when I walked in (late) to the first class, and then my embarrassment as I announced I was in the wrong class and excused myself :P

      This Thursday will be my last class with my summer Japanese teacher, so I'll have three or so weeks without any school whatsoever.  I feel it's important that I train myself for the school year by doing "practice" study days.  It sounds kind of strange, perhaps a little excessive, certainly very geeky, but the fact of the matter is that I know my nature very well at this point, or at least I know how a little vigilance can go a long way towards preventing myself from falling down that slippery slope right back into the waiting arms of old, bad habits.  It's like a slasher flick, where the murderer always seems to be just a breath's reach away.    I've got some books that I can read, so I can get used to extended reading sessions again, and I'll start reviewing all the Japanese vocabulary from last year (grammar's more or less okay, since I've been using it all summer), and continue to try to get ahead in this coming year's textbook.  I want to be in a competitive condition right from the start of the school year, instead of having to warm up over the first few weeks.  I allowed myself guilty pleasure of a few hours of video game play over the past week, but it's only served to illustrate how easy it is for one of my own vices to enrapture and snare me all over again.  The best thing for me, I think, would be to sell of my video games and related equipment, but I can't help but cling to them, telling myself that the last game I'll ever is just at the horizon, and once I've finished it, my gaming career will be over.  I remember using a similar rationalization to justify the multiple "last" cigarettes I would smoke.  I hope Jet Li's upcoming film,  urlLink Danny the Dog  is the kind of hit that Jet Li deserves.  Say what you will about the man's acting chops (or lack thereof), but the man has more martial arts talent in his toe nail clippings than the rest of the world combined.  And  who are you to criticize anyway?  Can you do an inside jump kick-butterfly twist-aerial-into-front sweep combination?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  Anyway, this seems like the kind of role he's suited for, and he's got two strong co-stars, Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins.

      I come up with entry titles after I compose the actual entry, otherwise I'd have tried to make the transition from subject to subject much more seamless.  The plan was to go to  urlLink Spring Roll  and then head over to a showing of  urlLink Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle .  Unfortunately one of the members of this outing's trio had to return home earlier, since the public transit available to her area was scheduled to close early in the evening, and she would be stranded downtown.  We went to Spring Roll, however, where the food is always really good, and I had salmon drenched in some kind of peanut sauce with coconut sticky rice, while sharing some sake with my friends.  It's probably a good thing we skipped the movie, because as soon as I got home, around 7:30 PM or so, I crawled onto my father's acupuncture treatment table and slept like the dead.  I recall having a vivid dream, the kind that you wake up believing you are still it, but it has since faded, and all that remains is the memory of having experienced the dream.    It was nice to spend time with people that I don't usually get to see under normal circumstances.  In one case, because I no longer go to my former wushu club, I don't get to see one friend as often as I would like any longer.  The other person is my co-worker, one of the few that I socialize with at work.  Despite being tired, since two of us had worked 8 hours and the other 5 hours prior to going out, I think it's safe to say we all had a good time.  School is now but a month away.  I look forward to it, but there's a bit of anxiety growing.  My schedule is set up such that fitting in shifts at work will be difficult.  I'll be starting the Korean language in September, something of a crucible for me, since my two previous attempts have been absolutely unsuccessful, in addition to all the emotional baggage I attach to the language.  There's an expectation for me to succeed, not because of any innate talent, but simply because I was born to Korean parents.  Were I able to speak Korean fluently, I would not have had to endure being labelled "white-washed" or "banana".  In some ways, it feels like I'm selling myself out, since I shouldn't care what other people think.  But it's hard not to care.  Earlier this year, someone, having found out that I don't speak Korean, said that I take East Asian Studies only so that I can feel that I can feel I have a right to my heritage.  When people criticize you for not being able to speak your parent's language and as a result condemn you for supposedly moving away from their culture, it's a criticism aimed at your very identity.  It declares that as you are, whatever kind of person you are, you'll never be complete or good enough without being able to speak your parent's language.  Moreover, this kind of thinking suggests that no matter what you try to become, you can never escape the bonds of ethnicity.  It's emotionally exhausting and often painful.  Aside from Korean, my courses include second-year Japanese, which I was very fortunate to get into (thanks!), a Japanese grammar course, Approaches to Modern East Asian History, and a course on Japanese and Korean Religion.

      My cousin, my friend and I went to the  urlLink Taste of the Danforth  earlier this (Friday) evening.  The Taste of the Danforth is a street festival, where traffic is cut off over a number of blocks, and for the weekend, pedestrians can traverse along the street sampling a bevy of food from various restaurants, mostly Greek, since the Danforth is a Greek area.  Although I've lived in Toronto all my life, I hadn't ever gone to the festival until this year, mostly because it was yet another event that, as a Toronto-native, I took for granted.  To be honest, it wasn't fantastic, but it was worth going to, if only because the food was good and cheap, and there were a number of companies giving out freebies.  I suspect that it will become more lively as the weekend progresses, as we arrived around 6 PM, when the festival was scheduled to begin.    I didn't take pictures, since there really wasn't anything very unique to take pictures of.  Another event I plan to take part in is the annual  urlLink C.N. Tower Climb .  A friend who has participated in the past was able to finish his climb in approximately 15 minutes, a period that I can't seem to reconcile with the height of the structure.  I wonder how I will fare?  I look forward to the challenge of it, but also the experience, and the ability to say that "I've done it" that will accompany it.  At the end of this month, Star Trek: The Next Generation's  urlLink  Patrick Stewart  is coming to Toronto for the  urlLink Canadian National Science Fiction Expo .  I'd really like to listen to the man speak, but the ticket costs $120 Canadian, and that's not including the price of the ticket ot actually get into the convention.

          I received an order confirmation email from the company I've ordered my new sword from. They're experiencing a shortage of raw wood, necessary to produce the scabbord for my sword, so they've asked that I be patient and wait six to eight weeks. I think they mean six to eight weeks for them to make the sword, in addition to however long it takes for it to get to my doorstep. I always find myself getting twitchy when waiting for parcels in the mail, and once the shorter arrival estimate passes, I feel that a grave injustice has been cast upon me, much like a person whose pizza is past due the guaranteed 30 minute delivery period. I'm trying to brace myself for the longer eight week period. In fact, I put a countdown on the sidebar, under my profile :P Really, I just felt like adding something, and I didn't have any real content to speak of.  I've also discovered that photos can in fact be posted on Blogger weblogs! The system is not Blogger-native though, which is to say that I have another web-based service that works in tandem with Blogger. I'm unsure about how to use it, so here's my first test photo. It's a picture of the University of Toronto campus along King's College Road, facing University College. U or T really is a beautiful campus, but having lived in Toronto all my life, and now working on campus in addition to going to school there, it's easy to forget that fact. U of T's campus is integrated into the city of Toronto as well, so it's even easier still. I took this picture on a Friday in late June or early July, before a friend and I went to the Royal Ontario Museum.

      As I am still not entirely pleased yet with the layout of my webpage, I've added a few things to the left hand sidebar.  One change is that there is that I've put up a fuller profile of myself.  It occurred to me while browsing through other people's weblogs, that it's hard to get a sense of where the author is coming from without knowing even some basic information about them.  I don't expect an autobiography, but knowing things like what area of the world they're in or what kind of job they have helps to place entries in some kind of context.  I've also blatently ripped off  urlLink former Star Trek: The Next Generation actor Wil Wheaton's weblog 's sidebar current interests list, so that you can see what I'm up to, though I can't really imagine why you'd be interested :P  Following my overly verbose links section, you'll find a  urlLink Creative Commons  license.  I debated whether it was worth squeezing it in between the Blogger station identification and hit counter, but ultimately I decided that I ought to.  On the one hand, I thought to myself "what, you think your entries are so wonderful that people are going to rip them off?", and on the other...well, I really hate it when people do rip stuff off my pages without asking.  It happened a couple time before, usually with pictures, and in each instance, the person hadn't asked for permission to use the photos, nor had they bothered to save the photo to their own server; they just linked directly to my page.  I didn't find that very classy.    One last thing I'd like to do is get rid of is that advertisement at the top of my page.  Obviously that's something that won't happen so long as I'm on the Blogger system, so there may be one final move that will put this weblog on the  urlLink individual web space  that the  urlLink University of Toronto  provides to all their students.  It's only available to me so long as I'm a student, but seeing as how I've got three more years of undergraduate studies, possibly followed by graduate school, it's a pretty long term solution.    [addendum, 3:52PM]  One other change I've made is to switch my hit counter service to a move reputable provider and also happens to offer statistics as well as the basic counter, just for my own curiosity.  I've also moved the counter to the bottom of the page, since it's placement on the side bar looked messy, because it was centered instead of offset to the left.

      You may have noticed that a few days ago, I added a counter to the bottom of the left hand column.  I was just curious about how much traffic passes by my site.  I'm really surprised to see that in the span of a few short days, I've almost hit 100.  I'd say that about 15 or so of those hits are from me, though :P  I wonder how many people are arriving here by accident, or whether many people are bothering to stay a while?  I've also added links to the left hand column.  I wish I could say that there's something for everyone, but I chose only the sites that interest me the most of the links I visit on a daily, or almost, basis.  So maybe there isn't something for everyone, but I can provide some assurance of quality if you're interested in video games, comics, movies, martial arts, or Japan.  Unfortunately, there are space limitations, and I don't know how to make the text align on both the left and right side.  Text that isn't aligned on both sides bothers me; I don't like the jagged words on the right.  If you come across any links you thing I'd be interested in, please post it in the comments!

      I have a massive Word file on my hard drive.  It contains quotes that I come across while reading, surfing, watching television, and whatnot.  Maybe someone in addition to myself will find them interesting, uplifting, or thought-provoking.  "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is therefore not an act, but a habit." -Aristotle  "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." -Ronald E. Osborn  "Your profession is not what brings home your paycheck.  Your profession is what you were put on earth to do."-Vincent Van Gogh  These last ones I recently found in a book I'm reading,  urlLink By the Sword , written by Richard Cohen.  His words struck a chord with me, appealing to my sense of romance where swordplay is concerned.  He quotes John Keegan on swordsmen throughout the ages, "for whom fighting was an act of self-expression by which a man displayed not only his courage but also his individuality..." and writes about the history of swordsmanship, "at once graceful and brutish, fiercely competitive and technically beautiful, life-threatening and life-enhancing".

      I don't think it's unfair to say that Blogger's service is jsut about as good as Six Apart's Moveable Type based Typepad service, especially considering that I pay Blogger the bargain basement price of zero dollars.  There are a couple things I'd like to add, though.  First is a links page, since I've got this wacky notion that somebody out there wants to see what kind of web sites I frequently peruse.  Second is the ability to add photos to my posts.  There may already be a way to do this, but I can't seem to figure out how.  I think I had a "Third", but appears to have now evaded my grasp.  The last post I wrote regarding my sister painted her in a rather unflattering light.  Yeah, she can be really spoiled, but if that's the worst of her failings, it's really not that bad.  She knows that she's spoiled too, which puts her ahead of the pack, and her awareness of that aspect of her personality puts her in a good position to move past it, if she wanted to.  I should point out that I'm quite proud of my sister, the way she has dedicated herself these past years to becoming an excellent English teacher.  I've never sat in on her class, but I remember her going over ESL texts and trying to create lesson plans that were useful and fun.  Even though she's been unsure of what path to take in life, as I've watched the effort she has put into becoming a good teacher, I'm reminded of all the mediocre to poor educators I've had in the past, and I'm certain that if she choses to pursue a teaching career, that she will never be amongst those ranks.

      I've heard that you can tell a lot about a person by the state of their desk, in particular, whether they are organized or not.  Right now my desk is messy, and there's a lot of random flotsam drifting in my head as well.  School's only a month away, and I'm beginning to feel a bit worried, not about anything specific, but just the kind of obligatory anxiety that tends to accompany the start of a new school year.  I'd like to think that my last academic year wiped clean the slate of past academic failures, but I think I'd rather always have that stain hanging over me, close at hand and always in the corner of my mind, so that the fear of falling back into bad habits can keep me going, if I can't find better motivation at that moment.  I bought a new sword.  Six to eight weeks of waiting.  I hate the waiting most of all.  That, and the inevitable customs fees.  I decided not to get the one that appealed the most to me visually, since, after shipping, the cost of the sword and the apparel would have been close to $1000 Canadian.  Instead I decided on one that is more plain, but of equal quality, saving me around $300.  It seems that whatever problem Azusa's hard drive was having has gone away, and she is functioning as per normal.  Of all the cities in Japan, Kyoto is the one I would like to go to the most for exchange, however, the course selection at Tokyo University seems to be more in line with my interests, history and language, as opposed to Kyoto University's more business and political offerings.  Unfortunately, one of the requirements for Kyoto University's exchange scholarship is that the applicant cannot be under review for any other exchange scholarship, which means I can't apply to both.  For now, however, the course selection for Kyoto University has not been finalized, so it's not an issue yet.  I really like the dots on my weblog.  Don't you?  There's very trendy, yet also high tech in their own way.  I still don't have a Gmail account :(
