      It was only a matter of time before my plan to spend the afternoon in the Italian Market, drinking coffee and finishing  Getting Mother's Body ,   would be thwarted. But what would chase me home first? The rain (which I figured would come eventually) or the bad music (which was totally unexpected)?  I was sitting across the street from the little lot with the Frank Rizzo mural, where the banner reading "DiBruno Brothers Welcomes Rudy Giuliani, a Fine Italian-American" was still hanging. There was a little mini (very mini) festival--a jewelry table, the ASPCA, and a few tables of food. And then the band started. There are certain songs that some people just shouldn't sing. And this singer should not have sang "Work Song" ("breakin' up old rocks on the chain gang. . ."). It was painful. And, no, not painful in the way that the blues sometimes is. Painful like karaoke or Rod Stewart. I made it through the song even though I couldn't find even one kindred spirit to meet my scornful, anguished gaze.  That first song turned out to be the pinnacle of the awfulness, and the band then lapsed into the inoffensive mediocrity that you'd expect from middle-aged white guys playing bar music in the Italian Market. And the sax player, who had caught my ear while he was warming up, turned out to be the big dude with the beard and the one long dread hanging down his back. I feel like I've heard him play many times, but all I can specifically think of is that he plays with Calvin Weston's Big Tree (I heard them at Swarthmore, and they had a weekly gig at Tritone).  Anyway, he can play.  The rain came during the third or fourth song, and it was time to go. I got wet but not drenched, and it felt good. I don't remember the last time I really enjoyed a good rain.

      Listening to Sun Ra   Somewhere Else   . . .  Somewhere else.  Not "somethin" else.  Somewhere else.  He's got like a little mini percussion ensemble to work with underneath everything else.  And a bass duet.  And then the massive horn sections.  All together.  It's symphonic.   Other stuff with 2 basses . . .  Coltrane,   Ole Coltrane   (Reggie Workman & Art Davis just on "Ole" and "Dahomey Dance") Ornette Coleman,   Body Meta    Coltrane's   Ascension   and Ornette's   Free Jazz   also.  What else?  Miles electric stuff . . .   Bitches' Brew   (Dave Holland (usually upright) &amp; Harvey Brooks (electric)) . . . also   Big Fun  .  Maybe something on the Josh Roseman album,   Treats for the Nightwalker  ?  What else?

       Kirkatron , the album I'm listening to, is not one of Rahsaan's best albums, although "Serenade to a Cuckoo" and "Bagpipe Medley" are two wild little songs. And any Rahsaan album is certainly more than worth listening to.  If you're ready to be knocked down by Rahsaan's genius in one shot, go straight to  Natural Black Inventions: Root Strata . My progression went like this:   We Free Kings   Rip, Rig and Panic  (this and the next one are together on 1 disc)  Now please don't you cry, beautiful Edith   Dog Years in the Fourth Ring   Natural Black Inventions: Root Strata   A Standing Eight  (this is his last three albums,  The Return of the 5,000 Lb. Man ,  Kirkatron , and  Boogie-Woogie String Along For Real  all together on 2 discs)  As I said, the idea of any of Rahsaan's music being "bad" seems absurd. My favorites of the above are  We Free Kings ,  Rip, Rig and Panic , and  Natural Black Inventions . I'm just listening to all of  A Standing Eight  now.

      I was about to write some responses to what I wrote about Rahsaan.  But then "Bagpipe Medley" came on. Holy shit.   Okay. . . It's over.  The main potential problem I see with using Rahsaan as a unifying theme in the way I was thinking about is that it's very individualistic. It seems odd to celebrate one individual as a way of building a sense of community. That's a cult! Maybe it would be better to have a group of people as the opening theme.  I'm going to try to find out more about Rahsaan and the people around him, his childhood, etc. Maybe he can be celebrated in a less individual-focused, more community-centered way.  . . . After "Bagpipe Medley" was a recording of  urlLink Mary McLeod Bethune  speaking . . .   (. . . for more on Mary McLeod Bethune, check out  Let it Shine: Stories of Black Women Freedom Fighters  by Andrea Davis Pinckney)

      So how's this for an opening-of-the-year, classroom-culture-building, positive theme?   urlLink Rahsaan Roland Kirk  as a messenger of hope, of infinite possibility:  If Rahsaan could be, then anything is possible.  The power of human will.  He would become the class hero (hopefully the first of many), part of the family lore--the start of the family lore. Our shared appreciation and valuing of him would actually help create the whole notion of the class as a group, as a family.  . . . listening to "Serenade to a Cuckoo" from  Kirkatron  . . .

      Politics is never simple, so I feel compelled to write about Jim McGreevy again, if only so people don't think I'm not up on the whole story.  I won't go into it here, but basically it sounds like another case of an adulterous and corrupt politician.   But that's just one layer of it and not (as my father insisted in a heated debate with my mother and me) THE story.  As far as I'm concerned, the more interesting part of the story is the fact that a politician in a powerful, elected office came out.  I think it's pretty unprecedented.  Anyway, in spite of the corruption, one layer of the story is simply a man's struggle with his identity and the eloquent, sensitive way in which he described his struggle.  It's not an issue of defending McGreevy, it's just about understanding his situation on as many levels as possible.   Reality is complicated, layered,  and multifaceted, but not everybody sees the world this way.  Is this yet another Blue/Red difference?

      That's the Willie Nelson song that just ended. It's from  Crazy: The Demo Sessions . I bought this CD a bit after it came out, a few months ago. I listened to it over and over again the first couple of days, but barely at all since then. It's full of biting lyrics that just cut to the core, like   Yesterday as I talked with a friend in town I forgot to remember that you'd gone. For a moment I found myself smiling But a moment isn't very long.   . . .Oooh, now "Crazy" is on. . . . The album is all demos of songs Nelson wrote. They were recorded in the early 60s before he was famous (and when he had short hair and wore suits). A lot of the songs are just him and his acoustic. Some have small bands, with steel guitar, piano, and drums. I'm actually skipping most of the acoustic stuff now because they're so damn depressing, and I'm not in the mood for depressing music. I'm definitely in a steel guitar mood. I'm in a sort of heavy guitar, Western mood. I might listen to some Neil Young next, either  Sleeps with Angels  or  Broken Arrow . Then I'm going to watch a movie, either  The Searchers  or  Unforgiven .  Odds and ends. . .  (1) Anyone see the weird "Metro/Retro" ads in The Times today? The first one was a picture of Michael Moore in one corner of the page and Mel Gibson in the opposite corner. The Moore picture said "METRO" in big white letters and the Gibson picture said "RETRO." The only other text was this URL at the bottom of each picture:   urlLink http://retrovsmetro.org    The next one was a picture of windmills on p. A18 (Can you guess? It said "METRO.") Then on p. A20 were some oil wells (RETRO). The last one had two pictures, one on top of the other: Newt Gingrich and Hillary Clinton. Check out the site--don't get too excited, but it's worth looking at.  (2) Mee goreng noodles from Asia@Cafe at 8th and Washington are so so good. (I suggest getting them without the chicken and shrimp, just tofu.)  (3) I had a great fortune tonight:   You will soon be crossing the great waters.   I mean that's got some real heft to it, real drama. . . . We shall see. . .  . . . Neil Young just came on. . . "Big Time" . . .   Gonna leave the pain behind   Gonna leave the fools in line  Gonna take the magic potion  Gettin in an old black car  Gonna take a ride so far  To the land of suntan lotion   (4) Have you ever had a fresh fig? I had only ever had dried figs before, until a few days ago. They're wonderful!!! (Unfortunately, I think they're kind of like fresh apricots, in that maybe only 1 in 5 are actually good--but the good ones. . . damn!)

      I was just on the phone with my mom a little while ago, and she told me about the press conference she was watching. Jim McGreevy, the governor of New Jersey, just announced that he was gay, had had an affair with a man, and was resigning as governor. My mother was really taken with his speech, just very impressed with his courage, dignity, and eloquence. I just read the speech. My mother was right. Here's one of the more powerful parts of the speech--McGreevy describing how he "passed" as straight:     I forced what I thought was an acceptable reality onto myself, a reality which is layered and layered with all the, quote, good things, and all the, quote, right things of typical adolescent and adult behavior. Yet, at my most reflective, maybe even spiritual level, there were points in my life when I began to question what an acceptable reality really meant for me. Were there realities from which I was running? Which master was I trying to serve?    He said,           At a point in every person's life, one has to look deeply into the mirror of one's soul and decide one's unique truth in the world, not as we may want to see it or hope to see it, but as it is.  And so my truth is that I am a gay American.   I really think his words have resonance for all of us, and they definitely transcend the specifics of the issue at hand.   Go Jim. Go Mom.  Here's the full text of the speech:  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/12/nyregion/12TEXT-MCGR.html

      I came very very close to being picked for a jury today. It was very disappointing that I wasn't. I felt rejected.  The whole experience was a mixture of the goofiness that inevitably results when a large group of adults are forced into an unknown bureaucratic situation and a serious sense that we were performing a genuinely valuable (maybe even sacred) civic function. Yes, I recognize how ridiculous that last part sounds. And, no, I don't believe that that sentiment was shared by many of my peers.  After going through metal detectors just inside the Criminal Justice Center, I was led to a line of people waiting to get into the jury room. I signed in and was told to take 2 questionnaires to fill out. Altogether there were a couple hundred people in the room, sitting in chairs with fold-out desks, like in a college lecture hall. Eventually, the chipper lady who was in charge put on a video to help us answer the questions. On the video, a judge read and explained each of the 30 or so questions on the questionnaires (one for criminal cases and one for civil cases). A couple of times, a new judge came on, I guess for variety. We were then greeted by the Jury Commissioner and a judge ("one of the best we have," the chipper hostess said). We were led to believe that their presence was a special treat. The commissioner said, "Good morning!" and then repeated it with tone to indicate that he wanted a better response from us jurors--you know, the way a school principal does.  Eventually, jurors were called in groups of 40 or 60 to go to courtrooms. I was Juror #3 in the third group, a group of 40 that was to report to a courtroom in City Hall for a civil case. One of the highlights of the day was watching everybody line up in a double line ("Get a buddy," the chipper lady said.). One woman even asked the guy in front of me to switch with her so she could be with her friend. Then we walked,  in our lines , out of the building and across the street to City Hall. It was like a field trip!  After some confusion and a group of us waiting outside the wrong courtroom, we ended up in Courtroom 696. A short, older woman was in charge. There were lawyers moving around trying to look important, and there was much waiting. One of the plaintiff's lawyers finally addressed us and explained that the case involved a woman who had taken the diet drug Phen-Fen (is that how you spell it?). She was suing Wyeth, the large pharmaceutical company. The lawyer and his client were from Texas, but Wyeth is based in the Philly area. The woman had some sort of heart problem, specifically with her valves, I think. The lawyer asked us a series of questions. If our answer was yes, we had to raise our hand and say our juror number. He asked if we had ever worked for Wyeth or another pharmaceutical company. But he also asked more personal questions, like whether we had any heart problems and even if we had ever taken Phen-Fen. (I was very embarrassed, but I had to publicly admit that, yes, Phen-Fen is the reason I'm so skinny.) One of the opposing lawyers got up and asked his series of questions (including whether a corporation would start off at a disadvantage in our minds just because it was a large corporation--I didn't raise my hand). Then, after more waiting, we were called one-by-one into a room in the corner of the courtroom to be questioned further. It was pretty intimidating. There were 7 or 8 lawyers (from both sides), some sitting and some standing. The room was not large, so they were all pretty close to me. The old woman was there too, though, so I wasn't worried. I explained some of my answers on the questionnaire, telling them that my father was an attorney and formerly a prosecutor. I explained what kind of law my father practiced, and one of the lawyers asked me if anything he ever discussed with me had influenced my opinion about personal injury cases. I answered no. They also asked me where I teach and what grade. They didn't seem to have any problems with me, and I really thought that I'd be picked. I was definitely in the minority of people who hadn't answered yes to any of the questions they asked us as a group, so I thought I had a really good shot. (I imagine I was also one of the few people who actually wanted to get picked.)  Anyway, here's the climax (which, alas, is somewhat anticlimactic). The old woman announced the 10 chosen jurors by number and seated them in the jury box. I was not one of them. But then one of the lawyers asked her to announce the jurors' names. She said, "Juror #2 is Matthew Feldman." I got very excited and said, "I'm Matthew Feldman." I then asked very eagerly, "Am I Juror #2?" She said, "You were almost Juror #2." Apparently, she had been reading from an older list, which I guess means that I had been selected and then vetoed by one of the lawyers. So there you have it. Even the judicial system toys with my mind.  Other notes. . .  I ended up not even reading any of either of my books, just the newspaper.  The Times happened to have almost a full page's worth of puzzles today, on the Op-Ed page. I did some of them, but some things just didn't quite click.  In the courtroom, I was sitting next to a woman who's a Head Start teacher at the school where I taught summer school. I didn't know her, but we talked about the principal, the contract dispute, etc.  Sitting on the other side of me in the courtroom (and also sitting next to me in the Jury Room) was an interesting and talkative guy. We made wise-ass comments to each other about stuff going on and had a discussion about personal responsibility, corporate greed, and the legitimacy of personal injury cases. Later, when we were back in the Jury Room waiting for our $9 checks (yeah, that's right), we lamented the sinister presence of cheese curls and grape soda in the hands of ghetto children. That's just how the conversation started--actually, we had a good discussion about urban schools/parent ed./etc. I thought he was only a little older than me, but then he mentioned that he'd grown up in North Philly 30 years ago.

      I just watched  An American in Paris . As I sat down at the computer afterwards, I started mindlessly fiddling on my thumb piano and. . . out came the first four notes of "Our Love Is Here To Stay" ("It's ver-y clear"). I wasn't trying to play anything, but it just came out. Pretty neat, huh?  So, the movie. . . . I should first say that, for the most part, I don't really like musical movies. The exceptions are  Singin' in the Rain , which is one of my favorite movies of any kind, and  On the Town , which has great Leonard Bernstein music and is surprisingly clever and subversive. I was trying to think of other musicals I like. A couple recent ones-- Moulin Rouge  (I loved it the first several times I saw it, but I'm less into it now) and  Chicago  (it definitely did some fun new things). Anyway, both  Singin' in the Rain  and  On the Town  have Gene Kelly. He's in  An American in Paris , of course, and my father's told me, "If you like  Singin' in the Rain , you should see  An American in Paris ."  I enjoyed  An American in Paris , but I'll be fine if I don't see it again. I can appreciate the dancing and recognize the quality of (some of) the music, but that's about it.  Singin' in the Rain  and  On the Town  offer a lot more. It's not that they're deep or anything. But they actually work as films, as opposed to just scenes put together.  Some of the music and singing wasn't quite there either. The French guy who's supposed to marry Gene Kelly's girl is not pleasant to listen to or watch (maybe that's the point, but we still have to sit through it). And I have to say, it's hard for me to enjoy some of the Gershwin songs that jazz singers have recorded ("Our Love Is Here to Stay," "S'Wonderful"). I know these might even be the "original" versions, but once you've heard Ella Fitzgerald sing a song, there's not much use in listening to Gene Kelly do it.  This sounds very negative but, as I said, on the whole I did enjoy the movie. Maybe it's easier for me to criticize than to praise. There's also the fact that the very act of writing about something tends to shape my opinion of it. The process of writing becomes indistinguishable from the process of constructing an opinion.  (Was that last sentence hyper-intellectual nonsense?)  Thoughts during the movie. . . -Maybe I should be more like Gene Kelly--smooth, goofy, charming. . . -What does the prevalence of online socializing (IM, friendster, blogging, etc.) mean for the future of love at first sight? -Someone with strong homophobic feelings would not be able to watch this movie without--well, without expressing his homophobic feelings. Why wasn't that the case when the movie was made? (Or was it?)  Gotta go to sleep. I have to be up early tomorrow for jury duty. I'm actually looking forward to it. I'll bring both books I'm reading ( The Dew Breaker  and  Stupidity and Tears ) and the newspaper. I also expect it to be a good place to people-watch. It should be an interesting assortment of people.

      So why does it say that on top of my blog?  It turns out it's a link to a March of Dimes page with tips for what spouses of expecting mothers should do.  But it's definitely an interesting question to have at the top of my blog.  (Yes, I was looking at my own blog.)  It's a little disconcerting.  Almost like a challenge: "No?  You're not a new dad?  Why not?"  Well, at least that's the way I took it.  Make of that what you will.  I just bought a bunch of CDs at Philly Record Exchange.  All jazz.  The past couple of days I've been listening to more jazz, but prior to that I hadn't been listening to so much jazz.  I've been in the mood for sort of straight-ahead, hard-bop type stuff.  This is what I bought:  Jimmy Smith - Cool Blues (from '58, with Blakey and Lou Donaldson) Charlie Persip & the Jazz Statesmen (Freddie Hubbard, Ronnie Matthews, Ron Carter, &amp; others) Curtis Fuller - Blues-ette ('59, with Benny Golson, Tommy Flanagan, Jimmy Garrison, and Al Harewood) Rahsaan Roland Kirk - A Standing Eight (his last 3 albums on 2 discs) Sun Ra - Somewhere Else  Okay, so I know those last two aren't exactly "straight-ahead."  I'm listening to Jimmy Smith now (actually an Eddie McFadden guitar solo).  I listened to a couple tracks from the Charlie Persip.  He's a drummer who played with Dizzy in the 60s (and maybe late 50s).  I saw him at the Clef Club a couple of years ago with Archie Shepp--one of the 2 or 3 best shows I've ever been to.  Archie was incredible--he came out all dapper in a dark suit and fodora.  He looked so damn dignified.  And he played mostly standards--not at all what I'd expected.  He even sang a little bit.   He was incredible, and Charlie Persip blew our minds, playing all kinds of crazy stuff, even throwing in some hip hop beats.   I haven't listened to the Sun Ra or Rahsaan discs yet, which I suppose are the more interesting stuff.  At least, I have less of an idea of what to expect from them.  Maybe I'll blog about them after I listen.  I almost bought a Charles Gayle CD, but I decided to put it off.  I don't think I've ever heard him, but I think it's the kind of stuff that you really have to just sit down and listen to, eyes shut, for a half-hour or so.  I used to do that all the time, with  everything , but not so much lately.  If I'm not doing that now, though, when I have a lot of free time, when will I be doing it?  During the schoolyear, I find it hard to clear my mind enough to listen like that.  Thoughts about my kids and the day always intrude.  Maybe I'll change that come September.   Off to read.  I was going to go get coffee and read in the Italian Market, but it's looking kind of nasty out, so maybe I'll just stay here.  I'm reading  The Dew Breaker , by Edwidge Danticat.  It's a collection of inter-connected stories that take place in Haiti and Brooklyn.  It's fantastic, really beautiful writing, the kind of stories you want to re-read as soon as you finish.

      I'm not exactly sure why I decided to start this blog, but I think it might be fun. It gives me another choice when I feel like communicating with no one in particular. There's my tape recorder, which I started using on a roadtrip a couple of years ago (the idea being that I could talk into it while I drove). I go through periods where I use it a lot, but not so much lately. Then there's my journal, which is mostly for school-related stuff. It has thoughts about specific things that happen in school, but it's more for ideas about things that I  want  to happen in my classroom. I think I have this conception in my mind of the perfect classroom--I guess it's more like a dream that's always evolving and, thus, somewhat hard to pin down. Anyway, my journal is the closest I've come to a tangible expression of this vision. There's also my little notebook, which is for little tiny tidbits, from the mundane ("disks--at least 10") to the practical but not mundane ("study New Orleans funeral parades with class") to the clever but maybe not practical ("Teach: Petra Haden --> multitracking --> synthesis/analysis"). It also has shopping lists, music to check out, movies to see, books to read, phone numbers, etc. So the blog is yet another option, which means that sometimes I'll be paralyzed and not be able to figure out where to communicate with no one/myself/strangers. Time to make dinner--pasta with zucchini sauce.
