      Friday morning about 6:45am Jim called me on the cell phone.  Jim Wanted to know if i had cooled down yet and wanted to talk  about what had happened the day before, he asked if I really  wanted to quit or just said it out of anger, I told him that  at times he just pisses me off to know end, amd I was sorry  I stormed out like that and for what I had said and that I really didn't want to leave my job.  He told me to come to work and at the end of the day we could  talk about it.  Pic of the BOSS.               So I got ready and went to work, but we never did talk about  it at the end of the day.

      Last week it all came to a head after months of holding it in,  I quit my job and this is what happened:  You know how little things can build up and you hold it inside  until you can't take it any more? Well thats what I did.   I came back last week at the end of the day and Jim started on  me about something that was of no big deal but I blew up and started  yelling at him and him at me and the next thing I know I quit.  I stormed out of the office and went home. It hit me what I had  just done about half way home.  I knew I was wrong in geting mad and quiting but what was done was done. I went home and told my wife and she didn't say a word.

      I work for Lilac Window Cleaning and this is my story.  I started working here back in 1988 and left after a year and came back 6 years later after I let go by Main window cleaning after a medical problem.  It was a good time to move on so it was no big deal.  Me and the owner seem to hit heads a lot but it also happens with the other guys too.  Jim (owner) is not the easiest person to get along with.  At the beginning of the day Jim gives us a route sheet with all the information about the Equipment  we need for the day and a list and addresses of the jobs and who we are working with and the truck  we will take.  Most of the time he has to remember who won't work together that week because of arguments we  have had the last few days. It's not easy doing his job most of the time. That"s why most of us call him daddy.
