       I'm generally in agreement with the results of this test.  I'm not terribly Sociable, except with a few people I've checked out beforehand and decided are ok to do stuff with outside of whatever comfortable situation I've checked them out in.  (Nice sentence.)  That must tie in with Gregariousness.  Just the thought that I could have any element of gregariousness within me is laughable.  Now, I'm not trying to claim that I'm dull, or that I never make people laugh - that's not true, and some people think I'm hilarious.  But when I think of the "real me," my elemental self, it's rather more introspective than that.  Assertiveness.  74%.  That seems pretty high.  Maybe it's just that I have a low tolerance, particularly lately, for slack-assed behavior and attitudes.  But my so-called assertiveness comes out in a really pathetic way, more in the nature of backstabbing and whining than actually confronting problems.  Something to work on.  Activity level = 54%.  I'm not sure exactly what that's supposed to mean, but if it means I'm only active 54% of the time, it's probably right.  The other 46% of the time I'm sitting around reading novels & blogs, checking my email, watching TV, taking naps, talking on the phone or to colleagues, etc.  I'm not what you'd call "motivated".  Excitement-Seeking is deceptive.  Surely I  want  more excitement than 46% would indicate, but I'm also dragged down by some mitigating factors that are hard to fight, like a large amount of debt and some unreasonable personal responsibilities/agreements that limit my mobility.  I can't whine too much about my fate, but I can say that there's more to it than this indicates.  Enthusiasm = 46%.  Yeah, that's about right.  Less than half the time, things feel like they're worth getting off the couch for.  Or, more accurately, getting off of my [goddamned] Ikea  urlLink Poang chair  and  urlLink footstool  for.  Maybe I'm jaded, but I spent a lot of time when I was in high school and college getting very excited and pumped up about a lot of things, and those things never turned out to be worth the energy expended.  Trust = 42%.  This is exactly what the last sentence from the paragraph above is all about.  Nothing like getting burned to make one realize why touching fire is a bad idea.  Granted, when someone or something is worth it, it's all the sweeter.  But that's why it's rare.  Morality = 30%.  Does this mean that 70% of the time I'm immoral?  Or I make immoral choices?  Or I have immoral responses to simple questions?  Cause if that's true, what's the point of continuing?  No, seriously, I think it's probably because I don't agree with black-and-white  anything , and I don't agree that laws should be strictly enforced.  (I don't think that the Illinois ARDC would think too highly of that, but they should be more concerned with the death penalty, George Ryan, and Meg Gorecki right now to consider the musings of an inactive attorney who's never practiced anyway.)  Perhaps that section should be called "Ascribes to Majority Morality".  Altruism = 54%.  That means I'm a sap more than half of the time.  Two weeks ago it would have been much higher.  I'm actively trying to get a handle on my tendency to do things for other people that they can and should do for themselves.  It's dehumanizing to them and futile for me.  (See the  urlLink Calvin and Hobbes  strip from today for an illustration of this.) There's a place for altruism in my life, and I hope to expand it again when I can direct it away from things and people that abuse it.  Cooperation = 38%.  Hmmm.  Several of my responses to the results seem to have been affected by the situation at work over the last few weeks.  Interesting. Yes, my cooperation level is low.  And I'm going to say something that, for anyone who's ever worked in a public library (or maybe any library) marks me forever as a Library Person: But I can just do it myself easier than I can explain to anyone else how it's done.  And it doesn't matter what "it" is.  It doesn't matter if it's work-related or anything else.  I have no desire to be a team with anyone.  I can do it, but I'll almost inevitably (and that's a loaded word if ever there was one) hate it.  Anyone want to be on a committee with me?!  Modesty = 26%.  Talk about loaded.  What can I say?  I'm confident in my intellectual abilities.  I'm  very  confident in my professional abilities.  There are some things at which I lack skill or talent, but that I enjoy anyway, and pleasure must take the place of skill or talent in some areas of life or perhaps life would not perpetuate, at least as we know it.  Too many people spend too much time flapping their jaws in false defense of their modesty, or as Cullen Hightower put it, "Sometimes we deny being worthy of praise, hoping to generate an argument we would be pleased to lose."  That's just not me.  Sympathy = 54%.  I try to be conscious of other peoples' feelings.  Sometimes I succeed too well and end up going overboard in my attempt to make things right.  More often, though, I probably miss the nuances and am not there when I should be or in the way that I should be.  That's a goal, certainly.  I find it very hard to believe that my Self-Efficacy could be as high as 62%.  After all, I'm sitting at the computer blogging my head off instead of following my clearly-laid path for the day.  I guess that I'm better at it at work than I am at home.  Neatness has never been my strong point.  I get by, and I don't think people talk about me behind my back, but I'm certainly not a pinnacle of personal pride.  About 30% of the time, I get it mostly right.  The house is usually untidy, but it's not dirty.  Even the cats don't get "dirty" and the house doesn't stink like "cat".  My desk at work, though, is a nightmare.  And the dining room table is a magnet for mail and paperwork of all kinds.  I could claim that I come by it naturally, since my mom's the same way, but I think it's mostly me.  I'm starting to feel guilty again, for not working.  More on this later.

       Yeah, I know.  There are other things that I'm supposed to be doing.  But this is my first day off this week, and I'm  really  tired of doing what I'm supposed to be doing.  And I was waiting for water to boil so I could make tea so I'd have caffeine so I'd be awake enough to concentrate on revisions to my thesis, so I decided to take the larger version of the test I took on Tuesday.

       My boss received an email message today from a cataloger in our consortium.  This professional person, who shall remain nameless, stated that she plans to attend a workshop regarding the changes that were made by OCLC resulting in the new Dewey Decimal Classification - DDC22, which was released in July, 2003.  According to the message, the workshop attendees are to bring "their Dewey" to the workshop.  This "cataloger" noticed that our library "has the update" (i.e. is in possession of DDC22, as opposed to DDC21, which it replaced), and wanted to know if she could BORROW OUR COPY FOR THE WORKSHOP.  We could send it to her on the delivery van, she wrote, and she'd return it by van on the day following the workshop.    1. What does she think we'd use as a reference for cataloging during the week we'd be without it, counting on 3 days for delivery each way and 1 day for her to use it? 2. What does she think we (i.e. the other cataloger at SPL and I) would use at the workshop, if we were going to attend, as "our Dewey"? 3. Why has she not felt compelled to ACQUIRE the new Dewey for her own library, since the update has been available for six months?  This raises several other issues of professionalism that I hadn't intended to address, much less upon which to riff, but really.  SPL was the first library in the NIC consortium to catalog DDC22.  Does that mean that no other library in NIC  has  it? Or have they just not cataloged it yet?  Or do they not intend to catalog it?  And for all of our (i.e. the consortium's, and especially the cataloging group's) bitching about specificity and accuracy, what are  they  doing using an old classification system?  Particularly some of the more vehement (read: blowhardish) members of the group?!    In her response to the email message, my boss wrote that we would not be able to send our Deweys for the workshop.  The implication was that the other library should buy its own.    Duh.

       "How curious to realize the betrayal wasn't so much in the act but in the need."  (Victoria Alexander,  urlLink The Husband List )  Lots of people think romance novels are crap or mush - a waste of words or paper, anesthetic to the female mind.  I'm not going to spend a lot of time defending them (in part because  urlLink it's been done  and in part because that's not my point at the moment), but I will assert that nuggets of truth can be found in surprising places.  Sometimes I think I'm just reading for entertainment and not using my brain at all, learning anything, "thinking" beyond the most basic action required for the comprehension of fiction, and then a sentence or a phrase will appear and work its way into my consciousness, and it will all have been proven worthwhile.    I might forget the names of the protagonists of  The Husband List  over time, but that line will remain with me.

        Making lists  always makes me more stressed out than having no clue.  I woke up this morning thinking about everything that I needed to do today.  I made a mental list - things to remember to take to the office; things to do at work; things to talk with people about at work; things to do after work.  By the time I finished, I was ready to get back in bed and pull the covers over my head.  Not surprisingly, I haven't been  on time to work  at all in 2004.  The Borders store in DeKalb, Illinois is managed by  cretins .  They had a fundraiser for literacy - like the one held at Barnes & Noble - and gave all the money to the DeKalb Public Library.  (B&N split their proceeds between SPL and DPL.)      I miss Wolfgang .  We haven't had a real conversation since we went out for lunch at Panera about 4 months ago.  He might disagree, but I think he's very smart, well-read, and conversant about pretty much everything that's worth talking about.  Not to mention that he knows more about current music than I could ever hope to, and he gives a  killer  back rub.  Sometimes the  hardest thing  in the world to do is, not a half hour later, the easiest.  And undoubtedly the best.  Tara had to do something today that wasn't easy or comfortable, but she was able to do it.  There are no awards ceremonies for stuff like this, but there should be.  I don't like ginger, and I don't like decaffeinated tea, but I like  Republic of Tea's Ginger Peach Decaf tea .  It doesn't make sense that I ever even tried it, but I like it.  A  snow day  would be great right about now.  I've been thinking some lately about this vague sense of unhappiness, and how it's someone else's fault.  But the odd corollary to that is that when I have the rare sense of unmitigated happiness, I think it's genuine and springs from within, and isn't dependent upon anyone else.  At some point I've got to reconcile this.   Who's in charge?    Four things I know for sure : 1. Television  character  I'd most like to have slept with: Steven Hyde, from  That 70s Show  2. Point (in my life) at which I'd like for that to have happened: when I was 16.  Much better to have done that with him than with Blake.  And much better to have done it then than when I did. 3. Television  actor  I'd most like to have slept with (opinion as of 10:33 PM, 1/26/04): Connor Trinneer, from  Star Trek: Enterprise  4. Spanish sports figure with whom I'd love to play pool (at least): Jose Maria Olazabal    It's been a long day, and I spent a lot of it alone, thinking -- I took notes.

       A neighbor down the block, whom I've never met, is cleaning the 2" of snow that we got today off of his driveway.  With a leaf-blower.  An electric leaf-blower.  It's about 23°, with wind chill of 16° thanks to the 6 mph winds, and he's  blowing  the snow off his driveway.

       Sometimes I think this blogging thing is all about me - my opportunity to let my youngest child egotism thing run rampant, in a way that I really can't in my "regular life" with its responsibilities and complications and humdrum realities.  And then every now and then there's a reminder that life's about a hell of a lot more than me, like when  urlLink Jenica  posted the lyrics to "Divorce Song" by Liz Phair.  I'm not a Liz Phair fan.  I'm not even sure if I'd know any of her music if I heard it.  But the lyrics to this song are, well, here they are:   And when I asked for a separate room It was late at night And we'd been driving since noon But if I'd known How that would sound to you I would have stayed in your bed For the rest of my life Just to prove I was right That it's harder to be friends than lovers And you shouldn't try to mix the two Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy Then you know that the problem is you And it's true that I stole your lighter And it's also true that I lost the map But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to I had to take your word on that But if you'd known How that would sound to me You would have taken it back And boxed it up and buried it in the ground Boxed it up and buried it in the ground Boxed it up and buried it in the ground Burned it up and thrown it away You put in my hands a loaded gun And then told me not to fire it When you did the things you said were up to me And then accused me of trying to fuck it up But you've never been a waste of my time It's never been a drag So take a deep breath and count back from ten And maybe you'll be alright And the license said You had to stick around until I was dead But if you're tired of looking at my face I guess I already am But you've never been a waste of my time It's never been a drag So take a deep breath and count back from ten And maybe you'll be alright   I have to be grateful that I've never been to that point, literally.  And envious, that I haven't written anything like that.  Where feelings are so clearly conveyed through words.    I've been trying to read Judith Kitchen's  urlLink The House on Eccles Road .  It's a 'good book', for what it's worth, but it's hard for me to read.  It's almost as if I think I could have written it.  Not "I could have written this better", but I can imagine myself having written  this book .  Like these lines: “Nothing in his life was quite the way he’d planned it, if wanting could be called a plan.  He supposed it couldn’t, because you’d have to decide how to go about getting what you wanted, and he hadn’t really figured out how to do that.”    I used to believe, or at least say, that "love is all there is."  If we don't just dump our affection on other people (relatively indiscriminately), then we as humans are weakened and lose the sense of what separates us from non-humans.  But maybe that's not really so true.  Obviously, there's some value to withholding affection.  Perhaps it's the ability to feel a pull toward someone and to intentionally pull away that marks us as an advanced consciousness.  If the decision isn't easy, but we make it anyway, then it's in our benefit and to our credit to have made it.    Or, this could be as much delusion as the old conception.   It probably doesn't matter anyway.

       I'm in the mode to test, I guess.  I took Humanmetrics.com's Jung Typology Test.  It's basically the same as the SimilarMinds Myers-Briggs Personality Test.  My type is INFP, "Introverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving".  That means I'm strongest in the Introverted category and weakest in the Perceiving category.  The strength of the preferences, by percentage, is:   Introversion: 67  Intuition: 44  Feeling: 67  Perception: 11  According to "Portrait of the Healer (iNFp)", ©1996 Prometheus Nemesis Book Company:    Healer Idealists are abstract in thought and speech, cooperative in striving for their ends, and informative and introverted in their interpersonal relations. Healers present a seemingly tranquil, andnoticeablyy pleasant face to the world, and though to all appearances  they might seem reserved, and even shy , on the inside they are anything but reserved, having a capacity for caring not always found in other types. They care deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite cause, and their fervent aim is to bring peace and integrity to their loved ones and the world.   Healers have a profound sense of idealism derived from a  strong personal morality , and they  conceive of the world as an ethical, honorable place . Indeed, to understand Healers, we must understand their idealism as almost boundless and selfless, inspiring them to make extraordinary sacrifices for someone or something they believe in. The Healer is the Prince or Princess of fairytale, the King's Champion or Defender of the Faith, like Sir Galahad or Joan of Arc. Healers are found in only 1 percent of the general population, although, at times, their idealism leaves them feeling even more isolated from the rest of humanity.   Healers seek unity in their lives, unity of body and mind, emotions and intellect, perhaps because they are likely to have a sense of inner division threaded through their lives, which comes from their often unhappy childhood. Healers live a fantasy-filled childhood, which, unfortunately, is discouraged or even punished by many parents. In a practical-minded family, required by their parents to be sociable and industrious in concrete ways, and also given down-to-earth siblings who conform to these parental expectations, Healers come to see themselves as ugly ducklings. Other types usually shrug off parental expectations that do not fit them, but not the Healers. Wishing to please their parents and siblings, but not knowing quite how to do it, they try to hide their differences, believing they are bad to be so fanciful, so unlike their more solid brothers and sisters. They wonder, some of them for the rest of their lives, whether they are OK. They are quite OK, just different from the rest of their family-swans reared in a family of ducks. Even so, to realize and really believe this is not easy for them. Deeply committed to the positive and the good, yet taught to believe there is evil in them, Healers can come to develop a certain fascination with the problem of good and evil, sacred and profane. Tutors are drawn toward purity, but can become engrossed with the profane, continuously on the lookout for the wickedness that lurks within them. Then, when Healers believetheyy have yielded to an impure temptation, they may be given to acts of self-sacrifice in atonement. Others seldom detect this inner turmoil, however, for the struggle between good and evil is within the Healer, who does not feel compelled to make the issue public.    And from "INFP Profile - Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving" by Joe Butt, © 1996-2003 by Joe Butt,   Famous INFPs: Homer Virgil Mary, mother of Jesus St. John, the beloved disciple St. Luke; physician, disciple, author William Shakespeare, bard of Avon Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (Evangeline) A.

       I was emailing with my friend John about school stuff.  The subject of getting into grad school came up, and the fact that I didn't get into the University of Michigan History Ph.D. program.  Not only was I rejected, but they sent the letter so fast that they didn't have time to sign it.    It arrived without a signature.  Maybe 2 days after I'd applied.  But it wasn't really all that upsetting to me.  At the time I was disappointed and probably drank a lot to cover it up.  The monetary investment alone was significant.  But truly, there wasn't - and isn't - much of my ego invested in the place from which I earn[ed] my diploma.  It was about the education.  It got me thinking, though.  Was I embarrassed about not getting in to Michigan?  No, not really.  It's more like I'm proud of it.  It's a good story to tell, actually.  It garners me a little bit of sympathy, it's funny, and everybody hates the big corporate university that can't even reject people in a nice way.  And I wasn't a  bad  applicant, after all.  I graduated from a decent (although certainly not outstanding) undergraduate institution with good grades (3.201), particularly in my major (History, 3.25) and minors (Political Science, 3.0, and Philosophy, 3.29).  Thanks to the quarter system, I had taken a very wide variety of classes.  My recommendations were outstanding - all of the professors from whom I'd requested them had offered me copies of what they gave to the schools, just so I knew what the schools were getting.  I'd been out of undergrad for a couple of years, so I was slightly more mature (and therefore more appealing?) than my 20-year-old counterparts.  My GRE scores were really good: Quantitative, 580; Verbal, 640; Analytical, 730.  So why didn't they want me?  The point of this isn't really the getting in, or not getting in, to UM's Ph.D. program.  It's really about my big, honkin' ego.  Why do I still know or care what my GPA was from undergrad?  Why do I have my GRE scores memorized?  Why am I proud of these things that don't matter at all?    I think that it's important, and sensible, and understandable, and logical, to be proud of some things even if they involve a certain about of self-love or vanity.  For instance, some of my friends can't say enough about the fact that I graduated from law school and passed the bar on my first try.  (There used to be the inevitable John F. Kennedy, Jr. comparisons until he died; it must've been really sad for him to have had to deal with that constantly.  I mean, there was so much more to him than that.)  But I'm obviously not doing  anything  with my law degree right now, much less my license.  It's just sitting there in my brain or my safe deposit box, respectively, gathering dust, wasting a hell of a lot of money (yes, I'm still paying the student loans).  It was a waste of time.  It was a waste of money.  I'm not saying that the process wasn't valuable.  I'm not saying that I didn't learn anything.  I'm not saying, necessarily, that if I could go back knowing what I know now, that I wouldn't do it again.  I sure as hell wouldn't take the same classes, and I wouldn't have fooled myself into thinking that I could convince LS that he was a human being and so should treat others as if they were.  I learned a lot.  But law school changed me in some very significant, very negative ways.  I see potential liability  everywhere .  I find it hard to talk without using words like "mitigate" and "reprehensible" - I'm not kidding, it changed my vocabulary drastically.  It's not a part of me of which I feel particularly proud.  If I was, I'd be an attorney.  I'm not.  I can't be without feeling like I've sold my soul.  I have the legal education, and of that I can be grateful.  My J.D. means more to me than my esq. ever could.  So when my friends ooh and aah about the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission card in my wallet, what can I say?  It's nothing.  It  really  is nothing to me.  What am I proud of?  Mostly things that I can never really tell anyone about, or that I could tell but no one would really "get".  Like the scars on my left leg from going through the French doors at 106 Main St.  Like taking the Big Wheel back.  Like managing to never tell a soul about something that if I'd told, could've changed the lives of at least four people in a very real, very sad way.    I'm proud of Seymour Byman calling me Ophelia even though I managed to get all the way through 4 years at WSU and who knows how many of his and Marianna's classes without ever actually reading  Hamlet .  Even though later I came to understand that being called Ophelia either meant he thought I was a suicidal freak or ... maybe he knew I hadn't read  Hamlet .  Hmmm.  I'm proud of my second ear piercing, even though it's so not edgy or trendy or anything, but it means something to me that I can't even explain to myself.  All I know is that when I reach up to twist my earring backs and feel 2 of them on each ear, it's a tiny rush of joy.  I am, for some unknown godawful reason, proud of not having quit my job in a huff - yet.  Midtown Foods, I quit in a very bad way (although I was later hired back through odd circumstances).  Kaplan Educational Center, I gave two weeks' notice but in a huff and not very productively.  My current position makes me much more crazy (albeit at better pay) than either of those did, but I've managed to remain patient to this point.  Saving it up for a big blowout?  Biding my time?  Or somehow connected to the reality of owing a whole lot of people and entities a whole lot of money?  Doesn't matter, I suppose.  I'm proud of being friends, in any way that I can claim, with John (my philosopher).  And Brian, although that "friendship" certainly is all over the board and can't be counted on.  And Rob.  And Steve Stewart (who is not the Steve in the band, thank you very much).  And Jon and Mike, and Joe (and Jim).  And Geoff, of course, even though I'm convinced that he thinks I'm insane.  And Eric.  And Ted, who got out while the getting was good.  (But that reminds me how much I miss Dan and Dan and Chris, and Chris, too.)  And Matt, even though he is too young and long-haired to have anything to do with old friends now.  Maybe I see a lot of holes where the links to my past used to be, but there are a lot of amazing people there, too.  It's humbling and I'm lucky.  With all this, why would I care about law school?

       This is funny - I'm concentrating really hard, trying to find an OCLC match for an obscure music CD called "Classical Christmas" that I'm recataloging.  There's almost nothing to go by, so I'm paging through FirstSearch, starting with the contents line, looking for "Good King Wenceslas".  At the same time, the CD that I'm listening to is playing in the background.  It's Erasure's  Pop , which I love and adore and can't get enough of.  Yeah, it dates me.  Yeah, it was trendy even when it was popular, which was a while ago.  But I  love  it.  And even though I own the disc, we also have it in the collection at the library, so when I'm here I check it out to the Professional Development account and play it.  (And when I'm alone, I play it over-and-over-and-over....)    So while I was looking for Classical Christmas and Good King Wenceslas, "Drama!" was playing.  It's not one of Erasure's more radio-ready songs, but it's fantastic.  Read the lyrics closely and you'll see why.  You'll also see why I was just chuckling while I worked.  Erasure,  Drama!    One rule for us, for you another Do unto yourself as you see fit for your brother Is that not within your realm of understanding? A fifty second capacity of mind, too demanding? Well then poor unfortunate you There are a myriad of things that you can do Like pick up a pen and paper (Pick up a pen or paper) Or go talk to a friend (Go and talk to a friend) The mystery of the future (The mystery of the future) No violence or revenge  Your shame is never ending Just one psychological drama after another You are guilty and how you ever entered into this life God only knows, the infinite complexities of love  We all have the ability Our freedom is fragile We all laugh and we cry don't we? We all bleed and we smile  Your shame is never ending Just one psychological drama after another You are guilty (Guilty) and how you ever entered into this life God only knows, you're not to sacrifice the art of love  Your shame is never ending Just one psychological drama after another We are guilty (Guilty) and how we ever entered into this life God only knows, the infinite complexities of love  We are guilty and how you ever entered into this life The Lord only knows, we're not to sacrifice the art of love  We are guilty and how you ever entered into this life The Lord only knows, the infinite complexities of love  We are guilty and how you ever entered into this life The Lord only knows, the ultimate necessity of love   And I'm looking for "Classical Christmas"?!

       The walls are closing in.    Not working today.  I should be revising my thesis, or at least closely reading it so I can start revising it this weekend.  I should be writing thank you notes for Christmas gifts.  I should be cleaning my bathroom, which is starting to look like an extensive science experiment.  I should be brushing the cats, who look like little Yetis with their winter fur on their tiny bodies.  I should be doing laundry or putting away the clean dishes or vacuuming.  I should be writing back to Christmas cards or email.    "Should"  Tara gave me a tiny gift book called  urlLink Oh Friend of Friends: Peanuts on Friendship .  It is made up of Peanuts comic strips and quotations about friendship.  I just sat on the floor with the cats in my lap and read it through, sniffling and wiping my eyes.  I've always loved Peanuts.  It was very much a part of my childhood, watching the specials on TV and reading the strip in the newspaper.  I had a Snoopy watch with a turquoise-colored band, and his arms (front legs, I suppose) were the hands.  Sometimes someone manages to find a gift that seems small and maybe inconsequential, but signifies more.  I'm not saying that her other gifts, including Nancy Pearl's  urlLink Book Lust: Recommended Reading for Every Mood, Moment and Reason , aren't wonderful and appreciated.  It's sure to be fascinating reading and I'm looking forward to getting a professional librarian's perspective on the eternal question of What to Read.  (The author is also famous for being the model for the  urlLink Librarian Action Figure , making her a cult heroine to some and a target of scorn and derision for others.)    Back to the Peanuts book.  There's a great statement from Ralph Waldo Emerson: "It is one of the blessings of friends that you can be stupid with them."  That may be what this blog business is all about.  I got a lot of tea for Christmas.   urlLink Lemon Green ,  urlLink Raspberry Green ,  urlLink Wild Berry Plum Green ,  urlLink Blackcurrent , and  urlLink Citron .  I'm happy!  Tea always makes the day better.  I'm also glad that I got such a variety of flavors.  Not sure when I started drinking fruit tea almost exclusively, but I do find that I enjoy it more than plain teas, particularly hot.  My mom gave me a little box shaped like Wrigley Field.  I've started to collect little boxes - this is a small collection, though, and really needs no help getting any bigger.  So I pulled the box out of the gift bag and ooohed and aaahed appropriately, and she said, "Open it up!"  I could tell that it was empty, but I opened it anyway.  Then I screamed, because there's a little sound chip inside the cover that plays "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" and is light-sensitive.  I nearly had a coronary.  Mom knows I like the  urlLink Cubs  and thought it was perfect for my collection.  I particularly appreciate the sound factor.  I'm starting to feel guilty about all that "should" stuff.  Maybe it wasn't so productive to write it all out.    No nap today.

       Cataloging a book called  urlLink Doing our own thing : the degradation of language and music and why we should, like, care .  Pulled up the record in our  urlLink consortial database , to which only one library had attached an item - CV [, Illinois, Public Library].  It had only one subject heading: "English language--United States".  That seemed really weird, given the topic of the book.  Wouldn't it, I thought, be more...um... contentious  than that?  Perhaps more opinionated, argumentative, pointed?  Yet it was an OCLC record (and for anyone reading this who doesn't understand library-talk, an "OCLC record" means that it's kosher - as good as it's getting, the "right" record, the way it's  supposed  to be).  So I was even more curious.  Pulled up FirstSearch and looked at the original OCLC record.    There were SEVEN subject headings.  All of them were useful, lovely, interesting, and more complex than "English language--United States".  Want to see?  English language -- Variation -- United States.  Popular music -- United States -- History and criticism.  English language -- Written English -- United States.  English language -- Spoken English -- United States.  English language -- Social aspects -- United States.  English language -- United States -- Usage.  Language and culture -- United States.   That's what they  took out .  Why would they take that out?  Because it did  too good  a job of describing the book?  Because specificity is "bad"?  Because the average CV patron has an I.Q. of 3?    And isn't it painfully ironic to rip the useful subject headings out of a book about the degradation of our language by lazy-assed people?    So I replaced the bastardized record with the one containing all of the above subjects, and I'm still chock-full of righteous indignation and anger.  I want to call E, the library director in CV, and just scream at her.  Not to say anything, in particular, but just  scream .  She wouldn't understand the multi-syllable words I'd want to use anyway, so a prolonged shriek would suffice, yes?  This job sucks the life out of me, truly.

       This  is  not  good.  After posting my last blurb, I talked to a coworker for a few minutes about books to order, then moved to the front of the library to retrieve some materials that need re-cataloging.  Then a shelf collapsed on me.  After I dusted myself off and determined that I hadn't been hurt, I walked into my office and set the materials down on my desk, tipping over my paperclip container and spraying paperclips across the carpet.  I'd live in a bubble, but I'm probably allergic to plastic.

       Yesterday was a 99% wasted day.  (The 1% is reserved for some amazing news that I heard, but I'm not sharing yet because it's not widely known and anyway I want to just feel it bubbling away in me like mental Champagne for a while.)  - It was the first day I worked in the post-Jinny era.    - "My" big Christmas present - an  urlLink Alpine CDM-9803 In-Dash CD Player  - had a good day without me, as it has since it was installed.  I was also informed (rather sanctimoniously) how to turn it off, by the person to "gave it to 'me'".  - I emailed a good friend from high school with whom I'd reconnected over the last year by email, but from whom I hadn't heard in a while.  The message that I sent was short and I didn't really think about what I wrote until after I clicked "send", whereupon I realized that I sounded like I was expecting an apology - and I'm actually expecting to give one.  I feel like a jerk.  - Cutting a particularly funny or apropos comic strip from the newspaper last night, I wasn't paying attention to the end of the (very sharp) scissors and cut a divot in the end of my ring finger.  Well, more of a ravine than a divot.  It didn't even hurt - that's how deep the cut was.  It's making me type very slowly and badly.  It's my 2WSX finger.  Will today be better?

       Today was my last Christmas of 2003.  It always goes like that; that's the plan, and it always feels nice to have one last opportunity to do the gift-giving thing after the rest of the holiday stuff is over.  I got lots of really great stuff.  Some of it was "on my list", either on Amazon or that I'd written, or that I'd given in response to being asked specifically.  Some of it was just people knowing what I'd like.  Some things, though, were so out of the blue or completely not me that I wonder who the person was thinking of when they got them, because it obviously wasn't me.  I should be more "centered" and less prone to being sensitive to this sort of thing, but it's still disappointing to me.  When someone misses so utterly.  Or doesn't care enough to try.  But maybe I'm just greedy.

       Today was Tara's graduation day.  She received her  urlLink MLIS  from  urlLink Dominican University .  (She also has a  urlLink B.A. in Art History  from  urlLink NIU .)  The whole day was a lesson in friendship - the point of it, the value, the nuances and bittersweetness and tenderness and fear that are wrapped up in the idea of "friends".  Her parents were so glad that we could be there with her, and thanked us over and over for coming.  Where else would we be?  It never occurred to me that we would be anywhere else, and for as much as I tried to be copacetic about it, I'd have been disappointed if we hadn't been able to go to the ceremony.  I remember her talking about maybe wanting to get a graduate degree in library science, and then applying (would she have to take the GRE? Thank God, no!), and then getting accepted.  Buying the books (horribly expensive -  insanely  expensive, even for graduate classes, even as compared to law school books).  Working on the assignments.  Reading the novels and writing the papers.  How much of me wanted to have gone with her, taken each class with her, gotten the degree with her?  Not to take anything away from her, or to have decreased the fact that this was entirely her day - that's not what I mean at all.  But I saw what she was learning and how she was growing in something that I'll never understand in the same way, and along with feeling incredibly proud I felt a little bit left behind.  I didn't, though.  I made the choice to not take the classes, not do the work, not read the novels and write the papers and make the struggle and sacrifices, and I'm doubly proud of her because she was brave and strong enough to do it.  So her parents said "Thank you" repeatedly, and I never said anything meaningful in return because all I could think was, "Where else would I be?"    I spent some time last evening trying to decide what to wear to the ceremony.  It wasn't a pleasant hour, squishing myself into a suit, 2 dresses, and a skirt, only to decide that I'd wear black pants and a white linen shirt.  There was one funny moment (more surreal, really) when I had somehow wedged myself into the dress I wore in my high school friend Emily's wedding - black watch plaid with a black velvet collar, very "grown-up" and gorgeous and warm, so it seemed like just the thing for January in Illinois.  Well, it wouldn't have been the thing at all for a Catholic university's graduation ceremony, because I looked like a prostitute at a court appearance.  I've never had cleavage like I somehow managed to create in that dress.  Eeew.  So this morning I dressed in the black and white ensemble - it was definitely comfortable - and at some point realized I was horribly nervous.  I was polishing my nails and could barely bring brush to nail because my hands were shaking so badly.  What was there to be nervous about?  I just wanted everything to go perfectly for Tara and was concerned (afraid?) that something might go wrong.  Was I dressed badly, too casually?  Would she be embarrassed?  Would we be late and make her late, since we were riding together?  Would the person reading her name pronounce it "TAHR-uh" instead of "TARE-uh" when she was on stage to get her diploma?  I managed to keep everything in line until they arrived (on time) and we left (on time).  We got to Dominican early and wandered for a bit.  I wanted to impart some last-minute pithy bit of knowledge, or send her on her way with a laugh, but I was so close to tears that I had to bite my lip.  While we waited for the ceremony to start, I met her sister Shannon for the first time.  Shannon is her older sister by 2 years.  It's a significant relationship in her life and I've felt a little bit separate from "that part of her".  That sounds so deliberate, as if Tara has set out for us to be separate, and I know that's not the case.  Clarification: my own relationship with and understanding of my sister (who's also older than I am) is so complex, it's important to me to see first-hand and understand hers.  Maybe so I have a decent model for my own behavior, or maybe so I have some hope for the future.  I don't know.  But it was incredibly nice to meet Shannon because she's a window into a part of Tara that was shadowy before.  So while we sat and watched people file into the auditorium, I thought about the evolution of our friendship and what brought us from just knowing each other at work, to somehow each of us knowing that the other was someone who could be trusted with whatever we needed, to sitting in an auditorium on a Saturday morning waiting to celebrate a graduate degree and an incredibly wonderful new period of opportunity....  Lump in my throat again.  Her family talked amongst themselves, and we sat silently and just looked around, but it was ok - comfortable.  Not much that I could've said just then would've made sense.    The ceremony was long and, for lack of a better word, Catholic.  But I'll never forget it, either.  There was the usual pro-Dominican blathering (and the Alumni Association representative was particularly incomprehensible, which is never a good sign), combined with a truly horrid Benediction at the end by someone who was hungry for The Stage: "LET ME HEAR YOU SAY  AMEN !"  But the Commencement Address, given by Charles Bouchard, was meaningful and unforgettable.  (He's the president and associate professor of moral theology at Aquinas Institute of Theology in St. Louis.)  He talked about changing the world, or at least oneself, by being happy.  Not the kind of "happy" that is the totally subjective commercialized bullshit that is projected on us by the marketing people (did you hear that, brand new MBAs?!), but the "happy" that comes from leading productive, ethical lives.  And that comes from, among other things, being generative (leaving something behind, whether children or some other legacy such as work or good works), having a vocation (not just a thing to do, but listening to the  call  of one's life), and having friendships.  The friendships that matter are the ones that challenge us to be who we were meant to be, even if they (the friendships) aren't always comfortable.  But they mean  everything .  In the end, if we don't have friendship, there isn't much that we do have.  That's so  it .  That's what this whole thing's about.  I didn't have any other plans today.  It was just a Saturday in January.  I never work on Saturdays, and I didn't have anything else that I needed to do today.  Sure, if today hadn't been graduation I'd have slept late, read a lot, probably cleaned the house, folded laundry, caught up on my email, burned some CDs.  Sent that baby card to Amy and Eric.  Written some thank you notes for Christmas gifts.  But really, even if I'd had something terribly important planned for today - haircut appointments that couldn't be rescheduled, tickets to a sold-out play, friends wanting to come from out of town, checks that needed to be cashed before they expired - I'd have still wanted to be at that graduation ceremony.  It's all about the sense that without this, there's nothing else.  What's the point of sleeping in, if my crazy dreams can't be told over tea to my best friend?  After the ceremony we went to the  urlLink Weber Grill Restaurant in Lombard .  I had one of the best steaks of my life, a 14-ounce New York Strip that was as tender as the chocolate Bundt cake that they brought Tara for dessert at our pleading.  She was mildly embarrassed, but at least they didn't sing.  It was another bittersweet experience, mostly because I chose to sit across the round table from her.  I see her perhaps the most often of all the people at the table, so I felt like I had to go against my baser nature and insist that others be able to sit next to her.  We still managed to share many "speaking looks," though.  I was just crazy-proud and sad and happy all at once.  Too emotional to be talking a lot, anyway.  She sat between her dad and Shannon and looked frazzled and happy and tired and over-emotional, too.  What could I say?  I wanted to whack her on the ankle with my foot, just to communicate something personal and yet without deep meaning.  But the table was big and our legs are short and we'd  have probably cried anyway.    On the way home we talked about her job offer from the  urlLink Riverside Public Library  in Riverside, Illinois.  I'm not doing a good job of being impartial about it because I think it's a great opportunity and I have a good feeling about it.  I'm trying not to push (although I'm sure it doesn't seem that way).  It was another conversation like we've had thousands of times before, but this time it was in the back of her dad's SUV, in the dark, and we were talking about her potentially moving away from the area.  It was one of those "fraught with meaning" conversations that doesn't seem that way at the time.  We were just mulling over the meaning of being a manager.  I was trying to say, "You Can  Totally  Do That!"  But I think I was coming off as if I was saying, "Here's what you should do; take it from me, 'cause I'm older than you and know better...."  She didn't need lectures, particularly today.  I should've just stuffed my glove in my mouth and held her hand.  So I'm home now and thinking about this, and it's like the parable of the man who's walking and sees the pebbles and picks them up and puts them in his pocket.  He gets up the next morning and the pebbles have turned to jewels and he's both glad and sorry: glad that he's taken some, sorry that he hasn't taken more.  The original parable ends "and so it is with education."  I'm both glad and sorry, too.  Glad I've had this amazing, life-changing friendship for a period that now both seems to stretch endlessly back (so many opportunities squandered!) and seems to be unfairly brief.  Sorry that I haven't been more cognizant of it, treated it (and her) with more respect and reverence, taken the time to learn more from  her  experience, and been silent more around her so that I could hear her better.     Learn from this.

       * This is the first period of time in my life where I've had an actual "hairstyle".  Yes, I've had hair before, and yes, it's been styled.  And yes, it was cut and styled by a professional in whom I placed a great deal of trust.  (My hair is a vanity.)  But the current style can't be considered anything but a  "hairstyle" , and it's a little disturbing to me.  Random people have complimented me on it.  Lots of people have made a big deal out of it, including my 16-year-old niece, who shouldn't be noticing anything at all about her more-than-twice-as-old-as-she-is aunt, particularly her hair.  But she noticed, and told me how much she liked it.  And I was pleased, but I also squirmed.  Doesn't that mean that she didn't like what I had before?  Doesn't it mean that none of them liked what I had before?  I  loved  what I had before - over-long, curly, kind of messy, sort of trademark hair.  And now it's short and really ... traditional.  It's nice, and when I see it in the mirror I wonder who did it.  (And of course I know who did it - it was Lori, and I love it.)  But is it me?  Maybe I just need a new color.  * I've been carrying the following dreadful poem in my wallet since high school.  If anyone can tell me the title or author, they win a prize.   I know that love's irrational and blind; I know the heart's not subject to the mind, And can't be reasoned into beating faster; I know each soul is free to choose its master; Therefore had you but spoken from the heart, Rejecting my intentions from the start, I'd have no grievance, or at any rate I could complain of nothing but my fate. Ah, but so falsely to encourage me - That was a treason and a treachery For which you cannot suffer too severely, And you shall pay for that behavior dearly. Yes, now I have no pity, not a shred....   Although now, as I type it (for the dozenth time at least), I realize that it may be Shakespearean or something along that line.  It's certainly from that phase in my life, the Jay Klagge era, when I was depressed and moped constantly and wanted nothing but to have something immensely painful to FEEEEEEEEL.  But the offer still stands - find me a title and author and I'll pay!  * Today's Jinny's last day, half of my staff of supervisees, my buddy with whom I listen to classical music in the afternoons and surreptitiously slam co-workers.  She's pretty calmly going through her day of people stopping by to hug her and wish her well.  I'm feeling like sliding off my chair under my desk to bawl.    Must do work now.

I've been futzing with it on and off for a couple of hours and I'm beating my head against the wall.  I've read the instructions a dozen times, installed the two lines of code where they belong, and still can't do what I want to do.  Yargh.  So if anyone is, by any chance, reading this, and is, by any chance, trying to comment, please be patient.  It will come, I promise.  I'm not sure when, though.

       This is something that I've been working on, mentally, for a while, and I'm just now ready to share it.  I can't guarantee that it makes sense.    I feel like an octopus.  Well, I'm the octopus  body , anyway.  And I've got all these responsibilities and things that are pulling me in different directions, like the arms (legs?) of the octopus go in all different directions.  But the animal as a whole can only move in one direction and can't get pulled in competing directions or it'll fly apart and (apparently) die.  (Octopuses - is it octopi? - can't just re-grow parts of their bodies like worms can, can they?  Otherwise this whole analogy gets shot to hell.)  So, for the sake of argument, here are my arms:   1.  "Regular" life.  The typical, day-to-day stuff of home relationships and laundry and reading the newspaper before it's not news anymore.  Picking up prescriptions and remembering to send birthday cards.  Brushing the cats.  Taken individually, these things are not a life sentence.  As a whole, though, they sometimes feel almost terminal.  2.  Work.  This is totally up in the air.  I work 32 hours a week (and even that is not quite the way it's supposed to be) at  urlLink this library .  I head a department of 2 (yes, 2), one of whom put in her notice a week and a half ago.  I work for a stereotypical power-hungry idiot, the kind of person who makes decisions on a whim and can't understand why no one takes her seriously.  Just thinking about it makes me want to scream.  But I'm over-educated (B.A., J.D., M.A. cand. 2004 - see #3, below) and in this area, that makes me almost unemployable.  If it were only the  work , I'd  love  my job.  But my boss and several of the people with whom I work are either so irritating or so irredeemably foolish that it really sucks the life out of me to be there.  Naturally, though, I can't leave.  Responsibilities.  3.  School.  Need to finish writing my thesis by March 15 - meaning it's due in final form, with all the @!#$ing signatures, to  urlLink the grad school  at  urlLink Eastern Michigan University , by that date.  That's only 2.25 months away!  Granted, there are "only 3 things" that need to be done before I can get those signatures, but they are a complete re-write of the third chapter (of which I was particularly fond, naturally), a complete removal of one theme from all 6 chapters, and revision of the conclusion to bring it in line with the historical theory of the members of my thesis committee.    4.  Money.  #2, above, does not provide enough of this to satisfy my desires, and certainly not enough to take care of...  5.  Extended family.  One issue wrapped up in this is the huge loans that my family made toward the down-payment on the house I'm living in.  They made the loans in the form of legal gifts, meaning that they signed gift letters saying that the "gifts" never need to be repaid, but there was an understanding that they would be repaid.  And my parents are thinking seriously of retiring soon, so it would be nice if they had at least some of the money that they're owed.  It's only fair. There's also the continuing saga of my sister.  She stormed out last Christmas after an argument, left in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve, drove home to Tennessee from Minnesota  alone  through a major storm, and hasn't really been in contact with anyone in the family except my dad since then.  She called on Christmas Eve this year to say she's getting married.  Not sure what to do with that.  6.  Friends.  For some reason, even though I consider myself a grumpy, unsocial person (perhaps I should say "introverted"), I've been lucky to have developed a web of friendships over the last few years.  At least one of them is really life-changing, the kind that keeps me up nights thinking about the importance of not doing anything to screw it up because it means so much to me.  Others are really casual, the kind that are totally by email and can be left for a month or two at a time but when resumed, feel as welcoming as they were before.  Some are time-consuming and draining but worthwhile in some indefinable way.  I know that some of this new "aura" of friendship has come in response to what happened last Christmas with Jane (my sister).  For the first several months of last year, I was really shaken by what I thought was a significant flaw in my personality that caused the fight.  It made me think about the way that I treated people and regarded my relationships.  (Or maybe it just made me shut up for a few minutes, which would have been equally valuable.)   So now I have a lot of friends, and it's great.  It's never been this way before.  I actually feel like my attention is valuable and that people are competing for it.  (Ah, ego!)  The down-side?  I'm tired!  I have a dozen email messages in my inbox to reply to.  There's a clear preference for the couple of people with or upon whom I spend my time (and by "upon" I mean by writing email or sending letters and stuff, not actually "upon", and anyone who's thinking that should wash out their brain with soap!).  So I struggle to make the others, about whom I also have feelings but not the same degree of urgency, not realize either that they're "at the top of my list" or that there is a list at all.  Maybe that's ego, too.  Maybe they don't care, and I occupy the same mid-level friendship for them that they do for me.  And maybe it's because I'm not an experienced friendship juggler that I'm not emotionally equipped to handle it.  I guess I'd rather not be so secure that I never thought about it, though.  7.  Fantasy world.  Quitting my job, watching TV, eating potato chips and drinking Coke all day.  Traveling with one of my friends.  Regressing.  Looking up old friends.  Reading.  Writing the novel and dedicating it to He Without Whom.  Maybe, for once, feeling like I've done exactly what I want to do, without troubling myself to worry about how it's going to affect everybody else.  (Yeah, and there's a reason it's called "fantasy".)  8.  Inclination.  What I want to do, all the time, is write and read.  For a long time when I was much younger, I wanted to be a photographer.  I convinced myself that news photography (actually, sports) was my career choice, because that was the most secure option for a "real" photographer (i.e. not a graduation photo shill or a Sears Photo Studio fixture).  It was still my plan when I went to college and declared Photojournalism as my major.  Less than a quarter later (yes,  urlLink my undergrad institution  was on a quarter system until about 3 years ago, so every 10 weeks we started 4 or 5 new classes.  I took more than twenty classes in my major.) I'd ditched that plan - I couldn't make a deadline to save my life and my pictures were snapshots, not "images".  The only thing I've always done is read a lot and write a lot.  I don't know if I'll ever get #8 aligned with #1, 2 and 4.  If I could, though, it would take care of this octopus business in a big way.  So no matter how much attention or energy I give to anything or anyone, I don't really move or progress in any direction.  Is this how everybody feels?

       Why doesn't "not happy" mean the same as "unhappy"?  They could be synonyms, but they're obviously not equally valid.  It's not fair.

       There are four people in the building (at work) who make more money than I do, and they're all clustered around the circulation desk  complaining about how much money they [don't] make .  While I'm in my office, working.  (I overheard them while practically running past them, delivering something to another office in the process of doing my own job in addition to that of someone else's.)  I've obviously made a serious vocational error somewhere along the line.

       Just took the  urlLink profusely simplified Myers-Briggs Personality Test  at  urlLink SimilarMinds.com .  My personality type is INFP, meaning that I scored roughly equally in each of these four areas:  Introverted (I) 64.86% Perceiving (P) 63.89% Feeling (F) 61.76% Intuitive (N) 60.53%   And roughly equally, but about half as much, in each of these four areas: Sensing (S) 39.47% Thinking (T) 38.24% Judging (J) 36.11% Extroverted (E) 35.14%   The website defines  INFP  in this manner:  "Questor". High capacity for caring. Emotional face to the world. High sense of honor derived from internal values. 4.4% of total population.   It would have been nice to be more of a "thinker," though.

       I'm at work, cataloging a book called  urlLink Not Your Mother's Divorce: A Practical, Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Guide to Surviving the End of an Early Marriage .    What does "surviving" mean?  What does "early" mean?  I just got an email message from my friend Eric.  I've known him since 4th grade.  I had a crush on him off-and-on through junior high and high school, and through college, too.  We stayed in contact all that time even though we didn't really have all that much in common.  He grew up as an only child with money.  His birthday's a year and 15 days before mine but we graduated the same year.  His mom was a kindergarten teacher and she kept him home until he was 6 because she wanted more time with him at home - she always said she would be lonely without him.  (Did that just mean he wasn't ready for school, but she was diplomatic?)  Now he's a cop in our hometown, married to Amy.  She graduated a year after we did, two years after her sister Sara, with whom I was good friends through high school.  They also have a younger brother, Josh, who's now probably 29.  Eric's message was in response to my Christmas card, letting me know what's new with them.  Amy and Eric just had a baby, a son, on December 21.  And Josh started working for the police dept. in our hometown, too.  I'm not sure which makes me more sad, or affects me more.  I don't want to have kids, but the fact that more of my friends are - and of course the fact that Eric did, after all this time, and with Amy (to whom he's been married for several years, and for whom I'm really, really happy) is complicated and sort of difficult but basically a good thing.  But thinking about Josh makes me feel like half of my chest is gone, like a lung's been ripped out and I'm bleeding.  It's trite to say he's 'the one that got away' since anyone who knows me has heard that story about more than just Josh.  But he was something different to me.  He is, for me, what Nick Earls was writing about in  urlLink Perfect Skin : “It’s the shadow I’m standing in, a rock I can’t push past.”  Is it better to know where he is?  Is it better, at least, than when he was in the Marines and I could just imagine him risking getting his head blown off?  Or is it, in this totally selfish way, worse because now if I wanted to, I could find him after ten minutes of searching?    "Surviving the End of an Early Marriage" - huh.

       The across-the-street neighbor just came over to snowblow the driveway.  I'm checking my email and websurfing, and he - around 60 years old, Political Science prof who I call "the evil lawn elf" because he wears a hooded sweatshirt when leaf-blowing in the fall, seemingly making all sorts of noise for very little reason - is risking a heart attack to clean my driveway.  It's not making me rush for my duck boots and scarf to join the fun, but I do feel more guilty than usual.  The snow did come, in earnest.  At least 4" so far.  It would've been awful to drive through.  Sneaking away from my vacation like a scared little girl was actually justified.   urlLink Slightly Married  wasn't bad.  The title was even sort of justified by the story, although only just barely.  To quote a recent television commercial, "it wasn't rocket surgery."  This snowblowing is too much.

       Returned to where I usually live (can't exactly call it "home", both because it doesn't feel like it and because of the second post from yesterday).  Hiding out from - or, more accurately, fleeing in advance of - what's supposed to be a major winter storm.  It'd damned well better be one, since my vacation's a day short now and I'm in a half-cold house with two crazed cats and a ton of dirty laundry.    In a way, it's better than being home.  It just  hurt  to be there.  It hurt to leave, of course.  Always does - I always cry, like a freak, a baby, someone who should know better but doesn't.  I haven't lived there since 1992.  But every time I leave the state after a vacation (even a couple of days) I cry.  It's the only place that's ever felt like a part of me.  But this trip was tough.  I was more melancholy than usual.  Moping.  No one mentioned it, though, so I may have done a decent job of keeping it to myself.  (It's too much ego to imagine that they just don't care enough to notice.)    I read 8 books over the 13 days that I was away.  Certainly would have read more if I'd managed to bring better ones along.   urlLink The House on Eccles Road  by Judith Kitchen has potential but is pretty plodding even for a short book.   urlLink In the Stacks , an anthology of stories about libraries and librarians, is way more esoteric and dull than I'd imagined.  (Why must I give the profession more credit than it deserves?!)  And  urlLink The Dictionary of Failed Relationships  seemed edgy and fun when I read the blurb - in truth, it's sort of trite and lame.  I'm through "D" and have also read "Q" and "T".  (There are 26 stories, one for each letter of the alphabet.)    I want to turn the thermostat up to about 72 degrees, eat sour cream & onion potato chips until I'm very sick of them, and either read my old journals (always good for making myself feel worse, i.e. wallowing in self-pity/disgust/woe) or cry.  Instead, it looks like a night of the  urlLink Food Network  and Mary Balogh's  urlLink Slightly Married .  What a stupid title.

       There's something pathological about coming home when it happens to also be the place where you went to high school  and  college.  Too many memories in one place.  Everywhere I turn around, there's something reminding me of something that I did and shouldn't have done.  Or that I wish I could remember happily, but I'm supposed to forget because it's part of the old life.  Easier said than done.

       The house at 619 Main St. isn't there anymore.  I'm not surprised; it probably burned down.  The last I knew, there was a dryer on the front porch - doesn't seem like a great idea.  But it's gone now.  I'd planned to go around and take pictures of all the houses someday, maybe in black and white.  Have a little scrapbook of the meaningful places I'd been.  Not that I could really share it with anybody, or that if I did share it with anyone, they'd know what I meant when I explained half of the things I'd photographed.  Like 619 Main St., a dump in anyone's estimation.  Just a house, divided into apartments sometime before 1989.  I was in one of them several times that spring.  Stucco ceiling.  Tiny kitchen, right inside the door at the top of the stairs.  Loft.    Pictures can tell a lot, obviously.  What would a picture of a dumpy house on Main St. tell?  Would anyone but me  want  that story told? And now it's gone.  Has anyone else noticed?

       Back to my usual bullet-points.  The weekend seemed very short!  > I met several fascinating men this weekend, at a time when I should have been doing the opposite.  Why does that happen?  Why is it when one is deliberately not looking, interesting people crawl out of the woodwork and insert themselves into one's consciousness?  It's not fair.  > Homemade egg rolls = fantastic!  Without giving too many details, I wasn't able to enjoy them to the extent that I would have liked due to unexpected (well, not entirely unexpected, but certainly unappreciated) discomforts.  And I've never been a wild, whole-hog snarfer of egg rolls in general.  But these things were truly wonderful and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  (Rolled, not yet fried.  Smart, eh?  Thanks, Lori!)  > I need a spring jacket, somewhere between my big, thick wool with toggle buttons monster and my cute Polartec deal that is great for use with sweats or shorts but too schleppy with anything else.  Basically, I need a warm-weather version of my grown-up winter coat for non-winter wear.  I'm thinking of one of the new man-made suede-like fabrics, perhaps in a tan or beige.  I need the Fab Five!  (Or $5000 from Clinton and Stacy, although I'm not willing to give up all of my current clothes for that honor.)   > Topics to not discuss at a party until you're damned sure you're on the same page with everybody present: religion, politics, constitutional amendments, and home-schooling.  It sucks to put your foot in it, particularly when you very much respect the opinion of the person with whom you're speaking.    > Last week was the work week from hell and had certain non-work aspects that were also hellish.  However, it also provided me with some examples of (gasp) ways in which my life is remarkably good.  I shall elaborate:  + I really,  really  love what I do.  Clarification: I love cataloging, and I love collection development in every regard.  Cataloging is an outlet for whatever perfectionism and organization I have.  It's an intellectual puzzle.  Yes, I understand that I don't work for the Library of Congress.  I realize that extending call numbers 12 digits past the decimal point is meaningless and irritating and in many cases even realistically pointless.  But I also love the specificity - there is really, truly a place for everything in the world as understood in those four green and black books.  And I understand it.  I don't know it all by heart, but given enough time (which I have), I can figure it out.  That's damned cool. And collection development is really child's play.  Fun time.  Particularly selection, and then particularly fiction.  But all of it, really.  Acquisitions.  Unpacking the damned boxes, even.  Dealing with in-kind donations and monetary gifts.  Budgeting and planning.  It's an outlet for my creativity and flexibility.  It requires an ability to prioritize not only time and money but also theoretical resources - have we ordered "enough" medical books this year? when we weeded the 800s, did we replace the screenplay-writing items? do we have sufficient funds left to get the new, bestselling but expensive (and not likely to circulate wildly beyond the first 3 months)  Blah Blah  by Mr. Blah?    + The aspects of my job that I don't love are not terrible.  Even processing, about which I've complained too much, isn't so bad.  Now that I've become quite adept at it (as any idiot would with this much practice), it's an opportunity to let my fingers work while my brain can do other things.  I can mull over a sticky area of thesis, or I can sing along with whatever's on the CD player, or I can have a conversation with Trudy.  Or all of the above, while at the same time Vista-foiling paperbacks at the rate of one every five minutes.  (Down from the original 20 minutes, 2 months ago.)  It is, ironically, an outlet for both my perfectionism (lining up edges and pushing out every single bubble) and my creativity (fitting 18 cm paperbacks into 12" Vista-foil sideways rather than using 10" foil and wasting an inch and a half or more).  Who would have thought?  + I've discovered something amazing through the thesis editing process.  My last draft of my thesis - the one that I'd thought was my final draft, until I got the "ahistorical" message and was sent back to the drawing board - was flabby and weak.  It's a hell of a lot better now.  I'm still bitter that my advisor was such a pussy about letting me know about it (i.e. not telling me until taken a day off, I'd driven to Michigan, and shown up in the department office hat in hand expecting to turn the fucking thing in to the grad school so I could goddamned graduate in December).  But it's a  lot  better now.  + My parents are a wonderful pair of people.  If I could pick two people out of the whole universe of potential moms and dads for parents, it would be them.  They didn't give me everything I wanted when I was a little kid, or god knows when I was a teenager and wanted  everything , but they somehow managed to give me what mattered.  Dad would say, "A sense of humor and a clue."  Mom would just laugh and look a little misty.  Since they'll never read this, it doesn't really matter how delicately I put it: I love them to pieces.    + People can really surprise you.  Case in point: there's someone with whom I work who I've always thought was pretty wretched.  I never questioned my opinion that this person (Q) was horrid.  I've talked with others about Q, and they've agreed.  It's been a frequent topic of conversation: Q's horrible personality; taste in clothing, hair, etc.; Q's demanding attitude, and so on.  Frankly, there has been way too much time and space given to the situation.  So something happened about 10 days ago that made me question for the first time whether Q is really all that bad.  In fact, it was as if the scales had been lifted from my eyes.   Q isn't that bad.   In fact, Q is pretty damned good.  A good friend, a decent person, and even - gasp - skilled and talented at Q's job.  So why did I participate in the Q-ripping?  Was it because I lacked the self-esteem to disagree?  Nah.  It was because I'd never even stopped to think about it before.  I let the group make my analysis for me.  And when I actually applied my brain and conscience to it, I realized that Q has never given me a reason to believe the talk.  I shouldn't have.  It's made me treat Q differently and I'm glad of it.  Voila.  Will this week be any better?

       Stephen McCauley, in  urlLink True Enough :  "'If you can't have the person you love, you might as well take the booby prize and have the person who's in love with you.'" : Andy Kudrle.  We were each, at various times in high school, the booby prize.  On one notable occasion when I was incomprehensibly intoxicated I stayed at his house (I'd been visiting a friend in Mpls and she ditched me for a guy - ! - and Andy was kind enough to let me crash at his place), I was passing out on his bed (he slept on the couch) and before I'd let him leave the bedroom I tearfully moaned, "You're the shell on my egg!"  What a nightmare of a memory.  Elizabeth Berg, in  urlLink Never Change :  "'I hate it when this happens.  I hate it when you say something wrong, and suddenly you're in this hole you can't get out of.  And everything you say to try to convince someone of the truth just makes you sound like more of a liar.'"   Andrew Marr.  My first boss from Kaplan, one of the best friends I could ever hope to have.  Somewhere along the line I lost control of things and I don't know if I'll ever manage to make sense of them again.  I miss him more than I could ever explain.  Cathy Coote, in  urlLink Innocents :  "I felt I owned the big hand I held, the big body to which it was attached, the rough cheeks which needed shaving every day, the deep voice.  The strength of your desire made you mine."   This one is both sad and funny: Jim-the-child-molester.  When I worked at Midtown and was 17, there was a guy working there named Jim.  He was very intense and always looked at me (just me?) in a way that seemed somehow more 'intrusive' than other people could look.  He asked me out one day, seemingly out of the blue.  One night we were at the walk-up apartment that he shared with another guy, Kurt, whom I'd known forever and who seemed uncomfortable with my presence but who Jim didn't seem to want me to be around.  We were talking about something totally innocent - graduation, maybe? - and I said I would graduate in '88.  He said he'd graduated in '78.  I asked how old he was and he said, "27".  "YOU'RE 27?!"  "Yes."  "What would my parents say?  What would  your  parents say if they knew that you were dating a 17-year-old?"  Because he knew, you see, how old I was, all along.  "My parents don't have anything to say about it; I'm an adult and make my own choices."  While he made that speech, I was stalking across the room and twisting the locks - the deadbolts and the doorknob - to make my dramatic exit.  Only I didn't know the combination to which locks were open and which weren't, so I was stuck.  He had to let me out.  But I left, and I was disgusted, and I never went out with him again.  And I know that I wasn't the last 17-ish girl he dated - eeeeew.  Joan Silber, in  urlLink Lucky Us , p. 122:  "I had never been secretive before, but my double life felt natural to me.  I had a hidden existence anyway, didn't I...."   BJP.  Some secrets have to remain secret.  But this, too: John Bossy, in  urlLink Christianity in the West, 1400-1700  (I know, that's weird):   "... adultery [is] not a case of the ambiguities of love, but a particularly nasty form of theft."   And this: Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (c. 35-c. 100):  "A liar should have a good memory."   Elizabeth Evans, in 'A New Life,' in  urlLink Suicide's Girlfriend , p. 114:  "I thought about that a lot in the years after, how the littlest thing could make all the difference, turning your head this way instead of that at one moment in your life could decide who you married or whether you lost control on a curve and so on."   Blake Noeske.  My first real boyfriend, if you think of 'real' in the sense of...well, that way.  I was driving to Witoka from Homer Valley with Joel Kudrle (Andy's brother) on a sunny March - April? - day.  Right after school, my senior year.  And as we crested a hill and came around a curve, there was a  vision  on a ten-speed in front of us.  I nearly swerved into the bluff when my lower jaw fell off my face.  "Who   is   that?!"  "That's Blake."  It was obviously meant to be; we stopped and talked with him then.  Joel introduced me, which in retrospect is surprising since they didn't like each other at all.  I ran into Blake at the mall that night and we made plans to go to a movie that weekend.  The next night we ran into each other again.  Neither time did we have any prior knowledge of the other's presence before arriving.  Our relationship made me very happy.  He was grounded from almost the first night.  I lost my head over him, and several friends, and neglected to go to my senior prom.  All because Joel and I happened to be on that one weird country road (where we almost never were) that day (at a time of day when we were almost never out driving), and Joel agreed to introduce me to someone who he didn't think was good enough for me.  Meant to be.  John Burnham Schwartz, in  urlLink Claire Marvel , p. 301:  "The only good thing about your not being here is you can't leave."   I can't explain this yet, but it means something.  This too: Jens Christian Grondahl, in  urlLink Silence in October , p. 237:  "What was it about her that made her such a watershed?  ...  Was it our mutual love of Mark Rothko and Morris Louis, her way of intuiting what I was going to say about them and about everything else we discussed because each of us had thought and felt the same thing?  Was it the remarkable, finely tuned, undisturbed, and noiseless wavelength where we had found each other so easily, because for years we had transmitted on the same frequency without knowing it?"   And this:  Robb Forman Dew, in  urlLink The Evidence Against Her :  "He felt a powerful lurch of being suspended briefly in a moment that is perfect."   This, too: William Shakespeare:    To me, fair friend, you can never be old, For as you were when first your eye I eyed, Such seems your beauty still.  And this: Anne Lamott, in  urlLink Bird by Bird , p. 98:  "Sometimes you run into someone, regardless of age or sex, whom you know absolutely to be an independently operating part of the Whole that goes on all the time inside yourself, and the eye-motes go click and you hear the tribal tones of voice resonate, and there it is -- you recognize them."   Prince, in  urlLink "Automatic" :   "I love the way U kiss me, not with your lips, but with your soul"   Paul Repice.  I think he actually said this to me once at a high school dance.  I don't even think I laughed out loud, which is making me laugh out loud while I type this.    William Shakespeare, in  urlLink Julius Caesar , Act I, Scene ii, lines 198-210:  I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius.  He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks  Quite through the deeds of men.  He loves no plays As thou dost; he hears no music. Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart's ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous.  Mrs. Margaret Kiihne, my 10th grade English teacher.  She led me, without realizing I was being led, to a head-over-heels adoration of Shakespeare and poetry and the written word in general.

I felt the hot tears come; 	Streaming with useless tears, which make the ears roar and the eyelids swell, 	My blind face sought the window-sill 	To cry on - frozen mourning melted by sly sleep, 	Slapping hard-bought repose with quick successive blows until it whimper and 			                       outright weep  My cat, Murfie.

Yup, sleep.  Zzzzzzz.  Me under the covers, him on top.  Me unclothed, him clothed.  It was the  sweetest  thing.  But this reminds me of him, too: Alessandra Montrucchio, in  urlLink Cardiofitness , p. 90:  "...what's beautiful isn't moral."   Not that I believe the quote - it's more of a reminder of the book.  I hadn't really intended this to go this long.  It's an example of how much words and writing mean to me, though.  And I've somehow managed to blow an entire evening on it.  Editing after work, after my haircut, tomorrow.  Dedicated; yeah, right.  I leave you with a thought that will perhaps remind you of someone: "Some people drink from the fountain of knowledge.  Others merely gargle."

       1. How can you love someone and be absolutely furious with them at the same time?  And want what's best for them - and  know  what's best for them - but also want to hit them in the face until they stop talking?  2. I'm indulging myself in the glory of a job offer.  3. I've acquired a new reader.  Well, more like I've gotten off my cyber-ass and taken the time to correspond with someone with whom I'd fallen out of touch for too long.  Someone who has, over the past 16 years - can it be so long? - meant varying things to me.  Classmate, thorn in my side, coworker, topic of conversation, vision of pent-up lust and desire, mutual partygoer, friend, bizarre telephone conversation partner, tormentor with peeled grapes, drinking buddy ( ad nauseam ), ill-fated boyfriend, could have been lover but..., argument partner, scorn victim, topic of conversation, and then (for the last 10 years, I guess), email correspondent, off and on.  More off than on.  Through several living arrangements, email addresses, and jobs.  When I first met him he was pretty cynical.  Maybe even more than I am now.  By the time we were pretty much done spending time together, he was a heart attack waiting to happen.  Really high stress, important job, eating himself up about everything.  So a few days ago I emailed him and apologized for not having written in so long.  (It was me who'd gone too long without writing; he's completely innocent on this charge.)  Rather than telling me I'm a jerk but he'll forgive me, or something along that line, he said that there's nothing really to apologize for.  We live our lives, and we come and go.  Then we come back to each other as friends.  And for a few moments I looked at the screen wondering, "Who stole his email?"  But it came to me that he's been creeping in this direction, gradually, for a while now.  He's becoming - not to put too fine a point on it - Zen about things.  Whether by design or by accident, it's a good thing.  He's not "mellowed".  He's the same Rob, in the sense of being witty and astute and more insightful than maybe I'd prefer sometimes.  But he seems more comfortable in his own skin now.  What an amazing thing, to see someone on the other end of that transition.  4. Taxes are done.  Owe x to the feds, but getting back 2x from Illinois.  Enough to buy another  urlLink bookcase  with the difference.    5. I started reading  urlLink Book Lust  (by Nancy Pearl) the other night after I'd finished editing for the evening.  I'm only about 10 pages into it but I already  love  it.  Some people just  get  the soul of a reader, and she obviously does.    Back to work.

       Well, I'm really, really close to finished with the editing.  I mean, really close.  Naturally, something happened to fuck it all up.  I was online on Saturday night, checking something (I think it was when I was unsure about whether to use commas when referring to months and years, i.e. "January, 1943" - you edit your own work for too long and you forget how to write!) and opened my email.  Wasn't expecting anything, but that's when it shows up, right?    A message from my thesis advisor.  What the hell?!  For those of you who might be new to this gig, my thesis advisor is not a communicator.  No, that's not right.  When I was in grad school, we'd often send 15 or 20 messages back and forth (that's back and forth from Ypsilanti, where he lived/lives, to Ann Arbor, where I lived) about stuff we'd discussed in class, music we both liked (or that one of us liked and the other thought was utter crap), books, philosophy, religion, Star Trek ( lots  about ST: TNG), and beyond.  We were friends.  I'm overemphasizing this because it made what came later seem all the more strange.  When I left Michigan for Illinois, I thought that our friendship, and his mentoring, would follow me.  We remained in contact, somewhat sporadically, off and on for a few years.  Every now and then I'd pop up and restart the thesis process and he'd be just as happy to work with me as ever.  But when I stopped writing, he'd stop writing.  He never initiated  anything .    Even when it became clear (did it ever, really, to him?) that it was going to take about 8 years for me to finish the damned thesis.    So I was just working away on the revisions, scrambling to make sense of the committee's less-than-clear instructions, and checked my email.  The message from him: "It's the middle of the semester, so the committee's wondering how it's going."  Well, that first clause is a direct punch to the face.  The second clause is a question.  So I answered the question...but not until Sunday evening, when I'd calmed down enough to do so without swearing my fingers to the bone.  I explained that chapter 3 was/is more work than expected, and so chapter 5 (directly related in context to chapter 3) is complex, too.  But the rest is done.  He wrote back almost immediately and was fairly glowing with praise.  How  wonderful  to hear from me, how  nice  to know that it's going so  well , how  great  that it'll be done soon.  Fucker.  If he'd written that 6 years ago we wouldn't be in this mess now.  Some "advisor", waiting until this point in the process to give me some goddamned feedback.  So I'm not busting my ass to get done anymore.  It'll happen, eh?  And if it doesn't,  HE  can help me deal with that.  My new best buddy.  Other aspects of my life are littered with enough detritus to make the thesis process seem mild by comparison.  More about that later.

       Not sure if anyone noticed, but the "Thesis Status" indicator on the sidebar is gone.  I decided it was causing me too much stress to look at it when I updated other links and tweaked the template.  I've been slogging through the editing process - and hating every minute of it - but it's not going well.  I have to finish it by Wednesday.  Here's my week so far: Monday: work 8:30 (or so) to 5:00 Tuesday: dentist at 8:10, work from 9:00 to 5:30  (or whenever I get there until 8.5 hours later) Wednesday: work from 8:00 (if I can manage it) until my parents arrive around noon.  Lunch at the  urlLink Coffee Gourmet .  They were planning to come back to my house afterward and wait until I get home from work, but how lame is that?!  I'll just take off when they arrive.  I think we'll have the inevitable "Could you please start paying back the $##,### that you owe us before we want to retire in December?" during the afternoon. Thursday: breakfast at Egg Haven, the new restaurant that has bacon waffles -  oh my god , what an amazing concept - with Mom & Dad, and then off to work until...I'm done.  At least 8.5 hours later. Friday: work 8:30 to 5:00, followed by a staff meeting from 5:00 until at least 6:30.  We're not having one in March, so this will be a long and painful one.  Among the topics are "Why we're no longer going to buy videos" (because "no one" has VCRs anymore) and "Why it's the circulation staff's responsibility to look at donations before they bring them to tech services" (because if they bring me one more bag of moldy 1960s encyclopedias or worn paperbacks with garage sale stickers on them, I'll kill them in a slow and painful way, that's why).   Saturday: don't ask. Sunday: homemade spring rolls & egg rolls at Lori & Geoff's.  Heaven!  So, my point was, if I'm going to get my damned thesis done, I need to do it this weekend - tonight and tomorrow.  'Cause the EMU grad school deadline is 15 March, and that's only about a month (CRAP, 3 weeks) away.  And I obviously will not have any time to work on it this week.  Tomorrow or nothing.  Hmm.  Maybe I'll take Monday off and work on it then, and mail it on Tuesday on my way to work after the dentist.  Nothing like doing all my pain in one day.  All I have to do, really, is go through chapters 4 and 5 for minor errors.  That shouldn't take more than an hour total.  And then chapter 6, which should maybe take 2 hours, for more serious revision of the "ahistorical" issue, which really was blown quite out of proportion upon further review.  (Although since I wasn't overly fond of it in the first place, who am I to complain about having the opportunity to change it?)  That just leaves me with chapter 3, with which I've been struggling.  I'm supposed to make it "less about Germany and Italy, and more about Spain."  Easier said than done, particularly at this juncture.  Sigh.  No choice now, though.    No rest for the wicked.  Y'all may not hear from me until it's done, but then, it'll be done and you probably won't shut me up.  Think good thoughts, send positive vibes, and pray if you're of that ilk.

       I read the following review while wearing my collection development/selection hat earlier this week at work.  Considering some of the blog-and-comment discussions that have been flying recently, it might be of interest to more than just me.  Title:  urlLink Necessary Dreams : Ambition in Women's Changing Lives  Author: Anna Fels   Available 6 April 2004 from Pantheon Books, $26.00.    From  urlLink Publishers Weekly : "While a psychiatrist's study of the 'vital role of ambition in women's changing lives' hardly sounds like absorbing reading, this book by Fels, an occasional science writer for the  New York Times  and other popular media, is surprisingly interesting. After introductory comments about how life has changed for modern women, thanks to increased longevity, birth control and other factors, Fels raises a curious question: why do women still feel anxious or evasive about admitting to having ambitions, but men don't? The answer lies in understanding that ambition has two components: the mastery of some specific skills and the recognition of that mastery by others. While many professions have opened to women in the 20th century, allowing them to learn a variety of skills, Fels says, women have still not found a plethora of sources for recognition, or ways of being valued by others for the special skills they've acquired. Lacking 'sustaining affirmation,' women sometimes settle for mere attention -- sexual attention being the easiest -- or 'recognition by proxy,' reflected glory from the accomplishments of husband or children. Men, on the other hand, Fels finds, have traditionally had a wide range of sources -- colleagues, mentors, friends, family, spouse -- for 'affirming attention.' As Fels examines the mixed messages women get about claiming recognition (especially the taboos on outshining one's husband or appearing less than devoted to child-rearing), women readers may see their own goal problems more clearly. This book isn't sexy, nor is it self-help, but career women -- or anyone raising smart daughters to do big things -- will find a lot within its pages to think about and discuss.

       I'm not a technophobe.  I've used email for 13 years, owned at least one computer for longer than that, and have a more than working knowledge of Macs and PCs.  I decided that I wanted to start a blog and later that day, I had one.  It's not as if I'm in the woods contemplating my navel, unaware of the world and what it has to offer.  But I was stunned at the results of a Google search of my blog title (plus a little identifying information, thanks to the relatively annoying habit that bloggers have of using "get it all down" in posts, thank you very little).  All I'd wanted to know was if the blog itself was indexed anywhere other than at  urlLink dmoz , which is an open directory that's self-edited (apparently, people who care to do so will add appropriate sites to the index, so that others who use the directory can find them).  Both Jenica's and my blogsites are on the  urlLink "Reference: Libraries: Library and Information Science: Weblogs: Personal Weblogs" page .  That's not so surprising; Jenica has oodles of links and with lots of library people linking to each other, someone who adds to dmoz is bound to find us.  But I was amazed to see how far that's gone.  The dmoz site is replicated (well, copied, anyway) all over the place.    So I've been handily pigeon-holed as "Illinois Library Cataloger Amy Writes as Fast as She Can."  Ha ha ha.  Not quite.  The quotation isn't something that I take as  instruction , but rather as  philosophy .  I think writing for pleasure (and this is the only thing that I'm doing that qualifies, right now) requires a certain discipline - if it's in you, get it out so you can generate more.    Here's what that unequivocally means:  I am  NOT  writing as fast as I can .  No one would read everything I had to say, if I wrote it all down.  Trust me.  I guarantee it.  I don't even know if blogspot would host it for free anymore.    But now I'm thinking about the purpose, politics, and ethics of blogging.  Who really is reading what I'm writing?  When I planned this, and when it started, my audience was a finite number of identifiable people.  Now it's those people (minus a few who apparently can't be bothered), plus some of their friends, plus some who've found the site through them, plus some who've found the site through dmoz.  Maybe some who've stumbled on it from the  urlLink Blogger  homepage and the "recently published blogs" list.  Yeah, I'll admit to some desire to make the "Blogs of Note" list on the Blogger homepage.  Part of it is ego (duh), but it's also trying to retain a sense of purpose and continuity.  I didn't intend this to be a rambling journal of crappy, self-indulgent bullshit that only people who knew me really well would care about, or that I would be terribly embarrassed by if I ever stopped to think about what I was writing.  The point (if I should even be making it this overtly) is the writing.    That brings up the politics.  Now that I know that it's not just my initially-projected audience that I'm reaching, do I need to think about what I publish before I do so?  Should I be more careful about being candid about, e.g., my colleagues at other institutions?  I decided right away that if I was in for a penny, I was in for a pound as far as my job goes, so there was no point in being too cute with who was being ripped apart.  I've been relatively careful about handing out the address and someone finds it and takes offence, they need to look at themselves and consider the possibility that there could be more than one truth.  I do not lie by commission.  (Take that for what it's worth.)    But there are more far-reaching issues, like the rant on the degradation of the English language from 14 January.  There's no mystery, if one works in this geographic area, about whom I referred.  Particularly since I used the full name of one of the culprits.  There could be ramifications (albeit not official) if that were discovered by someone in a position of power over me.  Now that I'm aware of the possibility (or even probability?), should I excise the name, or alter it to protect myself?  Or should I accept the risk?  This is an easy one and doesn't require any consultation of my class notes from undergrad Moral Theory.  I accept the risk.  I wrote that post in the vain hope that someone who knew one of them would read it and bring it to their attention.  Maybe it's the anti-bravery, inverse backbone, insensible stubbornness, but I'll stand up for the little (and correct!) guy in this little way.  Even if it means that bonehead EK might find out that I think she's a bonehead and a menace to all things good and right about libraries in Illinois.  Oh, did I do it again?  Oops.    I'm going to try to turn this self-consciousness about  Who's Watching Me?  into a more general, blase' self-awareness.  If that's the only change, it'll have been a positive discovery.

       This seems to be the week for divulging little tidbits of slightly embarrassing information about myself, and tonight's post shall not disappoint.  The reason that I was so excited about the idea of a New Zealander reading my blog is that I love European golf.  Confused?  Not for long.  When I was in grad school (i.e. actually attending classes on campus in  urlLink Ypsilanti, Michigan ) I was under a great deal of stress and not dealing with it well at all.  I had, for reasons that may perhaps be clear, stopped drinking alcohol and that didn't seem to be helping (although it probably  was  helping and I didn't realize it).  Most of my classes were at night because EMU is a commuter school (and the MA program is designed primarily for teachers seeking Masters degrees so they can increase their pay - tres academic, eh?), so I'd be home in the morning and afternoon with nothing to do but study and...watch TV.  So I'd watch...TV.  And what's on TV in the morning that's tolerable?  Hmmm.  Well, in 1994, that would be the  urlLink Golf Channel !  It was brand-new and extremely cool and telecast the  urlLink PGA-European Tour  events live.  For those of you with no international imagination, that equates to around 7:00 AM-10:00 AM Eastern Time.  So I'd watch  urlLink Renton Laidlaw  and  urlLink Peter Oosterhuis  do the color commentary and play-by-play for these fascinating, historic golf events at beautiful old courses around Europe (and Asia and Australia, but that's another story).   I've always liked watching golf on TV.  It's soothing, and if something interesting happens, they'll undoubtedly show it again.  And European golf is very "quirky" - they yap a lot with the players and show their wives and girlfriends and stuff.  I fondly remember Renton waxing rhapsodic about the potato salad at the venue in Sweden for the Scandinavian Masters.    You might be asking yourself, why would she watch European golf?  Who even plays on that tour?  Who have I heard of?  Well, there are the household names - Jose Maria Olazabal, of course (1994 and 1999 U.S. Masters champion), and Nick Faldo, and Bernhard Langer (who shares my birthday and who is allegedly married to a woman from Sycamore, Illinois).  And then there are the Europeans who may not be well-known to those in the United States but who are popular in Europe, like Paolo Quirici from Switzerland or Thomas Bjorn of Denmark.  But the really interesting ones are the "rest of the world" players - those like Vijay Singh, who come from weird places like Fiji without a golfing tradition, or from really cold places (ok, no good examples) or those from... (aha, here's the connection) New Zealand.  And from there hails my favorite golfer of all time,  urlLink Frank Nobilo .  I could blather on about his piratical heritage or his T4 in the Masters or his mysterious back ailment or getting bonked in the head with a golf ball on his honeymoon after his ill-fated (in my opinion) second marriage.  But I'll just say this: he's stunning to look at, and he has a sweet swing.  That is why I like the idea of New Zealand, and New Zealanders reading my blog.  Some intellectual I am, huh?  Tee hee.

       Would you eat a chocolate-flavored product called "String-o-Bean" that provided 100% of the recommended daily allowance of the vitamins and minerals your body needs to be strong and healthy?  How about cinnamon-flavored?  Pretzel?  Why do some things sound so incredibly funny in your head and then not so funny in print?  Should it matter to me that my blog is being read by people from other countries?  Maybe not, but it is, and it does.  I find it both hilarious and kind of weird.  Not creepy-weird, but cool weird.  Like, little-old-me, aw-shucks-ish.    How do I know from whence the blog-readers hail?  Click on the little checkmark icon at the bottom of the page.  It'll open a new page for nedstatbasic, which is a free counter service.  It lists the number of times my blog has been checked since 13 Feb., which is when I set up the counter.  It also lists the country of origin for the ISP from which my page was accessed.  As of this time, 95.9% of viewers have been from the U.S.  2.1% (3) have been from the UK, 1.4% (2) from New Zealand (that is so amazing), and .7% (1) from the Netherlands.  How did they find me?  What made Greg Maddux sign with the  urlLink Cubs ?  Will it make a radical difference to this year's team?  Or will having a legitimate pitching star on the staff throw a monkey wrench in the works, when part of the mojo for the last couple of years has been the "uncharted territory" and "lack of expectations" thing?  Will I ever finish my taxes?

       I've always wanted to... write an advice column.  When I was on lunch today (from 2:00-2:30) the library's large meeting room looked like... Barbie/Tonka Hell.  (Alternate version: Wal-Mart disgorged its toy aisles from a height of 1000 ft., along with 10 bags of Cheddar Goldfish.)  When in doubt or half asleep, I wear... blue, preferably cornflower.  It brings out my eyes, apparently, which are the only positive memory that I have of my maternal grandfather.  An embarrassing thing to admit these days... is that I'm from Minnesota, damn it, so I know it doesn't pay for me to get all worked up about national politics yet; whomever I get attached to will lose anyway.  See, e.g., Mondale & Dukakis.  I'll wait until the thing heats up on a more country-wide scale, thanks, before I even identify the teams.  The sentences that most effectively rendered me silent... came from Bill of "Marry Me Bill" fame.  I broke up with him by taking the easy way out - writing him a letter - immediately before leaving for two weeks in Cocoa Beach, FL.  I thought he'd have moved on to some chippy on his own level (ahem) long before I returned.  Alas, I was sleeping the night I got back and  he broke into the house  - into Maureen and Jim's house! - and crept downstairs to the bed where I was sleeping, woke me up by poking my foot and saying, "Aim.  Aim.  Aim.  Aim."  I thought it was a very annoying nightmare.  It was Bill, and I was awake.  Damn it.  Once I was truly awake and yelling - albeit whispering - "GET OUT, YOU IDIOT!" he said, "Calm down.  Stop talking."  I stopped talking, amazed that he sounded so, I don't know, not stupid, I guess.  I looked at him.  He looked at me.  Took a deep breath.  Stuttered a bit, then said, all in a rush, "I know you didn't mean to break up with me, you'd been really sick and on penicillin and you were out of your head with that cold, I know we really had something special, I know you didn't mean it so I've decided to let it go this time, I forgive you, we can get back together."  You forgive me?  Say what?!  Yeah, I couldn't say anything.  I just gaped at him, and he kissed me on the forehead and left.  (I'll bet you're wondering how I managed to finally get rid of him....)  The best band you've never heard of... is Hunters & Collectors.  What I want most right now is... for the processing snafu to be solved.   PROBLEM: There is no one person to do the job of "processing clerk".   POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:  1. Hire person A or person B, both of whom have applied for the position and have interviews scheduled.   2. Hire person C, who has previously expressed interest in the position but has since expressed reluctance to apply.   3. Screw hiring altogether, cajole the boss into increasing me to full time status, and doing the goddamned job myself and not dealing with the posting, accepting applications, interviewing, declining, hiring, and training crap.   POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS: 1. Person A has expressed no interest in the position itself, just in the flexibility that it offers.  Person B has expressed no interest in the position itself, just in the hours and pay that it offers. 2. Person C has reasons to take or not take the job that have nothing to do with the job, and I don't want to push.  I know it's inappropriate and unfair to push.  But I also feel a little pinched because I was responding to C's request for information when we talked about the job.  And I HAVE TO fill the fucking position.  Because I'm SO sick of doing it myself, and I HATE thinking about the possibility of having to keep doing it or to post it externally.  I just want to have the thinking about it part of it DONE with already.   3. I'm already busy, stressed, tired, and stretched thin enough.  I don't need another 5.5 hours a week of work to add to it.  I'm already at least a day behind on getting my damned thesis to Michigan.  This was not supposed to be the job I'd have for the rest of my life.  Why am I even thinking of making it full time?!  The thing I like to eat that most people don't like to eat... is a tie between Circus Peanuts and Apple Jacks.  No, I don't eat them at the same time.  My dream car... is a 2-seater Jaguar.  Or an MG Midget.  Although I knew a man with an Alfa Romeo Spyder once....

       1.  Mondays suck .  2. If Alex Rodriguez is the best player in baseball, why have the teams he's played on not appeared in the playoffs?  Is he actually worth the money he's paid?  I don't think so.  3. There are very few things that taste better on a sucky Monday evening than a grilled ham and cheese sandwich and a little glass bottle of Coke.  4. This afternoon, I needed a list of items that were purchased with funds from the LSTA grant that I wrote last year.  I knew it was on my desk (at work) somewhere.  I had to dig through 2 bins and 3 stacks of stuff - books, DVDs, sheets of barcodes, review journals, scraps of paper with nonsensical numbers jotted on them, pink slips (a highly formalized system of recordkeeping which, for all intents and purposes, is making up for the fact that I spent more than a year working for the library while I was in law school retroactively converting about 8000 books into a system that wouldn't load into Innovative...so none of those items are in the NIC catalog now.  So when someone checks one of them out, the barcode scans as "not in system".  Pink slip is completed and turned in to Tech Services.  We input a record and wait for the book to come back.  When it does, we decide whether to keep it.  Imperfect, but we're getting by.), applications, Demco and Showcases catalogs, etc.  It took about 15 minutes to find one piece of legal pad paper.  My desk isn't a square acre or anything, just a regular, crappy, institutional desk.  Must clean!  Tomorrow!  5. I get more done when there's no one around than I could ever think of getting done when there's another person in the room.  For one thing, there's no illusion of being organized, and I don't have to remember not to swear.  Has anyone noticed that I swear?  Yeah, I swear.  6. When I started writing my thesis I thought I was an idiot and that every word I wrote was crap.  As time went on, I realized that I'm actually brilliant, and most of what I write is inspired and thoughtful and worthy of publication.  Certainly it's no wonder that I won first prize in the 1999 Nathan Burkan Memorial Competition at ASCAP (the American Society of Composers, Authors & Publishers).  Now that I'm spending the majority of my conscious hours when I'm not slogging away at the salt mines that are SPL editing my own pabulum in response to my committee's harangues, however, I acknowledge that I was much closer to the truth when I began.  One out of every ten words that I've written in my thesis is easily strikable.  Another one is debatable.  And maybe three of the remaining eight are pretty good.  S'not so bad.  7. Nothing like the tenth migraine in twelve days to give me perspective on life.  8. Valentine's Day sucks like the vortex of a thousand Mondays.  9. Eddie Bauer was having a catalog sale and I was going to buy something.  Didn't really care what, just wanted to buy  something .  Opened the catalog, looked through it, and found... two things.  First, a leather messenger bag.  Gorgeous, brown, not overly distressed but not too grown-up looking, either.  Definitely not a briefcase (eew).  But the strap was miniscule and I knew I'd blow it out the first time I tried to schlep more than a couple CDs back to work on the same day that I brought in cookies to share.  For $195 it should look like it would stand up to Rubbermaid.  Sigh.  So, onto the second item - a pair of linen pants.  Loose, flowy, plain waist and rather wide legs for me but not super huge and sloppy-looking.  With a cardigan they might even look dressyish.  (!)  $59.  No crime.  Offered in flax and black.  I pulled them up on the website and looked at them for a long time, alternate views, larger picture, each color, on a model....  Nope.  Couldn't do it.  I can't even waste money to cheer myself up anymore.  Booo.  10. What's the difference between being open and feeling the need to confess?  Is anyone going to tell you, anymore, when you've done the latter rather than living up to the former?

       Songs that remind me of specific people:  * "The Sign" by Ace of Base - I had a friend in grad school (he went to the University of Michigan) named John Gomez.  He was from San Antonio and loved music by Metallica and Pantera (we'd do the Pantera claw thing as a greeting to each other).  But he really liked "The Sign" and used to sing it all the time, and it would just slay me to see this kind of diminutive Latino guy dancing around and singing with a Swedish group.     "I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  I saw the sign"   * "I'm Every Woman" by Whitney Houston - This is actually what brought up the idea for this posting.  My first boss at Kaplan was Andy Marr.  He was a very, very good-looking guy.  Wore great suits and always had nice haircuts and stuff - took good care of himself.  He was a big fan of Elton John.  I can't even tell you the extent of his love for Elton John's music.  But anyway, Andy handled all the stuff at the office requiring any physical work, like changing the lightbulbs over my desk, and one day he was standing on my desk changing bulbs (those really long fluorescent ones) and "I'm Every Woman" came on the radio.  He was singing along and dancing, using the bulb as a microphone, and suddenly said, "Thank God no one else is seeing me do this, because I'd never hear the end of it."  It was beyond hilarious and I can still see every element of that scene in my mind.     "Whatever you want  Whatever you need  Anything you want done baby  I'll do it naturally  Cause I'm every woman  It's all in me"   * "Joy & Pain" by Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock - My first job was in the bakery at Midtown Foods (the grocery store).  I worked there from when I was barely 16 until I was 20.  Along the way I met many good friends there (and many transient ones... that's a story for another time), including Diane Beisel.  She started as a clerk but eventually started doing accounting in the morning, so I saw her when I came in early to bake bread or fry donuts.  We were the same age and both went to Winona State so we started to spend time together.  I was there for the Pauly period and she unfortunately had to deal with the Russ incident and aftermath, and also Chris in the livingroom with the underwear on the wall.  But that's all beside the point, which is that we'd often have parties at which we'd listen to music, and "Joy & Pain" was popular then.  (It was during that period when incredibly sheltered "white folk" started to listen to rap and hip hop music with impunity.)  And Diane, for reasons that remain unclear to me,  loved  this song.  She knew every word and would sing (loudly and not too well) and dance (if one can dance loudly, she did, but with more skill than she sang) and basically lose herself in it.  It was extremely funny.  And that's the reason that when I hear "Joy & Pain" I think of a really fair-skinned young woman from White Bear Lake.   "Used to be friends but now we're foes  Ask me why, man, no one knows  Maybe jealousy between you and me  Could be the fame, could be the money  I'm goin' for mine and I don't really care  Cuz the spotlight Rob Base don't share  I'm the headliner of this show  And you're just a kid and you need to grow"   "Midnight" by Yaz - Oof, this is a hard one.  One of my very good friends in high school was Sara Squires.  One of our shared interests was music, and for my 17th birthday (I think?) she gave me a mix tape called "The Aim Mix" ('cause she called me Aim, which is both short for my name, duh, and also a play on how she'd write it, which was the inverted V of the A with a horizontal arrow for the line).  On the mix was "Midnight", the first song I'd ever heard from Yaz.    Around that time, I was spending a lot of time at work with a guy (SP) who went to the other high school in town.  We did a lot of stuff that I probably should've "explain[ed] in detail on a separate page" of the moral character and fitness section of my bar exam application.  We stole a decent percentage of the political signs from town.  We "borrowed" those reflector things (metal pole about 3' high, little round reflector at the top) from the ends of driveways and left them all at the end of some appointed driveway at the end of our travels for the day.  In perhaps our finest, lowest point, we drove past a Big Wheel that some poor schleppy kid had left in the street, and took it.  We took a kid's Big Wheel!  We rationalized that he shouldn't have left it in the street.  We put it in the hatchback of my car.  Around two weeks later, we figured he'd learned his lesson, and we gave it back.  If my parents ever looked in my car for any reason and found things like 50 Arne Carlson for Governor signs or a Big Wheel, they were probably horrified but not enough to actually ask.  Ignorance is bliss.  And that, unfortunately, segues nicely into the point of this rumination.  SP and I had a lot of fun together and I liked him a lot.  I wish there was some way for me to graphically illustrate the extent of "a lot".  I think I was in love.  No, that's not right.  I was.  in love.  with him.  And I was incredibly naive, so I assumed that it would be ok to tell him that I cared about him or something along that line.  I don't remember what I said.  Something about there being a string between us and feeling like anytime he wanted something from me he had only to give the gentlest tug and I was right there to do whatever he wanted, and wanting to know that he felt the same tug.  He was surprisingly (as I think back on it now) gentle but honest, and he told me that we were only friends.  Well, he lied at that, because friends don't spend that kind of time together doing those kinds of things, but anyway, that's that.  I should be grateful that he was honest.  Only my heart was smashed in the treads of his size 13s.  And I drove home crying, sure that I wouldn't survive, and if by some mistake I did, I'd never hurt so much over anything ever again.  The tape from Sara was in the tape-player and the song "Midnight" by Yaz came on and filtered into my consciousness and will always remind me of that feeling and of him.   "and now it's midnight it's raining outside  and i'm soaking wet, still looking for that man of mine  and i ain't found him yet  well all of this rain can wash away my tears  but nothing can replace all of those wasted years  in all of this i tell you i have learnt  playing with fire gets you burnt  and i'm still burning"   * "Wedding Bell Blues " by the 5th Dimension - Yeah, this is going to sound pretty weird.  But I've got to explain something rather tangential for background to this one.  I went to college in my hometown, starting when I was barely 18.  I lived at home my first school year and part of the summer.  Less than halfway through the summer I sub-let a house from a good friend for $75/mo.  Her roommates went a little nuts not too long after, though, and I moved out.  I needed a place to live (staying at home was cramping my style) and I was whining to my friend Maureen, a married woman with kids with whom I worked.  She'd just had a huge fight with her husband and wasn't feeling too charitable toward him, so she said, "Why don't you stay in our basement?"  I wasn't shy or willing to look a gift-horse in the mouth, so I moved in about a week later.  I stayed in their basement, which had a separate entrance off the alley, but otherwise lived with them.  (Bathroom upstairs, etc.)  Around that time I was still working at the bakery and getting to know the new dishwasher, Bill.  He was a rugby player.  I'd never known anyone who played rugby and thought it was barbaric and, secretly, extremely sexy.  He thought I was a stuck-up intellectual snob (because I was a history major and didn't know anyone who played rugby).  We antagonized each other constantly.    He left for Christmas break and all was well until New Years' Eve.  I was home alone; Maureen and family had gone to visit relatives.  The phone rang.  It was Bill.  He'd returned from Melrose Park or whatever Chicago suburb he lived in, early, because he couldn't get me out of his mind.  He knew he had no right to ask and no reason to think I'd be available, but would I go out with him for New Years'?  I was thrilled.  It was very exciting.  We went to a party and had a great time and it was all very "wrong side of the tracks" and fun.  We spent the rest of Break together and it was a good time.  When school started again it wasn't as fun - in fact, it was kind of weird.  My friends were sort of studious and quiet compared to his, who were always bloody and skipping class.  We had nothing in common.  But he hung around me constantly (when the bars were closed - he was 21 and I wasn't yet).  Maureen, who had a song for every occasion and was always running around the house singing musicals, found the whole thing unendingly funny, and rather than saying "I told you so", she would just sing this song, which I will always associate with her.   "...marry me Bill  I love you so, I always will And though devotion rules my heart I take no bows  But Bill you're never gonna take those wedding vows Oh, come on Bill Oh, come on Bill Come on and marry me Bill I got the wedding bell blues Please marry me Bill I got the wedding bell blues Marry me Bill"   There are more, but that ties it up so nicely that there's no reason to go on with this.

       I'm editing, and I found a quotation in a footnote that I absolutely love, but that I finally acknowledge doesn't belong in my thesis.  David Lloyd George was Prime Minister of Great Britain in the 1920s.  As such, he was often required to negotiate with Eamon de Valera in various capacities (he was eventually Taoiseach, or PM, of Ireland - eventually called the Irish Free State, then Eire).  Owen Dudley Edwards, the great Irish scholar, wrote in his 1987 biography   urlLink Eamon de Valera  , "Lloyd George...stated that negotiating with de Valera was like trying to pick up mercury with a fork, on being told of which de Valera... inquired, 'why doesn't he use a spoon?'" (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1987), 97.   De Valera's a fascinating character - obtuse and charismatic.  If I could go out for a beer with 5 historical figures, he'd be one of them.  (Likewise Kennedy, Harry Hopkins, Aristotle - so he could perhaps explain to me what he was @!#$ing writing about, and Martin Luther.)

       From  urlLink Shape  magazine, March 2004 issue, p. 30:   "If you want your writing to sound intelligent, leave the thesaurus on the shelf and stick to the simplest words to get your point across.  Writers who use basic vocabulary are viewed as smarter than those who choose complicated, multisyllable words when shorter ones would do, according to a study by Daniel M. Oppenheimer, a graduate student in cognitive psychology at Stanford University in California.  'The longer and more complex the words, the harder something is to read and comprehend, so people like it less and think the author is less intelligent,' he says."  This is both hard to believe and counterintuitive.  The article doesn't give a citation to the original study, so I decided to try to find more information.  I'm not a reference librarian, so my first choice is usually (and always, when I'm at home)  urlLink Google , so that's where I went.  With "vocabulary daniel oppenheimer stanford" as my search terms, I got 213 hits in .25 seconds.  The first was a reference to an  urlLink article  in  urlLink NZoom , New Zealand Health News, about the study itself.  There's definitely more to it than the above paragraph indicated.  "'I think it's important to point out that this study is not about problems with using long words--it's about problems with using long words needlessly,' Oppenheimer said.  'If the best way to say something involves using a complex word, then by all means do so. But if there are several equally valid ways of expressing your ideas, you should go with the simpler one,' he noted."  Ah.  I feel better.  I'd still like to get the whole story, but it could be a while.  So far, the results of the study aren't published; Oppenheimer gave the paper at the recent Society for Personality and Social Psychology conference.

       Tara and I decided this morning  no, I shouldn't say that.  We were talking on the phone, and  I  said that I wouldn't be able to resist a man wearing bacon cologne.  She said it would have to be a man in whom she was already interested.  For me, the bacon would make the man.  I know that scientists have studied the effects of various scents on emotional responses and determined that a woman utilizing the scent of cinnamon rolls can make a man do almost anything.  But I wonder if they've ever tried bacon on women?

       OK, so I was in the restroom when I thought of these things, but Everybody Does It.  (I read that on a book cover someplace.)  1. There are way too many feminine hygiene ads on TV these days.  Dennis Miller once said, in a comedy sketch, "These women have more periods than a Hemingway novel."  That makes me laugh even in my head, when I think it as I type it.  2. JCrew and Victoria's Secret often name their colors after fruits and veggies and other foods.  One of my favorite clothing items is a JCrew turtleneck in "basil".  Two color names one should never see Victoria's Secret use: Squash and Pea.

        February 1989  15 years ago, I: 1. Was 18 years old and unbelievably immature.  I'm looking at my journal from that time and it's nearly too horrible to explain.   2. Didn't have a serious boyfriend.  But I spent time with ...a decent chunk of the male population of  urlLink Winona, Minnesota .  Judging by what's in the journal, much of the time was spent in Banger's Pub.  And Mingle's Fundrinkery.  And at "some guy's apartment who worked at Midtown".  ( urlLink Midtown Foods IGA  was a grocery store that employed about 200 locals between 16 and 25, myself included.  It was a meat market in more ways than one.)    3. Was a photojournalism major and intended to be a sports photographer.  I wanted to live in Boston. 4. Drove a  urlLink 1980 Plymouth Horizon  with a silver and black exterior and a burgundy interior.  It was a piece of crap body with a VW Rabbit engine.  I treated it badly but it was obviously charmed. 5. Lived in the basement at 262 Walnut St. with Maureen & Jim and their 3 kids, Nathan, Emily and Daniel.  Nathan just lost his license for aggravated DUI after suspension; Emily's a single mom; Daniel's the cutest kid ever (although "kid" for a 26-year-old dates me more than anything else I've ever said). 6. Had Murfie (a Maine Coon, etc.), who lived at Mom & Dad's.  She'd been mine since I was 12 and my brother brought her and Herman home from my uncle's farm, buttoned into his jean jacket,  on his motorcycle .  Their mother had been killed and they were too little to care for themselves.  We were going to keep them "only until they were big enough to go back to the farm".  Herman was hit by a car on my 13th birthday.  Murfie was extremely fluffy - she looked like a sheep from the belly down.  She lived to be 9. 7. Wore my hair to mid-back length with mouth-length bangs hanging over my left eye.  Not as much makeup as one might expect, but I can't really pull it off with this pale skin anyway.   February 1994  10 years ago, I was 23 and: 1. Lived in  urlLink Ann Arbor, Michigan , which I hated with a  passion . 2. Worked at  urlLink Kaplan Educational Center  as the Office Manager.  I'd been hired as an Enrollment Counselor about 10 months before the promotion.  It was the first job of several that I've had where I was hired in one position but gently massaged my way into a position I liked better.  "Enrollment Counselor" = salesperson, and what I was selling was $500+ prep classes for standardized tests.  Once I became Office Manager, I spent my time making sure we had class space, sufficient books and other supplies, qualified teachers, etc.  It was a good job and I was really, really good at it. 3. Was about 7 months from starting my graduate work at  urlLink Eastern Michigan University , home of my ill-fated thesis.  Yes, the same one.   4. Wore my hair to my waist in  urlLink Julia Roberts- Pretty Woman  spiral curls , dressed up with the 27" waist black-watch plaid schoolgirl skirt that I wore maybe once a week for a year.  Ugh. 5. Had had Pooke & Hobbes for 5 years.  Had adopted them from my friend Tammy Schnell (Angaran) in October, 1989 when they were 6 weeks old.  Originally planned to take one - Pooke.  But when I went to pick her up, Tammy handed me a tiny, squawking gray bundle and said, "Hold this."  She went to get Pooke.  When she came back, she said, "That's the one that nobody wants.   She's going to the farm ."  Naturally, I left with two.  Best snap decision I ever made.  6. Spent money as fast as I made it, in an effort to not be miserable in A2.   February 1999  5 years ago, I was 28 and: 1. Had moved to  urlLink Sycamore, Illinois , and was in my third year at  urlLink Northern Illinois University   urlLink College of Law . 2. Was working as a graduate assistant in the  urlLink Physical Therapy Department  at NIU, getting a tuition waiver and making a stipend to make photocopies and answer the telephone once a week. 3. Received my  urlLink MPRE  (Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination) score, from the test that I took in November.  It's the first test that one takes on the way toward passing the  urlLink bar .  In Illinois, a scaled score of 80 is required for passing.  I scored 102. 4. Heard from my friend Meg that the  urlLink Sycamore Public Library  might be looking for someone to work in Tech Services soon, because Ruthie was planning to leave for greener pastures.  "Hmm," I thought, "perhaps I can work there temporarily, while I study for the bar exam."   5. Wore my hair in Julia Roberts-Pretty Woman spiral curls, but dressed down considerably by my jeans with holes in the knees.   February 2002  2 years ago, I was 31 and: 1. Was living in a condo the size of a bathroom stall while looking for a house to buy, and was damned sick of the entire process.  Had looked at 21 dwellings of various levels of quality before finding "the one". 2. Still worked at that "temporary" job (although I hadn't really mentioned it being temporary when I accepted it) of Head of Technical Services at the Sycamore Public Library 3. Had periodically picked up and set down my thesis (and revised chapter one so many times that it should've been the Great American Chapter by then), to the point that I'd finally filed for an extension so that I wouldn't lose credit for the classes I'd taken at EMU.  Progress.... 4. Was in  urlLink physical therapy  because my neurologist had finally determined that the muscles in my neck were causing some of the migraines that I was having (up to 4 days a week).   5. Had made a real friend, not so long before, that I was tentatively learning how to treasure.  We had been acquaintances first, at work, and then sort of friends in a way that I'm not sure either of us really remember.  And then there's a flurry of memories, for me anyway, capped off with her standing next to my desk saying, "I'm not sure why I'm telling you this, but I'm leaving my husband.  I just had to tell you."  It was a burden and a gift at once: the burden of handling a difficult situation correctly, of course, and the gift of being  the one to be trusted .  It was unlike the stereotypical friendships from before (backstabbing shit from high school where we surruptitiously kissed each others' boyfriends just 'cause we could get away with it, or vague college meaningless drinking amiability, or law school back-scratching networky stuff that made my eyeballs bleed).  It was more delicate than I deserved and I was, and am, in awe. (6. Hair - still too long, still too curly.)   February 2003  1 year ago, I was 32 and: 1. Was still working at SPL, more often thinking "What the fuck am I doing here?"  Really questioning my devotion to a career that I haven't been educated for, when there are two for which I have but to which I'm not devoted.  Questioning working my ass off for far too little pay, even though I love what I do and I'm really, really good at it.  Arguing with myself about working for someone (a person and an organization) who/that values me and my experience, expertise, and education so little. 2. Had begun attending the  urlLink NILS  Online Data Entry Committee meetings.  Realized that there was a whole world of Cataloging out there of which I'd been unaware.  Realized that that wasn't an entirely bad thing (both the world and the previous lack of awareness).  Desperately wished I was younger, smarter and more hip so I could actually spend time with Jenica in a non-work fashion.  Began to model myself after Gail.... 3. Was driving the first new car I've ever had, a  urlLink 2002 Honda Civic LX .  Black and cute.  Not as nice as Tara's silver  urlLink EX , but cute anyway.  And new - until the psycho Xerox lady dinged it. 4. Was working in earnest on my thesis.  Planned to graduate in December. 5. Wore my hair below shoulder length, a bit less curly.  More of a strong wave.  And lighter brown to blonde.   August 2003  6 months ago, I: 1. Blah blah, SPL, blah blah.  I talk, write, and think about work too much. 2. Was trying to convince Tara that staying at  urlLink Dominican University  and finishing her MLS was a good idea.  She stuck it out, but wasn't overly happy about it.   3. Went to  urlLink Ikea  for the first time.  I  hate  Ikea.  Tara, Lori and I went  shortly after my birthday (27 Aug.), with the intention of buying out Ikea and Woodfield Mall.  Nothing worse than having the intention of spending a ton of money and buying a lot of stuff.  We took Tara's dad's SUV and could've fit everything into my old Horizon hatchback!  But it was a good day and I have many good memories.  ( urlLink Cheesecake Factory's  waiter and his charming personality, for instance.  And the Amazing Fortune Telling Fish.) 4. Turned 33 years old.  I think each person has a "maximum age", one that they never really imagined themselves above.  For me it was 27.  My " urlLink golden birthday " is the 27th, of course.  Female readers are probably nodding.  Male readers (are there any?) are probably scratching their privates and belching.  No, seriously, they're probably saying, "What's a golden birthday again, and why should I care?"  27 on the 27th.  Golden.  So I expected to get tons of gifts of gold jewelry when I turned 27.  And that it would be very meaningful.  And that my life would be perfect.  And I would be a grown-up.  Ha.  So turning 33 was just five years past that, which is like 5 years past dead.  Have I ever mentioned that I'm a little bit cynical? 5. Had urged Lori to go a little shorter and a lot lighter on my hair.  I was firmly blonde and now shoulder-length.  And the curl was pretty well gone.   February 2004  Yesterday, I was 33 and: 1. Nearly died in a fiery crash next to an unloaded semi on Cherry Valley Road on my way to an Online Cataloging Meeting at NILS HQ.   2. Was "misplaced" in the  urlLink Roscoe, Illinois  area briefly on my way home from said meeting.  Not lost - I knew where I was; I just didn't want to be there at that time. 3. Spent a great deal of time thinking about faith and belief.  Wondering if I am worthy of the good things that happen to me.  Questioning my place in the Big Picture.  Honestly, wanting more than I've got right now (in some ways).  Ruminated on the nature of cute guys at meetings and the flirting therewith.  Had George and Aretha running through my head most of the day. 4. Wiled away the afternoon at the processing desk.  Vista-foiling paperbacks.   Must   fill   position   before   go   insane   !  5. Wrote in my blog that James R. smelled like pee, and was amazed that neither Lora nor Jenica asked about it later. (6. Wore my hair in the current style.  Blondeish boblet.)   February 2004  Today, I: 1. Am 33.  Am cold.  Wore sweatpants and a long-sleeved t-shirt to work because I knew I'd be getting dirty.  Withdrew about 150 - maybe 200 - items from the collection, pulled cards, stamped, cut, boxed.  Processed.  Punched ICodes like a monkey.  Teased the new tech guy from LMA Techwork - John - about the juvenile DVDs being porn.  "Barbie in The Nutcracker."  "Adventures of Tom Thumb."  "Black Stallion."  "Harriet the Spy."  When you think about it, those titles could be.... 2. Went out for lunch with Tara.  Didn't want to go back to work, as always when I'm with her.  The urge to just call a halt to "real life" is strong.  Wanted to just  be  with her, bask in her grace.  This is going to sound pathetic, but it's like I'm warmer when I'm around her.  Edges are softened and sounds are more muted.  Having good friends makes everything better.  BLTs with no tomato and no mayo help, too.   3. Got an interesting twist on the processing clerk issue.  It's going to take some serious spin and lots of help from various supporting players, but if it works it'll save my ass and that of the library, and it'll be really good for the person who'll do the job, too.  Main problems: one big red ego and one bitter mermit-crab. 4. Had a migraine that prevented me from opening my eyes all the way, for most of the day.  I wonder what I look like to other people when that happens.  Do I look like I'm trying to be James Dean?  Do I look like I'm trying to be sneaky?  Do I look hung-over?  Lazy?  In pain?  Stupid?  If anyone would care to share, feel free.  One Excedrin Migraine, a bottle of Coke, and a half-hour nap (with cats) after work cured it.  For today. 5. Decided to change my hair-style.  Cannot look like those two.  I'm thinking that maybe some spiral curls are in order.   February 2004  Tomorrow, I: 1. Work from 8:30-5:00.  OK, maybe 9-5:30.  Or 9:15-5:45.  DOA (depending on arrival).  Collection Development meeting at 11:00.  That should be ugly and painful. 2. Need to do all the work stuff I haven't even addressed this week: a) 2 review journals b) catalog donations (3+ shelves full) c) weeding - pull a cart of 917-ish area books for perusal and possible withdrawal d) music CDs - none of ours are in OCLC records.  Why not?  Damned if I know.  But I have to move the records sometime. e) ICodes f) retolds.  Don't ask. g) process - a cart full of paperbacks.  So much Vista-foil! h) withdrawals i) Westerns - more OCLCizing Huh.  And that's just if nothing "comes up". 3. Have to eat the lunch I packed today but didn't eat because Tara took me to the Coffee Gourmet.  PB&J, carrots, apple. 4. Have to work on thesis revision at lunch, rather than reading for pleasure as I'd prefer. 5. Should work on the taxes.  Boo.  Man, this was depressing.  I feel old.  Am I that old?  Or just so tired?  Perhaps just that tired of what I'm doing.

       ...is to change my hair-style.  Both the Head of Adult Services (who is criminally unstylish) and now the Director of this library have haircuts similar to mine.  Time to grow it out?  Get a perm?  Dye it blue?

       Prequel: Planning: I don't usually drive to cataloging meetings in the winter because Trudy, who rides with me, prefers not to ride with me.  She has an SUV the size of a backhoe and doesn't like the view of the road from a Civic, and she's not too fond of my tendency to drive fast.  And loose.  So the plan was that she would pick me up at 8:10 for the 9:00 meeting.  Sunday (8 Feb.): St. John's Lutheran Church in Sycamore had a fire during the first service in the morning.  It was caused by some wiring (?) in the organ loft, apparently.  Trudy's husband is a firefighter and was in the congregation at the time that the fire was discovered.  He kept it under control with an extinguisher until the FD arrived and put it out.  It was serious enough to require FD equipment and caused cancellation of the second service.  Trudy told me about it on Monday morning.  Yesterday (9 Feb.):  I was at work until 5:30.  Around 5:00, I heard  lots  of FD sirens.  That's not too rare since the department is only about 8 blocks away from the library.  But there were lots of sirens and they were stopping too close for it to be a small thing.  I went out from Tech Services into the Circulation area and the staff and patrons were all grouped around the windows looking south - toward St. John's (which is on Main Street just off Ottawa St. - the library's at the corner of State and Main).  Black smoke was pouring past us on a strong northeasterly wind.  A rumor started quickly that the church was burning.  That was verified, unfortunately, when Trudy called me at home around 8:30.  She actually called to say that she couldn't drive to the meeting.  Imagine, the wife of a firefighter, taking the time to call a colleague at a time like that.  She just wanted to be closer to home.  But she had reason to be concerned, because two Sycamore firefighters had been injured, one severely enough to be taken to a Rockford hospital.  She sounded really shaken up on the phone.  I tried to make sure that she knew that the meeting was not important  at all , and that she shouldn't give it a second thought.  There was no reason that I couldn't drive.  She said she'd go to work, though.  I said that she should do it only if she wanted or needed to be there.  I know sometimes it's better to have something to do when you're upset, which she clearly was.  She and her husband were married in that church, and both of her children were baptized there.  And it was a total loss.  So I got up a little early this morning to get to the meeting on time.  I think I've written before that I'm rarely on time.  That's a lie.  I haven't been on time yet this year.  Seriously.   Never .  Yet.   At all .  The meeting was to start at 9:00, and Rockford's only 45 minutes away on a bad day when I take the back roads, so what kind of problem could there be if I left at 8:00, right?  I didn't get on the road until 8:10.  And it was snowing lightly and blowing  hard .  No, not "hard", but like a son of a bitch.  I was white-knuckled before I was on Old State Rd., which is saying something because that's maybe 3 miles from home.  Of course, I'd already passed one car well off the road in the ditch with a crumpled front-end by that point.  And I was thinking, "I'm doing this for what?  A cataloging meeting?!  Is that worth injury or death?"  But I trundled on, making decent time, braced against the wind, listening to my lovely Alpine CD player.  If you know me well, you know I like to make music mixes.  This morning I was listening to "Debbie Mix I", which I made for my Dearest Debbie, my partner in crime at work, my Collection Development teammate, the one who keeps me sane with a million telephone calls during the day at the perfect time to save me from the insanity that is our boss.  I was singing along to the music (which I had playing at a  pounding  volume) so I would "stay alert".  What a fallacy.  Anyway, the first song is "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by Deep Blue Something.  I first heard the song on a "best of the 90s" pre-recorded mix disc that I bought from Target, but I really liked it.    " I see you, the only one who knew me But now your eyes see through me I guess I was wrong So what now? It's plain to see we're over I hate when things are over When so much is left undone "  Moving on through Billy Idol, "Dancing With Myself", Hootie & the Blowfish "Hold My Hand", and then to the song that really made me think and brought tears to my eyes that could've caused a fatal accident if I weren't such a good driver (eh?)...  "I Knew You Were Waiting (for Me)" by George Michael with Aretha Franklin.  Granted, it's not the typical thing someone might be listening to.  And certainly not at that time of day.  And not in those circumstances.  But it was playing, and I was singing, and suddenly I was just nearly bawling.  Lip quivering, temples clenching, this is what did it:  " Somehow I made it through the heartache Yes I did, I escaped I found my way out of the darkness, Kept my faith (I know you did)  Kept my faith   - When the river was deep  I didn't falter  When the mountain was high  I still believed  When the valley was low It didn't stop me, no no I knew you were waiting I knew you were waiting for me  With an endless desire  I kept on  searching  Sure  in time our eyes would meet Like the bridge is on fire  -  The hurt is over , one touch and you set me free No,  I don't regret  a single moment No  I don't looking back  When I think of all those disappointments I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh...  ...  So we were drawn together through  destiny  I know this love we share was  meant to be  I knew you were waiting ... for me "   I know that this sounds totally crazy, but I was thinking about that church, and faith, and belief of all kinds.  What does "faith"  mean ?  Does it mean being patient and strong, and knowing in your heart that it's going to work out?  Or does faith mean getting off your ass and working until you're tired and sore and unsure, beating yourself up and making people crazy with your quest because  you have to help yourself ?  Is there no one true, right answer?  And if there isn't, how do you know which one is the right course?  Neither can seem like the right thing to do.  Being patient and sticking with it can seem much more wrong than actively changing something, doing something to change whatever one can.  But what if that's wrong?  What if it's better to just move, to just do it, even if action seems scary and the future seems uncertain?  Yargh.  This is what I was wrestling with when I should've been paying attention to the road.  I was following a plow and being tailgated by pickups and SUVs.  I was in the middle of nowhere (relatively), headed toward a meeting I didn't want to attend.    It stopped snowing around IL-72, not too far into my trip.  That's the good part.  The bad part = blowing & drifting.  There was snow  everywhere  on the road.  I passed a car completely overturned.  (Cops were there already.)  I was freaked out and just wanted to go home.  When I was on Cherry Valley Rd., which was pretty clear of snow, I was passing a semi.  Well, I started to, and then my car slipped out of 3rd gear when I was about 1/3 of the way past the truck.  My hands were cold and clammy and I must've not pushed the lever in far enough.  I panicked and only just managed to keep my head.  It was awful.  Jeez, this story is getting long.  I got to NILS at 9:02, got into the meeting around 9:10.  Walked in, saw that there were a few open chairs at the far end of the table (of course).  Planned to take the first one I saw, but there was a coat on it.  Took the next one, adjacent to James.  He smelled like pee.  I was also next to a woman I didn't recognize who was wearing HUGE eyeglasses.    That's when I saw  him .  The cutie.  He looked up from the prodigious amount of notes he was taking, smiled, and sort of blushed.  His head looked like he'd been through a buzz-saw - nasty haircut (dull scissors?) and a  really  bad shave (by a kindergartener?).  Bandaids!  On his face!  But an adorable smile and the most beautiful eyes.  And  blushes .  Maybe I spend too much time reading, but I think it's amazing and lovely when a man blushes.  He'd take some notes (he writes as fast as I do, which is impressive.  My old physical therapist called me "the human laser printer".) and then sort of glance my way, and when he saw that I was looking at him he'd color slightly and look away.   And then look back  - classic bar flirting material.  Damn.  Took me back to the Banger's Pub days.  Mmmmmmm.    Anyway, the damned meeting.  Fucking stupid.  Packing all those idiots in one room surely kills the brain cells of the rest of us.  Shall I identify them by name? James = Stinky Pee Man = Obstinate Ass Glen = Oblividude Gary Lee = Ponytail Man = unclefuckingcocksuckingassfucker = condescending son of a bitch Pat Adam....s = the most blatantly, purposefully, unrepentantly stupid person June = lookin' smarter every day Janyll = Grasping for Credit Gal = hopelessly lost in the serials module ("Have You Seen Me? If so, attach to a  serials record only .") Gail = angry little woman who I like more and more every time I see her or talk to her.  Goddamn, do I want to be Gail someday.  Having others as afraid of me as others are of her would be  fabu .  I can only wonder what they all think of me.  Dare I hope the little cutie is?  Dreamy.  I just hope it's not while he's shaving.  If today's any indication of his skills, he could be killed in the process.

       Someone just applied for the processing job.  On the application, she claimed familiarity with... the DUI DESSIBLE SYSTEM.  Yes, she has worked in a library for 2 years, as a "paige", but sought greater "responsobilitys" so she worked in tech services with the DUI DESSIBLE SYSTEM.   It hurts!

       I just told Trudy, my officemate, about something I haven't thought about in years.  When I was a freshman in college I took a class called Social Interaction.  It was a large lecture with about 200 students.  (OK, "large" by the standards of the institution.)  It was held from 10:30 AM until noon - and I remember the time for a specific reason that will become apparent.  I sat next to a  beautiful  boy with whom I'd graduated from high school, Todd Tweedy.  [He was later engaged to my oldest friend in the world, Jennifer Thorson.  She's now much more happily married to a great guy named Al, and they have an adorable son named Aidan.]  Todd and I sat around 5 rows back.    In front of Todd and me, by about 3 rows, were a group of around 6 heavy-set African American women.  Every day at 11:00, one of their watches would beep.  This was the late 1980s, when those crappy electric watches with plastic bands were still "cool", and she wore a classic model that looked like a diver's watch but couldn't have withstood a brief shower.  Anyway, the watch would beep and she'd shut it off, open her purse, and pull out 6 packs of birth control pills.  She'd pop out one pill from each pack, and pass them to each of her friends.  Like a momma duck, taking care of her ducklings.  Naturally, Todd and I, who were around 18 years old at the time, found this unbelievably hysterical.  I still think it's really funny.  I should be impressed that they were taking care of themselves and knew enough to entrust their reproductive health to someone who would be responsible.  But so many things could go wrong - she could be sick, or hit by a bus, or afflicted with a hangover or still shacked up with a football player or something, and they'd all be sunk.    Right in front of 200 people, handing out birth control pills.   Crazy.   Haven't thought about that in ages.

       My immediately family is nowhere near as complicated as  some  peoples' families - everyone goes by their proper names, for one thing - but things have been increasingly weird lately.  The last week has added a few wrinkles.  First, the bad news.  I only heard this yesterday, so don't think I'm all heartless and horrid for not mentioning it before.  I'll start from the beginning.  My brother, Gary, married Chris in 1985 (when I was 15).  They had a daughter in 1987, Stephanie.  They divorced sometime around 1991, I think; it was all rather hush-hush, but they'd been splitting up for the better part of 3 years by that time.  Chris was a really, really terrible person.  The first time I met her, I heard the story of how she'd been arrested in Chicago for biting a cop while under the influence.  Granted, it had been a couple of years since that had happened, but still - biting a cop!  My sister and I made a vow before the wedding that we'd never call her our "sister-in-law" since the term "sister" is one of respect.  We always called her "our brother's wife".  I was only 15, so I didn't fully realize how insulting that was to Gary, but Jane was 19 and must've known what it would mean to him.  Of course, he was only 20, so I'm not sure if he knew what he was getting himself into, either.    Anyway, they divorced and Stephanie lived with Chris until Chris began to exhibit signs of being too Chris-like.  Rather than getting too far into the details now, I'll just say that she voluntarily surrendered custody and moved far enough away that she saw Stephanie occasionally, but not too often.  And that was fine with the rest of our family, because Gary's a good dad and Chris is not a good mom.  Fast forward several years.  Chris called Stephanie on the phone and told her she was dying of cancer and wanted her Stephanie to come live with her for her last months.  Of course, Stephanie agreed.  She moved 7 hours (at least) north of where she'd been living with my brother, which is my hometown and where my parents - her grandparents - live, and all of her friends, and various other relatives.  And she took care of her half-brother Hunter by Chris' former boyfriend.  And then Chris got married, about a year or so ago, to a relatively decent guy who apparently didn't know her all that well.  Because after they'd been married for not too long, he (the guy) called my brother out of the blue and said, "Why did you and Chris get divorced?"  Gary didn't say anything.  The guy (I can't remember his name, damn it) said, "Was it because she drinks too much?"  Gary said, "Yeah, that was a big part of it."    So she was doing it again.  And she had, by that time, had another child, Fallon.  Did I mention that she didn't have cancer?  She lied about that, to get Stephanie to move in with them.    But somebody needed to take care of those little kids, Hunter and Fallon (where do these awful names come from?), and Stephanie had a boyfriend up there, so she stayed.  And she's getting straight-A's in school and we're all very proud of her and happy for her, even if we don't quite understand it all.  And even if we think she'd be "better off" living with my brother and his very long-term girlfriend, Angie, and Angie's daughter Bethany.  But we just coast through it because, really, what can we say?  Until last Wednesday when their phone rang at 4:00 in the morning, when Stephanie's stepdad was supposed to be at work but hadn't come in.  And when Stephanie answered it and went to get him, she found him unconscious.  She called 911 and helped the First Responder (they live in an area without professional ambulance service) give CPR, but it was unsuccessful.   He died .  She's 16 years old, and she was, for reasons that my brother still hasn't determined, the only adult home at the time.  When he had a heart attack, and was lying in bed in pain, and she was the only one there to call for help, stay with him, and try to save his life.  And now she's 16 years old, dealing with the idea that she couldn't save his life.  I can't even really get my brain around that.  What would that be like?  I don't want to know, of course.  When I was her age, I dealt with some stuff that was pretty bad.  My maternal grandmother died when I was 16 and I was the only child still living at home, so I was with my mom while she made arrangements and stuff.  But I was also home when she completely collapsed and suddenly I felt like I had to be Grown Up for the first time ever.  And it was horrible, but it was good for me, too, in a way, because I had a lot of growing up to do at the time.  And I was able to be there for my mom and to suck it up when the time came.  All of this makes me wonder if there's anybody in Stephanie's house right now who's sucking it up for her?  I know that Chris is a widow, and I have some element of sympathy for her, but I do wonder where she was when the tragedy occurred.  She has a history of being extremely unreliable and leaving her children alone at night.  Was she even there?  I'm sure I'll never know, and it's none of my business.  I'm just worried about what this is going to do to Stephanie.   As I wrote before, I found this out yesterday when I talked to my mom on the phone.  In typical my-mom fashion, she said, "I didn't think it would translate to email."  Yeah.    So, the other news.  The "good news":  my sister, Jane, of Christmas battle fame, is married.  She and Jim got married (we think) on a cruise boat (we think) near St. John, Virgin Islands (we think) sometime around 24 Jan.  We think.  Needless to say, nothing's been verified.    The happy (?) couple plans a Midwest tour this summer so they can meet each others' families.  I can't wait to see how that shakes out.  Remember, the last serious conversation that I had with her was when she told me to fuck off, so it's hard to imagine sincerely offering best wishes.  Particularly since my mom doesn't like him.  I'll try to keep an open mind.  Things could work out.  He could be a good guy.  Maybe Mom was just in a bad mood when they met.  And maybe pigs will actually fly.    Now, the mundane.  I'm tweaking the settings on the blog template almost daily, trying to get it to look a little less depressing, a little more sleek, and the sidebar more readable and useful and less busy.  I tried a visitor counter for about 15 minutes of one day and hated it - there was nothing in the fine-print about a pop-up ad every time one opened the blog!  Stupid pop-up ads.  Anyway, suggestions are strongly begged - tell me what works and what doesn't.   Chapter 2 is calling me.  Boo.

       Pooke hasn't figured out that she has legs - I've carried her around the house nonstop since I got home from work last night.  It's endearing, but I have work to do and we're both going to have to get used to it.    Someone asked me yesterday (more gently than this) "What's the deal with your thesis?  I can't tell from the obtuse comments you make about it on your blog."  I have to admit to being deliberately obtuse about it; this blog-writing is an opportunity to develop a world that is of my own design, and I want anyone who's reading it to know only what I choose for them to know.  i.e. Only the good stuff.  And my thesis, and all that surrounds it, are not good.  I'll give the barest details now, because I  must  get to work and get the damned thing done so I can go on with my life.  But this much should satisfy most curiosity.  Title: On the Threshold of Belligerency: Irish and Spanish Neutrality in the Second World War  Institution: Department of History [and Philosophy], Eastern Michigan University  Abstract: "Neutrality, as a political philosophy, faced a strong challenge during World War II.  Neutrality is an agreement among states that the independence and territory of a neutral will be maintained as long as it does not become involved in a conflict in such a way that might lead to war with another state.  Spain and Ireland were both neutral during the War.  Analyses of primary and secondary historical texts provides evidence that neither country conformed to neutrality as it was intended.  A case is made that, while looking out for her own best interests, Ireland provided crucial assistance to the Allies' naval campaigns.  Spain aided the Axis through her control of natural resources vital to the waging of war.  The impact of Irish and Spanish neutrality on the course of World War II is discussed along with the implications of how their actions affected the general understanding of neutrality."   I can't really express how little I care about this topic right now.  Neutrality used to be interesting to me - now it's a thorn in my side, an ache in my head that will never leave.  Well, maybe it'll leave in a week and a half.  We'll see.  But I can assert that my enthusiasm is long-passed.  On a totally different note, I was just making some tea.  And it cheapens me to admit how much I like my  urlLink T-Fal Vitesse electric kettle .  It boils a liter of water in 90 seconds, has an automatic shut-off when it boils, and the kettle itself is cordless (it fits into a corded base for heating).  My boss, who is otherwise incomprehensible and inconsiderate, gave it to me for Christmas.  It was an  excellent  gift.    I should sit down on the couch with my  urlLink Levenger Lap Desk  and start editing, drinking my freshly-made  urlLink Republic of Tea Emperor's White Tea .  But there's about 5" of snow in the driveway that will completely clear off if I shovel it, since it's just now crept above freezing, damn it.  So I'm going out to shovel.  Damn it.

       I got home from work after spending 8.25 hours with a lump in my throat, changed my clothes, and lay down on my back on the bed.  Hobbes (my gray cat) crawled up and curled into a ball in the crook of my knee.  Pooke (my black cat) stretched out from my thigh to my chest.  We lay there for about a half hour while I cried until my head was pounding, tears falling down the sides of my face into my ears.  Even as I felt them, I knew I was experiencing an odd mix of feelings: sadness for Jenica and for Jack, her younger kitty; guilt for coming home to my two healthy cats; loneliness for my friend to whom I've grown more close since she moved to New York; fear and dread for the time when I'll be in her shoes; more guilt for thinking selfishly of myself and not either gratefully about my cats or with more care about my friend; and both bone-tiredness and sleepiness from wanting to lay down and cry all day but not being able to do it.    What a shitty day.  And it wasn't even my day to be shitty.  Jenica's been much more copasetic about things than I would be.  Or, she's seemed that way.  She has lots of friends in NY, good co-workers who knew her kitties and who care about her happiness, and a boyfriend who, well, who's what I'd have chosen, I think, if I'd had the chance to hand-pick her boyfriend.  Her support system is extensive.  That's all anyone could want for a friend at a time like this.

       I've talked a lot, and written often, about how fortunate I've been in the last few years to have met some really wonderful, amazing people and gotten to know them well and come to be friends and count on them for things that I never knew a person could share with another person.  One of those people for me is Jenica Rogers.  This morning I read Jenica's blog, as I always do, when I got to work.  It's what I do after I turn the water on for tea.  Today I read, as did all of her friends, that her cat Chaplin died.    I met Jenica at the NILS (Northern Illinois Library System) Cataloging Committee meetings.  She was, at the time, the Technical Services Librarian at Rockford College, and the chair of the committee.  I'd been the head of my department for a while but we'd only recently joined the NILS consortium (long story) so I hadn't been expected to go to the meetings before.  Because she was so young when she earned her MLS and got her first "real job", I was intimidated and expected her to be really snippy about protocol and her expectations for my [professional] behavior.  It took no time at all for her to put me at ease, though, and to make me realize that her knowledge and experience lent her a grace that I honestly envied.  She's not power-hungry, but effective and intelligent.  And, over time, she became a real, valued, trusted friend.  And now she lives in New York, which is too far away from Illinois but where she wants to be.  Her job title is Collection Development Coordinator at SUNY-Potsdam.  We communicate often about reading, and I think she's the only person I know who actually reads more than I do.  I think that we are also both, elementally, "cat people".  She's lived with Chaplin for a long time.  She (Chaplin) seemed sick last night, and died at the vet's this morning.  It was obviously a very sudden thing, and horribly sad.  And I wish I could do something other than be sad.  I wish there was some way to convey to the people I work with that I don't want to talk today, or smile, or do anything other than think about my friends and the people I love (and the cats that I love, and the cats that I've loved and lost).  I wish there was some way to tell anyone who doesn't know her why this means so much, and why it's so sad, and why this is something that should make anyone stop for a minute and be aware of what there is to lose.  Is that pessimistic, or is it realistic?  I don't think I care what it's called.  Maybe it'll help me remember what's important and be less aware of what's not.

       I'm at work.  Until yesterday, I was pretty enthused about being here.  I was liking the job overall, enjoying the tasks, feeling like maybe I could keep my head above water and get everything done until I'd be able to hire someone for the processing position.  There are many, many things about my job that I like - cataloging is challenging and interesting, and collection development is almost like being able to buy all the books I want (or, $1200 worth of books a month, anyway) on a huge variety of subjects without having to pay the bills (literally, because I don't live in the library's taxing district).  Even the processing that I have taken on since Jinny left hasn't been sooooo bad, although there are things that I'd certainly prefer to do.  It's time-consuming and tedious, so it forces me to mentally check out for a few minutes and just chill.  Not a bad idea sometimes, when I'm pulled this thin.    But after yesterday, nothing's good anymore.  I'm still here, and I'm still doing it, but it's not good.  I met with the person who had to make the final decision about the job I'm posting.  The person who had the job before (and just retired) was, in a word, bored with the job, so some changes needed to be made.  We've made some changes generally that affect the position, so it's not all that surprising.  But I wanted to add some responsibilities and flesh some things out so they were less "assumed" and more "required".  I wanted to shift some things that have fallen on me (because I'm willing to take things on if no one else will help) to the new position, because it's more fair and really, some of the things I'm doing aren't worth the time for the head of the department.  (I spend  way  too much time mucking out the stalls.)  I went into the meeting with a clear idea of the boundaries of the job.  A specific picture of what I wanted.  A list of responsibilities and theoretical qualifications of prospective candidates.  A wage range - and the ideal - in my mind.  It didn't take 3 minutes for my happy bubble to burst and settle around me like a clammy shower curtain in a cheap afternoon hotel.  Her starting wage was so much lower than mine that I nearly choked.  It was barely more than half of what I'd expected to pay, and what I had reason to expect to pay, given the duties that will be asked.  The starting wage is considerably lower than that at which the retiree left!  And she was making so little that I'm surprised she stayed as long and relatively happily as she did.    The meeting lasted nearly an hour and a half, and I spent most of it cringing, grinding my teeth and clenching my jaw.  It was ended when she asked me if someone we both knew was planning to apply for the job, would apply for the job.  I answered, "Not at this rate."  She responded, "She needs to find a 'real' job, anyway."   What the fuck?!   Less than a week ago, I had a conversation with the Administrative Assistant of this library, in which I was told the exact amount of payroll carryover we'll have to the next fiscal year.  We have  more than enough  money to pay the rate at which I'd wanted to start this position, even allowing for usual raises for everyone on staff -  considerably  more than enough.  It's absolute bullshit for her to act out her powerplay bigheaded games on me, while I'm doing everything I can to make sure that this goddamned place runs the way it's supposed to.    No more.  Not one more goddamned fucking minute.  Today is the first fucking day of the new phase.  As of today,  I am Only Doing My Job .  By that, I mean both that I do no one else's job but mine, and I'm staying out of things that aren't my direct concern.  All that I get when I try anything else is, amazingly, stabbed in the back and slapped in the face at the same time.    No more.  And I'm surprisingly happy about it.

       A friend had a baby this morning.  A girl.  Although I knew she was pregnant and due in early April, it came as a surprise.  She has two sons from a previous marriage, but her husband hadn't had any children, so they were very happy when she found out she was going to have a baby.  And now there are five.  I was startled by the tears in my eyes as I read the email message: good news, for the first time in a while.  Tara's under the weather.  Debbie's had a cold for more than a week, although she seems to feel much better now than she has lately.  I wrenched my back last Thursday night, so I spent the majority of the weekend sitting in the one comfortable position that I could find (pushed up on my elbows a bit, on the Ikea chair) reading.  I raced through five books in four days.  Not sure I got very much out of four of them.  Mind in other places and on other things.  The weather has been more spring-like, more consistently.  Good thing and not-so-good, when it comes to running around outside in the rain.  But the flowers are happy about it, and the flowers (tulips and narcissus, I think) make everything look cleaner and alive again.  The grass in the yards on my route to work looks almost blue, it's so green - as if it's been spray-painted overnight.  The air even smells different.  Springy.  I haven't been back to the law library since that first day.  Good intentions, but I'm not sure what to do with them.  I don't know if the addition of six extra boxes is going to "blow the deal", or at least change things so significantly that something else will need to be done and so my efforts will be for naught anyway.  Besides, I have a million things to do  in  my office, so there's no desire to leave the building and cross the street to find more to do.  Terrible attitude, I know.  Especially since I'll be facing the judge (so to speak) about it sooner rather than later.  Yargh.  Why did I ever agree to do this?  I should've pawned it off on the Reference Staff!  It is, or should be, under their umbrella of duties anyway.  So while I've been deliberately not going over there, I've instead: weeded adult nonfiction (I made it all the way to 920 today!); sorted donations; compiled orders for the end of the fiscal year (including one yesterday for $102.32 in romance novels - sweet!); selected books from journals; processed (until the cows come home, leave, and come home again); repaired videos; withdrawn; filed cards; cleaned; sorted files and filed files; submitted an amendment of my LSTA grant budget; and oh, yeah, cataloged a little bit, too.  Not so much of that last one, though.    My boss returns tomorrow from two and a half weeks (?) in Hawaii.  I'm not looking forward to the results of her conversations with the staff.  She has a hard time understanding that for most of us, two and a half weeks in Hawaii is a once in a lifetime vacation opportunity.  For her, it's a once a year thing.  She just doesn't see that there's both jealousy and a sense of unreality to our perceptions.  It's not that each person begrudges her a vacation, but when people are making around $7/hr., it's hard to react positively to postcards about surf lessons in March.  I hope that she had a good time, and that for some reason she wants to keep her happy memories to herself.    I've "spent up" my second 15-minute break.  (That's how I'm using my hour lunch this week.  Thirty minutes for lunch and two 15-minute breaks to completely avoid work.  So far, so good.)  Time to process used juvenile video donations.

       Title:  urlLink Late Bloomer  Author:  urlLink Melissa Pritchard   Review: This is one of the strangest books I’ve ever read.  It’s ostensibly about Prudence True Parker, a divorced woman, a teacher at a community college in Arizona, living most of the time with her teenaged daughter, whose life pretty much goes on without her.  She doesn’t have much money, and she scrapes by – but she has a pool in the back yard and she occasionally splurges without realizing it.  She goes to the library one day and, in the unisex [restroom], aids another patron in need – gives them some toilet paper.  She learns that the recipient of her largesse is none other than Mildred Crawley, the author of the  Savage  romance novel series, appearing at the library for a speaking engagement.  Prudence attends.  Shortly thereafter, she is invited for tea at Mildred’s house…only to discover that she’s actually a man – Digby Deeds.  And he’s dying.  And he wants to “give” Prudence all of his plot outlines for the rest of the  Savage  series.  Now, she’s broke, but she’s also a writer (of one obscure, academic book that no one’s read).  She can’t debase herself by agreeing.    But then, maybe she’ll have to.  And, naturally, events require it.  So she comes to agree to write the novels.  And shortly thereafter, she has a psychic reading, in which she learns that she’s soon to find love in the form of a younger man with long dark hair whom she’d already met in the “etheric realm” – her soul mate.  She’d dreamed of a man who looked like this, laying down on her as if on a mattress.    Then, at a Native American charity event, she meets Ray Chasing Hawk.  And her life turns upside down.  This is a  crazy  book.  There’s no clear-cut protagonist.  Everybody’s weird; everybody’s lying; everybody’s got their serious problems.  But through it all, there’s a sense that Prudence and Ray are, for whatever unexplainable reason, somehow joined.  And it’s that sense that made it readable even when it was uncomfortable, even when I wanted to scream at the characters, and even when I was so frustrated with them and their lack of sense and strength that I wanted to put the book down.  Because when I did put it down, I’d just pick it up again later, all the more eager to know what happened.  That is, I think, the mark of a good book.  I actually  cared  how it ended.  Rate: 8.  I borrowed it from the library and I'm trying to convince myself that I don't need to go out and buy it now.  But as I sat down to write this review and paged through the book to get some specifics, I found myself re-reading and wanting to just start all over again at the beginning.  I don't know much about Native American culture, and it was really instructive in that realm.  And the writing aspect - I mean, writing as a profession - was done well, too.  It is quirky and fascinating and seems like it'll stick with me.

       When I was in college, I worked (in the AV department) with a bunch of guys - must've been 3 or 4 of them - who were all from Rice Lake, MN.  They used to have parties in their boathouse, which was this crappy house (more of a shack, really) on pontoons (barrels, actually) on a side channel of the Mississippi, close to the Wagon Bridge.  They rented it, just like an apartment.  It had electricity and heat and cable.  All the amenities except a shower, so they used the locker rooms at WSU every morning.  That must've been a real pain in the ass.  But it had an otherwise-functional restroom, so it wasn't so bad.  A tank of water for cooking and drinking.    Anyway, they'd have these parties.  Half-barrels of decent beer.  Hot snacks, which I thought was just so exotic.  Chicken wings and stuff.  The guys always outnumbered the girls probably 5-to-1, which was amazing at WSU because, well, anywhere in Southeaster Minnesota there are oodles more women than men.  So these parties were like smorgasbords for greedy college girls.  They apparently grow their boys on the large side around Rice Lake, too, because the boys (can't remember any of their names, although something's telling me that the ringleader was "Link".  How weird would that be for a guy's name from Minnesota, born around 1970?  Anyway...) and their friends from home were all big, strapping farmer types with bulging arms and wide thighs but tiny little waists.    We'd stand around and eat wings (and lick our fingers - aha! the reason for the wings!) and drink beer and flirt like mad, and try to not realize that  the whole place was subtly moving , gently swaying from side to side (stem to stern? port to starboard?).  It enhanced the buzz, lemme tell you.  And what made it truly classy and unforgettable?  Two things: 1. the  spiral staircase  leading to the Loft of Love (which I never visited, I swear to anything you'd like me to swear to), and 2. the  TV  renovated  as aquarium .  That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.  It even had a lava lamp on top.  I inspected it in detail (albeit drunken detail) once - ok, more than once - and could never tell how they got the tank inside.  But it certainly  looked  like a normal TV, except for the fantailed goldfish inside, swimming in 25+ gallon comfort.  Very cool.

       I feel really weird about babbling on while half my brain wanders back to the Rogers family, but I think that writing is distracting.  And maybe the absurdness of it will make someone laugh.  There's no  urlLink Friday Five  this week, so I'm going to do the one from October 26, 2001:   1. What's your favorite time of day?   11 PM.  It seems like that's when the day starts.  Does that make sense?   2. What's your least favorite time of day?   Any time of morning, really, but probably 8:AM.  It's the time that "everyone else" thinks is the legitimate start of the day, and it hurts me physically to be awake at that time, much less up and moving around.  Ergo...   3. Are you a morning person or a night owl? Does it cause any problems?   I am a night owl.  I do my best work at night (although you should take that in the most innocent sense possible).  If I had it my way, I'd wake up - without an alarm - around 11:AM at the earliest, eat a leisurely breakfast, check email and blogs, and get dressed (in going-out-of-the-house clothes) around noon.  I'd do errand-y stuff until maybe 5:00, and then start working.  Get my best work done around 11:PM.  Finish working at 1:AM.  Get to bed around 3:AM, give or take a few hours.  Total bliss!     4. If you had an entire worry- and obligation-free day, what would you do with it?   Huh.  I used to have these on Fridays.  Well, I'd get up around 11:AM....  No, seriously.  I'd sleep late, eat bacon in some context, read a lot - but only what remained interesting, nothing that was the least bit tiresome, blog some, probably go out for tea with Tara (or shopping; there's a bear hunt in our future, and Sephora's always good for a laugh).  Play pool.  Drive.      5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?   Tonight, dinner with my friend Beth from law school.  Afterward, pool or darts in my basement.  Talking about old times, certainly, and our mutual friends who are newly married or divorced or parents.  Or who have new or interesting jobs.  A bit of bitching about law school profs.  The usual. Saturday, reading and cleaning (boo!) during the day, and tea with Tara in the evening.  She's going to be in Rosemont at the International Quilt Show today and tomorrow with her mom, but she'll be back before Saturday's done.   Sunday, shopping in St. Getavia.  (That's the megalopolis of St. Charles-Geneva-Batavia.)  Trader Joe's, Cost Plus for scone mix, Pier 1 for a new plant table, wandering around looking for book ends for the wonderful but impractical bookcases from Crate & Barrel.  Maybe Victoria's Secret & Eddie Bauer - the usual suburban weekend haunts.  I need that spring jacket, damn it!

       OK, this is a little crazy.  I'm at work, and I just got done posting, but I realized that Lora's about to leave on vacation and I promised I'd let her see this.  It's not finished, but she can at least see the beginning.  I'll fill in the rest later tonight.    Why Real Life Isn’t a Romance Novel   1.  Because in real life, there are chapters after the epilogue.  And they’re not about when your sister finds  her  Comanche warrior – they’re about when you realize that people make a mess in the kitchen and don’t clean it up, or refuse to put away their shoes, or leave hair all over the bathroom, or snore.  Or can’t have kids.  Or find God when you find beer.  Or find beer when you find God.  And it’s hard to remember the rapturous sex from chapter 10 when you’re crying yourself to sleep – or wishing you were. 2.  Because for some of the times your eyes meet his across a room and there’s electricity, he is ten years younger than you, and you’re married, and he’s the electrician.  And you either can’t or won’t take the plunge.  Or you feel it and he doesn’t.  Or, God forbid, he feels it and you don’t, and you end up feeling both disgusted and oddly conceited while trying to explain to your friends that he asked you out, he’s not ugly, you’re not dating anyone, he’s not scary, but you’re not interested.  Because you’re not going to settle for someone who doesn’t make you feel  that  way. 3.  Because there must, theoretically, be some men, somewhere, who have average- to small-sized packages. 4.  Because sometimes it actually works out without all the conflict and horror - there's nothing to resolve, just peace with no need of eventual reconciliation.  Just happiness without all the crap to come before it.  Sometimes. 5.  Because real women crack ribs when they wear corsets, and that's not conducive to acrobatic and marathon sexual engagement. 6.  Because sometimes Prince Charming doesn't come along until the second time around, after Mr. Mistake reveals his true colors.  That often doesn't make for pleasant reading and is sometimes messy, but is often worth it. 7.  Because sometimes you love someone enough to realize that what's best for them is that you're not together.  And so you do your best, every day, to honor their wishes and be separate from them.  Even though it leaves an ache inside you that never really goes away.  Maybe it gets smaller, and sometimes it's very tiny - sometimes like a little gem that you can almost hold close and be proud of - but it's always there. 8.  Because in romance novels, very, very rarely are women and men  just friends .  And at this particular juncture, I have a few male friends - a couple in particular - upon whose shoulders rests a great deal, and for whom I'm very grateful.  That has nothing to do with their maleness, but everything to do with their friendship and trust.

       First, I'm thinking of Henry and Kristen and Jenica, and the rest of the extended Rogers family.  Second, I'm thinking of Lora and family, and horribly jealous of their vacation.    This leaves me the only one of the four of us (J, K, and L) still bloggin' away for the time being.  That's a lot of pressure to be heaped on my shoulders.  I'll do my best to carry the weight.  I'm nearing the end of the first week.  Other than the lunch issue, it's been pretty much the same old thing.  There have been some surprises - like discovering that our materials budget is completely toast, a month and a half before the end of the fiscal year! - and some truly irritating situations.  Like Monday, when I went to the courthouse to look over the law library for the first time.  The intention was just to see what's over there and make some very preliminary determinations of what we might be able to weed out.  We haven't nearly the space for them in the library that they have in the courthouse, so we simply must weed about 1/3 of the collection.  Theoretically, it's feasible.  Practically, it's impossible.  Particularly since they haven't had a law librarian since the dawn of time, and since their current space is a little cave in the basement that smells like mushrooms and sanding leather.  And since I'm being paid (by the library) to be a cataloger and head of technical services, not (by the court) to be a law librarian.  'Cause if I were the latter, I'd be making enough to compensate for sitting on the floor, like I was on Monday, getting all stinky from skudgy books, dusty from the rathole that they're in now, throwing out the 20th spare copy of 3 year old circuit court rules, and dehydrated because the 2500 volumes in that room the size of a MLB locker suck the moisture off your tongue like a cheerleader in heat.  I had help - Tara volunteered (OK, I practically dragged her there by her hair) - and would've collapsed from mental anguish without it.  There's  no  way this move'll happen by the end of May without some serious concentration of both labor and court resources.    Yeah, trial by fire indeed.  Today was LMA day at SPL.  I can't decide whether John: a. just thinks I'm a total, irredeemable freak b. thinks I'm a freak, but in a good way c. doesn't think at all, in part because he gets up  way  later every morning than he should and so is rushing around like a maniac and drinking Pepsi for breakfast. I wonder if he d. has read the blog and is embarrassed e. has read the blog and is pleased f. has read the blog and wants to throw spare monitors at me to make me stop writing in it about him? I did realize - much too late for it to make any difference - that I failed to make clear the other day that my intention of flirting with him is based not on the formula of (his proximity + his gender {which is rare in the library world}), but rather entirely on my thinking he's really quite interesting and enjoying both the conversations that we have and the way we glance at each other, on average, one time per minute over the four hours that he's here each week.  So it's that, plus the fact that he's got rather amazing cheekbones, and he's tall (have I ever been interested in a tall man?), that intrigues me.   So.  If he reads this, will he g. comment h. run screaming into the night i. start an opposition blog called "ihategerb.blogspot.com" j. flirt with me first k. ask that SPL be taken off his list of libraries l. ignore and avoid, and if necessary, "deny, deny, deny"?  Hmmm.

       Yesterday was the first day of The New Job.  Which is, of course, a misnomer, since it's the same damned job, just with another day in the week.  But it did seem like something different, if only because of The One Big Change - my lunch  hour .  Yes, I previously received 30 minutes for lunch, and now am required to take an hour.  Not "permitted", but  required .  That's because I'm in the dark ages of salaried employees wherein I still punch a time-clock, and if I neglect to take an hour off, I'm still debited an hour of pay.  So I'll be taking an hour off, of course.  Although it does indeed confuse me.  Why is it that on Thursday I worked 8 hours and took 30 minutes for lunch, and that was fine with everyone - the Director, the Board of Trustees, the Administrative Assistant, the rest of the staff, the state of Illinois, the federal government, and even the Big Man Upstairs - but yesterday I worked 7.5 hours and had to take an hour for lunch or risk the wrath of any number of those people and/or entities?  I even received a memo stating the policy in detail, setting out specifically that the hour lunch does not provide the salaried employee with the option of "coming in late" or "leaving early".    Silly me.  I thought that I'd been promoted to this position in part because I am a responsible person and can be trusted to work my average of 7.5 hours daily and 37.5 hours weekly.  Perhaps even without being monitored.  And that sometimes (for instance, when I have an appointment or desire lunch from a restaurant) I'd take an hour for lunch, but sometimes I'd come in at 9:00, take a half-hour lunch, and leave at 5:00.  And, fuck it, get all my work done in between.    Apparently not.  Now I have to, what, eat slowly?!  Waste my own time?  Or, perhaps, be so fucking bored during my lunch time that I just go back to work because I'm sick of smelling the rotting staff room, or feeling the lack of heating & cooling, or listening to the inevitable yammering of my coming-and-going colleagues?  I'm going to take this up with the boss when she returns from her vacation next Wednesday.  My big problem with it is that each of the other salaried employees has an individual office.  Each of them can take a lunch break in that office, closing the door and blocking out any attempt by coworkers (or employ ees , for that matter!) to demand that they work during that period.  They can use their email, blog, file their nails, nap, or do whatever they wish to do.  I, on the other hand, have no office door.  My desk is in the middle of a big room with 3 other desks and a table and at last count 8 unused computer monitors (plus component CPUs, printers, servers, etc.).  The place is  not  conducive to relaxation.  And my nearest coworker is  certainly  not conducive to my relaxation.  This is just another wrinkle in my personal situation that wasn't considered when I was "promoted" that needs to be ironed out before we go too far along this road.    So I'm dealing with it passive-aggressively, by playing music over-loud and blogging when I should be working.  It's making up in a tiny way for all the time I've spent reading journals at home in the last year, I think, so I don't feel overly guilty.  Besides, I've been wanting to mention this...  There are a couple of things that I really, really like that, when contemplated, make me think that my perspective is rather from the male point of view.  Case in point: I love driving too fast.  I particularly love driving a manual transmission too fast on curves, and most of all, I love the shift from 3rd into 4th on a left-hand curve - that sense that, if I don't keep my feet where they belong, I could go sailing into the ditch...Mmmmm!  Maybe it's a gentle but pervasive desire to lose control.  Other things that are like this: I like beer.   A Lot.   And a good steak.  And  urlLink Mythbusters , and  urlLink Star Trek: The Next Generation .  War books and playing pool.  I don't know; this sounded more...Earth-shattering in my head.  Must give it more thought and readdress later.   urlLink Robert  recently had a blog entry and thread of comments about music that makes him (and others) happy, even if it's not stereotypically "happy" music.  I didn't participate in the commentary because I wanted to give it more thought.   That I've done, and here's my non-exhaustive list.  (1) Laid by James ("You're driving me crazy, when are you coming home" defines my dating life in college and makes me laugh out loud, just like the first time I heard it.) (2) Send Me On My Way by Rusted Root (this song sticks in my head like a jingle, but I groove on it like a freak) (3) Oh L'Amour by Erasure (I know it dates me, but, the campier the better when it's Erasure.  Boppy, singable, heartbreaking.) (4) Drama!, also by Erasure ("The Lord only knows, the ultimate necessity of love" - mmm!) (5) Throw Your Arms Around Me by Hunters & Collectors, although the Pearl Jam version isn't so bad (not that I'm a Pearl Jam fan by any stretch of the imagination) (6) Nightswimming by REM (oh my God this reminds me of high school, even though I never went swimming at night.  We'd drive down to the river - the Mississippi River, that is - and hang out by the Wagon Bridge or Latsch Beach or Cotter Beach and drink beer or screwdrivers.  So much sand in my car.) (7) Breakfast at Tiffany's by Deep Blue Something (huh, I just realized how this list is very, er, 'now'.  That is, what I'm thinking about at this very minute.  Oh well.  As for this song, I think it's on every mix I've made in the last year.) (8) Smooth by Santana w/Rob Thomas (I've  dreamed  this song for the last three nights.  What's that all about?  But I wake up with a smile on my face.) (9) I'm Too Sexy by Right Said Fred ('cause it reminds me of someone who thought he wasn't sexy, and there's very little that's more sexy than that.  And the line about the kitty cat is just  funny ) (10) Be Good to Yourself by Journey (although almost anything on the Greatest Hits CD would do.  I can't hear Journey without singing.) (11) Out of Your Life by Bob Mould (a wonderfully angry song) (12) Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind (I still remember exactly where I was when I heard the song for the first time - a Target store, of all places - and it was the only time that I ever heard a song and immediately bought the CD that it was on.  A victim of marketing, certainly, but I loved and still love the song.) (13) I Knew You Were Waiting for Me by George Michael w/ Aretha Franklin (although "happy" is a relative term.  Happily contemplative, rather than happy-with-my-tongue-hanging-out-of-my-mouth-like-a-hound.) (14) Just Can't Get Enough by Depeche Mode (I cannot remain still when I hear this song) (15) Mission by Rush ("I wish I had that instinct/I wish I had that drive")  Subject to change.

       Title:  urlLink Virgin Territory: Stories From the Road to Womanhood  Author: Cathy Alter [compiler]  Review: This is one of those rare books (like  urlLink The Brothers K  and  urlLink The Silent Miaow ) that I would recommend to  anyone , albeit in this case to anyone of the female persuasion.  It’s not that I don’t think that men would “get it”, but there’s something that’s so inherently female about it that I think it should be “protected” for women and girls to enjoy and have as their own.  This from me, a non-feminist!  I laughed so hard while reading the first few sections, and the last few sections made me think and reminisce and wonder how it’ll be for me when….  I can’t imagine that it would be any different for anyone else.  I want to buy a dozen copies of this book and send them to all of my good friends.  What better way to say, “I know who you are, because in a sense, I’ve been there.”  Rate: 8 - some of the selections are weaker than others, but overall this is a wonderful, unforgettable book.   Highly  recommended.

       Title:  urlLink Little Children  Author: Tom Perrotta  Review: Ah, shit.  This was disturbing and fantastic, sad and funny, everything I wanted it to be and still strangely disappointing.  Perhaps that’s part & parcel with the storyline.  Stay-at-home mom Sarah is unhappy in her marriage to Richard.  Richard is in his second marriage, and only recently realized that he didn’t really do it right either time.  Todd is “The Prom King”, a stay-at-home dad who watches the skaters at the library and plays tackle touch football while he pretending to study for the bar exam – for the third time.  His wife Kathy produces documentaries on WWII veterans and gripes at him, increasingly loudly, about his lack of ambition.  Ronnie is a convicted child sex offender whose presence in town has heightened tensions, particularly for Larry, whose marriage just exploded.  When Todd and Sarah drift, quite unintentionally yet very happily, into an affair, it changes things for everyone.  I love the way that he writes.  More than many contemporary authors, what he chooses to leave out is as important as what he chooses to address.  Sarah, for instance, experienced a brief ‘flirtation’ with bisexuality, but she’s still able to be a stunning combination of innocence and raw need.  Todd should be a cartoon, but because he’s revealed only tiny bit by tiny bit, he remains fresh and clean and appealing.  Even Ronnie, the bleak and unforgivable character, is perhaps more sympathetic than Larry, his nemesis.  There’s so much nuance and depth that I can’t wait to forget exactly what happened – so I can read it again.  Rate: On my 10-point scale, it rates an 8.  Totally subjective, not really explainable.  I really liked it but didn't  love  it.  Maybe it's because I so adored  urlLink Joe College  that I didn't give this a higher rating.

       Warm (44°) and sunny and no wind.  A great improvement on yesterday's snowing in ball form as I was driving to work.  I had to go to the Clinic at 8:20 to have lab work - a blood draw - and it didn't go badly, all things considered.  Not a long wait.  When I told the phlebotomist that I was cold and that it's often difficult to get blood from my arm so taking it from my hand is an option, she said, "OK, I'll check your arm first but if I'll move to your hand if there's nothing in your arm."  Unlike those who take it as a personal challenge to find a vein where there don't seem to be any.  I'm 33 years old.  I've had blood drawn hundreds of times.  You'd think they'd realize that I'm not kidding when I say that there aren't usually veins in my arms big enough to get blood from.  But they put on the tourniquet and poke (with their fingers) and then inevitably say, "I think I've got one."  And then poke with the needle and say that word that someone with a sharp thing should never say:  "Oops."   But she tried my right elbow (rare) and my left elbow (1 time in 1000), then tried my left forearm - never before! - and got one.  Used a butterfly, told me it would hurt more than usual, used one good jab, and got it.  And it didn't really hurt all that much after all.  And (I just checked) it didn't bruise - at all!  There's one tiny needle hole but no bruise.  Should've kissed her when I had the chance.  When I left the Clinic, I'd only been inside for about 10 minutes.  There was an inch and a half of snow on the car.  I had to brush it off.  While I did that, I got covered with it.  Yes, I have a hood, but I didn't even think to wear it until I was covered with snow.  IT'S MARCH, damn it.  I hadn't even considered it.  So I drove to work in the sludgy crap behind 2 plows that were side by side so no one could pass them (it wasn't deep enough to plow, people!  And they were going 20 mph in a 40 mph zone!)  By the time I got to work, I was steaming.  Literally.  And when I looked at myself in the mirror next to the clock, I saw what the damned snow had done to me - it had turned my hair into a freak-show.  The left side of my head was a perfect flip.  The right side was a perfect bob.  It was my 8th grade class picture come to life.  Argh.  So my intended plan for the day, which was to do some work (duh), and eventually to go to the courthouse (across the street from the library) to start weeding the county law library in anticipation for its relocation to the library building (yes, I'm being exploited for my J.D. - more on this topic as time and interest warrants), but in the meantime, I was planning to begin doing something that I'd been thinking about more and more in the intervening week - flirting with John.  For those of you who've never worked in a public library, or those of you who are not female and who have worked in a public library, you cannot know the sense of utter... testosterone withdrawal  that one goes through in a situation like that.  It's positively withering.  The only people of the male persuasion that one is likely to see during the course of the typical day are 1. small children (boo!), 2. the homeless (not bad in themselves, but certainly not an example of those with whom the average, much less the professional, library worker should show any extra-professional interest - and they're often smelly), 3. the elderly (basically ditto to the explanation for #2 except that they're sometimes smelly but in a different direction), and 4. the temporary worker.  #4 includes delivery workers (e.g. UPS), maintenance and repair guys, and occasional personnel - like computer consultants.  Our UPS guy has  zero  personality and cringes when we say "Hello," so there's no point in trying to develop rapport with him.  As for repair or maintenance guys, no one will ever measure up to...never mind.  That's a story best left untold.  But the main point is that they show up so rarely that it's just about impossible to create anything.  But the last example is quite different.  He's there weekly, he's in my office, and he seems to think - at least, I seem to believe that he thinks - that I'm...'not the same as everybody else'.  Because when there's no one else in the room, he'll often ask me questions (like the "is 20 too young to get married?" gem that set off the flurry of comments last week) and look at me rather strangely.  No, I can't lay that all on him; I'm sure that I'm the one who starts the strange looks.  But there's almost always someone else in the room, damn it, and that's impeding my sense of progress.  I'm not proposing anything untoward, people, just some gentle flirting to make the day go more quickly and much, much more pleasantly.  And that's not happening with a babysitter (or an Amysitter?!) in the room.    I wonder if he knows that I'm thinking that?  Would he be charmed, or something less?  Friends from college coming down to visit this weekend.  Dan is a math teacher and football coach at Dover-Eyota High School.  Mary is a paralegal for Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services in Rochester.  I'm very pleased and humbled that we're still friends.  They definitely saw me at my worst, or close to it.  "They knew me when...," and like me anyway.  It'll be a good weekend and hard to say goodbye.  Pooke's having a hard time right now.  The sun has shifted enough that it's not coming in strongly through the east windows anymore, but it's not yet pounding in through the picture window (southern exposure) in the living room (where I am).  She's wandering back and forth, occasionally looking up at me and saying, "Mrowr?"  Like, "Turn the heat on, damn it!"  She's almost all black and likes to soak up the sun.  Hobbes, who's gray, doesn't like the sun as much.  I think her skin is a lighter tone and she feels too hot too fast.  Like, say, me.  I never did get the hang of laying out in the sun.  I tried many times - I'd spread out a blanket in the back yard (we lived in the country so it was no big deal) and I'd read for a while with my book in the shadow of my giant melon head (it seemed like that, anyway).  I'd get sleepy so I'd put the book down and snuggle up to Murfie, the homecat.  The next thing I knew it would be 2 hours later and I'd have been asleep in the sun the whole time - only I'd have pulled the blanket  on top  of myself!  Some suntan - I was just undone by heatstroke!  Pathetic, truly.  Now, to answer  The Friday Five , courtesy of  urlLink Jenica  (where are you getting these, JPR?):   If you...  1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  Tea.  Dessert - cookies, brownies, scones.  Homemade, and the kind of stuff that when they eat it people say, " How  did you  do  this?!"   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  Definitely books.  Perhaps paper & pens - the kind that I want, but have to go to Geneva or Oak Brook to get.  Decent writing paper, and pens that don't have removable caps.   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  Fiction, for sure.  Probably an elegy.   4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  This is too funny.  I would make the world's worst teacher because I have no patience, and I do not care a whit for the general public's ability to do or know anything.  That being said, and in the spirit of doing questionnaire-like things (which I adore), I'll say... Constitutional Law.  Or First Amendment Law.  Definitely to law students, though, as part of a regular law school curriculum, and not college or (god forbid) anything younger than that.   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  I saw  urlLink Sabrina  (with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond) for the first time last night, so my first response is Hobo Music!  But seriously, I personally have very little musical talent - I have musical "skill" in the sense of being able to put things together that sound good.  I think.  So I'd make a compilation album, I guess.  A mix, if you will.  I'm sure it would include some 80s stuff.  Maybe I'd call it, "The 80s didn't suck as much as certain people think they did - See?!"  And I'd be right.  Time to vacuum and otherwise prepare for Dan & Mary's arrival.  Bon weekend, everyone!

       ...is only a month away.  Heading to Miami for 5 days mid-April.  Staying at the  urlLink Hyatt Regency Miami .  I'd like to do all sorts of sports-related stuff (baseball for sure, perhaps some golf), but Tara's decidedly  not  interested in that.  We'll definitely go to the beach and shop a lot.  I'm a sucker for tourist t-shirts, although my taste is improving slightly and I no longer come back with a dozen of them.  (Washington, D.C. t-shirt hawkers made their quota on me a couple of years ago, definitely.)  I'm mostly looking forward to being out of the Midwest.  I'm sick of snow, sick of wind, sick of winter.  Sick of dry skin and cold feet.  Sick of white sky and gray-brown grass.  I've never been the sort of person who lives for their vacations, but I'm tempted in this case to prematurely obsess.    April 14 cannot come soon enough!

       Thinking and blogging about feminism, and reading  urlLink Virgin Territory  (which may be one of the funniest and most heartfelt books I've ever read), made me think about some other books and things I've read that had an impact on my in regards to gender and its implications on my life.  So I dug through my list of quotations and "things to think about someday when I have time" and came up with the following.  It's not in any particular order, and some of it is definitely more meaningful than the other.  But for what it's worth, each of these struck a chord with me at some point in my life, about women or men or what they mean to each other.  Enjoy.  Jill A. Davis, in  urlLink Girls’ Poker Night : “That’s how it is with him.  And I liked that he was nervous.  That I was someone to be nervous about.  At the same time, I knew something awful about myself – I knew that I needed him and that I would be absolutely crushed when this all ended and he went away.”  Prue Leith, in  urlLink Leaving Patrick :  “See the mothers in the park, Ugly creatures chiefly, Someone must have loved them once, In the dark, and briefly.”  Suzanne Finnamore, in  urlLink Otherwise Engaged : “I feel very close to him, as though he were my right leg, or an eye.”  Suzanne Finnamore, in  Otherwise Engaged:  “I don’t want to miss him so much.  I want to be able to turn it down.  Instead I live with a rock in my heart.  I walk through Paris, carrying it.  Maybe this is what they mean by the ball and chain.”  John Burnham Schwartz, in  urlLink Claire Marvel : “Suppose someone were to say to you: These are the happiest days of your life, right now, and they are already ending.  What would you do?  You might craft yourself a credo, a phrase to live by; might write the words REMEMBER THIS on an index card and tack it to the wall above your desk.  You might practice meditation, seeking through the emptying of your mind that state of mindfulness in which your life with its many attendant contradictions might one day be appreciated as it is, without questions of ownership or control.  You might fail miserably at this.  You might turn your back on your desk and the invocation (or imprecation) on the card, on the whole static cowardly life of the desk, only to find that no other life occurs to you, that you are not fit for any other existence; and so, losing your nerve for the hundredth time, you might retreat.  The card would still be there on the wall, waiting for you.  And you might once again sit gazing into the wake of all your feeling, a prisoner of memory, until before too long you realize that every one of your love poems to her has become an elegy, and every elegy, a love poem.”  Sally Mandel, in  urlLink Out of the Blue : “The hurt from missing him became as familiar as the feeling of air against my skin.  It was always there.”  Edna St. Vincent Millay:  "... if his voice be anything,  Why, shut your lids and hear him sing, And when he wants you, take him back"  Kate Manning, in  urlLink Whitegirl : “[I] was headlong.  I was.  Heedless.  He liked that about me.  I unhinged him, he said I did.  I couldn’t say no, never knew my head from my heart.  I wished and thought wishes were truth.“  Elaine McCreight: “It’s true that we don’t know what we’ve got until we lose it, as the old saying goes.  But it’s also true that we often don’t know what we have been missing until it arrives.”  Jens Christian Grøndahl, in  urlLink Silence in October : “In a subtle way my intellectual loneliness was the price I paid not to be lonely.”  Jens Christian Grøndahl, in  Silence in October:  “Eventually I stopped asking myself if I was happy.  It had become unnecessary, but also futile to ask.  After all, you can’t be happy all the time, gasping and salivating in one trembling spasm of happiness from the time you get up until you finally fall asleep with an idiotic smile on your wet lips.”  André Berthiaume:  "We all wear masks, and the time comes when we cannot remove them without removing some of our own skin."  Henry Drummond:  “You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have really lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love.”  Michael Griffith, in  urlLink Spikes : “It can be hard to tell the difference between what you feel and what you feel you ought to feel....”  Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in  urlLink Biographia Literaria : “What if you slept, and what if in your sleep you dreamed, and what if in your dreams you went to heaven and there you plucked a strange and beautiful flower, and what if when you awoke you had the flower in your hand?  Ah, what then?”  Dave Barry, in  urlLink Dave Barry’s Complete Guide to Guys :  “People wonder, sometimes, how come white people don’t play basketball as well as black people.  The answer, I believe, is that for some reason Nature decided to concentrate all of the natural basketball ability for the entire white race for the past fifty years into Larry Bird.”  Harvey Fierstein:  "Never be bullied into silence.  Never allow yourself to be made a victim.  Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself."  Pam Houston, in  urlLink Cowboys Are My Weakness : “This is what you learned in college: A man desires the satisfaction of his desire; a woman desires the condition of desiring.”  Ethan Canin, in  urlLink Carry Me Across the Water : “Without [her], he realized at that moment, he was a stranger to his own life.”  Christina Bartolomeo, in  urlLink Cupid & Diana :  “Childbirth is perhaps a holy experience, but like most holy experiences, I prefer that it happen to someone else.”  Christina Bartolomeo, in  Cupid & Diana:   “There’s something you learn once you’re over thirty.  You learn that surviving is a matter of putting time between you and what hurt you, that time makes you stronger and tougher in spite of yourself.  When you’re younger, people tell you this but you don’t want to believe them.  When you’re older, you take consolation in the fact.”  Christina Bartolomeo, in  Cupid & Diana:   “You can’t choose where you belong any more than you can choose your talents or the color of your eyes.  I loved Harry in the same way that I was flat-chested, the same way I hated nutmeg, the same way I’d inherited my mother’s downsloping eyelids.  My lucid, consoling brain knew that I would someday find another man I would love very much, maybe more than I’d loved Harry.  But the thought of that man made me feel desperately lonely for Harry.  I wanted him, not some new love, not even a better love.”  Anne Lamott, in  urlLink All New People :  "In a way I've never quite understood, the veil tore an inch for me that day, like it does every so often, when in the midst of all that is mundane and day-to-day, there's suddenly a tiny tear in the veil, and you see the bigger brighter thing, and then the veil repairs itself, and the day goes on as before."   Anne Lamott, in  urlLink Hard Laughter : “And these are the thoughts I was left with: that romance is stupid and sometimes worth it; that friendship is risky and always worth it; that I am ridiculous, and that I am not.”  Susan Minot, in  urlLink Rapture : “She did the right thing and still she felt pain.”  Josie Lloyd & Emlyn Rees, in  urlLink The Boy Next Door : “I can’t bear that [F] might be near.  It makes me feel crowded in and trapped.  He’s here, behind every car window, in every shop, living in my telephone receiver.  Without knowing it, seeing [F] in my world has attached mine to his.  I feel as if he’s hooked tendrils around everything that’s precious to me, and lifted me out of the safe world I’ve built and left me dangling, looking down at a deep, dark void.”   Jonathan Hull, in  urlLink Losing Julia :  “How could I have such different, incompatible sides to myself?  Maybe other people are like mirrors that we see ourselves in; versions of ourselves that vary dramatically depending on the particular cut of glass.  Do we marry promising images of ourselves, only to watch those images become hopelessly distorted?  And what do I see now?”  Thomas Mallon, in  urlLink In Fact , quoting Sinclair Lewis (in  urlLink Main Street ): “‘She tried to be content, which was a contradiction in terms.’”  Ann Wadsworth, in  urlLink Light, Coming Back : “‘Love is okay, but brings its own troubles.  Me, I’m glad to be in the pasture now, not lookin’ for adventure.’”  Nathaniel Hawthorne: “No man, for any considerable time, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude without finally getting bewildered as to which may be true.”  Marion Roach: “She was losing her mind in handfuls.”  Thomas Mallon, in  In Fact,  quoting Howard Norman (in  urlLink The Northern Lights ): “‘people should not become their losses.’”  Alexander Chee, in  urlLink Edinburgh : “How could he love me?  There’s nothing to me except a place where the light resists moving forward.”  Alexander Chee, in  Edinburgh:  “I have to go, he says.  And is gone.  I sit for a while, as the heat of him disperses into the air, the stone, me.  He thinks he can leave me by leaving me.”  Alexandra Thorne, in  urlLink Intimate Strangers :  	“‘You’ve already given me more than you could possibly know.’ 	“‘And what’s that?’ 	“‘You gave me myself.’ 	“A sad little smile tugged at the corners of his mouth.  ‘My mistake.  I should have given you me.’”  Justin Cronin, in  urlLink Mary and O’Neil : “‘Why do I love the things that no one cares about?’”   Sue Haasler, in  urlLink Time After Time : “You don’t really care about your personal safety when your dreams have just been shattered.”  Michael Redhill, in  urlLink Martin Sloane : “How can you help someone name an absence?”  Jeanne Ray, in  urlLink Julie and Romeo : “I was lighter in that moment.  I was my best self, loving and gentle and kind.  It was so good to see that woman again, so good to hold another person in this way and be held.  If a giant asteroid fell on us at that moment…mine would be counted as a happy life, a good life.”  Plotinus, quoted in Paul Russell,  urlLink War Against the Animals : “We are what we look upon, and what we desire.”  Mary Balogh, in  urlLink Slightly Wicked : “This was the night that would give light and warmth and meaning to all the rest of her days.”  Judith Kitchen, in  urlLink The House on Eccles Road : “…nothing had seemed very good for the past eight years and that wasn’t really fair, was it, because there were good things but they paled beside his dreams deferred.”

       A few times recently - 3 times in the last 2 days?! - I've written something in a blog or by email that's either been taken with the wrong intent or has turned into something much bigger than how it started.  I know this process isn't unique to me, but it's still making me uncomfortable.  I'm going to try (as always) to fix it by explaining, even as I can hear the echo of my conscience whispering, "Let it go."  That's not in my make-up.  This whole mess (or at least what I think of as being a mess) started with my job.  Until January, I was the part-time (28-32 hours/week) Head of Technical Services, supervising two staff members who worked 20 and 30 hours weekly.  One left in January for what I can only assume are personal reasons.  I found out that she was leaving by email while I was on vacation, through a confusing web of communications with several people.  The last week that she was going to work (after I'd returned), she didn't come in four of the five days that she'd been scheduled due to bad weather and/or illness, and on the one day that she did work, she left several hours early.  The result of all that was that I began the year feeling like I couldn't catch up and had very little idea what she actually did.  She had made it clear, though, before she left, that she never had 30 actual hours of work to do, so the new hire shouldn't be expected to work that much.  Since we'd never adjusted her position after the library automated, that was a reasonable assessment.  So I decided, with the support of the library director, to wait for a couple of weeks before posting the position, to determine more closely what our actual needs were for that area.  I split the work with the other staff member, and received additional help from some members of the circulation department as they could afford to give it.  After a few weeks and lots of consideration, I met with the director and determined a pay-rate and number of hours, based on the expectations that could be met by a theoretical candidate for the job.  Frankly, there are a number of ways that the job could be filled, and if someone were hired who could do the minimum but very well, they would be paid accordingly and no more.  That's not unreasonable.  But if we found the perfect combination of experience, creativity and motivation, then the pay-rate and number of hours would increase quite a bit.    The job was suggested to someone who I'd had in mind all along, but that person was not interested at that time.  We posted the job internally.  Two people applied, were interviewed, and were not right for the position.  After a great deal of consideration, I chose to take on the additional duties myself rather than posting the job externally.  I'll begin working full-time on March 22.  Until then I'm scrambling to do the primary job I was hired to do (cataloging), plus the job I've since taken on that is really my first love (selection and acquisitions), plus all the myriad extra duties that have been piled on in the intervening years.  Plus  all  of the processing, since the other cataloger has basically decided that if she doesn't get a raise, she's not going to do it.  I'll not get into that now; our relationship is a constant challenge that will never be resolved.    However, the person that I originally wanted in Processing - who would be perfect for it and for all of the other collateral responsibilities that were optional - is free now to take a position if one becomes available.  So I just wish that I could go back in time and give the job to her, and keep my own regular 28-32 (well, it's closer to 32, really), and not have to change my life so much.    But there's no going back, right?  So I'm periodically freaking out, trying desperately to get through my piles of paperwork, boxes of books, mountains of donations, inboxes teeming with email screaming for replies, and always in the back of my mind, the thought,  "This Is The Rest Of Your Life."   I didn't sign on for this, you know?  I wasn't going to do this or be this.  I always said that if I wanted to die of a heart attack by age 35, I'd have been an attorney - at least the money would be better.  And who do I have to blame for being here and doing this?  No one but me.  So boo fucking hoo, really.  I knew it would happen.  That's why, when  urlLink Jenica  pensively asked this week - probably rhetorically - "How many hours per week is too many hours per week to be working? And what is 'enough'? How about 'satisfied', 'accomplished', 'done', or 'productive'?", I opened her Comments box immediately and chimed in.  Well, I was limited to 1000 characters and on my first try I think I probably exceeded that by 3 times.  Who better to give advice than someone who's desperately in need of it?  So I spouted off exactly what  I  need to hear, or  not,  and when I read her blog the next day, I was stunned - literally - to see how negatively my comments had been taken.  "All I'd said was..." that she should work a little extra now so that she feels more caught up, and then she should go back to her normal routine.  'Cause that's pretty much what I'm going to have to do, soon.  But judging by the comments that other people left, I'm not only a fool, I'm also proposing that she ruin her life in pursuit of an unattainable goal: work satisfaction.  So I (much as I'm doing now) hopped back into the fray to say, "Well, I was just looking at it from my own point of view, which happens to also be, very basically, the same sort of atmosphere in which she (Jenica) works."  Not sure that went over any better.  It probably came off sounding all holier than thou (which it does now) because "none of you can understand - you're not living La Vida Librarian!"  Ah, I'm such an idiot.  Naturally, I was led to think about why I'd given in to those urges to use someone else's blog as my forum for (attempted) disputing my internal demons.  And it came to me that it has something to do with my concept of "self" and "personhood" and feeling and being "different".  And, naturally, when I'm in for a penny, I'm in for a pound, what better way to get that out than to blog it?  Last night, I tried to explain it, and did so badly, through my understanding of my own -ism or lack of same.  Yeah, that's what I meant -  my own  lack of feminism.  The part of me that feels weird or deficient when I'm in conversation with other strong women because they go about things so differently than the way that I do, or they seem to understand things so much differently than I do.  It's like I'm missing some key element that makes it all makes sense.  I'd so much rather play pool than make a scrapbook, you know?  But that doesn't meant that I'm claiming any particular lack of femin inity  - 'cause I'd love to have nice fingernails and there are few pleasures on earth like having one's hair washed (I mean, really, if most men knew what it's really like to have a shampoo and condition in a nice salon, it would be against the law).  My lingerie drawer is so full that it's actually two drawers, and I used to buy lots of "product" (a la Kyan) until Lori taught me the error of my ways (I can spend more on what I want, rather than getting tons of different things and not using half of them).  But I don't know Harriet Tubman from Clara Barton, and I don't know suffrage from a hole in the ground.  Perhaps I "should" - fuck, I  know  I "should" - but if I can't be troubled to remember how many miles it is from the library to NILS for travel expense reports (I always have to look it up), there's no room in my head for stuff I "should" know.    And it seemed, and seems, important to explain this to the people who might be reading the things that I write and wondering where my head is when I'm writing.  Particularly because I seem to have an all-female audience, at least as far as those who undertake to comment are concerned.  (I know that you're reading, Californian, even if you don't say anything.)  Anyway, if I'm writing like a jackass, I wanted you to know that it's because this is  me , this is how I think, and it's  not  because I think this is how anyone else should think.  Ugh; I'm starting to get philosophically muddy and should probably just stop before I make it any worse.  I'll just say one more thing.  My intention wasn't to set the cause of feminism (or any other -ism) back 20 years.  It was only to clarify my own perspective of firmly-held confusion.  Ach.  This is all too serious.  Next post will be my typical oddity - I promise.

       That's of interest to people who read generally, not necessarily to people who are reading this.  I've no clue what's of interest to y'all.  Really.  I subscribed to an email mailing list a while ago, something about books.  It arrives weekly and gives little reviews of new books and short interviews with authors and things.  They've started a new service -  urlLink a list of books (mostly fiction) that will be published in the next few months .  It seemed pretty comprehensive (given that I see the fiction reviews).  So, I'm not a feminist.  The  urlLink Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary  defines  feminism  as "1: the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes; 2: organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests."  By the second definition, I'm clearly excluded.  I've never joined or associated specifically for the cause of women's rights or interests.  Under the first, I could be forced to conform, but I would think that it would be more of a preference issue than an against-one's-will situation.  Simply put, I think a great deal about the circumstances of individual women, and I often consider the topic of human rights.  But I rarely, if ever, devote thought or action to the consideration of fairness or even equality for those of my gender.  Maybe it has its roots in having had, from early on, traditionally male interests - like history, law, and sports (ok, I don't participate all that much, but I certainly  know  a lot about some of them.  I can talk golf until the cows come home, and baseball - Mmmmmm, baseball!).  I've always had more to talk about with women than men.  This isn't coming out right; I'm coming off sounding like one of those flaky girls who explain away their promiscuity by saying that other women are just competition and that only men understand them (and that they  really understand  men).  But it's always been that way, that I can talk to guys (boys, men, whatever) without feeling like a ... whatever, like there's something lacking.  And peoples' dads have always liked me, with the possible exception of Andy Kudrle's dad.  But that's another story (and it wasn't my fault!  Listen closely to the lyrics of "Wake Up, Little Susie" and you'll understand.).    Here's what I'm decidedly  not  saying: that women don't deserve what they have, or shouldn't have the opportunity to get it or to try for anything.  What I do want to say is that I don't think that women getting more than they've worked for,  just because they're women , is right,  at all .  What does that say about our ability to do what we want for ourselves?  What does that say about equality?    It makes the idea of all-girls' public schools such a conundrum.  My public school experience was positive.  I learned a lot, had mostly good teachers, and didn't have any negative experiences as far as bullying and all that.  Well, there was a bit of economic intimidation - two girls tried to hassle me for a while because I didn't have really fashionable clothes, but I didn't fight back (I was totally chicken shit, but it must've come off sort of Zen-like) and they eventually lost interest.  I made some good friends and learned some terrifically important life lessons.  Like, don't blow on a fire, 'cause it won't make it go out.  And don't tell someone that you think you can fit into your locker unless you want to be shoved inside.  (Even if it's your "best friend".)  And don't try to cover up an uncomfortable truth because when it bites you on the ass, it'll hurt harder than it would've if you just took the initial punishment.  And Shakespeare rocks, and John Lund is amazing, and the Mississippi River flows West to East through Winona, Minnesota.    But lots of people have a really bad time in public schools because, as studies show, girls are intimidated when boys are in class, and they don't get as much out of the educational experience.  So if the genders are separated, girls will get an improved educational experience.  Cut and dried, right?  Well, yeah, if what "educational experience" means is improved test scores.  But what if it means more than that?  What if it's about socialization, too?  What if it's about teaching boys to not be assholes?  What if it's about sharing the space that we're given with people of the opposite gender, and sharing ideas, and sharing opinions, and not so much about the final grade after all?  And if it's about more than just the grade, then are those all-girls' schools that result in better grades really giving those girls a better education?  Or even an adequate one?

       These are the sections of the book that I mentioned last Friday,  urlLink Remarkable Reads .  The idea of doing a list like this myself, or with a couple of friends, is intriguing.  Not sure if I could, even with help, come up with a "most Scottish" book, though.  Here are the adjectives used, anyway, for consideration...  The most memorable book I read  The loneliest book I read  The most enchanting book I read  The most important book I read  The most daunting book I read  The most resonant book I read  The most dangerous book I read  The wisest book I read  The classiest book I read  The most eloquent book I read  The maddest book I read The most double-d-daring book I read  The most hippest book I read  The most familiar book I read The most incomprehensible book I read  (quick answer:  urlLink I Served the King of England  by Bohumil Hrabal or  urlLink Light in August  by William Faulkner.)  The most devastating book I read The most apocalyptic book I read  The saddest book I read  The most fragile book I read  (what, literally?  I have a children's book called "Amy's Long Night" that I got when I was really little that's totally falling apart, but I doubt that that's the point)  The most beautiful book I read  The most tempting book I read  The most fearless book I read The most intuitive book I read The most Scottish book I read  The most technically elegant book I read The queerest book I read  The most exotic book I read  The most smokin' book I read The most seductive books I read  The most elegant book I read  The most surprising book I read The most disappointing book I read  The most unpleasant book I read  The most luminous book I read

       * Is 20 "too young" to get married?   !!   Thanks, John-the-weather-geek, for planting that in my subconscious for the whole afternoon.  * I bent back two of my almost non-existent fingernails today.  I'd almost think it wasn't possible.  * Meeting at NILS tomorrow morning, albeit not cataloging-related.  It's for the LSTA grant, it's required, and I think I'm supposed to bring something along.  Hmm.  Perhaps it would be best to determine what that is, so that if there's panicking to be done, I can do it now rather than in the morning while I drive.  * My head is pounding.  * I checked out two books today -  urlLink Virgin Territory , compiled by Cathy Alter, and  urlLink Little Children  by Tom Perrotta.  The first should be one of those wonderful "guys don't get it 'cause they're guys" books, and the second will slay me 'cause Perrotta's hilarious -  urlLink Joe College  had me snorting iced tea out my nose the whole time I was reading it, I was laughing so hard.    * Crap, I was going to write a serious discussion of Why I Am Not a Feminist tonight, but my head hurts too much to think straight.  Maybe tomorrow.  For now, it's peanut butter  urlLink M&M's  (magic food cure-all for headaches!) and a novel.    G'night.

       I took the job.  Did I mention that it's not really a different job, just my job, only "better"?  Yeah, my current/soon-to-be-former job has been part-time, and this job offer that I've been contemplating has been for a full-time version.  Salary, benefits.  Paid vacation from dreamland (relatively speaking).    I accepted it, and now I feel like a tiny little windsock, floating along on the prevailing breeze.  Yes, I needed the money, and no, there were no guarantees that if I hadn't taken it, that things would have worked out the way that I wanted them to in other directions.  So practically speaking, it's all fine.  But I still feel like there's a rock where my heart is supposed to be.  'Cause I know I didn't do the right thing.  Or maybe I did the "right" thing, but I didn't do what my heart was telling me to do.

       Background music: "The 'Driving Through the Carpal Tunnel' Mix", so named because I made it for my physical therapist on the occasion of my returning to his care when my wrists went bad.  Playlist as it changes throughout the post.   Song: "Together Forever" - Rick Astley   I am, for all intents and purposes, done with my thesis.  It's something to which I've been looking forward for, hmmm, 8 years.  So why do I feel so out of sorts and  crappy  today?  I feel as if I've just lost the protection of something necessary, like when it's raining hard but you've been able to stay under awnings but then there's no more awning left.  You've been wet all along, and grumpy, and you went out of your way and too slowly for your taste, but you weren't drenched.  Now you're drenched and your clothes are sticky...   Song: "Norwegian Wood" - Trio Rococo   ...and you realize that you'd liked that protection before.  Maybe that doesn't make sense to anyone else.  I know that I spent a lot of time writing about how miserable I was to be still working on it, and how much I wanted to be done with it.  But now that it's done, where am I?   What  am I?  "I need to work on my thesis" was a convenient excuse against  anything  that I didn't want to do.  No one's going to argue with that.  Maybe this is why I've been, at first subconsciously but with increasing awareness, considering Who I Am and...   Song: "Go Insane" - Lindsey Buckingham   ...What I Am.  For instance, there's the job issue.  What's really at stake, 5.5 more hours per week of work?  Ha, it's not like I don't already do 5.5 hours of "free" work for the library each week anyway with the review journals that I read at home, the email that I answer in the evening, or the stuff that I deal with during lunch.  The real conundrum is whether I want to self-identify as a  librarian .  Is  that  who I am?  Is that  what  I am?  It was a lot easier to give an unequivocal No when...   Song: "Desire" - U2   ...I spent all my free time thinking about or working on something more important than my work - my education.  So what if I never planned to use it for anything productive - it's theoretically more important, and no one argues with that.  So I never felt like I had to explain it.  But now, there's nothing behind which to hide.  Am I, or am I not?    Does it really matter, for fuck's sake?  I should just take the money and shut the hell up.    Ah, but that denies the rest of the question.  If I don't take the job - and it's as simple as this - my best friend in the entire world, the person who I would literally do  anything  for, will have a job.   Song: "One in a Million" - the Romantics   My life was once very, very easy.  I had casual friends with whom I shared very few entanglements.  I was Work Friends with person #1, Bar Friends with person #2, Book Friends with person #3, and so on.  Now that's totally changed and I'm upside down over it.  This sense of responsibility doesn't mesh well with my inherent selfishness (see the post from last Friday - the Dante's Inferno Test - if you're unconvinced about my relative egocentricity).    How do I reconcile this?  She needs a job.  She wants this particular job.  She'd do extremely well in this particular position, which is open-ended; there's a decent chance that it would expand very quickly into something for which she's been preparing recently.  If she had the job, it would make my job so much easier, I can't fathom the change.  Problems: I need the money.   Badly.   I mean, $##,### badly.  And I can't help but think that if I didn't take it, at some point, I'd be thinking, "Fuck, I needed that money."  Regardless of the extremely good reason that I have for not taking it.  And I can't help but think that, if I didn't take it, at some point she'd be thinking, "Stupid fuck needed the money and 'gave' me the job instead."   Song: "People are Strange" - The Doors   This is too much to think about.  Must think of something else.  * Martha Stewart.  Guilty on all counts.  As far as I can tell, there is one class of person who thinks she got the shaft: educated women of my mom's age, who argue that she's being made an example of to the exception of the men who are let alone.  Well, duh.  Is this surprising to any females of my age...   Song: "Laid" - James   ...and younger?  It's a Man's World, people.  History is about men - that's why there's Women's History.  Fiction is about men - that's why there's Women's Fiction and Chick Lit.  So blah blah, misogyny, yadda yadda.  Does any of this explain away the fact that Martha Stewart engaged in criminal activity, was charged, and was subsequently found guilty?  Nope.  She's a felon, people.  I don't care whether she's female, male or "other"; white, black or anything else; 20, 100, or someplace in between.  I haven't been keeping up on the trial beyond the headlines, but I'm assuming there was an Intent element in at least some of her crimes; there usually is in felonies.  She knew what she was doing was wrong, and she did it anyway.  No sympathy just 'cause she's a chick - she gives women a bad name.   Song: "Hold Back the Rain" - Duran Duran   * Paper Products.  The library has a contract with a paper product delivery service.  They bring in those HUGE rolls of toilet paper (a foot wide?) and paper towels that pull down - they look like paper tornadoes - and the like.  They don't bring the stuff nearly often enough, but that's probably our fault for not setting up the contract correctly.  Anyway, when they deliver, the man taps on the door of the restrooms and calls out the name of the company before entering, so that if there's anyone inside they'll let him know he's in there.  Only, what he's yelling out doesn't make any sense.  "CINTAS!"  Who the fuck knows what "Cintas" is?  Him, yes.  The library director, yes.  Anyone else?  Can I see a show of hands?  Tell me, if you were in the restroom of a public library, doing your business, and someone tapped on the outside door (there are stalls with doors) and yelled "CINTAS!", would you know that it was someone delivering TP or paper toweling and you should call out that you were inside...   Song: "The Arms of Orion" - Prince   ...so he wouldn't come in?  Or would you think it was (a) someone saying a Spanish word you didn't know, (b) a homeless person spouting gibberish, or (c) nothing you needed to bother yourself with?  It  slays  me.  "CINTAS."  *  urlLink Lost in Translation .  Saw it last weekend after egg rolling.  I hadn't heard anything about it before seeing it - I didn't know who was in it beyond  urlLink Bill Murray , what it was about except that it wasn't slapstick.  Secret truth about me: I'm not a "movie person".  I enjoy movies, but it never occurs to me to watch them unless someone else brings it up.  I'd so much rather read or talk with someone.  Not sure why, really, since my dad and I used to watch movies together all the time.  There are stories there which I will share another time.  Anyway,  Lost in Translation .  I enjoyed it.  A lot.  On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest, I'd say it was an 8 at least.  Bill Murray is a great actor, and that's something I wouldn't have said before even though I've loved some of his movies (particularly  urlLink Caddyshack , which I think is fucking genius.  Maybe I'm a guy when I watch movies?).  Giovanni Ribisi is...   Song: "How's It Going to Be" - Third Eye Blind   ...discomforting.  Is that a word?  If not, perhaps "uncomfortable" would do, but it's not as precise as I'd like.  He makes  me  uncomfortable.  I don't think I could be in a room with him.  Back to the movie - I don't have a fascination with Asia.  Not at all.  Does that make me anti-modern?  It's  the thang  in History programs for women to be interested in Women's History and GLTB and Asian History.  Anything "traditionally underrepresented".  Well, fuck that.  Another area of my life in which maybe I'm a guy.  The more dead white guys who happened to be generals, talking about war, the better.  So I wasn't immediately captured by the romance of Japan, which I think put me more inside the characters than was the case for others with whom I watched.  Perhaps that was a benefit for me.  The sensation of feeling lost.  I don't want to give too much away.  I'll just generally, vaguely recommend it, and leave it at that.  If anyone wants to discuss the finer points, email me.   Song: "Unbelievable" - EMF   This is an insanely long post.  11 songs so far.  6 more to go.  I might as well keep going.  * BlogTricks is revealing hilarious things to me.  The following two items appeared this morning:  ** Yahoo! France - Resultats de recherche pour valera underwear men string  Valera underwear?  BWA-ha-ha-ha-ha!  * I'm going to start doing book reviews on a regular basis of anything that I finish reading.  If it becomes tedious,    Song: "Working for the Weekend" - Loverboy   I might create a separate blog for it.  For now, though, I think I'm too busy to read enough that it'll matter.  Right now I've got at least 3 books going that I can think of off the top of my head.   urlLink The Language of Good-bye  (Maribeth Fischer),  urlLink Book Lust  (Nancy Pearl) and a romance novel that will be reviewed as always on  urlLink Romantic Nonsense .  Hey, one benefit of being out from under the thumb of my thesis is having the intellectual freedom to read nonfiction again without confusing myself terribly.  Ironically, the topic that's been interesting me the most lately is  urlLink Wilhelm Canaris .  You can pull the girl out of German history, but....  I also cataloged a fascinating-looking book the other day:  urlLink Remarkable Reads , edited by J. Peder Zane.  Here's a short review, copied from  urlLink Amazon :   Song: "You're My Best Friend" - Queen   From  urlLink Booklist  Curious about what writers read and how books have influenced them, Zane, book review editor for the  Raleigh News & Observer,  invited 34 writers to contribute essays launched by the request that they fill in the blank: "the most ______ book I ever read." Zane's challenge elicited truly eye-opening responses about the most memorable, enchanting, dangerous, daunting, exotic, devastating, smokin', and luminous books read by the likes of Bebe Moore Campbell ( The Cat in the Hat,  by Dr. Seuss), Charles Frazier ( The Tarahumara,  by Antonin Artaud), and Lee Smith ( The Little Locksmith,  by Katharine Butler Hathaway). Much of the pleasure of this exciting little volume is found in the surprising selections of the contributors and in the diverse sensibilities of the contributors themselves, a notable list that also includes Lydia Millet, whose essay on  The War with the Newts  by Karel Capek, is a knockout; nature writer Scott Weidensaul on Aldo Leopold's  A Sand County Almanac;  and Canadian novelist Elizabeth Hay on Pauline Kael. Fresh and thought-provoking, this anthology is pure catnip for book lovers. Donna Seaman Copyright © American Library Association. All rights reserved    Song: "Joy to the World" - Three Dog Night   I'd like to try a smaller version of that on the blog sometime.  I wonder if I can come up with an example for each of the adjectives the authors used?  Maybe it can be a group project with someone else.  I can think of one or two other people who might be interested.  I could compile.   Song: "Drive" - The Cars  (the gap between songs is small because I was adding links)  * Because Comcast was down yesterday, I didn't send a message to my committee saying that the thesis was on its way.  I got a rather snippy message from my advisor this morning reminding me that the grad school's deadline is 15 March, so the sooner they get it and start reading, the better.  I wrote back right away (well, his message was posted at 9-something and I got up at 11-something, so it was as right-away as could be), to the entire committee.  I explained that I hadn't included a cover letter when I mailed the document because they already have enough to read (ha ha - what a lame attempt at humor).  I told them how it's being shipped and when it'll be there.  I thanked them for the opportunity to make the revisions (gag) and thanked them again for being on the committee (gag).  I said that I look forward to hearing from them when they've read this version.  Advisor wrote back right away and - get this - thanked me for the message, saying that they're all looking forward to getting it.  Then he ruined whatever good feeling he'd created by saying, "And I'm sure it's much better after significant revision."   Song: "The Weakness in Me" - Joan Armatrading   Lousy bastard.  If he'd been enough of an advisor to keep me apprised of its crappiness all along, we'd have not been left to this mess.  Ah, well.  Must remain calm about it.  It's literally in their hands now.  * I didn't go to work today, and I didn't get a massage.  To be honest, I haven't done much of anything.  Slept 'til 11:15 or so.  Woke up with a stiff neck and my legs trapped under the weight of two cats.  Hobbes was under all the blankets but on top of the flat sheet, and Pooke was on top of the whole thing, on my feet.  Ate breakfast (Frosted Mini Wheats - surely the best food ever).  Made a CD mix of...   Song: "When I Fall in Love" - Rick Astley   ...George Michael songs for Tara.  Wrote some long-overdue email.  Had a weird lunch (pasta with butter and  urlLink Adobo  with  urlLink Blackberry Sage tea ).  RSVP'd for a reception at the law school, in the negative.  Why would anyone waste a Sunday afternoon munching stale crackers and rubbery cheese and drinking box wine with stodgy, assholish law profs and former so-called friends?  Borrrr-ring!  Then I sat down to write a quick blog post.  This is insanely long.  I had no idea how long this CD was when I started!  At least I remembered to turn on my  urlLink paraffin wax  this morning.  My hands are dry from processing, and waxing them helps a lot.  It feels wonderful, too.  The wax takes forever to melt, though, because I have the monstrously large machine.    Time to fold clean laundry and contemplate dinner.

       Ah, the road to true love - and theses - never runs smooth.  Up 'til 3:00 proofreading.  Pulled out some truly horrendous grammatical gems, too.  But it's in the mail (guaranteed to arrive by noon Friday) so all's well on that front.  For now, eh?  I've signed up for  urlLink BlogTricks , a nifty system for tracking referrers to the blog.  I found it while floundering around last night online.  I caught up on the  urlLink Unshelved  strips that I hadn't read, then paged through the  urlLink Overdue Media blog .  The strip's creators mentioned  urlLink BlogTricks  and I decided to check it out.  Not what I should've been doing at 1:30 in the morning, but... any port in a storm, I guess.  The new feature is terrifically easy to set up and use and looks nice.  (A much better experience than a use-counter that shall remain nameless -  for now! )  I was going to catch up on my email (there are 16 messages in my inbox - unbelievable) but Comcast (stupid assholes) was upgrading their server today.  Yeah, right.  When I logged in this morning, they'd completely changed the interface.  When I tried again around 2:00 this afternoon, it was down because of the "upgrade" (i.e. something went screwy with the new interface).  I could log in far enough to see that I had messages, but couldn't access them.  Finally got in at 10:15.  Back to the old interface.  Have they ever heard of beta testing?  They might want to look into it.  Guess I'll catch up on that email...tomorrow.  Also considered going in for an extra day of work tomorrow.  Why not, after all, since I don't have anything tying me home - no thesis to edit (yay!).  But I think I am too tired, and deserve a day off, so I'm going to try to stay home.  If I get too bored or feel too restless I'll go in.  God knows there's enough for me to do there if I do go.    I need to decide about the job by Monday.  Here's the decision: do I want to keep my flexible 32 hours/week but not an overwhelming amount of money?  Or do I want a few more hours (37.5) and quite a bit more money, but also a lot more responsibility and less flexibility?  It's not a lot more time to put in, really, than I am now.  And the money would help a lot.  But there's more to consider and I know that I'm trying to simplify the real issue at stake.  Ah, no one can decide this for me.  I have to grow up sometime.  Maybe I'll try to get an appointment for a  urlLink massage  tomorrow.  That would be the perfect end to a good week, and it might help clear my head for decision-making.

       My thesis is done!  Well, that's not exactly true.  I can hope it's true, but here's the facts: I finished doing the hand-editing last night (with a highlighter and a pen on a printed copy) around 11:45.  I worked a half-day today and came home so I could do the changes to the document in Word.  It took forever because I spent a lot more time reading it than I'd expected, but it was necessary.  So I just finished.  FINISHED!  And it's printing.  The Apple Personal LaserWriter 300 is already moaning and it's only 16 pages into the text (plus iv pages of preliminary matter).  It's going to be miserable and screaming after the 103rd page of the 3rd copy.  Ah, well, I don't care.    I'm done!  Bliss.  Intellectual, physical, complete and total happiness.    Here's what happens now.  I send it to the department, c/o my advisor.  He distributes the copies to the other 2 committee members.  They read it and (with any luck) think it's good enough to sign off on.  (Why does that sentence make academic sense when it's grammatically horrid?)  Then one of their copies goes to the department head, who reads it and also signs the Approval Form.  In the mean time, advisor will have emailed me to let me know (a) that it's fabu, (b) that I don't have to drive to MI to hand-deliver the thing to the grad school, (c) to send the forms for the grad school to the History dept. ASAP.  So the dept head reads and signs, the forms arrive, and someone (advisor? secretary?) schleps it to The Graduate School, whereupon it is entered into the abyss of Received Theses prior to the 15 March deadline, guaranteeing that I graduate in April.  The Grad school reader reads it and we email comments and edits (grammar, punctuation, other nitpicky shit) back and forth until they're satisfied.  I pay the copyright fee, the microfilm fee, the binding fee, the tassel fee, blah blah blah.  I ship them however many copies I want to have bound, along with my copyright form.  They, eventually, ship one back.  And then, eventually, my Masters of Art degree in History, with an emphasis in Modern Europe.  But for now, it seems very much like it's over, and I could not be happier.

       * The weather's been perfect for two days - sunny, warm but not too hot for this time of year, and breezy.  Today it's cloudy, rainy and blah.  Much like my mood.  * On my way to a meeting yesterday afternoon, late, almost running out of my office, scooted past the copy machine and nearly slammed into...the law prof whom I'd libelled earlier in this venue.  I managed to avoid him at the last moment but it was a very near thing.  I was thankful that my hair's quite different than the last time he saw me.  Also think that I carry myself in a different way - more self-assured, shoulders back, confident? - than I had around graduation time from law school.  If he'd realized it was me (and if indeed he was aware of the highly improper statements I'd made about him here), he'd not have hesitated to confront me.  And pursue it.  I got lucky.  * I'm putting together some mix CDs at home in the evenings, 1 each for 4 friends.  It's confusing because the people are quite different and I want them hand-crafted to their personalities and my friendship with them.  Currently listening to Sister Hazel's  urlLink Somewhere More Familiar  because I think I want to use something from it for at least one of them.  I hope they turn out as good in reality as they seem to be going together on paper.  * Tell me, is The Rock really so  abhorrent  to men?  I've had an embarrassingly long ongoing discussion about him with perhaps my most erudite friend (now  there's  a standard up to which to live!) and he seems truly appalled at my interest in him (The Rock, that is, not the friend, with whom I have only friendship feelings but of very long standing and great warmth so as to include wife, brother, parents, cat, fish, etc.).  I just think that The Rock is interesting and a good actor - improving quite a bit from  urlLink The Scorpion King  to  urlLink The Rundown , and I'm looking forward to seeing if the trend continues in  urlLink Walking Tall .  * A reader review of  urlLink Monkey Dancing: A Father, Two Kids, and a Journey to the Ends of the Earth  on Amazon.com:    ***** More Monkeys, Less Pickles, April 26, 2004  Reviewer: Dipper Lips from Medusa, NY USA   Dipper see more monkeys. Dipper tippy. Dipper dance with dreamy monkeys. Sweet ballerina monquita dance for Dipper. Book give me monkeymares.    * Finally, the  urlLink Thursday Threesome  (so I'm late - sue me) from yesterday, via  urlLink Lora :  ::Goodie Two Shoes::   Onesome: Goodie --  What is your favorite "goodie" you treat yourself to when you've finished a project or maybe even just survived a long day? Ice cream? ...a long bath? ...a good book?   If what I've survived is something small, like a long but regular day, the reward is a good book.  If it's something truly heinous, the reward must be something more substantial.  I'm fond of spontaneous online shopping - for myself or someone else.     Twosome: Two --  Quick! Two things that make you smile! No thinking, just write!  Feathers & Cotton Candy.   Threesome: Shoes --  ...and how about your favorite pair of shoes? You know, the ones you look for an occasion to wear! (Yes, guys that ratty pair of tennis shoes does count...)  I bought a pair of  urlLink dirty bucks  from Bass several years ago.  I love the way they look on my feet and I get nothing but compliments when I'm wearing them, but they're incredibly uncomfortable.  I do have a tendency to wear them when I want to be noticed, though, so I reserve them as if they have magical powers...and they do.

       ...you'll love this!  Thanks to Annie @  urlLink The Catalogue Blog  - the  urlLink New England School of Law's catalog  can be scoped by   color  !  That's for those times when you remember that the book is blue, but you can't think of the title.  I'm rolling on the floor laughing right now.  Leave it to a law librarian to do something that hilarious.  Nothing better to do with one's overpaid ass than to index by color!  And now, just for fun,  urlLink The Friday Five  from Friday, November 21, 2003:   1. List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year.  I. Graduate. II. Deal with The Problem (JCL knows) one way or the other. III. Start writing. IV. Pay, in full, any one of my bills. V. Have I mentioned, start writing?   2. List five people you've lost contact with that you'd like to hear from again.  I. Andrew Marr. II. Sara Squires and associated siblings. III. Chris Kaufmann. IV. Becky Smail. V. N.   3. List five things you'd like to learn how to do.  I. Travel well (i.e. without giving in to anxiety about it beforehand, or discomfort while in the process) II. Make spritz cookies (T inspires me) III. Make money hand over fist, at least for some tiny chunk of my lifetime IV. Write fiction V. Make decisions without pulling the bandage too slowly   4. List five things you'd do if you won the lottery (no limit).  I. Buy an Alfa Romeo II. Pay off all my bills and those of all my friends (you'd know you were my friend 'cause I'd pay your bills) III. Give my parents money enough that they could say Fuck You to their jobs  and  their insurance companies, and never be beholden to any bureaucracy again IV. Endow scholarships in the names of the teachers who made a difference in my life V. Make some large donations in the name of some people I care a lot about for things like fiction collections at small public libraries and art history programs at state schools in the Midwest - places where money doesn't often flow, but where it could be well-used.   5. List five things you do that help you relax.  I. Read II. Drink III. Blog IV. Write letters/email/fiction V. Play with my cats

        Friday, 16 April 2004   We somehow managed to get up earlier than the day before, but laziness and indecision about what to wear, etc., meant leaving the hotel room around the same time (11:00) as we had on Thursday.  Breakfast from the Starbucks cart again, but we ate in the room thanks to Tara bopping down to pick it up while I showered and got ready.  (Blueberry muffin & orange juice for me, cheese danish and milk for her.)  I wore shorts and what may be my cutest but least "me" shirt, navy with short-sleeves and large (3"?) teal and aqua dots.  And  urlLink Band-Aid Blister Block , socks and regular (non-sandal) shoes - boo!  Tara wore jeans and a t-shirt and sandals.    I steeled my nerve and took the elevator - again, for what already seemed like the millionth time in the trip - from the 21st floor to the lobby.  We read out on the Riverwalk for a while, me with my shorts hiked up on my legs as far as possible.  I just wanted a little sun, you know.  Stupid, since I'm pale and the sun doesn't affect me well anyway, but it just felt soooo good!  Went out for lunch after a while at a funky bakery/lunch place just down the block from the hotel,  urlLink Don Pan International Bakery .  Fantastic food - I had a turkey sandwich made with hot turkey carved right in front of me.  I know, it's not exotic, but it was excellent.    After lunch Tara and I took a cab from the hotel to South Beach.  This  definitely  counts as an adventure.  Although I've taken taxis before, I've never actually run the process myself - there's always been someone else "in charge", making sure that the whole thing goes as planned, making sure we don't get screwed out of a bunch of money, figuring out the tip, etc.  This time, it was the blonde leading the blonde.  We gave the driver the address (well, the cross-streets) of the  urlLink Wolfsonian Museum : our first destination.  I wasn't stunned to discover that the driver was not conversational, but he didn't even appear to speak English.  T and I babbled all the way over, taking note of the cruise ships and the mansions (see, e.g.,  urlLink Fisher Island ) and wondering what the Wolfsonian was going to be like.  When we drove into Miami Beach itself, I was surprised by all the traffic - cars  everywhere!   We passed a vanload of college guys from Ontario.  I can't imagine making a drive like that.  You'd have to really, really like the people with whom you were riding.    The driver let us off in an unlikely spot but we paid him his $20 for 10 minutes of work and got out.  Surprisingly, he'd dropped us directly in front of the museum.  Happy, we went in.  After our eyes adjusted to the relative dark, we followed directions into the gift shop to pay our admission.  In response to me query, the clerk said, "You want to see the museum?  OK, and, what country are you from?"  I looked at him blankly for a moment before replying, "We're both from the United States."  He chucked, turned beet red, and said, "Ah, uh, I thought you were British because you have such pale  skin!   I'm so  sorry!"   T and I looked at each other, shrugged and said, "No problem."  Then we affected super-strong British accents and tormented him until we were through.  Tee hee.  Admission was $5.35 (tax?).  Exhibits started on the 4th floor, continuing to the 5th and 6th.  Elevator to the 4th floor.  General exhibit.  Some really interesting stuff.  Some bizarre stuff, like telephones from the 1950s.  Lots of what I'd call plain old crap that might be in a grandmother's basement waiting for a rummage sale.  A copy of Tales of Mystery and Imagination by Poe, upon which was this quotation by Thomas Bodkin, the illustrator: "This is not a book which can be safely shown to a child shortly before bedtime, nor, indeed, to any highly-strung adult."  I found a lamp that I desperately wanted.  Cast iron, I believe, with a swan body and a sort of serpent/vampire head, doing what I can only say looked like it was, er, sucking on a, er, protruberance, which was almost as large as its mouth.  Absolutely amazing.  What drives someone to create such a thing?  Up to the 5th floor.  Surprise: the limited-time exhibit called "Weapons of Mass Dissemination: The Propaganda of War".  Anti-war posters, mostly.  Some pro-war posters.  'How to use your gas mask' posters.  Lots of photographs of dead people, including murdered children.  Board games about war.  It was icky to say the least.  I was interested in it from a historical perspective but I think T would've gladly left after a moment or two.  Up to the 6th floor.  Could it get any worse?  Well, no, but it was not great.  Another limited-time exhibit, this one of Japanese woodcuts called "Tokyo: The Imperial Capital".  Not my cup of tea, let's say.  Woodcuts can be fascinating, but these were of truly dull subjects.  According to their website, "the exhibit features woodblock prints by Japanese artist Koizumi Kishio (1893-1945) as well as photos and documents that chronicle the Tokyo earthquake of 1923 and the social trends of the period from 1928 to 1940."  Snore.    Once we were through with the 6th floor, we couldn't wait to leave.  We went to the gift shop, but couldn't bring ourselves to buy anything.  We hadn't seen the wrestler statue that we'd been dying to see, and that's the logo of the museum, so it seemed sort of lame to buy a t-shirt with him on it.  Discouraged, we headed down the street.  We passed some interesting people and stores unlike anything I've seen in the [boring] Midwest.  A t-shirt shop that reminded me of The Philosopher - "Fuck Bush" and "Fuck War" t-shirts.  An Italian deli with  negroni  and  salumi , just like Molto Mario used to yap about.  Of course, all of the women we passed were wearing next to nothing, bikini tops with cups the size of a post-it note and shorts so short that, well, you get the idea.  And the men - some of them aren't worth mentioning, but the ones who were didn't notice us (or anyone of our gender, thank God for my ego) in the slightest.  It was people-watching on a grand scale.  And the stores - ah!  Kenneth Cole and Versace and...too much to look at, too many people, too many gorgeous cars and fascinating things.  It was cognitive dissonance but so appealing at the same time.  I felt torn in a hundred different directions.  When we finally wended our way to Ocean Drive, we could see the dunes in the distance, maybe 1/8 mile away, and smell the sea.  All that was left was crossing Ocean Dr. - a challenge in itself.  Once that was over, we debated actually going to the shore, since I had the blisters and would have to take off my shoes...it didn't take more than a couple of minutes to shut off the negativity, remove the shoes, and head up the sand toward the water.  The water - OH MY GOD, the water.  Gorgeous, gorgeous blue.  So pale, but still blue, not that gray of earlier in the spring.  Some seaweed, but not enough to be gross.  And it smelled salty but not fishy.  It was fucking fantastic.  I walked in right away.  T took some pictures and walked around a bit.  I just stood there, foot/ankle/calf/knee/over-the-knee deep in the ocean.  By that time, T was beside me but a little closer to shore.  And then - fuck, the tide started coming in.  Her jeans were rolled up and the cuffs got wet, but my shorts got wet toward the middle and I looked like I'd had an accident, but I didn't care.  It was amazingly lovely.  Just looking out on the ocean made a lot of stuff I've been carrying around fade a bit, you know?  That "things are bigger than me" thing.  And I was there with someone who I'd die for, so that made it all the better.    My mutual assent, and maybe even without saying anything, we walked back up the beach and to the faucet thing to clean off our feet and get in our shoes.  We walked down Ocean Drive a ways, away from the direction we'd come from.  Talking, looking around.  Some guys drove by in a car with a sunroof and the driver stuck his head out the top and yelled, "Show us your tits!"  I nearly died laughing, but I did it internally because T was really uncomfortable with the whole scenario.  The way I saw it, we were among about 2,000 people within a 5-block area.  If they'd seriously meant us any harm, we'd have had a dozen guys-with-families at our side in a second.  So it was just some harmless objectification.  Harmless and damned funny, because we were dressed like these crazy Midwesterners in shirts and shorts or jeans, even, and they are intrigued and want to see more, while the admittedly hotter girls who have the tans and the tight bodies in the bikinis weren't drawing their eye or their call.  Sociologically revealing - covering up does make them wonder what's beneath.  Shortly thereafter I hailed a cab.  T wasn't comfortable and it seemed to be time to get back.  We were hot and tired.  When we hopped in, we gave our direction and the driver - way more chatty than any thus far - asked, "Where's the party?"  That got things started.  He and I mildly flirted all the way back to the hotel, verbally bashing a guy in a Porsche for wearing a lame striped polo shirt (I said he looked like Elmo and our guy nearly drove off the road) and talking about the Cubs and the Marlins.  At one point, he actually said, "What's your sign?"  I thought I was going to faint - "Show us your tits" and "What's your sign" in one day!  I'm a Virgo but was born 2 weeks late, so I should've been a Leo.  If you believe in that, it could be a reason for my duplicity and lack of firm direction.    Back at the hotel.  Showered again, changed clothes.  Felt kind of hot.  Hmm, discovered the goddamned sunburn.  Yes, blisters and now sunburn.  Will I never learn?  My scalp (ah, the fair-haired!), my face (nose, cheekbones, chin), my left arm (closest to the sun each time we went outside to read), and both legs from the bottom of my shorts to the ankles.  Freakish and uncomfortable.  T had a little color but not nearly the frying that I'd gotten.  Out for dinner:  urlLink Lombardi's , the Italian restaurant at the Bayside Marketplace.   We ordered an appetizer, Mozzarella in Carozza, which turned out to be little mozzarella cheese sandwiches on white bread, breaded (with cheese-stick breading?) and deep-fried, served with marinara sauce, black olives and anchovies.  It tasted good, but it was obviously not a healthy dish.  At the same time, I ordered something totally out of left field and in honor of J. and H. - an Orange Martini.  I wanted something fruity but not too sweet and that's exactly what I got.  Absolut Ohranj vodka, Cointreau and a splash of orange juice for color.  It was the strongest sippin' drink I've ever had.  It could've peeled paint!  I drank it in deep slugs and felt very warm & fuzzy.    That wild, experimental drink made up for my basic dinner - a Pizza Margherita.  Fabulous version, but still pretty plain.  Dessert, shared with T, was a slice of chocolate cake which unfortunately contained cherries.  Blegh.  We ate the non-cherry parts.  After dinner, drinks at the hotel bar again, this time with my friend Joe from Toledo.  He and Tara had mojitos and I had a beer, probably an Amstel or Heineken.  It was Joe's first foray into the land of mojito and he wasn't uniformly taken with them; his initial reaction was, "I feel like I'm sucking a bush or something."  (Yeah, that was good enough to write down.)    Bed around 1:00, I think, after lots of reading in bed and yapping.  Nonspecific plans for Saturday, but it would be our last real day in Miami so we didn't want to waste it.

       Having done the Tens, I knew I was leaving out some of my favorite books based on my crazy ranking system.  Therefore, I spent a bit of time today while yapping with my parents, visiting from home, paging through my list and making notes which I'll copy below.  These are the nines.    ~  About the Author  by John Colapinto: pacing problems caused it to slip from a very credible 10 down to a really high 9.  If I had to try to describe it, I’d call it “funky modern suspense fiction”.  Think of it as an object lesson in telling the truth.  Surprising, enthralling, profound.  ~  All the Queen’s Men  by Linda Howard: suspense with romance, as opposed to romantic suspense.  It sounds like hair-splitting, but what I mean is that the taut suspense comes first throughout the book.  The well-rounded characters endure believable but spectacular struggles.  ~  Asking for Trouble  by Elizabeth Young: I picked this up thinking it was just-like-everything-else chick lit, just another  Bridget Jones .  It didn’t take long to discover that it was deeper than that.  Although there was a large number of Briticisms, it was fresh and fun and totally engrossing.  ~  The Bachelor’s Cat: A Love Story  by L.F. Hoffman: Very much a tear-jerker, but great.  Perfect for a  real  cat person - and romantic.  (Proof that I have a heart.)  ~  Bird by Bird  by Anne Lamott: A book about writing by one of my favorite writers.  It’s fascinating.  I read it with Post-It notes handy, so I could mark particularly salient insights.  ~  Breathing Lessons  by Anne Tyler: this won the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1989.  It may be her saddest book, but it’s sweet and thoughtful.    ~  Carry Me Across the Water  by Ethan Canin: I picked this up because my friend Debbie recommended it.  I’d also liked his earlier book  Blue River .  This is a sad little book – in trying to synthesize its purpose, I described it as “war memories, family, regrets, second chances.”  The language is especially lyrical.  ~  The Catsitters  by James Wolcott: Clever and surprising.  With a male protagonist.  How rare is that, in modern popular (albeit rather intellectual) fiction?  ~  The Dearly Departed  by Elinor Lipman: My introduction to Lipman.  It’s very good: snortingly funny in parts, sweet and painful in others.  I didn’t want it to end.    ~  Does She or Doesn’t She?  by Alisa Kwitney: The second of her books that I read, and at this moment I can’t figure out why that one ( The Dominant Blonde ) wasn’t a 10.  This is all about fantasies and how dangerous they can be.  I was disappointed by the ending, but only because it was more realistic than I’d hoped.  There were some really, really funny scenes in this book, and some things that were touching and sad, and the whole thing sparkled with a sort of freshness.  It was not like much of what I read – that’s a good thing.  ~  Dying to Please  by Linda Howard: bodyguard gets targeted for the murder of a client.  Scary, engrossing, and believable.  Although I could anticipate the ending, it still came as a great surprise.  ~  Edinburgh  by Alexander Chee: The main reason that I wanted to do this second list, because I thought that this book was so well done that I had to share it.  It’s painful, mostly, and sad.  With quirky language, beautiful and painful imagery, and thoroughly  real  characters.  Definitely not for every taste, but I really liked it.  The kind of book that, after you’ve read the last page, sits on your lap while you stare into the middle distance, thinking about how you may have changed from reading it.  ~  An Elegy for September  by John Treadwell Nichols: A fantastic, lovely, sad little book about a love found and given away.    ~  Ex Libris: Confessions of a Common Reader  by Anne Fadiman: For book nerds only.  I’m going to quote a couple of chunks of the Amazon.com review because they remind me of particular people or things.  For instance, John-the-Philosopher & family: “Fadiman is a woman who loves words; in ‘The Joy of Sesquipedalians’ (very long words), she describes an entire family besotted with them: ‘When I was growing up, not only did my family walk around spouting sesquipedalians, but we viewed all forms of intellectual competition as a sacrament, a kind of holy water as it were, to be slathered on at every opportunity.’”  Lora: “[The book includes such topics as] the pleasures of reading aloud (‘When you read silently, only the writer performs.  When you read aloud, the performance is collaborative’).”  Jenica: “Over the course of 18 charming essays Fadiman [includes subjects like the] “odd shelf” (“a small, mysterious corpus of volumes whose subject matter is completely unrelated to the rest of the library, yet which, upon closer inspection reveals a good deal about its owner”).  These are short, fascinating, smart essays that are both relaxing and thoughtful.  A 	great way to spend a weekend.  ~  Girls’ Poker Night  by Jill A. Davis: The author wrote for David Letterman, so she knows how to be funny.  What surprised me were the delicacy and the layering of real emotion.  It’s deceptively simple, both sad and funny, with very realistic characters.  Finally, it looks like “a chick book”, but it’s not.  ~  Innocents  by Cathy Coote: caveat – I actually gave this a rating of “maybe a 5?  maybe a 9?”, because it’s an unbelievably disturbing book.  Not for the obvious reasons - the subject matter, the callousness, or the frankness.  It’s disturbing because it’s so realistic.  The unnamed characters (all the better for not being saddled with names, a yoke of convention) fundamentally seethe with emotion - primarily tension, but also love (which he realizes, and fairly revels in, and she denies) and fear (one in the same?).  While I read this book, I loved it, and could not imagine not buying it and rereading it.  Once I had finished it, I cannot imagine ever even consciously picking it up again.  Not that it was not worth reading, but that it is both so disquieting and so unforgettable that I do not need to see it again.  She’s quite a writer - but can she publish something less troublesome?  ~  Into Love and Out Again  by Elinor Lipman: It shouldn’t come as a surprise that I’m a  huge  fan of Lipman’s.  This is a lovely group of short stories (some linked), thematically similar to the rest of her work.  It’s beautiful, heart-warming or -wrenching by turns.  Just so great.  ~  Jimmy’s Girl  by Stephanie Gertler: I loved this, in all its smarmy, oozy goodness.  It’s like an oversticky caramel roll – you know it’s not good for you and it’s probably going to send you into sugar shock or make you hyper, and eventually you’ll have diabetes and wonder if perhaps… but it’s so good that you just don’t care.  I thought it was sweet and sad.  Wistful, even.  It stuck with me for a long time.  ~  Julie and Romeo  by Jeanne Ray: This looks like a romance novel for the gray-haired set, but there’s more to it than that.  It’s a novel about the importance, or even the preeminence, of family, and how that can be a blessing and a burden not only for now but for the future.  If I’d really known what it was about, I probably wouldn’t have chosen it, which is too bad because it’s really very good.  The story is very tender and totally worth reading – and savoring  ~  Light, Coming Back  by Ann Wadsworth: Yes, this book is about lesbians.  But it’s not a “lesbian book”.  And it’s about so,  so ,  so  much more than that, that if you have any sort of soul at all you’ll feel pathetic for thinking you didn’t want to read it just because of that.  Now, that being said, The story is a short one and the telling long, but the language is so spectacular that it makes up for a lot.    ~  Love Among the Ruins  by Robert Clark: Star-crossed lovers reminisce.  Devastating, intricate and complex.  A little stilted at times, but overall a great story with an amazing ending that blew me away.  ~  Lucky Us  by Joan Silber: Melancholy and heartbreaking but so well written that it doesn’t leave a bad taste.  The characters are real and appealing.  The plot is unexpected but handled so delicately that it’s not uncomfortable.  I adored this book.  ~  Man and Boy  by Tony Parsons: a sad & hilarious & more sad book about growing up and making choices.  It’s absolutely cry-out-loud.  And funny.  ~  The Man Who Wrote the Book  by Erik Tarloff: hilarious, artful, romantic, painfully funny, painfully realistic although so fanciful.  This is not a book for the delicate – it’s about, among other things, the crafting of “utterly filthy porn.”  I’m not sure if I’ve ever laughed as hard as I did while reading this book.  ~  The Midnight Hour  by Karen Robards:  romantic suspense done extremely well.  A judge and a cop hook up (in every way) to stop a crazy teen from killing people.    ~  Mother of the Bride  by Lynn Michaels: In the same vein as  Julie & Romeo , this could have been “just” romance – but it’s more.  Cydney is Bebe’s aunt, and she steps in when Bebe gets set to marry the nephew of a reclusive author (think J.D. Salinger).  After realistic confrontation and through significant animosity, Cyd and the author, Angus, come to an understanding, and eventually more.  It’s lovely.  Smart, cute, funny and engaging.  Light, but long enough to really get into.  Much like Jennifer Crusie, although a bit smarter (and if you’ve read Jennifer Crusie you know what I mean).  ~  One Hundred Years of Solitude  by Gabriel Garcia Marquez: Others, including  urlLink Jenica , have described this book very well.  I’ll just say that I read it on the recommendation of an English professor who happens to be my personal literary guru, and he wasn’t wrong.  It was long, complicated, ethereal, fascinating, difficult, engrossing, lovely, weird, difficult to put down but also hard to get into, and a great deal of work, but finally just…beautiful.  ~  One on One  by Tabitha King: Stephen King’s wife, you know, the photographer.  Not a well-known novelist, but this is a genius book.  If I’d read this in high school I’d have hitchhiked to Maine to kiss her on the lips – she just  gets  it.  This book blew me away.  ~  Open Season  by Linda Howard: When librarians discuss fiction, the talk eventually turns to good books about librarians.  This is always my recommendation.  However, it’s more than that; it’s also just a good work of suspense.  Daisy’s the librarian in a small town, bored, and wants a guy.  She gets a makeover and goes out to the bars and has some fun, but sees something she shouldn’t.  And then she knows she’s in trouble; she’s getting followed, and she’s in serious danger – running for her life, even.  The story is funny and engaging.  The characters, while somewhat isolated, are believable and compelling.    ~  Other Peoples’ Marriages  by Rosie Jones: a tiny little soap opera.  I read this for the first time when I was about 15 and adored it.  Read it for the second time at around 20 and thought it was poignant and sweet.  Again a year ago and saw the seaminess and the pain.  It’s nuanced, but it’s also just a juicy read.  ~  Out of the Blue  by Sally Mandel: A big surprise.  Sad, heart-warming and nice but not sweet.  Good, real, flawed characters.  Swift plot.  Great scenes.  A thinker.  ~  Paradise County  by Karen Robards: romantic suspense on a horse ranch.  Doesn’t really sound like my kind of book, but this kicked ass.  It’s realistic and engaging – and scary!  Alex and Joe are real characters, complete with flaws.  Their romance is at least as enthralling as the suspense, which is absolutely gripping.  This is an  excellent  book.  ~  The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914  by David McCullough: I read this for a grad class called History of the Gilded Age.  Hated the class with a passion, but loved this book.  As one might guess from the title, it’s an epic (i.e. really, really long) history of the building of the Panama Canal.  It’s also an engrossing story about international relations, class issues, Central American geography, American and French domestic politics, and mud.  I’d have never thought to read this had it not been required for a class, but I’d be less of a person – and certainly less of a historian – in that case.    ~  Perfect Skin  by Nick Earls:  A young man is widowed.  He is left to raise his daughter alone, to continue his career (he’s a surgeon), to begin dating, and to go on with his life.  Difficult as it may be to imagine, this is fucking hilarious, fun and engrossing and snortingly dirty.  (Ugh, the scenes with Katie’s cat!)  It’s also sad and quirky and intriguing.  Heartbreaking.  ~  Rescue Me  by Gigi Levangie Grazer: Author is married to Brian Grazer, Ron Howard’s production partner.  I knew that before I read it, so I was reluctant to give her even one iota of credit for being a real author with “street cred”.  I figured she’d been published because someone needed Brian’s good graces.  So, with that in mind, here’s my review: this is substantial and engrossing.  The writing is interesting and intelligent.  The characters are surprising and thoughtful, treated lovingly by their crafter.  When I read the last page, I turned it because I wanted more.   She sold me, see?  It’s  that  good.  ~  River Teeth  by David James Duncan:  My earlier description of this reads, “kind of weird fictiony-nonfiction with lots about outdoor life and family.”  I love everything he writes, so what does it matter that it’s weird?  Here’s what the  Booklist  reviewer wrote, in total: “Though some readers dislike blurred lines between genres, Duncan's compilation of fiction and nonfiction is fluid and diverse, if not easily definable. His writings, which are sometimes narrative, mostly defy formal structure and are based on a metaphorical and realistic image he calls river teeth, or the knots in a tree that resist breakdown after the tree has fallen into a river and its main mass has disintegrated. Duncan claims that each person owns scores of river teeth and that they have the potential to guide, wound, and withstand time's erasure. Duncan's style is refreshing because of its intimate tone, the simultaneously lyrical and vernacular prose, vivid description, hilarious action, spirited movement, and poignant observation. ‘The Garbage Man's Daughter,’ the key piece, is a perfect re-creation of childhood perception. This emotional and witty portrait of a family's relationships offers an insightful commentary on a current and real threat to children: loss of childhood. Duncan deftly characterizes modern life and American culture--our fears, desires, and drives--revealing in these exquisite vignettes and tales all that shapes a life.”  ~  The Road to Wigan Pier  by George Orwell: Required for that History of Modern England course.  This was my introduction (as a serious student) to class consciousness and the  real  life of the  working  poor.  A sense of guilt and heightened awareness of differences permeated my approach to life for a time thereafter, thanks in large part to this book.  ~  The Side of the Angels  by Christina Bartolomeo: By the author of  Cupid and Diana .  It’s funny, sweet, hopeful, and engaging.  The plot is realistic and engrossing.  The characters are real - flawed but still very appealing.  Not as fabulous as Cupid & Diana, but it’s tough to catch lightning twice.  ~  Talking to Addison  by Jenny Colgan: I laughed out loud, really hard, through most of this book.  Over the last 20 pages, I cried almost as hard.  It’s difficult to explain why this was so affecting.  It’s not really so  Bridget Jones -esque, although they’re British and 30-ish and unmarried.  It’s much more of a character study of Addison, through Holly’s eyes.  He’s an amazing person, really intriguing.  And it’s a pretty amazing book, too.  ~  Ten Things I Wish I’d Known Before I Went Out Into the Real World  by Maria Shriver: I will not get into the politics issue – this was just an interesting, quick read about things to think about when making decisions.  It was not preachy or condescending, and I found it to be worth the time.  ~  War Against the Animals  by Paul Russell:  I read this because I am drawn to Russell’s writing after having read and been horribly freaked out by  The Coming Storm .  And, over time, I have come to appreciate that book much more than I had immediately after I read it.  Anyway, the main character of this book, Cameron, is difficult to fully admire, as he’s desperately trying to fade into the scenery after the death of the person he thinks is the love of his life, Toby, and the breakup of his long-term relationship with Dan.  However, his actions are well-grounded and he’s sensitive and logical, so it’s comfortable and pleasing to be with him and to learn about him.  Jesse, another major character, is disturbing but so attractive that one cannot not watch – like a car crash that’s about to happen.  He’s both reckless and too careful, and seems doomed (or damned?) for each.  Their relationship is fragile and beautiful but also painful and in some ways irritating.  The third of the primary characters, Kyle, is so obnoxious that one wishes he would simply cease to be, but he is the perfect foil to the others’ senses of self.  It’s a really wonderful story.  ~  The Way Men Act  by Elinor Lipman: Yup, another Lipman.  Very good!  On a par with  The Dearly Departed  and  The Inn at Lake Devine .  Fascinating and touching, sweet without being sticky.  Nice.  ~  Whispers at Midnight  by Karen Robards: This is the scariest of all the Robards books I’ve read.  Incredibly engrossing – I think I read it in less than a day.  Great characters, action, and language - very good.  A little on the dirty side, but it works with the story.  I had no complaints there.

       See  urlLink Jenica's blog  for the whys & wherefores.  These are just some funny examples of quotations translated into different languages 10 times, the last being English again.  "Get it down, girl.  Get it all down and write as fast as you can."  (Allen Ginsberg)    It kills to him, girl. It obtains it that all the drinks and write fastly therefore, as you can.   "...even emptiness has its own weight."  (Maribeth Fischer)   the uniform emptiness as soon as it has the weight of the relative   "Sixteen is absolutely the worst age because what you want and what you cannot have are exactly the same thing."  (unknown)  Sixteen is the age defective, because which to wish and to which you he cannot have, you are exactly absolute who are the same thing.

        urlLink The Color Quiz    Your Existing Situation    Working to improve her image in the eyes of others in order to obtain their compliance and agreement with her needs and wishes.     Your Stress Sources    Has an unsatisfied need to ally herself with others whose standards are as high as her own, and to stand out from the herd. This desire for preeminence isolates her and inhibits her readiness to give herself freely. While she wants to surrender and let herself go, she regards this as a weakness which must be resisted. This self-restraint, she feels, will lift her above the rank and file and ensure recognition as a unique and distinctive personality.     Your Restrained Characteristics    Wants to broaden her fields of activity and insists that her hopes and ideas are realistic. Distressed by the fear that she may be prevented from doing what she wants; needs both peaceful conditions and quiet reassurance to restore her confidence. Feels that things stand in her way, that circumstances are forcing her to compromise and forgo some pleasures for the time being.     Your Desired Objective    Feels exhausted by conflict and quarreling and desires protection from them. Needs peaceful conditions and a tranquil environment in which to relax and recover.     Your Actual Problem    The unsatisfied desire to be respected, to stand out from amongst her friends, is causing some anxiety. As a result, normal gregariousness is suppressed and she refuses to allow herself to become involved, or to participate with others in their ordinary activities.    Sorry, but this doesn't sound like me at all, particularly the Restrained Characteristics.  If anyone else takes this, I'd be interested in knowing the results and your feelings about their accuracy.

       Yeah, too much meming (memeing? yargh, that was hard to type) lately - Drew's right.  (And I was tempted to link to Drew, but that would be particularly ironical given the latest statements from him and others on that regard, so I'll abstain.  And yes, I do know that "ironical" is not a word, but I like it, so I'll use it.  Consider it - like "prehaps" - the flag I'm plantin' in blogworld.)  However, there are some things that need to be shared.  I'll get that out in this first paragraph and then move on to the more informative bit.  First, the  urlLink Color Test .  It's short and interesting, and I did better at it than anyone else in my family.  Next,  urlLink Kitty Clothes .  It's Japanese, and you must see to believe (but if you're not a "cat person" you won't likely care a whit, or you'll just find it really fucked up).  Finally, a rerun because I loved it, the  urlLink Dishonest Dubya doll , complete with Pretzel Horking technology.    Now, day 2 of the Miami Experience.   Thursday, 15 April 2004  Woke up very late.  Nearly 10:30.  Tara hadn't been awake for long before I awoke, which is surprising since she's more of a morning person and less of a slugabed than I am.  It took quite a while for us to prepare for the day, over coffee for her and tea for me via the in-room coffee pot.  We finally dragged ourselves down to the hotel lobby by 11:10.  Breakfast from the Starbucks cart.  Apple danish and milk for me, banana nut muffin and milk for her.  We people-watched as we ate and I realized the date, thinking that it was Jay Klagge's birthday.  34 today.  (Later remembered that it was the 5th, not the 15th.  Not bad for someone I haven't seen since '88 or so.)  Our plan was to walk from the hotel to "someplace interesting."  Not much of a plan, really.  We had 2 guidebooks -  urlLink Frommer's South Florida  and  urlLink Top 10 Miami & the Keys .  Lacking any real sense of drive, though, we just eavesdropped on a couple of women who were speaking with the concierge and decided to follow them to Bayfront Park and the Bayside Marketplace.  After a moment of confusion outside the hotel (surrounded by a hell of a lot of really tall buildings and streets numbered both NS and EW!), we headed in the correct direction.  I was wearing shorts, a t-shirt, and Birkies.  Tara was dressed more grown-uppish but less tropical vacationish in short-cropped pants and a mid-sleeve shirt.  And sunglasses for both of us, because it was gorgeously bright & sunny and perfectly warm, about 70°.    The park was only about 6 blocks from the hotel, through a fairly busy chunk of the downtown/Little Havana section of Miami.  It was  glorious  to be out in the middle of the day and have nowhere to be, no worries, just to be wandering around.  And there's no one on earth I'd have rather been there with.  Tara's the perfect person for me to travel with - her organization is the perfect counterpoint to my slack-assedness, while my blase' response to the stranger element gets her to do some things she might not have done before.    More about that on a later day.  We got to the park around 12:00, I'd guess.  The ocean: beautiful.  Cornflower-blue and quite still there, protected by the barrier islands.  The park is nice, too, but nothing spectacular in comparison to the water (at least for aMidwesternerr who'd only seen the ocean  once  before that.  How sad is that to admit?).  Tara took some pictures; I'd left my camera at the hotel for no good reason.  There was a tiny beach but we didn't take off our shoes and walk on it.  We discussed the merits of cruise ships.  There was a gambling boat moored there, which offered no appeal to either of us (as far as I could tell).  The Bayside Marketplace.  If I recall correctly, the guidebook referred to it as "tacky and touristy".  That it was.  The first establishment I could see was Hooters.  We wandered the shops.  The first thing I looked at in the first store we entered, I should have purchased, but I didn't want to start a flood of buying that I couldn't stop.  Regrets....  It was a store that sold mostly cotton clothes.  Males reading this are probably thinking, "Lame."  Or, perhaps, "What?"  Women are nodding.  Anyway, cotton clothes, chunky bead jewelry, large floppy hats.  We tried on hats.  My chipmunk cheeks swelled to mump proportions with the addition of those damned hats, which is too bad 'cause I really liked a couple of them.  Damned hats.  The thing that I wanted was a tiny box, about 3" square, covered with shiny purple and amber beads.  I don't think I've written before about my box collection and I'm not going to get into it in detail now, but suffice it to say, I like tiny boxes for no purpose other than that they're cute.  There's a shelf on the wall over my head right now that holds 13 of them.  The purple one would have been perfect.  But like I said, I didn't want to just spend all my time in Miami buying stuff, so I didn't get it.  It was a significant decision.  Some of the shops at Bayside are regular walls-and-doors stores, and some are carts set up on a sort of patio.  We wandered through a large number of them before coming to a cart of typical tacky tourist stuff.  I bought some postcards and an extremely tasteless but still somehow appealing shotglass in the shape of a sort of totem, creamy beige with a lavender overlay.  The brand-name is "Chiki Tiki."  The price, with tax, was $4.27, and I handed the clerk a five-dollar bill.  It was 12:30 or so, so it wasn't as if she'd been making change for hours and could have been out, but she said, "Do you have the 27 cents?"  At times like that, I'm always tempted to say, "It's legal tender.  Accept it.  Make change - it's your job."  But that would incredibly rude and I couldn't do it, and I do understand why she asked, so I looked, but I only had quarters.  Tara had a couple of pennies, though, and we made the change.  So I'd given her $5.27.  The clerk then, no more than a minute after having asked for exact change, gave me $.98 in return.  Before I could even open my mouth, but after she'd put the change in my hand, she said, "Oh, you gave me $.27, right."  She handed me a dollar and took the change out of my hand.  I just nodded, took my bag, and walked away.   Weird .  Too much sun on a daily basis?  Lunchtime.  Hooters?  As if.  There was an Italian place, but it looked too upscale (read: expensive) for our needs at that time.  There was a Spanish place, but they advertised paella.  Seemed somehow wrong, particularly since Tara and I have previous issues with paella (and the "whipping up" thereof).  I'm tensing now, preparing for the beatings, when I admit that we went to...the Hard Rock Cafe.  Hey, I've never been to one before, so it  was  a new experience.  Right?  Oh, forget it, I'm not even going to try and make excuses.  But we were hungry and it was there.  The place was  ginormous .  Tara got a non-alcy drink, but I had a Heineken.  She had a Cobb salad, but I had the Pig Sandwich.  That's pulled pork with vinegar BBQ sauce, with fries.  Sides of BBQ beans and cole slaw.  The waitress tried to cajole me into jazzing it up into the Dirty Pig by adding grilled onions and cheese, but I prefer a clean pig, thanks.  Tara's salad was easily enough for four people to eat as a meal.  It was huge.  And frozen!  The lettuce was frozen!  My sandwich probably weighed 2 pounds, but it was hot and tasty.  I prefer non-vinegar BBQ sauce (does that make me more Memphis than Texas, or the other way around?), but I was in hog heaven.  Pun intended.  The beer was perfect with it, too.  The overall experience of the restaurant was not overly positive, though.  It was insanely loud, to the point that we had our fingers in our ears as we  ran  out after we paid.  Our waitress was one of those overly-chipper Pollyanna freaks who wants to make your experience tres fun, so she delivered many meals on her own head.  Yes, she'd bring out a plate of food on her  head .  And she wouldn't just pull it off and set it on the table - she'd make the victim take it off her head themselves!  Had she done it to me, I'd have just picked up a fry and started eating with it on her head.  No wonder she didn't try it with us....  Weirdo.  There as an extremely odd, er, painted ceiling in the place, too.  Sort of stylized cupids and dogs in a dome, surrounded by dogs and robot heads.  At least one of the cupids had a sprinkler-head for a belly-button.  (Although, each time I've talked about this, it's sounded like a dream.  Can it be possible that it was true?  I  can't  have made this up.  And I only had  1  beer.)  I'd vaguely planned to get a shot glass and the typical Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt, but I decided after we'd paid and peed that it was just time to go.    A leisurely walk back to the hotel took us past a horrifying bookstore.  Horrifying?  A bookstore?  Yes - the bookstore that would make any librarian (or book lover, really) cringe.  It was mayhem - books in no particular order, Spanish mixed with English, on end and on their sides, some back-to-front, and even a bunch of them upside down.  Tara suggested that we offer our services in shelving for a couple of hours.  It hurt too much to stay there, even to browse; we left after about 3 minutes.  Back to the hotel, where I discovered...3 blisters.  Yes, I had blisters all over my feet, on what was essentially the first real day of the trip.  I felt like a stupid little fuck, although really the most salient feeling was  pain  - they  hurt , since my feet were all Midwest-winter soft.  I had brought along a shitload of bandaids and I commenced applying them immediately.  Unfortunately, they rolled off almost as quickly.  We determined that we'd passed a Walgreen's after leaving the bookstore - we would return in the morning.  We sat on the Riverwalk outside in the late afternoon, reading our books and watching the Miami River go by.  We talked a little, but it was mostly silent contemplation and enjoyment of the sun, the water, the heat, the company, and the novelty of no requirements.    Dinner in the hotel bar, called "Currents".  Very swankish, but with a Cuban flair.  Tara was drinking Mojitos, also called "Cuban Temptation" in the menu - Bacardi, fresh mint, brown sugar and limes.  I, unfortunately, was stricken with a headache after all the day's sun exposure, so I couldn't drink.  I had Coke, with lime since the waitress thought I needed to dress it up.  Dinner was quesadillas.  Doesn't sound like much, but I'm not a fan of any cheese except the fake ones, Velveeta and Cheez Whiz, and mozzarella.  So voluntarily having a meal that's mostly pepper jack (I think) was a step in the right direction.  They had chicken in them and were served with a fresh pico de gallo.  A bit more reading, and to bed fairly early - around midnight.  South Beach tomorrow!

       Via  urlLink Jenica ,  urlLink The Friday Five , from April 25, 2003:   1. What was the last TV show you watched?    urlLink That 70s Show , syndicated, last night at 10:30   2. What was the last thing you complained about?  Not more than a minute ago, I was talking with Statia about a coworker who can't deal with change.  She likes things "the way they've always been."   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?   Lora, I guess - I said that she's not frustrating.  It doesn't sound like much, but she knows what I mean.     4. What was the last thing you threw away?   Scraps of VistaFoil - I'm processing paperbacks today.  No, wait - cruddy baby carrot ends from my lunch.   5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?   Comcast.net - I was checking my email.

        urlLink Lora's blog  is sucking my brain out of my head.   1: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  A box of sheet protectors on an industrial metal wall shelf.  Or maybe a box of transparencies.  I'm nearsighted, remember?   2: What is the last thing you watched on TV?  Cubs 12, Pirates 1   3: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is.  4:45   4: Now look at the clock; what is the actual time?  4:54 - woohoo!   5: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?  Server whirring.  Mini-fridge cycling.  Random office noise, but from far away.   6: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?  8:54; arriving at work.   7: Did you dream last night?   Yes.   8: When did you last laugh?   Really hard - last night, when I read that Jenica's eating cat food 'cause she's lazy.  Sorta hard, this morning while discussing sleekness issues online with a very helpful but still somehow frustrating person.   9: What is on the walls of the room you are in?  Ye gods, a list?  Fine, from the point of the transparencies box, then, clockwise: a) note taped to wall that reads: "Dear Sirs, Please accept these books as a donation - they shouldn't just be thrown away." (posted next to donation shelf) b) mug rack c) bulletin board covered with postcards + 1 tracing of rabid squirrel d) projected cast of the Stephanie Plum movie e) Professor Frink in an apple ("Frink Different") f) behind computer consultant's desk, 2 very old red Valentine hearts made of construction paper.  1 reads: "Cutie"; the other: "U R A OK".  Erm, perhaps they should be removed? g) one of two signs (one each for 2 doors) that reads: "Technical Services: Please Use Other Door", for use in emergencies (generally of a mental and/or musical nature). h) coworker T's bulletin board, covered with Cubs memorabilia and photos of her children i) calendars j) my bulletin board, containing: 1 pair miniature pink furry underpants; sign reading "When someone annoys you, remember this: it takes 42 muscles to  frown, but it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and whack them in the head."; 5 comic strips; 4 newspaper photos of athletes; 1 business card; 1 red ribbon ("2nd Place!"); 1 marker-colored cow; several hand-written quotations; and a postcard featuring four photographs of sumo wrestlers which was saved from destruction when the book it had been marking was withdrawn.   13: Seen anything weird lately?   Other than my office?  Yes, in the Amazon.com reader reviews for the new Bob Woodward book  urlLink Plan of Attack , there's one by a reader "named" Dipper Lips.  Here it is, in its entirety: "I Dipper sleepy.  Book me tired.  Flying monkeys give me itchies.  Fly monkey fly."     14: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?   A time machine.   15: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?   That's too much power for an impulsive person to have.  Today, I'd probably eliminate suffering - but only for people I like.   16: Do you like to dance?   Yes.  That does not equate to "can you dance?"   17: George Bush   Do I have to?  I'd really rather not.   18: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?   Sam.   But I'm not going to have a child.    19: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?   Nat.   But I'm not going to have a child.    22: Would you ever consider living abroad?   Yes.  Since I'm such a poor traveler, though, I'd better choose well the first time - I wouldn't want to have to come back.  I'd imagine I'll eventually have to choose a place that doesn't have an extradition treaty anyway.

       We had severe weather in Illinois on Tuesday.  Tornadoes.  Although I'd known that something happened, I hadn't realized that it was so catastrophic.  Eight people are dead, killed in a small town called Utica that's about 60 miles south of here.  Several others were trapped but have been rescued.  What has me totally shaken up about this is that John, the computer consultant who's in our office once a week, is a storm-chaser.  Although I know that he was here pretty late on Tuesday (because I was, too), I don't know if he was out chasing that storm after he left.  Considering how bad it was - wind speeds topping out around 220 mph, and at least 8 people  dead  - the thought that he could have been there chilled me.    I guess I don't realize how much he'd come to be a part of what I consider my real life until it was - or seemed to be - threatened.  I'm still learning to not be so short-sighted.

       It's taken a bit longer than I'd planned to get in the mode to write this.  I think that's because the vacation was a whole lot different than I'd imagined it would be.  But I don't want to get ahead of myself.  This is going to go blow-by-blow.  Bear with me.   Wednesday, 14 April 2004  Hadn't finished packing the night before.  Woke up with my hands already shaking, not quite freaked out about the plane trip but certainly not looking forward to it.  Wandered around the house in a daze, throwing things into luggage and my trusty, beaten-to-hell by law school  urlLink bag  mostly haphazardly.  Couldn't decide between sweaters and short-sleeved shirts, so I packed the sweaters.  To Miami?!    Left to pick up Tara a bit after noon.  Drove to O'Hare.  On the way (on IL-47, if you must know, near Huntley, just south of I-90, across from the pumpkin silo), we saw something very strange.  There were 4 elderly men sitting by the side of the road.  They were pretty close to some vehicles, so they hadn't just been abandoned there, but it was still weird.  They just seemed to be watching the traffic go by.  Whatever!  In all, it was not a bad trip - made it in around an hour and a half, which is remarkable for midday, mid-week.  Parked in long-term lot G, which is practically in Missouri it's so far from the airport.  (The other lots were full.)  Had a moment of panic when the first guy in the bus from the parking lot to the tram was wearing a Baxter Plasma Products polo shirt.  Too coincidental.  And there was a guy on the tram who looked an awful lot like I'd imagine Rob must look now, although it has been 12 years since I've seen him and this guy had a large ring on.  Even considering significant changes in lifestyle, I can't imagine him wearing a large, almost signet-like ring.  Anyway, after riding in the car, the bus, and the tram, the airport was a haven of non-movement.  Lunch at a sports pub, where I tried not to watch the Cubs game but couldn't help but glance out of the corner of my eye as they creamed the Pirates 8-3.  Shared a French Dip and fries with Tara.  As we slowly wandered back toward the gate, we noticed that there were a bunch of people in line.  Hmm.  What are they lined  up for?  Oh, shit - the plane!  We weren't late.  It was just then, at that very moment, time for us to board.  I can't believe how close we came to  missing  the flight, though!  Crazy.  And no time to hit the head before we left, so we used the on-board.  Yuck: a reminder why I don't do that very often.  I wondered while I was in there if they make them so small, in part, to discourage people from attempting the 'mile high club' rumors that we've all heard but no one I actually know has every really acted out?  The smell alone (antiseptic and a weird sort of metal) would discourage any sane person, I think.  Tara read about an interesting website in a magazine during the flight.   urlLink www.honku.org  - The Zen Antidote to Road Rage.  Haiku about road rage!  Whacko.  After a relatively nondescript flight lasting about 3 hours, we landed in Miami.   Fucking gorgeous.   The airport's in a crap neighborhood, from what I could see, and it was still amazingly beautiful.  We got there around 7:45 PM local time and the sky was sort of dusky and hazy, and it was 75°.  We got our luggage, grabbed a cab, and took the 10 or so minute ride to the hotel.  ($20 for the ride, plus tip - seemed pretty pricey.)  The hotel - really nice.  Check out  urlLink their website  if you're so inclined, particularly the Virtual Tour.  Our room was exactly like the double shown.  The problem: it was on the 21st floor.  Have I mentioned that I've got a serious problem with heights?  It had a balcony.  The doors opened!  There were chairs -  outside!   21 floors  up !  Nauseating.  Had dinner in the hotel's Riverwalk Cafe.  A chicken Caesar salad the size of my head, sloppily overdressed.  A coke in which a small child could have swum.  To sleep fairly early (11:00?) - no plans for Thursday, but we didn't want to sleep the day away.  So, no truly new experiences on Wednesday, other than being in Miami for the first time.  Although we did see a Jai Alai venue from the taxi on the way to the hotel - that was something I'd never experienced before.  Does that count?  More to come!

       "Poets die young -- younger than novelists, playwrights and other writers, a U.S. researcher said on Wednesday.   "It could be because poets are tortured and prone to self-destruction, or it could be that poets become famous young, so their early deaths are noticed, said James Kaufman of the Learning Research Institute at California State University at San Bernardino."  For more information, read  urlLink the article  on Yahoo!  “For a man to become a poet he must be in love, or miserable.”  Lord Byron  “Poetry is the journal of a sea animal living on land, wanting to fly in the air.”  Carl Sandburg  “Poetry is the eloquence of truth.”  (unknown)  “Painting is silent poetry, and poetry painting that speaks.”  Plutarch  “Poetry: where I encounter what is not in memory but arises through a kind of instinct, deep-running, inventive.  Recognition of something I don't know I knew; something I know only as I write and a poem begins to deliver itself, to assert a reality, startling but oddly familiar.”  Martha Cooley, in  The Archivist   “We make out of the quarrel with others, rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry.”  William Butler Yeats  “Poetry is the synthesis of hyacinths and biscuits.”  Carl Sandburg  “Romance and poetry, ivy, lichens and wallflowers need ruin to make them grow.”  Nathaniel Hawthorne, in the preface to  The Marble Fawn   “…much of poetry is really about letting yourself know what you know, about making intuitive connections.”  Alisa Kwitney, in  Does She or Doesn’t She?

       From  urlLink Lora :   First, as a warm up, using the letters I-N-S-A-N-E reveal six things about yourself:  I -  Indulgent  N -  Nearsighted  (borrowed from Lora via Robert) S -  Sarcastic  A -  Animalistic  (take that as you wish) N -  Nitpicky  E -  Eternally undecided    1. What's the best pickup line you ever heard and did it work?  I've never taken part in the scene in which pickup lines are appropriate.  Significant conversation has always been a typical precursor.  Well, that or lots of beer and a significant look.  2. If you were a character in  The Wizard of Oz , who or what would you be?  Which one didn't have a brain?  3. If you were an element of weather, what would you be?   I'd be a tornado.  There's nothing more appealing than being chased....  (Lora, keep your mouth  closed , please.)  And I'm very untidy.  4. If you were a breed of dog, what would you be and why?  This is a very difficult question to answer, because I've had a serious dog phobia since I was little.  I guess I could handle being a dachshund or a beagle, though.  Probably a beagle, because they're absolutely impossible to resist, and I think they're particularly loyal and relatively good-natured.  5. If you were a toy or a game, what would you be and why?  Dice. No comment.  [insert sweet but mysterious smile here]

       A friend, who is rapidly becoming a good friend, recently asked about my favorite books.  What follows is a list of some that I would rank among the best I've ever read, along with reasons, if I can give them.  No links 'cause it would take forever and a day.  ^  Almost a Gentleman  by Pam Rosenthal - not to every taste, this is an exquisitely rendered account of a fantastic method of dealing with very real pain. ~  Avoidance  by Michael Lowenthal - ah, God, lovely and so sad.  Lots like Alexander Chee's  Edinburgh , but really exponentially more beautiful.  (But Chee's book is quite good, too.) ^  The Brothers K  by David James Duncan - I sometimes think that the subtle goal of my life is to influence everyone I care about to read this book.  It says as much about me as it does about its acknowledged subjects (baseball, religion, fishing, family, Vietnam). ~  Cardiofitness  by Alessandra Montrucchio - the only popular Italian fiction I've read, but if this is the standard of quality, I shouldn't read anything else.  Mesmerizing. ^  Cry No More  by Linda Howard - although I generally like what she's written, I thought this was really fantastic. ~  Cupid & Diana  by Christina Bartolomeo - emotional but smart ^  Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant  by Anne Tyler - the book that made me a fan ~  Faking It  by Jennifer Crusie - just damned funny ^  Good-Bye to All That  by Robert Graves - the finest memoir ever written.  Perhaps the finest nonfiction work ever written. ~  Housewrights  by Art Corriveau - a study in understatement, triangularity, and the challenges of proper behavior ^  Hunter’s Moon  by Karen Robards - this comes pretty close to "trashy novel", but it's damned good, too.   ~  The Inn at Lake Devine  by Elinor Lipman - charming and funny, but deeply meaningful and heartfelt.  A very close second to  The Brothers K  for primary space in my heart. ^  The Last Chance Saloon  by Marian Keyes - a book that I want to force my friends to read, so they can understand my pain and confusion, but also what their friendship means. ~  The Long Gray Line  by Rick Atkinson - one of the best books about the Vietnam era, and about individual soldiers, and about West Point. ^  A Married Man  by Catherine Alliott - yes, it looks like de rigeur Brit chick lit (the cover is a very fashionable woman sitting in an oversized spoon - yargh!), but it's much deeper than that.  Reminiscent of  The Dominant Blonde  by Alisa Kwitney - looks can be deceiving. ~  Martin Sloane  by Michael Redhill - I'm not sure that this is a "10".  It might be a "3".  But it was definitely worth reading, if only to decide whether you love it or hate it.   ^  Nice  by Jen Sacks - God, I wish I'd written this book! ~  Night Magic  by Karen Robards - a spy novel with twists that's funny and hot. ^  A Passion for Books: A Book Lover’s Treasury of Stories, Essays, Humor, Lore, and Lists on Collecting, Reading, Borrowing, Lending, Caring For, and Appreciating Books , edited by Harold Rabinowitz & Rob Kaplan - reading this made me want to quit my job, find a crappy apt. on the Mississippi, and devote myself to writing.  Which is what I truly intend to do...when I grow up. ~  Picturing Will  by Ann Beattie - not a "happy" book, or comfortable, but it gets under your skin. ^  The Reader  by Bernhard Schlink - I read it before it was an Oprah book, and I liked it anyway. ~  The River Why  by David James Duncan - hmm.  Duncan, river.  I sense a theme in my life. ^  A Room of One’s Own  by Virginia Woolf - when I read this in college (for my History of Modern England class), I hated it.  I, an overconfident and thoughtless child, resented this old crazy lady telling me what it meant to be a real, adult, independent woman.  Over time, however, I came to realize that I hadn't had a clue, and that there was more to being an adult than getting away with things - than having one's parents not find out when one made poor decisions.  And £500 a month and a room of my own (or what that represents) means more and more to me as time goes forward. ~  Silence in October  by Jens Christian Grøndahl - the most difficult, complex, and philosophical thing I've ever read.  It took about 6 months for me to get through it.  I loved it, but it scared me.  And as soon as I finished it, I wanted to start it over, knowing what I then knew. ^  Spin Cycle  by Sue Margolis - light and funny. ~  The Story of Jane  by Catherine Cusset - unforgettable.  Reinforcement of the importance of writing in my life. ^  Time After Time  by Sue Haasler - perfectly encapsulates what it means to have lived in the late 80s - and to now miss it, at least a little. ~  The Writer’s Life: Intimate Thoughts on Work, Love, Inspiration and Fame from the Diaries of the World’s Great Writers , edited by Carol Edgarian & Tom Jenks - a lot like  A Passion for Books , this makes me want to weep for the writer I could have been.  So, there you have it.  What do y'all like?

       Full moon today, or what?!  People are fucking  nuts .  I've closed my office door - a rarity - to keep out the crazies.  And to keep in the noise.  Today it's the  Weeshy-Washy Hodge-Podge Mellow-Mush Mix , a compilation of Wolfy mixes.  In case you're curious, here's the playlist:  1. "Love Song for a Savior" - Jars of Clay (notable because I'm  not  a fan of the Christian rock thang, but good 'ole Wolfos didn't realize this was of that genre until I pointed it out to him.  At which time he was absolutely  horrified  to have included it on so many mixes.  tee hee.  Makes me giggle every time I hear it, which probably isn't the point.) 2. "More than Words" - Extreme 3. "One" - U2 live with REM (queerer than I'd anticipated before I heard it for the first time.  I thought it would be kismet, but it's a little creepy.) 4. "I'm on the Outside" - Staind with Fred Durst (what can I say?  Utterly depressed and depressing.) 5. "Island in the Sun" - Weezer ( so  late-80s/Green Day/boppy) 6. "My Own Worst Enemy" - Lit 7. "Hash Pipe" - Weezer 8. "We Are" - Vertical Horizon 9. "Tonight, Tonight" - Smashing Pumpkins (I'm not a fan of their stuff, generally, but this one's good) 10. "Blue Sky Mine" - Midnight Oil ('Cause we love and support all things Australian) 11. "Wishing Well" - Terence Trent D'Arby 12. "Galileo" - Indigo Girls (Can't hear this without wanting to just  HOWL .  There's something pure and elemental about it, and I'm one of those whackos who shaves her legs.) 13. "Here Is Gone" - Goo Goo Dolls ( Love  this.  Why?  Reminds me of the Thicke boys, Brian and Troy - yargh.  If anyone from Winona's reading this, I'll pay for that little comment, I'm sure.) 14. "Still Fighting It" - Ben Folds (sigh - makes me question some things that I'm fairly sure I'm sure about.  "...everything changed") 15. "Hot Thing" - Prince (memories...  And by the way, did anyone see his induction to the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame?  The version that he, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and George Harrison's son Daniel did of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" -  wow .  Virtuosity.) 16. "Black Balloon" - Goo Goo Dolls 17. "To Be With You" - Mr. Big 18. "Boy in the Box" - Corey Hart (this isn't a Wolfy song, but rather a Jenica song, tracked down and added at her request.  Not that I don't love it anyway.  'Cause I do.)  Today's main annoyance: I didn't even get to my desk before I was bombarded with questions and comments.  And it wasn't the expected "how was your trip" sorts of stuff - although that would've been sort of meaningless, too.  Rather, it was the usual work garbage, and it could've waited 2 minutes so I'd have had time to plunk my bag down, make tea, and check the pile of crap on my desk for new crap.  But no, I was forced to stand in the circ office, not yet truly awake, and feign curiosity and alertness in regards to a bunch of tedious stuff about which I don't care.  In so doing, I was pushed to agree to accompany the director to a meeting with an attorney later this week regarding the law library.  Upon further contemplation (i.e. after I had a chance to wake up and consider the situation), I realized that I'd been bamboozled, again.  I'd intended to, somehow, delicately, broach the subject this week of removing myself from the law library project  entirely .  Now I am, for all intents and purposes, locked into getting the whole fucking thing done by May 17.  How is that humanly possible?  I was also slipped some delicate, useful information from a strange source; co-worker T discovered (by reading the Library Board of Trustees meeting minutes {something I can never be troubled to do, since they're not easy to track down}) that the director has implied (or something stronger than "implied") that I will train the staff to use Westlaw.  That has never been asked of me.  The subject hasn't even been broached.  I haven't used the product since 1999.  I'm not qualified to train anyone!  Fuck, I'm not even qualified to  use  it,  myself !  She's creeping closer and closer to  using  me - in my role as an attorney - for her own gain (or for the library's gain, which is splitting hairs because it's not for my gain, and they're not providing recompense for my legal training).  It's all, all, all, all Bullshit.  And I haven't calmed down enough to get the Board minutes, much less to talk with her about it.  Guess I'll have to do that before Thursday, though.  I'll start writing about the trip this evening.

       Quick 'n Dirty:  1. Sunburned.  So very sunburned. 2. In a mental fog - so much alcohol, so much time for contemplation, so much sand and beach and ocean, so much flirting. 3. Couldn't hate the flight experience more than I do right now. 4. El Mojito does bad things to some people, funny things to others. 5. Bongos, one of the Estefan family's restaurants in downtown (seaside) Miami, is incredibly fun and has wonderful food, but unbelievably pathetic music. 6. 1 in 10 taxi drivers in Miami is hotter than hell, and just as dangerous. 7. For an expensive hotel, the Hyatt Regency Miami doesn't quite have the "at least 1 washcloth and drinking glass per person" thing down. 8.  Couldn't care less about work. 9.  It's hard to gain interesting experiences when one rarely leaves the hotel. 10. The Wolfsonian = peculiar.

       I'm starting to get nervous.  Have I mentioned that I hate to fly?  "Hate" is a strong word.  "Am terrified to" would be a more accurate way to put it.  My hands are already shaking, and I'm still more than 2 hours from leaving for the airport!  It's not so bad once I'm there - it's like being on a conveyor belt: get to O'Hare, park, take the train to the airport itself, check in, stand in line, shlep luggage all over, stand in line, stand in line, wait, decide whether to buy one more book and an outlandishly-priced bottle of water for the plane, stand in line, stand in a metal tube (claustrophobia, anyone?), get into the plane itself (enhanced claustrophobia, anyone?), find seat (middle of 3-seat side, 19 rows back), get in and turn on the blower full-blast and buckle up right away, and immediately fall asleep.  It's like some kind of airplane-induced narcolepsy, although it's not "real sleep" because I'm basically aware of what's going on.  But I guess I snore a little.  (How charming.)  I don't mind take-off, and that sense that your internal organs would be 2 rows back if it weren't for the seat cover.  But the ride...turbulence...the view from the plane...yuck.  I'm better off asleep.  I crack my eye when the chick comes around offering beverages, and get some juice.  Then there's landing, when I could just weep with fear.  Well, I could do that the whole time, really.  I keep thinking, "We're heavier than air.  This cannot happen.  We're going to die.  These people are stupid to not realize it."  It's a litany of logic (and paranoia, I know).  So we land, and then there's the million-year wait for the doors to open before I can get the hell out of that metal tube, and into the larger metal tube.  And then walk, and then wait, and then get the luggage, and then walk some more.  But then...different!  Find a  taxi!   Take the taxi to the  hotel!   Find some  dinner!   And by that point, it shall be  vacation!   But at this point, I'm still just scared.  I'm also trying to shake off the effects of being really pissed off too early this morning.  I was reading a friend's blog, and someone else was dogging her using her Comments function.  A number of people sprang to her, I was going to say "rescue" or "defense" but that's not the right way to put it - the point is that she hadn't done anything inappropriate in the first place, was unfairly targeted, and didn't do anything *remotely* deserving of the attitude that she'd gotten.  So I'd think it must've been at least marginally reassuring to have seen the way her acknowledged friends were vocal in support.  But it's peculiar and disconcerting that someone - particularly someone hiding behind the veil of "anonymous" comments" - would bother to be so condescending and mean to another person, on that person's blog.  So I kind of snapped.  My response to the situation wasn't as all-purpose supportive as some other peoples', but more of a counter-attack to the cretin who chose to go after her in the first place (in the guise of doing the right thing, of all pathetic maneuvers).  I don't regret having responded, but I do wish I'd waited until I was a bit more awake, because I might've handled it in a less inflammatory way.  That's a sort of vague goal of mine, anyway: to think before I act.  Sometimes things just mean too much to wait on, though.  This isn't how I wanted to leave the blog in my absence, but there's not much time now.  I've got to shower, pack my last-minute stuff, and get to Tara's by 12:15.  That includes getting to the Library to drop off some work that I did last night.  (3 review journals - am I a dedicated employee, or what?  That would be "or what", contestants, since I've been lugging those same journals with me for about 2 weeks.  My excuse: our subscription to  Publishers Weekly  was supposed to have ended in February, so those are "extras" and so their dates shouldn't really "count", right?  Yeah, I thought so.)  Eh, that's more than 2 hours.  No problem!    When next I write, I'll be tan and full of Cuban-infused stories to share...

       Anticipation is driving me insane.  How can I break this down for you?  Hmm.  Let me put it this way:  I do not want to be here anymore.   I want to be in Miami, right now.  Work is boring.  I want to be in the sun, where it's warm, and where no one wants anything from me that involves books or goddamned OCLC records.  I feel like it's all I can do just to focus my eyes on the poor wretch who's making the mistake of talking to me; I'm snapping peoples' heads off for asking simple questions.  Yargh.  I shouldn't have planned to work today, but I'd be a mess at home, pacing and wandering and wishing for tomorrow.  I'm eating lunch at my desk.  There's just a ton for me to get done before I go, so it would be even more ridiculous than usual for me to pretend that I need a fucking hour to eat a PB&J and some carrots.  The director seems to be holding a committee meeting (of the Board of Trustees) in her office, which is across a little 6' foyer from my office.  I closed my door so they wouldn't hear my music.  This morning we listened to my  Hodge-Podge  mix from Wolfgang.  Mostly reasonable stuff from the late '90s and early '00s, but a bit of it isn't really for public consumption.  "My Own Worst Enemy" by Lit, for instance:   Can we forget about the things I said When I was drunk I didn't mean to call you that I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me Please tell me, please tell me Why My car is in the front yard, And I'm Sleeping with my clothes on Came in through the window last night And you're gone Gone It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy 'Cause every now and then I kick the living shit out of me The smoke alarm is going off, And there's a cigarette Still burning, Please tell me why my car is in the front yard And I'm sleeping with my clothes on Came in through the window last night and you're gone Gone please tell me why my car is in the front yard And I'm sleeping with my clothes on I came in through the window last night It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy 'Cause every now and then I kick the living shit out of me Can we forget about the things I said When I was drunk I didn't mean to call you that    It reminds me a lot of my sordid late teens and early 20s, when I'd get home but wasn't sure quite how I'd done it.  Or when I'd do my laundry and pull something out of the dryer that I knew I'd worn, but that I didn't know exactly how I'd acquired.  Sometimes the details would sink in over time (and more often than not I'd prefer that they hadn't), and sometimes others would fill in the blanks.  Even now a lot of it is a mystery.  I guess I'm an object lesson in the power of redemption.  Another song in the mix that we managerial types probably shouldn't be crankin' on company time: "Hash Pipe" by Weezer.    Since Worker T left and I'm alone, I put in  Powderfinger & Mix for Amy , also from Wolfgang.  I'm feeling a little sad and lonesome for my Wolfy.  His birthday was last weekend.  I haven't talked to him in ages, probably since our lunch out at Pantera.  This is a great mix: very Australian, very Wolfy, and it takes me back to how I felt when we were really close.  Here's the playlist:  1. My Happiness - Powderfinger 2. The Metre - Powderfinger 3. Trading Places - Powderfinger 4. Passenger - Powderfinger 5. Pick You Up - Powderfinger 6. d.a.f. - Powderfinger 7. Living Type - Powderfinger 8. The Day You Came - Powderfinger 9. Already Gone - Powderfinger 10. My Kind of Scene - Powderfinger 11. True Tears of Joy - Hunters & Collectors 12. Throw Your Arms Around Me - Hunters & Collectors 13. Holy Grail - Hunters & Collectors 14. Blind Eye - Hunters & Collectors 15. When the River Runs Dry - Hunters & Collectors 16. Throw Your Arms Around Me - Pearl Jam 17. Yellow Ledbetter - Pearl Jam  I knew I needed a vacation, but that sense was reinforced yesterday when I was drafting a memo to the staff, reminding them of something that they've been told several times, yet they persist in willfully ignoring.  The [draft] memo includes the phrases "If you do, I'll come after you..." and "...I will kick your idiotic ass."  As tempting as that is, it's probably not the route I want to take if I'm looking for compliance.  Or continued employment.    Speaking of that, I guess I should get back to work.  Boo.

       ~ Half of the circ staff called in sick today.   The circ manager didn't come in today, and no one knows where she might be.  (There seems to be a voicemail message on her phone, but since it's hers, she's the only one with the password.)   The director didn't deign to arrive until 2:30, and as far as I know, didn't let anyone know that beforehand.   How professional!  ~ We've participated in a standing order plan for adult fiction for the last few years.  We picked the authors that we thought were the most popular, and we automatically receive their new hardcover books.  It's a very convenient system, but it's expensive (in the sense of there sometimes being a hell of a lot of items showing up that we didn't intentionally order) and it's a bit confusing to keep in mind who's on the list so we don't order duplicate copies of those titles that are coming via the program.    I did some research last week into how well those authors are actually circulating.  The results were surprising.  The old standbys, like VC Andrews, Michael Crichton, and Andrew M. Greeley, don't circ well at all.  We'll take them off the list and think twice about even ordering their books from now on.  At the same time, some authors surprised me - Barbara Delinsky's books, on average, circulate 15x.  That's good, for us.  Dean R. Koontz goes out reasonably well, too.  I think the biggest surprise was Anne McCaffrey (a science fiction author), who I've always been told is a guaranteed circulator for this library.  Most of her titles have circulated twice since we've been automated (since 9/02).  Not only will we remove her from the list, but we'll also weed her area heavily.  It's amazing how a little research can be so enlightening.  ~ My Hair: The Continuing Saga.  It was dark, short, and razor-cut (for the last week and a half), but as of this morning it's a buttery, sort of tawny brown and much more softened at the ends.  Lori says it'll lighten up more in the Florida sun.    ~ Cookies - didn't make any.  Tara made spritz cookies, which is a skill that has escaped me for my entire life.  I envy her ability, but I also envy her tools - she has a grandma-era aluminum (I'm assuming it's aluminum, anyway?) cookie press, and that can really make all the difference.  Mine's some high-tech Wilton gadget.  Damned cookies.  At least she took pity on my pathetic spritz-poor self and shared some.  They're lovely: light, crisp-but-not-hard, and not overly sweet.  The perfect cookie for a weekend in which I ate too much anyway.  ~ Clothes.  I bought out  urlLink The Territory Ahead .  A  urlLink t-shirt  in Cornflower, 3 pairs of shorts - 2 of the  urlLink "Trompe L'oeil"  in Natural and 1 of the  urlLink "Live and Let Live"  in Overdyed Green, and  finally , a spring jacket:  urlLink "The Raquette Lake Cruiser"  in Cognac.  I'm extremely happy with my purchases.  New clothes for vacation!  ~ I came into work so late today (10:00) that I've got to work until 6:30, damn it, so I should probably do something 'worthwhile' to make the time pass.  One more day until it's departure day!  I cannot wait....

       There was some bloggish intrigue earlier this week.  Some hackitude.  Some sense that all is not right in this little created world.  I took steps to protect it, but they were later revealed to be only illusory changes.  A paradigm shift is in order.  Nothing dramatic, really, just belated acceptance of what I've been told all along - a bit of care along the line will prevent me from sweating and fearing reprisals in the future.    Anyway, thanks to those who offered support, concern, technical advice, or merely asked where the blog text went for a day or so.  It's awfully nice to know that someone is on the other end.  Moving on.  Miami.   Mmmm.   Departure in 4 days, 1 hour and 50 minutes, give or take.  In contemplating how the too-short days there will be spent, I've decided only one formal thing: I will undertake to try Something New at least once per day, and at least ten times overall, while on this trip.  I've become sedate and stuck in my ways, and I want to e-x-p-a-n-d, mentally and culturally.  The main inspiration for this has been discussions with a particular friend who bemoans my tiny, pedestrian palate.  I told him I'd try a new food each day when I went to Santa Fe, NM, last year.  He wasn't at all impressed when, of the new things I'd tried, the one that I liked the best was Sun Chips.  Well, I'd never had them before, so they were new to me, and I didn't realize that one can get them at any grocery store anyplace in the country!  So I've grasped that the food idea is too narrow, and there's too great a probability for failure there.  I want to return from my vacation with good stories, not a sense that I've let anyone else (or myself!) down.  So I'll do something new, something "that I wouldn't have done before", at least once a day, and I'll try to come back with ten stories of new things to share.  This isn't going to be a safe little trip of shopping malls and major museums.  Tara has already asserted that we're going to put the concierge to work, making arrangements for us.  With any luck, that'll result in a vicarious trip to Florida for anyone who wants to take one.

       From November 23, 2001:   1. What was the last book you read? Did you enjoy it?    Late Bloomer , by Melissa Pritchard.  At the time that I read it, I was squirmy with discomfort and didn't think I was going to like it.  When I finished, I thought I'd liked it in spite of myself.  In the intervening time, I've been unable to get it out of my head; I forced it on my friend Debbie, and dragged Tara around Barnes & Noble looking for it.  I'm not often affected by books in this way, because I read so much and so quickly.  I don't think I'll forget this one.   2. What's your favorite book of all time?   The Brothers K , by David James Duncan.  There's never been a book - or even a  thing  in my life - that I've loved so much as I loved this book.  I laughed out loud, and cried  hard , and read the last few chapters as slowly as I could manage so that it wouldn't have to end, and cried even harder when it was over, because it was over.  Since then, I've given it to anyone I can think of who I care about, who cares about books in the way that I do.    [Incidentally, it's also the prime example of the adage that you can't judge a book by its cover; my only reason for buying the book was the jacket illustration - a bird in a post, and a baseball.  Why did I like that?  Who knows.  But I'm glad I did.]   3. What's the worst book you've ever read?   There are entirely too many nominees for this category, but I'll give a top-3 list: A. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas by James Patterson (it's like breathing maple syrup) B. Theory of Relativity by Jacqueline Mitchard (a "suspense" novel so full of red herrings and triteness that I gag even now to think that I wasted so much time reading it) C. An Independent Wife by Linda Howard (promotes degradation of women; I would personally burn every copy of this book if I could.  If I were the author, I'd buy all copies I could find online and shred them.)   4. What book that you've read would you most like to see adapted into a movie?    The Man Who Wrote the Book , by Erik Tarloff.  It would be fucking hilarious.  The book made me roar, but in a way that was more like a movie playing in my head than most books are.   Genius.    5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?  Doing laundry, pre-packing, making lists - generally, preparing to leave ON WEDNESDAY (hurray!) for Miami.  Also, if she can, making Easter roll-out cookies with Tara on Saturday.

       I'm thinking today about life changes.  How sometimes you plan them - seek them out and strongly desire them - and sometimes they fall in your lap and it's up to you to deal with them on the fly.  I've spent a lot of time whining and worrying about my job change over the last few weeks, but it's really not all that bad, and it's time for me to shut up about it.  I can make some changes so that it's not such a drastic difference from "The Way Things Were", if that's what I want, but I can also change the way I perceive it.  So I'm going to set out to do that.  John's here today.  It's obvious, and becoming more so by the minute, that he doesn't know that I exist.  Have I mentioned that he's tall?  Well, I didn't realize just how tall until a moment ago, when I was coming into Tech Services and he was  flying  out, into the foyer in front of the administrative offices, heading toward the circulation office.  For one thing, I crept up on him and startled him, so he jumped and sort of "eep"ed when he saw me.  But more significantly, I might come up to his elbow.  The man is   tall  .  I don't know if Minnesotan men are abnormally short, but I don't think I've regularly spent time with anyone who's this tall.  I'm fascinated!  But he seriously doesn't seem to notice that I'm in the room anymore... unless he's about to walk on me.  I wish I could just shut it off, but now I'm too interested in what he's doing.  And he just keeps running back and forth between TS and the circ office like there's a fire - or like he  really  doesn't want to be back here.  Sigh.  Tara has an interview today at a large library east of here.  The job sounds like a good one - an interesting position that would use a variety of her skills, education and experience.  A real challenge.  Unfortunately, the posting wasn't very specific, and the HR person with whom she spoke on the telephone wasn't terribly helpful, so she's going into the interview feeling at a disadvantage.  It reminded me of some job-hunting experiences I've had...  * age 16, applied to be part-time dishwasher at Happy Chef Restaurant.  Didn't get an interview.  * age 16, applied for posted position in bakery at grocery store.  Interview involved bakery manager and 2 store owners and lasted 1 hour.  Received job - my first - at $3.85/hr.  * age 18, applied for work-study position in Audio-Visual dept. at WSU.  Initially hired to staff computer lab, eventually (i.e. after a month or less) migrated into the office, where I was the right-hand guy for the office manager for 4 1/2 years.  Because of a change in the financial aid requirements, I lost my work-study grant, but they hired me back directly as "student help" and kept me on through vacations and summers, and even after I graduated.  One of the best jobs, working conditions, learning experiences, and supervisors I could have ever asked for.  I was very, very lucky to find it.  * age 19, after [violently] quitting the bakery after having my hours cut from 60 [posted!] one week to 6 [!] the next, applied for "veggie prep" job at pizza parlor.  Job hours: 11 pm-2 am.  Conditions: sucky.  Uniform: cream t-shirt, size small ("it's the only size we can get - sorry").  I accepted the position because I had to make my rent, but...  * age 19, at the same time I'd applied for the pizza job, applied for night cook at ice cream parlor/burger joint.  Pay was the same, but hours were better and there was no sexist uniform.  So I never called the crappy pizza place back to tell them I wasn't coming - I just didn't show up.  The interview at the restaurant was a joke.  "Can you cook?"  "No."  "Knife skills?"  "No."  And so on.  But I was a history major, and the owner had a history degree, so he hired me.  (Is it any wonder they're out of business?)  He turned me into a damned good cook, or, more likely, I became one by watching him and in spite of his best efforts to teach me.  * age 22, just moved to Ann Arbor, desperate for something to do, picked up a Michigan Daily (the student newspaper).  Classified ad: "office help.  Call ###-####."  So I called, and I talked to this totally incomprehensible person with a very heavy urban accent.  All I picked up was "337 East Liberty", so I dressed up the next day and walked there to fill out an application.  Cream blouse, shortshortshort black-watch plaid cheerleader skirt, black strappy slipper flats (and probably huge Julia Roberts  Pretty Woman  hair).  A very handsome young man (my age?  maybe a year or two older?) in cowboy boots retrieved an application form for me and told me he was impressed that I brought my own pen.  I looked at him like he was a little dim and said, "It would look pretty lame to a potential employer if I didn't."  He laughed and said, "I'm the manager, you know."  I turned a dozen shades of red and figured any hope of the job was lost.  Actually, I found out later that that comment (and the pen) were what got me the job.  I stayed there for about 3 years and was happy in the job (which began as enrollment counselor and ended as office manager of that Kaplan Educational Center).   * age 24 - planning to leave Kaplan (after Andy, my first boss had been canned), I was applying for *anything*.  Including (shockingly) youth education secretary at a local church.  The interview: me, at the end of a long conference table, with 3 people on each side.  Pastors and laypeople.  Questions like, "Give the first 3 words that you think of when I say 'teen'!"  My answer: "Jaded, annoyed, scared."  What?!  Should I be working with teenagers?  No!  They apparently decided I was less frightening than my competition, God forbid, because they offered me the job.  Luckily, I'd regained my sense and turned them down, claiming (correctly) that it didn't pay well enough for me.  They counter-offered!  They increased the original offer by about 30%!  Outrageous.  I managed to get out without taking the job, but it was damned close.  * age 27 - second year of law school, needed a GA position that had a stipend.  (Short background to this: the law school encourages students to  not work  during law school,  at all .  Apparently so we'd spend all our time studying.  But how coming into a career with mountains of debt is better than having your school pay for it is beyond me.  In addition, the law school provides grad assistantships, but they don't pay a stipend - they only cover tuition.  And they don't reveal that other GA-ships at the university do have stipends, so when students find that out they're often really pissed.)  I had a law school GA-ship my first year and then was applying for external ones - assistantships in departments and colleges at NIU but outside the law school.  I had interviews all over the place and they were all at crazy times and often during exams, but there was no way around that.  I tried to be as accommodating as possible.  One was with a minority student assistance program.  The coordinator was difficult to contact.  We played phone tag for weeks.  I finally got the interview, arrived for it (4th floor of a building with no elevator, in the spring on a hot day, so I was sweating and uncomfortable but trying to make the best of it), and  she  wasn't there.  No message, either.  She'd had a car accident.  So we rescheduled.  I went to the second interview.  Also too hot.  She didn't show up.  No message.  She'd forgotten!  Third interview.  She was there.  She was rude and abrupt, and treated me as if I'd already agreed to take the job - which involved nothing more than driving underprivileged children from DeKalb to Naperville and Rockford for day trips.  In a van.  A [not even] glorified taxi driver!  I couldn't say 'no' fast enough.  * same time, applied for a GA gig with a nursing prof.  Interview scheduled at 8:00 in the morning.  Brutal time of day for me to get there, but I did it.  And when I arrived, I was told by her bitch of a secretary, "You're a day early, honey.  The appointment's tomorrow."  The fuck it was!  I'm enough of a night person to be extra, super, extremely careful about stuff like this.  There is no possible way that  I  could have gotten that confused -  she  did.  I could've screamed.  Instead, I was about 2 1/2 hours early for class and I had to do it all again the next day!  And, to cap it off, I lost out to one of my classmates who just happened to have an MD.   Prick.   Just 'cause she wanted a research assistant....  * same time, applied for a GA position with the University's Career Planning and Placement office.  A cushy job, really - paper-pushing.  NO stress whatsoever.  Some copying, a little answering of telephones.  I think it even had a private office.  The interview took place in a very large room with 3 long conference tables pushed together to form a U.   I was at the bottom of the U.  There were 2 others in the room, one at the middle of each side of the U.  I couldn't look at both of them at the same time, so when one asked a question, I had to either focus only on that person or look back and forth like I was at a table-tennis match.  It was very uncomfortable, because I was spending a lot of time trying to determine what they wanted me to do.  It was obviously some kind of psych-out trick.  I remember being asked specifically about "the worst job I ever had, and how I left".  I blew that answer completely, just laying into the management system at the grocery store - I did all the things that 'they' say you shouldn't do at an interview while answering that one question.  The interview lasted about an hour, and when it was over they were sweet as pie; "We'll give you a call soon to let you know where you stand."  I left, walked to my car (which was in the parking lot directly outside the building), and drove home - no more than a half hour from their door to mine.  There was a message on my answering machine when I got home, saying that they appreciated my coming in for an interview, but the job was filled.  Ooops.  At the time, I was mortified.  Looking back on it, they were no more professional that day than I was.  They made every effort to make me uncomfortable, and to obscure their objectives.  Mind-game-playing pseudo-academic bitches.  * same time, I applied for a GA gig with the physical therapy dept.  They called me very late - late enough that I thought they weren't serious.  But I went to the interview, and when I was seated in the dept. chair's office she said, "Your grades are good, and your application is fine.  Do you want the job?"  "Yes."  "You have it."    * Finally, I've always wanted to work in a library.  I love books and reading and people who love books and reading.  People who want to learn - voluntarily - are like me.  So when a job was posted at Sycamore Public Library (and I lived 8 blocks away) I applied.  I wasn't called.  Several months later, another job was posted.  I applied.  I interviewed.  I wasn't called back.  Several months later, another job was posted.  Although I thought I was losing my self-esteem and my mind, I applied.  I interviewed.  Finally, I was hired, although the director at that time told me that she wasn't sure that the library world was "right for me".  She was a cataloger, too.  It wasn't more than 6 months later before the president of the Board of Trustees came in, handed her an empty box and said, "You have 30 minutes to gather your things.  You're fired."  I'm still here.

       From November 16, 2001 (still no new ones this week):   1. Name five things in your refrigerator.   A rapidly-dying loaf of English Toasting Bread, 3 rolls of film, skim milk, Coke, and a dozen kinds of beer.   2. Name five things in your freezer.   Absolut vodka, ice cubes, chicken breasts, raspberry daquiri mix, and baby peas.   3. Name five things under your kitchen sink.   Dishwasher detergent, aluminum foil, paper bags, sponges, and softsoap.   4. Name five things around your computer.   Stuffed mice (i.e. stuffed animal mice, not taxidermy), Crate & Barrel catalog, CDs to burn and CD jackets/inserts to make, 5 boxes of index cards from my thesis (sooooooon to be recycled!), and the CD-ROM of The Sims that I've never installed on this computer because I think I'd screw around with it until I got absolutely nothing done.   5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?   Today: another nap, some reading if I feel like it, and early to bed.  Tomorrow, more of the same, although I should probably work a bit.  I'll at least go in long enough to pick up journals.  Sunday: St. Getavia with Tara and maybe Lori if she's free.  Trader Joe's, Cost Plus, Victoria's Secret.  Tea afterward.  Girls' night.  Co-worker X is on vacation all next week so I'll have the office to myself, so it'll be a long but productive week at the salt mine.  A quietish weekend will help prepare for that.

       If you're in a place where you can have the sound on without disturbing anyone else, follow this link and be entertained:   urlLink Soy sauce .  It is perhaps the strangest site I've found online in all my years of poking around in strange websites.  I've been meaning to leave a link to that for ages, but only just remembered this morning.  Nothing better to do since I'm home sick, and sick enough to not even feel like reading.  It's not even one of those "perfect day to stay home" days - the weather is lovely (just 45° but sunny and no wind) and there work situation is very calm today so it would've been a decent day to be there.  But the minor ick from yesterday is full-blown ick today and I didn't want to spread it around.  Home isn't bad, though.  I'm burning CDs now.  Read a magazine that's been sitting around for over a month.  There's an afternoon nap in my future.  The cats are alternating - one wanders in and bugs me while the other one snoozes in the sun.  If I can gather enough energy I might start migrating books from one shelf to another.  (The fiction/literature room needs to be reorganized.  One of the bookcases needs to be emptied so I can co-opt it into the biography/sociology/religion room, if at all possible.)  As has been the case more often than not lately, my thoughts turn north, to two who are working together to help another recover from surgery.  It seems insufficient to say that I hope that recovery is swift and complete.  I wish there was something practical that I could do.  But I'm leery of being in the way, cognizant of my place - aware of what's going on, but maybe more because of peculiar circumstances that because I earned the right to be there.  I know, I've been told to not worry so much, but it's things like this that make me worry the most.  (And only one person in the world's going to know what I meant by that statement - the one who's told me a dozen times in the last few months - "you worry too much!")  Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote, "Men kick friendship around like a football, but it doesn't seem to crack.  Women treat it like glass and it goes to pieces."  I wish I'd never read that, because now I can't get it out of my head and it as much as anything is what concerns me.  But the point of this is not me, it's that there's something greater than one or two - it's the linkages, the friendship that allows people to lean on each other to hold each other up.  The power of connection.  Whether we're in the same room or not, connected hand-in-hand or by email or blog, those voluntary links are what matter.  It's time for a nap.  Good weekend, y'all.

       * The Ick: I think I'm getting it.  I feel like coughing...constantly.  Like there's a little something that needs to come out.  A tiny frog in my throat.  CONSTANTLY!  It's enough to drive me  mad .  And a slight fever?  And chills.  And a headache this morning, something fierce, that just disappeared out of the blue an hour later.    * Law Library: a fucking mess.  It's going to require more work than I can even explain.  So many multiple copies of so many things!  So many missing volumes!  So many titles that repeat information available in other titles!  So much goddamned dust.  So many 5"-wide books that weigh 10 pounds apiece.  How am I supposed to make 1800 out of 2500?!  I don't think that I can!  * Vacation: 13 days away.  I cannot wait to leave.  Museums, beach, galleries, waterfront (the hotel has a water-taxi stand!), shopping, bars, day-trips to the Everglades? or the Keys?, restaurants (real Cuban food!)....  Tara and I were looking at Miami guide books last night at Barnes & Noble.  Plotting our days.  South Beach!  Miami Beach!  The Police Hall of Fame!  It's going to be hard to drag myself onto the plane on Sunday (the 18th) to come back.    * Ikea: unbefuckinglievable.  I think that my relations with Ikea are notorious by now, and I should've known that any attempt to make further purchases would be foolhardy.  But I'm a Minnesotan, so I was hoping for the best.  I placed a large online order.  After going through the entire procedure (a standard multi-step process of choosing items and entering shipping and billing information), I received this message:   "Due to a high volume of orders, we will contact you to confirm your order with the details about your delivery and total cost within 5 - 7 business days."  Say  what ?!  I just agreed to pay more than $30 in shipping for approximately $100 in merchandise, and they won't even contact me for a  week ?!  But what could I do?  I just tried to calm down and chalked it up to experience.  Five days passed.  Seven days passed.  NINE days passed.  And nothing!  So I emailed using an obscure link at the bottom of the final screen that had come up when I ordered, which I'd printed (lucky for me).  I wrote (politely, I thought):   "I placed a web order on 3-13-04.  Nine (9) days have passed since then.  When will it be shipped, and when can I expect it to arrive?"  In return, I received this:  "Hello Amy, Thank you for your recent e-Shop order. Unfortunately, as of 3/13/04 20:54:25 [two] items are out of stock. Since we are unable to complete your order as it was submitted, your e-Shop order has been cancelled.  For information on how to place a backorder, please contact Home Shopping directly, at (800) 434-****.  A Sales Advisor in this department will be more than happy to assist you. We apologize for any inconvenience, and we thank you for visiting IKEA online. Best Regards, KRISTEN IKEA e-Shop Sales"  Say  what ?!  By this time, I was livid.  I talked myself down  again , and wrote back:  "Does this mean that NONE of the items will be shipped, or only the items that are in stock will ship?"  I got this message in return:  "Order Number: 20*******     Order Reference Number: EO********** Your merchandise will be held for you for 48 hours.  If we do not receive a response from you confirming your order, your e-Shop order will be canceled.  Your credit card will not be charged until the following charges are confirmed: Subtotal: $70.45 Shipping & Handling: $37.16 Tax: $4.40 Order Total: $112.01 Here are two options for confirming your order: 1. Respond to this email by stating that you accept the above charges and we will use your credit card number ending with 4*** to process your order. 2. Call us at 1-800-434-IKEA (4532) with your order reference number.  Our hours are : Monday - Saturday, 8am - 10pm EST or Sunday, 9am - 8pm EST."  OK, so let me get this straight.  I placed an order on the website.  I am told that someone will contact me within 5-7 days, to let me know when it'll ship.  I'm not contacted.  I contact them.  When I do, I'm told that part of it won't ship, and that the whole thing's been cancelled.  When I ask for clarification, I'm told that if I confirm the order, I can actually get the whole thing, but only if I AGAIN take active measures and either email them back or call them to confirm that I wanted the goddamned things in the first place?!  Fuck that!  Needless to say, I didn't call or email.  They can keep their merchandise, thanks, and screw themselves.  Not like they haven't already.  My advice: DO NOT BUY FROM IKEA.  Any company that has such a pathetic attitude toward customer service (and online ordering, I might ad) does not deserve your business.  I'm done grousing.  Have a nice day.

       So much for shopping.  T & I were going to go to Geneva; I wanted to get some warm weather clothes (since it's practically summer and I'm still wearing long sleeves).  But the weather's sucked lately and today's no different.  Woke up to pouring rain, lightning, and what sounded like intermittent hail.  As much as I like shopping, I'm not going to risk dying in  urlLink Victoria's Secret .  We postponed.  This leaves me a bit aimless for the day.  Dozens of things that I could do, certainly, but nothing that's standing out from the crowd.  I suppose the item at the top of the list is to copy-edit my freaking thesis, but after getting through only the preliminary matter and the first 10 pages yesterday, I don't think it's a good idea.  I can handle the requirement that I remove about 1/8 of the commas that I originally used; I know that I overpunctuate.  But when I got to the page upon which I referred extensively to Hugo Grotius, the theoretical father of neutrality, I was met with something that I simply could not do.  In several places, I referred to "Grotius' theory" or "Grotius' directive."  And that's how I wrote it: Grotius'.  That is the possessive form of a word that ends in "s", as instructed by every teacher of English that I've ever had.  The reader of my thesis, however, informed me that, according to  urlLink Turabian , I needed add an "s" after the apostrophe for each of those possessives.   I cannot do that.   I pulled out my dog-eared, tea-stained copy of  Turabian , seeking a loophole.  There were none!  All seemed lost!  My eyes rolled up and scanned across the room...and came to rest on the brilliant orange spine of the  urlLink Chicago Manual of Style , the larger work upon which Turabian is based.  I grabbed that, flipped to the corresponding section, and found it--my loophole!  "6.30.  'How to form the possessive of polysyllabic personal names ending with the sound of  s  or  z  probably occasions more dissention among writers and editors than any other orthographic matter open to disagreement.  Some espouse the rule that the possessive of all such names should be formed by the addition of an apostrophe only.  ... The University of Chicago Press prefers the procedures outlined above [the rules as indicated in Turabian].  It is willing, however, to accept other ways of handling these situations if they are consistently followed throughout a manuscript.'" Sweet freedom from the oppression of least-common-denominator writing style!  I am consistent in my use of the possessive apostrophe, so it should be acceptable.  And why?  Because I do not want to sign my name to a thesis that has been bastardized by bad style.  This might sound like a peculiar topic about which to rant, but consider the source.  My writing is desperately important to me.  And this thesis, for reasons maybe more unknown and unknowable to me than to anyone else,  represents  me--as a scholar.  Seriously, it's very likely my last gasp in the educational realm.  I will not allow some new-fangled "everybody else is doing it" idea to make my writing look bad.  Not surprisingly, after the possessive debacle, the editing process was not smooth.  And I don't think I can force it, so I'll take some time away from it and try again tomorrow.  So, what today?   urlLink Collection development class ?  Yes, it's been looming over me, but I don't think that working during a holiday weekend is conducive to relaxation.  But I'm pretty keyed-up and relaxation doesn't seem likely anyway.  Maybe I'll go shopping anyway, just more local.  I need to get a new light fixture for the bathroom.  And a CD case for work, since we suddenly have music CDs laying all over and no place to store them.  And cards, since about a dozen birthdays are coming within the next month.  I need to get something for Debbie, too.  A peace offering--something to apologize for being an inconsiderate schmuck last Thursday.  I could explain why I did it but I think that endeavoring not to do it again would be more useful.  One thing that I should do is post the very few pictures that I took in Miami, which I finally had developed and picked up on Friday.  I'll scan them in later today if I think of it.

       What follows is a set of photographs of my hometown, Winona, Minnesota.  They were taken from an overlook during the winter.  The first picture shows the East side of town.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    The second picture is a slight shift to the west and shows much of the East lake.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    The third is another move to the west and shows how the East and West lakes come together at Huff Street.  If you look toward the top of the photograph, you will see another body of water in the distance - that is the Mississippi River, and beyond it, Wisconsin.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    The fourth picture is further to the west.  From this view you might see, comparatively, that most of the "older" part of town is to the east and that the newer growth has come in the west.  Winona is locked between the Wisconsin bluffs (and the river!) to the north and the Minnesota bluffs to the south (from which the photographs were taken), so there isn't much room for expansion in those directions.  Oh, I forgot to mention one thing: the Mississippi River flows from west to east past Winona.  If that's confusing, look at a  urlLink Minnesota map  and it'll make sense.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    The final photo is back to the east again, giving a more clear view of what's past the city in that direction.     urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink

       * Why did Blogger set up the profiles in such a counterintuitive fashion?  If one wishes to post a picture in a standard posting from  urlLink Hello , it's terribly easy.  If one wishes to post a picture in one's profile, it requires hosting it elsewhere and linking to it.  Why the convoluted extra step?  It should either be free or not free, easy or not easy.  * Why have I suddenly fallen desperately in love with a dozen bands that I couldn't have cared less for before?  I'm like an addict, craving time to listen to  urlLink Semisonic ,  urlLink Better Than Ezra , and  urlLink James , to name but three.  Co-worker T is probably pulling her hair out with the frustration of having had to listen to the same CDs over and over, but I just can't get enough.  I know everybody goes through musical phases, but this is ridiculous.  * What is the  armadillio  with  urlLink Three Junes ?!  National Book Award winner, maybe, but I'm 160 pages in and it's all I can do to stay awake.  I've faith in awarded literature but it's starting to feel...itchy.  * Every Thursday afternoon I have a headache that feels like a hangover.  * A certain half-bald co-worker who shall remain nameless left for lunch one day and failed to return.  The next day, this person (R) didn't come in for R's assigned shift, and didn't call in.  Yesterday, R called 10 minutes after R's shift was to have started, saying that R had just awoken and would be late.  R was not reprimanded.  By contrast, co-worker S "failed" to respond to co-worker M when M wished her a good morning, and S was given a written reprimand.  Hmm.  What constitutes 'favoritism'?  * 4 people came into my office to ask the same question this morning.  I'm either indispensable or an extremely poor communicator at work.  On that note, I'll get back to it.

       From the "Summer Plans" Department:  ::Learning to Ride::   Onesome: Learning --  Hey, what would you like to learn how to do this Summer? Learn to ride a motorcycle...? Learn PHP? Learn how to chill out and vegetate properly (lessons available  )?   I'd like to learn to use my blog like a pro, without having to constantly ask other people for guidance.  That includes buying and learning to use a digital camera and implementing photographs into the mix.    Unfortunately, a decent chunk of my summer's already devoted to learning how to write and implement a library collection development plan.  I don't think I'll have a lovely golden tan that'll last into autumn....    Twosome: to --  Too? Two? Okay, two things you are positively not going to learn how to do! Ever!  Skydive. Keep quiet.   Threesome: Ride --  Speaking of motorcycles: Do you ride? Did you ever ride? ...or do you just enjoy them? ...or maybe, "No way!"?  I don't currently, but I have (with others - never on my own).  Do I enjoy them?  Perhaps a good way to say it is that I'm not opposed, and I like the idea of others who I like, not being opposed.

       I recently had a fascinating conversation with a friend about our taste in art.  It began when we compared our preferences among the photographs posted by Jim Brandenburg on his  urlLink website .  While I can certainly appreciate the objective 'artistic value' of photography, and nature photography, generally, I cannot deny that some of these images are more appealing to me than others.  For instance, Day 17 (Heron, Pine, Fog) is one that I would choose, if I wanted to buy photographs to have in my house to look at frequently.  Day 25 (Sleeping Giant) even more - that's my top choice among all 93.  Part of the appeal is the water, I'll admit.  Growing up and spending my teenage years so close to the Mississippi River, I was always pulled toward the river when I felt like my life was in turmoil.  Watching the river go by helped me put things in perspective in the same way that some people feel from looking at the stars, I think.  I miss the presence of a real body of water in my life.  But I also like the contemplative aspect of the pictures.  My friend's response was that those are "very cold, lonely" photographs, which is true.  He then said something that I copied into my journal so I wouldn't forget it: "Happiness just isn't a very thoughtful emotion, is it?"  At the times of my life when I've been the happiest, I haven't spent any time at all ruminating on why or how I am 'happy'.  I haven't written in a journal, for instance, or tried to write poetry.  I've mostly just bobbed along without questioning what's happening to me.  As a result, those are some of the least memorable times I've had.  By contrast, the bad times - the heartbreaks, confusion, crises and sadness - are well-documented and remembered.  Am I tormenting myself?  Or is it a motivation for self-preservation that leads me to not forget the bad times?  Maybe if I can remember this pain, I can keep it from happening again, or at least be ready for it if it does.  There is a limited amount of space for art in any personal space.  The art that I choose to live with isn't there because it "looks good" or because someone gave it to me and I feel compelled to hang it.  It is there specifically because I want it to be there, so that when I see it, it makes me feel a certain way.  In my largest room, there are 3 large, 1 medium and 2 small prints by Mark Rothko.  (By "large" I mean around 37" x 30", certainly not actual size.)  The large ones are:  urlLink No. 6 - Violet, Green and Red ,  urlLink Earth and Green 1955 , and  urlLink No. 10, 1950 .  The medium one is  urlLink Untitled (green, blue, green on blue) 1968 .  One of the small ones is cream, pink and blue on rose, and the other is a much more abstract orange with yellow.  (I can find a link for neither.)    My point in listing these is that I acquired each of these intentionally with the exception of No. 10 - that was a birthday gift from a friend who knew that I admired Rothko's work.  He picked out No. 10 specifically because, he said, "It's happier than your other ones."  I hadn't set out intentionally to display "unhappy" art, but he'd picked up on the tone of the work without my having even realized that it was that way.  I find it soothing and complex, but others (apparently) see it as at least 'not happy'.    I do appreciate art that could be called "positive".  There are photographs all over my house showing people smiling.  But my greatest aesthetic pleasure is derived from contemplative, emotional, dark work.  And until my friend and I talked about this, I hadn't thought about it in terms of what I like to read, but it's true there, too.  A while ago (20 April) I listed the books that I've rated 10/10.  Of the 28 books listed, 7 of the reviews included some reference to being 'sad' or 'melancholy.'  The proportion was roughly the same in the list of 9/10s (from 27 April): of the 43, 16 were 'heartbreaking' or something similar.    There's no answer to all this - probably because there's no real question - but my theory is that the lack of some quality is necessary for the appreciation of that quality.  In other words, it's necessary to have experienced a lack of happiness to fully appreciate what being happy means.  Maybe this is intricately tied into my having fallen in love with philosophy as a freshman in college and to have heard Descartes speaking as if into my own ear and directly to my heart, but I think that to some extent it's true.  I didn't appreciate what friendship was until I'd taken it for granted and lost it for the first time.  I certainly didn't know the full value of money until I'd done the "write a post-dated check for rent/cash advance on the credit card/deposit the cash advance into the checking account so the check won't bounce" dance in college.    And what about love? "Why love what you will lose? There is nothing else to love." (Louise Glück, in "From the Japanese", in  The Triumph of Achilles )

       Title:  urlLink The Husband's Dilemma: Stories  Author: Nicole Stansbury  Review: This was hit-or-miss.  There were no outstandingly fantastic stories that I just adored. There were none that I particularly hated.  Most of them were something slightly more interesting than nothing at all.  It took  forever  for me to get through this 200-page book.  I guess I had wanted it to be  scathing  or  vitriolic  or  cathartic .  It was just…depressing.  Several of the stories were about a Woman Who Has Everything (i.e. a husband or boyfriend who works and provides for both or all of them while she stays home and cares for the house), whining about everything else that she wants, contemplating how she can acquire the rest of what she wants.  Quite a few involve women so freaky and irritating that it’s no wonder that their paper-thin spouses were driven to smack them around.  But why develop and  encourage  such characters?  Why create something so abhorrent, so stereotypical, and that contributes so much to the perpetuation of negative behavior?  This was a frustrating, eventually irritating book for me.  I shouldn’t have bothered to finish it, but it’s steadily becoming clearer that I don’t have the fortitude to bail out even for my own safety and happiness.  It wasn’t worth my bothering.  Rating: 5.  I borrowed it from the library because I was incredibly grumpy and disaffected when it came through the pipeline and it seemed to match my mood perfectly.  And the cover art is cool (woman in wedding dress and pink rubber gloves standing at a sink washing dishes).  But it's definitely not anything I'd want to look at again.

       I didn't bring enough for lunch, so I'm thinking about this topic.  Happy for me, there was a Friday Five (from 30 November 2001) to match my mood, retrieved from  urlLink here  via Google.   1. What did you have for dinner last night?   Breakfast - pancakes, scrambled eggs & sausage.   2. Do you ever get up for a midnight snack?  Nope.  I sometimes eat something right before going to sleep, though.  Last night it was 3 saltines (woohoo).   3. What's your favorite dessert?  This varies widely.  Favorite of all time would be angel food cake with White Mountain frosting, but that's time-consuming and no one makes it but me.  So, favorite dessert that I don't have to create for myself: chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  I make a killer Texas sheet cake (the kind with the cooked, poured frosting).     4. Tell us something about you that would surprise us.   I'm not sure that there's a satisfactory response to this.  I'm digging into the deep recesses of my brain.  The best that I can come up with on such short notice is that I have a great story about me and a guy whose nickname was Slimy Rick that I haven't taken the opportunity to tell yet.   Is that adequately surprising?   5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?  Tonight - tracking down T to congratulate/encourage, etc. re: the new job. Tomorrow - catching up on work.  Reading reviews, dealing with the first assignment in the collection development course, researching DVD/CD cleaning and repair units, and editing my goddamned thesis. Sunday - catching up on correspondence & making a new mix CD with which to torture my colleagues.  Tee hee.

       Since the current television season is coming to an end, we'll do the T3-TV Version ;)   ::Beginnings, Middles and Ends::    Onesome- Beginnings:   Are there any television shows out there that you've watched regularly from the very beginning? Or for those of you not into TV, any book authors that you've read from the very beginning?     urlLink Monk.   It's an excellent body work, progressing from one episode to the next and very much from one season to the next.    urlLink Enterprise.   Yeah, the theme music blows, but the show is an intriguing philosophical combination of the four that came before. [I won't take the time to comment on authors!]   Twosome- Middles:   What about shows that you came into in the middle of the season but immediately grabbed your attention and turned you into a die-hard fan? Again, for non-TV fans, have you ever begun reading a series of books in the middle and then just had to read everything else in the series?  I was cajoled into watching  urlLink That 70s Show  a year or two ago and now I can't  not  watch it.    I'll put in one author here:  urlLink Janet Evanovich , but only for the Stephanie Plum series.  And that's waning some because  urlLink To the Nines  showed clearly the cracks that are appearing in the facade.  I'll read  urlLink Ten Big Ones  but that might be it for me.   Threesome- And Ends:   Recently, a number of big name shows have ended, Friends, Fraiser, The Drew Carey Show, and the cult hit, Angel. Did you watch any of the big finales? Have you ever been really sad to see a show go? Ok, readers, here's one for you. Have you ever read the end of a book first? Why? ;)  Nope, I didn't watch any of the finales.  I had other plans, I suppose, or I hadn't watched the show in the first place.  Or I didn't feel compelled to arrange my time around something so contrived.  That sort of media manipulation pisses me off - particularly since no finale will never be done as well as the final scene of  urlLink St. Elsewhere .  I don't read the end of a book first.  I'm too linear (at least in reading) - there's no point in going back to start if I can see where the end is.

       Via  urlLink The Catalogue Blog , the  urlLink Librarian Stereotypes  questionnaire:   1. Own a cat(s)?  Yes, two, but they've lived with me since long before I broke into this profession so I hardly see why it matters.   2. Drive a small sensible, economical car?  Yes.   3. Wear comfortable, sensible shoes?  Nope.  Today I'm practically barefoot (Birkies), while yesterday's choice was my ugly but much-loved white-on-white Asics wrestling shoes.  (They're sort of like  urlLink this  only less flashy and have no black on them at all.)   4. Read constantly?  Yup.  In fact, I'm chomping at the bit to go to lunch so I can get back to my book.   5. Never go out?  Nope.  Can't get out enough.   6. Sexually inexperienced?  I'm torn between equal parts discretion (newly-found, but discretion nonetheless) and the desire to dispute the ill-conceived notion that librarians are somehow sexless.  I'll save myself by deflection - I don't think that I qualify as a "librarian", per se, as I'm not degreed.  So I don't have to answer.    7. Friends are all librarians?  Nope.  Lots of 'em are, but lots of 'em aren't.  (And lots of the librarians I've met couldn't be further from my notion of 'friend'.)   8. Could[n't] care less about fashion?  (Thanks, Annie, for correcting that common but egregious misuse!) This is a tough one.  Let's put it this way: I "care", but I don't obey.   9. Lean to the left when it comes to politics?  Yup.   10. Were a nerd in high school?  No?  I'm not sure if I can answer this accurately.  Perhaps someone who knew me in high school could.  I guess I wasn't at the top of the social heap, but I wasn't the bottom, either.  I had lots of friends.   11. Wear your hair in a bun?  Never.   12. Constantly covered in dust?  Yes.   13. Librarian by day/Bacardi by night?  Nope.  Now it's more of this: Slack-assed fuck-up who's playing music way too loud and internally screaming for Bacardi by day/Diligent student or full-timish librarian working on review journals, etc. at home by night.     14. Do you wear glasses?   Theoretically, but practically only when I can't avoid it.  I wear contacts 361 days a year.   15. Are you female?   Yup.   16. Abilities in the yarn arts?  Nope.  I can't even fold sweaters accurately.

       Went to Galena, Illinois Sunday with Tara and Lori.  It's a Mecca for wealthy Chicagoans who desperately need overpriced doodads with which to clutter their homes and lives, and who need to drive their Hummers 140 miles to buy them.  We - unlike those Chicagoans - just wanted to get the hell out of DeKalb and surrounds for the day and thought that Galena would be an interesting destination.  Lori had been there a couple of times before, T and I never.    The plan was to meet at my place at 10:00.  At 9:58, I was still getting ready, was dressed but my hair was about 1/20 done, had no clue what shoes I'd wear, and was freaking out.  The phone rang.  It was L, apologizing for running late.  I thanked her and said to take her time.  Headed back to the process of fixing my hair.  It's a complex process to spend time with the person who cuts & colors my hair.  I feel like when we're together, I need to show her that I've learned what she's tried to show me about how to take care of my hair.  So I work extra hard on getting it to "do" stuff.  That's probably why I end up looking like Rikki Rockett from Poison sometimes.  (Although his hair wouldn't be bad on a woman....)    Anyway, back in the b-room, curling, poking, tweaking, styling, spraying, begging.  The front door opened; T had arrived.  (I ask that she let herself in, 'cause she's family to me.)  She stood a respectful (and safe) distance away while I finished the hair prep process.  Amazing how it can look so weird while it's being curled and then so...mellow when it's done.  Not helmet-head at all, but just, like it was born that way or something.  L's a genius and what she's done with my head is magic.  After that, T & I talked and I made tea.  L arrived and we left around 10:45.  Not so bad, considering that I'm about that late for work most days.  (Sigh.)  The route to Galena from DeK isn't exactly direct.  We went to Rockford and took IL-20 West, so there was a bit of winding and turning.  But the day was flippin'  gorgeous  and we talked nonstop all the way there.  It has been raining so much lately that the sun seemed miraculous, but the temperature and the lack of wind was what made it perfect: probably 70°.  We all dressed differently, which I thought was striking.  I'm the slob of the group by a factor of 10, and I wore a little dressy  urlLink cardigan  (and it's actually in that blue color), an off-white satin-edged t-shirt, dressed-up sand-colored shorts and Eastlands.  L, who's the most dressy of us all, usually, wore a pullover-hoodie with a lace-up t-shirt under it and dark cargo pants with suede mules.  And T, who can be all over the spectrum but I'd describe as being the most hip of the 3 of us, wore jeans, a strappy tank, and a gorgeous turquoise blouse.    We stopped on the way there at "the big red barn".  That's what L calls  urlLink Roughing It In Style , a store in Lena, IL that sells all sorts of outdoorsy stuff.  Rough-hewn furniture and those HUGE bears to put on a porch to wave people in - that sort of thing.  The prices were mostly ungodly and the furniture was mammoth, so we weren't looking at anything very seriously.  I was tempted by the Canned Loon - not actual loon, the bird, in a can, but a can with a stuffed animal loon in it.  I thought it would be a funny gift for my dad.  They were really small (Beanie Baby sized?) and $12.95, which is beyond my comfort zone for a joke gift.  T liked the butterfly chair covers.  L was drawn to some jewelry boxes.  Naturally, I was the only one to actually buy something, but at least it wasn't wildly expensive.  I've wanted a thumb ring ever since I started watching Tony Bourdain on the Food Network (Howdy, JCL!) and they had some, and one actually fit my [apparently] oddly-shaped thumbs, so I got it.  However, that meant the seal on my wallet was broken, so in the car T, L and I talked about the importance of them sitting on me if I started indiscriminately buying things without regard to taste or cost.  I do that sometimes.  Off to Galena, then.  T and I were starving by the time we arrived.  L's more sedate than we are, and because she'd been there before she had reason to know how long it would be until she could eat again.  We, on the other hand, are " must eat now! " types, and we were starting to think that we'd never see civilization, much less a restaurant, again.  So L capitulated to eating first and shopping after.  We headed out to the place she's eaten before, which she didn't know the name of but said would be "at the other end".  I had no clue what she meant, and just thought that if I didn't get lunch soon, I'd cry.  Happily, no more than 5 minutes passed before we entered  urlLink Bubba's .  Doesn't sound like much, but it was heaven.  T had the New Orleans Guacamole Burger with sweet potato fries.  I had the Basin Street Cajun Chicken (I adore blackened food!) with regular fries.  L had French Quarter Chicken.  Fabu.    Once fed, I was happy as a clam.  (What does that mean?  Are clams actually "happy", or are they just stupid because their brains are small, so they're more accurately "blissfully ignorant" than truly "happy"?  Consider this!)  First stop:  urlLink Ink & Stamp With Sue .  Perhaps the largest independent crafty store I've ever seen.  Must've been 3 full store-fronts.  The first one is all rubber stamps and stationery.  The second is true art supplies, e.g. paints and stretched canvases.  The third is a mishmash.  Calligraphy (gorgeous!).  Books.  Journals.  Metal things --?  Tacky stuff (that's fun to look at), like the  urlLink Worst Case Scenario  books.  There was a small tray of plastic rings with hand-painted designs.  We each picked one out, deciding that they're not cocktail rings but rather Tea Rings.  They will give us powers beyond those of ordinary mortals when we wear them when we go out for tea.  Mine's clear but for 5 small black circles, each with a different colored center.  L's is white with 6 pink dots.  T's is red with abstractions, some of which are turquoise (and which matched well with her blouse, incidentally).  After we chose our rings (having to try on nearly the entire tray because our hands are different sizes and we have vastly divergent taste in tacky jewels!), L went to find the clerk because I was interested in more information about a small box in a glass case.  It would make a great addition to my collection of small boxes if it was in my price range, but I was concerned by its presence in the display case.  Not a good sign, in my experience.  I wouldn't have asked, even, but L's assertive where I'm... Minnesotan.  So off she went.  And then she returned, alone.  Puzzled.  "We're alone!"  "Huh?"  "There's  NO ONE else  here!"  We were completely alone in the store.  It was very Twilight Zone.  We wandered around for a while, eventually to the front of the store, and after a few more minutes saw the clerk - across the street, coming out of a store!  He waved and jogged over.  "Hey, sorry."  L said, "You shouldn't have left us alone!"  He scoffed, "Eh, this is  Galena ."  I said, "Yeah, but we're not."  T added, "We're wanted in 3 states."  He looked up, looked at each of us in turn, and said rather slowly, "Yeah, that's why you waited for me."  It was cute.  We all laughed and paid for our rings.  Next stop:  urlLink Main Street Fine Books & Manuscripts .  L wanted to ask about a book that she's been seeking, written by a family member.  The clerk was on an overseas call and put us off so we wandered on our own.  I was drawn into the fiction and poetry sections upstairs.  He had a first edition Edna St. Vincent Millay that tempted me mightily.  A Robert Graves, too.  But I held off.  T & L looked mostly at children's books.  We wandered in and out of a few more stores, none of which enticed us to buy anything but which were enjoyable enough in their way.  I tried on a sort of picture-hat which was more attractive than any I've tried before, but still not enough to buy.  L found a sweater she liked but at $132, it was well beyond what she was willing to spend for a short-sleeved sweater that may have contained 3 ounces of yarn.  T's eye was caught by a black shirt with a contrasting pink design.  We had wildly-overpriced ice cream.  We spent quite a while in a kitchen store (The Grateful Gourmet, which doesn't seem to have a website).  It's one of those little stores with tons of stuff where you don't want to move around much because it seems like you'll set off a chain reaction of crashing bottles and jars.  I got a  urlLink small teapot  (in the color "FB").    Then we went into  urlLink Poopsie's .  Wow - if you're ever in Galena, Poopsie's is the place to go.  The place is huge and spacious (like almost any other store, where you have to watch your elbows!) and light.  And fun.  I had a handful of stuff to buy before I was five steps into the store.  I'm a sucker for  urlLink Quotable Magnets  and I picked up two for myself (including one to match the mug that I have that reads: "Do one thing every day that scares you." [Eleanor Roosevelt]) and one for a friend that I'll send with a mix CD to a friend very soon.  I found a new set of  urlLink Extraordinary Chickens cards .    The most striking thing was the zodiac tile wall.  If you've looked at my profile, you've seen that I was born on 27 August but was due a full 2 weeks earlier, 13 August.  If I'd been born then, I'd have been a Leo, but I'm a Virgo.  I haven't generally put much stock in the whole horoscope/zodiac thing, but I do think that the contrast between the Leo and Virgo standard personalities is considerable, particularly since T's a Leo (although she's very much on the early side, almost enough to have been a Cancer, but that's another story) and we're very close but different in some key ways.  So, the tiles: there were two tiles for each sign, one nice and one "naughty".  That makes it sound as if one was scandalous or something, but it was actually more like one was positive and one was just honest.  Here are links to the  urlLink Nice Virgo  and  urlLink Honest Virgo  ones, and then lists of what they said: * [Nice] Virgo (August 24-September 23): Observant, Sympathetic, Dedicated, Helpful, Thoughtful, Witty, Reliable, Charming, Emotionally warm, Sensual, Analytical, Efficient, Compassionate, Industrious, Organized.  * [Naughty] Virgin: bitchy, overcritical, anal-retentive, fussy, pedantic, always complaining, always worrying, indecisive, demanding, obsessive-compulsive, argumentative, sexy as hell   Here's the  urlLink Nice Leo  and the  urlLink Honest Leo , and then lists of what they said: * [Nice] Leo (July 24th - August 23rd): Confident, Generous, Expressive, Gracious, Romantic, Clever, Loyal, Determined, Fun, Kind, Accepting, Courageous, Enterprising, Affectionate, Commanding, Encouraging, Noble, Irrepressible.  * [Naughty] Lion: arrogant and bossy, patronizing, jealous, brash, haughty, proud, cunning, pompous, lustful, over-ambitious, vain, controlling, interfering, smug, lofty, born to rule   If you know me, you can tell that I'm more Leo than Virgo.  I don't know why I'm letting it get to me, but it's been on my mind a lot lately and even moreso for the last couple of days.  Does this matter to anyone else?  Am I just letting myself get stuck on something that's beside the point?  I didn't even buy the tiles, in part because it felt like I'd need to get all four of them and that would be weird.  The last purchase I made there (besides some little devil horns that attach with Velcro - not sure what I'll use them for, but they definitely appealed to me!) was a  urlLink Pig Catapult .  It really must be seen to be believed.  It's a hand-held catapult that flings tiny plastic pigs "up to 15 feet or more", according to the back of the package.  The clerks at the store were oohing and aahing about the  urlLink Chicken Chucker , the companion piece to the Catapult, but they were out of stock.  It looked considerably more dangerous because the chickens are pointy.  I trotted out my "I'm an attorney" triteness and ruined everyone's fun in that regard.  I should've gotten a couple more Catapults to give to GL & GW at the next Online Cataloging meeting.  I think they'd have enjoyed them.  I guess I could get them online....  All too soon it was time to head back to the Flat part of the state.  We talked and laughed (and cried a little), and made plans for the future to the extent that it's possible.  It was a good day with very good friends.

       Thanks to Jenica for plucking this one out of the blogosphere:   1. What do you do for a living?  I am the Head of Technical Services at a large small public library in northern Illinois.  By large small, I mean that it's considered "small" in terms of the number of patrons served, but is on the highest side of that category in terms of the number if items and circulations per year.  My job is "supposed" to be devoted to original and copy cataloging non-periodical (i.e. everything except magazine and newspaper) library materials.  I also: split selection duties for all adult materials with one person and one idiot; process all newly- or retroactively-cataloged materials (that means I label and apply jackets, etc. as needed to anything that is new or substantially changed in my department); perform all media repairs and minor book repairs; and will, when the time comes, catalog and process the entire county law library in preparation for its move into the public library.   2. What do you like most about your job?  I'll follow J's lead on this one.   About my JOB? Selection.  Choosing library materials is a huge responsibility, but kid-in-a-candy-store fun, too, particularly when it's being done with grant funds that  I  pulled in  all by myself .   About my PROFESSION? (I'm looking at it from the cataloging standpoint here): The nerdliness - I love the specificity, the fact that there's an answer for everything if one will only page through the minutiae of  urlLink AACR 2002 ,  urlLink DDC22 ,  urlLink OCLC Bib Formats and Standards ,  urlLink LOC authorities , etc., to find it.      3. What do you like least about your job?  Working for and with people who are unsatisfied and angry, but unwilling to do what they know can and should be done to make the necessary changes.   4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...  Other staff members treat my office as a lounge, in which they can wile away the minutes in peace and yap their heads off about topics of no consequence, wasting their own time and mine.  The worst is when it's my boss and the person whose job I'm [reluctantly] doing.   5. What other career(s) are you interested in?  Writing something.  There are hints of opening an independent bookstore with a like-minded soul, perhaps with a sort of tea shop. I also make a really, really good secretary to the right person.  Sounds a little crazy but it's true.

       A few things I forgot to mention from that last day of the Miami trip: * the couple in front of us were verbally abusive of the F/A because she'd run out of Diet Coke (actually, all diet soda) before she made her way to their row when finally offering beverages.  The female half of the couple actually  cried  over the issue. * after sitting in the plane for 40 or so minutes on the runway, we began moving.  A small cheer went up.  It quieted and finally ceased when it became clear that we were simply taxiing - to another runway.  They moved us across the airport.  BNA is laid out like a sunflower and we moved literally from the top to the bottom  by land .  After a while it seemed like we were going to  drive  to Chicago in that tiny little plane. * very shortly before we landed in Chicago, the F/A broadcast gate numbers of connecting flights, informing those who'd missed theirs that other arrangements had been made.  There was a significant pause.  "Those of you who were going to connect to the British Airways flight to London Heathrow, please see a gate attendant."  The cranky, crying couple became profusely agitated at that point.  Ha!  I didn't feel the least bit sorry for them.  I think that if one's attitude is that poor about something as inconsequential as beverage service on what's basically a commuter flight, one deserves to lose overseas connections.  Hee hee.  Last evening I crafted a long response to someone who's sent several email messages to me recently without reply.  That's certainly a mark of a good friend.  In one of his messages he referred ironically to himself attempting to reform his cynical outlook, attempting to affect (as he put it) "an attitude of gratitude", although he admitted that the triteness of the phrase made him feel like the lowest-rent Jesse Jackson.  Now, this friend is even more cynical than I am, so his reformation is nothing short of startling.  And it - among several other things that've arisen in the past few days - spurred me to think about gratitude.   urlLink Robert  wrote a lovely, thought-provoking post yesterday about online friendship and what it's come to mean to him.  Although I wanted to leave a comment, there were too many disparate thoughts rushing through my head to make sense of any one of them.  Comment boxes seem to require something pithy and clear, not a mishmash of sentiment.  I had a very long, very intense conversation with a friend last night about the vast difference between humility and self-deprecation, and why it's  not  admirable to beat oneself up just because it's funny or easy or the first defense.    My point?  Gratitude.  I've written in the past that my friends mean a lot to me.  I've never clarified that, really, and now that I've gained some more insight into my own standard viewpoint, I want to try.  One huge reason why the people I consider friends matter to me is that they contribute to my feelings of community and support.  I don't mean physical community, because most of these people are far apart geographically, but intellectually, aesthetically and emotionally.  I love that sense of acceptance when I've read a book, that there's someone I can tell about it who will listen and be interested and who might even read it based solely on my suggestion.  And that there are people who care enough to tell what they've read, and whose opinions I trust and who won't steer me wrong in return.  It goes the same way for music and movies.  And politics and religion, although we don't talk about that very much (with one recent exception).  My use of the word "support" is in the emotional sense - there's someone with whom I can connect if I choose to do so, but there is also the mature understanding that we're all adults with our own lives, so if we're not immediately accessible, it's not criminal or personal.    When I respond with gratitude, I sometimes overdo it.  I hadn't realized that until last night.  I don't mean to imply that I'd be nothing without your friendship, or that I have nothing without it, or that you're my lifeline.  Connections are immeasurably valuable and pleasurable but each of us is, in the end, responsible for ourselves only.  What I do mean is that some of these relationships are   transcendent   - they're beyond what I've had before, and I appreciate that.  It took me a long time to grow up; maybe it's still in process.  And I haven't always been cognizant of what I've had until I lost some things - or people.  Once I realized that it was necessary to  consciously   express  my gratitude, it became increasingly easy to do so - to the point that it began to sound less than sincere.  Now that I've become aware, I'll try to remember that and not go so far.    That wasn't very coherent.  Hope it made sense and that its meaning is accepted.  In conclusion, I offer today's poem.  This is something I'm shooting for doing at least once a week, a nod to  urlLink Orvstuff .  This is, as was the last, from Louise Glück.  Called "Palais Des Arts", it is part of 'Descending Figure' in the  urlLink First Four Books of Poems .   Love long dormant showing itself: the large expected gods caged really, the columns sitting on the lawns, as though perfection were not timeless but stationary--that  is the comedy, she thinks, that they are paralyzed.  Or like the matching swans, insular, circling the pond: restraint so passionate implies possession.  They hardly speak.   On the other bank, a small boy throws bits of bread into the water.  The reflected monument is stirred, briefly, stricken with light-- She can't touch his arm in innocence again. They have to give that up and begin as male and female, thrust and ache.

        Sunday, 18 April 2004   Breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  Buffet - wonderful.  Truly the best breakfast buffet I've ever seen.  Brioche French toast, fresh strawberries the size of tomatoes!, waffles, Canadian bacon, pancakes, fresh raspberries (my absolute favorite food of all time), pastries, perfectly-cooked bacon, freshly-squeezed orange juice.  Ungodly expensive but delicious.  Ate like a pig.  Taxi from the hotel to the airport.  The drive wasn't bad, and we shared a cab with Joe of 'mojito = bush' fame.  He was heading back to Toledo, Ohio via Newark, NJ.  Not exactly a direct flight.    We got to the airport in plenty of time.  Checked in, got in line to drop off checked baggage.  The "lines", of which there were 8?,  all fed into one  line at the end!  My irritation level at the moment I realized that was close to 100%.  Absolutely idiotic.  I understand that they didn't have 8 x-ray machines, but why have 8 lines?  Why not have 1 long, squirmy line that actually  moved , rather than 8 lines that  didn't move ?  Yargh.  Even dressed as I was, in a t-shirt and shorts, I was boiling.  (I surmised that it was fever from the sunburn.)    Despite our direct flight to Miami, on the return we were to stop in Nashville.  The first leg was scheduled from 10:45 to 12:02, and it came very close to that.  After Miami, the Nashville airport seemed pristine, spacious and sparsely populated.  We plunked down to wait for our 2:10 flight.  T was a little chilly in the A/C, wearing capris, a t-shirt and a hoodie.  2:10 arrived, but our plane didn't.  Announcement: "Due to weather in Chicago, our flight is delayed 1 hour."  Crap.  Bought another bottle of water and a cinnamon roll, pulled the books back out of the bags, and sat back down.  T was so cold by this point that she was tempted by buy an over-priced and ugly garment from a gift shop just to stay warm.  3:10 - we loaded.  I noticed as we walked down the death-tube (walkway? corridor?) that connects the gate with the plane that it was at a markedly steep angle that I hadn't experienced before.  Once we turned the last corner, it became clear; we were on the smallest goddamned plane in existence.  I don't remember the model, but it was something like "Baby Whir-Whir 60", because the thing sat 60 people, and it was so small that  I  banged my head on the ceiling when I stepped onboard.  Some of you might be either laughing or gasping right now.  If you don't know how tall I am, I tower over anyone who's 5'3" or shorter.  Yup, I'm 5'4" or so.  And  I  hit the ceiling with  my  head!  That's criminal.    So we taxied out to the runway, whereupon the flight attendant (hereinafter F/A) brought out tiny Dixie-Cup sized cups of water and Cream Savers.  Cream Savers?!  What the hell?!  I wasn't expecting lunch, but a Cream Saver?!  It all became clear once she'd returned to her little tiny seat at the front of the aisle (there was no 1st Class, see, so my view of her was unobscured by the status curtain).  That's when she rang the doorbell in the cockpit and the co-pilot came on the intercom to let us know that..."Weather in Chicago is delaying our takeoff by at least 40 minutes.  We thought we'd get you loaded and taxi out, just in case we get a break in the weather."  We were stuck in a tiny metal tube the size of a sardine tin and they weren't going to take off.  Cell phones came out all around, people bitching like crazy: "Can you believe that they're just going to keep us here?  This is ridiculous!  Blah blah blah."    I was annoyed and more than a little claustrophobic, but I could also see the point of not taking our little Campho-Phenique tube straight into the teeth of the wind.  I was less worried about getting there on time, and more worried about getting there  alive .  We finally took off at 3:50,  ten minutes after we were to have landed  in Chicago.  At least we took off, though.  The flight wasn't bad.  The landing was even relatively smooth, perhaps because we were expecting to find our teeth poking out of our foreheads given the 50+ mph gusts as we came down.  Circling repeatedly over the Lake and eventually approaching from the north, via Waukegan and surrounds, was weird. But we finally arrived sometime around 5:00.  It was warmer in Chicago than it had been in Miami!  85° in Chicago, around 72° in Miami.  So crazy.  Took the tram to the parking lot, then the bus to the parking lot, then walked to the car, which was hotter than Hell.  Drove through relatively light traffic, feeling like the car was going to flip over at any moment.    Home, lying on the couch with a cat on my lap and one in my arms, eyes closed, none of it mattered except having been there.  Vacations - at least the kind that give some mental time off - are worth any trouble.  When, and where, is my next one?

       "Here is some advice that is worth remembering, from Edward Everett Hale, Helen Keller's friend--  'I am only one, But still I am one. I cannot do everything, But still I can do something; And because I cannot do everything. I will not refuse to do the something    that I can do.'"  Sometimes you think you're just retro-cataloging crap-assed musty collective biographies (e.g. a 24-year-old copy of  Helen and Teacher  by Joseph P. Lash), and then you open to the verso and out jumps something that makes you think.  I don't mean, it makes you think     something , but it makes you  think .    And so I sit and think a minute, about the something that I  can  do.    Maybe I  can  do it.

       From the "Found on the Desk" Department: ::Fax Cover Sheets::   Onesome: Fax --  Do you have access to or use a fax machine at home? Just curious...   Have access to, but don't use.   Twosome: Cover --  Hey, summer's coming! What type of cover up do you use when you're out in the sun? SPF4000? Sun clothes? A hat? "What sun; I live in a cave?"  Intend to, but don't, use SPF 45 or thereabouts Neutrogena sunscreen.  The stuff that doesn't smell bad and doesn't make everything break out.  I'll put it on once and then forget about it and get burnt.  (See, e.g., several Miami posts below.)    I look ridiculous in hats.  I  work  in a cave, but I don't live in one.  Even though sometimes it feels like I live at work.   Threesome: Sheets --  120 count or 180?  I was shopping for sheets online last night - trying to decide between the 220s and the 250s from Lands' End.  Investing in new bedroom furniture very soon, so the expensive sheets are [fairly justifiable] gravy.

       In a dream you asked, “Why me?”  Here’s the answer, in a list:  * Insouciance * The ability to remain silent, whether in the face of silence or of situations rife with temptation to comment * The way you thrust your hands in your pockets when you walk *  What?  * Cheekbones * Bravery in the midst of storms * Still waters... * Lankiness * The conversations (rare!) are treasures * This kind of tension can’t be imagined

       What do you think?  Too blue?  It seems really, really blue to me, particularly on the laptop at work.  Annie's voted - she likes it.  Lora likes it, and says it's blue but not too much like Jenica's.  (I noticed that they're similar when I popped from mine to hers.)  I needed a change, you see; I'd grown weary of the gray.  Is it too monochromatic?  I'm curious to know what it looks like in to those who aren't creating it.  The last day of the Miami trip, long overdue.   Saturday, 17 April 2004   We hadn't made any plans the day before, but we had a vague idea that we wanted to see  urlLink Villa Vizcaya  and the area south of where we were staying.  The problem was that it wasn't within walking distance, we were tired of paying for cabs, I was sunburned to within an inch of my life and T was also pretty red, my blisters were handled with the Band-Aid things but I still didn't want to make them worse, and we were just  tired .  We'd also been drinking every night and that was sucking the life out of us to some extent - alcohol and hot weather meant we were dehydrated a lot of the time even with all the water we were drinking.  So we woke up late  again  on Saturday morning.  Ate breakfast at the Starbucks cart in the hotel lobby again, like little sheep.  I had a fabulous croissant and orange juice; T had a muffin and milk.  Afterward, we sat and talked for a while, contemplating getting a cab and doing things, but eventually decided that we just didn't want to.  We grabbed our books and a couple of bottles of water and headed out onto the Riverwalk.  We watched the river go by and read until it became uncomfortable to be sitting on the cement, and then we headed to the pool.  I couldn't sit in full sun because I'd have burned to a crisp so I was in shade down to my waist with my legs in the sun.  They glowed as if I had no color at all.  T was almost all in the sun.  We read out there for several hours.  Lunch from Starbucks - in the lobby - was a shared chicken Caesar salad and a bottle of Coke.  Wonderful, just right.  We just lounged around through the whole day.  The pool was good for people-watching.  There was a girl (20-years-old?) in a bikini who was good for our body-image, because she had to outweigh either of us by a good 30 lb. but she was completely unphased by that fact; she stalked around the pool yammering on her cell phone as if she was the only person in attendance.  There were two British med students there, too.  Guys.  One was really good-looking, the other one not so much but the fact that he was (1) sitting by the pool of a hotel in Miami, (2) in April, (3) wearing a reasonably attractive swimsuit, (4) reading a good book, (5) while British, made up for anything he might've been lacking in the looks department.  Yum.  OK, moving on.  Dinner was something special.  We met up with friends and took the  urlLink MetroMover , which is a free, automated sort of trolley-thing on a track that goes around the downtown Miami area.  We went to the Bayside Marketplace, to  urlLink Bongos , which is an authentic Cuban restaurant owned by the Estefan family (i.e. Gloria Estefan).  It took forever to get there after we got off the MetroMover because it's located behind the American Airlines Arena (where the Miami Heat [of the NBA] play) and the arena is huge, and yes, we walked the wrong way around.  But it was worth the walk because the food was amazing.  I wasn't drinking, again because of a headache, so I ordered the funkiest thing I could find that wasn't alcohol: Iron Beer.  It turned out to be like Root Beer, sort of.  Well, more like Cream soda with spices, really.  An acquired taste, I'd say.  But my actual food was great - Vaca Frita.  Pieces of tender pork, marinated with garlic and onions.  Black beans, rice and sweet plantains on the side.  I'm not going to lie and say that plantains are now my favorite food, but I did eat them and appreciate them.  Apparently the sweet plantains were vastly superior to the fried ones that a friend ordered.  I had a lovely, mellow rice pudding for dessert.  Bongos is a huge restaurant with amazing vaulted ceilings.  The bar stools are functional bongo drums.  After 11:00, they push the standard tables off the floor and the place turns into a dance club.  I'd have liked to have seen - but not heard - that.  It was well loud enough while we ate.  And for no apparent reason, the same song played over and over and over while we were there, literally dozens of times.  One of our friends asked about it when we left and the wait-staff just rolled their eyes.  "Yeah, it's enough to drive you crazy!"  The management claimed that the CD player was on repeat, but judging by the waiters' response, that wasn't quite true.  Again, back to the hotel, back to the bar.  To bed fairly early, because our flight was scheduled for 10:45 AM.

       This is a direct, specific request.  There's a person to whom I've referred, obliquely and not so obliquely, over the last few weeks in this venue.  There's a permanent link that pertains to something of personal meaning to them.  I've wondered for a long time, and with increasing intensity, whether you've been reading.  If you are,   please   let me know it.  Use the email link to the right or leave a comment, even anonymously, indicating that you're out there.  Knowing whether things are negative, positive, or neutral would be amazing, but I'll take whatever I can get.  I'm at the end of my tether, a state of which at least one friend can attest.  In the words of  urlLink James , to whom I (and certain others) listened this morning,    You're as tight as a hunter's trap Hidden well, what are you concealing Poker face, carved in stone Amongst friends, but all alone Why do you hide   Say something, say something, anything I've shown you everything Give me a sign Say something, say something, anything Your silence is deafening Pay me in kind   Take a drug to set you free Strange fruit from a forbidden tree You've got to come down soon (More than a) Whole lot of drug is what I need Need a change of scenery Need a new life   Say something, say something anything I've shown you everything Give me a sign Say something, say something, anything Your silence is deafening Pay me in kind   Say something, say something, anything,  I’ve shown you everything Give me a sign  I'm open wide, open wondering Have you swallowed everything Pay me in kind

        urlLink The Thursday Threesome :   Onesome: Something old -  Do you have anything that you've owned simply forever? A cherished childhood toy, an antique handed down through the family...   An ancient copy of  Amy's Long Night  by Nancy Garber.  The covers fell off when I was maybe 8 years old, about the age of the Amy in the book, who decided to stay up on the night of her 8th birthday with her dog, George.     Twosome: Something new -  Buy anything new lately?   Other than the rampant consumerism pre-Miami, there hasn't been much non-book buying lately.  I ordered some photographic supplies from  urlLink Light Impressions  and  urlLink bookends  from Kitchen-Plus.com.  Does that count?   Threesome: Something borrowed -  Ever borrowed anything and never returned it?   A leather-bound copy of Walt Whitman's  urlLink Leaves of Grass  from my high school library.  I loved the book so much that I couldn't do without it.    I felt guilty at the time, and every time I saw it or read it, and every time I thought about it.  As soon as I could afford it, I replaced it with a new leather-bound copy with a cash donation tucked inside.  It doesn't make up for what I did.   Bonus: Something blue -  See anything blue from where you are? What is it?   The jacket to the CD that's playing (The Housemartins'  urlLink Now That's What I Call Quite Good ), parts of my shirt, the apple in which Professor Frink resides (Frink Different!), postcards, Cubs uniforms.

       Background Music: Erasure, "Star"  The new  urlLink Poet Laureate  is Louise Glück.    This poem is  too  amazing.  I'd cut off a finger to be able to write like this!  If you know me at all, you know what I mean.   "The Triumph of Achilles"    In the story of Patroclus no one survives, not even Achilles who was nearly a god. Patroclus resembled him; they wore the same armor.  Always in these friendships one serves the other, one is less than the other: the hierarchy is always apparent, though the legends cannot be trusted-- their source is the survivor, the one who has been abandoned.  What were the Greek ships on fire compared to this loss?  In his tent, Achilles grieved with his whole being and the gods saw  he was a man already dead, a victim of the part that loved, the part that was mortal.

       I'm sacrificing myself on the altar of my blog, telling y'all something incredibly embarrassing for no reason other than because it's good for the story.  Does anyone know who Tom T. Hall is?  If you don't, he's a Country-Western singer, popular (if that's the right word) in the 70s.  He had a song called "I Like Beer" that's beside the point except that Lori and I have sung it together to odd effect.  And he had this song, which holds a place within me.  I'll share the lyrics, and then I'll explain.   Tom T. Hall - "I Love"   I love little baby ducks, old pick-up trucks, slow movin trains, and rain.  I love little country streams,  sleep without dreams, Sunday school in May, and hay.  And I love you too.  I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends, birds of the world, and squirrels.  I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups, bourbon in a glass, and grass.  And I love you too.  I love honest open smiles, kisses from a child, tomatoes on a vine, and onions.  I love winners when they cry, losers when they try, music when its good, and life.  And I love you too.   My parents used to play albums (yeah, albums, the old wax 33 1/3 things that one put on a turntable and to which one applied a needle, that were scratchy and had character - those things) all the time.  Lots of country, but also old rock-n-roll and some folk and blues and a little jazz and classical.  Every now and then they'd edge toward the truly modern, but they'd usually take a detour and it'd be scary, turning out to be something like Rod Stewart (who wants to listen to  that   with their parents  when they're 13?!)  So I grew up listening to Buddy Holly, Patsy Cline, the Everly Brothers, Charley Pride, Charlie Rich, Tom T. Hall, George Jones (w/ and w/o Tammy W.), Dolly, et al.  And even though I sing worse than I dance, I sang along with everything, and I have an encyclopedic memory of song lyrics.  And Tom T. was one of our favorites.  We'd listen to "Faster Horses (Younger Women, Older Whiskey, and More Money...)", "I Like Beer", "Old Dogs, Children & Watermelon Wine", and "I Love," and sing along - often while driving to relatives' houses.  I think we probably played through the tape that we made off the album.  (Yeah, JPR, it's a long-standing tradition.)  So I've had this song running through my head for a while.  Ever since someone donated a Charley Pride CD to SPL, as a matter of fact, on March 1.  That made me think of the old songs, including "I Love."  For a while I thought I'd try to rewrite it with stuff that I love, but it would be way too hard.  I'm no songwriter.  Instead, I'll just make another list, a counterpoint to yesterday's rant, to state emphatically what I love.  1. Garlicky dill pickles, not too sour, preferably Gedney's (it's the Minnesota pickle)  2. Playing music really, really loud on the way home after a long day at work.  Currently alternating between "Send Me on My Way" by Rusted Root (I bought  urlLink When I Woke  specifically for that song - how high school!, but I love the whole thing) and "When I Come Around" by Green Day.    3. Baseball.  Cubs win!  Cubs win!  Greg Maddux is so amazing.  But I'd be uniformly happy if  urlLink Eric Karros  was still in blue.  Good for the field, and invaluable for the clubhouse.  4. Not being quite as poor as usual.  Don't get me wrong - working full-time is for the birds (don't take offense, Robert - I mean no harm to the winged creatures), but the increased salary is compensation for my pain.  5. Sleeping late.    6. Staying up late.  7. The extra-soft fur on my cat Hobbes' cheeks and neck.  And the extra-sleek fur behind my cat Pooke's ears.    8. My parents.  Beyond being great parents, they're good friends, wonderful support, fabulous cheerleaders, excellent company, interesting correspondents, and worthy role-models.  Were I to end up in their shoes as a full-fledged adult, I'd be a success on all counts.  (And no, they're not reading this - they know nothing about it.)  9. Coca-Cola.  Nectar of the Gods.  Juice of heaven.  I don't drink nearly as much of it as I used to, so I enjoy every drop a hundred times more.  Joy in a can or bottle.  (Or from a fountain, but only if unavailable from a can, first, or bottle.)  10. Nail polish.  I have scrubby, weak nails from processing and the skin on my hands is dry from winter, but I still love nail polish.  I'd buy bottles of it every time I got a haircut if Lori would let me.  Which she won't.  I did get a bottle today, though -  urlLink OPI "Chapel of Love" .  Very pink.  11. Buttered toast.  12. My friends.  The ones I spend lots of time with in person, the ones I see once in a while (or will see this summer for the first time in too long), the ones I haven't seen in too long but keep in touch with through email, and the ones I've made through blogworld.  Empowering and humbling at once.  And I'm grateful.  13.  And I love beer, too.  Tee hee.

       It's Pet-Peevy day.  Join me.  1. The indiscriminate and egregious use of the word "gentleman."  People, that word implies integrity, courtesy, and chivalry.  It's NOT a synonym for "man."  Don't use it when you mean "man."  When you mean "man," use the word "man."    2. Driving 5 mph under the speed limit on a cloudless day on dry pavement at 8:45 in the morning.  Guess what?  The crazy-looking person behind you is  late for work !  Drive, or get the fuck out of the way.  No more of this namby-pamby half-assed maybe I'll drive if I get around to it shit.  3. This is a gimme, but sometimes it has to be said: People who want something - a favor, say - and who can't handle the interchange correctly.  I have a coworker who does this in one of three ways:   a) "You probably don't know this..." b) "You might not be able to do this, but..." c) [favor given]  [door closes behind her]  [Me]: "You're fucking  welcome !"  That phrasing comes in response to her inability/reluctance/unwillingness to say Thank you, ever, for anything I do for her.   Amazing as it may seem, it makes me unenthusiastic about going out of my way for her.  4. RPL's jackass attitude about sending (that is, not sending) materials that they've agreed to share with other libraries.  5. DPL's moronic attitude about cataloging.  [knock, knock]  Hello?  Anybody home?  Fill in your fucking 300 fields, people.  "|h[large print]" isn't going to add itself to LP records!  Believe it or not, the rest of us can tell when you've done something stupid, so stop doing it.  (Or, more specifically,  start  doing the right things!)  6. Patron requests.  Why do people ask for the most esoteric stuff all the time?  I can't tell you how many freakin' pro-Bush and anti-Bush books we've had to buy because some idiot  had  to have them  right now .  Have those books changed their lives?  I certainly hope so, because they've cost us a ton of money and shelf space.  7. Book budgets.  Don't even get me started.  The fiscal year began on Saturday and we're already a month over budget.  Swell.  8. People who jog on really busy streets during really busy times of day with no concern for the fact that they are literally in mortal danger.  Driving on Wolf Road in Countryside IL on Saturday night around 5:30.  Two lanes in each direction, full of cars.  Jogger, probably 2' from the curb in the lane I was in.  Where exactly am I supposed to go?  Legally, she's supposed to be given a lane of clearance by any car that meets her, so everyone in the lane she was in should've (legally) either stopped completely or pulled into the left lane, which was (practically-speaking) impossible.  Seriously, what should we have done?    9. Drivers who, when something's in their lane, swerve into another lane when they could slow down for a second to avoid the thing in their lane.  I know it's less convenient to decrease your fucking speed and I realize that wherever you're going is vital to YOU and that's all that matters, but this is MY lane, not the extra one that's here in case you need or want it, so don't just take it when you feel like it, jackass.    10. Drivers who slow down or swerve to avoid birds flying past their cars.  (I'm talking about small birds like robins, not potentially dangerous fowl on the order of geese.)  It's a bird!  It ain't gonna kill you.  And if you kill it, it isn't going to feel it.  And if you hit my car because you swerve, or if I hit your car because you slam on the brakes to avoid a goddamned bird, not only will I sue you for everything you  think  you're worth, but I'll also beat you until you can't see a bird again.  Or until all you see are birds.    This venting is really fun.  I should do this more often.  11. Meetings.  No point.  Some people come to yap, some people come to appear helpful, and some people come because they're forced.  Email is the only effective way to communicate.  12. Baseball.  Did anyone see the Cubs games on Friday and Sunday?  Why is Dusty Baker taking the Jim Riggleman approach to managing, i.e. leave the relief pitcher out there to fail when it's clear within 2 pitches that he doesn't have it?  I've never seen anything in baseball as emotionally painful as watching Kyle Farnsworth throw ball after ball last night - it was as if he was pitching blindfolded and wearing mittens.  Sometimes they don't have it, and when they don't have it, they shouldn't be abandoned.  Particularly in St. Louis.  Particularly in a game in which the starting pitcher threw that well.  It's games like that that make serious fans not want to watch games.  13. Cold spring weather.  Boo.

       Going to a wedding this afternoon.  An old friend and her long-time boyfriend.  Although I always like weddings, the direct, same-day feeling is always, "Do I  have  to?"  So depending on when I get home I'll either write tonight or tomorrow about how it goes (i.e. whether my anticipation is justified), and also cap off the Miami trip, which I've allowed to dangle for too long.    Bon weekend, y'all.

       Wretched weekend.  How could it be anything else, when the majority of it was spent hunched over my desk like a drone, capitulating to the insanity of removing completely necessary punctuation from my genius product alternately with adding completely unnecessary punctuation to it?  All the while desperately needing a haircut, so every two minutes I either blew my bangs out of my eyes or shoved them back distractedly.  I drank more tea (i.e. injested more caffeine) than any human needs.    That being said, there were several bright spots--the ones that actually make up for wretched weekends.  The things that will make even the most cynical person think that it doesn't all have to suck all of the time.  * Email messages with friends.  Yes, I've whined lately about certain people ( Robert?   Hello?  ) who don't respond to their email in a timely fashion.  But who am I to complain, really, when I'm not all that good about it most of the time?  However, I've had a couple of particularly pleasant, satisfying, comfortable, happy exchanges with a couple of particularly good friends over the last few days.  Public acknowledgement is in order but it wouldn't be appropriate, so I'll be sneaky instead--"tweaker of roundies," thank you.  And "cutie even at that age," thanks.  You knew what I needed and you did it, and there's no greater measure of friendship.    * Good books.  There are only a couple of people who might possibly read this who might possibly care, but I'm reading the best book right now.  I'll review it soon, but not on this page.  (That should tell you something of what it's about.)    * Old friends, and lunch therewith.  Sometimes you'll connect with someone and then circumstances will arise that cause that connection to strain, and it can even seem like it's broken.  But, as happened to me yesterday, sometimes you realize that it's just been stretched a little but if anything it's even tighter than before.  Because you reveal more about yourself each time you're together.  About what's really important, and what's at stake.  I have only one more thing to say on that subject:  Buy the damned camera!  Life is too short to wait for the perfect camera at the perfect price!   * The right box at the right time.  I was sitting at the computer, poring over the Bibliography line by line (and in some cases letter by letter).  I had Turabian's  urlLink A manual for writers of term papers, theses, and dissertations  and  urlLink The Chicago Manual of Style  propped open in front of me.  Numerous scraps of paper with barely-understandable notes scrawled on them, such as this:   search by ):_ and replace with ),_ if  BOOK  cite! search by ),_ and replace with ):_ if  JOURNAL  cite, idiot!   Better Than Ezra  urlLink Deluxe  on repeat on the CD player, although it was too mellow to really do it for me.  Tea, iced, in my Brother's beer mug (free from a bar in Winona, filled with beer on your birthday.  I got mine when I was 24?  Maybe?).  I was working hard, cranky, about 2 hours beyond the point at which I'd had quite enough, when I heard the unmistakable sound of the mail being delivered.  The mailbox is attached to the railing on the front steps but the carriers always make it sound like they're punching a hole in the wall when they fill the box so it startles me and sends the cats into a frenzy.  Once we calmed down I was a little disappointed because JPR's been writing about sending a box...for a while...and I could see no box on the railing.  Sigh.  So I went back to work.  Grrr.  Finally went out to get the mail after I'd finished another page of scouring the bleeping source list for errors, when my eyes were about to bleed from reading so closely.  Bliss!  A box, on the welcome mat, in JPR's familiar script!  I picked it up and it made a strange jangling noise--a note, hand-written in ink on the address label: "Rattle OK."  Hmmm.  I took it in the house (screw the rest of the mail!  Goodies for me!!), grabbed a knife, and wrenched it open.  Woohoo!!!  Shotglasses for my collection, from Montréal and Potsdam.  More CDs than I could listen to in a week, which is ok since some of them aren't for me.  The top one definitely was, though--"Amy Mix 6/2004."  Warm and fuzzy from 831 miles away.  Beaded necklaces, which I immediately put on, rendering my look somewhat 8-year-old-ish but imminently happier than I'd been 2 minutes before.  A letter.  A card.  Subtext.  I listened to the Amy Mix while I was doing the last look-through on the thesis, checking to make sure that I'd made all of the required corrections or explained why I didn't.  Damn!  The first time through, I felt more than a little, er, disconnected.  I had no clue what more than half of the songs were or who was singing them.  But the second time through I was past that, listening more closely to the lyrics and-- damn.   You knew.  I love it, and I have the feeling that this is going to end up being rather a disc of anthems before everything's said and done.  (How prophetic is that?!)   * I'm distracted now from whatever else I was going to write because I'm thinking about how unbelievably good I felt when I saw and opened that box.  It lasted through this morning when I dressed in my I Want to Move to the Caribbean style.  White linen shirt, loose linen shorts (tan), suede sandals,  urlLink To Dive For Pink  nails (OPI), new pearl and green beaded necklace, silver on black cord anklet.  I'll Do It When I Get To It attitude.   urlLink Closer  on the CD player for now, but the Amy Mix coming soon.   I'll take the wretched if I can have the sweet that comes with it.  Thanks to those who helped make it that way.

       What follows are some of the things growing outside of my house right now.  Dark blue petunia.   urlLink      Same flower, close up.   urlLink      And again.  Would've been nice if I'd moved that blade of grass, hmm?   urlLink      These are some sort of lily, but I'm not sure exactly.   urlLink      Same lilies, close up.   urlLink      The best photograph of the ones that I took yesterday, in my judgment.  I was experimenting with the Macro function on the camera, closeups from a very short distance.   urlLink      The camera is really just  too  much fun.  I highly recommend the digital route to anyone who hasn't tried it.  Although I appreciate film and don't foresee completely abandoning it, the flexibility of taking so many more shots with no risk makes digital hard to beat for practicality.

       * I checked out a book from the library.  The book is called  Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity , written by David Allen.  It's been on the coffee table since I brought it home.  I think it's already overdue.  It now feels like much more than a book that I haven't started--it's become symbolic.  Maybe I'll start it tonight....  * I mentioned some "fan mail" recently.  There have been 4 unsolicited, unexpected communications, actually.  One could literally be called fan mail, although that's a stretch.  I think it was more of a subtle plug for the person's book; they probably read enough of the blog to realize that I select fiction for a public library and designed their email message around that.    The second was a comment that I replied to by email, in which I asked how the blog was discovered.  To my great chagrin, it was a rather complex trail that ended in these search terms: naked skydiving.  I've never used it as a phrase before, but the individual words existed on the blog.  (Yeah, like how many times have I used "naked"?  I shudder to guess.)  I'm pleased that the person who found it that way chose to remain once the more prosaic nature of the site was discovered.    The third was an email from a Family-Oriented Search Engine, soliciting my site for Premier Status.  Apparently "someone" found this blog using the above-referenced engine and so I was being offered the opportunity to Make More Money by becoming a Premier Member.  I was curious, so I clicked through and discovered that for the low, low price of $50, premier membership would be accomplished.  The gain for me is questionable, particularly since my Family-Orientedness is in question.  The very day that the email arrived, I wrote the ill-considered but humorous and popular  urlLink Bacon  post.  The fourth, received last night, was an email message from the author of a book that I recently reviewed.  How cool is that?!  I was thrilled!  But...there was a problem.  It was  not  a positive review.  The email message, however, didn't acknowledge that.  Not at all.  And I suppose if one's written a book, any press is good press, and any links are good links.  But I sort of slammed the book.  Sort of called her characters by bad names.    What am I supposed to do with this?  Does this add yet another layer of "I need to be more careful about what I post" to the already complex formulary of this blog?  Do I need to consider this before I post book reviews in the future?  Or can I just push it aside and assume that she's the exception in authors who will bother checking to see who's reviewed their stuff online, and also that she's the exception in those who would specifically take the time to comment when a review's less than positive?  I'm at a loss.  * I just finished editing the body of my thesis.  There were two pages that contained no editing marks.  Two!  Pages 74 and 79.  There's no way to adequately impart to you the disgust, stifled rage, and despair that suffused me when I realized that.  I know that I should be able to take it more philosophically and remember that it's not a reflection of the way that I write, but only of that particular (and very single-purpose) document.  But holy crap,  two  pages?!    All that's left is to re-write the entire Bibliography according to some peculiar and archaic style that I'd never even heard of until today (yes, I should have known about it before, but that's the problem of thinking you know everything about something like writing), rechecking page by page to make sure that I made all of the minute changes that the reader demanded, and then reprinting it and Express Mailing it to Ypsi.  Out of my hands for another couple of weeks.  * Discovered this morning [goddamnedfuckingbullshit] that I'd failed to return a form in response to my summons for jury duty.  Another thing that I'd have realized if I'd bothered to read past the part that pissed me off.  But in my own defense it  wasn't  very clear and I was  really  pissed off.  So I dashed it off this morning and sent it out...only 8 days late.  If that is the only thing that prevents me from being excused, I'm not sure what I'll do.  * With aid from a knowledgeable (and/or enthusiastic) source, I'm building a new blog template rather than nudging this one into a different format.  It'll take longer, but it'll be a vast improvement.  Didn't realize I'd have to learn CSS in the process, and since HTML is still new to me, it's a struggle.  But it's also kind of fun and definitely cool to have someone smoothing out the rough spots with me.  I might even spring for Blogger*Pro and ditch the top-line ad at the same time as the new template is launched.  Time will tell.

         ::Capricious:  Governed or characterized by impulse or whim, lacking rational basis or likely to change suddenly::    Onesome: Characterized by impulse--  Do you consider yourself impulsive or do you tend to think everything through before you make a move?  I like to consider myself thoughtful and contemplative, but my true nature is increasingly coming through.  I'm impulsive, and I'm more often pleased and comfortable with the results when I just go with my instincts rather than overthinking.    Twosome: lacking rational basis--  If you are impulsive, do you rationalize and justify your actions? Like, since that item you bought on a whim was on sale, you really saved money by buying it?  I guess I was looking at it in a more long-term fashion, but yeah, I do rationalize.  How can you not?  Otherwise you're saying, I'm not in control of myself and that's fine with me.  What a scary thought.    Threesome: or likely to change suddenly--  When you make up your mind, does it stay made up or do you tend to change your mind at the last minute? ...or do you waffle back and forth until you're forced to decide?  There's some waffling, but only because I  know  what I want and my id's working to talk my superego out of talking me out of it.  I shouldn't say "waffling" then--it's more like debate, but from the start I know who's going to win.  Maybe it seems to others like I waffle and change my mind at the last minute, but I know all along what the decision will be.

       Spent too much time thinking lately.  Bloodshot eyes, crinkled forehead, tension headache, cranky.  Try to remind myself that I'll never figure it all out so there's no sense in trying so hard, but it's counter to my nature to just let it go.  It would be a hell of a lot easier if other people weren't being so obstructive, but I guess if I was rational I would acknowledge that I knew it was like that all along and work around them.  Having tea tonight with T & L.  It'll be good for me, particularly if they do the talking.    Yargh.  No more thinking.  Just read--today's poem.   urlLink Whoever You Are, Holding Me Now In Hand   by Walt Whitman     WHOEVER you are, holding me now in hand, Without one thing, all will be useless, I give you fair warning, before you attempt me further, I am not what you supposed, but far different.  Who is he that would become my follower? Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?  The way is suspicious--the result uncertain, perhaps destructive; You would have to give up all else--I alone would expect to be your God, sole and exclusive, Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting, The whole past theory of your life, and all conformity to the lives around you, would have to be abandon'd;  Therefore release me now, before troubling yourself any further--Let go your hand from my shoulders, Put me down, and depart on your way.  Or else, by stealth, in some wood, for trial, Or back of a rock, in the open air, (For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not--nor in company, And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,) But just possibly with you on a high hill--first watching lest any person, for miles around, approach unawares, Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea, or some quiet island, Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you, With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss, or the new husband's kiss,  For I am the new husband, and I am the comrade.  Or, if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing, Where I may feel the throbs of your heart, or rest upon your hip, Carry me when you go forth over land or sea; For thus, merely touching you, is enough--is best, And thus, touching you, would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.  But these leaves conning, you con at peril, For these leaves, and me, you will not understand, They will elude you at first, and still more afterward--I will certainly elude you, Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!  Already you see I have escaped from you.  For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book, Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it, Nor do those know me best who admire me, and vauntingly praise me, Nor will the candidates for my love, (unless at most a very few,) prove victorious, Nor will my poems do good only--they will do just as much evil, perhaps more; For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit--that which I hinted at; Therefore release me, and depart on your way.

       People sometimes ask me why I haven't made the commitment to get an MLS [yet].  The 15 June 2004 issue of  urlLink Library Journal  provided a good answer to that:  Top 10 Annoying Responses When You Tell Someone You're in Library School: 10. I'd love to be a librarian because libraries are so quiet. 9. I thought about becoming a librarian, but I need enough income to support myself. 8. You need a graduate degree for that? 7. I thought the Internet put libraries out of business. 6. Don't you have enough college degrees now? 5. I think it's wonderful that you can pursue a hobby like that. 4. You have to go to college for that? 3. I don't see much purpose to libraries; I buy all my books at Costco. 2. I'd love to be a librarian because I'd love to read at work. 1. You have to go to school for that?  [Jane G. Gresham, School of Information  Resources & Library Science, University of Arizona, Tucson]  Found at:  urlLink Friday's Feast  via the  urlLink Meme Freak  and  urlLink Sweet Memes .  The Meme: The Feast    Appetizer What is your middle name? Would you change any of your names if you could? If so, what would you like to be called?   My middle name is Dawn.  I'd change it.  It came from my mom's sister--her favorite sister, I thought--and I loved that when I was younger.  When my mom had cancer and my aunt didn't visit or call, having a part of her as part of me became significantly less valuable.   Besides, "Amy Dawn"?!  It's either childish or good for porn.  The main value to me has always been in filling out forms - it's short.  Let's just say that I don't find my name to be representative of the way that I see myself.   Soup If you were a fashion designer, which fabrics, colors, and styles would you probably use the most?  Leather, linen, cotton.  Black, blue, gray, white.  Styles - ouch, I can't say 'cause T's got me scared of my own style shadow.  Tee hee   Salad What is your least favorite chore, and why?  Cleaning the cat box.  If you've cleaned a cat box, you know why.  If you haven't, you don't need to know.   Main Course What is something that really frightens you, and can you trace it back to an event in your life?  When I was pretty young our neighbor's dog (a German Shepherd mix) had a large litter of puppies.  I didn't know  anything  about dogs, and ran across the yard to get someone's attention.

       Mondays.  Often the time when we take a few moments to contemplate the weekend past and the week to come.  What does it all mean?  Why do we do it?  Why do we expend so much energy on stuff that doesn't matter, missing out on the those things that--and people who--do?  Saturday was another thesis editing day.  I cannot express how frustrating this is.  Yes, I care too much about it.  Yes, I take every little comment and criticism personally.  But these changes are  mandatory  unless there's justification to not make them, so if I feel strongly about them, I need to provide that justification.  That means I spend the majority of my so-called editing time making photocopies of and highlighting articles (to prove that funky punctuation didn't sprout forth from my imagination but is English English or Irish English rather than American English, for example), and re-typing whole sections of Turabian just so I don't have to change a semicolon into a colon.  Why am I teaching grammar to someone with a Ph.D. in English?!  And why am I doing it when there are 33 days until this fucking document has to be signed, copied and ready to be bound in order for me to finally collect this stupid degree?  Sigh.  I'm on page 57.  Only about 46 pages to go.  Later on Saturday, when I could not stand one more minute of wanting to scream over my thesis, I drove around the metropolis running errands.  Picked up a package that had been delivered to the library: a huge box of clothes that I'd ordered in a moment of weakness.  I knew I wouldn't want to keep all of it, but I was surprised by what I did keep.  Some frightfully professional-leaning pants--the professionalism mitigated by the flowy, almost ethereal quality of the linen.  A couple of cotton lawn shirts (camisoles required).  A weird, sort of Caribbean-like embroidered blouse with 3/4 sleeves.  (Weird because it's not something I would've chosen two months ago but it looked great on.)  Also picked up a couple of gift certificates at the salon and...more OPI lacquer (it was on sale) in  urlLink Grape Wall of China .  Not only do I love the name, but it's a very cool color.  (If you click the link, it's not the color in the bottle, but the stripe below.)  Drove around for an hour or so afterward.  Nice day.  Cool.    Saturday night, dealt with some photography issues.  The learning curve with a digital camera is extensive.  Main problem: setting the image size to a  smaller  one, and the image quality to a  higher  one.  I just need to read the manual.  Also filed a pile of old photographs from my sophomore and junior years in college in an album.  It was a little depressing, very hilarious, somewhat melancholy, and totally weird.  I haven't seen some of the people pictured in a dozen years, and I miss some of them more than I could possibly explain.  I found the one photograph that I ever took of my friend Traci Jacobsen [Kauphusman]...and it's no wonder I never framed it.  She's passed out on a disgusting-looking couch at the Parking Lot House, wearing the micro-est of mini-skirts.  I'll just leave it at that.  Sunday.  Shopping in St. Getavia with T.  Lots of talking since we haven't seen each other in way too long.  Went to J.Jill to get another white t-shirt like the one that I absolutely love.  They sold out.  (Grrrr.)  Picked up a couple of things at the VS Semi-Annual sale.  (Like they don't have "sales" all the time at which their things are only expensive, instead of ferociously expensive.  I'll pay it and not complain.  But the next time someone asks me if I have an Angels card I'm ripping their head off and bowling it out the door.)  Sandals.  My weird hair conditioner, which isn't available closer than 30 miles to home.  Seeking an AC adapter for the camera, but couldn't come up with one.  Another bottle of OPI -  urlLink Aphrodite's Pink Nightie .  Lunch at Friday's, before which I was dead-on checked out by a guy walking out with his wife and kid.  It was hilarious and ego-boosting and sad at the same time.  (He was unbelievably gorgeous, which helped with the second of those attributes, to be sure.)  Last night, wanting to work on a project but not able to devote the time that I wanted to it.  Feeling pulled in different directions.  Knowing what I  want  to do, but it's not always what I should do.  I don't work well under those circumstances.  Trying to maintain perspective.  And it's raining today.  Doesn't it always rain on Mondays in Illinois?

       Title:  urlLink In the Stacks: Short Stories about Libraries and Librarians  Author: edited and with an introduction by Michael Cart  Review: This sounded fascinating when I first heard about it.  I started reading it at Christmas and realized that I was wrong in that assessment.  The paperback version is nearly 270 pages of 8-point type, 19 short stories about two relatively dry subjects.  I’ve had to force myself through the majority of the collection.  Three of the stories were outstanding: "Summer Librarian" by Sue Kaufman, "Rubber Life" by Francine Prose (who is, incidentally,  not  a favorite of mine), and "Exchange" by Ray Bradbury.  A couple of the others were so dreadful (or just dreadfully dull) that I couldn’t finish reading them, something that I find very difficult and depressing.  And in a compilation like this, it just pisses me off because the stories—and their inclusion—only serve to foster the misperception of libraries and librarians as dull as dishwater entities.    I can say that  In the Stacks  earned a 7 solely on the basis of the three above-named stories, although there were several others that contributed to the book’s quality.  However, I’d have happily paid more than the $14.95 cover price to have done without about 6 of the others.  [Sigh.]  Recommended with reservations.

       Title:  urlLink My Daughter's Boyfriend  Author: Cydney Rax  Review:  Wook.   OK.  First, I want to acknowledge that the author of this book has a BS from Eastern Michigan University, and for that I feel a sense of kinship, perhaps, that mitigates the force of this review.  Now, with that dealt with, I can move on.  For the sake of clarity while I was reading, I assigned nicknames to the 3 main characters to keep their attributes straight in my mind.  Lauren, 18 years old, is "Belligerent, Irritating, Troubling, Cold 'Heifer'" (that last bit is something that Lauren’s friends call her, apparently an African American thing that I’m not getting at all, a reminder that this was so not written for me.)  Tracey, her mother, is "Confused, Unmotherly, Narcissistic Tart."  Lauren’s boyfriend, Aaron, is "Poorly-drawn, Lying, Arrogant Yet [oddly] Attractive Homey."  The plot, in a nutshell: Lauren and Aaron are dating.  Aaron, who’s in his 20s, wants to "take their relationship to the next level."  Lauren’s not ready, in part because Tracey’s constantly harping on her that she shouldn’t turn out like she (Tracey) did, having a child while she was a teenager.  So Lauren’s going to wait.  Well, Tracey’s boyfriend, "Mr. Steve," dumps her.  And she’s feeling low.  And Aaron’s always been kind of  attentive and friendly.  So when he makes the moves, she reciprocates.  Yeah, she does her daughter’s boyfriend.  Lauren’s father (with whom Tracey hasn’t had a relationship in several years) catches them together in a hotel and forces Aaron to break things off with Lauren, which he’s been planning to do anyway.  A few weeks later, Lauren catches the two together at the apartment that she shares with her mother.    The rest of the book is people chuckin' accusations at each other, suffering recriminations, and generally feeling bad about everyone around them and themselves.  I’m not sure what the point was, to tell the truth.  It seemed like what Lauren and Aaron had was a childish relationship, and what Tracey and Aaron had was somewhat closer to an adult-type relationship, albeit extremely poorly-chosen and badly carried-out.  But their affection for each other was presented as real for ¾ of the book and then suddenly it was yanked away as justification for what they’d done—it was all colored with the 'Dirty' pen.  And the hapless reader was left feeling somewhat ill-used by the whole experience.  Why did I invest 3 days' time in reading this book, if it was going to turn on me like this?    Ugh.  Too much introspection.  The book's not worth it.  It's a 6, and I think I'm being generous in that.  Maybe that's the titillation factor, even.  Unless you're wowed by the idea, don't bother.

       This stack of files (and other highly-important stuff) is on the desk next to my thesis computer.  urlLink     Sometimes the bleakness of my books has to be broken up by something unexpected, like a box of chicken notecards.  urlLink     When I was in college, I dated a guy--very briefly--who came to be represented by this little piggy.  urlLink     The pig now hangs from a shelf upon which my cats enjoy the sun.  urlLink     While I was taking these photos I realized that there's another pig hanging in the house.  How weird is  that?!   urlLink     Finally, this is a shelf of some glass things and odd-sized (and subjected!) books.  urlLink

       One of the most common questions I've gotten, as an attorney, is, "Can I sue  X ?"  The answer is simple--you can sue pretty much anyone you please.  The question you should be asking is, "Will I  win ?"  For an example, you might want to take a quick look at the case of  urlLink United States  ex rel  Gerald Mayo v. Satan .    (My favorite of the reasons that the case was not allowed to continue was "plaintiff's failure to include instructions for directions as to service of process.")

        ::Things that go bump in the night::    Onesome: Things that go -  What's the strangest contraption you've ever had to use to get from point A to point B?   The Miami MetroMover, probably.  The thing just sounds rickety and weird.  The escalator at the Bethesda Metro stop (Wisconsin Ave. at Montgomery Lane in Bethesda, MD) on the Washington, D.C. Metro Line is pretty freaky - it's the world's longest (tallest?) escalator.  A boy who had a crush on me in high school took me for a ride in his dad's 6-seater (?) plane, too, but that's a story for another day.    Twosome: Bump -  Have you ever hurt yourself doing something you weren't supposed to be doing?  When I was 9, maybe, I was home alone on New Year's Eve and naturally couldn't be content with eating Doritos and drinking Dr. Pepper until I burst, so I had to...rollerskate in the house, something which was  strictly  forbidden.  After turning up the volume on Dick Clark's Rockin' Eve, in the process of skating backward (something that challenged me during the best of circumstances and on the smoothest of surfaces--textured carpeting not being one of them) I lost my balance and, flailing madly, slammed ass-first into the edge of the couch.  Bruised my tailbone.  To say "bruised" implies something more mild than this, though.  I landed 100% on my microscopically small tailbone, which was then forced through all of my internal organs and into my throat.  My whole back, my butt, and my thighs turned black and blue (and yellow - it was lovely!).  I couldn't sit, or stand, or lay down comfortably for a month.  And I couldn't tell anyone what had happened, see, because I'd be admitting to having done it in the first place. The real beauty of this story is that I'd won a radio contest that required me to go the station to retrieve my prize.  Conveniently, since I was a child, my brother had received a Christmas gift that he needed to return in the same town.  Hmm, if he was old enough to drive, I couldn't have been 9.  I must've been at least 12.  Fuck.  That makes me sound decidedly more idiotic.  Anyway, the day after this all happened, Big Brother drove us to the big city to do our errands.  In his Jeep Wrangler.  On the bumpy, beat-to-shit-by-winter Minnesota highway.  I thought I was going to die. Man, that story hurts.    Threesome: In the night -  Do you believe in things that go bump in the night or anything supernatural?  I'm not exactly sure how to answer this.  My first response is that there are enough things to be afraid of that  are  real, and that I don't borrow trouble.  But I am prone to seeing signs sometimes.  So I'll say, sometimes, in some ways, maybe.

       Some of you may recall my decidedly ill-advised foray into a discussion of the erotic potential of bacon cologne on men.  (If you haven't read it and are now curious, see  urlLink The Perfect Scent .)  However, I've been wildly, horrifically outdone by  urlLink Marie Claire  magazine.  The July, 2004 issue contains an article entitled, "What's Your Guy's Secret Turn-On?"  One of the subsections is  Bacon .  I could not hope to do it justice without direct quotation, so here it is in its entirety:   "Dave, 32, writer. 'I'm not certain how I got into bacon eroticism, but I think it goes back to my childhood, when I'd wake up Sunday mornings to the soothing aroma of bacon.  In my mind, bacon equaled comfort.  When I got to high school, I was intimidated by the idea of sex.  But one day, I was sharing a BLT with a girl I really liked, and after a few bites, I had the confidence to make my move.  Soon, I had a hard time achieving arousal without bacon.  I began to use strips of bacon to, well, pleasure myself, and also rub on my partner, coating her with juices I would lick off with delight. 'In college, I felt comfortable enough to "break out the bacon" with more women.  The cafeteria had bacon every morning, and I'd often sneak a few strips back to the dorm.  Even if it wasn't actually part of sex, the bacon was always nearby, a "sexual night-light" of sorts. 'Most women I've been involved with are surprised by my fetish, but many are willing to indulge me--besides, when it comes right down to it, everybody loves bacon.'"   [Amy's editorial comment]: not  that  much...

       But there've been changes nonetheless.  The trip was cancelled, essentially for reasons outside of my control.  I'll go soon, just not this week.  Instead, I went to a consortium meeting yesterday after getting way too little sleep for the second night in a row and feeling rather horrid.  (BTW, I laughed my ass off singing along with "Follow Me" by Uncle Kracker on the way up.)    The meeting itself wasn't that bad, all things considered.  Almost no one there.  Short agenda.  Not much discussion.  Nearly complete agreement on nearly everything, although a great deal of that is the inertia of the Barely Breathing.  Lunch plans w/L (The Cataloguer) afterward.  Didn't realize until we were nearly inside the building that the Ground Round is closed and being renovated.  Came as a surprise but mostly because we were just wandering in without paying attention.  Ended up at The Bagel Place.  Had a lovely bacon sandwich, which reminds me of something that I'll need to write about soon....  The trip back was uneventful (no snow) but for the old lady (circa 1850) driving 100 mph in the passing zones, 50 mph in the no passing zones.  Could've clocked her across the head if I'd caught her, which I naturally did  only in the no passing zones !  Bizarre afternoon.  Some miscommunication that later got cleared up in a big way thanks to 20th century technology (I finally got a cell phone and I can already see that it's going to make my life a  lot  better).  I'm learning how to use the digital camera.  Change can be good.

       This was one of those insular weekends where I spent far too much time thinking and too little time breathing fresh air.  It left me ruminating on some things that I need to get out.  ~ Spent another five painful hours on Saturday editing the thesis.  During one of those hours I did nothing but flip through the five boxes of note cards that help make up the bulk of the document.  When I sat back to stretch out my stiff back, I realized that I was gazing down at the cards and boxes with an odd sense of pride and warmth.  I love those cards.  They still fascinate me.  And as much as I fucking hate it, my thesis still fascinates me.  I sat there on my living room floor and pondered that idea for a while and it simultaneously thrilled and repulsed me--I may be the world's foremost authority on Spanish and Irish neutrality in World War II (with the possible exception of my thesis advisor, I suppose, although even he would probably demur that).    What the hell?  How did I come upon something so esoteric?  Something so unsexy?  Something about which I cannot speak without sounding as if I'm lecturing, since  no one  knows anything about it?  And after it's pulled so much of my soul from me, not to mention the headaches and hand cramps and other practical problems, how can it still make me want to plunk down on the floor and just read even more about it?    ~ Memes.  I like them.  I struggle with "muddying up" the blog with them, spending too much time on them, distracting from the real point with them.  I've considered curbing my enthusiasm for them, limiting myself to specific ones, or setting up a separate blog for them.  However, my final analysis is this: it doesn't matter if no one cares.  They work for me as writing and psychological exercises.  They make me think, about myself, writing, html, my friends, and all sorts of other things for which I'm not going to apologize.  I'm not under any illusion that any person reads every word I write, so as for memes--if you don't like it, don't read it.  ~ Email is frustrating me in both ways lately.  I spend too much time reading it and not replying, feeling like a creep for not staying in very close contact with the people I want to be closest to.  Blowing people off is such high school behavior for me and I should be able to prioritize better than that.  But I also send messages to people about whom I care, and I'm [apparently] blown off in return.  So that irritating urge strikes, to send another message asking, "Did you get my message? Is everything ok? Why aren't you writing?"  Fuck it.  Perspective.  My priorities are mine, but they're not everyone else's.  It doesn't mean that I won't wonder if some people have fallen off the side of the planet, but maybe I can feel less like whining about it.  ~ I'm dashing home for a couple of days this week.  My band director from high school is retiring and there's a roast for him.  It brings up lots of happy memories.  Yeah, I was one of the weird ones in high school, hair flopping over one eye and the long coat and all that, but it wasn't an actual trench coat and my hair was always clean.  (Does that make me a poseur poseur?  I can still hear Shawn Nelson's voice, hear him screaming, "Fucking POSER!"  Or trying to cajole me to do something that I knew I shouldn't do, positively  crooning  in my ear, "Sweeeet leafffy beeeeeeef!")  Band was almost uniformly fun--yargh, no pun intended--and the director was a good guy in all ways.  Naturally I have the usual regrets and second-guessing about my high school experience, but I'm completely happy to be able to drop everything to go back for a couple of days to say thanks to someone who did a lot to make it good.   ~ The blog template--I'm going to make a    radical    change.  Not sure when yet because it'll take a monstrous amount of changes.  Feedback desired when it happens.  ~ "Follow Me" by Uncle Kracker.  Is it a good song or a nasty song?  I'm still undecided.

       Title:  urlLink Playing James  Author: Sarah Mason  Review: I have nothing bad to say about this book except that it has a dumb cover and a title that’s almost completely unrelated to the subject matter.  Other than that, it’s great.  Holly Colshannon is a newspaper reporter who’s stuck on the pet funerals beat, wondering if she’ll ever have the opportunity to do actual journalism.  When the crime reporter bails for a gig in London, she gets her big chance—she’s assigned to replace him.  Unfortunately, things begin to go awry almost immediately when the PR woman at the police station cooks up a scheme to enhance the department’s reputation.  Holly is to create a newspaper “diary” featuring Detective Sergeant James Sabine—chosen because he’s going to be married in 6 weeks and so the department wants to “protect” him for his big day.  Holly and James are to spend every working day together, and mix like oil and water.  Holly’s accident-prone.  James is impatient and abrupt.  James’ fiancée, Fleur, is the perfect lady.  Holly’s boyfriend, Ben, is an easy-going rugby player.  What could possibly go wrong?  It’s not predictable.  It’s fun, a quick read, and surprisingly thoughtful.  And even if you  think  you know how it’ll end, you don’t.   So there.     It's a 9.  Check it out from a library or buy it - you  will  like it.

       Title:  urlLink Three Junes  Author: Julia Glass  Review: One of the best books I have ever read.  It's difficult for me to say that after having taken so long to get into it, but it turned out to be so much more than I'd have imagined.  It's a Damn book--the kind that, when I've finished it, I turn the last page, sit back and say, aloud, "Damn."  And I sit there for a few minutes and ruminate on how different I am from when I began reading this book.     Three Junes  is a triptych of sorts, a novel in three overlapping parts.  Yet it's also a very cleverly designed study of two characters whose lives don't intersect throughout the book.  Much of my frustration with the early section of the book was that it didn't seem to be  going  anywhere.  That would have been alleviated (or eliminated completely) had I been more aware of what was coming.  (I generally avoid specific reviews of something like this because I don't want my own appreciation of it skewed by a reviewer's opinion.)    Once into the second June, then, I was engrossed in the story of Fenno McLeod, a Scot living in New York but frequently traveling to his home country.  And by the time I reached the third June, it was all I could do to put the book down and do ordinary things like sleep and eat.  How can I not be moved by lines like this one: "'Never talk yourself out of knowing you're in love,' he says, 'or into thinking that you are.'"?  Or a character who thinks this way, when asked by his young [French] niece if he is feeling sad: "I put an arm around her.  'No, sweetheart, not sad.  Not exactly.  But... mon coeur est fatigué. '  It is the simplest explanation I can find; how could I tell her that my heart is in fact imploding?"    There is much about this novel that I adored and that I wish to immediately fall back into and read again, now that I know more.  And there are some things about it that I might have done differently, had I done them myself, but I do not mean to imply that I didn't love it.  This is a 10, a book that I will read again--and recommend to anyone who's not afraid of thinking.

       From the "School Daze" Division:   ::School Bus Stop::    Onesome: School --  Since the school year seems to be over (your mileage may vary: some of you are already in summer sessions!): what was your favorite year in school? Yeah, the one you had the best time in or learned something special or had that learning breakthrough?  My favorite year in school was my senior year.  I'd finally developed into something other than an abject dweeb so I had something to do every night that I wanted to be "out".  I worked more than 20 hours a week so I had a ton of money to spend on all my bad habits--mostly gas and boys.  And even though I was busier than I'd ever been, my grades were also excellent.  It was a great year.    Twosome: Bus --  Hey, how did you get to school in the early years? Walk? Bike? Mommy van? Bus? ...and for those still attending, how are you getting to and fro these days?  Bus.  We lived 7 miles outside of town on the top of a hill.  My bus came at 7:25 AM and half the time I was 3/4 asleep for the trip.  I wouldn't get home until almost 4:00.  I had some truly good friends on that bus, though.    Threesome: Stop --  ...and when did you stop going to school? ...or did you? Are you still at it? Amy plans to go back for those who are out of the system?  Did anyone else read that closely and see that my name is there rather than "Any"?  I think that's fucking priceless.  As for my answer to this question, I'm still not goddamned through editing my thesis, so I'm still going.  And I always think of going back, or what the next degree might be.  Everybody needs a Ph.D., right?  If only someone would pay me enough that I'd feel like I could stop looking for something else....

       * The Hallmark card that always gets me, no matter how many times I see it: front cover shows an ethnic-looking man in a turquoise spandex unitard liberally decorated with sequins, gazing into the middle distance.

       In honor of the me I used to be, hiding behind a notebook in high school and always wearing shorts in defiance of public opinion, I offer two Mind Humps from  urlLink Blog Drive Insanity  (inspired by Jenica's  urlLink Meme Freak  and Lora's  urlLink Sweet Memes )...   This week ... a getting to know you hump!    urlLink       01.  You are a source of light.  What are you and why?  I'm a candle.  Natural, powerful, regenerative, painful (but only if treated incautiously), and fascinating--particularly when I'm being watched by someone under the influence.   02.  There's a huge neon sign above your head everywhere you go ... what is it flashing?  Caution?  No, seriously, it would be something like this: "Deep Water."   03.  If you could be anyone's blog, whose would you be and why?  (Provide a link to that blog)  Oh, God, this is  sooooooooooo  tempting!  I can't answer this the way that I want to answer it (all I can say is, the comma goes outside the quotation marks!).  So I'll have to use my second best option, which is actually a very, very close second and a very easy choice: Jenica's  urlLink I'd Rather Be a Mermaid Than a Flame .  It's thoughtful, interesting, hilarious and scathingly funny, erudite, welcoming...everything I'd like to be.   04.  If you could have a vanity phone number, what would it be and what would it spell?  See, this is why I'd never have a vanity plate--my brain just doesn't work in this direction.  But if really, really pushed, I'd say...276-7848 (2smrt4u).  Yuck.   05.  Look around you .... name two odd things in your vicinity and explain why they are there.  1. Two-headed dinosaur (toy) in tiny cardboard "basket" tied with red ribbon, accompanied by a note that reads:     Dear sir or Madam-    I regret to say that I can no longer take care of my young, two-headed, dino-esque offspring.  You may not be aware of it, but dinosaurs are now actually extinct.  You see how this makes my situation difficult.  How can I feed two mouths, miniature yet voraciously hungry, when I am extinct?  I ask that you please take care of my plasticated child, the last of this certain unknown breed of dinosaurs that is not, in any way, related to the dreaded thunder lizard.  I am sure that he/she/they will bring you much love.   Thank you, Anonymous     2. A mix CD called "What Do You Think?!"   **********************************************************    The Meme: I say, you think...   01. bright : light 02. twister : John 03. marshmallow : cream!  For shaving!! 04. bud : vase 05. master : yes 06. blink : once 07. [suave] : and debonair 08. bikini : wax (ouch) 09. dash : off 10. elementary : Kosciusko  Fascinating, eh?  Back to work.

       I was in a perfectly fine mood when I hopped in the car this morning, a good 35 minutes late for work before I even left the house.  It was warm (73° then, 79° now), sunny, and just a decent day all around.  But I wanted something kind of... 'cranky' on the CD player, so I popped in Jenica's mix for those Dodgeball days, also called the "I just need to scream really loud" mix.  Thus, this is how I, for all intents and purposes, started my day socially:  Limp Bizkit - "Break Stuff"   It's just one of those days  When you don't wanna wake up Everything is fucked Everybody sucks You don't really know why But want justify Rippin' someone's head off No human contact And if you interact Your life is on contract Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker It's just one of those days!  [chorus] Its all about the he says/she says bullshit I think you better quit Lettin' shit slip Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip Its all about the he says/she says bullshit I think you better quit talkin' that shit (Punk, so come and get it)  It's just one of those days Feelin' like a freight train First one to complain Leaves with a blood stain Damn right I'm a maniac You better watch your back 'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program And if you're stuck up You just lucked up Next in line to get fucked up Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker It's just one of those days!   [chorus]  I feel like shit My suggestion is to keep your distance 'cause right now I'm dangerous We've all felt like shit And been treated like shit All those motherfuckers that want to step up I hope you know I pack a chain saw I'll skin your ass raw And if my day keeps goin' this way I just might break somethin' tonight... I hope you know I pack a chain saw I'll skin your ass raw And if my day keeps goin' this way I just might break somethin' tonight... I hope you know I pack a chain saw I'll skin your ass raw And if my day keeps goin' this way I just might break your fuckin' face tonight! Give me somethin' to break How bout your fuckin' face I hope you know I pack a chain saw, what!...  [chorus]   Mmm.  It hasn't adversely affected my mood in the slightest; if anything, I'm feeling a little more goofy and gregarious with only a tiny bit of snarky thrown in for balance.  I wish all my friends such an experience.  Happy Monday!

       Sometimes things are more than what they seem to be.  This afternoon, for instance, was ostensibly about shopping.  It quickly showed itself to be more than that, though, as T was feeling "solar powered" from the amazing weather and I rebounded from an early-morning headache that was shocking enough to wake me from a deep sleep and impel me toward the  urlLink Imitrex .  We were both pretty spunky when we arrived at Geneva Commons.  An hour and a half later when we left the first store we'd entered-- urlLink Victoria's Secret --we were looking somewhat bedraggled and sullen.  Not because we'd been unsuccessful in our quest for purchases (far from it!) but because  I have never in my life tried on so many items of clothing in such a short period of time .  It was completely insane.  T bought a couple of things that she'd been looking for and managed to keep relatively within her budget ballpark.  I went completely out of character wild.  Things I needed, things I wanted, and things I let the salespeople talk me into.  It was so much fun, but totally crazy.  The bag is actually  heavy .  Now that I've pulled it out of the bag I'm thinking that maybe I went a little overboard, but I think I'll wear all of it.  Hmm...    After VS we headed to  urlLink Ann Taylor .  Not the kind of store at which I shop, although I struggled for the right word to explain my problem with it.  T found several skirts, dresses and blouses to try on.  Liked a pair of sandals but at $100+ they were beyond silly for the length of time one could use them in the Illinois summer.  She ended up buying a skirt, a tiny sweater shell, and trouser socks.  Practical but not boring.  And as we left the store, the word that I'd been seeking came to me: precious.  The place is too damned precious for me.  My shoulders aren't microscopic and I don't like clothes that look like they were designed for infants.  She was surprisingly not insulted by what I said, but I think that's in part because she thinks that I dress like an idiot.  (We're not all that much alike in that regard.)    We dropped the bags in the car and hopped off to Barnes & Noble for a snack.  Tired feet already.  Although we hadn't planned to buy anything, I couldn't get out without indulging in something I wouldn't usually get--  every  Better Than Ezra CD that I hadn't owned before.  Yup, I got:  urlLink Deluxe ;  urlLink Friction, Baby ; and  urlLink How Does Your Garden Grow? --all at once.  It was partially the "I've already spent a ton of money so what difference will this make?" and partially the "I want it  now " impatience and fun of shopping that did me in.  Not that I don't love them already;  How Does Your Garden Grow?  just ended and I'm popping in  Friction, Baby  now.  Moving on:  urlLink J. Jill .  I had no real idea that I'd find anything there because I've secretly thought of that store as being the female version of J.Crew--kind of, er, irritatingly preppy and "crisp".  But I've asked T to influence my wardrobe more, so we went in and she showed me some things that she thought I should wear.  I tried a few shirts: one was hilariously tight, one wasn't bad but perhaps a little more opaque than I'm looking for, and one was just right (thanks, Goldy).  I just checked the website and none of them are pictured (dammit) but they do have the  urlLink anklet  that I picked up at the last minute.  T got another skirt--a gorgeous raspberry with an overskirt of white embroidered sheer--and a very cute pink cross-over knit shirt.  As we hobbled to the car we realized that we should've worn different shoes were both too tired and sore to continue.  A pathetic display of weakness, but we're out of practice.    Stopped at Target Greatland on the way out of town.  Nothing exciting there, but we each managed to spend a bit anyway.  Then we took an unexpected jaunt through the outskirts of...the outskirts.  Quite an indirect route, actually, but home with no trouble.    Now I'm doing laundry and contemplating a late dinner.  What an excellent day.

       I know I've been harping on the weather lately, but after the wettest May on record for Northern Illinois, all this sunshine is making a significant impact on my mood.  It's unbelievably beautiful outside right now--68°, sunny, a tiny breeze, cloudless sky--and I woke up early on purpose, on a Saturday of all days, just because it seemed wrong to stay in bed and miss it.  That's completely our of character for me.  My parents would be thrilled that their slacker daughter seems to finally be conforming to their "early to rise" mentality.  It'll all fall apart once it starts getting humid & gross, though, as Illinois always does in the summertime.  The long-awaited shopping extravaganza is occurring this afternoon.  T & I will trundle ourselves off to Geneva Commons, one of those "it wasn't there 6 months ago but now I can't find a parking space" faux-small town-looking shopping explosions.  (It's not a strip mall, godforbid, but stores that are connected...and a huge parking lot...and lots of them are chain stores...but it's all upscale and obnoxious so that soothes the anti-mall outrage of the suburbanites who moved away from the 'burbs because they didn't want the congestion and they did want that small-town feel.)  It's not the ideal trip and it's not the ideal day, because I have a long list of things that I want and she's buying little if anything, and we've only a few hours in which to maneuver for parking spaces around the soccer mommies in their Hummers making assignations with their gardener/pool boy/lovers on their Blackberries....    [Yeah, women who write are too creative sometimes.]  I think I've mentioned my bathroom renovation in passing once or twice.  It's nearly finished so here are more details.  The walls are dark; the color is by Olympic and is called  urlLink Blue Fjord .  The fixtures are bone, so the ceiling paint is also Bone, and the carpeting will be something close to that.  (The room is absolutely minute and I'm leaving the carpet to the last choice because it can be a remnant and still be good quality.)  The towel bars and all other metal pieces are brushed nickel.  The medicine cabinet and all other wooden items are mahogany.  It should be finished by Sunday (?) and as soon as the before and after photos are developed I'll post them.    Time to get ready.  Bon weekend, y'all!

       It's another gorgeous early summer day in Illinois.  Hard to believe and particularly precious after so many weeks of dark and rain.  No matter how good it looks, though, it'll never look as good to me--or feel as good to me--as Miami did.  I'm starting to wonder if I'm a warm-weather girl at heart.  This is the first view I had of the Atlantic Ocean, after T and I had walked across the beach.  (The cruise ship offers visual perspective but was definitely  not  the point of the photograph.)   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Another shot of the ocean.  The colors of sky and water blew me away after the dull Midwestern winter.    urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     This shows some of the Miami Beach skyline, much of which is multi-colored in pastel shades.  It's rather garish and funky and takes some getting used to, but overall I thought it was aesthetically appealing, particularly with the almost unreal blue of the sky behind.    urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Proof that  we  were there--that's T on the left (in jeans) and me (so  pale! ) on the right.    urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Another self-portrait, this one entitled "Legs Sans Seaweed Immediately Before Tide Came In."    urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    I want to go back.

       * Shaving the other morning with a new brand of razor, the  urlLink Bic "Soleil" .  It has moisturizing strips.  It was the second use of that particular razor, so the strips had been wet when it was stored.  I applied shaving cream, which is actually  urlLink Aveeno  Positively Smooth Shave Gel--which smells like oatmeal cookies, and if you haven't experienced it first-hand you should go to Target, grab a can from the shelf, pull off the top and smell it.  No need to spray it, just sniff.  Anyway, once the area was slathered in cream I drew the razor over it and the moisturizing strip, gooey from being capped wet, mixed with the shave gel, ending up looking and smelling  exactly like Marshmallow Creme !  It was so cool.  Of course I was laughing my ass off and ended up slicing off a chunk of my arm, but it was worth it.  Shaving with Marshmallow Creme!  Too funny.  * My high school band director is retiring and I'm tempted to go to the retirement party.  * It's a fucking gorgeous day.  68° and sunny.

       "When you're curious, you find lots of interesting things to do." -- Walt Disney   Onesome: When you're curious -  Is there a specific subject you're especially curious about? A person? A region of the world? An animal? A field of study?  I'm responding to this fresh, without having read the questions or anyone else's answers, so this is making me laugh really hard.  OK.  I'll try to be serious.  Hmm.  A specific subject I'm curious about.  Choosing to answer this from an intellectual, academic standpoint, I'll say--Philosophy, particularly Utilitarianism.  A specific person I'm curious about?  Well, I have made a new friend recently, someone with whom I've got a surprising amount in common (besides the obvious - we're both lawyers)....  It's been a long time since I've had someone to talk to about law & stuff.  But the better (?) answer would be Wilhelm Canaris, a Nazi executed for his role in the plot to assassinate Hitler.  A region of the world--that's easy: Ireland.  An animal?  I've always liked squirrels.  Field of study?  I think I might need to start work on another degree soon.  Maybe English.    Twosome: you find lots of interesting -  What do you consider your most interesting trait/ feature?    Modesty?  Nah.  Willingness--to learn, to see.    Threesome: things to do -  What's on your list of things to do everyday, whether you want to or not? Filing, phone calls, homework, chasing around after kiddos, cooking, cleaning, etc.    I've several lists, but I'm not ruled by them.  If this question seeks an answer for "What do I do each day that I don't particularly enjoy?", the answer would be that I get out of bed too early, I wear grown-up clothes, I make nice with people all day when what I really want is to close the door and turn up the CD player, and I manage to do it all without seeming too crazy.  If the point is a literal  list , mine are more long-term and vague, perhaps by design.

       I gave an erroneous impression yesterday.  My thoughts about elephants recently have been, for all intents and purposes, positive.  The initial analogy was in regard to a very close, very important friend with whom I argued last week.  But our friendship will live a long time, despite our occasional bickering.  (Elephants live a long time.)  And we can survive taking things out on each other (or even taking things out  about  each other) because we're both strong.  (Elephants have tough skin.)  And I'm going to do my best to not forget where my priorities lie.  (Elephants never forget.)  It's not exactly a mnemonic - call it a mantra of a friendship.

       Not with Jacob Slichter (although he is certainly appealing) but with his book,  urlLink So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star: How I Machine-Gunned a Roomful of Record Executives and Other True Tales from a Drummer's Life .  This is the best modern memoir I've read, and one of the best books I've seen in a very long time.  Slichter is the drummer from the band  urlLink Semisonic , formed in Minneapolis in the early 1990s.  If you know me at all, you know that Minnesotan-ness is a major factor of the way that I conceive of myself.  That similarity probably gave Semisonic a boost in my estimation, and also encouraged me to pick this book out of the dozens that appeal to me at any one time.  I've also, as some may know, always had a soft spot for drummers.  My history with the opposite sex is a jumble of disastrous encounters: J. Aaron Baudhuin, Eric Engrav, Jim Grote (those jeans!), Adam Zanzig, Steve Voshell....  Most of them were, alas, unrequited (although someday I may tell the whole Aaron story--suffice it to say, I was vindicated), but my love for the art of drumming lived on.    Slichter is not what the stereotypical drummer, at least not by the experiences I've had with that type.  He's introspective, thoughtful, overwhelmingly intelligent, riddled with doubt, responsible, and financially tortured.  At the same time, though, he's cocky, brilliantly funny, impatient, unconsciously sexy, impulsive, obsessed with appearance, and seemingly uncomfortable with the role that requires him to be behind the "important" action--just like every other drummer I've known.  The combination makes his memoir fascinating and the personal life that he reveals simultaneously appealing and painful.  This is a guy you'd like to have come over to your house so you could feed him and make sure he's got a warm-enough sweater.    There are several things from the book that I'd like to quote here so that you can see exactly why I liked this so much.  I'll try to leave some of it to your imagination, but here are some of my favorites.   "The idea of playing an acoustic guitar, a bass with a tiny amplifier, and a pair of bongos for a bunch of suits seated around a table sounded vaguely like having sex in front of ones parents."  (p. 60)  "How to dress myself continued to be a vexing issue.  I remained wary of following [Semisonic bandmates'] Dan and Johns forays into flamboyance but knew that my clothes should say, 'rock star.'  If only they could say, 'Thoughtful rock star, skeptical of stardom and fashion, who nevertheless manages to dress with an unassuming panache.'"  (p. 156)  "Over the course of the set, I build the groove into a wave where I can surf.  I like to lie back where the top of the wave curls over me--the pocket.  On my best nights, I am lord of the pocket, the wave, and the ocean.  With a large spacious fill, the wave becomes fifty feet high, and I glide along the top, enjoying the ride as I send it crashing down, a rush for the audience.  At other moments, I still the water and skim over its glassy smoothness.  Drumming is a game: Make the audience shimmy and shake, then knock them over.  Give Dan and John a surprise kick in the ass.  They love it.  The ten-year-old boy and his father [in the audience] love it, too."  (p. 197)  "The most intense questions...came from the German interviewers. 	"'Can hope overcome despair in the real world, as it does on your records?' 	"'In what ways can music change the world?' 	"'Why are you so afraid to write a political song?' 	"...A few of the European journalists spoke flawless English.  Others spoke no English, requiring our label hosts to function as interpreters.  The majority spoke functional Englishone or two verb tenses and confused syntax.  'But I think you are writing some pop songs always.  But for your next album, too?' 	"We answered, 'But this is exactly what is not on our minds.  We are not thinking to make our next record yet.'  Immersion is a powerful teacher."  (p. 231)  "During our fourth song, a softer mid-tempo number titled 'DND' (for 'Do Not Disturb'), hundreds of people hauled out lighters and flicked them on and off with the backbeats, as if my left drumstick were literally lighting up the room with each smack of the snare drum.  I laughed in amazement, nearly falling off the drum throne."  (pp. 240-1)  [at a banquet] "I...felt my stock bottom out when R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe breezed through the affair briefly to confer with the two Radiohead lads, perhaps arranging a later rendezvous far removed from the schmoozeoisie."  (pp. 263-4)  Slichter writes with a real person's voice about something no regular "real person" has experienced.  His story is wistful and sometimes bitter, but also funny and pure--a 10.  I   loved   it.

Or is there a crafty hobby you'd like to take up if had the time and/or money to do so?  I don't think I'm crafty, at least not in the typical sense.

       The top 9 (ok, so there were only 9) sets of crazy search terms used to find the blog in the past few days, in no particular order:   1.  Hooters girls Jenica   2.  oddly shaped thumbs   3.  "top 10 annoying responses"  - as a phrase  4.  girls high school shorts so short   5.  shoes eastlands weird  -  what the fuck?!   6.  "bacon is a sexual nightlight, of sorts"  - as a phrase  7.  smallest type of plane that lands regularly at Heathrow   8.  fuzzy butterfly chair   9.  bacon eroticism    The bacon thing is starting to creep me out.  Truly.   A personal request to the Eastlands person: send me an email and let me know what your  deal  is with the bleeping shoes.    Tomorrow's a special day for someone who means everything to me. It's hard to know what to do about it, wanting to make it as good as possible without going overboard (as I'm prone to doing). It's complicated by our schedules (pulling us in different directions), personal upheaval, the grant application I'm scrambling to finish before Thursday, financial issues, and a dozen more things that can't even be put into words. The best thing that I can do for now is to say all I can say in this place:  I wish you happy, I love you, and whatever you want, tomorrow or ever, I'll give or do.    Things will be quiet until the grant's written.  No worries.

       It was 58° when I left for work this morning.  It is  July .  Even now, at 3:30, it's only 70°.  I don't understand.  My feet are freezing (although my blue toenails-- urlLink OPI 'Cool by the Pool' --are strangely appropriate).  Today is unequivocally  one of those days .  A day where the non-ringing phone sounds particularly quiet.  (The context isn't missed nearly as much as the contact.)  Where the empty inbox seems fraught with meaning.  Where the migraine that began as a slight pinging behind my right eye is now a dozen maniacal tribesmen with bongos, pleading with their gods for rain and fertility and good crops, all at once.  The clock is moving backward rather than merely standing still.  How can it be only 3:35?  I'm listening to my new CD,  urlLink Give Up  by The Postal Service.  It's working its way into my brain like a parasite, but in a good way.  !    I had lunch with an old, peculiar friend.  We were both late, although he was quite a bit more late than I was.  I'd given him about 3 minutes before I'd have gotten something to go and ditched him altogether.  Things in his life are looking very positive right now and it was good to see him so happy.  Of course, considering the source it was impossible for him to entirely see the bright side.  (The glass isn't just half-empty, but there's a crack in it and it's slightly dirty, too.)  He's "just a total sweetheart."  Three little quotations--little chapter decorations--from  urlLink The Reluctant Metrosexual  by Peter Hyman.  They caught my eye while I cataloged the book so I thought I'd include them.   "There can be no injury, where there is no property." John Locke  "Having nothing, nothing can he lose." Shakespeare  "No I never got over those blue eyes I see them everywhere." Johnny Cash   Next Sunday is my parents' 40th wedding anniversary.  It's also my niece's 17th birthday.  She'll be the same age that I was when she was born.  That's huge for me--momentous.  Is there any way to impart to her, as the only one of her generation on my side of the family, what she has meant to me for these 17 years?  Every other child I have ever known, or have ever even heard of, is compared to her, or my experience with her, in some way.  If I tell her that, will she understand it?  Or prehaps she will (as she often does) simply look at me with that prescient, all-too-knowing face that's too much like mine and say, in a voice too much like mine, too: "Yah.  I know."

       ~ "'If God didn't want us to eat animals,  how come He made 'em out of meat?' (Seen on a bumper sticker, just outside Detroit)"  That's in  urlLink Vamped  by David Sosnowski.  I saw it yesterday while cataloging and it made me laugh out loud.  Apologies to vegetarians.  ~ Drove to work this morning behind a DK County Sheriff's Dept. car.  Naturally, we were driving 5-10 mph below the speed limit because anyone directly in front of him thought it was a speed test.  I was 10 min. late before I even left the house, so I tried to remain copasetic about the situation.  Once we finally lost the losers in front of the cop car, he sped up to 10-15 mph over the speed limit, and retained that ratio all the way to the library (the county bldg. is just beyond).  He had no problem with me following him through town, a 25 mph zone, at 40-45 mph.  It was excellent.  Well, other than when both of us nearly rear-ended a guy in a white SUV who was plunked in the middle of our lane waiting to turn into the local police station parking lot.  When I realized what was going on (and when I'd extricated myself from the steering wheel after my quick stop, during which I nearly did a wheelie), I laughed so hard that tears came to my eyes.  You've just got to love the irony.  ~ Found an absolutely bitchin' job posting last night.  The University of Michigan Law Library is looking for a Head of Technical Services.  I'm not quite qualified (sigh, I lack the MLS), but it does start at $75,000.  Imagine doing what I do, making $75K.  What a fucking joke.    I actually went to the point of looking at the UM website, to see the intricacies of the job itself.  They have another position offered, for a Foreign & Comparative Law Reference Librarian.  That requires both an MLS and a JD and the salary's not posted, but it sounds particularly sweet.  It made me wonder if there's a place in academia for me after all.  ~ But then again, I'd have to dress like an adult more often than not, and I'm really comfortable today in my scruffy linen camp shirt, jeans (hanging off my hips, which are nearing their college size) and Birkies.  And my newly lemon (or  le mon , depending on your nationality and ability to type) hair.  My toes are  urlLink Sephora  #148 (a sort of magenta with a barely bluish tint).  Unpolished fingers.  New thumb ring--more about that later this weekend, if time permits.   ~ Speaking of time, I'm out of it.    Bon weekend.

How about directions to that one restaurant? ...or maybe it's people's names? What is it you call for assistance on?  I have a serious brain cramp with spelling "history"--I often put the "s" before the "h".  One person used to scold me about putting my ending punctuation outside of my quotation marks, but that's an affectation (or just for emphasis) rather than a true error.  And I can do it with impunity now that there's no angel (?) on my shoulder. Ah, there is one thing that drives me crazy in this area: a light switch at my parents' house.  At least once each time that I visit I'll switch it off thinking that it's the dining room light.  It's not the dining room light--it's a switched outlet, and it just happens to be the one with the main computer on it.  It causes all hell to break loose when it turns off, and almost invariably startles the crap out of me.  Whichever parent is currently playing Free Cell is none too pleased, either.   Threesome: go wrong... --  ..and the big finish: what was the last thing you had go so gloriously wrong that all you could do was just stare in awe at the aftermath? I mean, come on, you can tell us [g]...  I'm not in the best position to answer this question at the moment.  I'll take the dodge of the ungodly Cataloging Meeting and fallout that I already recounted  urlLink here .  Nearly dying in a fiery crash on Cherry Valley Road because I momentarily 'forgot how to drive' seems pretty spectacularly boneheaded.

       While wandering campus last Saturday photographing big things, my attention was drawn to a very small thing that seemed worthy of closer study.  This was the first metallic-looking bug that I've seen.  It was both creepy and fascinating.      urlLink       I realize that this is out of focus, at least that the bug itself is blurred.  But the rock upon which he stands is crystallized, and the blur of the foreground brings out that texture to a greater extent.    urlLink

       I've been listening to Jenica's 'Dodgeball' mix again.  It is...how shall I say it?...a bit harsh.  Complex, yet raw.  Wrenching but heartfelt.  It played in the car on my way to work, again while I drove to the vet's office to buy catfood and to Target to pick up a prescription at lunch, a third time on the way to an appointment, and finally as I made my way through the annoying, nearly suburb-like traffic toward home.   urlLink I've previously waxed melancholic  on the merits of   Break Stuff   by Limp Bizkit.   (It's just one of those days Feelin' like a freight train First one to complain Leaves with a blood stain Damn right I'm a maniac You better watch your back 'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program And if you're stuck up You just lucked up Next in line to get fucked up Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker It's just one of those days!   ...I feel like shit My suggestion is to keep your distance  'Cause right now I'm dangerous We've all felt like shit And been treated like shit All those motherfuckers that want to step up I hope you know I pack a chain saw I'll skin your ass raw...)   And more recently,  urlLink I quoted a bit  from   Control   by Puddle of Mudd.     (I can't control you You can't control me I need to feel you so why's there even you and me?  I love the way you rake my skin I feel the hate you place inside I need to get your voice out of my head Cause I'm that guy you'll never find)   Today's repeat was   Last Resort   by Papa Roach.    Cut my life into pieces  This is my last resort  Suffocation, no breathing  Don't give a fuck  If I cut my arm bleeding   This is my last resort  ...I never realized  I was spread too thin  Til it was too late  And I was empty within  Hungry feeding on chaos and living in sin    Why bring this up?  It's because I had the volume absolutely  cranked , and I was singing (to the extent that one "sings" this sort of thing), and I was sort of seat-dancing (but not in a Mingles kind of way, which anyone from Winona will understand is  not  a good thing).  Anytime I pulled up next to someone I got the look of revulsion--or the look of, "Hmm, aren't  you  the interesting character?", depending on the age and gender of the person looking.  I'm sure that my plaid linen J.Crew shirt and Oakleys had something to do with the incongruousness of the picture.  (The PB&J hovering near my mouth during the lunchtime segment of this probably made for a strange overall look, too.)  So I was singing, see.  That's the key to this.  I was singing: "Next in line to get fucked up Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker", and  "I think you know all of the rules there's no expressions on your face I'm hope that some day you will let me go Release me from my dirty cage", and   "Suffocation, no breathing  Don't give a fuck  If I cut my arm bleeding"...  and I realized, I sound like a complete idiot when I swear.  I mean, totally foolish.  It's more or less bad depending on what I'm saying, the absolute low point being "motherfucker," which out of my mouth sounds entirely absurd.  Some people have it and some people don't, and I so clearly don't.  Friends, it was a watershed moment for me.  Don't expect miracles within days, and don't expect any diminution of the execrable language in my writing, because if that's the only way it's coming out, it'll probably increase.  But if I sound as irredeemably stupid to anyone else as I did to myself today, I can only thank you for your patience while I figured out this one for myself.  Peace.

       First, the treat: if you've a decent connection, check out  urlLink jibjab 's oddly adorable commentary on the presidential campaign.  And now, some photos from Saturday.  The local university seems to have a policy, whether official or unofficial, promoting outdoor art.  Sometimes it's comprehensible by lower mortals like me, and sometimes it's just...weird.  An example of  weird  is the following.   They call it   urlLink      At first glance, it looks like a chunk of bleachers or half of a staircase:   urlLink      The blue of the steps and rail didn't show very well against the gorgeous blue of the sky.   urlLink       A nearby tree offered increased contrast.   urlLink      Although rather flimsy, this chunk of art is obviously intended to be climbed; each of the stairs has a plate affixed with a philosophical (?) word on it.      urlLink       I don't know what it means.  Prehaps I shouldn't scoff, since I can't imagine putting together something huge and conceptual.  But really, this seems terribly goofy.

       Wandered around the area on Saturday with friends from the big city.&nbsp; Took  lots  of pictures, some of which are worth sharing.&nbsp; I'll do so in several installments over the course of the week rather than bombarding y'all with dozens of photos at once.&nbsp; Today's topic is the flora near a stream on the campus of my  alma mater  (law school version).&nbsp;     urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink      That last was an attempt to see the flower not as the focus of the photo, literally, but as only one element of the composition.  The original is huge (2272 x 1704 pixels) so it's not likely to translate very well to a smaller format.  If you have a feeling about it, let me know what you think.

       How small is this world, anyway?  I'll tell you: I posted my reviewlet of those 3 blogging books this morning, really thinking very little about it because there were a million other things that I needed to do today.  Just wanted to (a) divert some of the [self-imposed] pressure re:  Getting Things Done , (b) entertain, and (c) provide my faithful readers (helloo, all 7 or so of y'all) with valuable information.    I cannot even express how thrilled I am to have found out that none other than the Genius himself,  urlLink Biz Stone , discovered my review--and it apparently pleased him.  He posted a link to this blog on  urlLink www.furl.net , which is an online storage site that's really quite fascinating.  I hadn't known about it until I uncovered the links to the blog, but I've been ferreting through it for an hour and have found that it's incredible.  Of course, like everything else online it could be an immense time-waster, too.  I'm going to stop writing now, sit back and bask in this unanticipated but lovely aw-shucksy feeling.   The  Biz Stone read  my  blog.   Wow.

       I feel like a schmuck, but I finally have to admit it: I gave in on a book that I was reading.&nbsp; It sucks, because I was inspired to read it and parts of it were interesting and enlightening, and I really wanted to get something meaningful out of it, both for the sake of the purpose of the book and so that I could really cement my connection with the person who suggested it to me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The only explanation that I can give is that it's just too much to deal with at this point.&nbsp; That sounds ridiculous in a way given the topic of the book and what it could mean to me, but sometimes even something is too much.&nbsp; And I know that the person who recommended it wasn't saying that it was guaranteed to work [generically], or even that&nbsp;it was all that likely to work for me.&nbsp; But I just&nbsp;so  wanted &nbsp; it to work, and   immediately  .&nbsp; Prehaps that was my problem?&nbsp; A marked lack of patience for letting the process occur naturally?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There were two unforgettable things&nbsp;in the book (OK, two things that I got out of the 2 chapters that I  did  read).&nbsp; First, the concept of "swing"--in rowing, the athlete's idea of  zone  is referred to as "swing", where you let the boat do what the boat does and just stay out of its way.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;struggle and make a huge effort&nbsp;to make the boat go fast, you get in the boat's way and end up working at cross-purposes and you go slower and actually have to work harder to do it.&nbsp; But if you swing, you're working with the boat, with the current, with with with with... and it happens because all of those elements  want  it to happen.&nbsp; How excellent would it be to achieve swing in one's own life?  &nbsp;  And the other thing that I got out of that book?&nbsp; Lacerations and contusions.&nbsp; It was narcolepsy on paper!&nbsp; I have made it through several years of advanced education in some subjects that are fucking dull without falling asleep while reading.&nbsp; How could I have read an entire year of Torts and stayed awake throughout, but not managed to remain conscious through even a section, much less a chapter, of this book?&nbsp; I can't fathom it.&nbsp; I literally did not read this book even once without falling asleep.&nbsp; I had it checked out from another library since May.&nbsp; I renewed it so many times that I eventually couldn't do it anymore in my capacity as "patron"--I had to do it at work from the admin. side.&nbsp; I waived two overdue fines.&nbsp; Overdues!&nbsp; ME!&nbsp; And finally I just had to return it because it felt like it was taunting me.&nbsp; "Think you're so smart, so on top of things, prissy bitch?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; You can't even read me!"&nbsp; OK, it wasn't really that bad, but the thing annoyed me so much that I had to make it go away.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I will read it.&nbsp; Someday.&nbsp; I swear--I can't let a book get the last laugh.  &nbsp;  So.&nbsp; My review of  urlLink Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity &nbsp;by  urlLink David Allen &nbsp;is rather incomplete, but pretty much heartfelt.&nbsp; I hope to link back to this post someday with&nbsp;a second and final version of my review, having read the whole thing.  &nbsp;  I'll add this last paragraph as a sort of balm to my ego.&nbsp; I recently (while planning the new blog template) read three blogging books.&nbsp; I didn't review them because I hadn't read every word of each one, and I think that my reviews do imply that the target books have been read thoroughly.&nbsp; However, I think it's worthwhile to share what I got out of them.&nbsp;  urlLink The weblog handbook : practical advice on creating and maintaining your blog &nbsp;by  urlLink Rebecca Blood  provided a great deal of background information on the history of blogging, the culture of bloggers, and the etiquette and appropriateness of blog behavior.&nbsp;  urlLink We blog : publishing online with Weblogs  by  urlLink Paul Bausch ,  urlLink Matthew Haughey , and&nbsp; urlLink Meg Hourihan &nbsp;is more practical and less textbook sociological, offering a reasonable amount of HTML assistance intermingled with what could almost be termed a defense of the blog culture.&nbsp; Finally,  urlLink Blogging : genius strategies for instant Web content &nbsp;by  urlLink Biz Stone  brought it all together.&nbsp; It was exactly what I'd been looking for when I picked up the three books, and I wish I'd started with it rather than reading it last.&nbsp; Yes, it included the history and meaning of blogging.&nbsp; And it was chock full of cautions against the nasty stuff that people do on their blogs without thinking about it first (tons of which I've done and later regretted it--why doesn't anyone tell you that stuff  before  you start, rather than when you're simply looking to change your template?!)&nbsp; But what makes this book invaluable is that it gives, in the most idiot-friendly manner, absolutely complicated, cool, totally-customizable formatting advice that  anyone  could follow.&nbsp; HTML  and  CSS.&nbsp;  And  an explanation of why each is valuable at different times, in different ways, for different people.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So.&nbsp; If you want to learn more about why you're blogging, or if you want to do it better, or if you already know a lot but want to know more, Stone's book will help.&nbsp; And it's damned funny, too.&nbsp; Highly recommended.&nbsp; (The others are at least a Recommend, but if you buy Stone, I'd just check the others out from your local library.)

         ::State Fair and Rodeo::     Onesome- State:   What state (or territory) do you live in? Have you lived in any other(s)? Where would you like to live? And as a bonus: Any idea what year your state became a state? *grin*  I live in Illinois, and a perpetual state of flux.  I've lived in two other states, both of which begin with the letters "Mi".  Where would I like to live?  Home, I suppose.  That's an extremely big question at this point, and I'm not sure I want to think about it.   I do not know what year this state became a state, but I know when my home state did--1858.     Twosome- Fair:   Or amusement parks: Did you enjoy them as a kid? What was your favorite ride? How do you feel about them now? Ready to go wander around one again, sampling funnel cakes and corn dogs and riding rides until you're sick or would you rather just enjoy the entertainment or stay home and avoid the crowds?  Didn't do the amusement park thing until I was 17 and went to Opryland on a band trip.  I'd just begun dating Blake and really didn't want to be away from him, so I was in a horrible mood the entire time.  My good friend Joel was charming and sweet while we were at the Park, trying to cheer me up and keep my mind off the Boy and the various things about him that I was missing so much.  They had a photographer stationed at the entrance to the park, taking pictures of people as they came in that they could buy in tiny kaleidoscope-like things.  The one of Joel and me is one of the best pictures I've ever seen--I look pensive and sad but am smiling crookedly through it, while Joel is absolutely  beaming  with that whole-face grin that he had.  I wonder if he's still that happy?  I hope that he is.   Our hair was very similar, although mine was much longer.  Punkish, floopy bangs with more down the left side.  His was spiked up all over, mine hung a bit in the front and curled wildly down my back.  He had probably 6-8 inches on me in height at that time even though he was 2 years younger.    Back to the amusement park itself.  We went on only a couple of rides.  Something like the Flume at Valley Fair (in one of those Mi-- states) in which we were soaked to the skin from the waist up.  Probably a Tilt-a-Whirl.  Certainly Bumper cars, if they had them, because anything that I can do to literally take out aggression on other people in a socially-sanctioned way, I'll do.  I really haven't ever liked rides.  That sense of being totally out of control--yuck.    The thing that I recall most clearly about that day, apart from spending the time with a really good friend, was having the  best  caricature done.  It was utter perfection, the perfect salve to my wounded heart (wounded from being forcibly ripped away from the love of my life, of course.  That makes me laugh now, a little sadly and sarcastically, because the blog often gets hit with Google searches by Blake's name.  Who's looking for him?  Is he in even more trouble than I've heard?)  It was on white paper, just a black ink sketch of me looking rather wistful, but with beautiful intensely blue eyes.  The only color was my eyes.  Why does that resonate so much right now, so much that I'm even squirming a bit to admit it?  An odd mix of uncomfortable vanity and too much honesty, prehaps.    I don't know where the caricature is now.  Did I give it away?  I think it may have been a Christmas or birthday gift to Andy that year, a pathetic attempt toward compensation for the silver and turquoise bracelet that he brought back from Mexico for me.  It may have been lost in a move somewhere.  Funny that I can't remember its end, when the beginning is so clear.     Threesome- And Rodeo:   Have you ever been to or watched a rodeo on TV? Did you enjoy it or consider it a barbaric spectacle? If you liked it, what was your favorite event? Ever tempted to race barrels or ride a bull yourself?  Ugh.  Rodeo?  Blegh.  Never been, never watched, never would.  Barbaric, boring, horrid.  And smelly.

       ~ An individual came into the library yesterday to pay on an overdue notice.  Actually it was a lost book.  Not so rare, really, except that the book was due on 10th February  1998 .  The book's been lost for 6 years, 5 months, 4 days!  The bill  went to collections  on 6th May 1998!  What could have spurred the desire to pay after all this time?  So weird.  ~ A different individual wanders about the library this morning.  Long hair in a very loose knot at the back of her head, many tendrils dropping out.  Athletic t-shirt.  Baggy knit pants.  Very obviously not wearing anything under the above-mentioned clothing.  When I casually spotted her from a distance of about...30 yards? my knee-jerk thought was, "jbf".  Remember those girls in college who you'd see walking home in the morning wearing a guy's t-shirt, sometimes even carrying a pillow, hair mussed up but still in half of a going-out up-do?  Yawning and half grumpy/half, er, sedate looking?  We used to call that the "jbf" look.  I don't know how much of this I need to spell out.  I guess I could say that the first word is just.  And the second is been.  Surprised?  I doubt it.    I'm having one of those "today is the first day of the rest of your life" feelings.  Perhaps it's just because everything's been so up in the air, or upside down, lately.  But the weather's good (low 70s, bright sun and no clouds at all--a huge improvement on yesterday's strong storms that produced tornadoes in mid-Illinois and in Wisconsin near KR and fam, about whom I've been thinking a lot lately), I had no email other than my usual machine-generated stuff (comics, bloggish nonsense), I'm getting a great deal of work accomplished, one of my more enjoyable coworkers is here, the prospect of spending a quiet and companionable evening with T exists, and someone sent a long, rambling message yesterday that very much complements a long, rambling message that some Anonymous-type person sent a week or so ago.  Reminding me that there's more to think about than the negative, certainly, but also that actions have consequences.  Maybe it's just one of those times where reflection, rather than action, is in order.  Time to whittle away at the heaps of work.  For the first time in a while, though, they're not bringing me down.  They're just there.   Mind like water.   Think I can get there?

        The anklet (i.e. ankle bracelet) that I got from  urlLink J.Jill  while shopping with T and the toe ring that just arrived from  urlLink SilverMoon Jewelry  via  urlLink Amazon :   urlLink     The most obnoxious piece of jewelry I can imagine owning!  An unbelievably annoying girl (child, really) wore one of these  to the bar exam  the year that I took it.  She wore it for, oh, about 3 minutes (jingling all the while like a demented little fucking freakette--who did she think she was?!) before her nearest neighbor alerted the proctor to her crime and had it (the anklet, not the freaklet) removed.  Over the passage of time (has it really been  five years  since I took that goddamned test??) the sharpness of the memory has waned and been replaced with the sort of piquancy that makes one...want an anklet with bells on it.  Ergo, the  urlLink Sabrina Silver  anklet (also via  urlLink Amazon ):    urlLink     Finally, a reality check, showing my actual feet, next to each other, artfully displaying my rolled-up jeans and the mirror-image creases from the sandals I'd been wearing not more than 5 minutes prior:   urlLink      I realize that this post does not answer the immortal question that was the substance of a recent search engine query that found this blog-- "what is the meaning of wearing a thumb ring?"   That will have to wait for a week or so.  Perhaps in the intervening time, the questor can learn new search techniques.  I believe that  urlLink JPR  has  urlLink posted  on that  urlLink subject   urlLink several times .  [Incidentally, these photos were taken in the ultra-luxe surrounds of the staff "lounge" (read those quotation marks in the most ironical manner possible, please) at the library.  Hence the lovely carpeting and sofa upholstery.  They clashed with my toe polish, didn't they?  For those who might be curious, it's  urlLink Creative Nail Design  #28, Burgundy Foil.]

       Just took an internet "IQ test".  Results:   The Classic IQ Test   Congratulations, Amy! Your IQ score is  131    This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others.   Your Intellectual Type is  Visionary Philosopher . This means you are highly intelligent and have a powerful mix of skills and insight that can be applied in a variety of different ways. Like Plato, your exceptional math and verbal skills make you very adept at explaining things to others — and at anticipating and predicting patterns. And that's just some of what we know about you from your IQ results.   It was challenging, and it's nice to have a numeric justification for sitting at my desk twiddling my thumbs for 10 minutes.   I'll upload the photos later this evening, probably while watching the All-Star Game.  (Go NL!)  Before anyone gets too frightened, they do not actually have anything to do with fetishism in any manner whatsoever.  Someone requested pictures of some jewelry that I recently acquired, including a toe ring and a couple of anklets.  Voila.  Sorry if I scared anyone with my earlier post.

       Listening to the Dodgeball Mix again on the way to work today.  These lyrics now pounding through my brain (albeit not at the same volume as they were in the car):     I can't control you You can't control me I need to feel you so why's there even you and me?  I love the way you rake my skin I feel the hate you place inside I need to get your voice out of my head Cause I'm that guy you'll never find     Time to drown myself in work.  But I did want to mention that I've some photos planned for later today.  Foot fetishist's dream....

       Background sounds:  Listening to the copier repairman (who looks like a repairman, complete with horn-rimmed glasses.  Who wears horn-rimmed glasses?!) beat the shit out of the copier.  Weather: Hotter than fucking blazes.  OK, according to weather.com, "77°F, feels like 80°F, Mostly Cloudy, Humidity: 78%."  What does that  really  feel like?  Sweat.  Like breathing it, seeing it, and particularly smelling it.  Blegh.  The good thing about it is that it makes staying inside and working a lot easier--no distraction.  I have some less-than-scintillating things on my To Do list for today and tomorrow.  Getting a start on a set of almost-overdue grant reporting forms.  Placing on-order records for 3 spreadsheets' worth of items that should arrive within the next couple of days.  Neverending goddamned processing.    At least I'm not across the street at the courthouse trying to weasel my way out of a jury.  I noticed at 2:00 that I hadn't yet gone to lunch.  How does that happen?  It's sort of creepy.    The Cubs played a really great game last night, the second half of the 9th inning notwithstanding.  I wonder if they'll be able to keep that momentum, considering that we're into the All-Star Break.  Speaking of the Break, I think it's excellent that  urlLink Carlos Zambrano  got the nod since he's one of my co-MVPs for the team for the first half.  However,  urlLink Aramis Ramirez  was  robbed --what more does a guy need than .326, 15 HR, and 56 RBI for the first half?!  It highlights the unfairness inherent in the system.  And even though I'm complaining about it, I'll still watch (and totally dig--'cause Chicks Dig the Long Ball) the  urlLink Home Run Derby  tonight.

       No jury duty tomorrow!  I called and the message said that all cases scheduled for tomorrow have been settled.  No news about what happens next, whether my panel's still available to the court or if we're completely excused.  I'm just happy to not have to be there tomorrow.  Spending a very quiet weekend catching up on some things that've gone undone for too long.  Relaxing, for one.  As I write I'm watching golf on TV, which I have always loved but this week seems particularly sweet.  I'll spare y'all the details but there's a tournament in Illinois that has significant implications for the  urlLink British Open  (played next week) and for the  urlLink Ryder Cup  (played in September near Detroit).  It's good to have something interesting but not personally compelling to think about when one's own stuff isn't playing out well at the moment.  The tournament's not usually so interesting because it's held in the middle of nowhere, at a course south of the  urlLink Quad Cities  (less than 100 miles from here, which tells you how close to nowhere I am!).  But I'm glad I stumbled on it while flipping channels.  I've been to a few PGA tournaments, mostly majors (and have tickets to the  urlLink PGA Championship  which is in Kohler, Wisconsin--near Sheboygan--this August), so the guys who are playing are more than just "people on TV"--they're guys I've  seen .  Real people.    Ach.  There's no point in going on about something that I know I'll either be teased about (since I know that most people just don't  get  televised golf) or that will be skipped over anyway.  I figured I should give a status report since I knew that my potential jury duty would be at the absolute  top  of everyone's list of interests this week, eh?  Yeah, right.

         ::Not so much easy as addicted...::     Onesome: Not so much --  --to do now that school is out for the students? ...or maybe a little too much to do for those student's parental units? What are you up to this July? Back for Summer Sessions? ...off to the beach? ...headed out on a weekend adventure? Surely you must be doing something!  I'm working  way  too much in July: trying to tie up several loose ends at the library, in the midst of some extra projects elsewhere, in the final thesis editing process (if a phone conference this evening goes as planned).  I'm hoping to be able to take some well-earned and much desired time away very soon.   Twosome: easy as --  Pie? Sure, how about your favorite pie? ...and hey, homemade versus store bought! Would you rather have Mom's Apple Pie or head on over to Marie C's for a slice of heaven there?  I'm not a huge fan of pie.  I know I'm going to be accused of anti-Americanism for that, but it's only because there are other things that I like better.  That being said, my mom makes a good apple pie.  And when I'm in the moment, Baker's Square's chocolate peanut butter is delicious.  However, there's no better pie than Frenchy.  [wink]   Threesome: addicted --  Okay, what is it you are addicted to, that element of your life you simply cannot do without. Reading? The Net? Little porcelain dolls? Oh, yeah: Money? Nah, make it something you'd spend your spare change on...

         You are the Moon card. Entering the Moon we enter the intuitive and psychic realms. This is the stuff dreams are made on. And like dreams the imagery we find here may inspire us or torment us. Understanding the moon requires looking within. Our own bodily rhythms are echoed in this luminary that circles the earth every month and reflects the sun in its progress. Listening to those rhythms may produce visions and lead you towards insight. The Moon is a force that has legends attached to it. It carries with it both romance and insanity. Moonlight reveals itself as an illusion and it is only those willing to work with the force of dreams that are able to withstand this reflective light.

       ~  urlLink Shape , July 2004, p. 24:  Go On, Get a Little Closer  "If you're feeling anxious, try sniffing the armpit of the nearest sweaty male.  OK, that might not be possible--or even desirable--but a study conducted at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia found that  women reported feeling more relaxed after six hours of regular exposure to male underarm secretions.   The effect is a response to men's pheromones, natural body chemicals that act as regulators of mood and influence female hormonal changes.  According to researchers, the ability to isolate active pheromones could lead to advancements in fertility and PMS treatments, providing yet another good reason to snuggle up." (LaVonne Taylor)  1. Is this why women who work in predominantly female environments (like, say, librarians) are often at least slightly peculiar? 2. Is it hard to maintain a relationship if one works at a Chemical Senses Center, particularly as a  scent researcher ? 3. What are they  truly  proposing?  I'm not sure that I like it, regardless.  ~ Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote (in  urlLink Wind, Sand, and Stars ), that "Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness."  Is that why I'm so happy with my thesis now?  Regardless, I think it's better than it's ever been.    ~ Read JPR's  urlLink commentary  this afternoon re: Illinois traffic.  It reminded me both that I really want to go out to NY to visit her sometime, and also that I wanted to write about speed tables.  For the uninitiated, speed tables are the Illinois (or maybe just local) equivalent of speed bumps, but overgrown and way more irritating.  They're probably 8 inches off the ground and 6 feet across.  There's one street that I use regularly that has them about every half-block or so.  Local legend is that a kid got squashed in traffic and the neighborhood caused enough uproar that the city council gave in on the speed tables.  My opinion: they're annoying, jarring, and utterly unfair.  The speed limit in that area is the same as it is in other areas.  The relative danger to children is the same.  There is no more traffic there than in lots of other places where kids spend time.  Why the unequal application of enforcement?  Simple: money.    My petty response: music.  Loud, thumpy bass, unrepentant.  As slow as possible.  Rich bastards.  ~ Speaking of bastards.  When I was in law school we were given a student directory each year, complete with photographs, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and other identifying information.  The books were known as "stalkers' guides."  Scary.    ~ I wasn't much of a "joiner" in law school.  Didn't do law review (fucking boys' club!) or any of those pseudo-mandatory If One Is To Be Successful groups.  Definitely didn't bother with the frat thing.  The one club that I did join: CLSLAW, pronounced "coleslaw."  The Canadian Law Students Association.  Dedicated to little more than drinking beer, talking about hockey, and saying, "Eh?" a lot.  Those were good times.  ~ Sometimes you can't escape something - wherever you look, it's right in front of you.  Like when I'm homesick, every book I find is about Minnesota.  Every song on the radio is by Prince or Dylan or Bob Mould.  I'm having one of those times right now, and there's only one other person in the entire world who knows what's causing it, and that  it's not a bad thing, and that I don't necessarily want it to stop.   But it's damned distracting.  Everywhere I look, reduced-cost flights.  Songs with a simple word dropped in with no apparent intent.  Books that just  happen  to be set... but is it all so simple?  Am I really stumbling upon these things, or subconsciously seeking them out?  Am I trying to subtly nudge my life in this direction?

                                               Review: This series doesn’t have far to go.  The recurring characters have already been stretched in all directions, so they are risking a loss of credibility (risking?) if they go much further.  The secondary characters are beginning to look familiar.  The situations that would in the early books have been almost unbearably tense are now taken in almost without a thought; this is a series, after all, and a popular one, so the author’s not going to let anything happen to one of her main characters, right?  Beside all this—and that is really the question, isn’t it? whether one can see past this?— Ten Big Ones  is a decent book.  It’s not tears-running-down-your-face funny like  urlLink One for the Money .  And it’s not scary as hell like that same book, whose Benito Ramirez is perhaps the best [i.e. worst] bad guy in fiction  ever .  The romantic triangle between Stephanie, Morelli and Ranger might be better in this installment than it has been lately, but it leads one to wonder how much longer any of them will have the patience for it.  The only actual "analysis" of this book that I'm going to give is to say that if you’ve read 1-9, then you’ll like 10, too.  I laughed my ass off through the last several chapters.  (There’s a scene involving a needle that  killed  me.)  Something about which I’d been curious for a while was revealed.  And the title makes sense.  But if this was the first book of hers that I’d read, I can’t say with certainty that I’d read more, and it sucks to say that.  I'd rate it a 7, based as much on my expectations of what this could have been as for some sort of "objective" reading of the actual book.    I think it's time for the series to end.

        Declaration : I will change the blog template before this weekend's over.  I found this survey in a classified location online, and I'd love to give attribution but it would reveal too much, so I'll just give a generic nod to the person through whom I found it.  It's ungodly long, so it'll be interspersed with other stuff.  1) Starting time: 11:00 AM exactly. 2) Full name: My full name is 24 characters.  3) Nicknames: Aim, A, and a few that are single-use. 4) School: Eastern Michigan University--if all goes well, for only 21 more days. 5) email: I have  7  email addresses, one of which is readily accessible from this blog. 6) eyes: blue 7) Height: it's no secret--64 inches 8) Siblings: two, both older 9) Ever been kissed: yes 10) Ever cheat or been cheated on?: yes 11) Ever missed school because it was raining? no 12) Ever faked sick? yes, but I felt so guilty that it wasn't close to worth it 13) Kept a secret from everyone? yes (what value as a friend would I have if I couldn't keep secrets?) 14) Had an imaginary friend? no 15) Wanted to hook up with a friend? yes--particular circumstances apply 16) Cried during a Flick? yes, most often intentionally.   urlLink Ghost , for example, was released the very day that my soul was crushed to a bloody fucking pulp by Russ Gehl.  I went to the movie by myself, sat in the back and stared at the screen unblinkingly while tears streamed down my face.  I had to go again later to see what the film was actually about--I'd only wanted a socially-acceptable excuse to cry at first.   17) Who is your "star crush"? N/A.  I'd be more likely to have a literary crush like the elusive Lawrence Selden in  urlLink The House of Mirth  or the wretched but beautiful John Willoughby in  urlLink Sense and Sensibility .  Willoughby has much in common with Russ, now that I think of it.   18) Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend? nqy   Touching memory : The only time I ever skipped school, I was a senior and suffering through an English class that I shouldn't have been in.  It was American lit designed for students who weren't destined for college.  Not sure how I ended up there.  It was difficult for me to pay attention because it went soooooo slowly.  I'd read ahead in the assignments and then have to backtrack to answer questions in class.  One day I was in the concourse (my high school was set up in two tiers, two floors of sort of balconies built around a large open area that was called the concourse, where we ate lunch and so most of the time it was filled with plasticated round-stools-attached tables, but the tables could be disassembled and moved out for dances and things.  There are  huge  windows on one wall [actually, the whole wall is windows] looking out at the lake and the bluffs.) before class with my friend JCL.  He was cajoling me to skip class and I was whining, "No, I've never done it, I can't do it, it's wrong, I'll get caught, I'll get in trouble, no, I can't...."  And eventually we'd been yapping at each other for so long that there was no one else there--we were late for class.  So he said, "It's tardy, or skip.  What's it going to be?!"  He smiled his devil-grin.  What could I do?  We hustled to the music wing, which is closer to the lake (and freedom), ditched our backpacks in the band room (always safe because of my close personal relationship with the band director...actually because no one would ever think anything of there being 2 backpacks in there at any time of day), and just headed out the door.  Walked out, kept going, got on the bike path, crossed the lake on the footbridge, and went toward the mall.  I was practically hyperventillating with guilt.  "This is  so  wrong!  We're going to get  caught!   I shouldn't be doing this!"  I think he eventually had to slap me.  We went to K-Mart, of all things, because I was too paranoid to go to the mall.  We were gone for an hour.  The next day, when we would be required to bring some sort of written excuse (from the principal's office!) for not having been in class, so I was  busted , there was an unexpected assembly 5th hour [when my English class was held] because of some sports thing or other.  Mr. Bailey never remembered to ask for my excuse.  I didn't get caught.  So why do I still feel a little funky about having skipped that hour?      FAVORITES  19) Drink: Alcoholic--vodka sour (but beer is good, too); Non-Alcoholic--a tie between Coke and lemon green tea 20) Food: mmmmmm, bacon!  No, no, no, before anyone gets all freaky, let me change that to a genre.  "Pub food."  French dip sandwiches, that sort of thing. 21) Restaurant: The Gandy Dancer in Ann Arbor?  Their white chocolate mousse with hazelnuts and fresh raspberries is killer.  But no, that place in Bethesda where that Asshole with the dreads stole our Creme Brulee...T--do you know what it was called?  I was way too drunk to remember.  As for places where I can eat without driving for 5 hours or (fucking) flying first, Johnny's for steak.  Or Za-Za's for pasta.   22) Shampoo: Joico Kerapro shampoo, Aveda Rosemary Mint conditioner. 23) Color: blue, gray, black 24) Summer/Winter? autumn (am I being obtuse?  wink) 25) Online/Offline? There's no way to answer this question without sounding like an ass, since I'm writing online but I live offline.  Let's just say that, like heaven and hell, I have friends in both places. 27) Like anyone: What,  do I  like anyone?  I would certainly fucking hope so, or I'm writing this with no audience.   28) Who have you known the longest out of your friends: Jennifer Franz, whom I met on my 5th birthday (8-27-75).   29) Who's the shyest? I have several shy friends, some for good reason and some because they're more obtuse than I am.  Prehaps it would be r.  Or maybe the CS. 31) Who do you go to for advice? Lately, I don't have to do any  going --it comes to me.  But there are a few in whom I put more trust than others, and they know who they are. 32) Who do you get along with? Like I'm mentally feeble enough to answer this question!   Question : Will I ever write the book[s] I want to write, or will I just go through my life thinking I'm a writer but not really writing?  IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS HAVE YOU  33) Cried: yes 34) Been mean: yes 36) Been sarcastic: yes--I live for sarcasm! 37) Been yelled at: no, although it would be appropriate 38) Talked to someone you have a crush on? yes 39) Kissed someone? no 40) Hugged someone: yes 42) Wished upon a star: no 43) Laughed until you've cried: yes--thanks to Nick, teller of nasty jokes and a thin piece of "American candy" 44) Played Truth or Dare: no 45) Watched a sunrise/sunset: yes 46) Went [geez, people, can you use proper grammar?  Try "gone", if each of these is really to be a second clause to "In the last 2 weeks have you..."] to the beach at night: no, 'cause the dingey little Kish doesn't have beaches 49) Were you [i.e. "been"] lonely? yes 50) Were you [i.e. "been"] happy? yes  51) Have you talked to someone online? yes, exhaustively    Analysis : I work with a person who is really, really lame.  They just started ticketing for Click It or Ticket nationwide, right?  And they ran advertising pretty much everywhere, reminding us all to wear seatbelts or risk a ticket.  So this woman, who's a flipping moron, gets a ticket on the first day that they're able to give them.  $55, plus $24 for driving without registration (she left her insurance card at home) and a fine for something else.  Because it ended up over $100, she has to appear--and pay court costs.  She came in late and  steaming  mad.    About a week later,  she got another one !  Just for the seatbelt violation, but still, another $55!  She's 32 years old.  There has been a seatbelt law in this state for several years.  It cannot have come as a surprise.  She was all stuttery and blustery, "fat fucking cop" and stuff, but come on.  Even Bart learned from the electrified cupcake after a while, didn't he?  This is my work environment.  It's no wonder I'm desperate for intelligent conversation.  DO YOU BELIEVE IN......  52) God/Devil: not exactly 53) Love: ditto 54) The Closet Monster: no 56) Heaven/hell: no 57) Superstitions? yes (crazy, ironic, but true) 58) Half empty or half full: I'm shooting for "just half" 59) Who named you? Mom & Dad, but I'm lucky that Dad didn't hold sway or I'd have been Ann-Margaret.  Hyphenated! 60) Favorite quote: Currently it's "Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end."  (Dan Wilson) 61) When was the last time you showered?  within 24 hrs of this point 62) What is the last thing u said online? probably "fuck"--I say it so often, it's a safe guess 63) What is right next to you?: to the left, a razor blade.  to the right, my tea mug, mobile phone and Amy Mix CD. 64) What is your computer desk made of? plastic wood-look crap 65) What was the last thing that you did? This is one of the most idiotic questions I've ever tried to answer.  The last legitimate work-like thing I did was to change location codes on the 23 books that were piled on my desk this morning. 66) Where do you want to go on your honeymoon? [5th] 67) Where do you want your wedding? [5th] 68) Where do you live?: in a house that looks pink but isn't, on a short street, in a town in which I do nothing but sleep 69) How's the weather? Lovely.  79°F, Fair, Feels Like 80°F, Humidity: 61%.  The weekend looks like crap but today's beautiful. 70) What did you do last night? obsessed 71) What are you doing tonight? decompressing 72) How do YOU eat an Oreo? I don't.  they're greasy and disgusting.  If I want cookies, I'll make my own. 73) All time favorite TV show:  urlLink Homefront ?  I'm not sure why but that one really got me.  The combination of entertainment (Kyle Chandler is fucking hot) and World War II.  Slightly more intellectual and thoughtful television.  Whatever--I liked it, and I'm not apologizing. 74) Dream vehicle: I'm tempted to give my standard response (MG Midget), but I'm leaning more and more in the direction of a  urlLink black Jaguar XK .  75) What do you want to be when you grow up? a grownup--with the minimum complement of baggage   Musing : My first mobile bill just arrived.  Not sure why I'm paying for it, since I  made  7 calls for a total of 5 minutes, but  took 5 calls for a total of 96 minutes--in 12 days.    I'm also not sure what I ever did without that phone.  76) Favorite music: I like a variety.  I think I want to hear more Simple Plan and Postal Service.  Semisonic, though, is doing it for me today. 77) Favorite band? see above.  I don't think about "music" in any terms except bands because I'm basically a one-genre girl. 78) Favorite food? Haven't we done this already?  I'll try a different one here--my college roommate Christine made a Butterfinger Torte that was  killer . 80) Favorite days of the week?  the earlier in the week, the better 81) Favorite animal?  domesticated 82) Brand of clothing?  I won't be tied down 83) If you could change your name, what would it be? Godforbid; I wanted to do this when I was 7 and I'd be Samantha Jennifer now.  Eeeew.  I'd be much more interested in finding out what the people who know me would re-name me, if they could. 84) Do you sleep with a stuffed animal? no 85) The most stupidest thing you have ever done? (other than to try to read this sentence as proper English? are you people on crack?!)  This remains to be seen.  However, using toilet paper as a substitute for gauze when I cut my leg on a broken window in college was pretty dumb, a sentiment that was brought home to me distinctly the morning after when I went to Health Service to have the glass removed and the nurse had to pull out the tp at the same time.  That was an especially painful Tetanus shot, too. 86) First Son's name? n/a 88) First daughter's name? n/a 90) First Crush? Earl Gittens, circa 1983.  First kiss, behind the public library.  The site of my doom.  He wasn't a bad guy and when we were in high school he tried to legitimize it somewhat.  I'd moved on. 91) On the phone or in person? in person, duh 93) If you could change something about yourself, what would it be? Most simply, my location--for now. 94) Where were you born? CMH, Winona MN 95) What kind of pets do you have? feline 96) Who sent this to you? (see top) 97) What do you think about this person? n/a 98) Your favorite songs? read the blog and figure it out 99) Anything you want to say to everyone? obviously--that's why I have a blog 100) Do you want your friends to do this survey? sure. 101) Time Finished: 12:41, tho I haven't worked straight through.

         ::Yankee Doodle Dandee::     Onesome: Yankee -  Hey, this is the 4th of July weekend here in the States; do you have any plans? Fireworks? Watching the Boston Pops? Hiding under the bed with the dog?  Dinner at home on Saturday night with T and L & G.  Nothing planned on Sunday, but I'm thinking of driving around looking for things to photograph--maybe a cemetery or something along that line.  I'm off on Monday, the first of my unexpected paid vacation days.  I'm going to try to convince T & L that we should wander downtown Naperville that day but they might have plans.  It might also be a hellish day to wander because of weather and the holiday.  It's my dad's birthday, too, so I should try remember to send his card tomorrow.   Twosome: Doodle -  Is there any paper safe from you, or are you a doodler? If you are, when are you most likely to doodle and what do you draw?  I doodle when I'm on the phone or when I'm nervous.  In the process of dealing with the @#$%ing thesis I've had occasion to go back through old class notes from college, grad school and law school.  Damn, I doodled a lot in those days.  I found my History of Brazil notes, the class that I took with Steve Voshell.  Among the other things that I scrawled in the margins were the names of our nine children.  If he knew that he might've thought differently about me at the time.  (But better, or worse?)  I'm a word-doodler, though, not a thing-doodler.  I can't draw to save my life.   Threesome: Dandee -  Or dandy. It's one of my favorite words. How about you, do you have any favorite words that you like to use, just because you like the way they sound or just because you can?  Ah--favorite words!  Let's see.  A list, prehaps?    Fuck   Rather   Prehaps   Ironical   Bonjour   Parakeet   Mitigate   Reasonable   Armadillio   Piquant   Marmalade   Entice   Unconscionable     Mmmmm.  Fun.

       Testing Meme Propagation In Blogspace: Add Your Blog! This posting is a community experiment that tests how a meme, represented by this blog posting, spreads across blogspace, physical space and time. It will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected. It may also help to show which blogs (and aggregation sites) are most influential in the propagation of memes. The dataset from this experiment will be public, and can be located via Google (or Technorati) by doing a search for the GUID for this meme (below). The original posting for this experiment is located at:  urlLink Minding the Planet  --- results and commentary will appear there in the future. Please join the test by adding your blog (see instructions, below) and inviting your friends to participate -- the more the better. The data from this test will be public and open; others may use it to visualize and study the connectedness of blogspace and the propagation of memes across blogs.

       People just aren't what they seem to be.  I just had a revealing, thoughtful conversation with someone that my best friend thinks is a pea-brain.  There was a program for the youth services summer reading volunteers this morning, in which they were challenged to match library staff baby pictures to their 7th (or so) grade pictures.  I see these people every day and had no clue which person was in which photo.  Spent last night listening to 3 people talk about a topic in which they're all extremely interested, then sitting in a loud, over-crowded bar struggling to find something about which to speak with them.  Eventually drank enough to cover not only that discomfort but any sense I might have had.  By the end of the evening I was pretty close to plastered.  As I've made the mistake of mentioning a couple of times today, if there'd been a guitar nearby, I'd have been strumming it and spontaneously writing songs about my dog getting kicked and my pickup falling into disrepair--I was a woeful drunk, but I covered it by taking dozens of [relatively unflattering] pictures of the rest of the crew.  My liquid of choice was Red Stripe, the distinctive container of which, one of my comrades said, looks "like a bottle of cough syrup."  I woke up this morning with a fuzzy tongue and a headache that extended beyond the bounds of my brain.  The tongue ailment was quickly remedied, but the brain problem continues.  Is it the alcohol that caused it?  Or is it the pain of knowing that I would do things differently, if I could go back and do them without the excess alcohol?  I suppose it doesn't matter, in the end.  The best I can hope is that the same medicine will cure either problem.

         ::Surprises in the Mail::     Onesome: Surprises --  Hey, do you like surprises? ...and what kinds? Birthday parties, dinners out? ...or are you one of those people who absolutely has to know what's going on before it happens?   I like surprises, but only good ones.  Is that self-evident?  I've had some surprises lately that have arrived in the form of shocks, which I could've done without.  But the everyday surprise is welcome.  Birthday parties--no thanks.  There was a surprise party for my 24th and it was horrid.  Too many people from too many points in my life converging, so I couldn't be the guest of honor--I had to mediate, explain and translate.  It was uncomfortable for everyone involved.  The only good things about it were drinking from the pitcher at each bar that we went to, getting my Brothers mug (from the bar called Brothers in Winona) without having to ring the damned bell, and seeing Chris Kauffman.   Twosome: in the --  nick of time: How do you keep track of birthdays and anniversaries and events you need to remember but only occur once a year? ...and where is your bailout place for cards and such when you've cut things a little too close?   I have one of those memories, so I can usually just remember birthdays and things.  My mom gave me a Hallmark card-keeper that has a space for each date of the year, so I have a master-list, but I don't refer to it very often.  That's more for keeping track of my cousins' kids.  (I have way too many cousins, and they have way too many kids.)  Hallmark cards, always; my standards are high.   Threesome: Mail --  Mail Call! Did anything interesting show up lately besides the bills? ...and do letters and cards still make it to your place or have email and ecards taken it all over? Inquiring minds and all that...   I've gotten 2 thank-you cards this week, one from someone whom I used to babysit who just finished an important segment of medical school [fuck, I feel old] and one from a friend whose birthday was last week.  I probably average one piece of personal mail each week--but I send at least one out, too.  I'll be stopping at the PO tomorrow on the way to work to drop off packages heading to Colorado and New York (and a goddamned thesis, Expressing to Michigan, a little bit late).  You can't win if you don't enter.  And "the joy is in the playing."

       Top five search hits of the week:  1. why whitman is referred as a father and teacher to ginsberg  2. Meaning  There is no greater treason than to do the right thing for the wrong reason  3. find me fuzzy butterfly chair covers  4. pictures of sumo wrestlers laying down on someone  5. shoes  eastlands  losers   Confidential to the author of #5, above:  You know that every time you--whoever you are, you paranoid Eastlandsphobic stranger--access this blog through a Google search with some godawful Eastlands reference, I'm inevitably going to write another post about it.  So there will be yet another link for it the next time you run your crazy search.  And you'll get this blog  yet again .  So why bother?  Why not, when you see "Get It All Down" as the link, just skip it?!  Or, if what you actually, subconsciously or consciously, desire is to read the damned blog, just read the damned thing rather than taking such a circuitous route toward it?  You, sir, are  very  strange.  Very strange indeed.  I had a fasting blood test this morning before work.  It was amazing--the phlebotomist (shout out to JPR & aunt!) found a plump one on the first try (with butterfly, of course) and left no bruise.  And while I sat there, draining ever-so-slowly into vial #2, the hefty, tough-looking man next to me  keeled over .  Just passed right out onto his lap.  I'd never seen it happen before.  When he regained consciousness several people were talking at once.  When he heard someone ask if he was OK, he said, "I just fell asleep, that's all."  Yeah, right.  That's why he was Casper-white and shaking.    Next stop,  urlLink Chesapeake Bagel Bakery .  Large orange juice and a Bacon Bagel for me (hold your comments, please) and a dozen bagel bites (2-inch rectangular bagels, either blueberry or cinnamon-raisin, with cream cheese frosting) for the homeys.  Er, the remainder of the library staff.  Recompense for my being late.  Tho, I wasn't even  that  late--I got in at 9:00, earlier than yesterday when I came in "on time."  I spent the day alternating between fucking processing (I hate hate hate hate hate processing) and finishing the ICode1 project.  Non-catalogers won't care, and even catalogers aren't likely to give much of a damn about this.  But as of about 3:00 this afternoon, every goddamned SPL item in the  urlLink catalog  has a distinct and accurate ICode1.  If we somehow manage to get our monthly statistics to each of the selectors in a timely fashion, we might manage to get a collection development policy that has some relevance to our actual patron usage.  Gnarly, eh?  (Sorry, I watched " urlLink I Love the 80s : 1982" last night.  I'd forgotten how much I loved  urlLink Fast Times at Ridgemont High .  A classic.)  Heard a heretofore unheard request today.  A group of us are going out tomorrow night after work.  A combination bon voyage party for EW, who's going to do her last two years of college elsewhere (bigger and better things!) and celebration for the Weather Guy, who's doing a program after his consulting stint in the afternoon.  Hmmm, I just realized how this is going to sound.  Not so good.  Perhaps I'll just say that someone who's not going to be at the bar suggested that he would've gone to the bar if he'd known I'd be there.  Yeah, that sums it up.  It wasn't exactly that overtly complimentary (nor that clean), but I'm not going to start something here that I'm not willing to finish.    I also got the hairy eyeball from a couple of people on my way to work.  Couldn't figure out why--I was driving reasonably well, considering my propensity toward squealing (although that isn't my fault, entirely, because the area where I drive is oddly sloped and other people have commented that they squeal there, too)--until I realized that the volume on the CD player was at 10 and the song was  Last Resort  by Papa Roach.  Yeah,  "Would it be wrong, would it be right If I took my life tonight  Chances are that I might Mutilation out of sight  And I'm contemplating suicide" blaring from my open windows.  Oops.  Sorry.  [chagrin]

       [Background: the "What Do You Think?" Mix.  Currently,  Better Than Ezra, "Briefly" ]  I had to leave work for a couple of hours this morning.  I enjoy that.  I miss being out during the day, the sense of playing hookey, the sly and cynical looks from others who are wondering why you're not a contributing member of society either--that you can be driving around at 2:30 for no apparent reason.  Of course, it's hotter than hell (weather.com says 82°/feels like 86° but the bank across the street says 96°) and no one in their right mind would drive around just for the hell of it on a day like this.    I was in the left lane, AC blasting, two tiny trails of sweat sliding down the back of my neck.  Jenica's ABC Mix in the CD player, Finger Eleven's "One Thing" blaring from the speakers.  Yes, I was singing, loudly enough that my mouth was open  all the way .  I caught a glimpse of myself in the rear-view mirror and stopped singing, but only long enough to nearly swallow my tongue.  The girl driving the car behind me had, while I was looking, executed a maneuver that I'd once done and thought I'd be the only person to ever do.  While flipping her rear-view mirror from the down to the up position (presumably to cut out glare?),  she flipped the thing right off the windshield .  It landed in her lap.  She's driving 40+ mph and suddenly has her rear-view mirror  in her lap .  [ Roachford, "Lay Your Love On Me" ]  The look on her face was  priceless .  Shock, annoyance, a bit of fear--I was  dying  laughing.  The next move was even better: she attempted to  push the mirror back onto the windshield .  As if it had been stuck on with Velcro® or something.  By this time, tears were streaming down my face and I was just about passing out from lack of oxygen.  I somehow managed to keep my car in the lane, but it was mostly luck.  Fucking hilarious.  Poor kid.  Too funny.  [ The Housemartins, "I'll Be Your Shelter" ]  I just discovered that a guy I've known for years (3? maybe 4?) is also a Housemartins fan.  I'd have sworn that I was the only person who even knew who The Housemartins  are , much less actively liked their music.  But he was ecstatic to discover my cache of their CDs--he'd thought they were out of print.  Very cool.  [ Eddie Vedder, "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away" ]  Speaking of the good old days (as I was, if vaguely), I'm thinking of changing the photo in my profile.  I'm not exactly looking for "votes", but if there are strong feelings as to whether the childhood picture is quaint or annoying, let me know.  [ Van Halen, "Love Walks In"  - sheesh, this is a  love -heavy mix, at least toward the end]  Coworker T is on vacation this week.  It's a good thing in that the office is extremely quiet (and at the same time I can play--and blare--anything I choose, musically) so I can concentrate.  It's also extremely dull, so I'm finding myself wandering out to the circulation desk more often seeking company.  Not a good thing, particularly when the boss is out there doing the same thing.  That doesn't reinforce my request for another employee to do the processing because I'm so damned busy.    [restarted the mix-- 3 Doors Down, "When I'm Gone" ]  The never-ending thesis rears its ugly head again.  Tonight will be devoted to last, last, last-minute editing so that I can mail it (Express, yet again, for another $13) to EMU so that the grad school can perform whatever voodoo is required to declare it officially done.  From there, I pay fees by credit card (for copying and binding) and they'll make the copies for me (sweet! no driving to Ypsi just to go to Kinkos!) and mail the non-EMU copies (i.e. the ones not destined for the library and grad school) to me when they're finished.    [ Live, "Forever May Not Be Long Enough" ]  I don't give a flying fuck about the last-minute changes, but I shall remove those extraneous commas and add those semicolons, and I'll even bite the bullet on the compose/comprise issue (a major sticking-point in my negotiations with the grad school reader) if it'll mean this goddamned monkey will vacate from its 10-year lease on my back.    How does one celebrate something like this?  Is it really an event worth "celebrating", or is it something about which I should be vaguely ashamed, having taken so long and being so...barely relevant to my life?  And goddamned expensive, all things considered?  Ah, fuck it, I know I'm going to celebrate, very likely with some extravagance (perhaps a new  urlLink black bag ? or even a  urlLink car ?), some Blue Moon Belgian White, and wishing I was taking that trip to a warm place.  That was not to be, but it would have been nice if it could've been.  [ Bob Mould, "It's Too Late" ]  Sigh.  Back to work.

       ~ Nomar is a Cub.  Is the world coming to an end?  ~ I have a lunch date for "sometime in early 2006" with a man with an accent.  Mysterious!  ~ Long, long conversations with old friends while watching the Mississippi River go by--a part of my life that I've missed even more than I'd realized.  If only I'd arrived two minutes sooner.  ~ Will I have to sell my soul to find a pair of black sandals?  ~ I wish I'd never heard of Nedstat or Site Meter.  Too much information.  ~ Got an email earlier today from the boss, filling in the details about Westlaw training this week in preparation for the arrival of the law library.  I'm not a member of the Reference department.  I have no practical need for the training.  Why should I go?  I really, really don't want to be an attorney, but if I'm going to be one, I'm going to make a fuck of a lot more money than I'm making right now.  The issue is how to get out of this situation diplomatically.  ~ 3 days away wasn't nearly enough.  I could've driven the River road for three whole days, or stared at the bluffs for all that time, to say nothing of soaking up the 15% slower atmosphere of town.  I know that I miss it, but the experience is always the sharpest right after I return.
