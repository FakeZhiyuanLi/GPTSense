       so i had a weird experience the other day..very weird, well to me anyways. i was in my room cleaning, like a good daughter should :D i had hawk nelson blaring, a very good band that everyone should listen to, when all of a sudden my radio alarm clock turned on by it's self.&nbsp;i turned around and was like..what the heck? i picked it up and noticed that the radio was already in the off section, there was no way it could be on while it's off.&nbsp;&nbsp;i tried pressing snooze, flicking it on and off, even dropping it on the floor..shh don't tell jen, it's hers, but the radio just kept on playing. the creepy thing was that it turned on just as that song "if i traded it all, if i give it all away for one thing, wouldn't that be something..." started. after i realized it wasn't gonna stop playing i just sat and listened to the lyrics of that song, something i had never done before. some how that song touched me and got me thinking about how i need to get right with God and truly trade all i am in and let Him pour His peace and love over me freely. as soon as the song ended the radio clicked off by it's self. maybe it was a God thing? who knows, but i was changed. the night before at youth we had been talking about weird experiences that had happened to us, so you'd think being in my room alone and having my radio randomly start blaring out music would scare the crap outta me, but for some reason i wasn't afraid and i knew i had to pay attention to the words of the song. God spoke to me thru 96.3!

       I was thinking lately about the many trials we face, the things we go thru and&nbsp;the people&nbsp;we run to for support. the thing i notice about me is i try to do things on my own..maybe to prove i'm strong and capable as i am..but i like to try to handle the things i get myself into, but nothing could be further from the truth. i need God, desperately so. i'm cranky and stressed when He's far. i lose focus, i lose heart and pretty much everything around me slips. my relationships, my grades, my attitude, my self-esteem, everything completely crumbles to pieces. it's during those times that i'm the weakest, but also when i feel my strongest, i put on such a strong act that i sometimes even fool myself..until everything becomes so crappy that i have to admit that i am at my weakest, lowest point. but, as soon as i call out for help and surrender my pride, God is there to scoop me up in His arms and hold me tight. but why must i run for so long? wouldn't it make more sense to just learn to lean on Him for my support? wouldn't it just be easier to rely on Him to take care of me instead of dragging myself down to these low points? i confess with my lips that God is mighty and powerful, magnificent and wonderful, creator of the universe, capable of doing all things. yet knowing this, i hold unto these burdens, fears, trials and sins like a life-support..first running to my friends for advice instead of running to the open arms of my Creator. it's weird tho..how many times has God let you down? how many times have your friends? but yet we run to those who are capable of making mistakes, gossiping and lying (gosh, let's hope not) and we place our trust in&nbsp;our friends&nbsp;instead of the One who is blameless, perfect in every aspect and knows your heart like no other. so why am i running from the arms that are reaching out with love and compassion? why am i running from the One who will never judge me on my downfalls? why&nbsp;am i running from the hands that can heal all my hurts?...i'm not athletic..and all this running is prolly why am so exhausted...i'm tired of walking down this same path over and over again, so for the last time i surrender. Lord Jesus, i'm tired, take me up in arms with You.

       "Forget what happened long ago! Don't think about the past. I am creating something new. There it is! Do you see it?"  - Isaiah 43:18-19                                                                                                                                                                                                        this last while has been the craps for me..my lacking relationship with God has continued to drag me deeper, life is nothing without Him as the center. the circumstance you go thru seem to hit u harder when He isn't near to protect you from the sting of life, i' ve realized this first hand since like..january. lately tho, i'm just so tired. i know i'm letting myself slip, but i just can't get to actually getting my life back on track, i know i'm sad, i know i'm weak..but i don't care...altho all this isn't really what i wanted this blog to be about..so back on topic.      my friend and i are in spot where we aren't exactly friends anymore because of something that happened more then a month ago..we aren't fighting, we just have lost all trust, and well, confidence in one another. it hurts to know that my good friend and i have lost such an amazing relationship over something so small, and that one little thing is still hurting hindering us today. i dwell on it, i think about how i could've done something differently, i worry about how things are gonna be between us tomorrow, but God says forget about what happened long ago! don't think about the past and how you could've changed things. and nothing could be more true. i don't need to worry about what went down then..but make changes for what is going down now. the funny thing is that God really is creating something new in our relationship, sometimes, ever so slightly i can see a hint of a new friendship beginning..not one that was made out of weird circumstances like it was before..but a true one. the truth is tho, that if i dwell on the relationship we once had, i'll miss the one that is blossoming rite under my nose.     i guess God has more instore for this blog then i thought..because all that above applies to what i thought was off topic before. i don't need to think about my circumstance that happened this year, i can't think about how i've let my relationship with him crumble time and time before, i can't get down on myself and lose focus on Him because He's creating new blessings and new joys and new hopes in my life everyday...dwelling on the horrible past only distracts me from seeing the wonderful things he's creating before my eyes. thank you God for creating new things, and to speaking to me, help me use what i learn and put it into action.
