      Sometimes we close our eyes and just listen to the echoes of our hearts. We all fall in luv and there are times when we love so much that we lose ourselves in our own emotions. More often than not, we wonder why there are love that grows, and love that grows cold. We would start to search for answers and try to find where love has gone wrong. But in the end, we find ourselves where we started for we cannot question love when it has its own reasons. Love will always be as it always has been... silent, mysterious and deeply profound.Many of us believe that love is forever, that love never dies, only to be disillusioned in the end when we find our hands empty and our hearts longing. We mistakenly have looked at love as a need to be fulfilled. But love is only a gift given to us. We should not hold it in our hands for we may never find the strength to let it go when it decides to leave. We should only embrace its warmth and glow while it last and then freely open our arms when its time to say goodbye.When we fall in luv with someone, we don't want that feeling to end for it is everything we are, everything that we wanted to be. We pray that love will stay and grow in our hearts. But, if it doesn't then we should never let our lives be taken by it, for life should not end where heartaches begin.There is always reason why we have to move on. When we have to say good-bye to the feelings we wanted to stay forever, let us not wave our hands with a heavy heart. For love will have to set its wings free and find the place where it belongs.We may have lost it but then again, when we close our eyes and listen to the echoes of our hearts, we will hear that feeling resounding silently forever.Then we'll know that it has never left us, for the good that we have become because of love will always stay. It will always be there reminding us that we should be thankful and happy, not because we have lost luv, but because, for once in our lives, that feeling lived in our hearts and made us happy.

       ~Life is like an onion; you peel off one layer at a time and sometimes you weep~   Well, i woke up at 4 a.m. this morning.  Dad had surgery and we had to be at the hospital at 5.  Wanna talk about a stressful day?? Cuz that's exactly what i had.  We arrived and had to wait until 7 which is when his surgery was scheduled.  Then he went in, they called to inform us that he went under and there were no complications thus far.  Then came the 2 and a half hour wait.  Waiting for word that it was over.  Finally after meeting many other patients' families, and many spanish worksheets later,  the doctor came with word that he was out of surgery and in recovery.  This meant that I was off to school, not knowing when he would wake up or when i would be able to talk to him.  Well, I arrived at school a little into second block, extremely tired.  I wasn't in the mood to do anything so i just took a little nap in guidance....nice n relaxing...din't last to long.  So then, off to lunch...im still way out of it wondering whether or not he has woken up yet.  So, i eat cookies cuz my stomach can't hold much else....i call my dad's room once..no answer...this is me getting a little bit scared...  So then, i go back to the table set down the cell and do a lil hw.  Well, the infamous haeger comes along and confiscates the cell.  How awesome...can't even call my own dad to see if he's allrite in the hospital, wow.  So i get called to ver boomen thinking i'm really in for it ya kno, him being the dean of students and all.  I go in, not knowing what to expect and he starts talkin.  "I would have waited to call you down at the end of the day, but i recognized your name and i just wanted to let you kno....you had an awesome game last nite."  So he rambles on about basketball things, gives me the cell and i'm on my way.  But of course before i leave he asks why i'm crying.  I say it's obviously not becuz of the cell phone being taken away, im not that gay.  So i tell him the dad situation and he allows me to call once more...no answer yet again.  So, he tells me to come back after 3rd hour to try again.  Well, i'm on my way to 3rd hour...i start bawling, and after a hug, balda convinces me to go to guidance so back to guidance i go. (i'm obviously not gunna walk into spanish class crying...albers would probly go nuts).  So i go to guidance, talk to jedlicka, chill out a little bit and make my way to spanish.  Things go well and after that i try yet once again to getta hold of my dad, but to no avail.  By this time i'm getting extremely scared and emotional...i dont really kno what to think and all i wanna do is getta hold of my dad.  I try to go the rest of the day, one whole block plus advisement or "extended learning time" if you will, just thinkn, i'll be able to talk to him after school.          So, off to key club, after which i receive a hug from a very good friend, and makes me feel sooo much better.  I can't even describe how much that meant to me.  But, i get home, fall asleep becuz of my sleep deprivation as of last nite and eventually wake up to my brother asking me sum question which i dont remember...my answer being no...and falling back asleep.  Well, after this, i wake up to an empty house...not knowing where anyone is and eventually i get a call from my mom at the hospital...should have known.  I FINALLY got to talk to my dad so all my fears are gone and everything's good.  He's kinda drugged up on morphine so i couldnt understand a whole lot but hearing his voice and knowing he's ok just lifted a lot of stress off my shoulders.  I can tell you this once again, if i didn't have my friends, i dont kno what i would have done today.  Thanx to all you guys and girls that care about me and are helpn me thru this.  It's not easy but without you guys, it would be so much worse................

      I took my love, I took it down Climbed a mountain and I turned around And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills Til the landslide brought it down.  Oh, mirror in the sky -what is love? -can the child within my heart rise above? -can I sail thru the changin' ocean tides? -can I handle the seasons of my life? I dont kno.....  Well, I've been afraid of changin Cuz I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder Even children get older And I'm getting older too  Take my love, take it down Climb a mountain and turn around -and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills well the landslide will bring it down

      I'm in a quoting mood...think about some of these...                                  *Love is never lost.  If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart."  Washington Irving*    *Hatred never kills, love never dies.  Such is the vast difference between the two.  What is obtained by love is retained for all time.  What is obtained by hatred proves a burden in reality for it increases hatred.*  Gandhi   The sage said, "The best thing is not to hate anyone, only to love.  That is the only way out of it.  As soon as you have forgiven those whom you hate, you have gotten ride of them.  Then you have no reason to hate them; you just forget"                                         *Love never dies a natural death.  It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source.  It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals.  It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.*   *The remarkable thing is that we really love our neighbor as ourselves: we do unto others as we do unto ourselves.  We hate others when we hate ourselves. We are tolerant toward others when we tolerate ourselves.  We forgive others when we forgive ourselves.  We are prone to sacrifice others when we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.*

      *That thing. That moment when you kiss someone and everything around you becomes hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this person. And you realize that that person is the only person you're supposed to kiss for the rest of your life. And for one moment you get this amazing gift, and you wanna laugh, and you wanna cry... 'cause you feel so lucky that you found it and so scared that it'll go away all at the same time.*  I miss that feeling...and if u kno me...u've probly noticed i haven't been the happiest person this week.  Despite the dreaded finals and my deprivation of sleep making me crabby, there have been numerous other things.  I miss....i miss everything...everything that used to be...that used to be good.  I dont kno how to explain it, it just kinda sux.  No matter how I hard i try...i can't let go and it's killing me inside.  (If you dont understand what the hell im talkn bout...dnt worry, ur probly one of many).  I still get butterflies, i'm definitely jealous (yes i can admit it), and this...this whole thing just doesn't seem real to me.  It's like it's a gigantic nightmare and I just NEED someone to wake me up.  I guess things are tough...and im not strong enough to endure most of it.  Along with those things comes my dad.  His surgery is in 8 days and its becoming scarier each day.  And i guess my parents are both havn surgery in the same week which i was not informed about.  Dont ya think thats kind of a good thing to tell ur children?? Guess not.   On a better note, i had a good day...probly failed my finals, but the after school part was dominant.  Arby's & Culvers was good, lol and of course Matt's was fun too...til Ericia and i had to go to practice, along with Brad who had wrestling, but thats besides the point...it was a good time, lets just leave it at that...and DJ!...TURN TABLE!!!  God, i love all those guys, couldn't have fun w/o em.  And yes, I mean ALL of you!  Well, i'm tired...7 hours in 2 days is just not enough sleep for me so until next time...good nite!!!  "I know God only gives you what you can handle...but does he have to trust me so much?!"

      After reading Giesen's blog tonite, i have realized one thing: I'm letting drama control my life.  There are so many things i have been worrying about, thinking about, hell even dreaming about, things that i shouldnt be.  So many things have been going on in my life...My dad's cancer, the kyle thing, basketball, things that just happen on a daily basis.  Yes, there are some of these things that i should be concerned about, but i need to learn NOT to dwell on them.  Some things in life just need to be forgotten, other need more attention payed to them, and some just dont need to occur at all.  I want to leave all the drama behind me, with the exception of my dad.  I want to be me, not me with drama takin over my life.  This break was the best break i could possibly have. Busy every single day with people.  Whether we had anything specific to do or not, we were always together.  The TRUE friends that I have.  The true friends that i care about.  I have all the friends i need rite there.  Yea there's always gonna be the one that i would give the world for but he doesnt give a rats ass back...but thats just something i have to forget about, something i can't dwell on no matter how much it tears me apart.  Some people are just downright evil and pathetic and all they want in life is to be popular and better than others.  No matter who they have to hurt on their way up.  Just remember whoever you step on on the way up, ur gonna meet on ur way back down.  Shit happens in life, but no matter how tough the shit, life does go on.  And i have learned that.  I'm gonna take what Giesen did for his life, and transform it into something i can use for my life.  The teenage years are hard and I for one kno that, but im not gonna let the drama, the obstacles, and the heartbreaks take over my life.  I'm gonna let them make me a stronger and better person.  And thanx to my true friends and family, that is totally possible.     ~If you cannot solve it, it is not a problem - it is reality~ Anonymous ~Life is like Ice Cream, enjoy it before it melts.~ Anonymous ~Everyday is a good day, some are just better than others~Anonymous  -:-Worry about your character and not your reputation, because your character is who you are, and your reputation is only what people think about you-:-

            ~Maybe this world is another planet's Hell~ -Aldous Huxley-  Wow...society is so fucked up...thats the only way i can describe it... It's so awesome though, its hilarious and wierd, and even disgusting, all at the same time.  Life always brings those little surprises, sum good, sum bad...either way...they've treated me well so far...despite a few little heartbreaks here and there, lol.  But hey, shit like that happens to the best of us.   So today is the last day of break thats actually worth something.  Tomorrow's a sunday and not to many ppl do stuff on sundays...specially those procrastinators who wait till the last second to do their hw.  But we'll see if the boyz n i get together before the dreaded school starts again.  This break has definitely been awesome because of them and of course a select few others and we can't forget the absent one.  That was probly the best part ever. :-D  Ya, i kno, i can be harsh, but hey life can be 20 times more harsh, dont we all kno that.  Everythings fallen into place these past few months.  I kno my true friends, and really...thats all i need to kno.  Whether they're all the way in Madison or a few streets over, i love them all.  U all kno who u are.  And if u dnt kno...u should probly ask...just a suggestion.    ~Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.~                                      - Albert Einstein -  So tonite we had a game against Appleton North.  They're a good team, i must admit.  They've got agility, very quick, and VERY lucky.  U kno how that goes.  I wont get into that or this will end up being a 10 page paper.  But no, we did not win, but we didn't lose either.  We gained experience, and we kno what we'll have to do to dominate next time.  "We didn't lose the game; we just ran out of time."  - Vince Lombardi -  Yup, so thats just a very small insignificant insight to whats goin thru my head...i think i'd have to be here forever if you were ever going to understand me and whats goin on up there...hell...i dnt even think i understand half the time...but until next time, good nite!

      Ok, so like on February 16, i wrote this, before the incident, before the break up, before all of that...  "I'm in an unexplainable mood tonite...wondering things, saying random things....yeah, just wierd. Thinking a lot....thinking thinking thinking.....probly about stuff i shouldn't be worrying about....stuff that is of no concern at this moment...but wait...maybe it is, maybe i should worry...after all, anything can happen. Your life can change in a split second...and what are you to do after that change?"  Um...can we say...ironic?  I'm not sure about u, but i think it is.  My life was changed in a split second...and honestly...im not dealin w/this change too well.    guess im jus kinda speechless....or wordless...or w/e....  good nite for now i guess.....

I have to have a chat with my coaches at 6:40 in the morning!!! Wow, so early, but hey its gotta be done.  I also have to meet with some other people to discuss...other things.  I'm finally thinking everythings gonna be ok...at least on that side of things.  I still miss *someone* oh so much....its so hard not to.  Even though we're still friends...its just....well i guess indescribable how much i miss "us"...  Thats one of the harder things to get past...but yeah, i'll do the best i can i guess...and i just gotta realize that i can't change things that can't be changed...:-\             Love u all...and until next time mwah :-*

      Another day gone by since the "incident"....things are SLOWLY improving.  And when i say slowly, i mean it.  I have lost a few ppl because of parents....not gunna get into that.  But i will survive.  Today was better than yesterday and worse than tomorrow.  I can only see things getting better, yeah there's guna be the occasional bump in the road, but i have my friends to help me thru it.  Most of them newayz.  Well....im facing the consequences and such so......yea, idk what else to write.......i love you all...hopefully u still love me to :-\

      yeah, so a lotta shit's gone down the past couple days.  If you dont kno, you dont need to kno.  But its sum tough shit, idk if im gunna be able to handle it alone.  Which is why i have the help of my friends.  There's a few that say they'll be there, but i kno them well enough that when other ppl start givn em shit, they're gunna back down n leave me hangn.  I jus gotta depend on the ones i kno i can depend on.  People make mistakes n this time i made a huge one.  I guess the part that hurts the worst is that the person im sposed to trust in & confide in the most...is the one who "called it"  It hurts...hurts a lot....n i kno i've let a lot of ppl down, hell i've let myself down, i screwed up big time....but i'm human.  That's all i can say...is im human and human's make mistakes...:-\  This is just one i really shouldnt have made...

      Ok, so I have the bestest friend in the whole wide world....and i sooo have MOSTEST on u Susie!! lol...k so, im gunna list the reasons on why we're such GREAT friends...and then sum wierd stuff u should kno bout our friendship...cuz yes, i kno you wanna kno it!  Well, first of all, we are both shy but when we get together...NOTHING shuts us up, and trust me, i mean nothing.  We get along so well and can trust each other with anything.  There's so much we kno about each other, its scary.  We finish each others sentences, we kno what the other's thinking.  And we always kno when the other one is down or in pain (since we all kno we're both always killing ourselves) .  Ok, well now that you kno we have like everything in common and are CRAZY when we're together, i'll get to the even wierder stuff.  Ok, so last Christmas, we got each other Christmas presents like any normal best friends would.  Well, she was in madison, i was here in Appleton & we refused to mail each other the presents...we had to give them to each other in person.  Well we were on the phone, chit chattn it up and we were so curious so we each started giving little clues as to what we got the other person.  Well, it started sounding like we got the same thing for each other...but how could that be??? We got such personal things (u'll understand when im finished)  So finally we get to the point that we agree we got the same thing for each other....we read the serial number and precisely what we expected, it's the same!!!  LOL, we both got each other photo albums from "things remembered" or sum store w/a wierd name like that....they were both blue, both had stuff engraved on them....both had the same thing engraved in them...whatta coincidence...Very very wierd....but the fun doesnt stop there.  Down the line we find that we have the same shoes, same coats (not so much a coincidence), same hats, braided our hair on the same day, same shirts....the list goes on n on....Basically, we were destined to be friends, dont think i could live w/o her.  and hopefully the feeling's mutual...:-P  She's my bestest bestest friend and helps me through everything! And vice versa of course.  Oh and she's gotta be an awesome friend if she spends her spring break COMING TO SCHOOL WITH YOU?!  I mean who goes to school on their spring break??  Obviously Susan Carlson...My best friend.  :-D

      I'm striving for what will make me a good person and be able to share it with others.  One day, I will be that person.  I won't be perfect, but I will be an improved person from what I was the day, and the year before.  I will be able to look back on the way I was and say, "Wow, I did make some changes..."  But if I dont work hard everyday at what i'm currently doing, nothing else will come along from God's plan.  He knows when ur not ready to move to the next level.  As a result, he will not open that door for you to go through....

      A simple friend has never seen u cry. A real friend has shoulders soggy from ur tears. A simple friend thinks the friendship is over when u have an argument. A real friend knows that its not a friendship until after you've had a fight. A simple friend hates it when u call after he's gone to bed. A real friend asks why u took so long to call. A simple friend, when visiting, acts like a guest. A real friend opens ur fridge and helps himself. A simple friend wonders about ur romantic history. A real friend could blackmail u with it. A simple friend expects you to always be there for them. A real friend expects to always be there for you.  Which one are you???

      Step into the light Because your face is darkened From the night Will I focus my attention On things more important than me and my life  These days will change Like memories fade into yesterday  In the heart of every moment Lies a truth and a message, I might not know Can't forget the time we shared The lessons learned in the past I'll forever hold  These days will change  Like memories fade Into yesterday And when I go What will I know And what will they say  I fade to sleep and I dream Secrets I keep, with everything It seems if I believe it I might see you  These days will change Like memories fade Into yesterday And when I go What will I know And what will they say  (My dream is gone)  We fade to sleep and in our dreams Answers we seek to anything Awake only to see that  My dream is gone....

      Dreams really do come true??  Good one....life can never be simple.  There will always be those so-called friends that can't just let you live your life how you wanna live it...and then you let them get to you and change your life just for the approval of your friends.  Sounds immature doesn't it? Yeah, I kinda thought so too.  Yeah, life's hard to deal with, especially when you want something and all your friends disagree.  But don't you think that if you want that something, your friends should just be happy for you?  After all, it is your life, isn't it?  I suppose with some people, it's more difficult than others...but in time they're gonna have to realize that if they are your true friends, they won't stop you from your dreams, the things you want in life, having your own opinion, any of that.  But you have to start by standing up for yourself...and if you dont do that....ur fucked.

      As we lay there quiet I was reminded of all the reasons why I lust you Your smile, The way it teased at me seductively Your laugh, and the way it tempted me Your eyes, and the way they seemed to hypnotize me  As we sat there silent I was reminded of all the reasons why I cared for you Your smile,  and the way it brings such life into me Your laugh, and the way it makes everything okay Your eyes, and the way they seem to read my thoughts  As we stand here now I am reminded of all the reasons why I dont understand u Your smile, and the way it confuses me Your laugh, and the way it seems to mock me Your eyes, and the way they can look into mine and not feel a thing.  *Cara Elizabeth*

I smile when I see you You smile when you see me I bleed when I see you You smile when you see me  Screaming. Crying. Inside. Laughing. Smiling. Outside. I wave to you.

       My Mind   You make me love Love like I could never lose anything Like I'm invincible Like nothing could ever go wrong But it always does  You make me hate Hate like I've never done anything wrong Like I'm not a bad person Like I have a reason to hate anyone But I don't  You make me love to hate Only because I myself feel like shit I myself feel worthless I myself feel...nothing  You make me hate to love Only because I only know one love And that love was broken That love will never be again And no matter how much I get hurt by that love No matter how much that love betrays me There will always be that small part in my heart...that loves And that is what I hate the most  *Cara Elizabeth*

      A well-known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20.00 bill.  In the room of 200, he asked, "Who would like this $20 bill?" Hands started going up.  He said, "I am going to give this $20 to one of you, but first let me do this. He proceeded to crumple the $20 dollar bill up.  He then asked, "Who still wants it?" Still the hands were up in the air.   Next he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty.  "Now, who still wants it?"  Still the hands went into the air.  "My friends, we have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what was done to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value.  It was still worth $20. Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless." "But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who DO love you. The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or who we know, but by WHO WE ARE." "You are special - Don't EVER forget it."  Count your blessings, not your problems. Never be afraid to try something new. And remember: amateurs built the ark ...professionals built the Titanic!  hehe...luv u all!!  Until Next Time,   Your Carebear :-P

      "*Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you, and yet you can never have them... when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips, you miss them? Have you ever wondered which hurts the most: saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had? Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart... But if you don't, you might break theirs. Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person? Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't. You can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own... when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to. Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you? Too many of us stay walled because we are too afraid to care too much... for fear that the other person doesn't care as much or even at all. Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever? Or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watched him/her fall for someone else? Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle? We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what will be found out about us. But everytime we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger. Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have or could have had. No one waits forever* "  Very nicely put Felicia....very nice...

      It's not that I don't care. I do. You are my good friend. Best friend, even. Not that you ever said so. Nor responded when I did. Rarely anyway, if at all. But   I   cared.    I   did. You're the one who's to blame here. These irreconcilable differences. You caused them. It's you, not me. I tried, we failed. I was always there. You were off on the town. Self-absorbed. But this final episode, that was the straw that broke my back. Thats why we're finished. History. A very bad memory. That's why I'm here, this evening. That's why, as you lie before me, peacefully resting, fast asleep, I will finally have the last word. Just before I end your world. I loved you that much. Sweet dreams. You piece of shit. Sweet dreams.

      gotskillz09 [11:34 PM]:  i love you   Lies....all fuckin lies.  All the conversations lasting for hours late into the night.  All the cuddling for hours just layin in the basement.  All worthless to you.  Meant nothing to you.  Or so you say now.  Who knows if it did, who knows if it didnt...all i kno is i can't understand how you can treat a person so horribly.  How can a person be so cruel, two-faced and backstabbing, saying things like "the whole time i was with her, i was still lookin for someone else," or "we were never really together" and who knows what else.  How can someone tell you they care about you sooo much and then turn around only to act like you dont even exist.  How can someone be that low, that pathetic, that heartless.  I just dont understand...what did i ever do to make u wanna hurt me so bad.  All i ever did was love u, cherish u, treat u perfectly, and how do u repay me?  You break my heart, you take away the happiness in my life....i can't even remember the last time i was happy.  All i feel is hatred and all i want is revenge, but i kno thats not the way to go about it, cuz i dont wanna sink to your level.  I dont wanna hurt you like you hurt me, cuz no one in this universe deserves to feel that hurt.  No one should feel how i feel now....no one...  *Where you used to be, there is a hole in the world, which I find myself constantly walking around in the daytime, and falling in at night.

       Deep down u kno its best for yourself but you  Hate the thought of her bein w/someone else  But you kno that its over  We know that its through  Let it burn  Let it burn  Gotta let it burn  I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need ta move on  On the other side I wanna break down and cry  I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need ta move on  On the other side I wanna break down and cry   I dont wanna get in-depth w/this blog so im jus gunna put it all out there plain and simple.  Life will never just be normal for me.    Linz and i have been hangin around lately...and its made me realize a lot of things.  Her and i feel exactly the same about robby and kyle...its so hard.  Quote from her..."I feel like there are so many other ppl out there, but i only want the one that i used to have. the one that knows all my secrets, the one that used to hold me so tight, caught my tears, made me laugh, and the one who told me he loved me"  That's exactly what i want.  I dont kno why, i really dont.  I mean i see other guys that i can have, i have guys interested in me and stuff...but seeing this kinda made me realize, im not ready to move on.  I dont kno why....i just miss the security of what i had i think?  Wow, im so confused and frustrated, my life doesn't even make sense to me.    I remember one time...i was crying so hard fer something real stupid, and we were all at julian's house...everyone was in another room and we were just friends at this time....so i was sittin on the little couch...and he came in there to see if i was alrite...and he just sat in there w/me and held me for what seemed like hours...i want that back so much.  I dont even think i need him as a bf nemore.  I just want our closeness back.  If that's all i can get, that's what i'll take. I need him in my life and it hurts so bad to think that he doesn't miss me one bit.  I guess thats the part that hurts the most. That or the fact that maybe....just maybe...he does miss me, but can't admit it cuz his so-called friends will rip him apart.  But thats a slim to none chance.  I just dont kno what to do nemore, i hate that this is getting to me.  And when i think about it...I have never acted this way about ne other guy.  I've never felt this way about anyone.  It's tearing me apart inside.  And hearing things from people isnt helping.  I dont even care if its true or not....i just hate hearing it....cuz if i do hear it, there must be at least a little truth to it...  Why do i care so much?  Why do i love him so much?  Why can't i let go?  I've tried and tried and all it does is make me love him and miss him more...and people dont help...every day its kyle this and kyle that...i just wish it would all stop....yet i dont.  I want things back to normal...cuz this isnt normal for me....  The worst part:  It seems like i dont even exist to him nemore, and in reality....maybe i dont.  Maybe i'm just an acquaintance now...nothing more than another person in the hallway.  I wanna move on and start something with someone else...but its just not fair to him that i'm still so in love with kyle.  I dont kno what to do.  I think i just need to sit down and talk to him.  Get things up in the air n have sum knowledge of what's goin on...  I need to go to bed, gotta wake up in 5 hours...i'll finish up next time.  Love you all *leave sum advice if u have any*  *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      The past weekend has been a good one i must say.  Been chillin w/Linz & Heather tonz n tonz.  Its been a good time, road trips out to hortonville every nite...chillin w/the boyz n such....its been interesting to say the least.  Today, linz n i hung out w/balda fer the majority of the day. It was a good time..mmm macaroni n hot dogs, taha.  Yeah then we figured after a few hours of bein lazy it was about time to do something else.  So, we rented a movie, i called up giesen, and we went to my house to be lazy for a few more hours.  It was a good time!!  Movies all day, now thats my idea of a good time (specially after early mornin softball pract. and 3 hours of sleep)   Then Hoh called and came too...during sum point in the nite, buzzed head and all, oh wow....not gonna get into that one.  Brad n i had a nice little arguement to say the least.  I (being the awesome person that i am) cried....(it was a touchy convo i guess u could say) But yeah, he pissed me off....still a little irrate about it, but what's new...stuff like that has come to be expected of bradley hoh.  I'll be over it in a few, no biggie i suppose.  So, things are arising....  Feelings are coming and going and blah...its all wierd, lol.  I'm finally moving on, but sumtimes things just trigger my emotions and it all comes back....n then 2 min. later, im perfectly find n have my sights set on what i want again. (like tonite for example)  I need to just forget.  Linz n i have been talkn bout this alllll weekend.  It's sweet cuz we feel EXACTLY the same about pretty much EVERYTHING.  It's so good to have someone to talk to who understands everything ur goin thru cuz they're goin thru the exact same thing.  I'm glad her and i have worked things out and can talk to each other....its a lot of help for both of us.    So, i have had feelings for a friend for awhile now...but im just not sure i wanna risk it.  I mean i dont wanna risk the friendship, i dnt wanna hurt him, dnt want him to hurt me.  But then again, life is nothing w/o a lil bitta risk....ahh...idk he understands me so well, that could be taken as a good or a bad thing.  I'm just so lost as to what to do rite now.  He knows all my feelings towards kyle and that mite push him away because in all reality, who the hell wants to be w/someone if they love or even feel a little bit of love for someone else.....honestly....  I'm so out of stuff to say, i mean i have so much more in my mind...i just dnt think i can put it into words rite now.  I love all of my friends so much, dont ever forget that, and dnt worry, no matter how much you piss me off, im bound to forgive you at sum point.  K, im done rambling now.  Have a good one   *Cara Elizabeth*

      Realization of the nite:  Some people just dont kno what they're missin.  You can be a hypocrite all you want.  Hate me because i made one mistake and then like other girls who do it all the time, n who are 10 times hotter than i am.  I'm sorry im not in the top 10% of girls, im sorry i wasn't born w/the looks of a supermodel.  I'm sorry my looks can't make everything better...i mean the "hott ones" can make all the mistakes they want, but you dont care cuz they're hott...it makes up for it.  But I'm me, i guess that's all there is to it.  I want you to go for the hott ones...the ones who will never care bout u as much as i did...I want u to do that.  It's the best thing fer u to do.  Cuz in the end, you will really kno just how much ur missing.  ;) luv u all!!! n have a good one.  *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      So i've been thinkin about this for quite awhile: "How is it that you can have such strong feelings for someone and within a day...drop them all."  Answer: You can't.  It's virtually impossible.  You can cover it up, you can deny it, but everyone knows damn well, ur just lyin to everyone, including yourself.  Only time can heal all...and thats exactly what its done for me....time has healed all; all has been healed. ;)  Now, as for other things...  Thinking a lot, a lot on my mind.  I have everything sorted out in my head, but i can't seem to tell people.  I can't seem to just lay it all out on the line.  I think only one person knows, n that person seems to completely understand. Hopefully u kno who u are...and hopefully ur relationship thing works out fer the best....hint hint  But yah, just goin w/the flow lately.  Hakuna Matata.   *Cara Elizabeth*

      I think i've come to a conclusion about my life.  It is what i make it. And i make it shitty.  Now, i'm making a decision to make it...not shitty. Sound good? Yea. I thought it did.  I wanna be happy...but i'm so sad alll the time, and ive come to the realization that...its all in my head.  I can cover it up...usually very well.  But, i think i jus want the sadness gone all together.  I think i just need to find what truly makes me happy, no, not a boy, because a boy is not going to complete my life, i thought it would at one point and look how things turned out. I was devastated(...still am sumwhere in my heart as you can see from the previous entry) but...i need to start over, i need a fresh start.  How am i going to get this? Honestly, i have no clue yet.  But somehow, i will, i hope.    *Cara Elizabeth*

       I hate you....and then i love you....it's like...i wanna throw u off a cliff....then hightail my ass to the bottom n catch u....it fuckin sux   I shouldnt care or wonder where and how u are. But I cant hide this hurt inside my broken heart. Im fighting back emotions that Ive never fought before, cuz Im not supposed to love u nemore.  *I wish I had the guts to walk away and forget about what we had. But, I cant becuz I know you wont come after me, and I guess that's what hurts the most.*  *True love? I used to believe it existed, but when youve had your heart torn out and thrown on the floor, you just dont care anymore. . Ask me why I keep on loving*  *when its clear that you dont feel the same way for me... the problem is that as much as I cant force you to love me, I cant force myself to stop loving you. *  *It hurts the most when you can actually feel your heart breaking.*  *I cant cry hard enough for you to hear me. *  You love to hate the one who loves the one you hate to love.   Even if my heart should call out your name in the rain. Even if these arms should want to embrace you again. And even if Im all cried out and no longer in pain... i'll never fall in love that way again.   The ones that you love the most are usually the ones that hurt you the most.   When you are in love and you get hurt, its like a cut... it will heal, but there will always be a scar.  * I miss you a little, I guess you could say, a little too much, a little too often, and a little more each day*  *There's this place in me where your finger prints still rest... your kisses still linger and your whispers softly echo... It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me*   *When you said forever, you meant a few months. When I said forever, I meant every day until I died. When you said always, you meant until you couldn't handle it anymore. When I said always, I meant until time ended. When you said you loved me, you meant I was no different from any other girl. When I said I loved you, I meant I had never felt what I felt for you...*  *Cara Elizabeth*

      Well....im sitting here...crying with my teddy in my arms.  I have decided to take a much needed break from my blogging days.  Occasionally, i will be adding quotes, but there will be no more thoughts from my head....yep, thats rite...no more depressing thoughts from the mind of Cara Elizabeth.  I hope you're all ecstatic with this decision...i can only imagine how happy some of you are.   Goodnite, and farewell to all.  I shall see you again in the future, but for now, i love you, and may God bless you with all the love that you deserve.  Sincerely,  *~Cara Elizabeth~*  (and Teddy)

      I have never hated anyone as much i hate you right now. You never seize to amaze me. I can't even put my hate into words. It's impossible. Gahh im just so flustered and so frustrated. I just dont understand how someone can....(sigh)  You kno what....ur not even worth my time.  I'm not gonna waste anymore precious time writing about you, thinking about you, or even talking about you.  It's just not worth it.  You're not who i think you are and i've finally come to that conclusion.  When I first met you, i thought you were the sweetest person in the world, you always managed to put a smile on my face u were the awesomest friend anyone could have, and i had you.  But now, I know the real you.  And i absolutely positively hate it.  I wish i could just know the "you" that everyone else knows.  And that's all i have to say about that.  I hope everyone has a great nite, i luv u all to the max ;)  *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      The fragrance of a yellow rose Floating about the air, Reminds me of another time, And of a beauty so rare.  The melodic strains of an orchestra Wisping through the night, Remind me of another time, And so of a lovely sight.  Remembrance such as these Flood my thoughts with rhyme And I can not help but long for The song of another time.  A time when life made sense to me, When love was everywhere; When you and I would dance and dance While your fragrance filled the air.  Such memories consume me, And they constantly remind; That you, my sweet, are in my heart And forever on my mind.

      We used to be the best of friends But I think this is where it ends Every little thing I do isnt rite And every single time we start a fight You are the one trying to set me straight But i think u jus started a lil too late I'm pretty much too screwed up to fix Its pretty clear to me that u n i jus dont mix The title "best friends" jus isn't for u n me I guess it really wasn't meant to be In my mind, there's a different outlook There's no happily ever after like inna book It seems that you dont help to cure my confusion You're so called help is all an illusion Seems to me you're not in it to help me at all But to fulfill yourself; it's your "service call" Maybe "helping" me makes you feel better about you Or maybe im just totally wrong; it'd be nothin new All i kno is that's how i feel Dont really kno if thats the deal The way you help me...by putting me down And the day after, its the talk of the town Everyone knows the stuff i only tell you in confidence Im tryin to figure out how you can have such arrogance You think you can just go tell everyone? My thoughts, my dreams, my tragedies, stuff u shouldnt tell anyone Im sorry bud, but i finally snapped Can't take your shit nemore, feel like im trapped I'm always just a screw-up in your eyes At least thats what i feel like cuz im always the one who cries Well, all this came out cuz i ate a lot You wanted me to write? This is whatcha got.

       you left me here with nothing to lose.. and as i take it all back, i'd still take it from you.. and i'm writing the same words every time.. but i guess that never mattered to you..  and i'm sorry that it didn't quite work out this time.. so you can deal with your regrets, and i'll deal with mine.. and don't forget to call me when you 'make it.' and for now, i'll just think what i want..  this time, it's plain to see.. after everything, i will be the one who is left laughing.. and i hope that you meant it, everything you said.. you're too blind to see it going wrong again..  and i'm sorry that it didn't quite work out this time.. so you can deal with your regrets, and i'll deal with mine.. and don't forget to call me when you 'make it.' and for now, i'll just think what i want..  well don't tell me that it's nothing.. i can see it's killing you.. and i'll take every word you say as gospel - take it straight to heart.. and i hate you, but i love you, and i swear it doesn't matter.. and you're running away, screaming 'i can't take this'.. you beat me and you broke me, and now i'm falling down.. if i'm falling down, pretend you don't know.

      Well...last nite was the "funnest" time i've had in a long time.  As you all kno, it rained, and it rained hard.  Boy did that make for a perfect time. Me brad and mike, got out the crappy clothes, and went out and had a blast.  Played in the water forever...yeah it was freezing cold, but the fun definitely made up for it. wow, good time.  I dont kno how to explain it...it was just...fun.   If you could live your life all over again...would you?   My answer:  Yes, but i would change so many things.  I wouldn't make the mistakes i have made in the past, i dont think i would have changed certain relationships...i have all this stuff in my head rite now that i wanna write...but i can't put it into words...really wanna kno? ask me.  So would you live it all over again?  Leave a comment n tell me..or...just tell me.  *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      Memories concern Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safer in my room Unless I try to start again   I don't want to be the one Who battles always choose Cuz inside I realize That I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  Cultured my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before I have no options left again   I dont want to be the one Who battles always choose Cuz inside I realize That I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  I'll paint it on the walls Cuz I'm the one that falls I'll never fight again And this is how it ends   I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit tonight

      "Can you tell me what love is? Can you touch it or smell it? Is it something real like you or me? Does it solve our problems like a counselor or a judge? Have you ever lost someone that you loved? Have you ever loved someone more than your own life? Could you live with yourself when he left? Did it hurt more than you could control? Have you ever been in love? Do you know how it feels? Do you feel every second away from him? Have you longed for his touch? Do you live every day wondering what he does or if he is OK? Will you love him with all of your heart for as long as you shall live?"  -Anonymous

      I love life....and then i hate it...all at the same time. (yea, i dont really get it either.)  so today had many ups and downs.  Started off with a haircut.  Still not sure if i like it.  I'm pretty sure i dont, but w/e nothin i can do bout it nemore.  Then i went to the basketball carwash.  I took me about a total of 45 minutes to get there...from my house. The Cause:  Accident.  I'll explain...  Ok, so this white car goes thru a red light, another car hits it, tire comes lose, car loses control....heads towards a clan of 8th grade girls standing at the median.  So one girl tries to push the other out of the way.  Misses, and the corner of the sign goes into her shoulder. Bloody painful.  So then the car hits the other girl, sam, she flies in the air and then the car manages to also run her over.  The skin from her ankle to her knee was peeled off and her knee was basically facing a direction that it should not be facing.  She was able to talk to the officers and stay calm...after screaming for dear life in the beginning.  She was carried off in the ambulance...and all was...kind of ok.  Everyone was in shock.  But yeah, that would be the first bad part of the day.  Now, the good part:  Carwash was fun, but cold, i got to talk to milslagle.  I luv that guy, he is the sweetest man ever. He always makes me feel like im actually worth somethin in life. i love it.  haha and then...this girl who is working at subway randomly comes out.  She has a pen and a pad of paper in her hand and im just kinda wonderin what the hell.  So she walks up to me. Says hi, i say hi.  Then, she says, do you think i could have ur number?  Im thinkin, WTF mate?!  N then she continues with "this guy i work with is in there and he's been watchin you all afternoon and wants your number"  I obviously reply with a no.  So then she asks for a fake number just so he feels special.  I laughed gave her sum random number and she walked away.  Wow, funniest thing ever. loved it.  Then, after the carwash, i went home to change cuz i was cold and wet.  Then we headed over to susie's surprise party cuz she got her master's.  Holy shit, i swear the whole town of darboy was over there.  It was fun, for about the first 10 minutes.  Then jon managed to piss me off again.  So i remained pissed cuz he kept eggin me on and tryin to piss me off more and more...(which wasn't working)  So then, we're playin bocce ball or somethin gay like that and we were all by the muddy puddle.  Well, i have this large weighted ball in my hand...and jon is in the perfect place...hehe.  So i launch the ball perfectly and get him all full of mud and water.  Naturally his dad says now cara was that called for...and naturally i respond, yes ur son is a little asshole.  So then i left cuz i really dint wanna put up with his or ne1 elses shit...but before i leave the yard, goobs jumps on my back, whatta kid.  So yeah, i walk home.  Then...thank the lord.  Giesen calls.  Yessss.  So i do somethin w/him.  He picks me up...which is good cuz i was locked out newayz.  Stop to tell the parents where im goin n off we go.  We chilled at his house, watched a really wierd random movie.  It was a sweet one though.  So yeah, that was fun, then veta came over.  We watched the laker game and then after that came home.  I think overall...it was a good day, with just a few gay little things.  I think im lovin life again. fer now. O:-)  tata fer now  *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      Ok, well the previous blog was a little depressing.  But one thing has managed to cheer me up.  I made the paper! twice! two different papers.   Salm's hitting leads 'Makers to win over Wildcats        Sophmore infielder Cara Salm was a terror at the plate as the Kimberly softball team beat Oshkosh West 7-3 on Tuesday at Oshkosh.       Salm hit a triple, home run and drove in 5 runs to lead the 'Makers to the win.       Kimberly peppered the Wildcats with runs in four different innings.  Both teams had seven hits but the 'Makers bunched them together to score runs.   Kimberly      101   020   3 - 7  7  3  Osh. West     011   010   0 - 3  7  1 WP: Amy Rindfleisch. LP: Kara Krueger. Leading Hitters: Meghan Klein 2x2; Cara Salm 3x3, HR, 5 RBI.  i actually did something rite for a change. :-)

      What do you do when one best friend doesn't seem to be there anymore? What do you do when the other lives what seems like a million miles away, or more? What do you do when every day you keep diggin yourself a bigger hole to live in? What do you do if the only thing you want in life is for everything to be rite and the wrongs be forgiven? What do you do when you've lost the only true love in your life? What do you do when you dont kno  if you can make it thru all the pain and strife? What do you do when the only thing you want to do is cry every day n every nite? What do you do when the only wish that you have is that everything can finally be right?   *It's funny how when you go through a year nothing seems to change but when you look back everything is different*   I want everything to be  okay.  I'm sick of feeling like this.  I'm sick of feeling like i'm the last resort.  Like i'm only good enough when no one else is around or doing nething.  I'm trying to fight my emotions, i have been for the past 11 weeks, but u kno what, im not that strong, and i can't do it nemore.  I can't hold it in nemore. Emotionally, i'm weak, i can't help that, thats the way i was made.  I am me and if you dont like me, i guess thats ur loss, not mine.  And if you wanna surpass everything i feel, and everything that goes on in my life and act like its nothing, then fuck you.  You dont even kno half the shit that goes on.  Maybe cuz u dont care, or have better things to worry about, or maybe just because you're too lazy to listen.   All i gotta say is that no matter what you choose, i'm always gonna be here for you.  Cuz i kno what it is to be a true friend.   *Life Without Friendship Is Like The Sky Without The Sun*     Luv u always and forever,                        *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      I am so sick and tired of everything. Of life basically.  Everything is getting to me lately.  Wow, i jus can't stand it.  I cry over the dumbest stuff.  All i think about is u kno who.  I wish i could just cut off all ties w/him.  But i think that would hurt even more. I dont kno what i want nemore.  Friends?  Me? Have friends?  Doesn't really seem like it nemore.  The people i used to hang out with alll the time...it seems like they want nothing to do w/me, like i dont exist, and i dont kno what to do about it other than just let it be.  But its so hard, cuz now what am i supposed to do.  Yeah, i have ppl i talk to at school all the time, but come weekend....it's basically me sitting by myself at home, online, or watching tv, or something gay.  Someone should just shoot me now.  Or better yet, call me to do something.  k, im done venting now, sry for wasting your time.  *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons Finally content with a past I regret I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness For once I'm at peace with myself I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long I'm movin' on  I've lived in this place and I know all the faces Each one is different but they're always the same They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it They'll never allow me to change But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong I'm movin' on  I'm movin' on At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone There comes a time in everyone's life When all you can see are the years passing by And I have made up my mind that those days are gone  I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't Stopped to fill up on my way out of town I've loved like I should but lived like I shouldn't I had to lose everything to find out Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road I'm movin' on  I'm movin' on I'm movin' on  O:-) i luv life! and u of course! O:-)

      I can't give solutions to all of life's problems, doubts, or fears. But I can listen to you and together we will search for answers.  I can't change your past with all it's heartache and pain, nor the future with it's untold stories. But I can be there now when you need me to care.  I can't keep your feet from stumbling. I can only offer my hand that you may grasp it and not fall.  Your joys, triumphs, success, and happiness are not mine; Yet I can share in your laughter.  Your decisions in life are not mine to make, nor to judge; I can only support you, encourage you, and help you when you ask.  I can't prevent you from falling away from friendship, from your values, from me. I can only pray for you, talk to you, and wait for you.  I can't give you boundaries which I have determined for you, But I can give you the room to change, room to grow, room to be yourself.  I can't keep your heart from breaking and hurting, But I can cry with you and help you pick up the pieces and put them back in place.  I can't tell you who you are. I can only love you and be your friend.   *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      I have decided that i want to accept the responsibilities of an 8 year-old again.  I want to go to McDonald's and think its a four star restaurant.  I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud puddle to make a sidewalk with rocks.  I want to think M&Ms are better than money cuz u can eat em'.  I want to lie under a huge oak tree n run a lemonade stand w/my friends on a hot summer day.  I want to return to a time when life was simple; when all u knew were colors, multiplication tables, and nursery rhymes, but it didn't bother you, cuz u dint kno what u dint kno and u dint care.  All you knew was to be happy cuz u were blissfully unaware of all the things that should make you worried or upset.   I want to think the world is fair. That everyone is honest and good.   I want to believe that anything is possible.  I want to be oblivious to the complexities of life and be overly excited by the little things again.  I want to live simple again. I don't want my day to consist of computer crashes, mountains of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the month than there is money in the bank, doctor bills, gossip, illness, and loss of loved ones.  I want to believe in the power of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams, the imagination, mankind, and making angels in the snow.  *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      Too often we don't realize what we have until it is gone; Too often we wait too late to say "I'm sorry - I was wrong." Sometimes it seems we hurt the ones we hold dearest to our hearts; And we allow foolish things to tear our lives apart.  Far too many times we let unimportant things into our minds; And then it's usually too late to see what made us blind.  So be sure that you let people know how much they mean to you; Take that time to say the words before your time is through.  Be sure that you appreciate everything you've got And be thankful for the little things in life that mean a lot.  *~Cara Elizabeth~*

      Take a deep breath  Surrender all your fears Let everything flow from your fingertips And all drama avoid your ears Stop the tongue from gossipping The mind from wandering too far Let the world around you See you for who you really are  Take a deep breath now Surround yourself with friends Let love overcome your life Until everything suddenly ends Love your friends as they love you Treat them the way they should be Chill with them, hang with them Having fun with them is key  Don't let the world around you  Overcome you with all it's might Take a deep breath and stand up for yourself The best thing u can do is fight...   *~Cara Elizabeth~*              6-18-04

      From now on, my feelings and thoughts will be basically wrapped up in the words of quotes.  No names used, no people implied, just quotes...that's all i need...  "If you have reasons for loving someone, then you are using your mind, but if you love someone for no reason, then you are using your heart.”  "The most powerful phrase in the world is ‘I love you.’ Don’t abuse it."  "I don't want anyone else to get the chance to realize how amazing you are."

       He said 'cause he wanted someone to share his smile   To share the pain   To be there when the sea turns gray   To share the joy   For better or worse   And he thought that it mite have been me    &nbsp;  He wonders if i know   The way he saw my soul   Light up his life   He wonders if i know   Of the pain he feels tonite    &nbsp;  And i wonder if he knows   The strength it took me to say   We just can't be   I wonder if he knows   The piece of my heart it took from me.    &nbsp;  I care too much to let it go on   And think it's something that its not   Because what he feels for me   Is something that was taken some time ago   I just can't feel like that anymore    &nbsp;  And i wonder if he knows   That i truly do care   And that i wanna be his friend   And i always wanna be there    &nbsp;  'Cause I still wanna share my smile   Share the pain   Be there when the sea turns gray   Share the joy   For better or worse...    &nbsp;  ...this is just worse instead of better...    &nbsp;  *~Cara Elizabeth~*    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I'm sick of bein called a whore, i dont get it.  I don't do nething close to what most of the girls at our school do, or girls in society for that matter. I don't wear shirts that show half my chest, i rarely wear short short skirts, or even shorts.  I don't screw around w/guys.  Christ, i was w/the same person for almost a year. a year...whore's aren't with the same person for a year. They do shit with every guy in sight, n that's one thing i dont do.  Maybe u ppl who are talkn shit need to get ur facts straight.  I'm friends with a lot of guys, big frickin deal.  Just cuz im friends w/em doesn't mean i "get around"  Wow, seriously, some of you just need to mature a little.  And if im a whore, i dont wanna kno what sum other girls are...  i dont kno what else to say.  just next time before you open ur mouth, get ur facts straight, n dont talk shit about someone you dont even kno.  people just shouldn't have to deal with it.

      This is my 100th blog. how exciting....too bad you can't hear the excitement in my voice....(sarcasm) newayz....    Why Me?    .:Styx:.  I guess we used to be the lucky ones Good fortune smiled on everyone Stop A voice said you best beware Stop Bad luck is everywhere And sure enough the voice was right My luck changed overnight Stop Please tell me what went wrong Stop I can't take these ups and downs  Hard times come, hard times go And in between you hope and pray The scars don't show 'Cause life is strange and so unsure The days you hardly make it through You swear that there's a curse on you 'Cause nothing seems to fit And things won't go your way You know you've had enough You've got the right to say Why me, why me  Rubelator  Stop Here comes anxiety Stop Won't you please let me be, I need relief Hard times come, hard times go In between you hope and pray The scars don't show 'Cause life is strange and so unsure The days you hardly make it through You're sure that there is a curse on you If nothing seems to fit And things won't go your way You know you've had enough You can't take another day Where to go and what to do You've got those bills to pay You're really not alone you know 'Cause everybody says, Why me  Why me "Why me? That's what I want to know. You know what I mean? Huh. I don't know."

       Today, i got ta thinkin...something i really need to work on not doing as much.  But neways....i can't help but wonder why others get everything so good, like nothin could be better for them. and i get a whole lotta nothin. i mean...im not saying i have nothing nothing, im just saying....well...what did i ever do to not have happiness in my life, do i really deserve it? or is it someone's way of just having fun...to see me miserable.   i dont kno, i just see everyone w/that dose of happiness that i wish i had...but i havent had it in so long and im almost certain i won't have it for even longer, if ever. and i wanna kno why that is.  i just wanna be able to feel that feeling again...the way i'm supposed to, i wanna have someone to care about me and i can care about them in the same way..........i just....i wanna feel loved.  i want someone to go that little extra way to make me feel special. a small flower, a little note that lets me kno he's there, or even a small smile....anything to let me kno he's by my side.  i guess no matter how many friends i have, no matter how much my family cares about me, i'm always gonna have that hole in my heart....and feel that loneliness in my life....it ain't ever gonna go away...      How far do I have to go to make you understand, I wanna make this work so much it hurts       The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
