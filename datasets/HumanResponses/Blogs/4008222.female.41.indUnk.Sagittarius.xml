       I think it should be illegal to go to work on weekends. Having to work on a Saturday or Sunday is just plain wrong. :( The only good thing about having to work today is that I really like my job and most of the people I work with. Even the manager is very cool. I work in retail and I really like working with all the different people, even the nasty customers.      I work as a photo tech. And I really like it. I get to develop pictures and make reprints and enlargements and fun stuff like that. I love phototography anyway so this was the perfect job for me. I am alsways telling my husband that what other job do you know of where you can go around the world and never leave home?       I'm thinking of taking some photo classes at the college this winter. I really enjoy taking pictures and thought it might be fun to learn a few things.

       Went to St. louis today. Hubby and I had to take my mother in law to the airport and we spent the rest of the day there. We only live about an hour and a half from St. Louis but we rarely go there so this was a nice treat.    &nbsp;  We went to Union Station which is a shopping mall. It is very big. three stories tall, and the Hyatt Hotel is there also, right inside the mall. I had never seen that before.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Hard Rock Cafe is also there along with lots of stores, food vendors and restraunts.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;We also went to the St. Louis Arch which was very kool. the arch is huge. I was going to go up inside it but the line was very long and it was too hot to stand in line for so long. But it was kool to be able to be so close to it. They say that if you go up to the top you can see scross 4 states. Maybe some day I will see it.     &nbsp;

      Don't you hate it when you can't sleep? I do. It's almost 5 am in the morning and here I sit in front of the computer typing this. I even say my husband off to work which is rare since he has to leave so early. The only good thing is that I don't have to be at work til 2pm and have a chance to get some rest.  My two cats looked very offended when i truned on the light in the living room. I don't think they were too happy with me. :)  &nbsp;

       &nbsp;My very first blog.   &nbsp;Not too sure what to write about so I'll tell you about my two cats. Their names are Harmony and Baby and they are totally spoiled.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;Harmony thinks she's a dog because she actually plays fetch and brings the toy back to you and lays it at your feet. Not a typical cat, at least none that I have seen have done this. She is also one big bundle of energy, always on the go, never stopping and when she does sleep, I think she is recharging her batteries not really sleping.   &nbsp;Baby on the other hand is your typical run of the mill cat. She does three things in her comlicated life, eat use the litter box and sleep. She is very quiet and loves to lay with you on the couch and will let you pet her for hours.   &nbsp;Both cats have very diffrent personalities and I wouldn't change one of them. They are both very precious to me and my husband.

      Decided against going to the fair today and opted to just stay home and do nothing. I figured it was ok to be lazy today and so just watched tv and played on the computer today. Hubby did the same thing. It was kinda nice to not do anything but sit around.  Hubby has to go to work tomorrow while I have one more day off. Not sure what I'm going to do tomorrow, maybe sleep in a bit. I really should clean a bit but who would want to do that. LOL.

      The concert was awesome! Loved every minute of it and it was crowded. I was really surprised to see a lot of young kids there. There were lots of people my age there also and that was kool. I knew almost every song and sang right along with them. I had a great time. I hadn't been to a concert in ages and this was a lot of fun. Went back to the fair today to enjoy the rest of the fair. I had a gyro instead of my usual Philly steak and cheese and it was good. I love gyros with lots of extra sauce. I might go back tomorrow to get some more pics and to just walk around. It's a great place to people watch and there are lots of free shows and concerts. The atmosphere is what I like and hey it's only once a year. I can't believe day two of my four days off are coming to a close. Time goes by so fast. It's a bummer but what can you do? One cannot hold back time, but can only enjoy each day as it happens.

      I got to go home early from work today!!! :) 7:30 to be precise. When I was told I could leave early if I wanted to they didn;t have to tell me twice. LOL! I am now officially starting my much deserved and payed 4 days off.  I have the concert on Sunday night, and I am going back to the fair Monday and not sure what I'm going to do for tuesday or Thursday, but I know it won't be work. Don't get me wrong, I love my job but it's always nice to get away for a while.   I had to train a new person today. While I don't mind doing that, It does get frustrating, as you have to slow down, go at their pace and keep remembering that they are new and that you once was also and have lots and lots of patience. I think he is going to work out fine as he is catching onto everthing really quickly. He just needs to have some self confidancee that he can do it by himself and do it correctly. I told him this afternoon that we all make mistakes but that is how we learn. He will do fine. He is closing tonight and I ahve shown him how a dozen or so times and the Mananger is there to help him should he have trouble. Either way, i'll hear about it on Thursday.

       Work yesterday sucked. It was so dead in the store. I know I should not complain about work being slow but if you have nothing to do then 8 hours can drag on and on. It was awful. but then again it did get kinda cold out yesterday so maybe that's why peole were not shopping. Just a guess. I hope today is better. Don't get me wrong, I don't like crazy busy days, but somewhere in between. A steady pace. Can't have everything I guess.      I only have to work today and tomorrow and then it's a four days off for me! :) I don't have to go back to work until Thursday and  I plan to make the most of my days off. i have the concert on Sunday night, the state fair on Monday, and I'm sure I'll be doing something on Tusday and Wednesday as I do not plan on wasting four days off. I'm not that dumb. LOL!

       yesterday's trip to St. Louis was uneventful except the hour it took to go a little over a mile and a half. I really really really hate road construction.  It was crazy. Backed up for ever it seemed. We just barely made it to the airport ahead of my mother in law.  But we did make it so all is ok. :)       Looking forward to the weekend. The state fair is starting up on Friday, and while the fair itself doesn't really change, the Styx/Kansas concert should be kool and the food at fairs are some of the best around. The state fair makes the best darn philly steak and cheese I have ever tasted and nothing beats a fair corndog. Makes me hungry just thinking about it.    I also took four days off from work to go to the fair and get some stuff done around the house, though that may never happen. I have the best of intentions on cleaning, but then something distracts me and it doen't get done.  But I'm really going to make an effort to clean. Not that my house isn't clean mind you, It's just more cluttered then I would like. I have more stuff then space. If I was smart I would get rid of some stuff but I have to admit I am a bit  of a packrat. Hey you never know when you's going to need something.

       It's back to St. Louis today to pick up my mother in law from the airport. It's hard to believe that two weeks have already gone by. I swear the days go by faster and faster. I mean, we are already in the second week of August already.   We might go to the St. Louis Zoo today for a bit if my mother in law isn't too tired. I know she likes the zoo and we don't get to St. Louis often. I like it there. There is tons more to do tehn here in Springfield, things more exciting and fun. All we have are Abe Lincoln sites and the State Fair which starts on Thursday.    Speaking of the fair, I'm going to my first concert in years. I'm going to go see STYX and KANSAS on Sunday. Talk about memories of the good olld old days. LOL. they are playing back to back on the same ticket in the grandstand and I have tickets. A kid at work didn't even know who Kansas was. I had to laugh, then realized how old I must be getting. OH well, still two great bands. Or they used to be anyway. We shall see.   On my way to breakfast, see ya.:)
