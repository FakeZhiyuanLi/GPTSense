						       I have turned my porch into "Anytown USA". My tastes and love for life are well beyond the personality of this neighborhood...  it's the ghetto.  Actually it's the grey between the black of the ghetto and the white of suburbia.  So I am fighting the grey by adding some  color .  Red, white and blue!  I am 13th generation American and love the simple times of the old west.  So in the heart of my pit bull biting, bass thumping neighborhood I have created a Kramer inspired  Anytown USA .  Three hanging impatient plants, one bird feeder, one recovering potted plant sharing soil with an American Flag, a white glass table with a wool flower cover which holds my Weber charcoal grill.  I grilled steaks out there yesterday while wearing my Iron Chef apron... and I threw some hickory wood chips on the coals for one more level of spite.  I hope it was a nauseating site.  "Ya'll come back real soon!"

						      I was listening to talk radio while getting ready for the day.  The host had a caller on who was a homosexual.  He had called in because he and his partner had tried to get a marriage license in response to our Representatives announcement. He announced that he found nothing in state law that would prohibit homosexual couples who had been  married  in Massachusetts, where it is now legal, to be recognized as  married  in Rhode Island, where it is  not  legal.  First of all, I have no idea how Massachusetts suddenly became its own dictatorship, because I do know that the majority of the people, when this subject was voted upon, voted against homosexual marriage.  And this is just how this madness is going to spread.  Our forefathers missed it, and I mean that as a resounding compliment.  They didn't have it within themselves to think so wretchedly as to ever conceive the notion of same-sex marriage.  The furthest they could allow themselves to digress was incestual marriage and even bestiality!  So I exhausted the state laws myself only to discover the only clause that could possibly be used against this was on public health safety in regards to sexually transmitted disease. I feel so frustrated!  Where is our Godly President!? This Country is slowly becoming and in many ways already is a dictatorship ruled by corrupt judges.  If he is not careful he is going to wake up one morning powerless.  I am not going to sit around and let this happen!  It is such a slap in the face to the men and women of our Country who bled and died for a Nation they believed in.  A Nation founded on Godly principles.  The liberals know that a nation that does not know its past is bound to repeat it.  They want anarchy so that they will be  forced  to step in to control us for our own good. The last stage of decay of a society, as history has proven time and again, is the widespread acceptance of homosexuality.  This fight is not about equal rights, itâ€™s about making sure we don't have any. Massachusetts has a long battle ahead of them.  We need to start our own battles while one of the largest threats are distracted.  I made an email survey that databases people's opinions on same-sex marriage.  The results will be sent to our state representative.  If you happen to be reading my diary and are interested in getting one of these surveys for your state... email me franklinsauders@hotmail.com.

						       "He that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that sows to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life."  ~Galatians 6:8   I am always amazed at how I can so often meditate on this scripture, yet more often sow to my flesh. I always pray that God's will be done in my life, secretly hoping I will hear a booming voice from Heaven calling me to riches and glory. But then I hear that still small voice calling me to humbly sow to the spirit.  I have to be in the right frame of mind and heart to hear a still small voice, and it seems like the majority of the time I am distracted by things that take up headroom. I have learned that sowing to the spirit is a journey, we are to  seek  the face of God... but seeking entails setting out, being patient, and working through the discourgement of possibly not finding.  God reveals Himself to me by promising that He hears my cry.  I just have to discern the rabbit trails I do find along the way, that seem so promising, and make sure they don't stop me from pursuing my ultimate goal... no matter how daunting the road I know I should be traveling appears.

						      Dreamed last night that I found rare coins with Harrison Ford's head on them.  Some were large Gold coins and some small copper and silver.  One had him as Han Solo and another as Indiana.  Right next to the coins was a zippo with a picture of him in a cheesy "before he was famous" sci-fi show.  He was wearing the worste costume I have ever seen and his shirt read something like  The Starship Plus .  Incidently, while I was picking up the coins in my dream, my mother in-law's impish friend was takin' a pee in my dog's water bowl, while my wife packed her mother's bags in tears because we were taking her to prison. Freud, you were saying?

						      Today I went to the Museum of Fine Arts to see Paul Gaugin's Tahiti exhibit.  It was inspiring to say the least.  I am a new Gauguin admirer.  What sparked my interst in him was a three hour documentary I watched on PBS about Gauguin and Van Gogh's relationship. Van Gogh is my favorite post-impressionist artist and I, ironically, had heard Michael Savage talk about Gauguin's work,  The White Horse , the night before on the radio.  That was the first time I have heard of Gauguin.  When I woke up the next morning and turned on the televsion, the documentary was on. And because I had planned to research Gauguin that day... I counted it fate. It is the only time the exhibit will be seen in the USA until it returns to Paris, so it was a must see.  Gauguin is considered to be the most innovative artist of the post-impressionist era... a bridge to a new way of seeing the world.  One link I have discovered in every great piece of artwork whether it be music, art or writing is a  sense of spiritual longing, a sweet sadness perhaps...  a longing that lives in the deepest part of every man... a crying out.  Gauguin portrayed this longing in every painting, especially the paintings he painted in Tahiti near the end of his life.  He was always searching for a simpler life, he hated the modernization of France which is why he left for Tahiti.  Much to his dismay, when he arrived in Tahiti, he found that France had beat him there.  Missionaries had set up camp in attempt to convert the Tahitians, but Gauguin viewed it as a different form of modernization that attacked the culture itself, destroying it's mythology and replacing their gods.  It was obvious to me why he went to Tahiti... God called him.  He placed himself in the heart of a missions camp.  Meanwhile, Tahitians were being converted left and right.  Gauguin resented it his entire life.  In his last few years his paintings went from bright vibrant colors to a more subdued even dark pallette.  His paintings were fittingly tiltled,  Where Are We Going?, Where do we come from?, What are we?  he painted a series of paintings based on these titles before creating his masterpiece.  He set out to paint a large work (375 x 175cms) that would be a culmination of his life's work.  The masterpiece entitled  Where are we going? What are we? Where do we come from?  appears above.  It deals with birth, life and death.  It is a sad portrayal of death from Gauguin.  This is a painting from someone who had desperately searched for truth only to turn up empty-handed when it was most needed.  He planned to commit suicide when he had completed the painting.  He drank arsenic before he was finished but only became ill.  After recovering, he then reutrned to his painting and completed it.  It was just as he hoped it would be... life changing.  But the exhibit was more than a show of paintings... it was a diary of one man's search for eternal life.  It has to be so immensely difficult to find anything that requires looking beyond yourself when you are given a gift of his magnitude.  You can tell by the way he lived and the way he treated his relationships that he was a very selfish and extremely prideful man.  The Bible says that it is easier for a camel to pass through the  eye of the needle  than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  It is easy to think soley of people with monies when reading the word "rich", but that also includes people rich in talents and in thought.  Gauguin, was quitter... a quitter rich in talents.  When the going got tough in his famliy... he abandoned them.  When the going got tough in France... he blamed it on modernization and moved to Tahiti.  When things got mundane in Tahiti... he moved back to France.  When he had no success selling his Tahitian paintings in France... he moved back to Tahiti to "live out the rest of his days."  When he arrived he vowed that if nature did not "do the job" he would take matters into his own hands... so he attempted suicide.  The more I think about it, the more I realize that he never really  truly  searched for what he pusued his entire life.  He was content listening to himself talk and by painting clever metaphors.  But if he had looked beyond himself... even in his very own village, he would have found that he was "searching for fool's gold in a silver mine."  Although he seemed to be interested in the mythological gods of the Tahitians, he knew "they" were religion on his terms... he knew they would demand nothing of him.  He saw  that the missionaries in Tahiti were  challening  the very core of an established "truth" and the ones (Tahitians) who had lived it and believed for centuries were listening.  He was scared to the core.  His speeches on the negativity of modernization were an excuse... plain and simple.  Even the word modernization screams out "you will be challenged and you must rise to it to succeed!"  From a worldy aspect he is an extraordiary success, but in the big picture his life is a sad portrait of a gifted man who almost "got it"... but never rose to the challenge.  In one of his last paintings, there is a white cross in a distant graveyard on a hill reflecting the rays of a sunset.  Because Gauguin filled his works with symbolism and meaning, I like to think this was his way of saying he had made peace with the God of the missionaries and that he had caught a ray of hope reflecting from the truth he had regarded as out of reach.  I purchased a copy of his "Where are we going?" masterpiece and hung it over my work space as a gentle and beautiful reminder to stay focused on what matters... and that the sort of legacy left by a  brilliant  quitter...  is a moment of awe and a pity nod.

						      I had my first day of classes today.   Scoring for Full Orchestra  with famed composer Vuk Kulenovich.  He is very hard to understand because of his accent... full of tastey foreign ingredients.  My first impression, I fear, was lacking.  I always want to prove myself to the teachers I admire... one of my flaws.  He asked a question directly to me... "Vut es the furst recourd of tonality en musak?"  That is what I heard... who knows what he actually asked.  So, while trying to decipher his exact words, while attempting to pluck the right word, which I knew ( Renaissance ), from my brain,  while  dealing with the pressure of empty air space and an approaching cricket chirp... I blurted out  "Monks!"  I would have been so embarassed for the person who gave this answer... but alas, twas me! Another student who had  time  to think, unpressured, gave the answer which was on the tip of my brain.  Vuk was not too pleased with my answer... he even did that French fake spit gesture with his mouth.  Oh well, he is an amazing teacher and there is plenty of time to redeem myself and to prove that I  am  the best composer in his class.  Who knows... maybe he will cry out "Genius!" and beg me to be his student... maybe for the right price. ;)

						      There is a homeless man in Boston I pass daily.  He is constantly trying to feed his invisible duck with my money.  (Pause: Notice the lack of quotation marks around invisible duck... no mistake.)  Unfortunately his invisble duck is not a metaphor for his... "lack of bills".  He honestly thinks he has a pet invisible duck... I know this because the eyes, as you know,  are  the "window to the soul" and I swore I caught a glimpse of somekind of fowl... could have been a chicken.... who knows? Anyway, I just smile as I walk by, making sure the change in my pocket is secure enough against my thigh to not jingle,  I know he'd just spend it on booze anyway... poor duck.  But during my walk today, an enchanting sound fell upon my ears.  It was the purest whistling I have ever heard.  I looked around expecting to see Snow White surrounded by fuzzy woodland creatures, but instead found the homeless man staring, with a sweet lamentful longing at a piece of string he was fondling  while  whistling his heart out.  Then the wind ... started blowing and ... blew something into my eye ... causing it to tear up... I swear!  Anyway, I continued enjoying this transient free melody when I realized this homeless psychopath had not missed a note or had even slid into a note for that matter... he had perfect pitch and I ... I didn't ... I MEAN, HOW ELSE COULD SOMEONE WHISTLE THAT ... THAT ... STUPENDOUSLY!!!   (breathing heavy) So... out of spite I jotted down the catchy melody he was whistling (which, oddly, was better than anything I have heard from a fellow conservatory student) and will one day use it to make millions, from which the whistler will get NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHIIIIINGGGGG!!!  becasue he has perfect pitch and I don't... and I will have ... TWO invisible ducks... COUNT EM'... TWO!!! BWHAHAHA... BWHAHAHAHAH.... BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!  FREAK!

						      I had a  moment  tonight while eating a meatball.  I have this thing with my dog S.A. where I constantly ask myself for meatballs with her little doggy voice. I imagine that if I were a dog... a big ball of meat would be my "vu le luv" (that's french for, "You obviously don't know how to speak french either.") Ya... anyway, while eating the meatball, I made eye contact with "ASS.A", as I call her, and had a bolt of... reality?  Sitting there before me, begging for a ball o' meat, on my wooden floor, in a house, in a state, in a country (God Bless America!), in a planet, in a solar system, in a majestic galaxy, in a wondrous universe, created by an almighty supreme being whom could destroy all with a mere twitch... drools a *F.O.A.M.C.L, limping... yet  very  loveable beast whose sole purpose in exisiting is the unbridled desire for a ball of meat and a... as I watch her now... to "moondance" on my carpet with her bum... oh wait...  and lick the leftovers. "'Doggy' bag?" ... The Supreme Being obviously has a sense of humor, and at the expense of my Saxony... it's His anyway. Um... in closing, if I may... bring it all back around by paraphasing Proverbs 26:11, "A smelly carpet... builds  character ."  A(h)men.   *Face Only A Mother Could Love
