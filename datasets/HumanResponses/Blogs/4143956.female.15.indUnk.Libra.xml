      hmmz... today was okae. except i really wasnt feeling well after school for a while. -_- even broke out in cold sweat.. -_-" but i was fine. and i still am! praise God..   i finally got down to doing the revision thingy in the e-math textbook.. goodness the 7.2 one i super super long i tell you. 38 questions, most of which have parts from (a) to (z).. man..  but yeah. i guess if i really tried i could do it. i've only completed two so far though. but at least i tried and got started.. i'm still a little blur bout a-math relative velocity thingy. that is just plain gross.. *sigh* but what to do.. just have to force my brain to absorb all the information it can.  i'm just glad that it'll all be over soon. people.. remind me to push myself to study yah. thanks. if not i'll just slack. i'm here only because i had to reply a very important e-mail ok.. not because i'm too free.   the moment i reached home i went to bathe then sat down to study lah.. amazing i think, for someone like me to actually do that. really praise God! but at least i finished in time to catch singapore idol and get some load off my chest. that really felt good. oh my hat.. that whispering guy.. hopeless..  worse still the one who tried to do some techno thingy.. whatever he was trying to sing, he sure gave it a bad name. gosh.. it was plain horrble save a handful of exceptions. really pitied the judges.. and gurmit singh has a good voice. :)  anyways.. i jst applied for leave from choir.. for prelims and 'o's.. sigh.. one less thing to look forward to in my week. :( but i hope it wont be that bad. and i just know that i'll be needing all the time i can get.  but then again one good thing is that i'll be able to sit at the teenzeal area with my gang again! :) woohoo! really miss you precious people..   haha one last thing before i go and sleep. (i need rest) desmond, the lyrics.. (sorry i took so long yah.. was studying)   (REALLY)  into Your hand i commit again all i am for You Lord You hold my world in the palm of Your hand and i am Yours forever  Jesus i believe in You Jesus i belong to You You're the reason that i live the reason that i sing (with all i am)  i'll walk with you whereever You go through tears and joy i'll trust in You and i will live in all of Your ways Your promises forever  i will worship i will worship You(x4)  yup yup! :) finally yah.. :) hee.. i live to worship my King of Glory. He has saved me. i'll forever sing His praise. because He loves me! i'm free! hallelujah!  haha okies anyways i gotta go yah. :) anyone want any lyrics just e-mail or sms me lah. or you can call my phone! (only 7am to 7pm) muahaha... the joys of free-incoming.. yeah.. be blessed all!  soaring over mountains of defeat for He carries me on eagles wings, ~BOK~

      man... woke up feeling so giddy i couldnt even walk straight. then i went back to sleep and woke up again at 1030hrs. felt so weird. haha woman was late for lecture.. -oopx- yeah anyways... was studying all the way since after washing up.. so very sorry to those who tried calling. :)  happy birthday Jo! love you v much!   haha i cant wait for Gig3!gonna be one of the best gigs ever.. just have this feeling. so cool! and so what if its in the middle of my prelims... :) that's not going to change the fact that i will have fun and enjoy myself, and of course it wouldn't change the fact that my Daddy is going to be there! :) oh man.. He just loves me SO much!! =D  you know.. when i first got back my results for chinese, i was super disappointd. i was like, what?! c5?! then i felt so gross.. but i failed to realize that actually that grade was already very good. considering i have been failing since sec3.. i was so disappointed, so reliant on my flesh, that i even forgot to praise Him for giving me a distiction for oral/listening(which i SO did NOT deserve).. frankly speaking, i didnt even deserve the c5 grade!i really deserved to fail.   the reason why i got the grades i got is all out of His great love for me. i mean, who gets distinction for oral when you stumble on 3/4 of all the words in the passage and say 1/2 the words wrongly? haha.. i think i'm the only one. that just goes to show how great my God is.. He uses the things that are not to not the things that are! :)   well, so for those of you who didnt do as well as you wanted to for whatever thing it is.. just remember. you dont even deserve the grades you are currently getting, what more the grade you want. you get good grades not because of you or what you have done. you get good grades because Jesus gave you the good grades. He is merciful and He loves you. praise Him in spite and despite of all your circumstances. in any case, He is a good God. the goodest of all. :)   -doosh-  my brother shaved his head...  now i feel like cutting hair too.. not really cutting as in cutting short but like.. haha aiyah... nvm.  goodness whats wrong with her? just because someone ELSE put her in a bad mood she has to take it all out on ME. sigh... oh well. i didnt blow up at her at least. thank God. He really has something great in store for our relationship amen.. and the devil's afraid of that. that's why he's attacking it so much.. hallelujah. Daddy is my patience. how can i be rude to her when she's God's beloved? and how can i not forgive her when she's just as forgiven as i am?   Lord.. thank You for Your mercies, thank You for Your grace. thank You for loving me. thank You for everything. You are my life, i live for You.  soaring over mountains of defeat, because He carries me. ~BOK~

      okae i hereby officially announce.. i'm feeling quite high again. haha.. :) also dunnoe why lah. joy of the Lord amen.. :) so happy with my new song.   haha just heard the news. ronald susilo has gotten quite far yah.(for those who blur, he's a badminton player yah) then i was like, wow... singapore? haha then after awhile i realized. oh yah.. susilo's not singaporean... hee..  ok so i'm mean but its quite true wad.. :) anyway.. just remembered.. a few days ago, i heard a fren saying that he would dedicate his time to church when he did have the time, or when he was free-er.  then i was thinking.. it doesnt matter whether you actually have the time or not. if you really want to serve God and you know beyond the shadow of a doubt what you're serving for, then everything will work out itself.  'for all things work together for good, to those who love Him, and to those who are called according to His purpose.'  see.. He will make time for you when you give Him our time. in fact, He will use your giving Him time as an excuse to bless you! see how good our Father in heaven is.   haha in any case.. i realized its quite late. and i'm serving 1st and 2nd tmw.. or should i say later... :) yup then.. off i go!  with love, ~BOK~ *bok does a dance of delight* *twirls about a bit* *thinks to herself,"why am i doing this?" *now bok prepares to go offline, then sleep*

      gosh... today i took my 'o' level english oral exams. man.. i thought they'd set better questions than that. who knew..   when i started reading the stupid passage, it was okae.. at first. until i reached the line 'i have been a clown for ten years now'... SIGH..  but i was like, okae, that's not so bad.. at least i didnt see one.so yeah.. read read.. all about the hard and pathetic life of a clown. (haha sry shawn.. no offense to your fren).. i was like, see.. it never pays to be a clown.  then, when i turned over to look at the stupid picture, wonder of all wonders!!! :) didnt noe if i should have laughed or cried. (just fyi, i didnt do any of those two things) oh my hat. when i turned the page, there was this super horrible freaky clown staring right in my face. like hello!! is cambridge stupid or wad? nothing better to set? why of all things must set on clowns?? oh man.. the worst set of oral questions ever. -doosh-  my immediate reaction was to flip the page over again so that i wudnt be looking at the stupid clown. haha got a weird stare from the time-keeper..  -_-'' so i was like, sheesh.. act natural! act atural! ya but too bad i already caught his attention.. and for the rest of the time i was sitting there he kept giving me weird glances. *sigh*   however, it then dawned on me that if i didnt look at the stupid picture with the stupid clown, i wudnt be able to plan my answer.. *sigh* so what to do.. i had no choice but to face that ass-clown for the next ten minutes.. (haha if ur wondering whether ass-clown is the clown or the time-keeper, i'd say its both) =D   anyways.. back to my point. the stupid clown.. he didnt even look like he was enjoying himself. so i said he looked bored and whatever, substantiating my answers, the like.. talked so much crap.. haha i didnt give the examiners a chance to speak! haha think the examiners got sick and tired of hearing about clowns, so we moved on to conversation.  by the way, my examiners.. gosh. it was quite hilarious, come to think of it. the woman looked as if the whole world owed her a living while the man(woman.. it?) was so gay. i mean, try imaginig this skinny guy sitting cross legged(i mean like the girls kind of cross leg).. then with his hands on his knees. *puke*  ya anyways.. where was i~ ya.. so we moved on to converesation. 'take for example you were a teacher. do you think this job would make you bored?' so i went blah-ing away.. blah blah.. then they were like, smile abit at certain points..   then next question. 'what job, other than teaching, would you enjoy and not get bored with?' so like at that very instant i forgot how to say the word veterinarian.. -_-'' so i was like, 'erm..

      haha okae this isnt the thigy i wanted to share but its still important that everyone should know. muahaha!!  saints won the sandcastle building competition!!! muahahahax! and it was really praise God, cos when we first started out the whole group of eight had no idea what to do. we didnt even know how to start.   but then we just left it to Daddy.. and there.. we won. :) ok i'm not saying that the other groups didnt trust god or anything, but this is just an example. that God cares even for the littlest and most un-important details of your life. i mean, how important is a sandcastle?  yup.. He really loves us alright. :) haha and the best part was that each and everyone of us had a really great time, and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. :) we had so much fun, and our time was just so blessed. :) Daddy binds our frenships amen. :) i feel i got alot closer to alot of pple ytd. :) prasie God.  anyways.. i really have to go now. :)  His precious daughter, ~BOK~  p/s: by the way, the prizes were great! thanks to all the Teenzeal leaders and those who helped plan the outing! it was great! be blessed, all!

      i just read some pples bloggies.. dunno lah this gy from m'sia somehow found my bloggie and left a comment with his addy.. so i went to visit. and read thru some of his frens bloggies too.   well, it really saddens me that so many pple out there in this God-given world dont know the true grace of God. like how they still beg for forgiveness every night and stuff.   left some super long comments there. :) and 'preached' myself happy as usual. :) and man.. it just dawned on me how much God loves me. i mean, not that i really can know, but... aiyah u noe wad i mean lah. :) like, how He died just so i could live.. when actually my existence isnt really of much worth. and that He went thru 'hell' just so i could enjoy heaven on earth. He took my pain so that i wouldnt have to suffer. He took my curse so that i could be blessed. wow~  is that a great God or what? haha i think He's more what.. cos its like indescribable. =D   another comment on one of those bloggies was that "sometimes God still gives sickness and disease to punish us". whoa... and how ironic that the line before said "all good things are from God, and all bad things from the devil". and these are from the SAME person.   gosh. people are confused.. so i left another super long comment lah. haha.. just felt like i had to share the good news. people need the Lord, and i'm just wondering when and how long they'll take to realize that fact.   sometimes it does make me wonder whether those who are taught grace take grace for granted. that would really be sad. and it also dawned on me how important prayer is, tho it isnt the thing that changes circumstances and all.   anyway, praise God my mom got her voice back after totally losing it(i have no idea how) about 2 day ago. wow that was fast.. :) and one more sad thing.. :( i have a tan line... :( on my shoulders... :( bleah.. oh well.. haha. guess that's inevitable when you're at the beach. and when u cycle in the hot sun for i-have-no-idea-how-long. haha. my butt hurts now..  oh wells.. there isnt choir prac tmw. they decided to give us a break. :( which means only one more prac to go before i'm on leave.  :( i'll miss choir.. really.   oh my hat... i wanted to say something.. but it just slipped my mind.. ah.. (makes frustrated valen sound) LoLx.. (sry arh babe) its just farni. i'll blog again when i rmb it. :)  okae then.. i have to go eat my din-dins.. :)  righteous in Christ, ~BOK~  p/s: that persons bloggie is  http://gobblogblog.blogspot.com/      yupx..       pp/s: sigh... i still cant rmb what i wanted to say... -_-"

      sometimes i dont know anymore.. whether pple are in a ministry to know pple and be known, or whether they're really in it for God. and its quite sad.. cuz like.. the reason why we even exist is Jesus. He is the air we breathe.  serve Him cos He loves us, not because.. 'just because'. that's a lousy reason to be serving. in fact, if you really think that way, then i feel that you shudnt be serving at all.   pple shud get their priorities staight. i mean.. that's just how i personally feel lah.. its no point doing something 'for' God when the focus isnt even on Him. then it'll just be empty works. it wouldn't be as powerful or fruitful as you'd haf wanted it to be.  maybe i'm just too sensitive.. but that's just what i've been feeling lately. i'm not saying i'm right.. but somehow i just haf this feeling that pple are starting to lose their focus on God.. like, i think their just too caught up in other stuff.   like for me, i've learnt never to belittle myself you know. whatever it is, God has a plan for my life, a purpose for me. one that only i can fulfill. its my calling. noone can walk it out but me. if He has called me to do something, then i'll do it. and not out of self pride or other foolish reasons. but plainly because i know that He loves me. He gave me that special calling because He loves me and knows that i will enjoy doing what He has called me to do.   it wudnt matter what pple think or say, whether against me or for me. nothing matters except God. He is the reason i live, the reason i sing. He is my reason.  i am more precious to Him than heaven. He left there to be in my heart. he feeds the birds and clothes the lilies. how much more me, Hos precious beloved daughter.. i'm always reminded that whatever i do, i should always look to Jesus. He is the alpha and the omega. the author and finisher of my life. its never over until He says it is.  even if i dont get what i want when i want it, it wouldnt matter. even if the whole world goes against me it wouldnt matter. cos i still have Him, and that's all that matters in the end. and anyway challenges only mean that its gonna get better. Daddy will restore a thousand times more! plus the fact that my now is so beautiful.. made beautiful by God Himself. :) so no matter what happens, i dont really care. i'm just gonna enjoy, cos He's given me the right to do so.  rejoice pple. your God is for you. noone can be against you!  ~BOK~

      why does my dad haf to be so mean? what, he thinks violence and all is really going to help? its not going to solve anything lah. in fact it'll just make it worse.   i mean.. you dont go and ahout at your son at 11pm for the whole neighbourhood to hear. pls lah.. pple want to slp one. why cant he be a little nicer?   okae. so my brother does have an attitude problem. but may i suggest its only because his father cares more about everything else than the family? wudnt that make it his fault?  what, he thinks just cos he's a big guy means he can do anything? what's with the threats anyway? it doesnt scare us. i dont care if he really does punch me or my brother in the face anyway. its not going to change anything, except make us hate him more. fine, strangle us, slap us in the face. what do i care???  anyway everything else matters more. what's family to him? wud it make a difference whether we were living with him or not? frankly i think not. since he always wants to ounch us in the face.. ha! maybe one day he shud just do it. then i'd know that at LEAST he's a man of his word.  well actually is he a real man? hah. i dont really think so. what husband doesnt look after his wife when she's sick? what father threatens to smash in his kids face? hello even animals dont do that.(even if they do that's not the point.)  what is wrong with this man? he's not the father i once knew. argh!! what is he like having menopause or what? even then dont take it out on my brother. or me for that matter. hello we did NOT cause his menopause..(if it is lah)   gosh he made ah boy cry kae. who makes aaron bok cry?? noone! he's just damn mean lah! my brother never cries ok. i'm serious. what is wrong with this father?   i cant blame my brother for not believing that God is such a great Father. like, with this kind of dad.. F***(sry) sheesh and i cant help him. i cant do anything but pray. and feel helpless. i hate this. hate this hate this hate this. shit.  aiyer what's wrong with him lah..its not like any amt of shouting will make my brother be obedient. even IF it really works..it'll be out of fear, not love. shucks lah.  God why??? sob. i just need him to be a LITTLE bit more concerned about us. you noe.. like to just show us abit more love or wadeva. what his heart diamond arh?? got problem.. sheesh.   i hate it when this happens. which is unfortunately.. ah never mind. gosh.. man cant he smile when he's at home? i;m not even asking him to laugh or talk to us nicely.. just smile for God's sake! smile! argh! feel like pulling out all my hair! but then again that wudnt help much.   sigh... oh wells... one day.. he'll be worshipping. ... i pray... exhale. i shud just forget about it.  sigh... ~BOK~
