      I have potential. Do you have potential? I've heard it all my life. It's like the word describes everything I do. It isn't really a good word. It means that you are stuck in this perpetual state of almost. You almost make the team. You almost get the question right. You almost represent the perfect example to your kids. You are almost the best friend. I really don't like being full of potential. It has plagued me my whole life. The message seems to be that I'm not quite what God had intended. But whose message is it that I'm hearing? Is it my message? Is it the message that my family wants to send or my collegues are sending me? Is the message even worth listening to? Is the message even true? Is the message from God?   What is the message that you are telling yourself? Do you recognize that it is the same everytime that you find yourself wondering why you are here? It is interesting that I've just asked so many questions! But I do not know how else to express the importance of understanding what is really going on in your life. We spend so much time reacting, living, doing. We spend little time conciously making choices about what message to listen to and what convictions to form. We spend too much time contemplating our selves. Do you get that?   Do you get that looking inside yourself does not solve the problem of what is going on? We are surrounded by the gurus that say do it yourself. That is the message we are feeding our pyches. The message is being spewed out by the media, the gurus, the leaders, pop culture, in music, and maybe even your neighbor.   I grew up in a culture that said “You are woman, do whatever you want.” I listened. And I did. If I - someone from a Christian home, pastor for a father, a wonderful mother, and an extended family that cared about me - still listened to the wrong message, then so will some of our children. Even though _____.... you fill in the blank. I no longer believe that do whatever you want, is the right message. It is much more complicated than that.   I’ve noticed something. People are searching. No, I’m serious. I’m sure you’ve heard that before, but really, they are. You Christians out there - Don’t you ever hear something on TV, the radio, in a song, or standing in line somewhere, and you just want to scream “JESUS CAN FIX THAT!” We all know it’s not that simple. If you’re talking with a friend and they have a problem, a pat answer of “Jesus can fix that” can pretty much end the conversation. Even those of us that can call ourselves followers of Christ are not sold on the “Jesus can fix that” solution. We have counselors, therapists, pastors, doctors, and many other professionals that get us through all the bad decisions we make, that create the messes we call our lives. Christians often forget to look to Jesus first. It is important for Christians to counter the messages of our lives with the message of the Gospel. We can not do that if we do not understand the message that is being sent out.   I already said that people are searching. Well, I think that we can be more specific and say that women are searching. Women have built up themselves to be so strong, capable, controlling, and powerful yet do not recognize their own reflection. Liberation worked in America. If you are of the belief that it did not, look around a little more carefully. We are working, we are leaders, we are making money, we are doing whatever we want. We have a choice. It is true that we don’t hold all the top positions in companies. Women have not yet been the President or the Prime Minister. There are countries in our world that still treat women poorly at best. I’m not denying the facts. I’m simply stating the truth for North American women. We should count ourselves blessed.   The truth is women have been fed a lie. If you don’t fight for what you want, demand things to be better, and find strong men unacceptable, then you are seen as backwards. The women’s movement has set loose the emergence of gay culture. A gay man is more acceptable because he wants little to do with a woman besides be her friend. Whoa!! OOOh! What did I just say? Now that is truly unacceptable. I suppose I need to back that up. I'll just move on.  We have all been fed a lie. The message that I got that I am full of potential and stuck in a state of almost, is not true. The solution apparently seems to be, that I can turn that around by pushing my way forward through self reliance. I believe that is a lie. Who is telling me this lie? Wait, lets recap. We are first fed a lie then fed another lie to solve the first lie. Self reliance is very powerful. It is very addictive and works most of the time. So if the message is to be self reliant, to be who you are, to do whatever you want - where did the negative message come from? If we are to be self reliant and look inside ourselves to pull ourselves up out of the muck, where did the first message - the negative one about ourselves - come from? Do you realize that you have a negative message? We all carry with us a message about who we are that plagues us our whole lives. We listen to it every now and then. Sometimes more than we want to or should. So it would seem that the answer is to be self reliant. It would seem that the solution to this wrong message is to build your self up. Improve your mind and body. Find spiritual fulfillment within yourself and push back the negative message.  Why can't we do it? Sure you can look at those in high profile and believe that the road to self reliance works. People that buy into it are wealthy, good looking, happy. So why do I find it lacking? Why do you find it lacking? What is missing in this mind set?

      I just noticed something else that needs some attention!! It was right in my own blog. I wrote that whoever might read this may see that I am a Christian. What did I say about myself that would have led you to believe that? Was it that my dad is a minister? Was it that I talked about church? Those are the very stereotypes that I fought with as a University student. Was I a mere reflection of my environment? Were the decisions I was making only because of my life experience living in a church atmosphere?  I knew a boy that made me question my motivation in my faith while I was away from home. I wondered around for a while, making bad choices, denying my connection with Christ, barley getting by in my grades, giving up on my athletic dreams. I was confused about what I was supposed to be.   I thought that I should clarify myself after reading my own words and seeing the assumption that I made. I made the same assumption that I hated so much. I assumed that because you read that my father is a minister and that I go to church, you would think I am a Christian. Then I go on to say that a Christian is believing in Christ. I contradicted myself.  My parents did not make me a Christian. They taught me what it was. They showed me by example and by explanation. My parents prayed for my salvation. They did not make my choice. I had to make my choice. I had to make it my own. I gave up a lot when I was younger because I did not want to be seen as a follower of my family. I did not want to be seen as someone who did what she was told. What I failed to see was that I did not have to mess up to be different. Jesus has a plan for me that is enhanced, blessed, fulfilled, lived out and constantly moving forward - all with the help of my wonderful Christian background. I am not following with my head down and my mind turned off. I am helping to lead and teach even those that are ahead of me.  Besides, if any of you know anything about PKs (pastors kids) you know that I am far from typical. Most children brought up in the home of spiritual leaders grow up to be complacent about their faith. Many never even make a real commitment to Jesus. Some are even on the opposite side of God and lead the way for others to spit in the face of God. So I guess you might say that I am definately not a stereotypical PK. Now I am describing the stereotype. It is an endless cycle.   So, to that boy who made me think that I was going to be just what my parents wanted me to be, I say - Who have you become and why are you there? Did you rise above that which from whence you came? Or are you still the bastard son of an alcoholic mother with no prospects? We are not what we appear. Only THE ONE can see our true selves.  Let us not say that we do not have choices. Choice is both the beauty and the paradox of the will of God. He can take each one of us and lead us down a path that takes us far away from whence we came or help us fulfill the potential that our background planted.   I am a Christian because I choose to be. It is really that clear. It is certainly not that simple. Simple is only in the decision to choose Christ or not to choose. But making the choice is probably harder than you will ever know - until you have to make it.

      I have noticed something. Well, the thing is I notice a lot of things. The problem is, I do not have an outlet for these things that I notice. I have millions of things to say, ideas to express, and wonderment to reveal. I need to rant. I need to follow someone around and tell them all the things that are going through my head and how important this all is.   I wonder, do any of you feel that way? Is there this nagging feeling that much of what you want to say is unsaid? That much of what you say is said but not heard?   I remember from my childhood, watching my father follow my mother around telling her the important things in his mind. She would continue in her work, yet always replying with,  Oh really  OR  Well, my goodness! You should not say it like that.  OR  More people should hear about that.  and  Yes dear, you are right.  She was a great wife. I am sure my dads sermons would not have been nearly as good without all her input. I know that he still follows her around  the house today. You see, my dad has an outlet, something I do not. He preaches just about every week. I think that makes it easier for my mom to continue to listen with great interest and critique. She knows that eventually he will tell everyone else. This invests her in the process of fine tuning the plethora of ideas that come forth from his mouth. After all, if he is going to say all this in public, she wants to ensure that he is not misunderstood or that he reveals too much.   With this in mind, I set out to write. I need an outlet so that my husband can feel some relief from all that comes forth from my mouth. I should also remember that his warnings and admonishments to not say certain things or to just keep quiet, exist because of his experience with the verbalizing of everything that is my life. Not to say that I reveal secrets and gossip on command. I am an open person. I speak from experience and hold nothing back. Yet, I do not reveal that which is not for the ears of others. Well, lets just say that I am learning not to.  I am 32, turning 33 soon. I am not yet old, but I am certainly not young. However, I am not middle aged either. I can not claim to have experienced it all, yet I know that my experiences are relevant and full. It is a funny place to be I suppose, but I am content in it. I am in some sort of middle place, which is familiar and comfortable to me as I have an older and younger sister. I have been married for nearly eleven years. I have three children, a business and a house. I finally feel old enough to be doing all these things.  I am a youth worker at heart. I only worked for seven years in a community youth drop in, but I still listen to what the culture is telling our young people. I am invested in it because some day my children will be teenagers and I need to be aware of what is influencing them outside of my home and church.   As you can see by now, I am a Christian. Does that spark interest in you? Is your first thought that I am somehow strange? Do you even know what I mean when I say that? I think that most people in Canada probably don't know what I mean when I say I'm a Christian. I am sure that there are those of you that think I'm judgmental and self righteous. I am sure that some of you think that I am naive and narrow minded. I can say with certainty that many of you think I am not using my head to believe in such fairy tales as the bible. Well, whatever you think, I bet I can prove you wrong. I am not what you think and I am not what you would expect.   I believe that a Christian is someone that accepts themselves as a sinful person in nature. Sin, whoa, who uses that word anymore? It exists people, we are not good at the core. We choose to do the wrong thing more often than not. Do you believe that? I also believe that sin separates me from the God that created me (two beliefs in that sentence!). It is through asking Jesus, Gods son, into my heart and life and soul, that I am restored to a right relationship with my Lord.  The key belief about Jesus is that he died and rose from the dead and is alive today. He is preparing a place for all those that choose to follow him and will some day return to take us to our rightful home. Jesus is God. Yeah, I said he is God. You either believe that or he was a crazy person. He said he was God. You can't just think that he is some sort of good guy out there teaching us all these wonderful moral things and generally being really nice. At least if you know what you are talking about you can't.  So I wonder if that freaked anyone out. Sounds like the church lady preaching at you and religious brain washing. Well, maybe to you, but that is your opinion and I wish to change it. Even if only a little bit.  I hope that as I post my rants and rages, you get to know who I am and what I might say about certain things. I am excited!! Here goes nothing!

      A Poem  From long ago....    Locked Away   Morning. Depressing darkness, Making you wish you hadn't heard the alarm. Late nights bring those mornings.  I'm tired of everything. I need to sleep more. My mind does not know what my mouth is saying. Sleep, and I would never awake.  I have my own little world in my bed. The blankets cover my distress. Warmth surrounds me. All sound is blocked by pillows around my ears.  Locking myself away from the world. To dream dreams of the one I love. Away from the fast world, Just me and millions of visions.

      I used to think that I had kids without much thought. I didn't have to wait years to get married. I got married even before I turned 22. I didn't have to wait to get pregnant. I got pregnant even before my marriage and then never had trouble getting pregnant with the next two children.  I never felt that I had waited to have a wonderful baby. I never spent months getting a baby room ready for the new arrival. We didn't have the money or even the separate room. Having a baby had really become no big deal. So I began to wonder. Do I treat my children like they are no big deal? I never really anticipated them years in advance, so was I subconciously treating them carelessly because they had not been cherished before they were born into my world? I guess it isn't really me that is wondering that. I feel that others are looking at me and wondering that. They are thinking that I don't cherish my kids because I had no difficulty 'obtaining' them. Well, a lot of that was blown out of the water three years ago when I almost lost my son. I have never looked at a baby with that kind of amazement and thankfulness. Now all three of my children have almost been reborn in light of that experience. Every mother, and father, needs to go back and remember the wonderment of that new little one. Especially when they are big and lippy and disrespectful and never doing what you would expect.  What I was really feeling one day was this; did I really want to have children or was it thrust upon me? I wasn't questioning my love for them now that they were here, but why did I have them? I was recently going through an old book of poems and thoughts that I wrote long ago. I found something that surprised me. It must have been written in 1987 some time. I must have been upset by something because my hand writing is very messy and looks shaky. Here it is.  Jesus loves The little children. Those of any race, State of mind, Or shape. We choose to abuse them; Distorting their minds By what we do and say.  Lord, I want to have children. I want to give a Christian home To a special baby. Molding a small being with love. Allowing that person to become Someone who loves you. Help me to touch A child's life.  I rest at ease with the gift of children in my home. God planted the desire for them in my heart long ago. I had just forgotten.

      A simple passage from the bible has stuck with me since my baptism. I chose it as my ‘verse’ in my testimony. God has brought it back to me many a time, to remind me to look to Jesus first. The bible says in 2 Corinthians 12: 7-10 (NIV) that God has given us ‘surpassingly great revelations’. When you first read this small passage I’m sure most of you gloss over that small statement. We focus on the thorn in the flesh given by God that Paul talks about. I know, Paul is talking about himself. But as in many other passages, we can insert ourselves into the message. The thorn is only described as being a ‘messenger of Satan’ that torments him. Many of us read this passage and get caught up in what the thorn was, why God allowed Paul to suffer, and why God doesn’t always ‘heal’ our own afflictions. Let us for a minute change the focus. Every person has a weak spot. There is some part of each of us that we struggle under; that we can not master; that we bring before our savior over and over. It could be a physical ailment, a spiritual weakness, a sinful lusting, or anything that causes you to stumble. In this weakness we can forget about the great revelations that our faith has given us. If we focus constantly on the thorn without seeing how it has given us a special place in His ministry, we miss the point of our pain. Paul confronts our assumption that our weakness is holding us back and points us to the wonderful reality we have in Christ; your weakness is made into strength through Jesus.    The great revelations that Paul is referring to are in reference to his vision. It is a vision that as Christians we can claim as our own. 1Corinthians 2:6-10 (NIV) tells us of God’s wisdom that was hidden, that he was holding back for our future glory. God opened the vault when Christ died and rose to life, revealing his ‘secret wisdom’ to us by the Holy Spirit. The great revelations we have in Christ are immeasurable. Not only has His death and resurrection paid our debt, but he has restored us to a relationship with the Father. Our eyes have been opened through the Holy Spirit and where once we could not see the truth, it seems to smack us in the face. We know that God loves us; we know that even in bad times he will sustain us; we know that he is coming back to restore his creation and make right what is wrong; we can face our physical death without fear when our soul is in His hands. We have a hope because we know His plan. Our thorns are there to point us to Jesus and to keep us from becoming arrogant and conceited. It would be awfully easy to just think that we are ‘oh so special’ because we know God.  Are you still asking, why the thorn? The simple answer is, Jesus wants us to need him. He wants us to come to Him for everything. That flies in the face of what the world is telling us. Jesus knows your struggle, your unique weakness that keeps you down or causes you to stumble. Ask yourself why it is there? He knows that I need to be reminded to rely on Him. I need to consider what he has done for me, not what I think I’ve accomplished on my own.   A woman in my bible study pointed out that she had been searching spiritually for years and kept getting told to find strength within herself. It suddenly occurred to her (the amazing Holy Spirit at work!), that she needed Jesus. She couldn’t do it herself and she wasn’t ashamed of it any more. She realized that what was inside her was weakness and unless she handed that to Jesus, it would stay that way. Boy did she get it! 2Corinthians 12:9 says “…My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” (NIV) Think of it. The great revelations of a resurrected Christ, the ones that fill you up in your soul, are made perfect in your thorn, in your flaws, in your lack of. What makes us special is the thorn coupled with the power it unleashes in the hands of our Savior. So, we don’t boast about the surpassingly great revelations we have in Christ. We boast about the messes that Jesus fixed.

      I have told this personal story many times to help others see how important forgiveness can be. For me, the forgiveness of the church is what made the difference in my marriage and my family life.  When I was 21 I had a boyfriend and we had discussed getting married. We were pretty sure it was going to happen. But we were struggling. Pre-marital sex had done its job of confusing our loving feelings. We had sought counsel and tried to ‘never do it again’. I had come to the end of my rope, and felt that my prayers were being blocked by my sin. I told my mother everything. She surprised me with her gentleness and advice. “Get married quickly.” We did not do that. We thought we were too young; we had no money; were still in school; and both still living at home. Our mistake caught up with us in February and that is where the story really begins.  We came to my parents with the news of my pregnancy and what our plan was. That night was a whirlwind of discussion, sadness, joy, planning, prayer, and ranting. I knew I had to make amends. At the time, I was a youth sponsor in my church (Hyde Creek Community Church) and my father was the Senior Pastor (Pastor Ted Klassen, now at Culloden MB). I had really blown it. I later went to my Dad and expressed that I wanted to make it right. I needed to somehow show that I was sorry for what I had done. He went to work immediately. The members of the ‘Steering Committee’, together with my father, decided on a course of action. A meeting with the members of the church was arranged. I was to read a statement and then the church could respond. My fiancé, at the time, came with me as we had been attending the church together. Everyone was pleased that I had agreed to come to them for affirmation of the forgiveness that I had already received from Jesus.   My memory of that evening is hazy. I was filled with fear. I wanted to say all the right things but could hardly speak. I recently found my prepared statement. I did not realize that I had saved it.  “I am deeply sorry for not upholding your trust and for setting a bad example for your children. I stand before you and ask for your forgiveness. The bible promises me this, ‘…that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.’ Romans 8:28 The outpouring of forgiveness in that room still astounds me to this day. I remember being hugged in the arms of many that night. I remember all the prayer for my future husband and myself. I remember the words of encouragement and praise. They actually found reasons to see something wonderful in me. I remember specifically the loving prayer of one woman in particular, Merilee Friesen (her daughter had been in the youth group that I had been leading). She held me tight and prayed for my soul to be uplifted. She said in front of everyone there that I was a great example to her daughter because I admitted my sin, humbled myself, and asked for forgiveness and help.  It was not an easy journey that followed. It was not an easy thing to get passed. But we had a wonderful wedding with my whole church there to celebrate with us. They welcomed my son with open arms. Our church welcomed my husband and he became a member. I was even given back the trust that I thought I had destroyed. I led the nursery ministry and later women’s bible study. I know without a doubt that my experience made all the difference in the world. I will never forget the people of Hyde Creek Community Church.  How did it end up so great? It started with my willingness to take the heat for my sin. The bible says in 1John 1:9 that “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.” I had to admit, it was indeed sin. That is hard to do. It is embarrassing and often easier to just act like nothing is wrong and get on with your life. But remember, confessing brings forgiveness and then purification. My marriage and the beautiful baby that followed were washed in the forgiveness of Jesus and my church. What started with shame and guilt, ended with acceptance and love. The church acted out what Jesus had given me and my husband. We were purified together and given the chance to grow under a new identity. The progression began with confession.  How can your church be that kind of loving, forgiving place? We need to reach out and give those that need it the opportunity to find a place to begin their new identity. The church needs to remember that even as Christians, we still sin and fall short. Making sure that everyone can find a way back is the key. The church should be a loving guide to those who are seeking restoration. If you are living with a sin, or are wondering what to do after sinful behavior is in the open; stand up and take the heat. Let the bible be your guide. You may not need to come before the whole church. You may only need to confess and ask for forgiveness from one, or only a few. But don’t hesitate. Forgiveness is yours to have if only you ask. Then the purification can begin once again.   Our church had many reasons to tell me and my family to leave and take our scandal with us. They had every reason to say that what I had done was not acceptable. It wasn’t acceptable. But they chose the path of forgiveness. They followed the example of Jesus Christ. And I, and my family, am better for it.

      Many conservative women all over North America have been reading the new Dr. Laura Schlessinger book entitled “The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands”. I have read it myself, hoping that I might gain some morsel of wisdom that would give me access to the male mind. I have to admit that I have found many morsels in the book, even if I have heard them before on her radio program. The Christian community, specifically in the US, has embraced Dr. Laura’s practical and straight arrow approach to many different topics. It is somewhat comforting to listen to Dr. Laura’s radio program, even if she lacks the softness and grace that Christians want to offer those around us who don’t know Jesus. We feel that we are not alone in our convictions and family based values when we hear them validated on national radio. However, we should never think that she can speak for the Christian perspective since she is a practicing Orthodox Jew. That aside, her book has touched a nerve among those who have read it and those who refuse to. The most common comment that I hear about Dr. Laura’s latest book  pertains to its apparent instruction to be your husbands servant; particularly to have sex whenever he wants. It is an erroneous comment, but I want to address it anyway.  Dr. Laura’s book is based on the supposition that women have the emotional power in their homes. In essence, women control the environment in their homes and hold the key to change the mood of their husbands. It is easy to see how this is true, even in the bible’s instructions for marriage. Ephesians 5:22-33 is the passage we often turn to when we are seeking God’s guidance in what to do in our marriages. I’m not going to try to explain what it is saying or even incorrectly tone it down for women in the 20th Century. I want to point out two important points. First, men are instructed to love; and secondly, women are instructed to submit. In verse 33 of Ephesians 5 it says “...each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.” Scripture goes as far as to say that men need to love their wives as Christ loved the church (Ephesians 5:25). In 1 Peter 3, husbands are also instructed to treat their wives with respect as the weaker partner in relation to being heirs with them in the gift of life (verse 7). Wives are even instructed to be submissive to husbands “...that do not believe the word...”(vs.1) and to “...not give way to fear” (vs. 6). I have always thought that it was curious that the bible doesn’t tell women to love their husbands and it doesn’t tell men to submit to their wives. I suggest that what we are being told to do is that which we find the most difficult. By committing to being submissive, women can set the tone in their marriage and properly wield the emotional key to keeping their husbands happy - which in turn makes us easier to love.   So why is sex so important when discussing the proper care of husbands? The obvious answer is that men like sex. Look a little deeper and the real answer is that women have been in the habit of withholding sex. Essentially, we take what is the strongest expression of love that our husbands have and use it to control them. Using sex in this way is nothing short of cruel. This is one reason that women are admonished to submit. Women I ask you this, do you think you got the short end of the stick? Do you think that it would have been easier if we had been told, instead, to love our husbands? Read what the bible says about love  in 1Corinthians 13, for example. The total commitment to loving behavior is not an easier task. Men have a huge responsibility before them when they marry, and should not take it lightly. I don’t like to make generalizations but, the majority of men will admit that the number one way they express love is through physical contact or sex. Another bit of scripture that puts the sexual connection in perspective is right at the beginning of creation. After God created a suitable partner for Adam this is what was said about her and all other relationships between men and women to come. “The man said, ‘This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, for she was taken out of man.’ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” Genesis 2:23-24 By creating a power struggle in your sexual relationship with your husband, you are damaging the very connection that your husband has to you. When you read the passage above, it should strike you how intense the connection is that men have to women. They must leave and cleave to you. They must love the way Christ loved the church. All we have to do is be nice.  What is the key to abolishing the sexual power struggle from your marriage? Dr. Laura’s book on the “Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands” takes a practical approach that is worth mentioning. She states that wives should never deny their husbands sex. Wives should offer it up more often, remembering that it benefits them as well. Once married we should not stop behaving like the lovers that we were before we had kids, debt, and no vacations. Good advice. But I suggest another way to bring back the passion in your bedroom. Prayer.   Do you pray regularly with your husband? Did you once upon a time? When you pray with someone, you are opening the door to conversation with God and inviting someone else with you. Even for those women that are married to non-believers, this can still hold true. If your husband is willing to pray with you, then do it! Our connection to our men is the deepest spiritual connection outside of your spiritual journey with Jesus Christ.  Even if both husband and wife are Christians, you may still wonder; how do I pray with my husband regularly? Spiritually my husband and I have walked at different paces. I think that we started out at the same speed. We have often been going along together in perfect unison. But often times our strides increase or decrease in discord with one another. I know that I have times of arid weather in my relationship with Jesus. I am saddened when my husband and I seem to journey with Jesus alone. It is a separation of the very thing that unites us. Even when we are at a different pace spiritually, as often as we can, we pray together. I have realized that no matter where we are on the journey with our Lord, we are both on it. God has it all in his view. Our pace is still together because Jesus is ahead of us both. Prayer has kept both of us in tune with our marriage and kept us passionate for each other. Spiritual unity brings intense sexuality. When our spiritual pace is working well, our sexual pleasure goes beyond the physical act. It works both ways as well. Our sexual connection feeds our spiritual unity. God himself is mingling the two of us for His own pleasure. God's intense desire for a relationship with me and with my husband, expressed through the physical and spiritual act of intimacy, is the mystery of marital sex.  Women should also pray for their husbands. Praying for him will greatly reduce your tendency to nag and predispose you to good feelings towards him; hence emotionally preparing you for a great time in the bedroom. I pray for my husband almost like therapy. As I pray about all that he is dealing with; and all that I am disappointed with; and all that I wish were different; the Holy Spirit fills me with a love that is not of my own doing. Prayer really is your best outlet.  I should mention that Dr. Laura Schlessinger prefaces the book with a disclaimer. All of her advice is null and void if your husbands behavior falls under the categories of alcoholism, abuse, or addictions. I would have to say that I concur, with one exception; the grace of Jesus and the power of prayer should never be underestimated. So, if you haven’t read Dr. Laura’s book, maybe you could just start praying, read the four gospels, and start to do what Jesus would do. I promise that it will change your life and your marriage.

      Spiritually my husband and I have walked at different paces. I think that we started out at the same speed. We have often been going along together with perfect unison in our pace. But often times my stride increases and the gap is obvious only to me; or maybe he sees it, I don't know. Sometimes I slow myself down so that I can connect with him. Actually, I used to do that a lot. I know that I have times of arid weather in my relationship with Jesus. Many of which are not brought on by anything but my own hardness of heart once again taking the reigns. I am saddened when my husband and I seem to journey with Jesus alone. It is a separation of the very thing that unites us. We always pray together, as often as we can, or are awake for. Prayer has kept both of us in tune with our marriage and oddly kept us  passionate for each other. Spiritual unity brings intense sexuality. When our spiritual pace is working well, our sexual pleasure goes beyond the physical act. It works both ways as well. Our sexual connection feeds our spiritual unity. God himself is mingling the two of us for His own pleasure. God's intense desire for relationship with me and with my husband, expressed through the physical and spiritual act of sex between us, is the mystery of marital sex.  I suppose I have much more time to spend with Jesus on my own. I can pray aloud at home with only my children to wonder what is going on with their crazy mother. I can stop what I'm doing for a moment and read a chapter or two of scripture. I can pray as I fold laundry. I go to bible study on my own once a week in the mornings. I have made priorities in my life centered on spiritual growth. What have I learned in my times of solitude? I have learned that I don't know everything. I can not answer all the questions that come to mind and I can not solve all of my own personal issues. I have learned that I need to wait upon the Lord to speak to me. If I don't sit and be still for a time, I will not hear what I need to in the hussle and bussle of my world. I have learned that I need to spend much of that alone time reading the bible. What is the use in being alone with my own thoughts? Often I am tormented by worry, grief, self deprication, or worse yet, I am full of pride. All that solitude with ones self brings, is further focus on ones self. At least prayer is inviting Jesus into the darkness of my own soul to shed light on that which is hindering me in my life. At least reading the bible is helpful because "....all scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness..." (2Timothy 3:16). In light of how distracted we have become from our own spirit, a little solitude with some structure is definately not bad.  But, a spiritual journey is not a trip for loners. That may be a revelation to many of you. Our common belief is that spiritual enlightenment is found in solitude. We believe that we can experience the greatest growth only when we are separate from the poisonous environment that the things of this world create. And really that is not all wrong. Jesus gave us the example of retreating away from others to recuperate his spirit. He was alone in the dessert when he was tempted by the devil and still alone when he was attended to by the angels. That was one very trying spiritual journey that he experienced, alone. Jesus often retreated to pray, alone. When we spend time alone, no one can interfere with what it is that our hearts are saying. Alone time can often be the only way you may actually hear the still, small voice of God speaking directly to your spirit. Maybe we treasure and desire spiritual alone time because it is rare. With all that the average person has to do in a day, who has even a moment to spend in solitude? Maybe we honour those who find time for solitude for the same reasons. Without personal reflection much of what we experience goes by without having learned the necessary lessons they carried.  However, connection is a very important tool in spiritual growth. Not just in marriage, but in anyone in relationship with anyone else. If we journey alone on our spiritual quest, we miss the very important lesson of learning to love others unconditionally. Jesus gave us a new commandment that strongly connects us with others. "Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another." (Jonh 13:34). We can not truly be expressing what spiritual growth is supposed to produce if we remain in solitude. Loving others is hard work. It is certainly not for those who would rather lock themselves up in a monestery and meditate all day. Most people are not all that pleasant. If you are finding it difficult to exist amoung the people, don't expect it to get any better. There are many out there who probably find you somewhat annoying as well. I have heard just about every complaint in the book about how awful people are; and how cruel people can be; and what evil the crowd can commit; and how judgemental the self righteous can become. But Jesus, who loved us enough to die for us, wants us to do the same for those around us. He not only says to love your family and friends; he actually wants you to overflow with love for even your enemies (Matthew 5:43-47).   I suppose in retrospect what I am really creating here is an arguement for attending church. We can learn from others around us as they journey in their spiritual life. We can be of encouragement to those who are having a stuggle that we have already gone through. In connecting with others we are helping to create the healthy family, by genetic connection or through Christs blood, that we all want to be a part of. Sure, there are going to be some nasty people that we have to meet - and unfortuanately you may meet them at church. But in the end, I would rather have journeyed along side those who love Jesus than tried to do it on my own. In the end, when I go it alone, I truly go it alone - even without my saviour Jesus at my side. When I cut off from those around me, I inadvertantly cut off from Him.  I guess at this time I am once again several paces ahead of my husband. I see the ache in him at times to be closer to his Lord. I sometimes want to be his teacher and show him what I have been learning; I want to light the fire in his heart with a little of my own. I struggle to be or to do something because, I don't know what to do. I pray for him and with him; which is what I am supposed to do. The connection between us will not be broken. I no longer slow my pace to try to connect with his spirit. I have realized that no matter where we are on the journey with our Lord, we are both on it. God has it all in his view. Our pace is still together because Jesus is ahead of us both.

      I have to admit that spring break has not been that great for me. My kids are home from school and I have no money to take them anywhere and the weather outside has relegated us all to the house. I have been left to contemplate my financial demise, all the while wondering how I'm going to keep myself from driving the kids crazy with my own personal crap.  It is very hard to go through life and maintain a happy environment for the kids when your own life is slowly going down the perverbial toilet. I love my kids and I don't want them to feel the financial squeeze. But when they are asking for every little thing that they see, it all costs money, which we have little of these days. I have kept them at home with videos, computer games, baking cookies, drawing, and gymnastics class. They seem to be doing OK. They sure fight a lot more when they are stuck at home. I can't wait to go out for dinner on Friday night and leave them to someone else for a few hours. It will also help me to forget about what is happening to my own financial plan.  You may have noticed that I'm fixated on money today. That's just it. I hate money. I have never strived to get more, spent money like water, or hoarded it for no purpose other than fear. I have simply used it so that I can live in this culture we call civilization. I am some what tired of the status quo of North America and would like to "check out". You know, move to some tropical place and exist on the sales of some item while living in some small little hut. The kids could learn to read and walk to some one room school in the jungle. It sounds so surreal, but in the end it wouldn't really solve anything. It would just be a way to hide from what is happening here.  I thought that going to dinner on Friday would distract my mind from the financial disaster that seems to be waiting around the corner, but it didn't. Actually, it intensified it somewhat. We had been enjoying our evening, eating, laughing, and tasting some excellent wines. Then our credit card was denied. All we knew last night was that they wanted to talk with my husband before they would OK the sale. Then even talking to him did not help. My brother-in-law ended up paying for our portion which only made my husband more embarassed. We found out this morning that the problem was not even with our credit at all. Apparently they had flaged our account because we had recently switched to a different card and had also increased activity on the card. They were concerned because of the recent identity theft in BC. It was an honest mistake on the card companies part, but they should have called us instead of embarassing us at a family dinner. My husband couldn't sleep last night, we had no sex, and I ended up with really bad heartburn. I tell you, it is not good to live worried about money. It is physically exhausting.  I have to say that I feel paralyzed a lot of the time. Not sure of what to do, I am second guessing a lot of my decisions. In business you have to spend a lot of money to make any. Lately, we are spending more than we are making. I just hope that at some point it makes a difference to the bottom line. We are in desparate need of a break through. I often think that God likes it this way. Aside from the obvious attacks from His adversary, when we are in a corner God can do miracles. Yet, lately I have found that I am so paralyzed by what is happening that I am not really praying about it anymore. I don't know what to say to Him. It's like I'm sitting here wondering if He cares, yet at the same time expecting a last minute save. It's very confusing.  I find that I am so focused on the very emergent nature of my finances to the point of distraction in my spiritual life. That's it. The devil has done his job. How am I to grow closer to Jesus if all I am thinking about is money? How am I to effectively lead when I am focused on myself? Yet, if I ignore my very real problems and just think that God will fix it all, then won't I simply sink into bankrupcy? What a strange balance I am forced to obtain. I can only pray that I will be less distracted by the "real" world and more in tune with the spiritual events that are unfolding.   The devil's number one weapon against the friend of Jesus is distraction. He uses it on those not yet in relationship with Christ as well, but it is much more affective to keep the christian living without victory. My mom always told me that once you become a Christian you then have another choice; live with victory filled with the Holy Spirit, or be merely satisfied with the saving of your soul from the dispare of hell. It seems obvious which one you should pick. Trouble is, often the choice is not as clear as all that. I lived nearly half of my Christian walk "satisfied". I don't want to be satisfied anymore. But it is a constant struggle to push your spirit past comfort. I think that many Christians believe that they are to be satisfied. But we are not. Content yes, but not satisfied. When you are satisfied you are resigned to the status quo; you are essentially numb to the idea that your spirit needs to grow. If we are satisfied, then we would not strive for more of Jesus in our lives. If we are satisfied we would not see the point in telling anyone else about the joy in our hearts, because there is none. Paul writes in Philippians 3:12-14 that he has not taken hold of "...that for which Christ Jesus took hold of..." him. He had not fulfilled all that God wanted for him yet. He also says the that he presses "...on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus." That doesn't sound like we should be satisfied. There are countless other scriptures that point in that direction. It seems an odd theology to preach dissatisfaction with your present state of relationship with Christ. But you have to admit, there is something knawing away at your inner spirit. Don't confuse it with being something to avoid. Seek it out and you just may discover that Jesus is banging very persistantly on a door that you simply have not opened to him.   I think that I have effectively pulled my spirit out of the dumps. I see now what is happening. What a blessing to have the gift of writing. Maybe someday, I can be paid to do it. See, I'm back!!

      A speech I wrote for my dad's 60th....  60 years of DAD!!  Born in 1944, you were pampered and adored. To your mom you were always number one. You grew and many thought that the worst was yet to come. But you gave your life to Jesus and surprised them all with who you have become.  It has been a long life. One filled with turns and twists, sadness and joy, triumph and loss. But what do we, your children, remember? What is it that we think of when we think of DAD?  The big guy around the house. The only guy around the house. However, it never felt like you were out of place. When we were little it must have been easier to deal with all that female energy in your midst. Whatever you did, all of us were madly in love with you. You lay a foundation that held us captive even through the rough teen years, which nearly killed us all. It must have been the little things that we can not always detail. It must have been the big things, that are so much a part of the back drop that we don’t see them as clearly.   So, what are the scenes that jump out of our minds when we look back at a life time with DAD? I remember from my childhood, watching you follow mom around telling her the important things in your mind. She would continue in her work, yet always replying with, “Oh really!” or “Well, my goodness! You shouldn’t say it like that.”or “More people should hear about that.” and of course, “Yes dear, you’re right.” She is a great wife. I’m sure your sermons would not have been nearly as good without all her input. I know that you still follow her around the house today. You see, dad, you need to practice; you preach just about every week. I think that makes it easier for mom to continue to listen with great interest and critique. She knows that eventually you will tell everyone else. This invests her in the process of fine tuning the plethora of ideas that come forth from your mouth. After all, if you’re going to say all this in public, she wants to ensure that you are not misunderstood or that you reveal too much.   Then there are the special times we remember like our individual lunch dates. I know all three of us remember what we ate, where we went, and how great it was to be in that special place with our father. We also had special Valentines gifts. Even knowing that mom got you started with that one, doesn’t take away the sentiment. You took the reigns with that idea and never looked back. We had a Valentine every year, no matter what. There was the wrestling on the ground and sitting snuggled up to you on the couch - listening to that irregular “thump, thump” in your chest. Popcorn and Disney, or was it popcorn and football, or was it just popcorn and TV? It’s still all about the popcorn. I remember trying to turn the channel from football to something else when you closed you eyes! Of course, there was all those summers of camping. We had no idea that you weren’t much of a camper! Mom made you look great! It was always interesting to watch you struggle through setting up the trailer. No wonder we stayed put for a month - there was no way you were going to do that more than once. The summers hold lots of memories. The special ice cream trips and watching you play arcade basketball stick out in my mind. I also remember that I was denied breakfast until I had completed my morning jog. You were always my coach, yet I took it well, I wanted you to help. Julie might beg to differ, and someone out there will probably never forget what they saw. But, hey, we won’t mention that.   All the reflections of the past remind us, that even if we were afraid to cross you, you were still a whole bunch of fun.  There are countless things that you taught us. Like, brush your teeth and don’t forget your jacket. An umbrella is one of the most important things that you take with you and you should not leave it at the bus stop. All movies have a hidden meaning and may cause you to change the very nature of your value system. And that is besides all the endless sermon illustrations they contain. You can never read too fast. Don’t criticize your wife’s cooking and don’t buy your wife a handy- vac. Read the Gospels. Always take risks. Sex is great, but just get married first. Spend it if you have it, and be sure to give some to God. Everything is worth getting excited about. Every Christian is an evangelist all the time. Buy a car that doesn’t get you noticed. Computers are not necessary. Death is not to be feared. When choosing a tie, always pick the brightest one. Make sure you have the right shoe for the task. Love your family even when they are difficult. Prayer does make a difference. And of course, if you can deal with the worst thing that could happen, you can deal with anything.  So Dad I hope that you are encouraged. Turning 60 may be something that many people do, but we helped you do it with style. In striving for God’s will in your life, you have enjoyed the road and made a difference to us and to countless others. May you never say “I should have” and may your commitment to Jesus always be your signature. Remember this always, we love you. But remember this even more, we all sit here today, because we like you. And that is truly something.

      "Hey, I'm calling because I'm having a contraction that seems to be lasting a long time. Is this normal? I mean, with my third pregnancy should I be having braxton hicks that feel this strong?"  I had called my sister from work. I was having what felt like a contraction and it was February; my baby wasn't due until April 6, 2001. My sister is a public health nurse and she deals with pregnant and new mothers all the time. However, she wasn't sure what was happening. I had been pregnant twice already; this felt like a real contraction. My sister talked with me until it subsided, which took nearly ten minutes, then she said that if it happens again to go see the doctor. That was Tuesday night February 20, 2001.  Sunday February 25th, in the afternoon, we had lunch at my mom and dad's. We were all there; both my sisters, husbands, my two kids and my nephew. We were about to head home and as I went down the stairs, I missed a step and made a very loud thump on the floor. Everyone came running to make sure that I had not fallen. I was OK, I had only jarred myself.   On the way home we took a detour. We were in the habit of driving around looking at homes that we might like to buy. It was like window shopping. We knew that most of the homes were out of our reach, but we just loved to look and to dream. It had become a very frequent weekend activity. The kids would fall asleep in the car and we had some peace in the middle of the day. Besides, we were living in a small two bedroom house that was very quickly going to be too small for our family. So, we were hoping that the window shopping would soon turn into a shopping spree.  "Uh oh. I'm having another one." I braced myself against the car as my husband returned from a peek into a backyard. It didn't last as long as the first one, but it was more painful and I was worried. It was Sunday, February 25th at 5pm. I was going to have to get to the doctor first thing Monday morning.   Later that evening my husband, Graeme, and I went to a church meeting and then decided to head to Earls for a bite to eat. My parents were at our house with the kids and it was our chance to have some 'date' time. We sat down and were looking at the menus. I suddenly felt like I was peeing my pants. Now, that in itself is not an odd feeling for a third time around pregnant woman. So, I didn't say anything. I just grabbed all the napkins on the table and tried to stop myself from making a puddle on the bench. Well, the white napkins instantly turned blood red. I was gushing blood and it wasn't stopping. I looked at Graeme and said, "We have to go, now." He got up and saw the napkins and rushed me to the car. He called our house and when my mom answered the phone, he explained to her the situation. My mom is an ER nurse and she told Graeme to go straight to the hospital. "Don't waste time calling an ambulance, just get there as fast as you can." She knew exactly what was happening but did not tell him because she knew that he just needed to drive. That is all he needed to hear. We were at the hospital in less than ten minutes.  Immediately, mom and dad were on their knees in prayer. My mom knew that I was having a placenta abruption. Usually this occurs and no one knows until the mother notices that the baby is not moving anymore. Then through ultrasound it is discovered that the placenta has torn from the uterine wall leaving the baby without life support, and so the baby does not survive. When the placenta tears and there is bloody show, the mother is in danger of hemorrhage. This is especially so if the placenta has completely torn off the uterine wall. I and the baby were in grave danger. My mother had all this knowledge and brought it to God in prayer. That was all she and my dad could do and what an important task it was.  The drive in the car was a blur. I don't remember watching what Graeme was doing. He ran red lights and was going over 120km/hr most of the time. Thank the Lord that he is an excellent driver to begin with. A bit of a speed freak really. Anyway, I was praying out loud the entire ride. Graeme was listening to my prayers even in the midst of his driving. I was terrified that my baby was dying or already dead. I finally cried out, "Lord, please don't let the baby die! Please Lord!" After my plea I felt a very powerful kick right into my rib cage. Grabbing Graeme's arm I shouted "I felt the baby!! The baby is still alive! Keep going! I can feel the baby!" It was a huge relief and an answer from the Lord that we were not to lose heart.  My mother had phoned ahead to the hospital and had phoned my doctor as well. So our arrival at the ER was very unfettered. The triage nurse saw us come in and asked my name, shoved me in a wheel chair, and I was up in the maternity ward before Graeme had even been asked to register me. My doctor arrived and tried to calm me down. I was very quickly going into shock. My clothes were soaked with blood and the car seat had a pool of blood on it after I had gotten up. Once at the hospital, the bleeding had slowed down, but it had not stopped. Monitors on my belly showed that the baby was under no stress and doing fine. But even that news did not calm me very much. I knew that this was not over. Graeme finally made it up to the room and I'm not sure how long he had not been there.  After an hour and a half, the bleeding was continuing and the specialist was growing concerned. The ultrasound was not showing a clear picture of where the placenta was and where the blood was. The specialist and my doctor determined how far along I was and the risk to the baby and then made a decision. I was to have an emergency C-section before the placenta tore completely off the uterine wall. The specialist explained that if that were to happen they would only have three minutes to get the baby out before the oxygen supply was gone, and the baby could die or suffer brain damage. She didn't want to take the chance. The bleeding wasn't stopping and the blood was building up inside the womb, now was the time.   Graeme was quickly taken out to the room. My doctor turned to leave and I panicked. "NO! Please somebody stay with me!" I didn't know any of these nurses or the specialist. I needed someone I knew. My doctor turned to me and took my hand. "It's OK. I'm going to be with you through the surgery. I need to wash up and so does Graeme. We will both see you in the OR." Good. They were coming back.   I was to have an epidural and needed to lie still so that they could insert the needle in my spine. Well, I was shaking quite badly from being in shock, and it took two nurses and the anesthetist to steady me. I was very nervous about the epidural as I had always said that I would never have one because it freaked me out that they stick a needle right in your spine. Oh Well! From the time the specialist said, lets do the c-section, to the time the baby was out, was not more than half and hour. They went in and got it done. The baby cried right away. He was OK. The doctors said that more than half of my placenta had torn off. They noted that there was some blood clotting that looked old, like it had been there for awhile. Who knows how long it had been tearing off? Maybe my mis-step on the stairs had jarred it to come off further. Who knows why it happened? There appeared to be no indications that the pregnancy was unstable. I had had two normal pregnancies and births prior to this. It was a mystery to the doctors.  Ryan James was born on Sunday night February 25, 2001, had to stay in the hospital for two weeks. He was sleepy and had to learn to suck. His weight was good however; 4lbs 15oz is big for a six week premature baby. It was the hardest thing to leave the hospital without him. I thought I would go crazy. It was difficult to manuver through all of this with two kids at home and a husband who wanted to be at the hospital just as much as me. I praise Jesus that I have my little boy. I thank him for saving me and him. I know that other women have endured much greater than this and lost. I know that some families lose their mothers due to a placenta abruption and most times lose the baby. We were spared the grief of that. The external bleeding is not always there in placenta abruptions. Usually the placenta tears away and there is no bloody show. The baby dies before you know anything has happened. I did not hemorrhage and suffered only the typical aftermath of a c-section. We were given a miracle.   He is three now. Not a day goes by that I don't remember how that changed me. I'm not so willing to busy myself beyond what I can handle. I stay at home with my children, because they could be gone in the blink of an eye. My job, my career, making money, having everything; it just isn't as tempting anymore. So, I thank you Lord for taking me through a dark time. I thank you for letting me go through it in the first place. If you had saved me from the experience, I would not have learned the lesson. Thank you for letting me have my boy. And not just the child I almost lost, but all three of them. They are truly a mystery and a joy.

      I have really been thinking about our individual stories and how they unfold. I have noticed for years that there is a common thread in our troubles. Whether you have lots of money or very little; whether you are accomplished in education or lack formal training; whether you have common sense or none what-so-ever; we have all been fed two lies. The depth of the lies and their intensity vary only because each of us have different psyches and handle our lies differently. For example, I got the lie that I am full of potential and stuck in a state of almost. The solution apparently seems to be, that I can turn that around by pushing my way forward through self empowerment. But, I believe that is a lie too. So, we are first fed a lie then fed another lie to solve the first lie.   Each of us has been fed a soul specific lie about who we are at the core. This lie is a message given to us through experience, upbringing, words of approval or disapproval from those around, and many other factors. It is shaped and molded and sometimes retooled as we go through life. The message could be negative or positive, but whatever it is it can determine how we mold our lives. It can cause us to make decisions in order to gain approval or to avoid critism. Do you realize that you have this message? We all carry with us this message about who we are and it plagues us our whole lives. We listen to it every now and then. Sometimes more than we want to or should. Our psyches are convaluted and complicated. Sometimes the smallest thing can swing us around and change the way we look at our world.  So, the first lie is soul specific. The second lie is universal - or driven by Western civilization. The second lie is, self empowerment will solve your problems. The idea of self reliance is very effective. It is also seductive, because it works most of the time. It works because it plays on our desire to be powerful; it fools us with pride. If we are to be self reliant and look inside ourselves to pull ourselves up out of the muck, how do we do that possible? We have a lie about ourselves that we believe, at least some of the time, planted deep in our psyche. It would seem that the solution to look inside yourself is flawed. Improve your mind and body. Find spiritual fulfillment within yourself and push back the lie. But if you are looking inside yourself, into the deep parts of who you are, and those parts are essentially flawed because of our imperfection, then how are we to be self reliant, look inside ourselves and get through life when we are essentially weak? It doesn't make sense does it? Those of us, including myself, that are strong willed and see ourselves as capable, find this hard to wrap our heads around. We suspect that everyone should be able to do 'it' on their own. We have little understanding for the weaker psyches out there and think that our own strength is impenetrable. Maybe you've never been in a situation that pushed your mental strength to it limits. Maybe you are never going to be. If you are really honest and truthful with yourself, part of your strength is tied into your fear. You avoid situations that would cause your weakness to be exposed. Your life decisions ensure that you are safe from mental destruction. We are self protective and in doing so we lose some of the excitement that we could have in our lives.  Sure you can look at those in high profile and believe that the road to self reliance works. Many people that buy into the second lie are wealthy, good looking, happy. So why do I find it lacking? Why do you find it lacking? What is missing in this mind set? Where did the lies come from? Who is telling us these lies?  Why can't we do it? Well, we can't fulfill the second lies promises because of the first lies truth. We can not be truly self empowered and pull off the complete picture of self reliance because of our essential weakness. When the gurus of self empowerment reflect or preach their message, it is always tempered with a reference to a "higher power", or the support of friends and family. Those that buy into self empowerment cover up the truth that they are really only self medicating with something that appears healthy. You know what I mean. We self medicate all the time. Coffee, alcohol, drugs, exercise, sex, and self reliance. Self medicating with pride and confidence always appears like the healthy way to go. We worship our ownselves and put ourselves above everyone else. We pour every thing into being successful and we did it all by ourselves. Self esteem becomes the mantra of our lives and consumes our decision making. Yet, there is a sense of fear that if we let go, if we don't hold strong and prove our worth by our works, it will all come to an end. It is really all tied into the idea that we are not able to accept that we can not buy our salvation. No matter how good you think you are, you will never be spotless, blameless, or perfect. Building yourself up with no real base besides the goodness inside yourself, is no way to start. Your foundation is weak because at the core it is a lie.  I find it lacking because all you are doing is self medicating. No one deals with the core issue of our lack of goodness from within.There is no other way to explain the horrible things that are in this world. Who do you think did all of it? Who fights wars and kills the innocent? Who murders, steals, rapes, abuses and lies? We do. Why doesn't the good God stop it? Because then he would be controling you. Do you want to be controled? People make choices that lead them down the path of evil all the time. If God were to stop that, where does he draw the line? What actions or decisions should he deem OK and which ones should he stop? More than half the things that you do on a daily basis would have to be stopped if we were to allow God to contol what happens in our lives. It is a stupid arguement to suggest that a good and loving God would not allow any of the horrible things to happen. We have all at some time in our lives made a choice to do something that we shouldn't have. You can blame it on your environment, your upbringing, or your lack of knowledge at the time, but no matter how you look at it - it's still your fault.  What's missing in the mind set that you can solve all your own problems, is that there is no explanation outside of blaming others, for the lies we believe about who we are. But we can't do that all our lives. So where do the lies come from? They come from a place that no one likes to talk about. No one wants to address and very few will admit that they believe it. The lies come from the adversary of God, Satan. He whispers to us so carefully that many of us believe it is our own voice and thoughts that say these things to us. He uses the horrible things in our personal stories and in the world we live in, to fool us into believing that what we think about ourselves is because of them. He fools us into believing that we can master our own lives, so that we never turn to the one solution that is whole and complete.  I'm tired of writing on this subject, so I'm going to leave it at that and talk about it later.

      I have to say, I'm stark raving mad!! I just can't believe some of the things that happen in life and how everyone just sits back and says "Oh, it's OK." NO! It's not OK!  Let me tell you what happened that has set me off. The only full time pastor at my church resigned on Sunday. He didn't just resign from our church, but from the ministry entirely. At first I was shocked, then I got sad, then I started to think about all the things that his leaving meant for me and for the church; then I got mad. I have valid reasons for being mad. I think that my anger is righteous and I'm going to have to let it be known. I have to admit that I am doubly mad because of the timing of this resignation. Just last year, our youth pastor also resigned, left the ministry and is currently traveling all over the eastern world. And this occurred only months after he had accepted a permanent position as our youth pastor. We have yet to find a Senior Pastor and our intern pastor is leaving in July. This current resignation was read by one of our elders and the pastor, who was resigning, was not even in church. So, essentially we are left with a 'green' young man that we hired as our new youth pastor just this past fall, and nothing else. Our church is in the middle of a financial push for our building project (which is to start in July!) and their is no one heading the team. Top that all off with the fact that I just joined the church in February of 2002 - I realize now, under false pretenses. It's pathetic.  Harsh words you say? Well, I can support my disdain for what has now become my reality. I have no intention of leaving the church, but I am embarrassed, frustrated, disappointed, and angry. It starts with the obvious; if you are going to resign, have some guts and do it yourself. It's not expected, in the church, for a leader to come forward and resign in front those that you are resigning from. However, even in the work place, it is considered more professional to at least hand in your own resignation letter. It takes great courage to face the people that you are letting down. It is not required, but it should be required. It also helps the whole church and the one resigning to deal with the gravity of the situation. If you can't resign on your own, then maybe you never had the guts to lead in the first place.  The going gets tough, confusing, less fulfilling, uncomfortable, dry and dull; a pastor should just quit or leave. This equation does not add up to me. Full time ministry is not easy; it is not always clear why you are doing what you are doing; and it is often uncomfortable or rather down right unbearable. How do I know this!? My dad is a pastor and I have first hand knowledge of all it takes to stick you neck out there in the sometimes harsh world of church politics. My father left a job he loved to follow his calling into the ministry. I know that he has struggled to understand the ups and downs of his work in the church. But when he had to make the decision to leave one church body for another, he has always faced that on his own. He has personally tendered his resignation and is stronger because of it.   Off topic for a minute. "Stop comparing leaders to your father.", my husband retorted when I compared this incident to my own experience. I take offence to that. Why is it not valid to compare spiritual leaders to my father? The only reason is because he is my father. We compare Christians to the standard of love that Jesus gave us. We expect our Christian leaders to conform to the standard that the bible has set out in 1 Timothy 3. We compare others to the excellence of those that stand out above the rest. My father stands out above the rest. I should not ignore that just because I'm his daughter. I don't care that he just so happens to be my dad! It goes without saying, that if my father was a bad leader and I pointed that out, I would be commended for seeing past my familial relationship to him. This is no different. I am merely recognizing that he upholds a standard of leadership that I admire; and, quite frankly, I miss terribly.  I am tired of the weak, uninspired, dispassionate leadership that exists in the church today. I look at the atmosphere of leadership in my own denomination and it is appalling. Yes, we have strong leaders that head large congregations; and more importantly, we have strong leaders that are sticking it out in spite of members that wish they wouldn't. The lack of spiritual leaders is three fold; there are not enough qualified men available to lead the many congregations out there; the existing leaders sway to the wind of the board that they work with on all counts; and the loss of leaders to burn out and disillusionment. Why is this so? What has happened that has sent us into this black hole? It's complicated and I probably don't have all my ducks in a row on this one, but I'm going to give it a try.  The first of the three issues in this crisis of leadership is simply a numbers problem. We can only pray that God would see our need for more men and pray that he would call more to full time ministry. In light of this though, we should look at what we can do differently to ensure that those that are called, have the best opportunities to fulfill their calling to the fullest.   The second issue of weak leaders and the third issue of leadership disillusionment, should be attacked by working backwards. How do we foster our spiritual leaders? I ask this because we need to be mindful of who we even foster at all. Not every young person that expresses desire to serve in the church is suited to serve full time. Not every man that decides to give up their current job for full time service in the church or in the mission field, is suited for that kind of life. Our responsibility is to prayerfully consider whether the calling that is being expressed is real. Decisions made in youthful hubris (whether it be spiritual youth or chronological youth) are not always ones that last. If someone comes to you for affirmation of their calling to full time ministry, don't just give it without thinking. Yes, it is a wonderful thing to give your life to full time ministry, but that does not mean everyone is called to do it. If you are thinking about giving your life to full time ministry, make sure that others around you see that God is calling you in that direction. Look for affirmation from strong spiritual leaders in your church that know you well enough to have an opinion. If no one with any integrity in leadership even knows you well enough to affirm your call to leadership, then get to know some. Working in the church does not mean that you have to be paid to do so. Each of us has a field of influence that is our own personal ministry, whether we are paid for that or not. Work with and in the church in any form possible. Flex your leadership muscle in order to see if it is a match for full time commitment. If your calling is real, other leaders around you will see it, affirm it, and help you move forward with it. Are we doing this? A better question may be, are we doing this well? With the number of leadership drop outs, I don't think that we have been doing it well.  One of the reasons that our leaders are weak and disillusionment among them is high, is because of the atmosphere in which we live. Our culture does not foster strong men.  I have tons more to say about this.... But have to go!!  More to come... Why not be a strong man in the church? Leaders of integrity. Women and the church... Why don't I just become a pastor?

						   I just updated my profile and put down some stuff about myself and my interests. I went to view my profile and used the option to see what other bloggers out there shared my interests. I have to say, I knew that putting sex as an interest would group me in a category of wierdos; but why? Why do they get to have it, with all it's glory and endorphins? Why should the joy and beauty of uniting in love be relegated to the sick and twisted realms of kink, bondage, homosexuality and rape? I really hate that we have let them have it. Who are 'we'? We are the majority of people around the world. It is as if we have let the minority take all that is good and enjoyable and makes our lives worth facing every day. Let me remind you, they are the minority. Who are 'they'? They are the masochists, the kinks, the homosexuals, the rapists, and the pedaphiles. I am not saying anything bad about them; I'm merely pointing out that they are the minority. Why do they get to have sex? When did we decide that sex was only for the minority, only for those that make it taboo? I'm frustrated that we struggle to have full sexual lives because all that sex is associated with is the taboo.  When the "sexual revolution" gave birth to sexual freedom, the only thing that was set free was our ability to screw it up. The revolution only knocked down the supposedly bad moral restrictions that surrounded having sex. By doing that we gave it to the dark side and have left it there for nearly three decades. We need to take it back! Sex is ours and has been since the beginning. The dark side has taken it captive. Why do we not set it free? I think that we have forgotten that to set it free is not to abuse it. I know that the "bad" things that happen when sex is abused (rape, pedophilia, etc.) have been happening since the dawn of mankinds' sin. But God gave sex to a man and a woman to bond them in a way that is the closest thing to the connection that we once had with Him when he first created us. The boundaries that we were given regarding sex are hard to follow. I have not always kept them very well. Since when do we not do something because it is hard? Since when do we not hold up a standard that is higher than even the strongest of us, have struggled to keep? I am so glad that I got married and have left the struggle behind me. I am free to find interest, expression, pleasure, joy, fun, and connection in my sexuality. I can not fathom how we have let the essence of sexual intimacy be relegated to those who use it merely for their own glory, power, and selfish pleasure.  How do we get sex back? We need to talk about it. Not just in nice sound bites, but with honesty and sometimes to the embarrassment of a few. We should all read The Song of Songs, from the bible, again. Once you get past some of the metaphors that don't fit our cultural background, does it not embarrass you a bit? Try re-writing it sometime using your own descriptions that are more familiar to you. You see, the reason you are embarrassed by it is because we have been 'taught' that this is the stuff of the depraved. If it is in the bible, what is wrong with it? We have forgotten that it was given to us in love by our Lord so that we may find some pleasure, joy, and connection. It was given that we might bring children into our union. The two people in the Song of Songs are reveling in the pleasure of the physical that is made spiritual through the magic of becoming one.   We need to re-instate the moral code that once upheld it as a sacred act. It is not a tyranny to state that sex is best experienced in marriage between a man and a woman. It is not brain washing to let youth know that in order to avoid disease, emotional fall-out, and unwanted pregnancy, it is best to wait until you are married. You see, everyone still has a choice to accept this as true or deny it has any relevance. I realize that by re-instating the moral code, homosexuals get left out. Well, that is the way it was set up. I didn't say it was easy. I didn't say it was a popular opinion. I just said that it was the original one we given, and I think that it is still valid. No, I don't know any homosexuals. No, I don't have all the answers about why it happens, what to do to help those who struggle with it, or what to say to those that feel that there is nothing wrong with it. I wish I did. I do know that sin is sin. I am a sinner; I'm not claiming to be better than someone who is homosexual. I know that through the grace of Jesus Christ, all things are possible and can be forgiven. Homosexuality is just like any other action that separates us from God and needs to be placed at the cross. But I am admonished. As Paul writes;  "What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside. 'Expel the wicked man from among you.'" 1Corinthians 5:12-13  So, in that vain; we should only be concerned with those that say they are saved yet still practice sexually immoral behaviours.  I have gotten off track.  Everyone has a choice between the good or bad things in our world. I say, lets reclaim sex as one of the good things in life. Just remember, just because there are guidelines, doesn't mean that guidelines make it bad. God's guidelines are there to ensure your happiness. Try looking at it that way. Everyone needs boundaries.  "'Everything is permissible for me' - but not everything is beneficial. 'Everything is permissible for me' - but I will not be mastered by anything." 1Corinthians 6:12

						   I can't believe it myself. I'm a scary, loud, aggressive, bully of a woman. I had not realized that it was that bad. I think that I have mellowed in my age and I don't scare everyone anymore; only a few people are afraid of me! This realization started one evening in a book store.  A friend of mine and myself were out at a local Christian bookstore and she wanted to get a book that I had bought a number of weeks earlier. Once at the store we quickly discovered that the book was no longer on the shelf and she would have to order one in. The clerk at the store came with her to ask me some more specifics about the title and author. After talking with me about it they went back to the till and I heard the clerk say "She's scary." I'm scary!? What? "I heard what you said!" I answered from the stacks where I was standing. They both chuckled and it turned into a bit of a joke. Until we left the store, the clerk continued to joke with me and I laughed about the whole thing. What he said has stuck with me and has brought to mind other comments that others have made to me. Old high school chums, former colleagues, acquaintances from sports competitions and from church; the things that they say about me, first impressions or memories of the way I was, have a theme. I was, and possibly still am, a bit of a mean, scary, bully. Who me!!? I ran this past my younger sister, who knows me best of all, and she said "Well, yeah. You didn't know that?" OK, I think I have a problem.  Another thing that has been going on that brings this whole thing to a head, is the social life of my oldest son. He's not like me and doesn't make friends well. Well, now I'm realizing that he's not like me, he's not scary. I struggle to understand how he deals with his peers. I want to coach him to stand up for himself and not take any shit. What I'm really doing is trying to make him more scary!! But do I really want to do that? He is such a nice boy, why would I want to screw that up? The just of it is, my son wants to 'hang' with these two best friends, and they don't want him to. The thing is, I was once a kid with a best friend. We were not very nice to one girl in particular simply because she didn't fit. We didn't tease her, or even physically touch her, she was just not included. I realize now that we bullied her; by telling her to go away and make new friends. My son is that kid that gets left out and told to go away. It's not any other child's fault, or my son's fault. I just want him to have friends. He's 10 going on 11 and has no one that he can call his "best friend". It makes me sad, a lot. But he is also a boy and boys don't always socialize the same way that girls do. So not only am I different from him because I'm scary, but also because I'm a girl. The biggest problem is really that I see my son as socially weak. I've never said that out loud, or to him. But just knowing that in my head is affecting how I behave and I'm sure it is affecting how I treat him too.  I now know that I need to be careful. All these subtleties can come through in so many ways. I want to make sure that my son has every reason to believe that I think he is terrific. I now know that I want to make sure that I send out the right messages to those around me. I used to think that I was merely an aggressive woman who knows what she wants and goes and gets it. Now I realize that being that way is scary to some people. So, I guess I need to temper that sometimes and be careful to read the atmosphere around me. Not that I should be someone else, but that I should "Live in peace with everyone (each other)." 1Thessalonians 5:13b. I have heard the scriptures admonishment to live in peace, but never realized that maybe I could do more to attain that. I did not apply it to my own natural tendency to be scary. If I am bullying my own children, husband, or friends; I am not living at peace. "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone." Romans 12:18. It is possible. For it is also written, "Jesus looked at them (at me) and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.'" Matthew 19:26.

						   I'm not really writing for my own therapy, even though it does extend my emotional and spiritual growth. I used to write for therapy, but have discovered that it makes for bad, depressing, and insipid writing. Hopefully this next post doesn't fall under that category. You tell me.  What would be different? So many things...   I would have people over all the time. I would have a job; something that was good for being a mom and because he wouldn’t be here to say he didn’t want me to work. I would have a new van; because I would buy what I could afford and not worry about whether it was the best van ever made or whether it was an import or not. I would probably be thinner, because I eat more when he’s around. I would exercise more because I wouldn’t feel guilty for not taking care of other things while I worked out. My writing would be more a part of my life. I would stay up late to paint, do laundry, build projects, clean, study and write; because I would have no one that would get upset when I did. I would go camping as often as possible; because I wouldn’t care that I didn’t have a trailer or all the right stuff. I would definitely have more shoes. The kids and their friends would be here all the time. The house would be decorated differently. I would repair the existing deck and add on the pergolas as I had the money. I’d go to the beach more because I wouldn’t have to worry about making it home for dinner. I would swim more. I would have very few reasons to say “I’m sorry”. The music would always be on with the volume on high. I would have no secrets. I would work with youth, join more church ministry committees, and go to prayer meetings. I would allow the kids to do more of the things that they want to do. My sister’s kids and my sister’s could come over whenever they wanted. I would have a nap almost every day. I would talk loudly and not be shushed.   It seems like everything would be different if my husband were not around. Yet, I can’t forget the things that would be unwelcome changes.  I wouldn’t have regular sex; to be more precise, I wouldn’t be able to have sex at all (not guilt free anyway). Even though I would be surrounded by the people always in my house, I would be lonely; the intimacy would be gone. I would work too much. I would still be living in my rat trap down the hill. Actually, I may not have even bought that house. I guess, if I had never met him, I wouldn’t be a mom; the kids would not be here. Even if the kids were here, they would be less disciplined than they are now – which is pretty scary. I’m not very good at consistent discipline. My sons would be without a male role model. My daughter would struggle in life because of the void left by having no father. I would have to parent alone. With all the shoes I would buy, the activities I would put the kids in, the cd’s for the blaring music, and everything else that I would spend money on; I’d probably be broke (not that that’s different from now, just harder because I’d be alone). I would hardly get any sleep due to all the night time activities of painting and cleaning etc. My adverse tendencies would never have become less a part of me, because I would have had no one to temper them. I would still be the bitch that I was when I was twenty. I would shout at people and no one would tell me that I was talking too loud. Everyone would know my business and I would be upset that they did, even though I told them.  It’s all equal, I guess.   “It’s all about them. When you learn to accept that, you will be much happier.”   A quote from a woman married for longer than me and with more children. She must know something.

						   I am glad that I have the comment post on my site. I have already enjoyed what people have said. I have even enjoyed going to see who the person is by visiting their web site. But one comment is sticking with me and causing me some angst. It's always one thing, is it not? This bothersome feeling is even more silly since I have only a total of five comments on my site. I should just forget the one comment and continue on in my life. But no. I can't do that. I feel compelled to solve the issue and address the anonymous post. Anonymous. That bugs me too. Why not just say who you are? Or at least leave me a clue with a web or email address. I have no recourse but to write. I suppose that is the point. I want to write; so I should thank God for the opportunity to put things down in words, if there is a God.....   That is the&nbsp;issue that is annoying me at present. Is there a God? Is the bible true? I will admit,&nbsp;I hate those questions. To me they are ignorant and&nbsp;personally evasive questions that only make the person who asks them feel smug. Every person that I have ever met who then asks those questions, uses them to diffuse the deep spiritual longing within their psyche. To them it is easier to debate intellectual realities and historical fact, than to discuss the spiritual realm and the fate of their soul.   Anonymous wrote,  "How do you know if what the bible tells us to do is what we should do, it was written so long ago, and it was written by many different people?"  First of all, why anonymous? Now I have no reference point of who you are and why you ask such a question. Second, your question is complex and can not be answered by a mere lay person, such as myself, with the detail and intellect that is required to satisfy the query. Third, I don't know how much of an answer you need; which really relates back to the fact that I don't have a reference point of who you are! See, this whole line of thinking bothers me. The bible is historically supported, through anthropology and theological studies. It is the most&nbsp;reproduced book in the world with some&nbsp;the oldest original texts still in existence.&nbsp; It is not exact history, but it is supported by key events that have occurred in history and are mentioned or recorded in the bible. The bible was not written in one sitting. It was compiled over time using the original Torah (from the Jewish faith)&nbsp;in the Old Testament writings; and letters and personal written accounts by the followers of Jesus Christ in the New Testament.&nbsp; Fourth, if you really want answers to these questions, you should ask the right people and read the right books.  Mere Christianity  by&nbsp;C.S. Lewis, tackles the issues from a logical perspective and is still the most exhaustive resource in Christian apologetics today. Another valuable read that I would recommend is  The Case for Christ , by Lee Strobel. Simply put, it is a journalists personal investigation of the evidence for Jesus (even Strobel quotes C.S. Lewis).   Beyond what I have said&nbsp;thus far; how do I know that what the bible says to do&nbsp;is what&nbsp;I should do? The Holy Spirit. Jesus tells his disciples,  "... the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you." John 14:26  Paul, one of the great writers of the New Testament, writes in a letter the the Corinthian Church,  "'No eye has seen , no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him.' (quoting the prophet Isaiah; 64:4, 65:17) - but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."&nbsp;1Corinthians 2:10-14   So, I guess I'm just not surprised or intimidated by questions such as the one posed to me in the latest comment. I can only pray that those who&nbsp;deny and question the existence of God, the truth of the bible, and the salvation that Jesus gives - would have the scales lifted from their eyes through the Holy Spirit.   Maria Out.   &nbsp;
