      So ya what a fun day of summa skool! i am there for english and math what a fun time well it isent to bad i guess i mean like all my hommies are there gotta give a holla to them for keepine me sain on the first day. Gotta say it would suck if tom sturdy and adrien werent there i think some of my retard skill rubed on them during fall season cuz they failed the same classes i did and they are spost to be SMART! um went to amys yesterday well actualy i was there the whole day gotta say that was interesting we had fun just chilling watching kings of comedy and talking on aim wich is interesting since are computers must be comunicating. What happend was that i signed my name onto her computer while her name was on so i could talk to my friends while she was upstairs or washing dishes or something, long story short when i got on the computer today i had her aim on my computer and all that jazz! soooooo weird took me a long ass time talking to people on her screen name i dident know asking them how to get it off! GRRRRR they are nice tho so no worrys. o scary thing the kid that stalks me is in my summer school class is could result in me killing him (looks around) didnet say that of course.um meet one of rachels friends from river i think shes kinda tight reminds me of mellisa for thoses of u who knew her. um so yeha i might have to clean my room since i cant even tell if i sill have a carpet  lata     Ashlie

      MEh i guess you never get it untell it is feed straight into your face by the person you trusted the most. U think that you can take comfort in them and that they will always be there but eventualy they stab u in the back,Just when u least expect it. Most of you dont know what i am ranting about but i think that the person who this is inteding to go to will figure out it is for them. I mean everything is fine in what not untell you see that person with someone else and what is the best part the person they are with is you friend who you also take comfort in. Well i dont like writing alot so i am going to leave it at this, i cant belive you could make me hurt this much, i never new anyone could but you did congrads GOD I CANT WAIT TELL ERIN COMES INTO TOWN
