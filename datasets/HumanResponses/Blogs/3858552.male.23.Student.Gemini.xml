      Sometimes I feel like I need to shake myself, to wake myself: I feel like I'm just sleep walkin' through out life. It's like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion, But still, somehow, slowly goin' numb inside. I don't like who I'm becomin', I know I've gotta do somethin', Before my life passes right by.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain, An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'. Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin', Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'. Fly like a bird, roll like a stone, Love like I ain't afraid to be alone. Take everything that this world has to give: I wanna live.   Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard to guard my heart. Well, I hardly feel anything at all. I've spent my whole life buildin' up this ivory tower. Now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall. So I can feel the ground beneath me, really taste this air  I'm breathin',And know that I'm alive.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain, An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'. Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin', Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'. Fly like a bird, roll like a stone, Love like I ain't afraid to be alone. Take everything that this world has to give: I wanna live,I wanna live.&nbsp;   Somethin' deep inside keeps sayin life is like a vapor: It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye.  I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain, An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'. Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin', Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone, Love like I ain't afraid to be alone. Take everything that this world has to give. I wanna take every breath I can get: I wanna live.&nbsp;

      Hmmm, its 12:10 A.M., i'm high and we are listening to Rob.&nbsp; I have to be at work in 7 hours, but that's ok.&nbsp; Me and Matt are trying to make plans for fall break, I want to go to a place neither of us have been b/c it's a lot cooler than comparing what you've seen before when you can experience the thing for the first time and talk about it.&nbsp; I really want to go to Boston b/c neither of us have been there and it seems like an awesome place.&nbsp; I always wanted to live in Michigan, but I used to think that i'd like to live somewhere like NYC, but that is way too busy for me and expensive... so something in between the two would be cool.&nbsp; I really think I would like living in Massachussetts.&nbsp; The only place I can see myself living in the future is up north somewhere.&nbsp; I hate jade sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ok, to further the point i'm trying to make if i can, I really wanna have a story to tell when I come back to Mississippi for visits, I now think that it would be an awesome story to talk about boston and harvard and all that good stuff, it seems like living the life of a Kennedy. LOL.&nbsp; I really think Matt and I could live there and actually be able to have a normal life.&nbsp; It snows there, that is a plus and you are near the coast, well right on it.&nbsp; Comfortably Numb is an awesome song, people should listen to it every day.. at least once.&nbsp; I wonder sometimes if i'll ever get outta this state.. I don't belong here!!!&nbsp; I really feel like my life hasn't begun yet, but it's going to soon hopefully.&nbsp; Well, it's 12:21 and matt is wanting rice so i better go try and cook.&nbsp; I hope this blog was very insightful and meaningful.&nbsp; Good-night.&nbsp; Jennifer, please don't comment on any of this!

      Ok, i'm sitting here watching Jennifer think about spending more money she doesn't have on dvd's from columbia house whilst I'm on  urlLink http://www.weedguru.com &nbsp;because it is so much freaking fun.&nbsp; Actually, i'm sitting here counting the hours until it is time to get high!!&nbsp; I love to smoke pot because when you do, all of life's complicated problems can begin to seem so insignificant.&nbsp; It sucks that most places now drug test and considering my major, I ain't gonna be able to do it for too much terribly longer... well... I guess after I initially get the job I can smoke again, but at any rate it is definately one of my most favorite activities.&nbsp; I have been researching the best songs to get stoned to and I agree with some but I have compiled my own top ten list of stoner songs: &nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb (OMG, who doesn't love this) 2.&nbsp; Pink Floyd - Dark Side of The Moon (definately if synched to the wizard of oz) 3.&nbsp; Matchbox Twenty - Hand Me Down (ok, a downer, ,but who doesn't love rob either?) 4.&nbsp; Janis Joplin - Take Another Piece of My Heart (woah, now there's a stoner bitch) 5.&nbsp; Kansas - Dust In the Wind (the violin part is AWESOME) 6.&nbsp; The Who - Behind Blue Eyes (Limp Bizkits version is cool except for his L - I - M - P part) 7.&nbsp; The Kinks&nbsp;- Lola (It took me getting stoned to understand this song) 8.&nbsp; Eric Clapton - Layla (damn, I did inherit my father's genes) 9.&nbsp; 311 - Love Song (another downer, but excellently mellow) 10.Anything Celine Dion only b/c you sound like you can sing the hell outta something with her. &nbsp; Well, there's other songs I like to.. but those are ones that really jump out at me.&nbsp; I can't believe I used to persecute people for being a stoner when there is so much beauty and deepness to the wonders of marijuana.&nbsp; Well, that's all I wanted to say for the time being..&nbsp; I really need to be doing something, but I just don't have the will.&nbsp;

      I hate being poor!&nbsp; It's a Sunday, no work and I'm stuck sitting at the house because i'm broke.&nbsp; I really don't have any political thoughts today so i'll save that for another day.&nbsp; I suppose I need to be heading back to Starkville soon, but i'm awaiting a "delivery" and don't feel like driving back down to get it later.&nbsp; I really don't want to go to work tomorrow, I hate the MicroHELL.&nbsp; It's such a boring job and has no future.&nbsp; I really hate these college kids who's rich ass parents let them run a muck up in Starkville and buy them Hummers.&nbsp; Back on the hotel, it's such a crock of shit up there, you'd swear we work for Saudis in the way that they are cheap as fuck and try there best to cut our hours and ensure that housekeepers get no hours by making us fold laundry all fucking night!&nbsp; I HATE YOU TRACEY AND CHRIS.. YOU ARE SOME SONS OF BITCHES AND CHEAP AT THAT!&nbsp;   >  I think that sometimes too many taxes come out of my paycheck because I sho feel like I work a hell of a lot for just 200.00 a week and then those bitches wanna sit up there and act like I could be in this job forever.. fuck that.&nbsp; Even at a shitty Mississippi teacher salary, before taxes I would bring home 2250.00 a month which is a far fucking cry from 800.00, not to mention no weekend or night work!&nbsp; I really picked the right major for my lazy ass.&nbsp; One sweet day I will be able to tell them to go to hell.. as if i don't already, but then i'll do it while walking out the door for good!&nbsp; I'm ready for school to start back, not necessarily for something to do, but rather to SHORTEN my time even more in this miserable poor college kid life.&nbsp; Oooh, next week we move into the new house, i'm so excited!&nbsp; We are gonna be up in the rich neighborhood until one of us becomes to poor to pay rent then we all gonna be living on the street.&nbsp; Well, I suppose I have ranted enough for the day so i'll end this with a usual FUCK ALL REPUBLICANS statement.

      Ok, so the big vote in the Senate occured and struck down the gay marraige amendment! Score one for the liberals!&nbsp; I'm not saying that i'm all for the issue myself, civil unions yes;&nbsp;however, I have had it up to my limits how these people (namely the family association of america) have pushed so hard along with our good president to deny people equal rights and even amend the constitution to deny citizens of a right!&nbsp; I am not an avid supporter of gay marriage simply because marriage is a christian valued concept and I will have no part in that, but civil unions will give homosexuals the same rights as everyone else.&nbsp; These republipukes that continue to push this issue are destroying the very fabric of our great constitution.&nbsp; They claim that it saves the protected institutions and fundamentals of our civilization, NO. It helps right-wing conservatives continue to cram christian ethics down everyones throat and do everything in it's power to avoid the seperation of church and state in our constitution.&nbsp; Progress will happen, like it or not and homosexuals, interacial couples, athiests and all other minorities have guaranteed rights and I can only pray that these groups will continue to push for what this country guarantees and that is FREEDOM.&nbsp; For all those who reject this issue and say it is destroying our families, let us remember this is coming from the same people who are all for this war in Iraq that is causing deaths in record numbers for WHAT PURPOSE???&nbsp; I suppose that is ok simply because those soldiers are not doing anything wrong by occupying a foreign country that is NOT christian and that in no way goes against the "good book."&nbsp; It is not the soldiers that the democrats are against, IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE WAR.&nbsp; May whatever God you believe in help us if Bush gets re-elected in 2004, b/c the only thing that saved us from an amendment to deny civil rights is Democrat control over the senate... and Hitler won't stop there, he's gonna keep pushing until he crams his Christian propaganda down enough people's throat to change what this very country stands for!

      Ok, so today has been much better than yesterday although it did flash flood in our neighborhood today.  When will the rain ever stop?  It has rained every day since the first day of June which is INSANE.  On a better note, Jade and I solved our problem today after a near 3 week standoff, it feels much better to be a family again.  I don't know if I mentioned it last time or not but Matt finally got him a car and can scoot about freely; I know he's very happy about it.  I'm so ready to move, some people came over here to look at the house tonight and weren't very impressed which I can understand why, when the whole lower part of the house floods when it rains, oh well.. in a few more weeks we'll be living it up in the upper crossing subdivision.  I'm hoping that my finances stablize and we can get on track after all the spending Matt and I have done on furniture and other bullshit for the new house, but hell I suppose we deserve it.  Hmmm.. my thoughts on politics for the day is regarding the statement from "Homeland Security" about a terror warning.. ok.. they have cried wolf so many times until it doesn't really matter what they say, no one listens and I can't blame them.  The reality of the situation is that there is no possible way to monitor every single person in the U.S., so if they wanna strike, they are gonna do it.  At this point maybe if they did it would make Bush lose even more credibility and lose chances of getting his ass back into office, I just don't want innocent people to die just so that will happen.  Well, I'm thought out today, but I will end by saying i'm extremely excited about Brandi being pregnant again, I was around when Jaden was born, but this time i'll get to be around for this one!  Woo-hoo!

      Ok so today has been a bad day as usual.  I'm so sick of living here sometimes.  Jade is all pissed off and hates me, I actually tried being a nice person to her like everyone says I should, but where does it get me.. nowhere.  I am so ready to be out of this horrible state and on to bigger and better things.  About Jade, I have really hated her since she started this Brian guy, she's such a bitch to me and has no intrest in doing things with the rest of us.  Maybe it's from the drug use of her's lately, but ever since Matt went to Grenada and then came back, she's a totally different person.  We all used to have fun when we'd smoke and sit around talking crazy shit together, but now we smoke and she sees how many time she can sneak a bitch remark into the conversation about me.  Like tonight, saying to jennifer "watch out, you may end up like me and then be unable to pay bills and have to move out."  Well i'll say this in response..  Who the hell does she think she is.. does she think that it is ok to bring cocaine into the house when she knows how some people feel about that shit.  At any rate, I am really ready to just get out of this lease and find somewhere else to live and I don't know if she sees that or even cares.  Anyways, I'm not gonna kill my buzz by sitting here harping on this for now.   A happier note for the day, I made peace with my grandmother after we got into it in April.

      Ok, so i've been meaning to do a blog for a while now and I finally sat down and started one.  Let me introduce myself as an extremely liberal individual who is trapped inside the Republican hell of Mississippi.  I'm a college student at Mississippi State University and majoring in Secondary Education.  Now, a disclaimer to how I feel about Mississipians in general as well as the rest of conservative america, I've been doing some reading online with web polls regarding the 2004 election and as I figured, the pattern holds that the MOST uneducated and desolate states are DIEHARD bush supporters (I.E. Montana, Mississippi, Alabama, etc.) Now why do you think that is?  The republicans appeal to the poor and uneducated b/c a load of yokels down in Mississippi will vote for someone simply because they say "down with the queers."  I can just envision a truck load of idiots riding down the road in a pickup with a huge BUSH 2004 sticker on there bumper.. don't forget the truck will have tires too large for the truck itself and an antenna capable of picking up people in kentucky, wait..  I see that everyday around here.  It is a sad world when idiots will vote for someone just to protect their sacred christian values.  Religion isn't paying the bills and if you are waiting on God to help you.. think again.. it's purely coincidence that good things happen just b/c a deity says it's so.  Anyway, I wish there was some way to enlighten the yokels of how none of them gain anything economically from Republican power; as much as Mississippians in general believe that they are rich, they are no where near in the bracket with the weathly that truly stand to benefit from Republican platforms.  Don't get me wrong at the fact that Kerry isn't my prime choice for a president, but anything to get Bush out of power will do.  I also hope that people stop supporting Nader.  That is insane.. granted, I stand more with Nader than I do with Kerry, but c'mon Nader isn't going to win, he's only gonna push the vote in favor of Bush which is a complete 180 from Nader's views.  Why would the Nader supporters want to see that happen?  It just doesn't make sense!!
