         i hate i cant sleep because then i just lay there thinking as the time drags on and on until i feel like my brain is going to explode and then i start to think im hearing shit and by then i just get up and go downstairs and watch infomercials all night, because after i start watching them i cant stop. i get sucked in.      my doggy is so fucking cute i cant believe it. i also can't believe i dont know what breed he is. i think hes a miniature terrier.      i have a feeling school this year is going to be hell. i haven't really thought about how im going to be a freshman this year and that means a lot of work i guess. which sucks because im so lazy when it comes to school. but this year i really need to get my shit together. it doesnt help that i skipped school like every other day last year and barely did anything. i dont know why i was so stupid.     my moms psychic friend is coming over tomorrow. she wants to meet me i guess, because my mom talks about me so much.      shes supposed to be a really good psychic because shes so well-known and everything she's ever told my mom ended up happening. i dont know i guess we'll see. oh yeah because she said i can have a free reading. normally they cost 50$ for a half hour. i'd never pay that much for something so stupid.          i think the last few weeks i've been in like a permanent fog and i am finally starting to touch reality again. i hate it when that happens.     when you spend 2 weeks straight boozing, partying and smoking and then finally get caught by your parents it really makes you feel like shit. and so does everything else. like being grounded and not being allowed to see your friends. i feel like such a loser i didnt get to go anywhere this weekend.      my mom and kimmy are having one of their deep spiritual conversations out in the living room. if they were asleep then id be in there watching infomercials. right now i cant tolerate the presence of other human beings so i figured id stay in my room with my blacklights on and a perfect circle playing while i surfed the net.      my new puppy is named tattenger (after the wine) and is the cutest thing ever ever ever ever. i want to smoke a bowl     last night me and brock were smoking and we got really faded and started blowing all our hits on this bug on the wall that kept crawling around in circles crazily everytime we blew a big smoke hit in its face. i dont know if we got it stoned or not. okay and now im bored with this. but even though im really bored of it im still going to write about what goes on tomorrow when the lady gets here because otherwise i'll forget because i have such a bad memory.     bye

       Somebody I know was raped at this party. She was really, really drunk and a 24-year-old guy took her into a bathroom and made her go down on him. Then he raped her and gave her a bunch of bruises and bite marks on her tits.      I think that is so gross. I don't understand why people have to make sex so difficult. I'm sure the guy could have found a much hornier and more willing girl to have sex with instead of a 14-year-old. They didn't even use a condom.      My parents are like, this huge joke everyone is in on but no one talks about. Whenever we’re in a big group with guests, their snide remarks towards each other are covered up with extra-loud laughs and some awkward silences. It makes me wonder why they’re still together. Maybe its because of us kids. I mean im not stupid I know they got married because she was pregnant. Why else would two people so unlike get married? You don’t have to actually like a person to have sex, and that’s why there are so many unhappy marriages. Our parents were children of the seventies, when condoms were about as nonexistent as a sober teenager at a Grateful Dead concert. I feel bad for girls I know who get pregnant. I can imagine what it feels like, hiding something so big and so scary. I can picture myself doing that. Not, you know, getting pregnant, just hiding something. equally big and scary just not quite so visable on the outside. Even so my mom saw them. The scars on my thighs remind me of measuring tape. Each cut and space between a measure of how long I could go without doing it again, marking time in a sickening way.
