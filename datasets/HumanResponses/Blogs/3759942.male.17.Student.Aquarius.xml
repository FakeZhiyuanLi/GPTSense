      Hello again.  All right i really hope that this is gonna be the last entry, which regards my decision to Leave CM.  I had finally realised that i really cant do anything about my Temper anymore. Its getting worst and worst as the days go on. I mean its really this idea of being a perfectionist over here. My skills are practically going all the way down the River of Nile. Its simply going no way man. My 'NEW' teamates are even better than me. Sincerely speaking, I dont like that one bit at all. Moreover, Im not even recgonised anymore.  Past - WAH lao ehhh whos this guy ah? Ehhh check his id leh. Who is he ah? Ah yoh...No wonder...aHaH what...Ehh...get him into the clan leh..  Present - WTF? Are you sure this is aHaH? Fake one la...Wah? You sure ah? K loh that means Im a pro...WAHAHAHAHAAHA  In the Clan - Used to be very recgonised...Now...No more. Now Opio is the one. I will be frank over here. Im jealous. Fucking Jealous. But trust me. I aint that sort of person who will stoop so low to the extent { fuck your sis? } so as to achieve what I want/deserve. Furthermore, Opio { Siong Chong } is my Best Clan member. I aint gona do those shit to him. In addtion, he deserves this recgonition. He is now better than me.  To add on to the recognition issue, I must say that im not really on ' Husband & Wife ' with my members anymore. Now,NO MORE. Im not included in most conversation lately...never will.  But, even if i suck, it doesnt really make much of a difference...The problem is with my Fucking Temper. I really cant do anything about it. Im angry even as Im writing now. Angry at myself. Angry at my fucked up attitude. Angry at my self for bring such a bitchy pussy. Angry at myself for being so lousy. Now now, Ashley you're such a pussy...Go kiss your mama's Cunt.  Finally, My studies. Its getting incredibly,impressively,unsurprisingly LOUSY. And trust me, Im gonna do it right this time. Im really gona give my chance to do something right for the first time { Guess so. }O yah, Fuck those who doesnt believe this bullshit. I aint gona give a shit to what you think alright. Dipshits.  Even so...I still love CM. I mean this is actually my first clan in some game out there. And, I love all the people in the clan. And i do mean ALL. Funny bunch of Bitches. Great Pals...And its sad to leave all of them to fight without me. Clan Motto ' Till Death Do We Part ' The Big question...am I doing the right thing in quitng, ONLY puting the clan motto into consideration?  And, I really love DoD a lot. I mean Im a war fanatic, and this game is really for me...ITS WW2 based duh...A war which almost destroyed the world, killed quite a couple of millions?   All right. After weighing all the factors on my handy-dandy Weighing scale. I believe that I should quit CM. Isnt it obvious? Im trying to run away from my troubles like a fucking gay. { Im already GAY ^^ }  Yeh Right. I simply feel that running away from this is the best solution. I aint gona argue Why this is the best. But i sure think Ashley is a fucking moronic loser.

      Im the best. Im the man!  First thing first. Im actually his private tutor. Subjects being taught are Science, Maths and English.   The Victim - Me...I respect my job alot. Im a tutor. My job is make my student to be the best.Im not the typical/common 'CON-TUTION-TEACHER ' You see out there on the streets.I dont go to your house just to receive your fucking money for no fucking reason.I aint gonna sit there and watch you fail.I have my own set of codes/principle to follow. With due respect...I uphold these codes/principles strictly. Im especially upset when you do not do well.I give no shit whether your grades reflect on my teaching.I give a damn only when you dont give a fuck for your work.  Respect is the word...And thats what my cousin over here lacks.He has no respect for his work. No respect for his parents.Most Importantly, No respect for me.  What is meant by respect?  Simple, Work is expected to be handled in punctually and the quality of the work must be VISIBLE.This is fucking obvious isnt it?I only expect more than 100% effort in your work.Less than that,Fuck off. Secondly, That jackass doesnt ask any questions at all...EVEN WHEN IN DOUBTS...Jesus fucking christ...Im the tutor. You're the student. You Question, I answer. Its that fucking simple. Thirdly punk thinks that Im his cousin and he doesnt give a shit. Yeh right, smartarse...Im not like your previous tutor {my SiS}. I understand that she doesnt give a shit for teaching you, neither did you as well.Well listen over here insolent fool.Im your new tutor.You change your fucked up thinking and listen to me.im here to teach. Im here to help you. And if you aint giving me a shit, Im gonna give you 10 times the shit back.Whys that so? Duh....Dont compare me with those shitheads out there whos job is to con people. I aint them yah?  So I merely lashed it out all on him. He couldnt take it and began crying.Yeh cool..Like crying is gonna save your sorry arse...HELLO...REALITY CHECK OVER HERE....If crying gonna help...Try doing that for the world... -_-''V World Peace....Yah fuck my arse...

      Day Of defeat. A WW2 Modification Of The Game 'Half Life'Its fun and requires a small amount to play actually.I feel that the game depends more on luck though. Anyway, I have been in this game for quite some time. 3 Years i guess. Played ever since 3.1 or 3? That also means that Im good at that game yah?   Sadly no..-_- And Im telling you right now...The more i play the game...The more pissed I am...Reasons?  1 - Im in a clan at the moment. Clan Casium |[CM]| My nick is aHaH. Im not sure whether im considered a pioneer. but i understand the fact that i USED to be one of the best in the clan. But thats the fucking past yah.Now im more like a fucking noob...And i dont really like that...My new members are fucking better than me...And im telling you.My loyalty seems to be drifting away from the clan...  2 - My own temper itself...Is causing me to hate the game. I never like to my friends to kill me in the game itself { You dare to kill me in real life? I will fuck you Pop And Mum To hell }Even worst.I suck at taking shits from people man...As in all the morkery and stuffs...Just one crap alone.For instance "Ah yoh? Are you sure you're a SR? Even a fucking Noob like me can kill you? SO what are you now? A noob AS well? WHAHAHAHAHHAHAMUAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA. Opps? I had forgotten to spray your body just now....Sorry leh { spraying is thought to be offensive...Its like fucking your mom after killing your Pop }"  3 - Im getting pretty lousy these few days....Aint sure why? Most probably its my whining yah...Yah great.  4 - Fucking DoD communnity in Singapore is still the same 3 years back.Its small...The game is not really recognised man...So what if Im Good at the game? I aint gonna be recognised at all...So play what fuck?   5 - I dont wanna play too much games now...Im promised myself that im not gonna mess my life up anymore.Its a very Fuck-my-face-hard feeling...  Yah guess that these few are the MAIN reasons...Still have quite a couple... A note - Its not that i wanna be famous or whatsoever...Its just that Im a perfectionist.I get easily pissed when i committ a mistake...Fuck it..Furthermore, Im even worst than most of my members now.What the fuck is this bullshit?Hai~~~ the more shit i talk, the higher the temperature gets.....Soyanara...

      Well...I personally feel that the orientation was kinda cool...Cool in what sense though?  Firstly, And im being honest here, This is my first interaction with females over here...Excluding my Family/Relatives/Teachers.Yeh.It was kinda freaky...Expecially when half the class is females... The big question is why is this the first time? Simple. Duh... I had been in All-male School for 10 years...No interaction with females at all.Furthermore, Im a very Lazy/Anti-social/Timid little pussy who doesn't really like to go out and socialise... Lastly, I dont trust females...Its not that Im a Chuvinist Pig {how the fuck do you spell that? ) Its just that i have my own P/C reason. Yeh chill. Only a couple of my friends know the main reason behind that! I aint gonna list who they are.  All right, Lets get back to the O...The new people in My Class BI0408 are pretty cool too.Now Now lets list a couple.  Wee Kiat - Bloody fucking moronic Joker...He can pretty much fuck me to hell man...Thank the lord that Im still alive and able to relate this to you guys...  W.E.N - Thats his nick. Fuck me if Im wrong. I believe that his name is spelled as Soo Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat. Kinda cool,Quiet as most time though. Not to forget, he's from Thailand.  Ardurey - Fuck me again if Im wrong.Looks bloody rich to me though. Rather cool. Hes more like the brain in the group, giving suggestions and such.From Indonesia? I guess...  Verene - Ah just call her marine. AH they are the fucking same pronounciation.Fucking Talkative man. Doesnt really think much when talking with others..."ehh u know ahhhhhh hoorrrr ah yahhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh" My first impression of her was like " What the FUCK? "Honestly, She reminded me of those typical aunties in the wet market...Gossiping/bargaining away...But on the whole, Shes still all right. I kinda feel that shes gonna be a good mother in the future though...COS SHES AN AUNTIE MUAHHAHAHHAHAHHAA.  Rest - Im a fucking failure for not knowing them enough...Yeh fuck you, dont remind me.  Jesus fucking christ... EDMUND SIM WEI SHENG IS MY CLASS MATE...like for the next 3 years? What the fuck is this bullshit? God so what now? NS same plootoon? Same Company? Husband and Wife? Same Date of death? Etc...Fuck that!   First day of O was kinda boring. I cant remember why...  Second day of O was Fucked up. Why. Fucking Good question You pinhead. 10 months ago. I dropped A maths cos' i really fucking hate it so much. AH for fuck sake, That subject is for my future worker yeh...Why? To count how much I deduct their pay...Cool huh...use A maths for such simple calculations....10 months later, And the horror relives...I got to take A maths. Cool huh... Well done Ashley Shen. If thats not cool enough...Guess what happens next.Fuck. Exam the next day. WOOOHOOOOO No way am i gonna pass for that crap. Nothing much really happen after the lecture/tutorial i had on the second day...  Third day. Fine, I copied for A maths. Cool.But whats most important on that day was actually the 'THE FINALE' Concert...Cool/boring at the same time. Why? Simple, Never really liked amatuers playing rock music....Fucking gay and lame... And so thats pretty much.My sincere apologies if this entry is rather lame. Well get this clear Wussy. To many things happened...I cant fucking remember.And yes. Fuck You. THis is my blog yeh?

      There are 1010101010000000111100100101010100101010101111001001 Reasons ( Binary Code ) to why |[CM]| has reached such a state...First we got to look at the time when |[CM]| was still growing and the time when it was at its PRIME...  Once upon a time, In the pathetic Server OF SK or WZ, The aHaHs were enjoying themselves as usual, PwNiNg People away. Then, the aHaHs were being observed/analysed by another group of people..( I cant freaking remember what the heck CM clan tag was then...Note: The Clan name changed quite a couple of times before arriving to the Current one |[CM]| )  As I was saying, We the aHaHs were simply to PRO, not forgetting the fact that we were famous at the same time. Many clans were eyeing for us ( 3 considered alot? )And we really couldnt resist the temptation of joining a prestigious clan... ( SS, WZ )Sadly, none of the clan approached us...But then, This mad arse called Kerplunkz wanted us to be in |[CM]|.   The aHaHs hesistated for quite some time before agreeing to join as the clan |[CM]| was relatively new. But, being the infamous aHaHs, we decided to take a gamble, a gamble which had probably taken quite an amount of our time/effort...  BANG ! CHIANG ! CLASH ! BOOOOOOHOOOOOO! The day |[CM]| was born...3/3/04...Time Passed quickly. Seconds passed like minutes...Hours passed like weeks. We had lotsa of fun over weeks...which aint gonna last long...  Finally...The day had come for |[CM]| to prove herself. Clan |[CM]| had a match with Clan SB ( RedShift now ). Victory was ours and sweet it was! Celebration was held! Enemies Humiliated...For a 2-week clan could win a I-DONT-CARE-HOW-OLD clan.  Then, |[CM]| was HUNGRY for WAR/RECOGNITION. We Decided to challenge a 3-year-old clan. Ambitions were high. Confidence at stake. Result? Day Of Defeat/Destrution...Couldnt be better.Causulty was pretty much higher than WW2 + WW1...  But surely, We will definitely Prevail! We became more ambitious! We recruited more Chao Recruits in. That was the time.....|[CM]| was at its prime...We were simply unbeatable...( Watch Channel 8 and get what that means )  More battles were won along the path to victory...As a result, |[CM]| became even more ambitious...We got The nWos in...which was actually a grave mistake...

      Hai~~~~~~~~~~~ I apologised...But I must really make further enteries on The Subject "|[CM]|"...Its just that If i dont jot all these down...My life's gonna be in peril...I cant sleep with all these 'Troubles' in my mind....  Few days back...I received this grieving news that My dear Mr Kamikazhe had left CM for other 'Particuliar reasons'And i know what those reasons are..Its so freaking obvious...  Wait I will show you guys what My Dear Mr Kami (Im not being sarcastic yah) Typed in another Forum..  "Ok, not much talk cock, I'll make it quick.  After taking a look at the irc topic, I believe that CM requires a reformation, and I think I'll get in the way, therefore me, Kami, have decided to quit CM. I've notifiy leader of CM, Kerplunkz and he've approved it.  --------------------------------------------------  Guys who've been with me since WZ era, thanks for playing with me :D I've always enphasized fun in DOD, never to think of competitive, though I know that CM is going for competitive. But you guys' the best :D Gotta miss you guys :D and Gd luck for the competition!  I couldn't attend training all the time is another thing that I've considered my decision to quit CM. You know, I gotta prepare for NS, gotta understand my tight schedule of gym and exercises...   Another reason could be due to relations with some of the CM members, though I think I should just put everything aside...  1) Thanks kerp for accepting me in in the first place ^_^ You guys are fun to play together with, like I say in the first place ^_^  2) Fett, you're the best :D  3) Ber, you're the best too :D  4) Opio, you gotta understand that my lappy requires a fan and sometimes my mic generates fan sound cause my "big" fan is behind me, but dun you think you shouldn't put it in a sacarstic way? (Majiam you hear fan sound = Kami like that) ^_- That turns me off alot... I mean, ALOT...  5) The 3 scrooge, Asssssshhhlee, EEEEEEEeeeeeed and Doraemon lol... gtg liao, glhf ^_^ hope to chat with you guys again  6) Beef, live the life to the greatest ^_^   7) Finally, to myself.... "Wtf are you doing, recruit!? DROP 20 now!" gd luck to my coming NS life! Can't wait for ORD LOH!  Yours sincerely,   Kaptain KamiKaze  "  Yes...Pretty Touching and depressing yah...I understand. In fact Mr Kami...If your Reading this, I sympathise with you. At the same time, I envy you for getting yourself out of this shit. Well done. Whatever it is, I wish you all the best in what ever you do in the future...  Yes yes...Back to Reality.. The problem now is that More and more Members are leaving...Apparently, Miya ( Best Sniper Ever ) Left |[CM]| yesterday...Why..Bascially the same reasons...Worst to come, Nessa and Dreamix will be leaving soon. I mean they are in the same CS clan anyway, probably plotting the downfall of |[CM]| every now and then ( Kidding.. )  And minutes ago...Luhao my good pal Complained to me, Cursing and swearing...At Boss.Reason? MISCOMMUNICATION! AS SIMPLE AS THAT.  Future, myself aHaH and Doraemon Will be leaving as well..Theres simply no more future/potential in |[CM]| anymore...  Well Done |[CM]|...POOR MANAGEMENT...
