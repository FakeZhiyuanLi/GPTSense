						   You always said that I Should say what's on my mind And when I ever do You shoot me down in flames So I learned not to trust And to run from all people Then you call me out And make me want to run again  Can't you people understand The pain I live with It all turns out the way you plan But not for me So I spread my wings and fly Just like an eagle If only you could see Today I flew  One day I found the way To be just like I need to be A way for me to fit into the world Just like you can And that day I taught myself to fly Into the future But you grounded me with talk And foolish things  Can't you people understand The pain I live with It all turns out the way you plan But not for me So I spread my wings and fly Just like an eagle If only you could see Today I flew  Take my hand and let me Show you the future Let me help you understand... Let me teach you to fly... And you will know forever Today I flew  Can't you people understand The pain I live with It all turns out the way you plan But not for me So I spread my wings and fly Just like an eagle If only you could see Today I flew  © 2002 Coralie Hinds

						   Devils night is here again The fires burning Both in the city And in the hearts and minds of men Tonight blood is spilled The blood of the innocent And of the animals Sacred to the mother Bringing people down To the level of the Denizens of hell The cursed walk the earth Leaving behind in their trail Death and destruction But they themselves are haunted By the power of the gods With each death they cause And each flame they start They hear the raven And begin to fear Cause Devils night does not reward But curses those Who do it's bidding And so I am cursed To forever hear the screams © 2004 Coralie Hinds

      Today is filled with memories for me. Not good ones either. Ones that I don't really want to talk about, but I know it would be good to get them out of my head and written down where I can forget about them.  Six years ago today I was attacked and ... violated ... at knife point. I have to say violated because I can't use the other word. Especially when I believe that it was all my fault. I guess being told that it's all your fault sticks with you, and then going to church and being told by them that the victim of such things is to blame... then it just makes you feel about two inches tall.  And five years ago today my friend suicided. I  hate  July. I just feel so weak. With all this crap happening and this year my memories are so much stronger. The thing that worst about Chris is that I was the one who found him. So forever I'll have that picture of him in my head. Just hainging there...  I have to get onto another topic before I break down. So anyway, this girl who I thought was my friend until she kicked me out of her house has asked me if I'm still speaking to her. I told her that I was and that I didn't hate her but I just needed some space to digest, and to deal with what's been happening. I don't know if she even believed me, but I guess we will see.  Well I'd better go.

      Well I'm not feeling too crash hot at the moment. I'm letting things slide... and I mean that literally. My illness is starting to take over my life again. However, at least this time I'm on my medication. Well most of it anyway. I've been applying for flats and units etc and the wait is the worst bit. Also because I'm single and they are putting people with families higher above me. If I put the real reason why I had to move out on... maybe they'd move me up or maybe they'd ring the police. I mean...  But I'd better explain. About two months ago I became extremely paranoid that my parents were going to kill me. So my brain decided to pre-empt them and tell me that I had to kill them first. So I almost killed my father. It's not something that I'm proud about. And it's definitely not something that I want to put down when I first meet someone, but I guess people do have a right to know if they are meeting a homicidal maniac. Thankfully I only want to kill my dad, and sometimes my mother. Oh and myself...  Seven years ago I experienced the terrible loss of a boyfriend suiciding. It was the worst experience I have ever gone through save when, two years later, my next boyfriend suicided and I found him. And I have friends to this day that don't know about it. It hurts me to bring it up but right now (the anniversary was last week) it's 100% on my mind.  After my grief subsided I began to experience some out of this world experiences. Hearing things that other people couldn't hear, seeing things that other people couldn't see. Talking to things that weren't there. That kind of thing. The worst part was when I hit third year at uni. I was trying to listen to the lecturer one day when she suddenly spoke from behind me instead of the front of the room where she was standing. And so went my slide into schizophrenia.  I think that's all I want to bring up for the moment.

      Well on Thursday I see the head doctor of the hospital out here to get a firm diagnosis for treatment. I spoke to my psychologist today and she told me that the guy is really nice so hopefully he will be able to help me. I also hope that he will arrive at a diagnosis that I agree with. This is all because my dad wrote a letter to the minister for health complaining about the hospital's treatment of me. But they only treat me bad because of two things 1) they don't agree with my doctors diagnosis and 2) the girl who used to be my friend has copied my symptoms and pretended they are hers, and they happen to believe her and not believe me.  I'm serious about that too. She tells me one thing and gets me talking about my symptoms and the next thing I know is that she's telling the hospital that they are hers. And then when I tell them about my problems they tell me that  I  am faking it. I have gotten so frustrated with her. She pretends that she is really upset to get them to put her in when she is actually doing really well but just wants to avoid exams and so forth. She basically treats the hospital as a hotel that she can check into. Then she gets shirty when they take her off her medication. (Some of which I personally believe that she doesn't need.)  The other thing that peeves me about the situation is that they won't put me into the hospital when I really need it unless she isn't in there. And they always put her in the PICU (intensive care unit) although the only reason that she does things like hurt herself is because she wants attention. Unfortunately they taught her right at the beginning that she would get attention if she mucked up so she does. It makes a laughing stock out of the whole system. Why bother to have intake and assessment if they just get fooled by her anyway.  I really shouldn't be bitching about her but I need to get these thoughts out of my head and away from my heart where they have been eating away at me. I really hope that by doing this I would manage to free myself from the stress that these thoughts have been placing on me.  It's not easy when everyone doesn't take you seriously. I have to get to the point where I'm almost destroying myself before my therapists even think there is something wrong. I hate that. And if I go to the hospital they just tell me to go home and take two valium. It seems to be their equivalent of take two aspirin and I'll see you in the morning. Except they don't even want to see you in the morning. So it's not even worth the time.  And so I cry and bleed and hurt and let the sufferring continue. Maybe one day it will become easier. I certainly hope so.
