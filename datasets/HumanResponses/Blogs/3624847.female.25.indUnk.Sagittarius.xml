      Last night, Hannah came over and babysat while Daniel and I went out to dinner. The dinner was a birthday gift from Grandma Prescott. I'm saying this because we do not go out to eat unless it is a gift, or someone takes us out. It is too expensive to feed our whole family, and the kids get crazy in restaurants.  So anyway, Daniel and I showered (a real treat in itself), and went to Red Robin. When we got there, I noticed that 90% of the people there had their kids with them. I had forgotten that Red Robin is a family friendly restaurant. Even though I enjoyed my meal, and the chance to have a full conversation with Daniel, it seemed as though something was missing. First, I felt bad that I was away from the kids. I always feel guilty when I'm away from them. But even more than that, I was surrounded by families. Screaming kids, laughing kids, you name it...it was full of kids. But not mine. I felt almost out of place. The noise did not bother me like it would have 6 years ago. It made me feel at home. In fact, I did not even notice the kid throwing a tantrum right next to us. (Daniel pointed it out.) So I realized that dinner would have been much more fun with our whole family. Yes... even the messes, fighting over who sits where, refusal to eat the 6 dollar kids meal, begging for dessert and twelve bathroom trips it would have included. I really wanted my kids there. (Did I really just say that?)  I love having moments alone with Daniel, after the kids' bedtime, or on Valentine's Day. But for the most part, having the kids around has become the norm in my life, and so much so, that things just aren't as enjoyable when they are not. Now, ask me if I still feel that way after we go camping at Doheney. It will be the first time we sleep in a tent!!       Disaster Du Jour: Yesterday, Trenton took a whole bottle of garlic salt and a whole bottle of fish seasoning and dumped them into a bowl of butter. That was not the messiest event of the day, but the most unusual because he admitted to it without hesitation, but could not give us a reason why. I guess it was one of those "Just for the heck of it" things we sometimes do. Oh well, it could have been worse!

      Father's Day is coming up this Sunday. We don't have the money for a nice present for Daniel. However, I should be getting a credit card in the mail today or tomorrow. As of now, we have no credit card debt (yea!!). But, Daniel really needs some shoes, and that is an understatement. He wears his until they are just ragged. He never spends money on himself. He is a very unselfish person. In fact, he would rather spend the money to make me look fashionable, than have a decent pair of shoes or shorts. Not that I take advantage of it. Buying anything new makes me feel guilty. I wish we had the money to make him look nice. He is so handsome, but has to wear old, rundown clothes.  You know what? I'm gonna splurge a little on him this Father's Day. He so deserves it. He will say, "Why did you buy all this stuff? We don't have the money!" But we never have the money. Five kids drains our bank account every week. There is no clothing fund or entertainment fund. Sometimes, you just need to use a little credit. It will be worth it when he walks into the next family function with his head held high.

      I have a stepbrother from a marriage that lasted a couple of months. Nevertheless, we still think of the guy as our brother. He's the only brother my sisters and I will ever have. We've always kept in contact with him, and we're the only ones who care about him. (We= my Mom, my sister Hannah and I)  Recently, we learned of his drug problem and wayward lifestyle. He's young, 22 years old. It makes me so sad to see him destroy himself like that. So we called him on it. I asked him what was going on. He admitted the problem . I kind of took on the role of loving, but worried mother. I told him that it was time to grow up, clean up, and make a life for himself...in a nutshell. But I did it with love. I gave him my number (again), and told him to call if he ever needed me. I hope he does, but I kind of doubt he will. He was agreeing too easily with what I was saying. I know him too well to buy his story. I feel that he wants to make a change, but is not a strong enough person to do it alone. I guess I did what I could, and that's all I can do. Now I'll just sit back and pray for him...and hope that I don't get a call from the police some night. I hope I did the right thing.

      This morning on the news, they had a story about a young girl who had been found on the street last night. Apparently she acidentally got out when her mother left for work. My first thought was, "How irresponsible of that mother!". But then I remembered all of the times that my own son, 3 years old, tried to escape, and succeeded. We call him Houdini now because of his amazing ability to get out of anything. I put myself in her place. How would I feel if that was Trenton who had escaped? I would be beside myself. Kids will be kids. They have no concept of the danger that consumes us as mothers. I feel for that mother, who had no idea of where her daughter was. Her husband is not here in the US. Only her son to depend on. It is a common problem here in the United States. One parent is just not enough to take on the job of provider and caretaker. I don't know how all those single parents do it. I give them much respect and hope that they find a partner, someday, to share that responsibility. And I hope all of us who are lucky enough to have a partner, are not so quick to judge that poor woman for her misfortune. Remember, when you point the finger, there are  three pointing back at you.

      So I'm taking the first step into the addicting world of blogging. My brother in law says that my kids will become malnourished and my husband will leave me if I start blogging. I think that is slightly extreme. But I have not owned a journal ever since my first pregnanacy, six years ago. Five kids later, I feel the need to have an outlet for all of my thoughts. Of course there is always my husband. He tries so hard to listen to my ranting AND stay awake. But I know he needs his rest. So this is my outlet. I don't know how interesting it will be to those who read it, but that's really not why I'm writing in the first place.  So here goes...this is my life in a nutshell: Married six years, five kids under the age of 5 1/2 years old, stay at home mom, I'm 25. Not much time for a social life. I feel like my body looks like it had been through the wringer. Hell, I'm lucky if I get to shower everyday. I know I'm not the only one. Even moms who have one child feel the same. But honestly, I don't know how I make it through the day sometimes. Let the violins play!!

          Lately, I have been really doing some soul searching. My journey through life so far has taken me through some difficult times. When my Dad had a life change and left, it made me question everything in life I had ever known to be true. I had to do a lot of self examination, and realized that I had to be strong in my faith to make it through. I learned that people will ultimately fail you. It is wrong to put all of your faith in humans. They are not infallible by any means, no matter how educated, wealthy, or powerful they may be. I kept that in the back of my mind, and went on with life. Years later, I met Daniel, we married and I converted to Catholicism. I found in Catholicism, everything that I had been lacking while practicing the protestant faith. I loved it! It  was so rich in tradition, had one main leader, every church had the same mass (to name a few things). But lately, so many things have saddened me. The corruption of trusted leaders, the frustrations of our parishoners, and some very personal issues that I'm dealing with. My heart is so heavy with burden right now. I am not the person I want to be. I am selfish, petty and a lot of other things, at times. The church has failed to uphold the standards set for it. My own loved ones let me down, and I am spiritually luke warm. I am too afraid to step out of my comfort zone. I feel no fire in my heart these days. Everyone, including myself, has failed me. Who do you turn to when everyone you trust is merely human? I'd like to say God. But in all honesty, I think He would like to spit me out of His mouth. I feel like I should not take up his time with my prayers. There is so much else that he needs to tend to right now, who am I to call upon his name? I am just as much of a sinner as those corrupt leaders, lying politicians and every other human on this earth. I feel like giving up.

          I so deeply love and cherish my mother. She is my confidante, my ever truthful mirror and one of my best friends. I recall a time when I was being punished for lying to her about something. I know it involved a boy, but I don't remember the rest. I do remember quite clearly asking her why she could not just be my friend. she replied, "Right now, it is my job to be your mother, not your friend.". I was crushed, unable to understand why she felt that way. Today, being a mother to my own children, I fully understand what she meant. And I love her for that. Here are some&nbsp;of my favorite&nbsp;tidbits on mothers. I hope you enjoy them.  "When God thought of mothers, He must have laughed with satisfaction...so rich, so deep, so divine, so full of soul, power, and beauty, was the conception." - Henry Ward Beecher  "My mother wanted me to be her wings, to fly as she never quite had the courage to do. I love her for that. I love the fact that she wanted to give birth to her own wings." - Erica Long  "One form of heroism-the most common, and yet the least remembered of all-namely, the heroism of the average mother. Ah! When I think of that broad fact, I gather hope again for poor humanity; and this dark world looks bright...because, whatever else it is not full of, it is at least full of mothers" - Charles Kingsley  When was the last time you told your mother how much you love and appreciate her? Even if it was 5 minutes ago, say it again. She can never hear it enough!

          I have noticed recently that the styles for young women are getting a little (how should I put this?) too revealing. I know that fashion is supposed to be edgy and exciting, but this is ridiculous! Mini skirts are back in, but they should be called "butt cheek" skirts, for obvious reasons. They look like our cheer skirts from highschool, except we wore bloomers underneath. I doubt if these girls are wearing anything underneath. I'd like to have a word with the mothers who are letting their daughters leave the house dressed this way.&nbsp; I'm not finished yet. What about the "super-low-rise" jeans? They should come with a tag that reads, "Be sure to wax off all pubic hair before wearing.". Sorry for the crass words but I'm trying to make a point here. Really, how low can you go? (No, I'm not doing the limbo right now) I believe that there is a strong link between the way young girls dress and the rising occurence of rape and molestation. I know that the criminals are still to blame. But the temptation would not be as strong if these girls would cover up a little more.  If the fashion doesn't get more modest in the next 10 years, my daughter is going to hate me. There is no way that I will let her leave the house looking like a prostitute. I love her too much to let that happen. We had limits in&nbsp;our house. We could dress fashionably, but not if it meant revealing certain body parts. Mind you, I tried to get away with it sometimes. But I admire my mother for the limitations, now.  Calling all mothers: time to think about the welfare of your daughters! Stop trying to be the "cool mom", and start being a good mom. Yes, it may sting a little, but your daughters will thank you for it later.

          This morning the kids had a doctor's appointment. When we arrived there was a lady in the waiting room with a newborn. She was tiny, only about 5 pounds or so. The woman was obvoiusly an elated new mommy. She cradled the tiny baby in her arms and talked to her in a calm, soothing voice. It was a lovely sight. We started talking about kids. (I am always&nbsp;asked questions about the kids ages.) Come to find out, this woman was the baby's foster parent. I asked if she knew the parents, she said "No". She was only keeping the baby until the adoptive parents were ready to take her. This tugged at my heartstrings. I could not imagine caring for a newborn and then having to give him/her up after we had bonded. But this woman could not have children of her own, and she knew that she could be of help to others. She also knew that it would be hard for her to say goodbye. But, she said it did not matter as long as the baby would be loved.  Just, then our name was called. We left the waiting room and I said "Good Luck", to her. But the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to go back up to her and just hug her. I wanted to thank her for the brave job she was doing, and tell her what a beautiful person she is. &nbsp;I wanted to say&nbsp;the things that&nbsp;she would never hear from the biological parents of that little baby girl. I only wish that there were more people like her in the world.  Then I come home and read  urlLink www.patrickprescott.com  blog site. (My brother in law's site). One of his recent entries is about the new abortion T-shirt. It depicts an aborted fetus with the slogan "I Was Aborted". Sick...just sick. Thanks to places like planned parenthood, it has become just another medical procedure. No strings attatched...yeah right. What about that baby? What about the thousands of parents who would die for the chance to have a baby? Even one that is not their own blood. The woman in the doctor's office loved that precious baby as if it were her own. And so will her parents-to-be. I pray that she grows up to be something wonderful. I know she will be, because she was given a chance. If I had the money, I would take in and love as many unwanted kids as I was allowed to. But I don't and I can't. So I will raise my children to the best of my ability to be people who love life and value it. And not just value it for themselves, but for others as well...born and unborn. Please take a moment to say a prayer today for all of the babies in this world: born and unborn, wanted and unwanted.

          Marlie (my only daughter), and I are in a wedding tomorrow. The bride is a friend of mine. We go way back (since the 7th grade). Anyway, the requirements for being a bridesmaid sure have changed over the past few years. First of all, I am one of the only girls who has not had breast augmentation. (Thank God for padded bras). &nbsp;Secondly, we all have to have nails put on and our toes painted french manicure (ohh la la). Our hair has to be up and we have to wear matching jewlery. I could go on and on, but&nbsp;I have to get dinner started some time tonight!  Anyway, I have to hire a sitter so I can get all of this primping done. That is ten dollars an hour, paid to my wonderful niece. She's the only one brave enough to take on the task. Fast forward to the nail salon. The nail lady files the tops of my nails with a tool that belongs in my husband's garage. It hurts. Then she puts on some liquid fire. Again...ouch. She proceeds to apply super glue to my nail, and in the process, glues our fingers together! To make matters worse, she rips some skin off my finger in order to separate them. As she's doing this, the acetone in her hand tips over and spills on my leg. Shall I go on?&nbsp; Burning, itching, welts...a plethera of curse words are on the tip of my tongue. I struggle to keep my lips pursed together.  I manage to make it out of there alive. As I'm making my way to the car, I step in gum. Great! I open the car door, bend down to take off the gum laden shoe, and stand back up. I almost make it. My head hits the corner of the door. To sum up this afternoon, I'd rather go through all five labors again than relive that experience. If it is true that with beauty there comes a price, I'd like a refund.

          I remember seeing a hat that my Dad recieved for his 30th birthday ,sitting up on our washing machine. It was black and had an "over-the-hill" slogan on it. I immediately knew that my Dad was an old man. I remember feeling this sense of dread that my Dad would die soon. I even had a few nightmares about it. I laugh when I look back on that day. Now 30 seems like a week away. I wonder if my kids will think the same thing about me. Now my Dad is in his fifties, and that doesn't seem old at all. But I still have nightmares about him dying sometimes. I guess it is not so much the age that is scary, but the idea that our parents will not be around for all of our lives. It makes the idea of mortality a reality.

            Ever feel as though there are two people living in your head? The&nbsp;me that has control of&nbsp;my thoughts and feelings&nbsp;&nbsp;the majority of the time is rational and realistic. But (gulp), there is tiny part of me that sometimes rears its ugly head. It screams, "I'm running off to Hollywood to be discovered by a famous producer and become a STAR!&nbsp; maybe not that dramatic, but you get the picture. To hell with the dishes and laundy, to hell with the bills and responsibility!! I could look my age with a little plastic surgery. I am only 25, damn it!! There is still hope for my dream of becoming a famous actress...I'm ready for my close up....oh who am I kidding???  Then the screaming of the children breaks me out of my daydream and hurls me back into the real world. Leaving a huge bruise on my ego. I look down at my sagging chest. Notice I didn't say breasts. That is because they no longer resemble actual breasts. I don't think any actress has ever breast fed without visiting her plastic surgeon after.  Have I been daydreaming that long? The house is a MESS. The kids are eating a whole bag of cookies.&nbsp;The crazy part of me shrinks back into the dark side of my mind, defated once again by the larger, more sane part. I pick up my scrub brush and start to clean, still practicing my "close up smile"...just in case!

          Yesterday, I went shopping with my mom. We hardly ever get to do leisurely things without the kids. But we had a good excuse. We needed a wedding gift, so off we went to Tyler mall. I have not been in a mall in so long, it was really overwhelming. Anyway, I had a good time  and  learned a little lesson about accepting the inevitable. What am I talking about? Case in point...we print out the registry and mom almost faints when we hold it up. The paper is over six feet long! Then she sees the prices of the items (we were at Macy's...not Target). She ranted for ten minutes about it. And her ranting is never quiet. I roll my eyes and try to distract her with something else. It works, for now. Next up, shoe shopping. Mom finds a pair she likes, then finds out that they don't have her color. Uh oh...here we go again. More ranting, then we move on. The next store has her color, but the price is too high. By now, I start to see some comedy in the situation. The woman has flintstone feet, not many shoes are gonna fit right. So we forget the shoes altogether. We pass Victoria's secret. She waltzes in and announces to the saleswoman (and the rest of the store) that her boobs keep falling out of her bra. "They're too BIG!", she exclaims. I join in, giving up on the idea of a low profile shopping trip. "Yeah, and mine are too small!", I add. Mom laughs, and we procede to&nbsp;remedy our bra situation. We try on bras, laugh at our sad bodies, buy a couple of boulder/pebble holders, then leave the store only a model could love. The rest of the trip was pretty much the same. More clothing mishaps, more loud comments, and even more laughter. Mom sees a pretty necklace and can't read the price. I whisper it to her and she yells ,"Oh Hell No!! I'm not doin' that." I laughed so hard, I almost peed my pants. I realized that you can either do two things when you go somewhere with mom. Get embarassed and be miserable, or learn to laugh at her loud yet sometimes&nbsp;hillarious demeanor. Hannah does a lot of the former, because they live together. But I learned that not being around her all the time has allowed me to tollerate, and even appreciate it. So that's the lesson for today. Learn to love your mother's quirks, because they will someday be yours!!

          Okay, so I'm over the drama of being pregnant again. But I was terribly afraid to tell my family and Daniel's family. I knew that they would be full of negtive comments and unwanted oppinions. But I never expected what was to happen. In fact, the pregnancy announcement was not met with much surprise. So I thought it was smooth sailing. How wrong I was!! It turns out that one of my in laws (who shall remain nameless), was up to no good in the land of bitchville. She decided to tell my mother in law that I plan on having plastic surgery. My mother in law is very opposed to such a thing. (Which I knew.) I asked this person not to disclose any info to anyone regarding the surgery. I would deal with it on my own terms. So she took it upon herself to discuss her "concerns" with my mother in law. She has also been discussing her concerns regarding our finances with other people. Has anyone told this person that high school ended well over 20 years ago (for her)? The backstabbing and gossiping need to stop. The petty, jealousy induced plots to make me look bad, are very outdated. WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF. If someone has a problem  or "concern" that needs discussing, do it with me, not other women. So, I spent all of yesterday, having to explain this "dirty little secret", to different members of the Prescott clan. It wasn't a dirty secret to begin with, but now it is a huge deal. Much larger than being pregnant. Note to family and friends : It is okay to have an oppinon. Just keep it to yourself, unless you're asked for it. And also, don't be so concerned about me. Geez,  I'm not the wanna be barbie that you may think I am. Note to self: remember this incident the next time you start to open your mouth .
