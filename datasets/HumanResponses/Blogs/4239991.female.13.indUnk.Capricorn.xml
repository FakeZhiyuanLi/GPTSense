        WELL I actually am going to add a new thing like almost everyday or at least once a week and act like it is my journal so of couse I'm going to talk about people you don't know but I'll try and explain them to you the best way possible so you know what they are to me and you know where they stand in my life so lets start the thing.    OK well I'm going to explain the people now that I am going to be talkin about there is brittany one of my best friends she plays flute like me and I meet her last year and we are going to be on the same soccer team then there is Jake I meet him 3 years ago he plays drums and he is a really close friend of mine. OK well I think thats it for now ohh and Chris I met him last year he really is just my friend we don't even talk much but anyways Brittany and Jake were going out an all then Jake dumped her all in all his reason was that she was annoying (now that can be true) anyways soo I found out from chris that Jake said she was annoying so Brittany and Jake won't even look at eachother. Well Chris wants to go out with Brittany so this was good news to him and all so he wants me to ask Brittany if she wants to go out with him and I know her answer it's no cuz she don't like him like that but he thinks otherwise. Anyways enough about that I made a B on my math test and I thought I got lower because I'm not good in math but anyways I was happy about that and the teacher told me that if I sung a whole song I would get 5 extra points but of course I said no becaus I wasn't going to sing in the class just for 5 points not worth it but I have my singing competion tomorrow and I'm excited yet scared because I have never sung infront of people before and if I do I try and sound really bad but it's all good we will see how tomorrow works out and I'll deffinatly write about it soon..................

        Sumthings are just to hard to explain. Like love. the only real way we can explain is to explain it on scientific terms which in a way doesn't help. It all depends on how u define it I guess. Some people really don't know me bacause I like to keep sumthings to myself.I like to be private and not let a lot of people in my life. try not to trust a lot of people. It's just how am. I also care about so many other people. I do them a favor no matter how much it might hurt me in the process. I usally give up a lot but ur first apperence of me just might be that i'm not a nice person someone not to mess with but thats my outside apperence trying to save myself but when u really get to know me u kno that i'm a soft person and care bout a lot of people. I try not to get in situations where I can hurt someone but it happens anyway.I usally try to find the answer by not hurting anyone and everyone gettin there way.The only problem with that is that it usally hurts me. Every wonder what keeps a candle burning. It flickers and waves around. It fights and tries to stay burning trys not to die down an eep fightin. All of it's up's and downs even a candle goes through them. Thats why it flickers. We ned to b more like a candle fight for wut we have even though we might b fightin alone. Try to live for wut u have. Try to help the less fortunate than u. when i glaze at the candle i wonder wut it's like being a candle. Wut it's like just flickering an wavin bac an forth then get blown out all the time. I don't know but sometimes I wish i was a candle. The candle makes me relax and understand life to the fulest. It's like i'm going bac on the mistakes i made and how 2 prevent them from happening again. When u c a candle flickering just glaze at it an wonder wut it's like or think bac 2 ur mistakes an c how u can prevent them again. try to relax and focus on the good things in life ttry to find a different perspective. Music is something I enjoy most. I wouldn't live without music. It has soul and helps me relx also. Wut I usally do is sit in front of a candle and listen to music. I relax and daydream. I try to imagine sumthing nice. Sumthin wonderful or wut would help me in life. or sumthing I always wanted to do. I'm very talented in music. I can play quite i few instuments I like to sing and dance to jsut goof around. I like to b independent w/ out a lot of help. I like to kno that i can do things for myself and not always b pampered. I don't mind w/ blacks an whites to gether. In fact I have had a few black boyfriends in the past. Their no different from whites so I basically don't c y any1 would have a problem w/ them comin 2gether. I like the world to b free w/ out violence where every1 can walk 4 miles w/ out havin 2 b worried about bein bothered or shot. The world was happy but now the violence and everything that is on tv has changed people's mind and made them crazy. So many people have went mad and just like being violent. I wish every1 could love every1 w/ out all the hate and violence!!!!!!!!!!!!     WRITTEN APRIL 15TH 2003

      Well I go to school now and it's not the least bit fun. I have 3 brothers but only 1 lives with me now my other brothers live with their dad. I love to have fun and go out with friends I'm a simple person and I get a long with almost everyone. i don't like to judge people before I get to know them and the best saying for that would be Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover. I have tons of friends like Stevie, Michael, Amanda, Brittany, Haelee, Cliffy, Scott, Chris, Damon, Turtle, and much much more. I like to sit back and relax and just have a conversation with someone about whatever pops into my head. I also like to write and read poems and see and exsperience new things. I love to write quotes and poems and you would think I am cable of writing my own songs but I'm not. I don't know why but i guess I don't put enough effort into it trying to find a beat and then the words I feel to go along with it. I'm not that good in school but I do enough to get by. Hmmmm well thats it for now I'll try and write more later....................................................

        I put Kerocene on everything I love and watch it burn.          we both want the world, but we both know that this gets old. if i could open up my chest, then maybe i could find a way to give you just a little piece of my heart. sometimes i would rather cut your lips right off your face than kiss them goodnight. but then, sometimes you can make a room feel perfect when you try...because a mouth full of lies will leave a sour taste that cuts just like a knife as it slides down your throat. you give up the world and fall to your knees to show me that you care. we could believe in windows, but behind the broken glass are fairy tales. not every movie has a happy ending...but frame by frame, i learn to love you, when i see flowers bloom in your footsteps.      it happened all so fast heavy with sleep my eyes closedthe next thing i remember was crawling out from the car andseeing you lying thereholdin your head kissing you for the last timethe taste of blood on my lipsyour clothes torn apart perfumed with gasit seems like it was yesterday when the rain poured downi can still hear your screams as if it was happening all over againsaturday, december 4th that night would become a gravethat would crush my heartjoy and laughter exchanged for grief and silencesearching for so long to fnd you and the momentyou were ripped from melaying here on this empty shelf never to be read againin these pages lies every memory of youthe wind blew your heart over my eyes and i slept for dayspraying not to awake, but these dreams can only last so longfacing the day looking through these tearsi'll always look back and remember that night as you lay therelooking over that casket seeing your face times of past rushingtouching your cold hand wishing it woudl touch me backyou look so pretty lying thee just like the first day we metit feels so real like old times but it's nothing, it's nothingi can taste the stale air on my tongue and death lights up the skyhope finds itself it and end stopping at my thoughtspictures of you help bring back the tearswalking in the present but living in the pasthow much longer will i embrace sorrow?from the moment you entered my lifemy whole outlook on love would changeyou brought out a happiness i didn't even know i hadand now you've gone leaving without a goodbyethat glass heart that rested in my chest has fallen and shatteredhere on lord is the remains of a broken heartfor i have faith you can give me joy and life againdeath has fallen but love covers me heaven is now home to my angel of love          It's OK, nobody's as much of a psycho as I am.            U don't kno u love some 1 till u lost them    Sumtimes i wish that u would just go away but i kno that it's not happenin    Love isn't who u can c ur self w/ but it's who u can't imagine not being w/.    Life is like a game u don't win till u die    It's funny 2 watch boys fall on their faceses.    Hear no evil see no evil speak no evil     If paybacs a sweet and revenge is a bitch then i'm the sweetes bitch u'll ever meet
