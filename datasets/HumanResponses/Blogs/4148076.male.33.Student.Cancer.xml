						   na, sweat in the artificial cold. No I am not like you; I just do this on the weekends. The rest of the time…what? The rest of the time I am healthy? When I was young I thought I was unique, my ideas, and spirit. Now as I get older I fear that I may be just another person with unused potential. I’m messing up more relationships, Vicky is a flirt and I am? Scared I guess.

						   I’m not indecisive, am I? It is like everything is coming into focus. Thing are cleaner. I feel better for having been with them.

						   I did it again today. I took what is mine, and it felt good. I took my time. The teacher told me I write well word-wise but my punctuation is poor.

						   Who knows, I have these wild mood swings. Today was a good day, not great. Nikki poked me with her radio. Chad came back to work and I realized I had missed him. Are you looking for something to do?

						   It is so bad and I can’t fix it. I can’t fix myself, so I have been drinking in an attempt to get to sleep but it is so hot. I am out of ideas. I am out of cigarettes. I got all this time to wait and hate what I am. People care about me but I have no idea why as I don’t care about myself.

						   The essay got done. The switch was the problem and Kenny had to do a lot of extra work and some fast-talking because I fucked up. Wrong diagnosis, damn it. I felt like I wanted to disappear for a while but now I can see it is just a matter of learning from it. Yes, learn from your mistakes. Like telling a paraplegic what a great lesson he learned…my head is wedged between the slats of the headboard and I feel like I wish I were some place else. I blew off 2 people to be alone with it tonight. I didn’t want to break down in front of anyone. This is not comfortable. No but I did all the silly little things. Hi how are you, how was your weekend, hot one isn’t it. No they are not questions. Fine good you how are you doing. It cheapens it, so when you need it becomes meaningless. No that is not where I am ending it. When I am confident I tend to self-prophesize. I can't wait to take phych. Come on something positive? Told the truth and took the heat for my mistake. Caught whats her name checking me out in class. Almost acted like a normal person all day.

						   The phone blinks. The air-conditioner hums. My essay remains unfinished 11 hours before it is due. The weekend was good. Tammie says I will show you my tits if you give me that". Tammie say, "that girl was eyeballing you", "you don’t try very hard", "being friends only gets you so far" and I think I should have tried harder with you. I think that what which I want is not to be obsessive and know every detail. I think that what I want is acutely that person, maybe not her, OK her, but not the one who was checking me out. There is nothing wrong with it, not that I thought there was. Not that I felt anything really except tight on the inside. To live in fear is a terrible thing. Today I did not. Today I took what I deserve, what everyone tells me to take, what is mine. These are the things that happen when I trust a little. Unable to establish a connection , surely the modem is correctly connected to the computer and phone line. Oh good anyway this is where you can spill you know that. Dear blog I could put it differently but I shouldn’t. So secret, not letting anyone in, you know this is no way to be, but in the obsessiveness I find little things that make me happy and I today counted. I did things wrong but at least I tried. Tomorrow I will test the switch again. Just because I like it simple does not mean I should not try. I need to try harder; fuck gurgle goes the air conditioner. Ro frag you can’t start a sentence with but. But nonetheless however are awkward. Breath and go back to Kenny and get it that is what this is all about just get it done and don’t worry and test the switch again. You scare me. You creep people out you know you do but you are loved other places. You know you will do better in a small shop. You know you will do better in a different town and I need to try harder and that is all there is to it. Not at doing it but making it happen. You’re not going to sleep until you finish the fucking essay. It is so bad I need transitional phrases. Except though moreover. I have to figure out what I am doing with the blog. I should post the archives and set it up but I really need to do the essay.

						   mostly half hearted how are doings. She stops and look at me, did Lori just call you? she always does. I feel like I should stick around and explain but I have to pee so bad.

						   Dork you forgot the password. I have got to read the comma stuff. I am so lost, (maybe) and she said she was going to test us on it. Should read but I fixed jessie's car cross your fingers. When I am confident I tend to self prophesize and I do better. It is simple really. Work isn’t so bad. The owner of the dealership say, we got that situation worked out…and look at him blankly and he say the whole peeing in the cup thing. I say yes and he says good, everyone makes mistakes. I try to think of the right thing to say. Thank you and he shakes my hand and I feel better so I go get high. Approval feels good. I do make mistakes but I take them so hard, my own worst critic, it is going to be written on my tombstone. I am editing right throught the blog, Is that a subordinate clause? I am getting rid of the gifs so I can have a faster loading The templet is laid out so nice. the style sheet is differnt but very clear where and you are in it.

						   so here's my new home, someone found me so I moved. Can't have anyone I know in perosn reading this thing because I think that makes me less than honest, my what a diplomatic way of saying I'm a liar...I'll put the the archives some place and I am looking forward to playing w/the templet. I like this one but not the font. Later I have to be off to work
