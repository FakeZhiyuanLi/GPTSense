      ok so i did this test thing and it said my motto is "where has all the rum gone?" lol. thats pretty funny. ok so summer has been awesome so far! VERY busy. today i went to disneyland with rae. it was very fun. the tower of terror is am awesome ride. everyone must go on it. ok so whats up with this mary kate olsen being anorexic?! geez they are freakin sticks to begin with, she is still my idol i'll just have to look over the fact that she doesn't eat. ok so yet again i have another new favorite band, it changes literally like everyday. o well, i love music. ok so my favorite band at the moment is Grateful Dead. i love the song casey jones. eventhough it has drug references i still luv it. ha ha riiight. i don't give a shit. ok so my favorite movie of the day is Donnie Darko. me and rae watched it last night. except the only thing is that i am going to be afraid of bunnies for the rest of my life. ha ha oh and people who are named Frank. it's such a cool movie though, you really have to think and connect everything in the story. and plus Jake Gyllenhaal is in it, omg he is so cute. next week is surf camp. yay i am so excited, me and rae are going to have so much fun! woo hoo. and plus i found out something that is really cool (if it is true ::cross my fingers::) i'm hoping. yesterday we got our wet suits, i am all set to go. oh and pretty soon i am going to start guitar lessons, i am so going to be a rockstar it's not even funny! i am going to call this summer the summer of discovery. i am trying new things and hopefully i will find something i love to do in place of ballet. cuz seriously i have had enough of the fucking studio and the fucking drama and the fucking bitchyness of everyone. it's crazy how insane these people are, they have no lives, and frankly, i want a life! ok so i think i am going to go to bed, and sleep til noon and sit on the couch and watch tv, maybe go to the beach, then see a movie or a bonfire, or go to a party, or go shopping. you wanna know why i can do all of these things? cuz it's SUMMER! woo hoo. let's hang out! peace

      omg, he is the nicest, cutest, sweetest, smartest, funniest, coolest, hottest, friendliest, happiest guy i know. whenever i go out i always think, "what if he is there?" whenever i go anywhere i always imagine what it would be like if i were there with him. everyday i just want to go to bed so i can dream about me and him being together. i day dream about him constantly. i always wonder if he likes another girl (which is probably true). i want to call him but i can't work up the courage. why am i like this? have i gone mental? i am way obsessed huh? it's just been so long since i have had a boyfriend, someone to hug and kiss and cuddle with, someone to laugh and joke around with, someone to talk on the phone forever with. well i must wait. hopefully this summer will bring magic, cuz i need tons of it for this to happen! thats for sure! well i must go. peace

      ok so i'll begin with friday! school was a breeze. we did nothing in english and mr. folker gave me a new nick name, Kentucky. damn that shirt. then in euro we did more projects and dylan gave me another new nickname, KFC. damn my last name. lol. then i came home and slept. then my mom made me go with her to see ballett frankfurt. we went with jade and her mom so it wasnt as bad. it was this really strange modern dancing and people grunted and yelled on stage, it was very weird. ok now saturday. well i was grounded this weekend for no apparent reason, i hate that! so i went to class and then read the whole day. then i had to go to the mall with the family, but it was cool cuz i got a led zeppelin shirt and a doors shirt. so i'm stoked. then i watched snl with lindsey lohan. it was pretty funny. "amadaes amadaes" lol. "i had lice once" lol. 'twas very funny. then on sunday i had pictures for bring on the men at 10 and then i had rehearsal for the academy awards (APA, not the real ones. i wish) which was very pointless and we pretty much didnt even have to be there. then the show started at 4 and that was looooooong. then i went home and did some math homework and then i watched summerland again. that thirteen year old kid that has a crush on nikki is so hot! seriously, he's a babe! lol. well theres only four more days of school left and i only have 3 finals left too! summer is gonna rock i cant wait! yay! peace!

      School sucks. i am so screwed this year! i didn't try at all and my grades are horrible. C's and B's i don't think i am going to get an A's. well maybe in French, but thats it. I'll have hopefully and A in french, a B in English, a B in AP Euro, a C in math, and hopefully a B in Chem (i was so stupid, i forgot my calculator on the day of the final! AAHHH) but i still have the lab final left so that good! ok so off the subject of school: me, quenby, and will had an interesting talk in French today about relationships. it got me thinking, i need to snap into reality and i need to be agressive when it comes to guys, not agrssive in a sense of flirting like crazy and acting all stupid and fake around guys, but i need to get to know people more and so on and so forth. so i hope summer brings some good times *cross my fingers*! so today i had a math test and i totally dominated it! i think i got a 100 percent or i missed one *cross my fingers again*. oh so we got our yearbooks today, i like my picture...better than last year. ok this is another totally random subject: when i grow up i want to be a music critic! that would be so awesome! i love music and i think that being a music critic would be the coolest job in the world! ok on the subject of music, i have a new favorite band, velvet revolver, they are so good! dang i love music, it makes me so happy. also, another totally random note: i have a new years resolution, except its not new years so i am going to call it a summer resolution. ok, i am going to learn how to play the guitar and i am going to study rock and roll history. i love bands like led zepplin and AC DC and stuff like that, so i am going to get to know the history behind these bands so i can use it when i become a music critic! yay! ok i got to hit the books! peace!

       well...i'm new here cuz live journal was being a pain in the ass. but i like this better. it's easier to post and manage my posts and stuff like that. ok enough of the boring shit, i'll tell you about my day. first off, in french i got another letter from my mentally challenged pen pal from France. seriously, he is mentally challenged! he told me lives in a castle with 93 rooms and 54 floors with three indoor pools; then he tells me that he is more handsome than Brad Pitt. thats when it hit me, "this kid has some issues." so anyways, English was fun cuz Mr. Folker rocks! enough said. then math was just ok cuz zack wasn't there to add some new zackisms. AP Euro was pretty fun cuz me and rae always laugh at the most random stuff and it is so funny! then lunch was same ol same ol. and chem was ok. it's dylans birthday today, Happy Birthday Dylan! then i went home and "did my homework" (i still haven't started). so ya onnly eight more days of school left! thats so cool! i am going to be aa fuckin junior, thats crazy! summer is going to rock! i am taking guitar lessons and i am going to surf camp with rae! i am going to miss kelly so much cuz that bitch is going to transfer to edison with all the druggies! jk kelly you're not a bitch i love you like a fat kid loves cake AND ice cream!well summer is near and its going to be good times! Peace!
