      "Project Go" is something I decided to start to get in the game and make a music video. I have been workin with videos for awhile. But they have been done by other artists. So I thought it be cool to make one of my own and direct and with the help of friends come out with a fantastic end product.

      jackie, i'm NOT making out with you. lol...sorry, i don't swing that way. i'm not like justin and jason...HAHA....sorry guys, had to say that. lol. but seriously, if we're really going to do this music video thing, then we better get started. there's a LOT of work put into those things, i mean they take forever to make. so we should at LEAST pick a song and start brainstorming things we could do in it....
