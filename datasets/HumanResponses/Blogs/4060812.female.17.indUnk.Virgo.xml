      here i am again ... 2nd time today ... still at school comp lab doing the project. Cairu says that she will help me tomorrow. Hopes she keeps her words. anyway, i am feeling much better. sorry if i offended anybody just now ... i was damn fraustrated and about to cry(i think i did). Anyway, going to go home and attempt to study cause most of the mock exams are approaching and i dun wanna fail ... haiz!!!  anyway, now, huimin's project seems to have conked up, and she is back at her usual mood again ... dunno it is the how many time already ... i sort of really admire darren for being able to take it. I am already quite tolerant, and i and starting to get irritated at her more often. shumin seems also to be getting pretty short-tempered. I dunno whether it is the influence of huimin, or if she is already like that.haiz!!!

      I FEEL LIKE A DUMBASS!!!!! i dun even know how to do anything, sometimes i think i am better off dead !!! i dun know wad the hell is wrong with me. Sometimes, i think that i really am being taken granted of !!!! they dun seem to care about me!!!! i sometimes think whether do i deserve such treatment or not. Take the VB for  example , huimin and shumin only seem to care that as long as their project is done, then that's all. What about me? They have completed the project, but i haven!!!! They wanna leave already ... but i haven even gotten anywhere in the project, and i am getting sick of this project already!!!!! arghh!!!!  i seriously think i am gonna flunk this freaking course and disappoint everyone in this entire world!!!! My mum and dad are so gonna make me feel guilty for not doing well again ... and maybe i should just stop school and start working !!!! argh!!!

      Just saw Bel's blog. She seems to be very happy now ... made 6 new friends and even have a group name. While here i am, feeling so miserable on how come life is so sucky for me? I feel that most of my poly friends take me for granted, when they actually dun like me ... and i dunno , but i just feel like shit now ... I am very happy for Bel, but i dun know if this will cause us to drift apart, by the fact that we are both now in different polys and my class time tables are now diferent. We dun get to talk much, wad more hang out with one another. HAaiz!!!! Really missed 4F!!!!! Sometimes, i dun know wad to look forward to going to school for, sometimes, when i dun even understand wad the lecturer is talking about or how to work those equipments!!!! Argh!!!!

      Hey!!! Today is Saturday and i met up with my TK friends!!! Woah!!! So Happy!!!! I missed them sooo much!!! Haha!!!! Anyway, went to school early today, at about 9, maybe. Tried to do that freking visual programming thing, but didnt get far on it!!! So frustrating!!!   Anyway, left school at about 12, rushed over to Orcard to look for the guys!!! Met them at Breeks!!! Bhavna, Bel, Kesh and Nurfarhana. Di and del was not there yet !!! Missed them man!!! Haven seen these guys for like at least 2 – 3 months ... HAHA!!! Anyway, didnt have a great lunch, was okay la ... everyone was sooo slim and pretty, made me feel like shit sia ... must go on diet sia ... hmmp!!! Proceeded to Paragon to watch MJC perform ... i0t was actually pretty lousy cause the music was sooo damn soft and the moves werent that great either, but wadever!!! Anyway, met some of 4F ppl. So glad to see them, felt like hugging them too but didnt dare ... haiz!!! Met sham, ks, and i think thats about all.   Oh ya, i dun know why, but i always feel like a freaking lamp-post whenever arund Darren and Huimin. They always seem to want me to be around, but i feel out of the place. Haiz, i think i am fated to be a match-maker for life sia ... first Feli and Yongsheng, now Darren and Huimin. Well, hope that things will turn out great for these 2 couples, especially between Darren and Huimin, or not have to step in and help. Its not that i mind, but i hope that it would be solved between themselves.   Another thing, i dunno why, but it seems that the group is like going to offically break lor. I dun seem to be talking to Daisy and Feli anymore. We dun seem to have anything to talk about, althoug we used to have lots to talk about!!! Well, maybe this will turn out to be the best for everyone!!! Anyway, Tg will be going to TW for some com comp., will miss him, but only as a friend. Istill dun understand how he can be mistaken that i like him. Haiz!!! Just let it pass la ... That’s how life is, i guess.   Tests are coming soon, and i think i better start studying hard or i am sooo gonna fail man!!! I dunno whether it is because the course is not my knid or is it that i just dun understand wad the hell the lecturers are teaching. Especially computer hardware. Digital circuit, Data com. And visual are gettign harder too !!! How the hell am i gonna to be able to be the top 5 if this continues!!!! I feel like i am gonna be in deep shit sia ... Better start studyuing man!!!!   Kk, think i am gonna end pretty soon !!! it’s getting alittle too long!!!!  Tata>>>  P.S: I dun think i like Olaf at all . i treat him as like a good friend only ... so here i am ... offically(or should it be unoffically) SINGLE again!!! Hahaha ...

      Yap ... The 1st day, we all met at the tanah merah ferry terminal ... ohhh ... how glad i was to see him ... lahtough i like saw him only like less than 8 hours ago ... haha ... i feel like a small girl !!!! Anyway, when we boarded the ferry, we all sat down; me, my sis, him, his sis. And we all actually fell asleep !!! cause we were all too tired ... LOL!!! Anyway, when we got there, we got a very very warm welcome from the people there. Haha ... There were also pretty much sights to see !!! muahahahah!!!! But i will stay loyal to you-know-who!!! Anyway, That day, we did pretty much almost every landspot there was to do ... I WAS SO DAMN TIRED TO DO ANYTHING BY THE TIME IT WAS NIGHTFALL!!! We did squash, tennis, badminton, basketball, volleyball, and many many more which i have practically forgotten. Anyway, we also went swimming for like about a few hours and the sun was scorching like hell!!!! Me and Olaf like had a few waterfights, trying to drown one another out!!! Hahahaha !!! We had such great fun that day, but also lots of muscle-aches. Oh ya, that night after dinner, there was a show(as usual) and it wasnt as interesting as i had remembered it to be, but anyway, we stayed on till the end of the show. After the show, we proceeded to the disco . When we got there, as i was sitting down and he went to get drinks, 2 girls approached him and started to talk to him. Surprisingly, i did not feel anything at all ... He felt pretty embarassed and guilty, i dun know for wad reason. But i decided to excuse myself. I left to go outside and he followed along. I told him that he could go and accompany his new girlfriends and he said that he would rather accompany me ... Wadever. We went for a walk at the beach. The beach was sooo peaceful ... I felt so at ease. We talked as we walked from one end to the other, and back again. It got too late and we decicded to go back to out rooms and sleep. Day 2 was for water sports . We did practically almost every water sport and was so exhausted by noon that we just fell asleep after lunch. We woke up beside one another at about 4pm and went on to play some more sports and swimming. Another waterfight went on, till i surrendered and let him drown me just once. Hahaha !!!! Day 3 was the day we were leaving club med and i actually miss this place. We spent the morning packing our lagguage and left for the ferry terminal. Having reached Singapore, we proceeded for dinner at Changi. When we sent them to Changi Airport for their flight to Colombo, i gave him a hug. Thats about all!!!! I MISS HIM SOOO MUCH ALREADY AND ANTICIPATING FOR HIS RETURN VISIT TO SINGAPORE AGAIN!!!!
