      Well, I had a nice weekend. Friday evening was a Pep band gig at a local high school, and then I had dinner with two friends, Laura and Lainey. Saturday was a football game here at #2 in the nation in football VSU. It turned out to be a really close game, won in the last quarter, and we definitely had God on our side. They had the ball on their two yard line with 10 seconds... how we defended, I'm not so sure, but we did. Anyway, it provided for about 5 minutes of playing the HEY song followed by a few repetitions of the fight song and the "Defense cheer" that we now play from the movie Drumline. Those of you in the band world know what I'm talking about.  After roasting in the sun at the football game, it was time to come home, recover, and get all cute for the opera. I had too, because two days of being in a band uniform is enough to make anyone want to feel pretty once again. So, I got all "girled' up in a little black dress and strappy heels. Not to brag, but I'll give myself props on this one. I was really surprised with how it all came together, as were my friends there. Okay ya'll, I do own cute clothes, and I do know how to put it together, I just usually don't because there really isn't a reason to look "cute" for class. Why anyone would want to wear top fashion to a 9am computer class is beyond me. Jeans and some sort of tshirt usually works just fine for me. Anyway, the Marriage of Figaro rocked, and I thought it was one of the best VSU operas I've ever seen (out of five). Afterwards, I went to dinner with Keith and Russ, and we talked about the "old" times of VSU. Not too old though, I'm referring to the late nineties. We had a great time, and I finally felt like I was "living" life for a moment.  Sunday I spent mostly sleeping, which is absolutely required once in a while. I'll leave that statement where it stands.   Monday, today, was not so fun. Yeah. Okay, here's the deal. Due to one advising error and 3 over-lapping classes, I can not graduate until December 2004. I was very ill with the situation at the time, and poor Mom and Dad got an earful from me about it. I know its not their fault, but I had to vent at someone. I guess I am kinda fortunate. Its another half-year of college. Its just the principle of the thing that got to me.  Well, I can not leave with out another thought.  "Education has for its object the formation of character." ~Herbert Spencer (1820-1903)  Okay, so I have absolutely no idea who Spencer is, but I like the quote. Without the challenges, defeats, and complications one experiences at college, character would not be built. Not only does the education taught in the classroom teach us something, but so does the education we get from dealing with people, and with dealing with ourselves while at college. Maybe God wants me to have one really strong character for something in the future... that would explain yet another semester here.....  I did get to talk with two of my best friends tonight. I don't know what I would do without Irene and Scott. Of friends:  "A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of Nature." ~Emerson  That's it for tonight. Peace.

      Oh my _______! Its homecoming and opera week, which means every single person on the planet (okay, VSU planet) is stressed and overworked. Between Mozart, Sync Competition, Float design, Parade, Marching band etc etc etc every person I know is swamped with all sorts of stuff, alot of it useless (not Mozart - thats cool). This would not be a problem if it wasn't for this thing called MIDTERM. Now why on this green earth did the school overlap homecoming and midterm? I love being busy, but that is just nuts!   Why do we do this to ourselves? And by that I mean to do so much and to wear ourselves out? I feel that sometimes we should sit in the shade on a beautiful day like today (clear skies 70F) and have a picnic with our friends, and just enjoy life in general. We don't do enough of that. (Don't get me wrong, busy is good, but so is HAVING a life). Consider this a shout-out to all my buddies, and I'll give you a call in a month when I have a break longer than 30 minutes! No kidding, I have class, advising, work, class, band, parade, and then a gig tomorrow. Thats 9am to 10:30pm. I  guess I'll get some lunch and dinner... I guess. I look forward to the 8 to 9 hour work day WITH a lunch break. Wow, a whole hour for lunch? What is one to do?  "Live all you can; it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you ahve your life. If you haven't had that what have you had?... What one loses one loses; make no mistake about that....The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have....LIVE!" ~Henry James (1843-1919) The Ambassadors [1903]  That is an interesting thought... I sorta agree with it. I want to live and do good. I'm sorry, but to live and do bad just doesn't "float my boat", but its a free country, think what you will.   "Live and let live" ~Scottish Proverb  Okay... lets think about this proverb huh? Live. Okay, I take that as Live my life as I shall. "and let live". I'll take that as let everyone else live as they wish to live. WOW!What a concept... worry only about yourself. You know... that sure would solve a whole lot of problems in the college scene about "drama" and gossip. LIVE AND LET LIVE!  One more on life....  "Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact." ~William James (1842-1910)  I think that last one is great. Until later.... LIVE

      October 13, 2003  Well, I'm entering my 5th year in college. Actually "entered" is the wrong word. Its midterm, meaning that life here at Valdosta State Univ. could not be any crazier. Lets see, 18 hrs of class(by the way my major is Public Relations), Valdosta Symphony Orchestra Concert Manager, assistant for the European Council of the University System of Georgia at International Programs here at VSU, Blazin Brigade Marching Band, Sigma Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity for Women, and the Christian Student Center... yeah, its keeping me busy. I actually like being busy. First of all, it keeps me out of trouble. Second, if I wasn't busy, I'd be bored, and that's worse, and third, why not? I have the rest of my life to work at a desk. I may as well take advantage of all the things I can while I'm at college. Granted, I do spend alot of time at my desk, at my computer, but its okay. It is expected. On that note... I believe it is expected to be busy at college. Not just for the whole resume thing, but also for personal growth. I can't even begin to explain the changes I've had since I was an 18 year old freshman. I'll get to that in a later "blurb". For now, this is a start.

      "Whatever you do, you need courage.  Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to the end, requires some of the same courage which a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men to win them."  -Emerson  Or brave women!!!!  Its been a long few days, but nothing really to report here. More later this week!

      Ack! I'm sorry! Seems I let a little time pass since I updated. I would say I got a little busy, which is true, but this got pushed down to the "less important" category for a while. Well, no longer! I'm back!  On the 24th, I got an obscure message from Dad while at the Lassiter Band practice here at VSU. (Lassiter is the best high school band in the nation right now, about 350 marching, national champs) The message was very fuzzy, and all i could make out was "sister", "accident", "ICU" and "surgery". So I completely fall apart, in front of everybody. I called up Rick and he came through like a champ. Aren't friends great? It took 4 hours, but finally I learned that my sister was going to be okay, and that even though her injuries were severe, she was to be fine in due time. She ended up spending 5 days in the hospital. Mom and Dad told me to stay in Valdosta to pretty much stay out of the way.   Irene and Scott drove up from Florida, and the three of us got to hang out for the weekend. That was great. Definately a weekend of highs and lows. The Pops in the Park concert was that Saturday, and that was entertaining. Here's a big hand to my friends in it. Thank you to all the SAI sisters that came through and supported me, I needed it! SAI rocks! That covers that weekend. Its funny, you never know how much you love someone until you nearly lose them.   The following week was one of just complete craziness. Lots of class, lots of work. Thursday started the second orchestra sequence of the semester. Getting the stage set, the auditorium ready, rehersals, its alot of work, but its unique. We had two guest artists from Ireland. David Brophy and Fingham Collins. The first a conductor, the latter a pianist. It was truely amazing to watch a conductor conduct the orchestra without a score to read from. He had the score memorized. Amazing! The concert sequence went very well. 2 down, one to go!  That weekend was also Halloween, and in college fashion, we had a halloween costume party. I was too tired to do anything really fancy. So... I made a beauty pagent sash, dressed as a outdoors girl, and went as Miss Canada. It worked. We had a number of cute costumes. A quick list for the interested: Robot, a baby, the Hulk, Jack the Ripper and his Victim, the cast of Gilligan's Island, Men in Black, a devil or two, Pumpkin head, The four horsemen, the Matrix, etc. It was fun. Me, Rick, Miranda, Russ, Temma, and Beth went to Steak and Shake afterwards. It was great to chill with them.   The next day we had a football game. VSU lost. So sad. However, some guy in a monkey suit ran across the field. At least we got a laugh out of it all.  Well, I think thats where I am going to leave this for now.

      Okay, I lied in that last essay. I knew I would think of something. Dag from Norway asked me on a date to the fair my junior year... oh yeah, the hot Norweigen blonde soccer player... unfortunately, only one date. .. But I always had it!!!! Cheerio!

      Some random thoughts...   Seventy Four channels and there is nothing on.   As with TV - we always assume more is better. But is it? Sometimes more is just that, more. Clutter. It seems that alot of us have our lives so packed with activites, that we forget what its all about.     Why do we have Valentine's day?   I think its to fill the void of time between Christmas / New Years and Easter. Lets think about it... it provides us a chance to run to the super market and load up on more junk food than we should eat in a year, and oh yeah, if you are single you are shunned by our commercialized culture. All we need now is a day to celebrate the single life... think about it... Valentines: couples, Easter: cute children (ie family), The Fouth: Family cookout..., Labor: day at the beach with the kids, Thanksgiving: dinner with your family and then there is Christmas... again a family event. The only "single friendly" holidays out there are 1) New Years (but tough to get out w/ no date) and 2) St. Patrick's Day (where is the fun outside of Savanah & Chicago... (definately not much in Valdosta). Now some could argue that Marti Gras is a single's event - but the idea of flashing my chest for a collection of cheap plastic beads made in China just doesn't ring my fancy. What we need is a day where we celebrate the indiviuality of singles and allow for them to go out with no "hitched" folks around... Just my opinion, I may just be bitter at the moment.    This blog should be titled www.i-need-a-real-life.com.  Well, I did get to hang out with some friends tonight... that was fun.  Just some thoughts. Anyway... So, yeah I gave Miranda the "scoope" on me - actually the guy I've been interested in the last few years... I feel good about getting it off my chest... She is the first person I've told, and maybe she can knock some sense into either me or him. I talked to Martyne about "unfollowed apologies" by the one guy that has given me such hell. She said... "maybe he just had to get it off his mind, he knew he had done wrong and he had to clear his conscience." Why hadn't I thought of that... Makes sense to me.   I just had screaming thought crash into my brain. THE FORMAL!!!!!! Oh my god... BREATHE Liz.....! I have never, ever had a guy ask me to a formal. I have always asked. I really really really want a guy (that is halfway decent) to ask me out to this. I deserve it!  I am a good girl that just wants to be treated like all the other girls  that I see get asked out on a regular basis. When Kim and I talked after her breakup of Fall 03, she said she was asked out by 11 different guys... damn. That is about my life total. I have helped every roommate I've ever had get a date, and I have worked hard to keep other friends together - including driving to other cities to "chat" and "knock sense" into folks, holding heads while they were sick in the toliet because they had tried to drink away relationship problems, listened as they have bitched about thier ex, held friends while they cried, needed help with papers, school, family, money, car, GRE, Regents, proofreading, WHATEVER!!!! My God! I am tired. I think I need to spend some time on me!!! I have beaten myself silly trying to help others, and here I am, 22 and have yet to be formally asked to a formal (and believe it or not, I have never been formally asked on a date, as in "I would like to take you to dinner/movie/play/concert/ballgame." I have had alot of "lets hang out", "lets grab a bite to eat right fast" and of course the dreaded "would you please hook up with me" or "can we go to a bar". What the fuck? Do I have a tshirt on that yells SLUT? I didnt think so. That shirt lives in, well, i wont say it, ____'s closet. I never ever want another guy to come up to me at a party and say "lets go to my place [wink wink]".  Gary once said that any activity you have one on one with a guy is a date.. but I dont think I believe that anymore. Sometimes there is no intention of dating, but just to hang out for company. Just a date, just a date to the formal- thats all I ask.  Gosh, that was a fast vent. I feel better now... I wonder if, when I read this tomorrow I will agree with it all, I just typed very fast, spilling the first thing that came to mind onto the "paper".   Moving on... I killed a possum this week. I really feel bad for the critter. He had the bad judgement to cross the road in the rain right in front of me, I still feel completely ill when I think about - I can still hear the crushing bones. Ugh. No critter deserves that. Flash to today, I was driving back to the school from Wendy's when, on Baytree, there was car heading right towards me in my lane. I just came to a stop, as did the truck beside me... and I really thought this oncoming car would never see me. She did, and then swerved back onto her side of the road, missing yet another vehicle by what I would guess 7 inches. It really could have been a disaster. My question is: where are all those VPD cars when something like this happens? Some people do not need to drive... end of story.  College life... ITS SO DAMN CONFUSING.  Goodnight.

       PANIC.   What am I doing? Where am I going? Who am I?  Three very important questions, and I don't have the answers. What I am doing is trying to get a degree, any degree at this point it seems. Actually, the interdisciplinary degree is perfect for me. COMM, MUSC, and POLI. My top three interests... but the thing is I've gone into this mode of slack for some reason. Its midterm and I am finding myself leaving my backpack in the car overnight... not true with German though, I am studying that, but I didnt do so well on that test... what if I fail? That would mean taking only 3 hours in the fall... I cannot allow for that, yet here I am worrying about everything else.  Where I am going... I am going where the wind blows me right now... What I really need to do is take my life by the horns and steer it where I want to go... thing is, all of a sudden, now that I can see myself leaving Valdosta, I am scared. Where am I going? Who will be there? What will I be doing? Now, just like I was as a high school senior, I am completely open to ideas. Maybe I should have explored more options at that point. Maybe I should explore more options at this point, not to mention the time I've wasted the past 4 years...   Who am I? I am a person that loves excitement, a person that loves nothing more than being with close friends, a person that is smart when it comes to projects that I have an interest in yet a total slack when its something that is required of me, a person that loves to listen to others speak - and then I contemplate those comments, I am a person that would rather spend a quiet evening with friends than go to a block party - yet I also love those too, I am a person that loves to read, yet it drives me nuts, I love to work, I love to work with my hands, I like making things, I love to make and listen to music, I despise long hours on the phone, particularly with someone that lives across town - I'll drive over and chat in person, yet I will spend hours upon hours on the phone with friends/family that are no where nearby, I am a person that hates to be alone - but I realize that being alone is better than being with the wrong person - wonder where I learned that... I am a person that loves to be held, I am the person the can not stand to be blown off, taken advantage of, or even ignored. I am annoyed by slow drivers, bad computers, people that talk about me in a negative way, I am annoyed by the loud bass that makes cars rattle on the outside, and by red lights that take too long to change, I am annoyed by people that keep their cell phones on during "events" and when hanging out w/ friends, by this I mean, enjoy what you are doing in the moment, live the moment. I am annoyed by people that try to live the lives of others via gossip, (MIRANDA knows who I am referring too!), I am a person that cannot be defined by one word, although, I would love to know what my friends would say if asked what one word they would say to describe me...  Had dinner with Miranda, Rick, Ken, Robert, and Patrick tonight... Rick said something that I really liked. "I have wondered what it would be like for my social circles to mix, and now that its happening I don't think I like it." I have several social circles.  FIRST , the Music crowd. Which is divided into two groups that blend, the party crowd and the friend crowd.  SECOND , SAI. I sorta consider this a separate group.  THIRD , Alpha Gamma Delta. However, I have really changed since I joined them....  FOURTH , the Student Christian Center. I go Wed. nights for an hour for a Bible study. I'm not a Bible beater, but as I said, I like discussion, and it provides.  FIFTH , international programs.  SIXTH , VSO admin,  SEVENTH , Griffin friends. I do wonder what would happen if those crossed. Of all these however, I think I have 5 or 6 REALLY good friends... thanks guys!  Okay... I guess that's it for right now... I know I'm not done... but its late.

       I'd rather be tired than turn into someone who needs a life...   I took that from Rick's away message, and it really sums me up. I liked it, being the "quote junkie" that I am.   Thats all for right now... I'll get back later, and geesh, am I tired!

      Well shoot, I've been absent, perhaps just absent minded, for about... uh, well, at least the last few months. So, here is an update of everything! (Sorry to Miranda, Irene, and Jessica, because I know you are always looking for updates! Thanks to Miranda for the footprint on my butt (figuritively speaking).  Okay... well, the weekend after my last blog was an exciting one. I got to hang out w/ Jessica, someone I never get to hang with, but really enjoy the company of. Anyway, the we went out drinking from about 6pm to about 2 am.... and I discovered that evening that I really dont like getting hit on by crazy drunk guys, because all of a sudden my name became Rebecca and I was engaged! Oh the things that you will do when hit on by a crazy redneck who is about 40.   Then, the most signifigant thing that followed was definately  Thanksgiving weekend . Yeah, it was fun. Irene, Scott and I got to hang out Tuesday night like old times. What is sad, however, we were up before 8am (influences of the real world) Wed. morn. However, for the first time since.. uh.. who knows... I had MickyD's B'fast. Irene and I went up to Atlanta to see Pulse, A Stomp Oddessy on IMAX, and we both agreed anyone with any interest in international studies OR music should see it. Needless to say, I liked it - and I do hope it comes out on film eventually. Irene and I followed that with working the ATL Marathon & Half-Marathon and First Aid Volunteers, and then it was off to my house for a traditional Chewning holiday. Irene got an education in my family's traditions. We went to the tree farm to get a tree (actually 3 farms), and watched the traditional Thanksgiving night "movie that Richard gets to select because he thinks he runs the house", and of course, the Orchard Hill Lights. (NOT as fancy as it sounds!)  Then this follows up with  VSO . We had a successful VSO xmas concert. Mom, Dad, MC and Ryan (Hey! whats up?!) came to see me and the concert. I topped off the sequence by falling of the top riser and really f~ing up my back... pulled out the old back brace for about 2 days, just to let it heal.. which it did, no worries. (But I did scare HR when I told them about the fall - I guess they were freaked out that I was going to sue.)   This is followed up by a sequence of really  BAZAAR  things.    1) [Deleted for privacy]   2. I went to Clewiston!  This was a great trip, really, thats about what I can say. I went for Irene's concert, (first I might add, and really good), went to WPB to shop and see LOTR III. Whoo-hoo! I loved it. And then got to do a master class (!?) with her 6th graders. They are cute. We had a really good time, and I do miss seeing her on a daily basis. (hence, maybe way I'm going nuts afterall!)   IN THE MEANTIME  I move to a new apt. 900 Cherokee, Caroline's old place... I love it! And I get two cats too! Sassy and Buff! So sweet!   3. I totaled a snowmobile!  Yeah, so exactly how many people do this? Apparently, according to the insurance company, alot!. Yeah, so I was behind Richard, who never knew of it until we got back to "base" because he wasn't watching behind him... and Dad was behind me, dragging behind so he didnt see the event, but definately got to see the aftermath. Yeah... You cant steer on ice. On a path wide enough for one "sled" I hit a curve that was a sheet of ice, went into the plowed ice bank, and launched the 3 day old, 10 running hrs sled into two trees, effectively folding it. Very sad. Very expensive. Oops. Damn. Well, I could have been killed, I'm glad I let go once airborne! I landed correctly, flat on back! and Dad stopped before running over me, and Vladimir, the Russian who lives in Japan that vacations in Canada took pictures. The last ski track to the tree measured 8 ft... quite a ways when going 25 mph. Lucky chick I am.   4. Major Change!  So I get to my PR class to find that its canceled, and this is a very important class that I have to have SPR 04 to graduate anytime in any future. Noticing my extreme distress, Matson Topper (bless you!) suggested I go to Dr. Adler and see if I qualify for a GENS degree due to my massive hours in MUSC and COMM. Well... YES. I can get out by AUG! So, with a quick change, and adding German for my final language requirement, I just might get out a semester or two early! I LOVE DR. ADLER! By the way Jessica, I "name dropped" you so he would know that I'm not a total looser!  (meaning, if he knows we are friends, maybe he will think I'm a half way decent student - which I'm not!!)     5. GMEA  Really, what else can I say? Actually I got to see Denmon and Gunter which was really really cool. I miss those two. Denmon is quitting music! what the hell? Actually I dont blame him... 20 (?) years as a high school band director is probably enough! Also got to see Greg, Kyle, and Casey (love ya'll!)   6. I got kidnapped  by my best gay friend (I'll leave your name anon for ya!) and taken to a gay club in Jax. I had so much fun... total stress relief.    7. Jeff  contacts me and "cools things over". Weird... Wonder what will become of it.   8. Andy  Yeah I had a boyfriend from Thurs to Tues. Andy you're a great guy, but its not going to work, at least now... (waiting for Jessica to call - she'll want the dirt on this one!) This is what happens when you ask a girl who's been single (almost forever) out on Valentine's week. I kindly refer to this as my Britney Spears weekend. 'Nough said.  What else? I also went to Destin w/ SAI - that was a really really cool weekend. I hope we get to do it again! Feb VSO was great, except Stravinsky Ebony Concerto, that sucked! (not the soloist, the ensemble!) I love my new apt. I love the cats.   Here is my "deep" thinking... now that I'm done w/ the actual history of the last few months, which I'm sure I've left something out... sorry!  No... maybe I shouldnt say this...  well... shoot.  I am kinda freaked out that I am job hunting now. I'm looking at all these jobs and I dont know what to do. Options: 1) Foreign Service (If I actually am accepted as one of the 400 taken, from the 70000 that apply) 2) Fine Arts Management (where I really want to go) and 3) Peace Corps. I get upset being away from friends for two days.... TWO YEARS???? AM I UP TO THAT?  FREAKED OUT STILL.  Quotes:    Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.  ~Shakespeare   Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.  ~Earl Russell   So there are no more words and all is ended; The timbrel is stilled, the clarion laid away; And Love with streaming hair goes unattended Back to the loneliness of Yesterday.  ~Joseph Auslander  I think this is all for now... I'll be back soon - I promise.

Seems I've done something wrong once again.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   One day... That day was today.... 3 Tests 1 Presentation 1 Job Interview  Why do I put it all in one day?  Why do friends go nuts on me all in one day?  Why don't friends tell me what I've done that bother them?  Why do we hurt each other?  Why do we tear each other apart?  Why?

       I love my brother .  I got this random IM this evening from my brother,  Richard .  Richard: How would you like to see  ALEGRIA, a CIRQUE DU SOLEIL  show, in Atlanta on Aprill 9th? Liz: holy cow Liz: that is my spring break Richard: well you want to go? Liz: (that's a resounding hell yeah) Richard: bc I have a ticket with your name on it Liz: you are so awesome Richard: you will be round out the family five Liz: HOLY COW Richard: MC Me Mom Dad and You Liz: that is going to be so cool  I don't know how he manages to do and organize things like this, but he does a good job of it. I'm excited, I've never seen a performance by these guys, it ought to be great!  ~~~~  In other news....   1)  Don't get me wrong about  VSO  - I do love doing my work with it. What gets to me is the bitter/cranky/tired therefore I'll get fussy attitudes that performers [and others] get with me. I know when there is a problem, no reason to cuss at me, no reason to fuss at me, no reason to tell me that it must be fixed NOW BY GOD b/c... I know! Just tell me about the problem... and I'll fix it. For the love of god there is no need to yell at me.  END OF RANT.    2)  Regarding the hugs... does it maybe have something to do with reassurance? I think that might be part of it too. Keeping in mind I only hug best of friends, maybe subconsciously I am reassured by hugs that they are on my side. Sounds strange perhaps, but that is probably part of it.   3)  I am tired of my  Leadership and Conflict Management Class  of getting canceled. Yeah, that's right. It is canceled so often its not even funny. In the last two weeks, we've met a total of 2 hrs, and its a 3 hr class.    4)  I WASHED MY  CAR!  Those that have seen it know how much it needed this. Did you know that my car is blue?? I had forgotten.  Take care, Goodnight.   "Mishaps are like knives, that either serve us or cut us, as we grasp them by the blade or the handle. ~ James Russell Lowell (1819-1891)

      Several things to mention tonight...    VSO  The runout went well, all things considering. Moving 15 risers up flights of stairs, 65 chairs, 70 stands, multiple stand lights, tympani, instruments, podiums, and all sorts of other stuff is not really what I consider fun. However, I am proud of the stage crew for their work. I was impressed that we actually got everything moved and set-up without damaging anything. I say this because of the shear weight of it all. I have several bruises, but my right hand hurts like hell. The thing that does piss me off regarding VSO is how I am expected to work from 9am to 9pm straight. Granted, I don't perform, but the stage crew performers were given a break whereas I was not - and that was the hardest work of the day - mainly setting up little bullshit items such as stand lights (I know they are important, but its tedious work that receives only a rare thank you) and main stage lights. The latter would not be such a big friggin deal if I did not have to run back and forth between stage and booth. I lost count of how many times I did that. Another thing that I resent is how I am the person that everyone goes to to complain. No one goes to Harding - b/c of the stereotypical he is the scary boss thing; no one goes to Plondke b/c he is too stressed to deal w/ complaints; no one goes to Topper that I know of b/c they want to be rehired. Therefore, they come to me, and I'm fucking sick of that right now. I must say that I got quite a charge out of the fact that Plondke did forget his score today - a problem that had the potential to make the day miserable. However, it was quickly fixed, and the show of course did go on. The day, for me, was miserable. Joe, Robert, and Dr. Collins made it much more bearable for me, yet I would chose to not ever go through with that again. Basically said, I caught alot of crap today.   "Just to let you know, she's a huggy person."  That is how my friend  Rick  described me today. I know I am, however, one thing I must say in defense in that is I only hug people that I really care about. I can't really help it. I don't know why I do this... but I think it has stuff to do with how I grew up and particularly my early year(s) at college. Used to be I never ever gave a hug. I could count on one hand all those not related to me that I hugged in my life. I never mean to offend anyone with a hug, but know that when I offer it I am offering everything that I am to a friend...  That's it for tonight.

       "Fudge is good, Stage Crew is bad"  ~Andy Baxter   Isn't that great? After VSO, the stage crew sat down in the dimmed Whitehead Auditorium and ate the left over reception food after striking stage. We have alot to transport this time, being that we have a 150 choir and a 65 orchestra - and the concert site has no chairs or stands.   VSO was definately interesting. Everyone was walking on eggshells, and yelling - rather strange combination. I did not see Dean Gaston - which is very unusual. He is usually first in line to get in.  I will save you the pain of the evening. What I will say is that overall we did put on a good show - it would have been a great show if we didn't have to repeat it all tomorrow.  I am very tired. Very, very tired. There was something that I wanted to write about, but I can't remember it. So....   Goodnight.

      Okay, two clarifications on the previous post.  1) I would be good at selling AVON, and I appreciate  April's  confidence in me, I just don't have time.  2) I don't have PMS, it just seems that everyone in VSO does.  I have been reading alot of live journals written by people my own age (college age that is.  I have found a number of startling similarities.    1)  Everyone feels lonely.   2)  Everyone feels that they are not living up to their potential.   3)  Everyone has emotional baggage from the past.   4)  We all want to be successful.   5)  We are all tired of college politics.   6)  We all want to find the perfect someone...    7)  We all feel that life could be better.   In response to these , I wonder about "us". About how far we have come, or not. Actually, many of us should not be lonely - we know plenty of people. So, what is the problem. I think that we are just making ourselves too busy for each other, and needless to say computers don't replace human interaction - no matter what.   Also, why aren't we living up to our potential? I think alot of us are, we just don't think we are living up to our  parents "wish list"  for us. I actually talked to an ARMY recruiter yesterday (to learn about the military for the FSE), however, I did learn alot of other things. I liked the attitude of ARMY, and I even believe that I would like it, if nothing else, for the structure and security of it. We have to take an initiative on our own, we have to find something that "drives" us.  For me, it is the FSE, I have found something that I really want - and I want it bad.  I have not worked for anything quite like this except my second barrier. (the music folks know what I'm talking about).   We need to dump the emotional baggage. Sounds so easy, but its not - we all know that. I talked with  Brad Owens  the other night, and in response to this subject he said "it is in the past, I don't see any reason to worry about anything". If we can all learn to do this, then as a whole this entire world would be "healthier".  We all want to be successful. That makes sense enough, but what constitutes "successful"? It is different for all of us.  We are the only ones that will know that will work for us individually. No one can tell you what will make you happy.  Money or love of the job? Power or independence? Computers or people? Prestige or just a job? There are so many different things that make us "tick".  What I can say is that we must, absolutely, do what makes us happy.  We have to tell our parents that we are happy with that choice, particularly if they are not. I know that I want to improve our social environment, now whether that is through arts administration, running Walgreens to supply medications to a community, or serving my country in the FS as a career I have yet to figure out. I course, I hope to start with FS.  College politics. Have I said enough? I hope so.  The other two, the perfect someone and a happy life (or "life can be so much better") can, but don't necessarily go hand-in-hand. I don't believe in a "perfect someone" but rather, "the perfect type of someone". The details on that is a whole other topic I'll write about on another lonely Friday night.  The happy life part will come when we get the other previous topics mentioned going in the right direction.    So that is my rambling for now on that.  On other topics I went to dinner w/  Miranda  and  Rick , and then became sick. I tend to stress myself out on VSO weekends, and this is not uncommon. I feel that I absolutely perform perfectly for the administration. I compete so hard with myself it drives me nuts. I am a perfectionist in so many ways its scary. The worst thing to me is [negative] criticism. Trust me, I give myself enough! There is one faculty member in the COA that everytime has something to say. I will never ever be able to please this person [this person not on VSO admin].   Oh well. On nights like this all I want is someone to cuddle with. That would be so nice. I might write more later, but I need a break.   I like the following quotes, so here they are. (Not really related to today's rambles of Liz -but just interesting)   "Talking and eloquence are not the same: to speak, and to speak well, are two things. A fool may talk, but a wise man speaks." ~Ben Jonson (1573-1637)    Love, unconquerable, Waster of rich men, keeper Of warm lights and all-night vigil In the soft fact of a girl: Sea-wanderer, forest-visitor! Even the pure immortals cannot escape you, And mortal man, in his one day's dusk,  Trembles before your glory. ~Sophocles (495-406bc)    This one I really like, and agree with.   "Mine honor is my life; both grow in one;  Take honor from me, and my life is done."  ~Shakespeare

      Grrrr, they have changed the blogger web site. This means I have to start over figuring out where everything is.  Yesterday - the day of mixed blessings.  1) Good: JumperCable Rental (VSO Truck place) has everything ready for the VSO.  Bad: I rear-ended another car on the way back to school.   2) Good: Car isn't damaged. No police report needed. Bad: I was late to class any my nerves are shot.  3) Good: I understand  SPSS  programming for COMM 3800 Research. Bad: I was late and missed the statistics part of the lecture.  4) Good: We got the  stage  set. Bad: Because Plondke didn't check the schedule to make sure we had the stage at the earlier time, crew got an hour and a half late start setting up the stage.  5) Good: We finished the stage. Bad:  Plondke's  not happy with it.  6) Good: I saw  April Holstrom  (AGD). Bad: She thinks I would be good at AVON (what she is doing) but - Like I have the time.  7) Good: I formally have a job interview w/  NYLIFE  in Columbus. Bad: Its really not the job I want.  8) Good: I talked to the  parents . Bad: They want me to do what they want me to do.  9) Good:  Shaun  called, interested in hanging out Friday evening. Bad: I have VSO  10) Good: Passed  German  quiz. Bad: I'm still not doing well in there.   All I am doing these days is stressing out. VSO really isn't helping. We have this "last minute craziness" and everyone seems to loose their brain and get PMS all at once. Oh well... I knew this would happen.  More Later.

       The chess board is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature. The player on the other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is always fair, just, and patient. But also we know, to our cost, that he never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance. ~Thomas Henry Huxley in   A Liberal Education    I talked to  Scott  today, and the topic of the conversation was "the past", meaning how do we learn from the past, what has our past (which includes our choices) made us who we are today. Overall, it was great. We also talked on matters of life, friends, us as individuals. I liked the above quote because it was just interesting.. and sort of on the topic of "past". I'm glad I have you for a friend Scott!   What else? NY LIFE called again today, Yipee, a job possibility.   I failed a German test... Big time failed. STRESS  Got a new book, this one on National Security... ugh, it better help me out with FSE. Speaking of which..went to a state dept. lecture here at VSU. Very interesting, and very invigorating. The State dept is of course, the sponsor of FSE.   And finally, talked to  Irene  and  Miranda  . Here's a shout-out to you both!  I have alot to do, so I'll write more tomorrow!  BYEEE.

      What the hell is going on?  I'm just confused right now. Thats all really. I hope this will be short blog.  First, the waiting game sucks. Will  Shaun  call me? How long does this take? I'm not so good at traditional dating -- never had practice at it.   Second, apparently  Rick  thought I snipped at him. I didn't mean to if I did. I was just like "well, ok, I thought I would give you a call and see if you could hang out but it seems that you have made plans already." If I were to "snip" the whole world would know.  Third, had a chat with  Sam  tonight about a number of topics, including but not limited to senior recitals, receptions, actions, words, feelings, friends, exes. The more I get to know him the more I wish I had made an effort befriend him earlier in college. He has alot of good things to say. To him I say "Long time actions speak louder than short term words, so don't stress."  Fourth, had a quick but meaningful dinner with  Miranda  and  Rick . He was much quieter than usual. Don't know why.... strange. I guess he is in a quiet mode today, I have those occasionally.   Fifth, it seems that I have truely broken  Andy's  heart. He commented that  Beth  was urging him to ask me to the formal. I was shocked that she was trying to interfere, and responded with a "are you serious?" and "why does she keep interfering?". However, being that we were chatting via AOL AIM the connotation was completely lost, he took it as I had no interest in him at all, which of course, then upset him and we had a few harsh words said. That is why I do not like using IM as a primary source of conversation. I don't know if I could have gone to the formal with him, I just don't know. First of all, I have other possibilties, second, I do have that huge CIP (Center for International Programs) event that night, and third, the more I talk to Andy the more he seems totally depressed and he surely acts like the world is out to get him. This bothers me because he is a nice guy and the world really isn't out to get him. So, I worry about him - alot. I'm not worried in a "he is going to show up to school and blow everyone away" type of worry, but rather a "he does have alot going for him why isn't he responding to it better?".  I know that I absolutely crushed him in that I am not dating him - I'm sorry Andy. You need to take care of yourself before anyone else - and please, please, take this as concern from me - and nothing else.  That is all for now really. I'm just confused and why everyone is just being weird. Hopefully things will improve tomorrow.   Now would be a good time for a quote on confusion, but I don't have one right now...

      I just had a wonderful feel good moment today. I was just checking up on some random friend's live-journals/blogs and I found that my friend  Jerry Roberts  wrote about me in his journal, saying some of the most wonderful things an old friend could say. I never knew that I had made a difference to him, but, according to this I sure did. I sure feel good right now.   ok, so the title is a lie, nothing of any interest happened to me when I wrote that title, but by the time I got back to my journal entry to finish it, I had something to talk about. So I talked with Liz tonight. She's on old friend, the first really good friend I made in High School. She was the first person that actually made me feel like, if I tried, I could work myself out of the social catastrophic state/malcontent with life that I was somehow mired into from Middle School. Dirty Middle School years. Well, turns out Liz is coming to A town in a couple weeks to see a fellow VSU pal. So briefly this got me reflecting on what I really accomplished in High School. Ok, not really yet, but as I'm lying in my bed tonight, waiting to be whisked away into that fabulous world of sweet rest, I'm sure the topic will be on my mind.    I just had to share that. This reminds me that we never really know who we are influencing on a day to day basis, and sometimes we dont know how much good we are really doing. There is hope for us all yet.    We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them . ~Thucydides(460-400B.C.)

      WOW.  Lets start from earilier this week... had a great time with  Irene  in town... we had some very late night talks about all sorts of girlie stuff. Also, got to see  Keith (and Miranda),  always a pleasure. I'm glad that he is surviving student teaching... I wish we could hang out more... but we are both very busy people. Its fun to hang out with  Miranda  at the lab. I wish I had a job where friends could visit me once in a while - albeit  Justin Monday  did come by the office for actual class related stuff... I think he was surprised to see me. A quick hello, and it was back to paperwork for me. Anyway, back to Wed night, after the lab,  Irene, Miranda  and I went on over to  Rick's  to see him and the cat. We drove literally around the block, and then got caught by a really slow train, but thats okay because it gave us something to talk about, and the goal of the evening was to hang out. Then later it was off to Denny's. Hanging out with you guys is so much fun!  Skipping alot of shit, class, homework, work etc... we move to Thrusday night. I got a phone call from a fellow named  Shaun  (Shawn?) who is in my Interdisciplinary Senior Seminar class, and he asked me if I was interested in going out to a movie or something of the like Friday night. HELL YEAH! So, moving on to Friday night... El Toreo and a movie. Overall I had a great time! I think we really clicked. He said he would call tomorrow - I hope for a second date.   Thats it for now. I hope to be writing good news tomorrow night.

      What a day I have had. (Disclaimer: I am very tired, please excuse any typos you may find in this essay)  First,  Irene  is in town.... just like old times really, except now we are juggling 3 cats that really don't get along that well... an adventure.  Second, VSU Career Day . I met with alot of different reps, and learned alot of different things. What I have never thought about was retail management. While this is not what I want to do long term, Walgreens basically threw a Jax job at me that starts at 43K. I have another interview later this month, and I very well might get it. Three students from the entire fair were asked to come interview, and I was the only one for the Jax position.  Mom  said "Liz, this isn't like anything you've ever thought about doing..." Yeah, I know but it is something! Still not optimistic about the  FSE , and the fact that I have little experience doing anything - really, I need to consider all options.   Third, Advising with  Dr. Adler.  I wish I had known Dr. Adler my freshman year. The man is pure genius. He knows the university inside and out and all advising situations as well. We have done a course substitution for GENS 4000 by using BUSA 4800. When he asked me for an "official" defense of the substitution and heard what I said, he commented that was one of the best defenses he had ever heard. I guess I'm doing something right. I then made a joke about being an advising nightmare, and he commented that I really wasn't, that in fact, I was very interesting because I have actually tied my three areas of study together. How cool is that? The director of the Honors Program called me "very interesting".   Then I went out to hear  Rick 's Northvia play. Possibly for the last time - but I understand that for him it might be for the best.  Irene  commented that it was good to see people her own age... I guess I'll find that out next year right? I got to see  Danny  , who I hadn't seen in a very long time... that was really cool. Hope to see him again. Also got to see  Miranda, Staci, Bill, Jerry, and Patrick . Good to catch up with them all and see that everyone was doing well.   Overall, this was a good, however, very exhausting day.    Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate. -JFK

      Greetings everyone.  Its been a few days hasn't it? Sorry. Life gets in the way sometimes...  I've had a few good days... where shall I start? I am preparing for the foreign service exam (I'm not really optimistic about it, only 400 of 70000 are accepted), I just want to try. I am currently reading a book about Madeleine Albright (former Secretary of State) and her foreign relations policy. The book is a beast, but I rather enjoy it. If you are into really heavy reading about policy, it is the book for you! I am almost done... I am proud of finishing this one... wonder which one I'll start next...  I've been so nervous and stressed here lately about all sorts of topics, not limited to graduation, job and friendships, that I am practically having to take PeptoBismol (sp?) everytime  I eat... It sucks. I don't know how much more my poor stomach can take of this.  Nothing really new over at Fine Arts. Same old drama. On a good note - I had dinner with  Keith  on Friday night. It had been a while since I had seen him and it was good to catch up. I miss seeing him on a daily basis at school. We always have a good time hanging out.    Irene  is visiting this week during her spring break. I worry that I won't be able to hang out with her as much as she expects. I have a really full load. I got to talk to  Scott  this evening... always good. I miss having him around here. Consider this a shout-out to you! Finally, seems that  Rick  has something up his sleeve... he keeps talking about this "big secret". I can only imagine....   We have a VSO meeting coming up Thursday (damn it! I knew I had forgotten something). I'm stressing about this one b/c of the equipment and transportation issues that we are going to face this go around. My goal: keep Harding happy. Note to self: buy stock in PeptoBismol before VSO weekend.  That's it for now.

      I think the last few days or so have been the best of my college career academically - or close to it. I am on top of the game... I am making amends with old broken friendships, I am happy.   Seems to be random, being that its midterm and I am stressed out... but looking at it, i cant complain - at all. I have found a better person inside of me, one that I thought had died along time ago, Well ladies and gents, I AM BACK. I am on fire.   Just a quick few thoughts...   Organize, manage, network, motivate, and ensure that I deliver what I promise.  That is what college should be all about academically. Organize life. Manage life. Network professionally and personally. Deliver to myself and to others.     Five years after coming to VSU as a kid saying "who am I, what am I doing here", I am a young adult. I have acquired a precious circle of friends. I am about to graduate having done things I thought I could never do. I hold positions within the university that I thought I never could. I have found the strength of my own voice and I have found a special place for Valdosta in my heart. I have learned to seize the opportunities and defeat the perils I face, I must be more than an audience, more than the actor, I must be the author of my life and take control... In the fairy tale, it could end here.. In my life, it's merely the beginning of a new chapter.   I can be anything I want. Good luck and best wishes.    I am excited... bring on graduation.

      Jobs.  I'm off searching for jobs. I guess everyone has to do it.   Speaking of work, two medical emergencies at work Monday. That was very unusual.   I love hanging out... I came to that conclusion tonight after hanging out with Rick and Miranda. There should be a major in that.... I would graduate Summa Cum Laude, or however you spell it.  I really dont have anything deep to say right now. I'll try again later. Otherwise, goodnight.

       I am hereby sorry for any and all grammar blunders. It is needless to say I have skipped many a class in 22 years.   Ok, 'nough of that. Something happened today. Not really sure where to start... oh yeah... how about when I got up? I woke up feeling like a new person. Looking back on previous blog essays, I must have been in total PMS mode or something... or maybe now I have just now caught up with sleep, therefore causing me to feel like a new person.  Today was amazing. I just did little normal Sunday things, but for the first time in a long time, I was happy about it.  Maybe it has something to do with rest, sunshine, rest, having a cat to play with... no... thats not it. REST. Yup, that is the reason I feel renewed. This was the first weekend that I had absolutely no demands placed upon me...so all I did was sleep. Seems elementary enough.  I just feel like turning on the radio (more likely a chosen CD) and just singing at the top of my lungs... (Be glad you are reading this, not watching this!)   I think that is just what I will do.

      The FSE is now over, for this year.   The  Foreign Service Exam  was Saturday, took 7 hours, and alot of stress. All I can say is that it was hard, very hard - but I'm rather optimistic. I would love to discuss it further, but I had to "swear" not to disclose any information, and writing about it here would most definately do so.  The drive up was completely uneventful. It was very nice to see my  Aunt Mary  (being that I took the exam at  Emory , I stayed with her, being only 15 min. from there).    MY MOTHER DRIVES ME NUTS . Okay, here is the "gist" of it... I was supposed to hang out with  Jason Royal  Saturday night (in the long run it had to be canceled - however that is not what this entry is about.) I told Mom that I would be out very late, and I would not accept any curfew. She replied  "There is no curfew as long as you are on the premises" . WTF??? What the hell does that mean? How the hell can I have "college fun" at my parents house - that place so often is a prison. What would we do there... uh.... watch a movie? eat ice cream? play with the dog? talk about college life in front of the parents? I don't think-a-so. So I pushed her a bit more to see what was going on, and basically she said,  I WOULD HAVE A CURFEW . Here is what I don't get:   I'm 23 I've traveled Europe on my own I have two jobs I'm in college AND SHE WANTS ME TO HAVE A CURFEW???   GRRRRRRRRR. No wonder I didn't have a dating life in high school. A note to all parents out there, when your kid is 23, NOOOOOO CURRRRFEW!  UGH. As you can see, this has really pissed me off.   ON ANOTHER NOTE:   I almost adopted a puppy this weekend.  She was sooo cute. I finally decided though, I really do not need to get a puppy on finals week. (Irene, you will be glad to know she was not a large breed dog.) Man, if my mom gets upset over curfews, I can only imagine what she would have said about a puppy.  Before I left home, Mom decided to "check my tires". Of course, they had to be a few pounds low, and by the time they were fixed, an HOUR had passed. Grr.   As I left my parent's house on Sunday, I passed my neighbor  Preston . I pulled over to say hello (suburbia-life). She said to me,  "All of a sudden you look so grown-up".  Hm.... Do I look old? I thought it was sweet, at which point I told her to mention that to my mother next time they see each other (hehe).    YAY!!!!!!!!!! The FSE is over!    Thats it for now.

       Conflicts of Africa. Conflicts of Asia. Conflicts of the Middle East.  See a pattern here?   This is stuff I'm working on right now... currently on China. Its so much more than you ever wanted to know. Anyway, I'll be done with this on Saturday after the  FSE ... for about a day, then its back to class.   Alot of good stuff going on for me.    I'm doing a presentation called  "Persuasive Elements in Music and How to Understand Fields Outside of Your Own."  I'm doing this for the COMM dept next week. YIKES. Basically I will be showing persuasion students how to go about learning a subject to create either a convincing argument or propaganda. I am the only student in the class with a working knowledge of another academic area, so I was selected to do this (on music).  I've had alot of random compliments here lately. I'm just tooting my own horn, makes me feel good, and I need it!   Work  is going very well. I processed passports/photos/accommodation files/etc today. I'm getting to do more of the fancy stuff here lately. Its cool.  Jill  and I had a lovely chat today regarding our work-study assigned student. He's not exactly the "best example" of an employee.   TOEFL  is being awesome regarding this credit card fraud. YAY!  I had a lovely time hanging out with  Miranda  this evening. We both fussed about what was getting to us, and I think we felt better afterwards.   Talked to  Gary  tonight. I MISS HIM!!!   The one major thing that went wrong today was poor  Irene  had a student threaten her life. Be Warned Future Teachers!!!!   That's about all. No big quotes tonight.

       How is it one day can have so many highs and so many lows?   Class went well, and then I went to work. I walked into my office, and Jill (who I share with) looked up and said to me, “David needs to see you immediately”. Of course, I’m thinking, “Great, what have I done now?”  David is the assistant director of International Programs. As he puts it, “I do the busy work”. I believe that is true to some extent. I mean, the director gets to do all the cool stuff, and the busy work just trickles down. By the time the work gets to me, its usually photocopying, making telephone calls, and basic recruitment. That’s fine with me, its easy work, a lot of work, but easy.   Anyway, David asked me “what do you want to do after graduation?” Quite a bit of out of character for him – being that we have a very professional friendship. However, this conversation was taking on the feel of a “Daddy” talk. We talked about jobs and education, both his and mine, and it turns out we are very similar. Both BGS degrees, both signed on w/ the Air Force at one time (except he actually did it, whereas I dropped), both of us like travel, and both of us hate Valdosta (He went to VSU) It is in his opinion that I should get a job teaching English as a second language, in another country for a year – just to get out of here. Is it really that obvious how much I can despise this town?    Many subjects later and one hour later , his phone rang, to which he said, “I guess I should get back to work”. He returned to what he was doing, and I went back to my office. Jill asked, “what happened??”  I know it doesn’t sound like much, but it is at least to me it’s awesome that I know someone (non-relative adult) out there cares. And that’s all I did at work today!  Then, it was a quick dart over to the theater dept. for a staff meeting on “A Final Farewell”. I’m asst. stage manager, getting some much needed theater experience before I leave VSU. Then, a dart home to change, a dart right back, SAI, then VSO honors concerto. It was a loaded evening.   I’m involved with too much. I need to cut back.    Moving on… it seems that  someone has stolen my credit card info . I wonder if it was someone at work. Among things purchased were 2 TOEFL exams... something that we require our students to take....so I get to call that office in the morning, and get the name of the registered students, and then I’ll run a cross-check against our databases, and we’ll see what happens. I’ll keep you updated.    I just want to give a big shout out to my friends, and thank you guys for being there for me!!! You have no idea what it means to me.     Do not set your heart on wealth... Do not strain to seek increases, What you have, let it suffice you. If riches come to you by theft, They will not stay the night with you... They made themselves wings like geese,  And flew away to the sky. ~Amenemope

       Just stay sweet, you’re good sweet, it suits you. That is what my friend from high school  (Matt)  said to me this evening. He is totally removed from Valdosta, so he’s a great confidant. In conversation with  Martyne  this past weekend, I said “I’m a touch chickie”, to which she agreed, “Yes you are”.    So, why do we tear each other apart? I think it boils down to a few simple things.     1) FEAR  – When we fear something, we get defensive. Why would anyone fear me? I think that it is because I’m a very strong person, I know a lot about them, and I’m smart. I don’t always act smart in public, I actually put myself down a lot, but if you doubt it, ask me a question on Middle Eastern Politics or policy… ask me a question on music theory, ask me a question on communication, ask me a question on US Gov’t., the list goes on, the fact is I’m very diverse, which I commented a few entries ago and I think it bothers other individuals. People can fear for stupid reasons….    2) LACK OF KNOWLEDGE  – When we don’t understand something, we also get defensive, we put up a shield to protect ourselves, or we just ignore it. Sorta ties into #1. Also, goes for personal background. For example, there are people out there (you know who you are and if you are reading this, good, maybe you’ll grow up!) who do not understand me. They do not understand why I am the way I am… Yes I am a Christian, and I do drink. Yes, I am conservative, but a thing like dying my hair red doesn’t phase me at all (reference to the formal). Yes, I am a student, however, I am close to several faculty – and you know what? I think that gives me an edge. Yes, I have done some crazzzy things, such as party till dawn and then some, I say have said some crazy things, I have taken some crazy trips, however, I have never compromised the well-being of another person (except for Wes, but that’s another story :-D). All of these things cause cognitive dissonance for individuals, and when a person experiences this, they want balance, so they seek it. Sometimes, this leads tearing another person down.     3) Power  – When someone in power feels that someone else can take over that power, of course it is going to lead to “conflict”. This is pretty simple really. Knowledge is power, people fear the powerful.     4) Self-Assurance  – When someone feels that they do not measure up for any reason, they often tear down another person to make themselves feel better. We’ve all heard this, particularly regarding high-school cliques. When someone feels inadequate, they need self assurance.    5) A sense of accomplishment  – This one sorta goes back to #4. When all else fails, it is simple to tear down someone and feel empowered.     6) Miscommunication  – Look, when you feel that there has been a miscommunication, go to that person immediately, fix it ok? Fix it fast. Fear, knowledge, power and TRUST all play into this one.   I don’t want everyone to like me. I don’t expect that to happen.  I just want everyone to accept me simply for I am.  (This of course goes to others, accept them for who they are... no matter what...) This doesn’t mean that you have to like me, or whoever, what it means that you understand/comprehend that they are who they are, and you do not destroy them for that.    Things cannot always go your way. Learn to accept in silence the minor aggravations, cultivate the gift of taciturnity and consume your own smoke with an extra draught of hard work, so that those about you may not be annoyed with the dust and soot of your complaints. ~ Sir William Osler (1849-1919)    Look, sometimes shit happens.  We do things that piss each other off, we step on a toe, or we just plain hurt each other. Who will be the bigger person? You? Or them?  Sometimes things aren’t fixable, and there is pain. Tell them…. Let them now… move on…. AND ACCEPT.   My blog is entitled “REFLECTIONS ON VALDOSTA COLLEGE LIFE”. This is indeed a reflection of college life, and life in general.  I do love my best friends, and I'm so glad to have you!  BTW, Thank you  Irene  for the flowers!!!  Hope you got something from this – above and below.   Days, how many days Do I have until I am set free to a better place A place of love A place of no tomorrows   Hours, how many hours Do I have until  I am set free to a better place A place of no misery   When will you believe me When I say these things to you No likes a liar baby No one at all When will you receive me  When I say these things to you  ~~~~~~~~  My TV and You It’s the only place to be Nothing else to do Nothing else to see A room without a view Has so much for me and you I was born to stare At stars on ceiling walls  It’s all I need It’s all I ever needed Until the world is gone  Take me how I am ‘cause you know I’ll never change I was born to stare At who stares back at me  If I make it up To that big show in the sky All I really want  Is you  It’s all I need It’s all I ever needed

      Okay, moving on to this weekend   AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!    SAI  Initiation was first, Saturday morning. All went very well, and I love the new girls.  Then we had  SAI Lunch , and that was alot of fun. I think  Dr. Goode  was amused by my  Brashier  story... If you haven't heard it, ask me sometime. Its hilarilous.   The Center for International Programs 'International Dinner'  was awesome. Every year it gets better, and this may have been the best yet. Entertainment included the international wardrobe fashion show, and Asian Martial Arts. My bosses were surprised by my "red" hair. (okay... I put a red streak in it for the formal - it looked very cool)  The  SAI Music Dept Formal  was truly awesome. If you were there, you know what I'm talking about, if you weren't there and you are in the dept, shame on you, and if you aren't in the dept and weren't invited, I'm sorry. A big hand for Martyne for planning, and Matt Elder for DJing. I hope that SAI does this again next year.  My  Birthday  party, after the formal, was definitely alot of fun. A "small" group by definition of my past parties, but it was very awesome. I had more fun Saturday (4/17) than I had had a very long time. Thanks everyone!!!  that's it for now. Peace.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      (Written Friday. I've had some technical difficulties here lately w/ my blog, pardon the last week's errors)   Strange things have been known to happen.  So today, I went to the CD store in the mall (FYI I think - I'll know for sure when the credit card statement comes in) and just browsed. What originally took me there was VNV Nation. I was hoping to find a CD of theirs. Its a long story, but basically I bought a mix CD in Austria in 2002, and one of the songs was by VNV Nation. After doing some research about them on the web, I decided to see if I could find a CD in the store - basically just to get a sound. The lyrics this band has are awesome - found on the one CD I do have; I quoted them in my last entry. Anyways, I found that VNV Nation is not findable - in Valdosta. Which, of course, led to general browsing of CDs. I was there, so why not look? I found a curious looking used CD for 7 bucks. The name:  VAST for (Visual Audio Sensory Theater) . The name alone beckoned for some research. Fortunately, the store allows for listening prior to buying, which is exactly what I did. I like the basic 'sound' so I decided to splurge the $7 and get it. Being the dork that I am, it was in the car player before I left the store.  I was soon to be amazed by what I had discovered by accident.   The song lyrics are basically from the point of view of hurt, lost, and confused characters.  Seems to me that any college student who has lived could have written them.  It was truely amazing.  Here are some quick examples:   every time that i cry out no one ever comes to me every time that i reach out no one ever rescues me i wish i could hide from every one is there somewhere else to be take me in i want out that's all i need i wish i could run from every thing   ~~~~~~~~   i cant tell where you lust ends and where your love begins I didnt want to hurt you baby I didnt want to hurt you   i really didn't love you baby i really didn't love you but i'm pretty when i lie you hurt me baby i hurt you i didn' want to hurt you baby [x4]   ~~~~~~~   The music itself is pretty awesome too.  Its tone reflects the lyrics. I particulary like the songs "Pretty When You Cry" and "You". So, of course, I hopped on the web, and low & behold, there is a whole series of CDs by this group... guess I need to go to work and earn some more dollars.   ~~~~~~~   My how the times have changed.   This Saturday night is the music dept. formal. Years ago, in high school in preparation for prom, I started months in advance. First, dress, then date, hair, makeup, dinner, transportation blah blah blah. I also wanted to "fit in". I had to have the cool style dress, the cool ride, the perfect date, perfect hair etc.  Lets see... I bought a very unique outfit for 20 bucks for this weekend, I know no one else will look like me... I'm going stag, my car, no "pre-dinner", I'm doing my own hair (which will be unique), and my own make-up. Grand total spent on this formal: $25 dollars. However, I think it will be awesome... I will be in top form, and I think many will be surprised by my look, but that's all I'm saying for now.  ~~~~~~~~  I really don't have anything more to say at the moment, I guess that can be a good thing. I mean, geesh, my last entry was a book. I did not direct that entry to any one person, but rather, it just reflected how I was feeling when I wrote it, which was definitely, "pissy". I do think I said some good things, all of which I still believe.    The Future...   something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.  ~~Clive Lewis (1898-1963)

       We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them . ~Thucydides(460-400B.C.)   HOWEVER, THERE ARE TIMES WE AS INDIVIDUALS MUST ASK FOR AND ACCEPT FAVORS.  ~~~  Thought these two songs were interesting... kinda self-reflective right now. I'm discovering the use of song lyrics to understand how we are not alone. From  VNV Nation .   When I have nothing left to feel. When I have nothing left to say I'll just let this slip away.  I feel these engines power down. I feel this heart begin to bleed as I turn this burning page.  Please forgive me if I bleed. Please forgive me if I breathe. I have words I need to say. Oh so very much to say.  And whose life do I lead? And whose blood do I bleed? Whose air do I breathe? With whose skin now do I feel?  I'm supposed to walk away from here. I'm supposed to walk away from here.  And whose life do I lead? Whose blood do I bleed? Whose air do I now breathe? I'm convinced there's nothing more.  What am I supposed to do? Is there something more?  The engines power down. Like a soldier to his end I go. Because I'm convinced that there is nothing more.  and whose life do I lead and whose air do I breathe? With whose skin and whose blood do I feel?  What happens now? Have I done something wrong?  Forgive my need to bleed right now. Please forgive my need to breathe But I've so much to say and it wouldn't matter anyway. You're not here to hear these words that I must say and I'm convinced inside that there is nothing more.  Whose life do I lead? Whose air do I breathe. Whose blood do I now bleed? With whose skin now do I feel?  I have nothing left to say. I have nothing left to feel. Am I supposed to let this go now, let darkness come and take me away?    ~~~~~  Eyes betray the soul and bear it's thinking. Beyond words they say so many things to me. A stranger here reborn it seems awaking wonders deep in me. If nothing's ventured nothing's gained so I must seize the day.  And fighting time so hard I pray that this moment lasts forever. And will the world stay standing still at least for me. Through my eyes stare into me. I bear my heart for all to see. With my face turned to the sun there ever standing still.  It wasn't you it wasn't me it wasn't anyone. It was a day so long awaited and a chance to be as me. I let the wind run through my hands as I turned to walk away. In distant days I long to sense it all so clear.  And fighting time so hard I pray that this moment lasts forever. And will the world stay standing still at least for me. Through my eyes stare into me. I bear my heart for all to see. With my face turned to the sun there ever standing still. And fighting time so much I ask. I will this morning last forever. Though seasons change and things come to pass remain inside of me. And fighting time so hard I pray that this moment lasts forever. and will the world stay standing still at least for me.  I had no faith before that day in any vow or deed. Days followed days and years were meaningless. Despite the wisdom of defeat I bore my heart for all to see the wonders I'd seen.    ~~~~ Having a long talk with Brad Owens tonight. Alot, if not all of this is based off of that conversation. Here it is..    In my humble opinion...  People look for certain traits in people.  I think people seek traits in others that are non-threatening to themselves... for example... so where alot of individuals see me as independent, that scares them. In this geographic area, girls are "groomed" to be submissive, and guys, particularly, in my experience, want that. Either that regarding traits or people that seek other people that are similar to themselves are less likely to bring themselves into a highly self disclosing atmosphere. People like others like themselves because they don't have to tell them as much, so they don't get hurt as often, or at least they think this is true, but they should find people that are different to befriend b/c when people are with people that have the same problems, dreams, goals, etc they usually do not like the things that they are going through, this translates to the relationship or friendship being negatively intimate and the dislike of things within their own life bleeding to the other, leading to a dislike of the other person.   I find myself in a situation in the great cycle, that is we are completely different form model number to model number, and the struggle to understand what others are trying to convey or either what they are thinking is so often missed.  I think that people just don't "get" me..  I'm so diverse... it bothers people that I have several layers... several interests. As it was said in Shrek, I'm like an onion, I have layers, I can be a very hard person to grasp in one simple swoop. Pardon the cheesy analogy to Shrek.   We are all still searching for the  TRUTH . Logos (logic), Ethos (character) and Pathos (emotional appeal) are elements of rhetoric (the analyzation of speech and artifacts). We use logic, character, and emotion to find ourselves and whatever it is we are looking for.  We describe, reveal, conceal and prescribe things for ourselves all the time.  We describe to ourselves what we perceive to be reality. We reveal what we want others to know, we conceal what we don't, and we prescribe ourselves remedies or senerios all the time. This is how we deal with day to day life.   We carry morals, ethics, and personal motives. This goes back to Jarrett's essay on morals. We are all different. Some of us believe that sex before marriage is wrong, others believe that its ok. Some of us believe that we must not cuss, others don't care. I believe we have to do what makes us happy and what works for us, as long as it doesn't hurt ourselves or others in the process. What befalls us so often is that we don't check with others before we do something. What do you do if lines are crossed in a relationship and the other person is distraught while you are not? How do you confront them? Do you even confront them? What do you do when someone blows you off? Do you lose your cool or are you higher than that?   I think that one thing that we must absolutely work on is competition. We are drilled from the time we are babies to compete. Whether it is competing with siblings for a parent's attention or for equal rights among each other, or in an audition in a musical ensemble, or a political office or for a promotion at work, or simply to be popular, we compete.  Competition is okay ... what is  not  okay is when we take it home and compete with our friends for whatever. We don't need to do this because in the long run we end up  tearing each other down.   We compete for all sorts of junk, but think about it,  what do we really need to compete for on a personal level? Really? Why do we get upset when good friends go out with someone new? Or someone we know? Are we jealous of them going out? Are we upset that we may not be the front-runner for a relationship anymore? Are we upset that we may not get the time we believe we deserve in the future?  So many of us need to take a "chill pill" and just be "loyal as a dog" to our friends.   Lets start there... I wonder what would happen if we all did just that?    The possibilities are endless.

      Greetings.   A mid-day entry... WTF right? German was canceled... made my day. My paper on  "Using Feminist Criticism in Rhetoric to Explain How the Film  G. I. JANE  Resists, Challenges, Maintains and Transforms Patriarchy"  will be in  VSU's undergraduate research journal . Cool huh? If you actually want to read it, give me a shout... its too long to clutter blogger with.    Wind Ensemble  played well last night, props to those of you in it. Got to go out with  Miranda  afterwards (thx girlie! I needed to hang-out!). Congrats to new SAI officers.   Anyway,  Jarrett  wrote the following for a class of his... and I thought it was interesting... so here it goes...  ~~~~~~  Morality is relative. There is no universal law of morality that governs the land. There is, however, a basic human right to LIVE and to LIVE the way they want.   You must be taught morality from the time you're a small child. Aside from learning the morals and ethics of society, you must learn to respect the morals of OTHER societies as well.   It is the job of the people to question the moralities of the time. Is what they do truly just? Are there standards that are being met, or aren't being met? If there needs to be a change in the society in which you live, then push forth the change. If you have lived in that society, in that moral structure, and understand it well and feel it is unjust, then it is reasonable, logical, and moral to push for a change to the better.   However, it is wrong to go to a different place to try to change them. For instance, our coming to the Americas and forcing the Indians to change, our going to Hawaii to "give God to the Heathens!" and stuff like that. They're not heathens for believing what they want to believe, and have believed for thousands of years. It is not our place to say the way they think is WRONG.   The moral, legal, and human rights of an individual may not be levied at any time. They have the right to live, unless some fault of theirs, whether morally or legally, has caused otherwise. (IE: Murder.)  ~~~~~

      Okay.  I can breathe once again.   My 2 1/2 statistics test is over. I didn't leave anything blank - which is a miracle.    I think it goes without saying that I "bit off more than I could chew" this week.  However, all that was planned, from VSO to the Statistics test (and more - see previous entry) was out of my control. I broke down infront of  Dr. Young  today - and I think he understood of what was going on. I was so sick in his class that I had to leave twice... he asked me what I had, and I told him, "Stress".   I've been kind of a bitch to my friends lately, and  I am so sorry  you guys. This week was definitely in the top five for most challenging academic weeks. The only others I can come up with are F03 and S03 Finals, F03 and S03 final senior papers, and perhaps 2nd barrier.   This week's highlights include a Huddle House adventure with  Rick, Jerry and Debbie,  hanging out individually w/  Rick, Miranda  (at the lab),  Shaun, Belecha  at Denny's, talking to  Patrick, Scott and Irene  on AIM, going to  Sam 's recital, and seeing   West Wing   (my very favorite TV show). Also had a GREAT presentation for  Dr. Magnasco's class Persuasion Theory , I also have been doing alot of reading for the  FSE  - as usual.   Things at the office have been rather hectic lately, but now that the boss is in London for a month, we might actually be able to finish long-over due projects. The one that I must finish is a new web page banner for  International Programs   urlLink (www.valdosta.edu/cip) . Once done, the new banner should go up in a three or four day span, so keep an eye out everyone.  A very sad note, my cousin   Brandy  had a miscarriage this week. Please keep her and her husband   Brian  in your thoughts and prayers.  I guess that's it for now.  Spring break  is coming up soon, and I don't know how I am going to handle putting up postings for that yet... I might do just one long one at the end, or go day by day like I do now... just check back occasionally, I know that I will write about the break somehow somewhere.  Take care, Goodnight.

      Summertime. Bored. I took this cute little quiz.     Your element is Water: Understanding, intelligent, quiet and calm. You know who you are and no one can change that. Usually quiet but only because your listening, don't let anyone think you haven't got an opinion! Your not quiet because your shy or sad, your usually quiet because your thinking. Your answers are well planned and helpful so people generally seek your advice. Your the perfect balance between solitary and outgoing. But sometimes you need a little time to yourself to sort out your emotions and figure things out. You understand the phrase 'sticks and stone' and rarely let things get to you, whats that important for you to have to get so upset over? You know what you want out of life but are simply taking your time and enjoying things. To you your life is fine as it is, you can always change things later if your not happy.    urlLink   .:-|What is your true element?|-:. -With Anime Pictures and detailed answers-     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I've had a number of random thoughts here lately... I hope I can remember.  1) Its amazing what we know automatically. Think about it... I was driving around the other night and flipped on my brights - that was when it occurred to me that I didn't even think it, I just did it. We do that alot. We all have our different things. Musical instruments, computers, language, vocational skills. Kinda crazy.  2) Stop and enjoy the sunshine once in a while. Its simple really - but I actually did it today between classes, and it felt so good.  3) Celebrate a good grade, at this point they are far and few.  I have had alot more, but that's all I remember for the moment. If you have a random thought, post it. Later.

      So I just watched a new movie... "Chasing Liberty". Its about the daughter of the president and her European escape w/ friend. Ya know... I found that I can relate to that movie. Everyone wants to find love... and sometimes we find it in the most unsuspecting of places... for the girl... "Anna", she found it in a Secret Service agent. So, what does this mean for me? For you? I dunno really, but I will go out on a limb and say maybe it means we should look in places that we really don't expect to find love. Maybe we should look beyond the "first date" as a possible love opportunity and look to our very daily life. Is there someone in it that loves us? Its crazy. Keep those eyes open. Good luck.

      Ugh. Fridays during  Maymesters ... I usually feel like crud because I'm so tired. I had a massive  Global Security Policy  Exam this morning, however, as bad as that sounds I'm rather optimisitic about it. Lets see... topics covered were rogue states, Korean Policy towards the West and ViseVersa, China's anti-foreign policy advances, India and Iraq's new governments and types of terrorists and how to profile. Its a pretty awesome class, its just alot of info. The test was all essay, so my hand is now rather tired.   In reading for this class, I have found a rather interesting website written by an Iraqi citizen. Here is a quick exerpt. I found it VERY interesting. It is written by a girl who goes by the alias  Riverbend .   And through all this [bombings, torture cases, shootings],  Bush  gives his repulsive speeches. He makes an appearance on Arabic tv channels looking sheepish and attempting to look sincere, babbling on about how this 'incident' wasn't representative of the American people or even the army, regardless of the fact that it's been going on for so long. He asks  Iraqis  to not let these pictures reflect on their attitude towards the American people… and yet when the bodies were dragged through the streets of Falloojeh, the American troops took it upon themselves to punish the whole city.   He's claiming it's a "stain on our country's honor"... I think not. The stain on your country's honor, Bush dear, was the one on the infamous blue dress that made headlines while Clinton was in the White House... this isn't a 'stain' this is a catastrophe. Your credibility was gone the moment you stepped into Iraq and couldn't find the WMD... your reputation never existed.     If you wish to read more (and there is plenty) the URL is http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/   Anyway, back on this continent called  Valdosta , life is going well.  Scott  drove through town last night and it was good to see him. He seemed rather "chipper" to me, and it is always good to see friends in a good mood.   However, yesterday was not the best of days for others. I know  Irene  had her end of the year concert, and from what I understand it went well... just stressful.  Rick  had another "incident" with his car... not really sure what yet. I know it involved a ditch.  Eric  ran out of gas and upon returning to his truck realized that he had locked his keys in it, and  Stephanie  had some sort of water pipe break under her house.... I hope that all of you are okay - let me know if I can help.  In other news,  Caroline  returned from her vacation cruise yesterday. Seems she had a very good time.  Gary  successfully defended a client at his intership (law office) so he was excited... good job Gary.  Brad  moved half of his stuff to Peachtree City... to finish next week. Thats it in a nutshell folks: Valdosta.  I'm rather amazed at how pathetic some students in college really are. I witnessed four presentations at the school on Wed. and they all were total shit. I mean, geez folks, this presentation is 25% of your final grade, go ahead and ace it so you can have a good grade... not to mention respect from other students. My presentation on National Security will be on Tuesday... so I'm actually about to get started with that when I'm done with this.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Because I'm bored... Also you can actually learn some things about me from this...:   1.

      Well, I've had a good day.  Today I went to see the  Brad Paisley  concert at Wild Adventures w/  Miranda   and then stayed to see the laser show. I had alot of fun - definitely needed to do that. We then followed that up with the ultimate of chick flicks,  Love Actually . That movie gets me every time I see it. What can I say? I'm a hopeless mess. Overall though, great day! Thanks Miranda for dragging me out!!!!  Wed-Friday afternoon consisted of PANIC. Finals suck - and I had alot on the line. Ugh. Sometimes I let these things get to me too easily - and sometimes I'm a fool and beat myself over the head with them. Oh well. They are over - this time.   Friday evening was nice. I went out w/  Caroline  and her friends. Don't usually get to hang w/ them - and they are a cool bunch of folks. Also saw  Andy  while I was there - thanks for the hug Andy! Red Lobster was followed up by going to  Relay for Life  w/  SAI . It was fun - but I was really too tired to do anything productive other than hold a flashlight for the others. Some of the guys came out to support us, and that was cool. Thanks to  Eric  and  Abadia  (spell??) for dressin' in drag for all's entertainment - and thanks to  CC, Rick, Jerry and Phillip  for coming out too. Sorry if I left someone out. While there I had a meaningful conversation with  Debbie  and  Ashley , glad I did - its good to keep up w/ friends.  I then came home to find a party at my neighbors - so I chilled w/ them for a bit, and then my roommate  Caroline  , boyfriend  Jeremiah  and brother  Edward  got home. The four of us chilled out for a while, and then it was me and  Edward . We stayed up rather late just hanging out. That was cool.   Over the last few days:  Debbie : it was great to see you at the UC - best laugh I've had in a while.  Jarrett : you keep me sane more than you know!  Irene : I'm sorry I woke you up!  Scott : thanks for the email!  Caroline  and friends: thanks for taking me out!  Miranda : Thanks for the great day!  Rick : Thanks for the hug!  Andy : Thanks for the hug!  Justin : Thanks for the hug! (hehe, I like hugs!)  Dr. Coons : Thanks for scaring the ever living hell out of me (sarcasm) regarding expulsion.  Its possible I left someone out.... if so, I'm sorry.   CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE THAT GRADUATED TODAY!!!!

      Whoa. A whole lotta stuff has happened. So much in fact I have not had time to write (obviously right?).    1) Cheating Scandal   It goes like this. The Oral Comm Class was behind in lectures and time was running short, so the class taught by  Dr. Coons  met at 7am to have a two hour lecture. The front wall of the classroom was completely covered in easel paper with notes, and the dry erase board was also completely covered with notes. That class left at 8:55, and my class came in immediately for our class w/ Dr. Coons. One stupid girl and a sidekick decided to write "cues" on the board among the notes for our exam. She wrote, he stood guard. The rest of us were in such shock we did nothing. The prof returned w/ the exam, and we started. The prof copied the notes from the board to have what the class had.... and found the cues. Not saying anything, she ran to  Cates  office (dept head) and mass media to get  Frank B  (film prof). In her absence, another fellow ran up to the board and erased what he could. They returned, and turned on the camera, to find mostly erased notes.... Cates said that those responsible for the cheating would not graduate from VSU. The exams were collected. The class left. A few of us remained and told the prof the "who's" to protect ourselves. In this case, honesty was the best thing for me to do. The  Institution Review Board of VSU  recommended that the entire class be expelled from the univ. Dr. Coons decided that was a bit excessive - and is now pursuing punishment for only the 3. The class did lose points from the exam - which I must say was deserved. I may have to go to  court  to witness for the class, b/c there is more than likely going to be a number of law suits stemming from this - and being that I did witness already I am in the hotseat.  Not a fun week.    2) VSO   Two  VSO  concerts, and my last. While I will say that I often bitch about VSO, I will miss it terribly. It was a truly fantastic concert, probably the best I've ever heard. The problem was however that the AC died on Sat. morning.  Sawyer  theater next door was at an astounding 86 Degrees F during our theater tech run through, and I'll get to that in a moment. With a full orchestra and an enthused audience, things in Whitehead got hot fast. Theater, the attorney managers and I, AND  Dr. Harding  called Plant Operations to get the problem fixed to no success. When  Dr. Zac  (univ. pres.) got there, Dr H and I approached him and told him to get it fixed ASAP b/c our crowd really can't take heat like that. Meanwhile, I'm running around to get things fixed & done wearing a business suit BURNING UP!!! It was extradinarly hot. The AC did, however, come back on during intermission.  Thank God.     3) Theater   I was asst. stage manager for  "A Final Showing"  - which was a improvisational theater show involving lights, music, visual art, dance and rhythm. that was created by a faculty member  (Mr. Pat) . We had our tech run through in Sawyer in 86 F heat on Sat., and the show was on Sunday. The show was an awesome 3hr success. It was truly amazing. However, towards the end, the stage crew - not used to moving concert grand pianos, ran the damn thing right over my foot.  OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was really cool to work in the theater dept, and I had a blast.  SAI  and  PMA  performed on the last number, a non-traditional percussion ensemble. We had a post party at  CJs . What was really funny about it was that when I sat down, already injured, the chair gave way and down I went. Oh well. Everyone got a laugh, and that is important.    3) PARTY!!!!!!!!!    VSO stage crew [Me, Beth, Jonathan L., Andy B., Amy B., Todd, and Russell Brown as guest]   had a party. A $150 bar tab at Vito's. Holy cow!!! We then went to Bill's Bayou and partied and danced there, and then went to  Prof. Todd's  house to watch  Something About Mary . Awesome, awesome night.   4) Another PARTY!!!!!!!!   We had a party here at my place after VSO. [me, Prof Todd, Debbie, Jerry, Kevin, Lainey, Laura, Ken, Andy B, others??? - I don't recall] I can never ever just come home and crash after a concert - I have to unwind. Anyway, I had alot of fun.  SouthPark  the movie was on, and there is nothing like  semi-drunk music people singing along to the entire movie. Then, we brought out the guitar and sang to oldies as  Prof Todd  played, and then we moved on to making/writing sexual poetry on the fridge.... hehehe. Hilarious. Anyway, it was a blast, and I have moved into a whole new realm of partying because you know it rocked when you have faculty crashing on your couch!   5) SAI Stuff   SAI had a sister social on Thursday, yardsale on Sat. morning, and senior farewell on Sunday. I didn't think the farewell would hit me as hard as it did. I love you girls!!!!!!   6) Job Shit   I lost my job... yeah my beloved job at  International Programs  is no more... However, I must add that I am first on the "re-hire" list. The reason I am out is b/c there is absolutely no money left to pay me with. When the new fiscal year starts, there will probably be more money. That will be mid-June at the earliest.    7) Senior Presentation Comm Arts   Basically, it is what it sounds like, and I aced it! YIPPPEE. Thanks to  Toni  for letting me use her class as the "guinea pigs".   8) Persuasion Theory in Music   Did a special lecture. Went very well - I can't believe I pulled that off!!!!   9)  Other notes   Had a great dinner with  Debbie, Martyne, Melanie (SAI Mel)  at the UC. Thx  Deb  for buying! Great convo w/  Martyne  - played 'the soulmate game'. Apparently  Jarrett Glass  is my soulmate.  Caroline  is in town, and living with me, or am I living with her? Either way, she's here. Had dinner with  Greg Doke , great to see him! Went to  Miranda's  new apt., its awesome! Bought a new book, Glenn Beck's The Real America. I'm really looking forward to reading it, I love his radio show. I think that is all........ I know I'm forgetting something.    Irene : Hang in there!  Jarrett : I'm happy for ya!  Martyne : I'm doing the Happy Dance for ya!  Scott & Rick:  Where the hell are ya?  Toni : I thank ya!  Russell & Greg : Good to see ya!  Miranda : Great apt!  Mr. Pat : Great show!  Liz : GET SOME FUCKING REST!!!!!!!!!!!!

       There isn't much that can inflame me.   That said... let me tell you story. I went to Books A Million this evening for a number of reasons... but none of which that are important to this. Anyway, I bumped into a person that is in my Executive Branch/ US Presidency Class. He told me I should buy Clinton's new book "My Life" because Clinton was a fantastic president. To this I replied, "Nah, I've got too much reading going on now... I'll catch it later." We then got into a discussion about Clinton vs. Bush... and then he said...    "America can not afford to elect a woman president."    If you know me... you know this pissed me off.  I asked him why did he think that? He said "women can think rationally only about 32 weeks a year, not 52, and their hormones are out of control once a month.. and by way, add to that Eve  (!)  was manipulative and secretive so now women can't be trusted. I then asked him if he actually had a girlfriend, which amazingly enough he does. Now, I agree that not every person is cut out to make it as president but come now, to judge all women now from an event that was on the dawn of time (and this is if you believe in the Old Test.) is absolutely ridiculous. It is because of men like him that people like me are held back to positions that we do not to be.. we will keep running into that glass ceiling as long as our education system allows for this kind of thinking to continue. ARRRGHHHH! I was rather amazed that he had the gall to even say that to me... knowing my position on "women's rights".  Now, let me add to this I firmly believe that men and women are free to choose what they want.  Either can stay at home, either can work, go to school WHATEVER! However, it is up to the individual to decide and to let their "significant other" know. It is our responsibility to be honest and truthful to the ones that we love. Now, if I ever date someone that doesn't want me to fulfill whatever it is I want... knock me on the head. Its okay for someone to say "Liz, you wouldn't be a good president because you don't have the skills due to your education" but its another to say "You can't be president because of Eve."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I've had a rather peaceful weekend. Nothing too dramatic... Other than road rage and hateful debates.  One thing I will add is that I'm going to start documenting my "single thoughts" that I tend to have throughout the day and I'm going to write on them... I know alot of them are interesting at least to me... and they show who I am, but like those fantastic ideas we all have in the shower, if I don't write them down I forget them...

      Okay, I know my driving sucks sometimes... but that does not mean you have to honk at me and flash your lights at me.   Basically, I pulled in front of a driver at the intersection of Norman and St. Augustine, cutting his path short... It was storming and I simply didn't see him. Its not like I did it on purpose. Anyway, even after we had both stopped for the red light, about 5-10 feet later he just continued to honk at me. After a few frustrating moments I decided to just get out of there and I turned into Mc'D's and he even kept honking at me after that!!! Geesh. The car looked just like Patrick's but I know its not him. Anyway, angry drivers suck.

       Jarrett  came into town last night with his sister for her VSU orientation. Since they had no place to stay they stayed with me... and given that it was his birthday we threw him a little party. I had a great time, and I hope that everyone else did too. I was kinda surprised at who didnt show up... I had invited a large number of Alpha Gams, none of which showed. Oh well... those that did show up seemed to have fun. Apparently my neighbor wasn't there, to which I say "whew".  I talked to Scott two days ago... we talked about my possible moving down there to find a job. I think I would like it there, despite the heat. I know if he can handle it I can. I just don't know where I'm going, or what I'll be doing. Rather scary if you ask me!

      Ugh, what a day.  I'm just tired of running around. What's new right? Here are some random thoughts.   First: Davis  and I are hanging out even more now. I'm not so sure what this is going to lead to... or if I'm even totally misreading the situation. I think he and I will have to talk tonight because I'm confused, and chances are if I'm that way he is too.    Second:  I think people need to just get over themselves and move out of the past and into the "Now". Come on folks, I mean really. Why do we just bang our heads against the wall only to cause a headache on top of a heartache?    Third:  I need a drink.   Fourth:  German is almost over. I ended up with a 69 average, and geez... the prof would not up it to a 70 and just call it done. I have to watch two German films this weekend and then write an essay on them. I hope they are good. Oh well...  We must do what we must do.     Fifth:  I wonder if Debbie has fallen off the ends of the earth. Are you out there?   Sixth:  Grunt, I really don't want to drive to Griffin tomorrow.  That's it for the moment.

       Jessica Simpson moment #1.       Liz: You must put the car in park before turning it off.   Things have been rocking along pretty well this week, save a few Jessica moments. Anyway, class is going well - albeit rather boring at times and work is non-existant. I did however, land a summer job pet-sitting my German professors cats for the entire summer, which is cool being that she is going to pay me $12 a day for it. Seems rather high to me, but I'm not arguing. It would be stupid to do so.    Jessica Simpson moment #2.      Liz: You must turn on the car to get air conditioning.   I'm going home this weekend just for a night to perform for my Dad's best friend's retirement. Miranda is going to accompany me - which is really cool b/c we'll get to hang out and perform together - being that there are two horn parts.   Jessica Simpson moment #3.      "Liz - You must put the name of your town and zip code when asked by the univ. for        your home address. Duh.   What else? I don't really know what to call it - but I'm sorta "seeing"(?) a new guy. Actually its Davis. He's been stuck in this town b/c of his job and we've been hanging out... alot. He's my friend from home and we bumped into each other a while back. If you want to read about its in the blog - a few entries back. Anyway, its really cool and who knows what will become of this.   Jessica Simpson moment #4.      "Liz - Yes, Zaxby's does accept cash"    I talked to Richard for the first time in a while - he's in Boston prepping for his Pacific oceanography sailing venture. He's loving it - and I told him to pet an orca for me.  Went to a party on Monday night. Kevin was host. Kevin, Jordon, Ken, Curtis , Joseph and Rainer were there. It was cool - I needed the party.   Well, that's it for now!

      I've been doing alot of thinking and "projects".  First of all, lets cover what all I've been thinking about.  First: President Reagan passed away this week. Its made me do alot of thinking about how I want to live my life. I want to lead a life of purpose - I want to make a difference. I may not do something as great as bringing down communism and the Iron Curtain, but, I feel that there is alot that I can do. I can't even begin to explain how bad I want that job with the foreign service. I feel that I'm setting myself up for disaster by thinking about it all the time, but as any person who has suffered through a real crush understands, its just one of those things that will not easily leave the mind or heart. Another thought on Reagan is that he reminds me of my paternal grandfather. They looked somewhat similar, and they suffered the same ailment. Anyway, as much as I love school, its time for me to graduate and move on, and to make a difference in the world. I hope that next year this blog will be called  "Liz's Reflection's on Life in an Embassy" . Even if its not, I will do something to make a difference... even if its as small as cooking people breakfast at a fast food joint. If I'm not contributing to society, please come and knock me in the head.  2. I've either been really up or really down here lately. There are times I feel rock bottom. For instance, this afternoon I saw  Jon  and  Kim  working for  GHP & Brague . I don't know why, but I felt absolutely shitty afterwards, and it definitely wasn't to their fault. I dunno what it was... I imagine it was because I remember a time when I was close friends with both of them and now we barely even speak. I know that friendships change and move on but there are times when it just hits you in the gut. Its not that I miss Jon, its just that I miss being in the company of two fun and great people, for they are in their own right. I can remember doing things with Kim back in the day and having alot of fun doing it. Sometimes they act as if they don't want me to exist... that is how it was today. Both of them were rather kept their distance and seemed to reject me. I really did nothing wrong to them in my opinion, if anything, I have been the "best secret friend" for Kim. I have kept back and not interfered, that would be just plain childish. Maybe I'm delusional in wishing to be friends with them... I'll probably regret writing all this. I see Jon as a friend and Kim as a sister. Oh well. Things and times change.  3. On a happier note, there are times that I absolutely feel on top of the world.  Today I couldn't walk from Martin Hall to West Hall with out being shouted at by someone I knew every few minutes.  I mean, that was really cool. I have never been a popular kid. I consider myself as a girl that no one wants to dance with but a rather a girl that has an alright personality that overall everyone can get along with. Recently I have had moments when I have felt that I was on top of everything.   4. Its cool how many people I really know. As far as true friends are concerned, I have a lovely handful. But as networking is concerned... all I can say is Damn. I had to trot around campus alot this week. Here is a short list of people that randomly (or not so randomly) bumped into and had a conversation with.  Adler Gaston David (Starling) Stellemacher Brague Tina Karin Marie Levy Peterson Winder Leeks Barnbaum Noll Baun Josh Gary (Sigma Nu Gary) Rick (from class) Becky (AGD) Megan Ms. Amanda Anna  And these are only  folks that were  RANDOM!  Its makes me feel good that all of these folks stopped and took the time to speak to me. Its a bit of an ego boost.    SO ON TO MY PROJECTS   Okay, I've got some things going on this summer.   1.  I am trying to learn German.  I know it sounds crazy, but I really want to learn another language. I want to be able to communicate. Comes w/ being in the comm dept I guess. I just think people that can speak two languages are cool. I remember meeting a student on the program last summer who was a model. I thought she was beautiful of course, but I really didn't give her any credit. We were later traveling around London and met some college students from Russia, and without any prompting, the girl started speaking Russian. I couldn't believe it.  Here was this girl that I had "labeled" ditzy and she was fluently speaking another language - and a hard one at that.  I was very impressed and that was a changing point in me. I decided that I no longer wanted to label people upon meeting them... I have to give them a chance to prove who they really are. I want to learn another language. I was told years ago that being able to speak another language was like having two souls in the body. How cool would that be?  2.  I am trying to learn how to play the guitar.   Danny  is helping me out with this. For 5 days into the project I'm actually doing pretty well. Its easier to practice than horn. I usually just sit and indirectly watch TV and practice chords and scales and stuff. I have to change the strings on it, and once I do that I think I'll be able to notice an improvement in its handling. I want to surprise my folks when they get here and I can play a few songs on guitar. They have no idea I'm doing this.  3.  I'm reading a book called Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos.  Its about astronomy and physics - it has nothing to do with romance as the title might imply. Actually the lonely hearts refer to the lone scientists that are trying to solve the mysteries of the universe, of being, of existence. I want to improve my "mental game" if you will and I am going to do this through reading. I actually love reading, I just have to make the time to do it.   4.  I am working on my knowledge of music.  By this I mean I am up-ing my daily listening and such. I'm tired of being behind of everyone else on this topic.   Overall, I am trying to improve myself intellectually. You always hear folks saying "I want to lose weight" and so forth. Nah.. not me.  I want to add weight to my brain.  I want to be smart. I want to be ahead of everyone.   As far as activities go, here is what I've done this week.  Study Sleep See advisors Job Search Sleep Eat Sleep Stretch Sleep Eat  Sleep  Just kidding. While I have done that I have also gone out to hear some local bands in Remerton w/  Danny  and I have also hung out with  Rick . My friend from home  Davis  is still in town so we got to hang out last night and that was fun.     Overall its been a good week.

       Its been a crazy week!   So what has happened? Let's start with the beginning!   1)  Last Friday I went to Athens to see  Gary . It was a great weekend, and it was just like old times again. Friday consisted of just hanging out at his apartment. Saturday was packed full with fun stuff, including going to O'Shay's Pub. Its a nice little pub that attracted "the older" crowd of college students... basically over 21. Yay, no drunk 18 year olds hanging around. We then returned to the apt and went to the pool. I had to leave the next day *frowns*, but it was overall a very nice trip and it was great to see him again.   2)  Danny  called me up and told me he was going to be performing at  Mellow Mushroom  on Monday night, so I went out there to support him. While I was there, I ended up bumping into a high school friend that I had not seen since High School.  Davis Chappell  and I were in the advanced academic program together for years. We hung out all night, and I then went directly to class. It was great to see him, and I'm glad to see he's doing well. We reminisced about the old days and were thankful they were over. The crazy thing... he lives next door to Gary in Athens... its a small world. It was truly awesome to see him!   3) VSU never ceases to amaze me.... My Summer Session II class " Intro to the EU/ POLS 4830 " via WebCT actually was a session I class. Thanks VSU for the notification! (SARCASM) The class is hosted out of Augusta State Univ. I caught the error while hanging out w/ another student from my Global Security class.. we took it imediately to the dept. head and of course, he was amazed at what was going on... he definately helped us out though, however we are still having problems w/ getting things sorted out. There are 5 of us from VSU involved.   I know that doesn't seem like much, but add to that 6 hours mayterm plus one 3 hr directed study... yikes!  So basically, I'm taking 12 hrs Mayterm.         Happy Birthay Irene!

        I'M GOING TO DISNEY WORLD!    The famous line is almost always used by some athlete after an event in which he/she has set some record. I am using in a same sort of fashion in that I'm going there after graduation. However, I am not going for "fun", rather, I got a job there.  That's right everyone,  I'm moving to ORLANDO!  I believe I will be certtifiably OUT of Valdosta on August 18th. Its an interesting feeling... leaving Valdosta.  I regret to say I won't have that "2 month chill time" that I really wanted though. I was looking forward to moving to Ft. Myers for a while and just enjoying the beaches and the company of  Irene  and  Scott . [Apologies to Scott.] However, after six months of being a peon for Disney, I can really become anything or go anywhere with them. Last night, when talking to Mom, I teased, "Hey, wouldn't working at EuroDisney be awesome!" She teased back, we paid five years tutition for you to be a Donald Duck. Well, no offense, but I'd rather be a Nala, for she is my favorite Disney character. Why? She was the true heroine of Lion King. It was she that went out into the unknown to find help. I think that can definately be looked up to albeit a fictional story.   I had my last final this morning, and I feel very good about it. Folks start getting here on Thursday evening/night and graduation is of course on Saturday.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  As you can see, I have now set up a chatter box so we can talk via this website. So far its been alot of fun,  and I encourage everyone to use it - even if you are some random reader. [I'm curious... are there any random readers I don't know of?] Anyway, I've been trying to add a picture of Nala on the page too - and as you can see, I have yet to be successful. I'm going to keep working on that!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Well, folks... its time to party. 10:30 Saturday, my place. I'm finally graduating! YAY!

      I am so excited right now.  I don't know why, but right now I'm LOOKING forward to graduation. I have so much to do before then but I know I can handle it. As long as I grab my POLS final by the tail and swing it into the direction of an "A" I'm happy. I'm looking forward to seeing my parents, my sister, Irene and hopefully Scott. Missa and Gary said they would try to come, and Blair might even come. We shall see.   I'm still worried about what is to follow graduation. I so want that Disney job now that the FS is out, but I also REALLY want to go to Ft Myers for a while and CHILL OUT! Conflicting feelings... everyone says its normal, but ARRRGH!!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I got to talk to my brother tonight!!! SO EXCITING! We are what I consider very close and not being able to talk to him for the last half month (or so) has been driving me crazy. He's doing a research sailing expedition in the Pacific. Well, today they went into a port and he had the opportunity to call the family (all of us) and we got to chat for about 20 minutes or so.     http://www.tahsisbc.com/blog/2004/07/tall-ship-to-visit-tahsis-in-july-2004.html   If you go to that website (via copy and paste) you can see his ship. He talked about how he had seen dolphins riding the waves along side the ship, the humpback whale that surfaced right next to the side, the gale/storm they went through, and even what it was like to ride the bow and be plunged into the surf. I'm really excited for him.

      Have you ever read "The Whipping Boy"?  I can't remember who wrote it, but I remember reading it. Basically it goes like:  There was a Prince, and the prince was very bad. but because he was the prince, he could not be punished. So a servant boy was selected to be whipped in place of the prince to make the prince feel guilty.. only he never did.   There was more to it, but that is the main part. I feel like that kid - alot. More than I should.  I figured out how I feel here in this town.  I feel like the Clark Kent/ Whipping Boy. Basically, overall I'm a good person... I do my own thing, work on my own stuff. However, when something bad goes wrong, I either go into Superman mode (mainly counseling) or Whipping Boy mode (taking the fall). I always seem to get the negative end. I'm rather ready for someone to stand and say "Chillout", Liz is cool - she's done nothing.  I'm tired. I'm stressed. On top of that I'm moving (somewhere) and I know that I'm about to be separated from many of my friends. I really can not deal with any more problems. My house is a mess and I have finals. My family is breathing down my neck about school and finding a job. My phone has been ringing off the hook with problems that must be solved or at least controlled. Friends are betraying friends, people are being hurt. All I want is for individuals to stop hurting "friends". Its stupid. Its painful. The wounds can last a very long time.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I heard something interesting today. CNN proclaimed  "2004: The Year of the Blog" . No kidding. When I started at the new year, I had a website,  Debbie  had a website, and  Rick  had one. Now I have over 30 friends that maintain them. Some are better than others when it comes to keeping them updated. Debbie is probably the best. I won't head in the other direction. I enjoy reading these websites.  Scott  said "I've gotten to know a new side of you" (or something along those lines). That has been my goal. I feel that I open up through writing. It is fairly hard for me to open up vocally. I wish I could, but it rarely happens.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I'm rather bummed out about the Foreign Service. I know that I was more than ready for a response, but the response was not what I wanted. It was just one more thing in the many that happened this week. I had worked so hard for it. I studied so much, read so much, I even watched TV specials on places like Tibet. Thing is, I enjoy that so much. To me, an thourough understanding of International Studies and Cultures give so much insight into life. When I think things can't get worse, I just open up one of my world conflict books. It is at that point I feel like I have no room to complain.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Things Never Said by VSU students   10. Oh I just couldn't. Hell, she's only a freshman. 9.  I'll take Shakespeare for 1000, Alex. 8.  Sorry - I can't go to Remerton, I have to study. 7.  Palms is awesome. 6.  I love my 8am Class. 5.  I just couldn't find a thing at Walmart today. 4.  Orchestra weekends are the best! 3.  Checkmate. 2.  I don't have a favorite drink. 1.  Nope, no more for me. I'm drivin' tonight.

       So, I was beginning to feel all good about graduating from a university, when I find the following news article online:   Valdosta State University's Web site lists an assistant professor of management as "Dr. Jack Malehorn."  What the Web site doesn't say, and what students and colleagues probably don't know, is that Mr. Malehorn's Ph.D. is from Shelbourne University.  Shelbourne does not exist. It never existed. It claimed to be based in Ireland, but actually was one of more than a dozen names used by an international diploma-mill company that sold degrees, beginning in the mid-1990s, for $500 to $2,500, according to an investigation last year by the Federal Trade Commission. The company, based in Romania, sent millions of unsolicited e-mail messages around the world, promising recipients that they could receive degrees without doing any academic work. Along with the diplomas, the company also provided fake transcripts and phony letters of recommendation.  When contacted by The Chronicle, Mr. Malehorn at first denies that his Ph.D. is from Shelbourne, even though his room says it is. "No, no, I'm sorry," he says. "I wish I could help you."  After further inquiries, Mr. Malehorn acknowledges that his doctorate is, in fact, from Shelbourne. He also contends that he did actual academic work to obtain it. "It was all through an Internet connection," he says. "My dissertation certainly seemed legitimate." His boss doesn't think so. Kenneth L. Stanley, dean of the College of Business Administration, says he knew before hiring Mr. Malehorn that he had a fake Ph.D. "Hell, we knew it was worthless," says Mr. Stanley. "Give us a break!"  But he hired Mr. Malehorn anyway because, according to the dean, it's not uncommon for professors, or even top administrators, to have bogus credentials. "I've dealt with provosts with degrees from mail-order institutions here in the United States," Mr. Stanley says. (He declines to name any of those provosts or their institutions.)  What's important, he argues, is that Valdosta State does not recognize the degree, nor was it a factor in the decision to hire Mr. Malehorn. "If Jack had come here and we had hired him thinking, 'Oh, well, he's doctorally qualified,' and we're claiming that qualification, then we're idiots and he's wrong," says Mr. Stanley.  Contrary to the dean's insistence, however, it appears that Valdosta State does consider the degree valid. Why else would the professor be referred to as "Dr." in the bulletin that announced his hiring in 2002? Why else would he be listed as "Dr." in the university's telephone directory and on the management department's Web site? And why else would he be allowed to call himself "Dr. Jack Malehorn, Ph.D." when he contributes articles to the Journal of Business Forecasting?  When all that is brought to Mr. Stanley's attention, he is quiet for several seconds. "It's a little embarrassing," he admits. He recalls referring to Mr. Malehorn as "Dr." on several occasions, including in front of students. "I guess, you know, we're guilty of institutionalizing a fraud," says Mr. Stanley.  The dean pledges that references to Mr. Malehorn's Ph.D. will be deleted from official university material. Six weeks later, the management department's Web page still calls him "Dr."   Fortunately, I just checked the website, it has now been changed. But he is still on faculty.    And just in case you didn’t feel bad enough about being in south Georgia:  In September, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution profiled desolate Echols County, Georgia (between Valdosta and the Okeefenokee Swamp), well-known to the state's judges because that is where they encourage lawbreakers to go when they really want them to leave the state altogether. The Georgia constitution prohibits banishing people from the state as punishment for crimes, so judges merely banish them from 158 of the state's 159 counties, trusting that they would never voluntarily settle in Echols, anyway, and such strategy seems always to work. [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 9-30-01]    All that happened today  was that I fell and busted my knee. Damn. Sometimes I wish we could just start a week over, and try it again.

      Dear Elizabeth Anne Chewning,  We want to thank you for taking the Foreign Service Written Examination on April 24, 2004.   Regretfully, your score on the written examination was not high enough for you to proceed to the next phase of the foreign service. We do encourage you to try again. Many successful Foreign Service Officers have taken the Written Examination several times.  We urge you to maintain your interest in Foreign Affairs and in pursuing a career with the Department of State.   Sincerely,  The Board of Examiners  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  There we go. I guess that's it for this year. I'll try again next year. I love taking extensive 7hr exams.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  At least I've now heard. I can now accept whatever comes my way. Still, lately I've been freaking out over graduation. I'm not freaking out in a bad way, but rather, an "Oh My God I actually am graduating and I must find a job" way. It usually results in my heart racing and a blank stare for a while into the vastness of the computer or TV screen.   I bought the robe and tassle today for the ceremony. Yayness.

      A few things you should never do during a road trip:  1. Leave the milk out.  2. Leave *any* food out.  3. Leave the cat out when the above has happened.  We all live and learn. Oh well. I had a lovely trip to see Scott. The drive down there was frightful due to some extreme weather in North Florida, and the drive back was interesting in that I had to stop on the interstate for a helicopter. Now that said, I know I can't just leave it at that. Simply, I was cruising rather quickly on I75N and I notice a low flying chopper. Well, knowing that FL has a history of issuing tickets from the air, I slowed it down a bit. When its search/landing lights came on, I thought.. uh... what's goin' on? Then, rounding a curve, yeah... it decides to land right in front of me. That was a first.  It was great to see Scott, and we got to hang out the whole weekend. I kicked off my visit w/ a round of some sort of virus/food poisoning.. something. Anyway, the rest of the trip was me trying to find my voice in order to talk to Scott. He was a good sport about it all.   Did I mention that Florida is cool? Well, it is!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I found the following on a website (www.thegoosenest.com). I pulled what I felt was the best.   From the  100 Things You Shouldn't Do in Valdosta    1.Reminisce about the Good Ol' Days when Hugh Bailey was President of Valdosta State University.   2.Circle repeatedly around the VSU campus in your late-model sports car while playing really loud rap music and carrying several ounces of marijuana in your glove compartment.  3.Expect to make a living wage at Valdosta State University  4.Expect anything intelligent in the VD Times Rant and Rave  5.Say that academics is more important than football  6.Call VSU “Valdosta College”  7.Try to get anywhere on time if driving on Bemiss Road.  8.Drive through Remerton too fast, too slow, or too close to the center line.  9.Try to turn left onto Gornto from the Baytree Bank of America parking lot  10.Spit off the Sky Walk at VSU  11.Transport drugs on I-75 and drive real fast  12.Being late and expecting not to catch the damned old train on Baytree   13.Being early and not expecting to catch the damned old train on Baytree   14.Let go of your shopping cart in the Publix parking lot." It will roll 'til it hits 30 mph or a person, whichever comes first!  15.Drive to Lake City for beer on Sunday and speed back to Valdosta with no headlights on.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Whoa, the server has changed once again.. It looks like now I don't even have to type in the html code.. YAY. &nbsp; I now have the capicity to upload pictures, so you guys will be able to "see" me wherever I end up. I'm rather excited. &nbsp; Speaking of "ending up", I will be in Florida tonight! (I promised a cheerful entry didn't I?) I'm going down there to see Scott for a bit. Other than that, I really don't have too much to update on. I've pretty much been chilling out at my apt. with the cat.&nbsp; Roadtrips are always an adventure, so... I'll let you know all about it later! &nbsp; &nbsp;

      "I'll call you tomorrow".  I hear it all the time, but rarely does it happen. I know that I'm as guilty as the next person, but I do try call if I promise, and if I don't, I usually call later with an apology.  It irritates me when "friends" don't do what they say they will. I understand that shit happens, but come on. This comes under my last rant of personal responibility.   On the other hand, I do have friends that go above and beyond the call of duty. They know who they are.  Miranda  really came through me this week. I was rather upset at a friend one evening, and she and I got to talking about it, and she invited me over to talk about it - at 4 in the morning. Now that is a friend. Thanks girl!  Another friend who has been there for me this week is  Scott . He has hooked me up not only with a job interview, but also a place to live given the opportunity to live in south Florida. He and I have become much better friends over the years. I'm glad he's my friend.  Times of trouble prove who your friends are. Sometimes they come out of the woodwork, sometimes you are extremely surprised at who they really are. While I can't say that I would be there for   everyone   that I know, but I would be there for those I care for. The people you party with and the people that are true friends are very rarely the same crowd - or at least it is in my experience.   I once asked  Jon  (before I dated  Davis ) "Do you think its strange that I'm 23 years old and I've never had a relationship that lasted longer than a month?" He looked up at me, looking me in the eyes, and with a serious tone he replied, "No, I don't think its strange. You're smart and you know that we [boys] are all worthless."  I have been rather amazed at what boys will say and do to girls to get what they want. I've heard that they are wired differently, and I am really beginning to believe it. I know guys who say "I don't mean to hurt you" or "I don't want to hurt you", yet, they still do. They do things that can only hurt people. Not only does it hurt the girl that they do it to, but also their own friends. Sometimes the scope of pain that is caused by one person is much further reaching than an individual can possibly imagine. It pains me to know that someone that says that he cares for me would do things that hurt. I'm not only referring to myself and my friendships with fellows, but also my sisters and other girlfriends and their relationships with boys.    When there is smoke, there is usually a fire.     post script I know not all guys out there are bad - as a matter of fact many of you are wonderful. This entry was just inspired by 3 guys from this week that annoyed me for one thing or another.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  On a happy note, I had a job interview with  Disney  yesterday for a six-month job in corporate skills training. Basically, it works like this. You work basic corporate jobs, they give you a place to live, and you learn how the corporation works. At the end of the six months, you can stay on if you liked it. I'm rather excited about this job. I had a good laugh with  Mom today. I said, "So when I'm asked what I'm doing after graduation, I'm saying 'I'm going to Disney World'". Hah.  I have a job interview on Friday with  Edward Jones Investments  in Ft. Myers. Wish me luck!  I have yet to hear from the foreign service, and its getting really annoying now... I NEED TO KNOW. Ugh.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I finally got some allergy medication, and now for the first time in about a week I can sit at my computer, with my cat of course, and not feel like I want to die. Yay.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The other night, while talking to  Rick  on the phone, I broke into tears about my leaving Valdosta. That was a first. Usually I cried because I couldn't leave Valdosta. Its not that I'm not ready to leave, I am. Its that I do have some great connections here. Starting in a week and a half, I'm going to start my official goodbyes here in Valdosta. Scott did that when he left, and it actually meant alot to me, even though we keep in touch. So, taking my experience, I'm going to do the same.

      Its early, and I find myself in the library, exhausted and stressed. My final VSU presentation is in a while, and my group is nowhere to be seen. I swore they said "9am" but, alas, I bet it was 9:30.  I ask myself what should I write about. I could write about the party at A1 and being able to play with AJ's snake Percy, or I could write about another party that got completely out of hand - one that I left early.   Taking the latter, I feel that personal responsibility has died. I'm not referring to an single individual, but rather all of us. Every single person could stand up and say, "stop it" or "guys, you need to chill". But oh no, personal responsibility is no more. No one can take a stand and do what they need to, me included. I look back at the five years, and I wonder what would have been different if I had maintained my position, morals, whatever you want to call it. I could rattle on about this, but you know me, and there is no need to open up the old mistakes of another era. But what we do need to do is to take a stand when we fail, and take responsibility for our mistakes. On the greater scale, just look at our national leadership. There are alot of folks there that should answer for their errors, but they don't. Oh well.   I have seen some miraculous things in the past. I have seen two acquaintances in high school bear a child, take responsibility for their actions, and they now have successful lives, and the child is fine. I have seen people admit to academic dishonesty, and I have seen folks not admit to it, which resulted in punishment, and near expulsion of the entire class. That sucked.    All I say about this is that to be a good person, should we take personal responsibilty? I say yes. When we don't we not only hurt ourselves but others around us, and sometimes even those we love.  In regards to the party, I took responsibility for myself, but not for the others there. I failed them. But I also realize that sometimes I just can not change the world; I can't change what everyone else thinks and does. For once, I did what was best for me.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I called home Saturday to talk to Mom about my "post graduation" plans. She of course, wants me to move to Griffin and work for the clinic, or to work for one of our friend's clinics. I don't think so. I think that would be murder to me. I told her if I were to do that, I would make her sign a contract that stated the basic "freedoms" of a college person. The right to maintain my own hours, to come and go as I please, and of course, not explain where I am, who I'm with etc.   She wasn't too thrilled at the idea, which didn't surprise me. She said, oh, that's not necessary. Bingo mom - yes it is. As soon as she said that I knew that nothing had changed since I was 17 and living at home for the last time. Forget the fact I've traveled Europe 4 summers, forget the fact that I have been in college, I'm still a helpless 17 year old. Ugh. I told her in response:  Have I ever been arrested? Have I ever called for bail? Have I ever been to the ermergency room? Have I ever called home pregnant?  No.  It got her attention, finally. Dad later sent me an email saying, call me at work, we'll talk without mom. Its not going behind her back, its talking to someone who knows how I feel.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I had dinner with  April  last night, and that was most pleasurable. I don't see her often but when I do its always very nice. We talked about my military offer (oh yeah, I didn't mention that did I?). Basically, I aced the exams and the Army said, "Intelligence Officer". It came to me as a complete surprise. Just something else to add to the complications.  Thats it for this morning, but I'm betting there wil more later.

      I don't feel like writing.  My sister  "MC"  came down for the weekend and we took off to Orlando on Friday afternoon. Because of traffic and weather issues, it took us 5 hrs to get there. We met up with her friends from college  Jason  and  Ryan . Jason lives there, so he was the host. He had alot of things planned for us to do... including going to Walt Disney's Pleasure Island club. So, after dinner we did some shopping and exploring, and then we headed over to the club.  We got our tickets w/ no problem, and then proceeded to 8Trak (80s music). When they saw my ID, they said "this looks like a fake because there is a ripple in the hologram." So, we batted our eyes in disbelief, and went to a number of the other clubs... and none of them blinked at the ripple that has been on my ID since it was made.   After a few hours, we decided to go back to 8Trak. MC, Ryan, and Jason are all 80s fanatics, so they really wanted to dance there. Not to mention Ryan is a VIP there and goes ALOT!.  Well, being that I had bracelets on from the other clubs, the new door bouncer let us all in. About 15 minutes later, while doing the electric on the floor w/ the others, I get tapped on the shoulder. Its a Rent-a-Cop for W.D. World.  He said, "I have been told to look at your ID".  Shit.  Here is a "screen play" of what happened.      Me:  Sure, here it is.   WDW Cop:  Okay... the manager said one of the bouncers said you tried to get in earlier and that this was a fake. The manager has the final word, so she needs to see you.   MC:  Sir, I'm a police officer w/ FCPD in Rome Ga badge #[xxxxx]. Here is my ID and I verify that this is a legal state of GA ID.   WDW Cop:  Okay, thank you. But please come with me, the manager needs to see you.         move to front door of club, met by 5 city of Orlando officers   Manager (with original bouncer):  There is a ripple in the hologram of your ID. If you can show us any other form of picture ID such as military or a passport, with your age on it, then we will let you in.   Me:  Well, being that I'm not military and I didn’t have to cross any international borders to get here, I have neither.    Manager:  Do you have an ATM card?   Me:  I have two credit cards. What does that prove?   Manager:  Never mind. I'm sorry, but we cannot let you in.    MC:  Call it in and run a check via (insert fancy acronym here). I am a police officer (shows badge and police photo ID) and I do verify this person is my sister, she is 23, and she was born in 1981. We can wait for you to do a validity check on this ID.   Orlando Cop:  I'm sorry about this.   Orlando Cop 2:  We believe you, but it is ultimately up to the manager.   Me:  Look, I'm not drinking, and I don't care about drinking. If its okay, I will be fine with just being allowed in to hang out with my friends that we traveled to visit. I know that the rule is 18 to party, 21 to drink. I'm fine with just being allowed to party.   Manager:  I'm sorry, but no. You can leave on your own, or you can be escorted. I will have to ask you for your club bracelets.   Me:  Take me into custody and run a check on me.    MC:  This is unbelievable. (Rips off her bracelet)   Ryan:  Let's just go... we will no longer support PI.      Pleasure Island Staff Sucks    I had the opportunity to see four movies this week. The first one I was  Man on Fire . I went to that one with Miranda. I saw were  Spiderman 2  and  Garfield . I enjoyed all three.   The final movie I saw was " King Arthur ". To everyone out there, you must see this movie on the big screen. It was incredible!!!!  ~~~~~~~~~~  I am on an evolutionary track right now... I about to leave college. In Valdosta I was busy... but this past semester was very different... I was quite reclusive once I got home. Even though I write alot about my friends and about other people that live here and that I interact with, I know that they won't keep in touch with me - for the most part. As much as I say I want to get out of Valdosta, I know what it means..... it means what it does for every graduate, a leaving behind of a social life that can't be easily replaced.   I must add that I'm crazy insane when it comes to keeping up with poeple, however, I select who i keep in-touch with very carefully. Over the last 4 years I have come into contact with some great people in other countries and through the european council, and I have managed to keep up with a few of them... even if its only a few times a year. I have seen so many times kids with notebooks that take the names and numbers/emails of the other students in academic programs (study abroad) and when I do follow up work, I find that they have kept in touch with only one, if that.  I recognize that in the next few months I will learn who my true friends really are, and it pains me to know that my "A List" will become even shorter in the years to come.  I can only hope that I have made a difference on those whose paths I have crossed and that when I do contact them, they will respond. However,  I also recognize reality .   It is my hope to everyone that reads this that you realize what I am saying, for it truely applies to all of us. We will never get to live again the days of the undergraduate marching band-camp parties, nor Greek fraterhood that so many of us hold dear... the best that we can do, and we must do our best, is to work at keeping up with each other. More than a Christmas card, we must call each other up on a random evening, and say, You are my friend. I did just this yesterday, I called up a friend that I had not talked to in a year, and I said Happy Birthday My Friend. Even though we have been separated by so much time and distance, it was so welcoming to know that we were still close. My lesson from college is this, our friends are the most dear assest we have other than our family. One day things may get rough for us, and we may need a friend. I hope that if that person is me I can call on you, and I hope that if that person is you that you feel that you can call on me. I have been called upon at all hours of the day and night by friends in need, and I have never left them hanging. I have called people that I have thought to be my friends, to find that they are "too busy right now". Evaluate your "A-List" now. Keeping in mind that you will find surprises around every corner, you will have to leave some friends behind.   Leaving friends behind because of something that happened is so tramatic. I think that most true humans (meaning those that have lived) have experienced that pain I mention. However, I think that life has so much more to offer, and that the old cliche "When one door closes, another opens" is very true.   If I have learned anything from my friends who have already left Valdosta, it is true friendship. It is knowing that there will be times when you get home from work and you will want to cry and then sleep. You will have to call upon someone who is feeling the same way, but if you work through it together you will survive. It is that we must keep in mind. We should not be expected to make it through this life alone. However, as much as I preach about friendship, I must mention evil. I know that there are many out there who would rather see me dead. They would like to see me ousted from their social circles so that they may be leader, or that I do not infringe on their space. To this I say "woop-de-fucking-do". Do not worry about them for they shall meet their own kind along the way.    So what I want to bequeth to you is this:  Do everything thing you can to keep your friends from college. You will be surprised how many you will lose immediately. True friends are far and few between - keep them when you get them. After five years of college I think I can say without a doubt, friends are what makes a person who they are. It is the fundamental building block of who we are. Go out into the world, help society, leave your mark - do whatever it is you want to do, but please, remember where you cam from.     Five years after coming to VSU as a kid saying "who am I, what am I doing here", I am a young adult. I have acquired a precious circle of friends. I am about to graduate having done things I thought I could never do. I hold positions within the university that I thought I never could. I have found the strength of my own voice and I have found a special place for Valdosta in my heart. I have learned to seize the opportunities and defeat the perils I face everyday, I must be more than an audience, more than the actor, I must be the author of my life and take control... In the fairy tale, it could end here.. In my life, it's merely the beginning of a new chapter - however, remember that in a book chapters build from the previous ones, and those characters from chapters 18 to 23 will influence every single chapter, from here to the end.    My friends, you all hold a dear place in my heart.

      A things to mention on this post - and hold on, its a long one!   1) Davis  and I have called it quits - as far as actually dating is concerned. He came over last night after closing (Locos), his last night in Valdosta, and we simply curled up on the couch for a while. Not much had to be said... we both knew. We actually fell asleep hand-in-hand... and for the first time I believe I loved and was loved in return.  I    2)  I was on  national radio  tonight! I called into the  Jim Bohannan Show  out of Washington DC and was put on the air live... Yay Me! The the topic was driver safety, and the reason I called in was because when I wrecked my car in March, I was on the cell phone... which was the primary topic of the show. Basically, we were debating whether or not cell phones were safe.   3) My brother  Richard   (Biology Major, Furman Univ.) is currently at Woods Hole, outside of Boston, doing scientific research on, well... little creatures from the Pacific ocean, and next week he ships off on a research vessel in Seattle to actually do site research. I'm really concerned about him... here is an example of some of his text messaging w/ me:     ~hate life right about now ~i am just too dman (sic) tired  Me: whatcha working on?  ~DVM and copepods ~ i have gotten only 9 hrrs the last three days    I really hope he will be okay... He has limited time, and he has to do well on this research project.   4)  I talked to a friend today that is currently a music teacher here in GA (VSU graduate). He just had a devastating break up with his girlfriend and he is having a hard time. I spent quiet a while on the phone with him today. Break ups are hard... I wish they didn't exist. I find that alot of what we have to deal with at college are directly related to them... maybe we should outlaw dating and go back to arranged marriages. JUST KIDDING!   5)  I got a phone call at about 3am the other night.. from a buddy of mine who is in the local chapter of a friendly fraternity on our esteemed campus. Basically the conversation went like this:   Him: Are you awake? Me: Yes Him: Are you sober? Me: Yes Him: I need your help. I need you to come get me right now. Me: Okay, no problem. Where are you? Him: Bill's Bayou. [which is nearly around the corner from me] Me: I'll be there. Let me put on decent clothes.  Him: Thank you.   So I get there and all I see is blue lights. He had been pulled over while DUI. The back up police officer was Derick, told him... Look, Liz lives around the corner, if you can get her here now I'll let you go. So there you have it... I rescued a friend. *smiles*    A very close issue to my heart:  I am very worried about a friend of mine (who shall remain nameless here... but I know you read this occasionally.  (I hope I don't offend you by putting this up.. if it does let me know and I'll remove it from the website.)  This is the away message that my friend is currently using:   Be still, my soul, as I lay here dying.  Reliquish control; the turning point has come.  Be still, my soul, with broken bones here lying.  Enrapture the Lord; the darker day is done, for the victory has been won.  Just a suicide away from home.  So I'm here waiting, afraid to make the move, drunk on wine and moonshine that floods into this room.  And I can't stop thinking of streets paved with gold.  The fingers laid on razor blade, I am coming home.    While the writing is fantastic, the underlying message to me is very scary. Please, if you need someone to help... please call. I'm here for you.   Regarding that debate about a woman as president...   Thank you Eziel for your comment/ question regarding what happened the other day in my conversation regarding presidents.   My points in the discussion were pretty simple to be quite honest. I pointed out that many successful women had held a variety of offices in Washington, as well as in other countries and I reminded him that India and Great Britain both have had female prime ministers. To this he said "yeah but they aren't American, and its only American women I'm concerned about here." Well, duh... only Americans can hold office right? Moving on... I also added that the Army now had a woman as a one-star general.. and I asked how he felt about that. He said that as long as she had no buttons (reference to Nukes) to push it was okay. I also tried to comment that it was very likely that Hillary would be nominated for president in 2008, and he said that every man and most woman would vote against her. I'm not so sure. Isn't about 52% of the nation female? Today on talk radio, and I am definitely going to tell him about this tomorrow, several Washington insiders belief that George W. will dump Cheney as VP, and nominate Condi, and add to that Kerry will select Hillary. Now, how cool would that be? I think both of these women are wonderful leaders and I know they are infinitely smarter than many guys I know. Many women are very patient and rational - and add to that most women that are high enough in government to even be considered for the VP or Prez office are age 50+, the whole hormone argument is invalid. My main comment to him was: I just hope that a man as arrogant about the abilities of women as you does not end up in any place of power.  Harsh I know.. but that is how I feel! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  *Sighs. I miss Davis alot. I wish a few of you had met him.*
