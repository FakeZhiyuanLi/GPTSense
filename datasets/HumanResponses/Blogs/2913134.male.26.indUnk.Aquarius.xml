      Well, just finished attending my dear university's annual political theory conference.  They are always set up as "Must Political Theory Be ______".  This year, the blank was filled with "Secular."  Before getting into it, I should mention that these are definitely meetings for theorists.  As my dear heart calls them, these are "naval-gazing conferences."  And we gaze very well, or at least very deeply, if poorly.  So, this year was on secularism.  Three guest speakers are brought in each year, to provide their input on the question.  Usually, they try and arrange this as a matter of one person saying "yes," another "no," and another somewhere in-between.  This year did not quite turn out that way.  Instead, the answers were, "yes, more-or-less," "yes," and "HELL YES."  So, needless to say, those of us who are not secular-minded (like myself, the reincarnation of an old-line Dominican; and then my good friend, the ardent Calvinist) were a bit on the defense this time about.  It was illuminating, but not really in a positive way.  Contemporary political theory has a problem - the academics assume that they can assume quite a bit away.  As even one prof pointed out, apparently at their home universities, they generally don't have to face questions from folks who are hard-core religious believers, especially from those who aren't a little to the Left of Ted Kennedy.  So, when all is said and done, we find out that political theory must be secular because religion depends on faith statements and revelation, things that not everyone (in a plural society) will agree with.  Fine, great, good.  But, then, these folks are very interested in equality, freedom, liberty, etc., etc.  So, you ask them, "What is the basis for these ideas?"  The answer - a moral intuition.  Yeah.  Now, I am not the best student on earth, but I wager I would remember the day in Normative Political Theory class when we covered the Vulcan mind-meld that allows us access to each other's moral intuitions.  But, somehow, while we can't all agree on faith matters (obviously), somehow we can agree on moral intuitions.  That we can't access.  And that no one agrees on.  The key difference, I guess, between divine intuition and moral intuition is the former uses the dread "G" name, while the other doesn't. (sigh)  Oh, well.  Off to the reception now, where we eat, drink, talk, drink, be merry, and drink.

      Bleem.  Perhaps you have not heard of the term.  It comes from Conan O'Brien's "In the Year 2000."  It refers to a new emotion, a "type of happy anger."  It sounds contradictory, and yet, I have experienced bleem myself.  Where?  Why, on the Internet, of course.  Bleem perfectly typifies the feeling you get delving into the yahoo message boards.  There are all types of idiocy on them, but these various fools have one thing in common - an uncritical self-confidence, or, in other words, an ego so large that planets are shifting their orbits.  One gets bleem from interacting with these types because 1.) they tick you off, and 2.) you derive great pleasure from showing any with eyes to see the sheer nit-wittery of your opponents.  Naturally, though, one must be cautious about partaking in bleem.  After all, how many of those fools on-line started out as bleem addicts, too?  That, and you can kill far too much time on trying to make your case, especially with some of the....unique argumentative rules used in these boards.  One even told me that, in his way of thinking, he does not require rationality even of his own thoughts.  Ooooooh, bleem, bleem everywhere!  This was all rather random.  Much more to talk about, but little time (grant deadlines staring me down, and I'm starting to flinch).  Bleem.  Bleem bleem bleem.

      Some old high school buddies of mine made a listserv for us all, and one of my friends shared a dream she had, asking if anyone wanted to take a crack at analyzing it.  So, I figure what the heck, I'll do my best impersonations of Freud[sex freak] and Jung[complex], and see what happens.  I am very pleased to say that another friend on the list, a grad student in social psychology, said my Jung was "right on."  Yes yes, if this whole political theory thing doesn't work out, I can always spend my life delving into minds and the collective unconscious.  A guy in the department a couple weeks back said I should be a psychologist - a nice thought, but after hearing that their suicide rate was rather high, I decided against.  All in all, though, I cannot do better than yet another friend on the list, our friend Mo, who summed it up best: "Everybody have fun tonight!  Everybody cite Jung tonight."

      Generally speaking, when folks think of my dear university, Texas A&M University, they consider it to be a rather conservative (if not hick redneck) sort of place.  As of late, we have had so much "diversity" propaganda shoved up our respective whazoos to make me question Aggieland's stereotype.  So low and behold, what should I see on the front page of our dear student newspaper, the Battalion?  We apparently had ourselves a bit of a rally Friday.  Furious that our malcontent commissioners would not follow the humble San Francisco tradition of magistrates breaking the law, about 50 people organized to protest outside the courthouse for same-sex marriage licenses in a rally called, I kid you not, "First comes love, then comes marriage."  Allow me a cynical, snobbish, cheap shot - can one really take seriously a protest that gets its name from a schoolyard rhyme?  What next?  An anti-hate speech rally called "I'm made of rubber, you're made of glue"?  A diversity protest called, "Red Rover, Red Rover"?  A frat boy grass-roots movement against puritanical fashions on women called "I see London, I see France"?  [my inner frat boy who never was cries out "sign me up!"  I hate that guy....he's the same one who leaves his dirty socks around my mind]  But, I guess time to get serious for a moment.  Considering that this is probably one of the most divisive social issues since the abortion controversy started, one would wish and hope, apparently in vain, for some serious defense of this radical change.  But no, the quotes leave much to be desired.  My personal favorite is from a student (a social science doctoral student, no less), saying that "We're presented with the question not of marriage, but of human rights.  We are here to celebrate the love of human beings."  How...sweet.  It's not a question about marriage - no doubt a shocker to the commissioners and to anyone hearing this rally's title.  No, it is about human rights.  Great, fine, swell.  What are human rights?  Where are they from?  Who decides?  In my admittedly limited experience, many who use the "human rights" claim in American political discourse generally mean "I have a political preference that can't be pushed through a legislature, so I want a judge to find it in the Constitution."  What a way to run rights.  But, perhaps I'm just too skeptical - perhaps there's some emanation from a penumbra that I'm missing.  And we're here to celebrate the love of human beings.  That's a relief (apparently Princeton's Prof. Singer wasn't invited - thank God for small favors).  Sounds good - I wager there may be some schismatic Mormons who will take up the fight.  After all, it's the love of human beings, even if it is the love of one man for 14 wives. [inner frat boy: "sign me up!".....that punk is the reason I still cringe every time I see Greek letters]  I have to admit, I love my brother.  Guess we should be swinging by the courthouse too.  But, then again, I wager this isn't the type of love my dear fellow student in the College of Graduate Studies had in mind.  What love is it then?  Unfortunately, "love" seems to increasingly mean (especially by judging some of the wonderful lunacy in the ivory tower of academia) the right to have sex with the carbon-based life-form(s) of choice (although perhaps silicon is next on the list).  When autonomy of self becomes the idol of a nation, decadence is truly well under way.

       THE JOYS OF TEACHING   I suspected at the beginning of this semester (this is my first teaching gig) that there would be a problem, and I was correct.  I spend the mid-part of the morning lecturing on early political thought (Plato to around Calvin).  And, thus far, 9:45 a.m. is just not the best part of the day to discuss political philosophy.  I shouldn't complain - heck, most my old high school friends, in that dread realm referred to as the "Reel Wurlt" (I run so quickly upon it being pronounced, I don't know what it exactly means), have honest jobs with honest hours....I would add honest pay, but they sound about as ramen noodle dependent as me.  But, all the same, philosophy is a bit different.  You read some of the old dialogues, and there you find Socrates and some of the guys just finishing a meal, taking it easy, having some wine, when someone suggests chit-chatting about justice, or virtue, or the beautiful, and thus it's all very....leisurely.  But, in the mornings, the "meal" (if there was one) was probably inhaled on the way to West Campus, alcohol isn't allowed on university grounds ( angst ), and even if it was permitted, it would put us all to sleep.  Truly, philosophy and mornings only mix well for the holy, monastic, or masochistic.

       WELCOME ALL   Having seen a few other folks do this, I figured I should stop my Luddite ways and join in the blogosphere.  While generally the topics talked about here will involve political, theological, and philosohpical commentary on my part (yes, I can see you are all thrilled), I wager I'll be writing about whatever comes to mind.  Should be fun.  For me, anyway.  So, let us commence.

      While there are many thinks to chat about, I did want to get to this - the curious case of the IHOP conspiratorialist.  Some background - my sleeping patterns suck.  Sometimes, I will wake up really late on a weekend, and my only hope of normalizing my schedule is be spending all night awake.  This happened the past Sunday into Monday, and early in the morning I decided to hit IHOP for some coffee.  I was planning on just reading some  De Trinitate , but a group of undergrads next to me was deeply involved in political conversation (which perked up my ears).  I could also tell their politics were a weeeee bit different than mine (I was glad to be informed that all Republicans are racist sexists....all this time, I didn't realize I was a mysoginist racialist.  Who knew?).  They got on the topic of gay marriage, and I found myself getting involved.  Soon after, a rather rude associate of theirs came up.  That's when things got interesting.  I was mostly speaking to a fellow named Mark, a rather intelligent-seeming fellow, atheist, liberal, and aspiring musician.  Later on in the evening, we got into a wonderful chat about mind-body dualism.  But the main fellow was a Jordanian (the rude guy), apparently a student (couldn't tell if grad or undergrad) in one of the sciences (I believe).  He was more than willing to tell me "the truth" about the world, as Americans are apparently terribly uninformed.  I should have known - after all, Jordan is so well-known for its freedom of dissent and open political system....oh, wait.  You remember those scenes of some happy Iraqis, when the US troops came in?  Turns out, they weren't Iraqis - just Moroccans shipped in by the US for PR purposes.  Also, apparently for Arabs, the Saddam system was good.  I asked whether any system that involves random execution and wives being raped would be prefered by anyone, in which case he said the Arabs are different.  Whether the Shites would agree they are  that  different, I wonder.  Then said that all those horror stories were made up AND are actually being perpetrated on the ground by the US right now.  It gets better.  Naturally, of course, this comes back to oil, and to Zionism.  To oil - he gave the usual rendition of the Iraq-war-was-for-Cheney's-oil-buddies argument, which has always confused me.  We are talking about a dreadfully Machiavellian plot, filled with intrigue to satisfy the most base urges.  As doing something like that would be impeachable (if not executable as treason), one would think that it should be under wraps.  Instead, everyone from Senator Kennedy to all raving lunatics with an IP addresses have caught the kabbal red-handed.  You would think the CEOs would plan this better.  But then, there's Zionism, the dread Jewish plot.  Apparently, Israel has the US "by the balls," in the phrase of the Jordanian.  Never did find out how (perhaps the Jews have just entrenched themselves in the government, you know, when they're not busy poisoning wells or sacrificing children and all that).  But, it is for the best, as apparently the US has unprecedented control of the world - I was told that we could order India to march through China (with the ChiComs' consent) to take out North Korea.  Or, just fake another 9/11, this time in China, to get them to see the light.  Why do I present all this?  Because this guy didn't seem like your typical anti-Semite conspiracy theory nut, as the stereotype goes.  He was educated.  He was well-traveled.  And yet, he spoke like someone who wears tinfoil on his head to keep the government from reading his mind.  And, if in some regions of the world, the educated talk like this, what about the uneducated?  I read today that apparently, a few years back,  Mein Kampf  made #6 for best-sellers in Palestine.  God help us if that demonic text is coming back into fashion, and if that is part and parcel of educated discourse over there.  I doesn't have to be that way.  Perhaps some regions would be better served reading the peaeceful works of someone like Gulen (a Turkish Muslim who really has pushed for the idea of "Islam = Peace").  We can hope they will.  But, after the Jordanian left, I asked Mark if I had guessed right, and that our mutual chatting partner was a conspiratorialist.  He said yes, but that he tended to see conspiracies around as well.  Perhaps conspiracies serve for the educated what superstition served for the uneducated centuries ago - bringing order to chaos, no matter how ridiculous it sounds.

      to cancel a lecture, this has to be my favorite.  Reported on the department email yesterday (when some nasty storms were crossing Texas): "Due to tornados in Dallas, {the guest speaker's}’s flight today and talk for tomorrow at noon have been cancelled."  Talk called of on account of tornado.  Gotta love it.

      Students are not fond of exams (adendum - students not hopped up on mind-altering drugs are not fond of them).  And yet, I wager that the teachers and professors may dread them even more.  Today, I gave my first exam of my career.  As I look back at my bookcase, where they are all arranged, I feel that subtle, quiet part of my mind saying, "HOLY FREAKIN' JEEZ!!!!!!!!!!!  WHAT THE ^$#&%$#@&$ AM I TO DO WITH THESE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"  Allow me to explain the  fear .  The  fear  is a matter of being professional, of being merciful, and of being justice.  Professionally, I have never done this before - heck if I know how to grade one of these, much less a class full of them.  Mercifully, I remember how much I dreaded exams, and (for the first years) how important the grades can be.  But also justice, since it is no fair for some to work hard, and get the same grades as Gomer-the-mouth-breather.  As I see them, they taunt me, these exams.  They taunt me with failure.  First, I worry of my own failure, "Perhaps I didn't teach them enough....perhaps I gave too hard of questions...perhaps I'm not cut out for this."  Then comes their failure: "I gave these kids all the breaks....I made  really really  clear what they needed to know....they answer like this?  How the hell did they get into college?"  And so, the fluctuations continue.  And still the exams taunt me.  They say, "Grade us....come on, tough guy....grade us....show these students what a hardass jerk you are....grade us....show them what a creampuff spineless wonder you are....grade us....stop sniffing glue before blogging....grade us...."  Oh, well.  The joys of teaching, I guess.  But, if nothing else, I can rely on my good  magister , St. Augustine, to offer some good reading with  De Trinitate  and  De Civitate Dei  (I highly suggest them both)(stop laughing).  Now I am off to run.  Soon, oh so soon, I will discuss its horrors.  But, before that, I will tell you of the curious case of the IHOP conspiratorialist.  Stay tuned, true believers.

      Reception was well.  As one friend of mine used to say, "the wine flowed like....well, wine."  Conversation, as always, was a bit odd.  I think a group of us spent about twenty minutes in debate regarding which James Bond films were the best (it started over an argument about Sean Connery vs. Roger Moore).  But one thing was clear - best Bond girl?  Diana Rigg - Bond's wife in the tragically-ended "On Her Majesty's Secret Service."  Also, the guy who played Bond in that one (his only time in the role) had the best turn-and-fire at the film's beginning (you know, where you see Bond through the rifling and such): apparently, he has the best footing for opening fire.  A shame the rest of the movie is so comparatively dry (they even had a good villian - who wants to face off with Kojak?).  Aren't you glad that academics discuss such deep and meaningful topics?  After that, the grad students and profs ended up talking amongst their respective groups.  We students ended up talking about theology, religion, the Bible, and Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ."  Beats me what the professors were chatting about.  When one of us went to get another drink, a prof asked her if we were still talking about Bond and such.  She said we were talking about the Bible.  His response: "You mean, like the Scriptures and stuff?"  She asked if he'd like to join in....turned it down.  Ah, the difference in generations.  More to come - you too will learn the horrors of running.

      ....the specter of Ludditism.  And we will win.  At times, I regret being a Luddite - technology can be quite nice and all that.  But then, there are two things that bring me to rage.  These are car alarms and cell phones.  To destroy these banes to our existence, revolution is justified.  Car alarms are to prevent robbery.  Perhaps they do.  On the other hand, if you hear such an alarm what do you think first?  "Oh, someone's car is getting jacked!  Call the cops!" or "Dammit, that thing's going off again?  Boy, get me my shotgun!  I'll give it somethin' to yell about!"  Perhaps if they only went off now and again, it would be okay.  But no.  Near my cell/apartment, there is this one alarm, connected to some SUV Mommy and Daddy apparently gave an undergrad, that goes off every bloody night.  At around 2:00 a.m.  Every night.  I am not a big sports guy, but after about a week of this, I was half-tempted to invest in a metal baseball bat.  But alarms are nothing compared to that greater curse, the cell phone.  Why is it called "cell phone"?  Oh, sure, they try and give you that fancy technojargon as to why, but I'll tell you why!  It's because the phone imprisons you.  It is a jail that fits in the palm of your hand.  That's why!  (go ahead - ask me who killed JFK.  I'm quite in the know about all these things)  Yes, cell phones can be quite helpful if, say, you are stranded in the middle of nowhere, Texas, and need a tow truck.  But, then again, maybe not.  I've seen  Red Dawn , I know how to survive in the wilderness (you just have to attack passing Soviet/Cuban convoys).  So, as I was saying, sooner or later someone will come across your sun-bleached bones and give you a proper burial.  What more do you need?  But now, now it seems that everybody and his/her cousin have these bloody things, and talk on them all the time.  What, is a couple moments of silence that dreadful?  Do you really have anything that interesting to say 24/7?  (if so, give CNN a call - they need you desperately)  But most of all, is there anything of such bloody importance that you have to chit-chat going 85 MPH down the highway?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  Two friends of mine in the department (of West Virginian origin) had an idea for solving this.  They volunteered to "remove" the traffic danger from car-cell-talkers with the aid of a high-powered rifle.  All they asked in return was that for every ten "attaboys," they were allowed one "oops."  I think that is acceptable.  Car alarms and cell phones - the Gog and Magog of technological monstrosity.  They must be destroyed!!!  And as such, when the revolution comes, the yuppies and the preppies will be the first to die.  LUDDITES OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      So don't say you weren't warned.  Basically, figured I'd get this out of my system now, before moving on to other things.  First, the joys of academic politics.  Give a quick glance at the following article (http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110004806) (yes, you will have to cut and paste, because I am a luddite....more on that later) from John Miller.  At least within the realm of political science (and even moreso in some of the humanities fields), those of us somewhat to the right ("Whataya mean 'somewhat,' Franco?" says the disembodied soul of Che Guiverra) do tend to find our professions to be somewhat alien realms.  It makes conferences fun: saying "I supported the Iraq War" somehow changes in the air, so when your fellow professional hears it, the words are "I sacrifice cute little kittens to the demonic forces of Lucifer-and-Cheney."  The "otherness" of it is bizarre, but keeps things interesting.  One other bit of venom on politics, that came to mind during one of my last bleem-hunts on yahoo some time ago.  On the various issues discussed, they had a pretty strong view of what was right.  And therefore, it was Constitutional.  Apparently, the mystical magical constitution promises all good things, so whatever one thinks is "right" must be a Constitutional right.  This never ceases to amaze me.  If this is true, obviously we don't talk about the Constitution's origins correctly - you get the idea that it was a bunch of fellows conferencing with one other for stability's sake.  But, no, rather, it should be thus: "And lo, down from the heights of clouded Mount Vernon came Madison, carrying upon his arms the two tablets, one called 'Constitution' and the other 'Bill of Rights.'  And Madison said to the people, 'Verily I say unto you, the Autonomy thy Self has written these tablets, and through these tablets all blessings be upon you.'  And the people rejoiced, and there was much cheering."  The Constitution is not Sacred Scripture.  It is not the Bible, the Torah, the Koran....heck, it's not even the Rights of Man.  It is a social compact with disparate influences.  Not every good thing is covered.  Not every bad thing is covered either.  Something could be wonderful, and not protected.  Something could be dreadful, and not unconstitutional.  Hopefully, if the Constitution can be desacralized at some point, discussion about "Constitutional" and "Unconstitutional" can be more reasonable.  (Whew).  Okay, I feel better now.  On to other things.

      Just a couple notes for the dear readership on things to come, random statemtents, etc.  First, I have received some nice feedback, which I greatly appreciate.  One in particular has been most helpful, from "the Dude" (for the Dude abides).  He made mention that the style here is quite a bit like that of NRO's Jonah Goldberg (cut and paste the following: http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg-archive.asp).  I take that as a high compliment - I will take credit for odd digressions, but I was inspired by that author's conversations with his couch and his dog to do the same.  But that's why this blog is superior - he has a cast of hundreds around him.  I have a cast of thousands - and those are just the ones residing in my head (good for blogging, bad for my psychotherapy bills).  I must admit being a bit new to this whole thing, so the linking/links/etc. are taking a little while (my dear heart will be helping me out with that soon, and she'll be among the first I link to)(or, take a look now: it's the Irish-Aggie News, through the blogger group).  But soon, oh so soon, this will look respectable.  As to the name.  I have to admit, I wanted the blog website to share the name of my old high school column, Shades of Gray.  Unfortunately, most renditions of "ShadesofGray" were taken (curses!).  So, "umbrae canarum" is my (admittedly poor) translation of the term into Latin.  I'll see if something more reasonable can be done later.  Now, a random thought.  It will help once I get "Comments?" for these posts to get your feedback (all three of you).  While I am quite happy to blather on constantly, the Dude's response gave me a thought (I know, a rare thing for me, but leave it to the side).  I may try and start up a group blog of some type, where the wonderful multiplicity of views can come forth.  Or, if nothing else, you can directly say, "Well, that last blog of yours was complete b*******, you ^$*^#^$#$(&^)&)(*%(&$^$#@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  That has been "program notes" for today.  We now continue with our regular broadcasts.

      Or, "The misanthrope speaks."  I wager I am just becoming a cranky old man [" becoming  one?" says my too-hip-to-exist other self][I call him Rick James for short].  The styles these kids wear these days!  So, there I am, sitting at a favored coffee place in dear Aggieland with a buddy of mine.  Who would have thought you would see so much flesh in one, supposedly conservative, place?  Low-rider jeans.  These just are wrong, as a matter of modesty and often aesthetics.  Why the exposed hip-bone?  Did I miss that stanza in  Romeo and Juliet ? "My sweet Juliet, My life for your sake! Face like the sun and  A pelvis to make men quake!"  And it does not help for modesty.  There is really no diplomatic way to tell a young woman that her crayon-orange thong is exposed for all the world to see.  In retrospect, I should have asked my buddy to give it a shot - at worst, he'd get smacked (but he's a  mensch , he can take it), and at best....I don't know, maybe get a compliment and phone-number out of the deal.  But then there is aesthetics.  There are many folks who wear these who  really really  shouldn't.  It has been mentioned, and I must concur, that the female form, by its nature, is a work of art.  It is a rare thing for a woman not to have some element of beauty (physical, emotional, mental, etc.), and the really lucky of us are involved with women who have many (the full title for my dear heart is: "dear-heart-of-exceptional-mind-great-virtue-and-looks-of-Venus")(take my word for it: in some languages, that is just one word).  But while all this is so, not every element always best reflects this art.  The pelvic bone is among them.  The odd inner-tube that forms, I'm sorry, does not make one think of Botecelli, nor Barry White tunes.  On the other extreme, where there is just...well, nothing, thanks to utter starvation.  Whatever lunatic pedophile fooled the fashion industry into thinking that women looking like 12-year-old boys is sexy should get a good six hours of "da business" from Eating-Disorders Anonymous.  But, more importantly, I write this to stop a slippery slope.  Alas, it has already begun.  For various reasons, these low-riders are bad enough on women.....now, I have seen them on men.  Imagine, if you will, walking into a store, and thereupon comes an Adonis-wannabe.  And his exposed midriff.  I don't think any of us wanted to see that.  And yet, it is there.  It won't go away.  You are tempted to just wedgie the guy and say "Get a hold of yourself, man!" but you can't.  Because he is 6'7'' and benchpresses Toyotas for warm-up.  So, you suffer....  the horror..... the horror....

      There's this group at Notre Dame [current dwelling place of my dear heart] called the Erasmus Institute, and they offer money/fellowships/etc. to random scholars who study somewhat more obscure topics.  Last year, and this year, I tried for their residential fellowships at ND (for the library, more importantly to be around said dear heart), but the *^$#&$#&$#&$#&$ refused both times.  [" oooooh, but I will have my revenge.....when they least expect it, I will stalk them down, and......huh.....not sure what I'd do next " says the horribly indecisive psychopath in my mind]  But today, I did get some good news from them.  They have seminars in Portland in the NW during the summers, and I will be headed there this summer for to study ethics and international relations.  Shut up - I find it interesting.  As another bit of good news, I gave my students back their exams today, and thus far I have not 1.) been struck with any bricks 2.) chased by an angry, pitchfork-waving mob 3.) found a dead cat stapled to my door  It's the little things you're thankful for.  But then again, it has only been a few hours....

      I must admit to being a bit out of sorts today.  All-nighters can do that.  Al-nighters dealing with grading can especially do that.  All-nighters dealing with grading at the start of the week before Spring Break when the students don't give a flying fungus about class can do that cubed.  Today, we started on Cicero's  De Re Publica  [Concerning the Republic].  My students were absolutely thrilled [yeah].  I was sleep-deprived.  That is a bad combination.  The problem with this week is the students seem to be under some false idea that Spring Break starting next week means teaching stops now.  So, while watching my students drift to sleep or do crossword puzzles, I do my best to communicate Cicero's ideas on the best state.  To little avail.  I did get a nice wake-up call though.  Fifteen minutes into class, I hear this awful....sound.  It is hard to describe really - imagine peppy muzak put to cell-phone-ringer.  One of my students forgot she left it on.  And had a hell of a time turning it off.  So, I made some smart comment (in my best cranky old man voice) about "Kids these days with their fancy phones.  Back in my day, we had telegrams!  Bring me my cane, boy!"  To which I heard from some student "He's 26."  So, I answered truthfully - "A lot happens in those years."  That got the most movement out of them.  How they knew I'm 26, I'm not sure.  Damn Alpha Centurians.  Knew I should have put on my "special" tinfoil-helmet.

      This morning has come with sad news.  A lady I know who works in my building, named Caroline, had a good friend die over this weekend.  Today is his funeral, passed away after the trials of cancer for six months.  His name was Wayne.  For those of you who believe, please say a prayer for Wayne's departed soul, that he may enter into Heaven and the Beautific Vision, for his family with this loss, and for Caroline in this difficult time.  For those who do not believe, please give a thought to them, in mourning and pity.

      Cna only write for a moment (about to head to Mass), but did want to share something with you.  Grading sucks.  I think I would rather straighten my teeth with a pair of rusty pliers than do this.  So, as you can see, it is going swimmingly.  I wager I shall post again soon.  After I (finally) get this done, I get to work on tomorrow's lecture.  Whoppie!  So, all nighter again.  Now the question is, "where to work on the lecture?"  I would usually say IHOP, but something tells me I may learn about the Alpha Centuri invasion if I go back there again...

      ...perhaps I am too hard on the Flyers.  I just heard from my Wisconsin buddy here that the Flyers lost in  double overtime  against DePaul.  That is a tight game!  And UD did pretty well for itself within its sphere of the basketball realm.  Sure, it shant be running with the big dogs any time in the near future, but for what it is, they are doing all right.  So, ummm, yeah!  My guys don't suck!  but release the fury, all the same.

      It appears that, once again, my dear alma mater, the University of Dayton, has disappointed on the basketball court.  My dear heart's  urlLink bracket was apparently screwed up  by the Flyers' inability to win.  A pity.  She asks, "WTF, mate?"  Well, I can't outright say.  As most of you know, I pay little to no attention to sports, any sports, all teams, etc.  But why the Flyers' problems?  I think I can sum them up in one name - Stanley.  I believe that was his name.  He was a good baller back when I was at UD....and he was also a complete thug.  Oh, how many nights would my roommates and I hear the soothing sounds of Stanley opening up a can o' whuppass on some guy outside our building?  Or read in the paper about how, when being put into a cop car, he shouted, "YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!  I PLAY BASKETBALL!!!!"  Ah, those were the days, my friend, I thought they'd never end....  But, back to the point.  Why are the Flyers not flying high?  They have lost their fear element.  Forget this varm-fuzzy nice nice stuff about power offense and good defense.  What we need are the Flyers' Flying Fists of Fury!  What better way to gain success than through some good old-fashioned brawling?  It doesn't have to be during the game: if other teams realize that winning equates with getting beat down in the lobby after the game, sooner or later they will get the message.  Release the fury.  Release the fists.  RELEASE THE FLYERS.

      all the time, God is good.  I was given a very good object lesson in the power of prayer yesterday, even without realizing it. Late last night, we had a rather strong storm here in Aggieland.  Okay, "strong" is an understatement - it was probably among the worst I have ever had the displeasure of being in.  And now a confession - I am not a big fan of storms.  When I was much younger, I was terrified of the things, generally speaking because I was terrified of the tornadoes that might spring from them.  I have recently been given a TV set, but it doesn't have anttenae or cable, so I had no idea what the warnings/etc. might be about.  But I could tell it was bad....the rain flushing through in sheets, the hail that fell, and the horrible noise of it all.  So, I will tell you straightly: I was praying non-stop for at least an hour, while shaking (it never helps when you feel the walls quaking around you from the wind).  The storm was fierce, but it passed, and things were okay.  Later today, I was once again at Coffee Station, talking with its owner, Vlad.  His shop is along the same main street as my apartment complex (Harvey Road), and he was closing up just as the worst hit.  Coffee Station usually has many devout folks in there, so I wager they were praying too.  Today, I find out that the county was in a tornado warning in the midnight hour.  And even later, that the tornado was expected to come down Harvey Road.  The funnel cloud was sighted farther away than I thought....but still well within range of my street, and my place.  And yet, it passed.  And yet, we were not hurt.  Truly, God listens to prayers and answers them, and not only from the devout.  Indeed, He listens and shows mercy to even the weakest and lowliest of His followers.   Gloria Patri et Fili et Spiritui Sancto, sicut erat in principio et nunc et semper et in saeccula saeculorum.

      I am happy to annouce that there is yet another blog hitting the scene.  It is  urlLink The Open Range , thus far consisting of myself, Dave of DC, and Kyle (the beta man?).  When the domain changes, so will the link here.  Figured y'all may enjoy on two levels.  First, it is a politics-oriented webpage - and that is always fun.  Second, that means most my politically-oriented tirades will probably occur there, so those enjoy my other rants, but find their blood-pressure skyrocketing on my political ones, can now enjoy the sheer randomness of this site, without the pain.  Enjoy.

      This is a bit of a hectic week.  It is Spring Break for the undergrads, where many of them go off to tropical locales and enjoy each others' company with (as my Wisconsin buddy here puts it) "a dose of penicillin and an open mind."  But alas, no similar rest for those in graduate school.  This is the week for catching up on teaching things, and for getting that elusive dissertation together.  So, foolishly, I promise my dissertation chair a rough draft of a chapter....and thus begins my need for caffeine.  This chapter focuses on a personal favorite saint of mine,  urlLink St. Augustine of Hippo .  While he is an interesting read and a groovy guy, he is a notoriously unsystematic writer.  Now, among the theorists here, I am sort-of the resident Augustine expert.  But to get this chapter done, I realized that I would need to read/review approximately 1500 pages of the  corpus  of the Doctor of Grace (or, in other words, the whole of  De Trinitate ,  De Genesi Ad Litteram , and  De Civitate Dei , along with some letters and shorter pieces).  Panic ensues.  Monday comes, and work must be done.  So, I go to Coffee Station (my usual place) and start reading.  And having coffee.  Now, a few weeks ago, my doctor informed me that my cholesterol levels are hovering somewhere around the Fat Albert range, and that I must really work on my eating/exercise habits (i.e. stop eating junk and actually move once in a while).  For a guy that hates cooking alone, and generally would only run (as a West Virginian friend would say) "if a psychopath with a knife was chasing me," this has generally resulted in me eating very little or not at all, out of forgetfulness.  So, the coffee runs through my veins, and nothing stops it.  At first, everything is fine.  I feel awake, I feel lively, I feel goooooooooooooood.  But, the minicrashes begin, so I order more.  And more.  And more.  Hours pass.  But I am unaware of it.  For I have reached a higher level of consciousness, and my body's molecules have achieved a higher level of speed.  For caffeine is like the spice melange - it heightens life, but it is also a poison.  But at this point, it is too late for me to stop.  I have become the Quidsatz Haderach - he who is in many places at once.  This is for both body and mind.  For body, I am vibrating so quickly that I am both above the couch, and within it.  Indeed, I am within the couch, and below it.  I am below the couch, and somehow end up in the dish-sink.  But my mind also is everywhere.  Here is a short snippet of the mind's journey, made linear for comprehension's sake: "Why are my hips in the couch? seems hot in here so Augustine has connected the  saeculum  with the animal world and the higher realm I wonder what dear heart is up to I wonder who the second ex-fiancee is torturing now "once there was no secular" remember to blog something decent what is decent?  how can Howard Stern keep an audience?  having an audience with the pope  Fides et Ratio  perhaps "flowery" was a bit harsh man my throat hurts Johnny Cash did a good version of that song someone should sing "A Boy Named Sue" for American Idol...would give it something different not different but different all the same damn rabbit-food diet the building is creaking so empty here when I give my first executive order and back at LC when writing guess I should write something today I wonder how you can write a lot I wonder how you can get Andy Rooney's job and wonder all the time have to get that ticket to the  Passion  some time  what did dear heart say about that Ecco Homo Veni Vidi Vici really need to get back to translating the Civil War again where do you buy books in Latin man Amazon.com gets on my nerves back to book right I'm reading a book, where was I again?"  That all took place in the time it takes to read, "It follows, then,..."  If only I knew physics....who needs particle accelerators when you can feel quantum movement?  Indeed, you are quantum movement.....the caffeine flows through you and you flow through the universe....sure, you may be in Texas at one moment, the next you are floating off the coast of Japan, then saying howdy to Neil Armstrong on the moon, then smacking some Alpha Centurian on the head yelling "stop reading my brainwaves!"  But then it ends.  You collapse.  Your eyes cease to function, and your will barely hangs on.  So you "take a break" (i.e. sleep for 16 hours straight).  And then.....you begin again.

      Figure I'll get this out of the way now.  First, it is an open question who exactly Presidential nominee John Kerry meant when he mentioned "other leaders" are telling him how they support Kerry's run.  But, now, we have a website to help out  urlLink here .  For Kerry's, ummm...different way of answering the question, give  urlLink this little note  on NRO's The Corner a look.  For something a little more humorous, you may get a kick out of this:  urlLink LEGO playsets  of some major social theorists (Giddens, Foucault, Butler, etc.).  While NRO has the link, I first ran into this interesting group when I got to the grad program.  Some of the theory profs mentioned the  urlLink social theorist trading cards  that the group passed out during a conference.  Yes, we are nerds, and we enjoy these things.  Resistance is futile - you will be assimilated.  And if that is still not enough, give their  urlLink action figure line  a look-at (my dissertation chariman has a printout of these on his door).  This is what social/political theorists do as jokes.  Yes, we are sad.  Humor us.  Now to something completely different: the Spanish elections.  I must say, its results have made me rather morose.  The Spanish people, in a strong, resolute voice, have told those who slaughtered their countrymen, "WE'RE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Please don't hit us again!!!!  We'll be good, we promise!"  Appeasement, sadly, lives on.  This, though, illustrates what might be the difference between the America and at least much of Western Europe.  In America, an attack happens, and the general mood, at least at the beginning, is righteous indignation at the attackers, yes concerned with security, but also very much focused on retribution by arms.  In Western Europe, it seems the reaction is understandable sadness, but matched also with this idea of negotiating or appeasing those who have already shown no concern for the civilian population.  It is a difference that makes the two perpectives difficult to communicate to the others.  Perhaps all I can say to it is:  Scite vestum inimicum.   [man, I hope I wrote that correctly]  Hopefully, I will have a comment option up soon.  I would very much dig some feedback.

      It has been a good time recently indeed.  A day or two ago, it was revealed to the high school bunch on a listserv that our good friend, Alicia-of-the-biology-teachers, has just gotten engaged!  And there was much rejoicing, as it should be.  Now, apparently, my dear heart's roommate has gotten engaged, although in a somwhat strange way.  Apparently the husband-to-be proposed with a "[Roomie], you're so damned annoying! Will you marry me?"  I wager the previous engagement mentioned didn't quite go about that way, but hey, to each their own I guess.  Ah, but life is good.  Slowly, the circle of life continues on its way, and all is well with the universe.  Congratulations to both of the brides-to-be and husbands-to-be.

      "Grrrr....varm-fuzzy nice-nice...vhat's the point of science if no one gets hurt?"  "Look at you, with your vorld peace, and your moccasin-valking, and your potpourri!  You're not mad scientists!  You're just a bunch of hippies!"  --both said by super-villian Chromedome, attending the annual Mad Scientists' Fair, in  The Tick  (Episode: "Tick vs. Science").

      Okay, thanks to assistance from the Dude, Dear Heart, and my good friend, West Coast Computer Genius, I now have some links up.  Whoo-wah!  In the near future, I will have them organized a wee bit better, but hey, small steps.  But definitely, if you don't get a chance to look at any others, give  urlLink my Dear Heart's blog  a look over.  Niftiness galore!

      I was just chatting with a fellow I am friends with (a hard-core Calvinist theorist with an office across from mine).  He said he noticed that I am much more serious this semester (I think the sports jacket, tie, and nice pants threw him off).  As he puts it, it is how they force you into professionalism, by making all your time focus on your work (teaching, writing, etc.).  Serious....more serious......what a dreadful thought.  As some might say that I was uptight already (something about making diamonds out of coal with some part of the anotomy), this is terrible.  Heck, I titled this thing with a freakin' Latin quote by Cicero!!!!  HEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well, soon there will be some fun.  I head to South Bend this weekend to see the dear heart, to attend a dance by the law school.  The dancing fool will come out!  The sleeper shall awaken!  I shall cry havok and let slip the dogs of war!!!!  Oh, wait.....that doesn't sound right.....that comes at student evalutation time ("if any of you are even thinking about giving me bad marks, let me introduce you to my hounds of hell.  I call them 'Fluffy' and 'Cuddles.'  Yes, they think you look like a mighty fine t-bone steak.  Don't screw with me.").  No, that's not right.  They are good kids, for the most part.  Heck, we talked about Augustine today - I was excited, and they didn't commit mass suicide.  So the universe and all within it are in order.  Does bleem-hunting count as too serious?  It's been fun today.  I really have to stop doing that.  Perhaps another sign of seriousness is utter randomness.  I think.  Perhaps.  I'm not sure....

      I have a tendency to say "there's always time."  I don't regret that - it is true.  However, that is a bit of a problem.  There is always time....which means so much time to squander.  I have not written the last couple days, in the hopes of getting a draft of a dissertation chapter done.  Sadly, that did not happen.  It is too easy to blow time away.  Certainly, sloth is an old associate of mine.  Kind of like that slob roommate who never leaves the apartment, even when you are entertaining a guest of the opposite sex.  The type of slob who slowly grows organically linked to some piece of furniture in your apartment.  This is the sloth that follows me.  That haunts me.  That taunts me.  It would no doubt insult me too, but that would require too much effort.  So, I spend the evening here in my office, trying to work, and getting blessed little done.  It is the great all-nighter.  Now, I originally didn't have a lot of experience with this - it was generally unnecessary in undergrad.  My all-nighters usually involved laying in bed, feeling that ninth vodka shot penetrating my stomach, as a quietly say to the ceiling "kill me.....kill me.....kill me....."  But, once I came to grad school, tha tall-nighter and I became fast allies.  But, I can tell I'm getting old.  I remember my military history prof at UD telling us that a good commander must be able to be functional for 72 hours straight.  In my all-nighters, I decided to take that challenge.  If it works for the army, heck, it's got to work for academia.  Alas, I think my record was only at a wimpy 50 hours or so (angst).  That's when the walls started moving, and I thought I could surf on the floor (as a warning, rug burns on one's feet, though rare, make up for infrequency with sheer unmitigated pain).  Now, now I can barely make 24 hours.  What happened?  It hasn't been that long!  Surely the difference of 22 to 26 can't be that drastic!  What next?  A cane?  Dentures?  Viagra?  The mind shudders....  The point of all this?  Well, there isn't one, really.  That's the problem - the first thing to go is the ability to be decisive and be conclusive.  I think.  Perhaps.  Well, I'm not sure....  But a vicious cycle ensues.  Yes, you know the all-nighter won't help.  But, you'll be awake all night thinking of all you're not doing.  So, you have the choice of laying down and doing nothing, or sitting in your office and doing nothing.  Well, except perhaps for screwing around on the internet.  Guess option two will win out any day.  I think.  Perhaps.  Well, I'm not really sure....

      I realized today that I rarely, if at all, have discussed theology here yet.  That is quite a shame.  Soooooo.....as a random thought, here are some books I might suggest for those interested in that sort of thing.  Probably one of the first nifty ones would be Etienne Gilson's  God and Philosophy, Second edition , based on some lectures he gave.  It gives an excellent summary of how the notion of God changed in history, from the views of the Greeks, going on to the major changes with Christianity, up to the modern era.  Another good work of Gilson's, though admittedly hard to get through, is  The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy .  In terms of primary theologians themselves, I must admit giving pride of place to St. Augustine.  In terms of some major philosophical works, your best bets may be  On Free Choice of the Will ,  The Trinity , or (the always popular)  Confessions .  In these works, you get a developed idea of the separation, and yet connection, that St. Augustine makes between the temporal and the eternal, and what that means in terms of salvation.  If you are more interested in a history of religious thought, especially of a different kind, I would suggest Yuri Stoyanov's  The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy .  Especially as regards Augustine, this is an interesting work - it shows the types and development of theologies that believe in "two principles," a good God and an evil one.  Trippy and educational.  Much more, no doubt, could be added, and I probably will soon.  Thus endeth the first lesson.

      Well, last night in dear Aggieland, apparently we had a concert.  The act was "Ludacris," promoting the "Chicken & Beer" album.  I can honestly say that was terribly unanticipated.  Ludacris is the fellow with the big hair that could cripple lesser men, right?  (sigh)  just can't keep up with the new hip things these days ("Boy, get me my cane!" shouts the ever-old man in my head).  Ah, for the days when flannel rocked, Kurt was alive, and Eddie Vedder was somewhat intelligible.  Seems so long ago....  Oh, a random thought.  On the high school listserv I'm on, some time ago the joys of Oregon Trail came up.  Ah, yes, that great old computer game where you head out West, with kids dying left and right, oxen crippled, and wheels broken.  Well, my friends, it has become a cultural commonality.  I'm sitting at my BoC [Bar of Choice] getting a Shinerbock, and what do I hear the group next to me talking about?  Oregon Trail.  Especially that pesky axle that always breaks.  Yes, that game today is what Virgil was to the Romans.  What that says about society, I leave to the reader.

      A slight digression from the plane experience.  Now, we will focus on a different form of transport, the car.  Last year I bought one.  On good days, I call it Pepe.  On bad days, it has many names, few of which can be reprinted on a family-oriented website.  It's a 1994 GEO Prizm.  It has issues.  You see, this car is a standard shift, not automatic.  That in itself is not bad, but Pepe is...well, Pepe does not understand how this works.  Such a standard shift car has five gears (or whateverthehell they're called), and reverse.  Clear-cut, easy, simple.  But Pepe likes to think out of the box.  So, I want to shift into third....Pepe would prefer shifting to two-and-two-thirds gear.  Or three-and-four-sevenths gear.  Or my personal favorite, fourth-and-eight-fifths gear [doesn't want to be out of fourth gear, just fourth gear plus].  This creates tension.  I yell at Pepe.  Pepe yells back [though most people seem to call it "grinding" instead of yelling].  Pepe and I start acting like an old married couple: "Why did I ever buy you?  You ruined my life!"  "Oh, go to hell!  I'm going back to mother!"  And yet, in Texas, the car is needed.  The walk from my apartment to my office is apporximately an hour and a half.  I don't want to do that in 100 degree weather again.  So Pepe remains.  And he yells.  And I yell.  And the neighbors threaten to call the cops.  But someday....oh someday.....I will have my revevnge on Pepe.  Well, either that, or Pepe will kill out on me somewhere in the middle of nowhere, and get revenge on me.  Angst.  More later....perhaps even something worthwhile.

      Planes are a devilish device.  No, I take that back - planes are fine.  Planes are good.  Planes are groovy.   Airports , on the other hand, are mini-cirlces of hell right out of a Dante poem.  Let me elaborate.  First, there is the check-in counter.  Generally, this is either staffed by a kind lady who is trying to help you (usually with a look of "you poor, doomed dear" on her face), or a fellow that you vaguely remember from your middle school homeroom class who spent his entire time drooling on himself.  So, you wait....and you wait....and you wait....and hope that they will FINALLY get around to helping you.  Or, you take another route, as I did yesterday, where you wager that the airline folks will, as usual, be running late.  Of course, that is the one time everything is on schedule, and you miss your flight.  So, you wait...and wait....and wait....as the time for the next flight comes.  Airports are exceptionally boring places, really.  You can only pace about so long, and anything you want to purchase has an additional 120% "pain fee" attached to it.  Time seems to slow down.  Your senses start to die....all before you is drab color, and that awful Muzak that gets pumped through.  So you try and rest....but the chairs are based on Inquisitorial torture devices, so you are merely more aggitated.  And so, slowly, your mind starts to give way.  You try reading, but you can't concetrate....the gray-puke-blue of the airport is slowly slipping onto the pages....the temperature throws you off as your back screams in pain...and all the while, the damn speakers are playing more Muzak.  Then, it plays the Muzak version of "Feelings."  And you can take it no more.  You see yourself jumping up and hurling your luggage at the nearest TSA representative, bellowing in the voice of a tragic hero "FEELINGS??   FEELINGS?????   I GOT YOUR FEELINGS RIGHT HERE, YOU *^%#$&^# i&%#*^%#*^% i&%$#&%$*&%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  The room goes red....little flight hats fly everywhere....the screens shatter, the windows shake.....for now the revolution has come!  Fight the machine and its winged demons!  You have nothing to lose except your bags!  Time to oppress the oppressors!  Let them take off their damn shoes and go through the metal detectors!  Let them get wanded!  Let them wait and wait and wait!  THE AIRPORT IS OURS!!!!!!!!!!!  TRAVELERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (ahem)  but I digress.  For, you see, it was all in your mind.  You have slipped momentarily into a hallucinagenic coma.  You still are waiting...in the drab, dark, crowded airport.....and yet, this is only the "wal-mart greeters" level of hell.  So much more awaits you.....  [ to be continued.... ]

      Well, just finishing off a nifty weekend with dear heart at Notre Dame, but as with all things under heaven, there are no unmixed blessings. Even at small airports, when they say "get there an hour early," they aren't kidding around.  So, here at South Bend airport, I await my new flight.  On the good side, that means no class tomorrow.  On the bad side, it means figuring out how to catch up on the lectures.  This schedule thing sucks, I must admit.  Tenure looks better and better....  On the bright side, had a nice chat with the bartender - Sherry.  This should be a catergorical imperative for any traveler - get to know your wait staff.  They are people too, and often times are quite interesting.  But, I see that my rental time with the Intenet is almost up, so more reports tomorrow.  And I PROMISE PROMISE I will have more interesting things to say in the near future.

      ....and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand." (Rev. 6:5)  Yes, I am thinking Endtime thoughts, but of a much more mundane type.  It is tax time, and I envision this man with the scales, and it is the IRS.  This year is a bit different, comparatively.  Since the earnings of a grad student aren't exactly high, it was simply a matter of filling in the little form and telling the feds they had taken too much of my income.  But not this time.  Now there are charitiable donations to deduct, tuition to deduct, and sundry other things.  So now, NOW I understand the horror of the tax code.  The term "code" is appropriate - and expert cryptographer couldn't crack this jibberish.  "Confer Form 32487."  "Review Publication 975469."  "Read Forms 8734857, 43287554, 4323985, and 5328746529 in cascading order, using the 'flip-book' format, while repeating the Gettysburg Address backwards."  I needed to do all that just to fill in the line "name."  So, you jump about, running out of printing paper to get these forms together, and grumble.  Grumble that this is necessary.  Grumble that you go through this each year.  Grumble in the knowledge that your tax money probably went to a pork-barrel government research project on salamander sleeping disorders.  Grumble that grumbling probably adds a penalty fee to your taxes.  Time passes, and the deadline closes.  You think silly thoughts: "If I don't send it in, they won't notice."  "I'm sure that an audit isn't that bad."  "Sure, I have all my receipts."  "I wonder if they have cable TV in federal prison?"  So, you struggle on.  And as the sun sinks slowly in the east, and my heart sinks slowly into my shoes [name that show], you finally reach peace with this one dreadful constant in life, the man on the black horse with the scales.  And just in time for the other one....behold, a man on a pale horse.....

      Well, before getting to work today, thought I would put down a little message.  My apologies for being away - something bloomed here over the weekend, leaving me staring at the ceiling whispering "kill me....kill me...." for about two days straight.  Yeah, fun stuff.  That, and I went to see  The Passion of the Christ  on Friday night - that takes a little while to fully sink in.  But, now to now now.  Today is a rainy, stormy day in Aggieland.  Apparently we're in a tornado watch.  I'll be honest - those things scared me to death for years.  But thus far, just rain.  Lots and lots of rain.  It's weird here, since the water table is kind-of high ("yeah, and Russia is 'kind-of' cold in winter" says the mole sitting on the second-storey window sill), so every time there is heavier than normal rain, parking lots and streets become veritable rivers.    This isn't necessarily a bad thing.  After all, it has its uses.  So, for instance - say that you are nervous about the ocean, worried about sharks, and have a deep-seated fear of starfish ("Look at those cunning little bumps on their backs!  They're planning something, I know it!"), the riverway parking lots can be used to train for surfing in a safe, controlled environment.  Or, if the color yellow makes your lips curl in moral horror, you can use these parking lots as replacement slip-and-slides.  It's fun!  ....well, until the speed bumps.  Those hurt.  A lot.  And the gravel....ooooooh, the gravel....IT BURNS, IT BURNS!!!!!!!  (ahem), but I digress.  Then, of course, there is the traffic.  No offense to Texans in general (as I do enjoy them), but these folks, as a general rule, have no driving skill whatsoever (and when a Hoosier says that, yes, they are bad).  So, while surfing/sliding about, you have to watch for SWiTLTs (Small Woman in Truck Like Tank) and DCwNDPs (Drunken Cowboy with No Depth Perception).  But, again, this adds to the fun - what could be more thrilling than surfing your wooden plank down the lot while also dodging mutli-ton wheeled chunks of metal hurdling in your direction?  Not much, true believers, not much.

Yes, you too can get blitzed, while at the same time telling others that you are delving into the mind of one of the most complex philosophers in history.  Let the lesson begin.

      I just saw that I  could  access my Dear Heart's blog, using my link from  urlLink earlier .  Huh.  Wonderments and atrocities, these are the things of the Internet.  Well, that's not all I guess.  There are also conspiracies, pornos, and day-trading.  The future isn't now.  The future was last week.

      Well, pulled yet another all nighter....making this two in three days.  I remember a military history prof of mine saying that a good commander must be able to function when awake for 72 hours straight.  As a younger man, I took that as a challenge.  Alas, I doubt I would make the cut - I managed to last a little over fifty at my high mark, then the floor got wavy and tried to swallow me whole (when I wake up, I still use my toe to check whether the carpet-tide has come in).  But alas, now I can at best do around thirty.  Could be better today.  Spent all evening working on a lecture about St. Thomas Aquinas.  Don't get me wrong, I dig the guy - he was definitely one Jules' wallet.  But, the man also wrote about 8 million words in his lifetime, and it shows.  [sigh]  Added to this, my Dear Heart's webpage seems to be on the blink for some reason, which just sucks all around.  And my credit card (that I used to buy my Mom's...um, late....birthday present) seemed to not be working.  I am almost positive I haven't maxed out the thing.  Last time I had to worry about that was during my second engagement (aka my really long dinner with the antichrist).  Ah well.  Something funny.....something funny.....well, on the bright side, I'm up to five, count'em FIVE hits.  Sure, they're only from two people.  So, to Dear Heart and Miss California (if I saw it right), thank you for your support.  This blog is, now, basically for you.  And me.  And all the voices in my head.

      Since she was just mentioned, a little more.   urlLink Paris Hilton  - there is just something wrong with that woman.  I've heard she has been on TV, but never watched the show.  I figured I should watch her previous Internet work before tackling the small screen (is Dear Heart reading this?).  Besides, if I really wanted to see rich snobs abuse we the peasantry, I'd chat with the CEO of my insurance company.  But in any case, I couldn't watch.  Because of  the eyes .  Now, it's a cliche that you can tell a lot about a person from his/her eyes, but it has truth to it.  Indeed, they are windows to the soul.  In the saintly, they show the fullness of goodness.  In the wicked, horror.  In IRS agents....well, the eyes are empty.  But then there is Hilton.  I was walking through a bookstore, and there I see Maxim magazine (or, in other words, Cosmo for the XY part of the population).  And there is Hilton spread out on the cover.  The first thought is, "You know, you'd think someone that rich could afford more clothes."  Second thought: "You'd think someone that rich could eat a little more."  But then, you see  the eyes .  It's hard to explain in a way - perhaps its the result of having enough paint to double-coat the Sears Tower around her eyes, but no, its more.  It's an odd mix of deadness and pettiness, with a shine resulting no doubt from large quantities of stimulants and depressants.  Then you realize that this person has enough money to have you killed and buried where they'll never find your body.  On the one hand, while that would be a nifty and helpful ability ("Why of course I'm interested in a credit-card, Mr. Telemarketer.  Let me just transfer you to my accountant, Rocko...."), a dreadful power in the hands of a  urlLink Veruca Salt .  And we all know the fate those types suffer - sooner or later, you go down the shaft of the bad eggs.  Fear that shaft!!!!!  And the umpa-loompas, while they might act like your friends, fear them too.  Before you know it, they'll have you caramel-coated and sent off to Jersey.  Ooooooh, fear the the umpa-loompa, and his dastardly ways!!!!!  With those small hands and freaky orange skin!!!  What the hell is that all about!!!!  Wait a minute, I think I got off track.  What was I saying?  Oh, right....  Why do I bring this up?  Huh, I really don't know.  Just felt like complaining, I guess.  So remember, true believers - in Paris Hilton hides the neck-spinning ability of Linda Blair, and never take candy from an umpa-loompa.  You don't know who it's been.

      Okay, one thing has come to mind (along with this self-observation that my writing is like my chess: completely reaction-oriented).  It comes from a  urlLink comment  I read today (while it is from a political chattering-class source, it isn't a political point, so  please  keep reading), talking about  urlLink JSTOR .  JSTOR is a trip - it is (as the comment says) an "egghead Nexis," giving .pdf files of articles in professional journals going back into the 1800s, in fields ranging from political science, econ, and philosophy to finance, music, mathematics, and archaeology.  Or, in academic-speak, " urlLink Valhalla ".  The thing is, it is next to impossible (apparently) get single-user membership to it.  I get it through the University library here, and others through professional membership.  The comment asks why the "common man" is left out.  There are probably financial reasons, but I can think of a good reason why academics, especially in the humanities and "human sciences" would not want that.  To put it bluntly, a lot of what we do is silly.  Natural scientists, for instance, might have a good argument for not making JSTOR easy-access.  Who would understand it?  Give any of us (except perhaps the boundlessly energetic School-Teacher or UW Chem Guy) the cutting-edge physics journal, and what will we get out of it?  Me, I wager I'll get the first word "The," and be rather lost from there.  But with the human-oriented things, there isn't this great divide.  Yes, a person's work is specialized, but a person's life is not.  Everybody (well, except for Paris Hilton types, that make one question the justice of the universe) has the rent or mortgage to pay, has to hit the grocery store (or other food place), has to worry about the bills, to spend time with friends, deal with the irritating, and so forth.  The constant questions of the human condition are pretty universal, even if the have differences from culture to culture.  So, back to journals.  We do many silly, or at least less-than-obviously-relevant things.  My favorite for silly comes from  Political Theory , what was the major journal for people like me.  Looking through JSTOR for this and that, I ran into an article about "remedy" prints in ancien regime France, and their connection to the fall of the aristocracy.  Let me put it more clearly, it was an article, in the flag-ship journal of political theory, about eighteenth-century porn before the French Revolution.  Articles like this might not exactly help the reputation of my academic brethren.  Or even better articles, like those by Gregory Vlastos, his Socrates one collected-up  in a book , might be pretty far afield to helping explain what one should do, how one should live, what is the good, the beautiful, the right, etc.  Well, this is a long speil.  Up-and-up, there is a good reason JSTOR is not easily accessed.  Myself, and others like me, would probably look pretty silly if it was.

      YES!  I HAVE TWO ON THE COUNTER!!!!!!!!!!  THEN I'LL GET THREE, THEN SEVEN, THEN FORTY, THEN BE THE BIGGEST BLOG IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!    urlLink  YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Sorry, easily amused.  In any case, I did have one comment for the day.  Well, I thought I did.  This is the other problem with being up, I guess it was a grand total of 32 hours yesterday - you have all these nifty ideas, but can't remember them the next day.  Then again, I wager they were the earth-shattering revelations of "have you ever really looked at your hands, man?" or "the ceilling fan, my friend....it knows my angst, it knows my happiness, and yet it stays in its place, and yet moves.  Oh, the mystery of the ceiling fan!!!!!"  Yeah.  I'll be quiet now.

      The taxes are sent in, the chapter draft sent of to da boss, the seminar stuff completed, and finally the comments/counter stuff is up.  And at this point, counter = zero.  That's fine.  I can talk with myself.  Well, no, I really can't.  Weird conversations start.  The last one began "yo, yo, mo-fo, keepin' on the down-low?"  I have no idea what that means, let alone where it came from.  On side-note, being awake for 28 hours straight stinks.  Makes for interesting lectures, though.  Oh, and please visit the  urlLink new site  - you know it must be good when starts out with "I am the man The Man is after."  Rock on.

      One more thing - if you haven't done so yet, please look through our fine variety of links.  We have the insights of my Dear Heart on law school at the  urlLink Irish-Aggie News , some strongholds of the political chattering classes at the  urlLink National Review  and  urlLink The Nation , the ongoing saga of  urlLink Sluggy Freelance  (though start at the beginning), and of course, the politicking of Kyle, Dave, Dear Heart, and myself at  urlLink The Open Range  (since I'm sure that my stunning political opinions were always the most popular thing) (I also am sure that the moon is made of cheese and that Oliver Stone has breath-taking insights on society).  Read.  Enjoy.  Stop working.

      Figured I'd add this while I was thinking of it.  After chapter/tax/seminar/lecture stuff is a bit more in control, I really really will do my best to get a comments thingy and a counter up and running.  The counter is just to see if I'm writing for myself (which I am comfortable with - the first step to recovering from involuntary solitude is accepting it), while the comments are to see your responses (you know, like "Your post on  urlLink airports  changed my life!  I have joined the revolution, comrade!!!!" "You suck.  I mean that.  Does Blogger know you write this drivel?"  "Less talk.  More rock." etc.).  On the upcoming comments, only three requests: 1.)  Keep the language to a more-or-less family-friendly level (and as a note, the Osbournes do NOT count as a family in this regard). 2.)  Keep the nudity tasteful and integral to the plot (to use a nicely-turned  urlLink phrase ). 3.)  Longer comments are welcome, but if the parts (in Roman numerals) start reaching the X range, please take a deep breath, walk around a bit, stop drinking the vodka, and stop.  Back to work.  Theoretically.  Ah, the academic life....where day and night only have meaning in terms of where you can get coffee.

      Okay, here's the thing - I'm at the office late, trying to get a dissertation chapter done among sundry other things.  So, naturally, I have decided to blow some time on various other things.  I just saw something, however, that I can't resist.  On her site, my Dear Heart had some comments regarding the recent  urlLink Miss USA Pageant .  Needless to say, there were various comments that make one cringe.  But one struck me as the worst.  As Dear Heart puts it, "And in response to "What is your favorite song?" "Gee, that's, like, the hardest question in the world." Uh huh. It's hard to be a beauty queen, ain't it. Isn't this a freaking scholarship pageant?"  Your favorite song....the hardest question in the world.  Don't get me wrong - if I was put on the spot, I'd probably not have an answer right off the top of my head either.  But hardest  in the world????   Sadly, when I read that, the first thing that came to mind was French existentialist Albert Camus.  Stop laughing....it just happens.  Anyway, in his  The Myth of Sisyphus , he has his own take on the hardest question.  And it wasn't his favorite song, or even favorite food.  His question was, in a meaningless world, is there any reason not to blow one's head off?  Yeah, he was happy-go-lucky that way.  He says yes, but I think he was just humoring himself (don't get me wrong - I'm not advising blowing your brains out.  Existentialists just have flimsy arguments for the obvious at times).  Seems a popular hardest question - I'm sure that Hamlet would agree.  Heck, even the much-dreaded  John Rawls  at least makes his hardest question: how can people live together peacefully, and not just instrumentally, in a world of deep diversity?  Ah, but I guess all that probably wouldn't sell too well at the pageant.  I'm sure that happy-to-annoyance host  urlLink Brian Pinhead  would be a bit thrown for a loop if Miss Wherever said, to who she would like to have dinner with, "My own dread, the archetype of mortality that plagues me from birth to death, the grasp of whom I can never escape, but merely accept."  Now THAT would be an answer.

      I do hope all of you had a good Easter, on this, the holiest time of the year.  Mine was both good, and included a surprise announcement.  Some background - Saturday night was spent at Easter Vigil Mass, where the service goes from 8:30 to approximately 11:30 (though often to midnight).  Yeah, that's right - we Catholics don't mess around.  The next day, a good friend of mine (the Calvinist) invited some folks over to he and his wife's house for an easter lunch of lamb (appropriately) and so forth.  He was kind enough to have me do the blessing (he asked for a bit of Latin as well, for which  urlLink this prayer  worked perfectly), but then he followed with an announcement - he and his wife are becoming parents around December.  Needless to say, we were all quite flabbergasted and joyful at this news.  But still, it is a trippy thing.  In the last year, in my department, around two or three folks, near my age, have become parents.  In the high school grouping, there are others (including the incomparable one, Elder Mo....although now that he's a dad, perhaps it is fitting to give him the more Roman sounding title of "Mo the Elder").  While this is all a part of the great cycle of life and so on, it can still be disconcerting.  I still watch the Tick ("come on Arthur - get meta with me!!!!"), find playing hopscotch with the bricks at the office endlessly amusing, and can rarely keep my apartment in any semblence of order, much less child-safe.  And yet, and yet, it is happening.  Procreation: the sure-fire, one-stop way of getting friends to stand agape at life, yelling "stop!"

      I was in the car yesterday, and by free association, a memory came to mind thanks to a Sting song (hey, the rock station was playing junk, so it was either silence or the "80s-90s-and-today" station).  Anyway, I had a memory of an Islam class I took in undergrad, taught by a Maronite priest from another nearby Catholic university (today's fun fact: the  urlLink Maronites  are a subsection of the Catholic Church, generally from the Lebanon area, whose liturgy and diocese structure is very similar to the Eastern Orthodox Church.  Basically, when the East and West split, the Maronites kept allegiance with Rome, and are allowed these liturgical, etc. differences).  And this fellow (originally from the Middle East) mentioned why he thought monotheism began in the Middle East.  In other parts of the world, there are trees, and animals, and sundry other things that can distract the person looking for divinity, and they tend to make these things divinities.  But, in the desert, it's just you and God.  I found that to be an interesting observation on many levels.  Thoughts?

      Okay, so some nights ago, I am at the BoC having a Bock, reading a little  St. Thomas Aquinas .  As I'm doing so, a drunk-as-a-skunk older local comes by, asking what I'm doing.  Note to self - the first mistake was responding.  He was asking what I was reading, and mentioned I was doing research for my dissertation.  He asked on what.  So, I told him the just war doctrine and metaphysics.  This resulted in an odd tangent about metaphysics - apparently, he has a definition of the term meaning the affects of raditation on objects.  So, I try to clarify, saying "no, it's more philosophical, ideas of higher reality, like God and all..."  He slurs, "What, you doing your thesis on ghosts?  Ghosts and war?"  Yep, he got me.  Time to stop living the lie.  I'm not really writing what I've told some of you I am.  No, I am a full-fledged member of the  urlLink parapsychological school of thought .  In the little-known major of parapsychology, I'm doing a dissertation about when, in war, it is just to use ghosts.  And there's good reason for it, too.  It's a hot topic in the history of warfare.  Don't believe me?  You should.  Think of the battle of the bulge - people think they know why it has that name, but they're wrong.  The "bulge" comes from the new hill made when the Axis powers attempted to use a earth elemental against the Allies.  You know that one scene from  urlLink Heavy Metal ?  Where the flight crew comes back from the dead?  Yeah - that's what my dissertation is on.  When is it acceptable to use the reanimated corpses, or the immaterial substance thereof, of the dead for military purposes.  You think I joke.  But am I?  After all, when in the past have drunken rednecks been wrong?

      Oooooookay.  My little  urlLink random quote contest  has just gotten interesting.  I only gave Dear Heart eight cool points, since she had one origin right (my door), but not the original origin.  She and I did a bit of conferencing on the phone, and yes, it turns out my language was equivocal.  BUT, then I check today, and see that Wendy the  urlLink West Coast Computer Genius  has made a  urlLink contribution , and is indeed correct.  The line is from the movie  Mars Attacks!  - it's the first garbled mess that comes out of a translation device the humans are using.  Sooooo.....this makes things difficult.  Now, the political scientist in me says we should handle this in the American way - send it to the electors, then the Florida Supreme Court, followed by the US Supreme Court, in a decision sure to tick off everybody.  But, then the sane part kicks in.  Sixteen cool points for Wendy of the WCCG, sixteen cool points for Dear Heart, sixteen cool points for all readers - and little flags for everybody!!!!

      One of my legion of readers ("legion" here defined as "any number greater than zero") sent me an email today, asking why there's no email link on this blog.  I could give you a technical explanation, but the real reason is that I'm a pseudo- urlLink Luddite .  I'll see what I can do in the near future.  But on to a different thought.  I have to admit, I am often times impressed by my students.  But every once in a while, I am caught speechless, and usually those are bad times.  One came in today asking what format I wanted the term paper in.  I told him I have nothing in particular in mind (thinking of how some profs have strict guidelines)....but no, we were dealing with something a bit more basic.  He wanted to know whether I wanted him to write an introduction and conclusion.  Yeah....I can honestly say, I wasn't sure how to respond to that.  The punk pedantic prof in my head suggested replying, "Sure, sonny, that's great.  Why don't I just  guess  what your paper's about.  Get the hell out of my office!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  (Mind you, this part of my mind also says things  urlLink like  "What have we here, laddie? Mysterious scribblings? A secret code? No! Poems, no less! Poems, everybody!"  He's kind-of a jerk).  Thankfully, he was restrained by that other voice in my head, the Ghost of Career Future (the Ghost and  urlLink Rick James  argue a lot.  Keeps me up at night).  I never quite realized the level of internal restraint my profs must have required.  I tell myself I could not have been that much of a fool.  Then I remember the general time-period of my first two engagements.  Then, yeah, I wager I WAS that stupid.

      My mom sent me an email recently (sent by someone she knows at church) dealing with the niftiness that is Indianapolis (or, as a dude from Detriot I met down here called it, "Nappytown."  I'm not exactly sure where he heard that name, but hey, whatever works).  Here below, I reprint it in full:  Information you must know to survive Indianapolis, IN  Welcome To Indy!  You must learn to pronounce the city name. It is: "IN- DEE -IN -AP- O- LIS."  or some call it "IN DEE A NO PLACE"...either is acceptable, however the 2nd one will get you some sinister looks.  Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere.  Indianapolis has its own version of traffic rules...the car or truck with the loudest muffler goes next at a 4-way stop. The truck with the biggest tires goes after that. (Note: Blue haired ladies driving anything have right of way anytime.)  To find anything in Indianapolis it is required that you know where the Circle is... which is the Alpha and Omega. The Beginning and the End.  Just remember, we have a tendency to name streets the same...such as Washington Street or Washington  Blvd...Michigan Rd or Michigan Street.  Of course there is East Kessler Blvd West Drive which is not to be  confused with Kessler Blvd East Drive, which are both the same street...just on different sides of town.  But that same Kessler Blvd does become 56th Street and you haven't even turned.  Speaking of confusing streets and roads, you must know that "I-465, The Loop, and David Letterman Expressway" are the same road. But the topper is Michigan Rd which depending on what part of the city you are in, it is known as SR421, Michigan Rd, Northwestern Av, Martin Luther King Dr  Now, if you get into one of our subdivisions, you are likely to find Gateway Dr, Gateway Ct, and Gateway Cir.  Please don't get lost here...you may never find your way out!!!  The morning rush hour is from 5:00 to 10:00. The evening rush hour is from 3:00 to 7:00. Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.  If you actually stop at a yellow light, you may be rear ended, cussed out or possibly shot.  Construction is a permanent fixture in Indianapolis.  The barrels are moved around in the middle of the night to make the next days driving a bit more exciting.  And if you actually see someone working on these roads, please take pictures because they'll be worth millions.  Watch very carefully for road hazards such as drunks, skunks, dogs, barrels, cones, cows, horses, pot holes, cats, pieces of other cars, truck tires, squirrels, rabbits, crows or vultures feeding on any of these items.  If someone actually has their turn signal on, wave them to the shoulder immediately to let them know it has been "accidentally activated". Everyone who is a true Indy-ite knows the little stick on the left-hand side of the steering wheel was only put there by the auto manufacturers so we'd have a place to hang  our rubber bands.  The minimum acceptable speed on "all freeways, I-65, I-465 & I-69 is 85 mph. Anything less is considered downright sissy. This is Indiana's version of NASCAR.  Never honk at anyone. Ever. Seriously. (it may be hazardous to your health).  If you are in the left lane, and only going 70 in a 55 mph zone you are considered a road hazard, and will be "flipped off" accordingly.  Ground clearance of at least 12 inches is recommended for city driving...flying low!  If it's 55 degrees and sunny, some jerk will be driving with his convertible top down but the heater will also be on.  Of course when it's 97 in the shade, that same jerk will be driving with the convertible top down but have their air conditioning going as well (do they just not grasp the concepts?)  And lest we forget, if the weather says snow...and we mean any quantity, you'd best have a month supply of bread, canned soup, tuna, milk, eggs and cereal in stock in your home because the store shelves will be empty in seconds.  Not to mention if it does snow, you won't be able to get there because we don't know  the true meaning of "how to plow"...that is of course unless you are referring to the back 40 down on the farm.  But then here in Indy slick streets are just another form of entertainment for our drivers.  Since we are talking about driving, always fill your gas tank any time on a Tuesday or Wednesday and before 2pm on Thursday.  And, you should always remember to buy gas BEFORE going to the north side of town.  Those northsiders are damn proud of their gas prices.  Gas that was 1.549 per Gallon when you went to work at 8am will be 1.769 per Gallon on your way home at 5pm that night. The higher price will always be in effect during the month of May (Indianapolis 500 race time), the month of June and July (in case you want to drive somewhere on your vacation), and most of the month of August (The Brickyard 400 time). Don't think the other months are exempt...we raise our prices on a regular basis just to see which jerk here in town will drive 45 miles out of his way to save 3 cents on the gallon.

      Well,  urlLink Dear Heart  has given an answer for yesterday's quote.  While she is right that it was on my door, that's not its original source.  As such, she gets eight cool points.  Still, there are sixteen cool points awaiting the one who knows where it originally came from.

      As Garfield would say, "Mondays suck."  You have a hint at a bad day when you can't get to sleep.  And even better hint comes when you can't get to sleep until your alarm goes off, THEN you go into a deep slumber.  So, run into class, late, and give a lecture.  I think.  To be honest, a great deal of it is a haze - for all I know, I may have been rambling in Cantonese to an empty room, playing tic-tac-toe with  urlLink my own dread .  But then it gets even better.  You see, I gave a very rough draft of a dissertation chapter to my professor before the weekend.  It is now here.  I could tell because of the puddles of red surrounding it.  And what have I learned? 1.) After 26 years of hearing/speaking English, I still lack some basic grammatical skills 2.) My idea is....well, "idea" might be a charitiable term for it... 3.) Mondays suck, like a nuclear-powered vacuum-cleaner set on overdrive in a black hole.  Mommas, don't let your kids grow up to be grad students.

      Here's something a little different.  For those of you who have swung by  urlLink The Open Range , you will have noticed that it lists me as reading a book by Harry Ricketts entitled  The Unforgiving Minute: a life of Rudyard Kipling  (I picked it up from  urlLink Half Price Books  some time ago).  Well, I have finally finished it, so I figured I would give a little review.  First, it is (of course) about the famous, or at times infamous, writer Rudyard Kipling.  While accomplished at  verse writing , he is also the author of  Kim ,  The Jungle Book , and  sundry other stories .  For some, he is known as the author of well-written children's stories.  For others, a chronicler of the Anglo-Indian life.  For others still, he is the Voice of the British Empire.  And for others, he represents Western racism.  So, let us turn to the biography itself.  Ricketts is for the most part fair with his subject, although on occasion too ready to be anachronistic.  Moreover, the biography is written in an obviously contemporary style, where "identity" and "border-crossing" become such all-consuming concerns.  But, having said all that, this is a wonderful read.  On the one hand, it is not a work that is terribly taxing - I often found myself reading it for relaxation after an exhausting few days.  More importantly, however, Ricketts does a marvelous job of placing Kipling's writings within the various points of his life, and how Kipling saw himself in the various moves he would make (from India to England, back to India, then through America to London, back to America, then back to England, etc.).  Ricketts appears to be in good control of the vast amount of evidence at his disposal, and it serves him well.  It is not a stunning biography, something that in itself is great literature, but rather serves its informative purpose expertly.  Ricketts goes on, in the end, to talk about the decline in Kipling's fortunes among literary circles, starting with his pro-Imperial writings, through WWI and its aftermath.  It is a testament to Kipling's literary skill that his works still gain a following, and a reminder that very few aspects in life, including the literary, can avoid the influence of political opinions.  If one wants an epiphany regarding what directed Kipling to become more ardently imperial, this biography only gives hints.  Or rather, it is like reading Kipling himself.  Ricketts points out that, even before WWI, people read Kipling, but in a different way.  He was no longer merely a talented writer, but he was  Kipling , the name that represented (in one's own mind) something good or ill - when reading him, Ricketts writes, people read what they expected Kipling to say, not exactly what he did say.  So too is Kipling's history: if you expect to find a man concerned with order and might through empire in a dangerous world, you'll find him.  If you expect to find a racist schooled in the superiority of Anglo-India and British hegemony, you'll find him.  Perhaps that is what makes Kipling both so fascinating and difficult, both in his life and works - he does not lend himself to easy categories.  Ricketts' biography illustrates that excellently, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Kipling, the time period he lived in, or those just interested in a good biography.  One more note: the title,  The Unforgiving Minute , comes from a poem (or verse, whichever you prefer to call it) named, " urlLink If ".  The words come from its last stanza:  "If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings -- nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run -- Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And -- which is more -- you'll be a Man, my son"

      Sorry for my lack of posts in recent days - with the end of semester, I'm realizing that not only the students, but the profs also suffer much at this time.  But it makes the mind do interesting things.  So, for instance, yesterday.  We talked about Martin Luther, and his political thought, and the distinction he makes about being both a Christian in person, and one's secular roles (or, in other words, what is the true believer to do, in actions, as both a Christian as well as a human being with relations that touch on others).  So, I (as usual) tried to think of some different style of example.  So, comes the following answer to a question on the topic:  "Well, let's take 'thou shalt not kill,' a commandment to the Christian.  Let's say that I am married to student [X].  Now, student [Y] has taken quite a bit of LSD, and he thinks student [X] has sixteen heads and is the antichrist, and is charging at her with a gun.  Now, the commandment says 'thou shalt not kill,' and as a Christian, I must follow it.  But, in my secular role, I am a husband, who by law should support and defend my wife.  And therefore, I should take out my Makarov and pump six rounds into [Y].  I don't do it in hate, to avenge or what have you.  But rather, following God's command, I am following the law on earth."  For some reason, many of my examples revolve around shooting, drugs, drinking, and so forth.  So, if I'm not fired by the end of this semester, swing on by, and see the weird realm of the political theorist.

      Well, I had planned on writing something funny, but alas, all-nighter exhaustion hit a little faster than I expected today, so instead, I wager I share something on my mind as late.  In my typical way, in spare moments of mind-drifting, I haven't been focused on my current project (dissertation chapters on Augustine and Aquinas...or, at least, that's my story....).  Instead, another project flips through mind, comparing a religious author named  John Henry Cardinal Newman  and another fellow,  urlLink Michael Oakeshott .  Oakeshott has been on my mind, and I highly suggest his works to all of you.  First, something that might turn some of you off.  Usually, Oakeshott is labeled a conservative British philosopher.  This is to an extent true, but exceptionally misleading.  He has been called a liberal ironist by Richard Rorty, a conservative by sundry types, and has even been adopted by the postmodernists (because of his views of the contingencies of  history ).  And, in many ways, they all touch on a bit of truth.  His work on history is almost postmodern, but in a better way - he sees the contingencies of history, but is not mired by them.  While he is called conservative, usually thanks to his writings in  Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays , it is a non-ideological kind.  In other words, he argues that, given the complexities of life and history, it is better to prefer the tried to the theoretical, the concrete to the abstract, the proven to the unproven.  In a way, then, he's almost a "presentist," for lack of a better word.  He was probably one of the best  Hobbes  scholars this century (superior to  Leo Strauss  and  Carl Schmitt , in my humble opinion), and in these writings, one can see his love for freedom.  But, I rant on.  He is hard to categorize, but every work of his is worthwhile.  If you happen to have some extra time, swing by your library and pick up some of his books.  It will be worth it.  Yeah, this is what sleep-deprived grad students think about in their free time.  Ah, the academic life...

      Only time for a quick one - writing lectures for tomorrow (yeah, I am that well-organized).  Last night was the birthday of my buddy from Wisconsin, so a group of us decided to go out.  As time passed in the evening, we decided to play some poker.  I learned many things that night.  Most importantly, you need to have the right poker face.  Okay, addendum - after actually learning the rules and having some cash to throw in, THEN the most important thing is the pokerface.  Some of the guys decided to bring sunglasses, and this may not have been a bad idea.  But I was hoping for something different.  Something more astounding, that would wow my opponents and keep them always uncertain of my actions.  I went back to my youth, delving through my memories to find the right way to play it out.  And I found it....in  urlLink Pokerface .  Alas, after three hours of trying, I couldn't get my eyes to look like a slot machine.  And so, I was not the big winner.  Curse the Silverhawks for lying to me and giving me false aims!  CURSES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      For many folks, now is the time of writing term papers and completing final exams.  And that is stressful.  It stinks.  It is no fun.  I remember those events, and do not envy the student.  But all I ask, is some sympathy for the professor.  I am currently working through grading papers, and about to go home to see if that works better.  And it sucks - the student writes one, the professor grades twenty-seven.  To be fair!  To be consistent!  It is no fun.  Added to this, every student who has walked through my door has said the line "I need an A in this class" at some point or another.  I have no doubt they are correct - I would be stunned to hear any come in saying, "yeah, you know, I really need a D in this class.  An A just won't work, but a D, now that's another story...."  And I would like to grant all A seeking students their wish.  But there is that fairness thing.  More immediate, there is that whole questions-on-my-teaching-capacity-from-the-liberal-arts-college fear ("Listen, Dean Suchandso, I simply believed the best way to integrate in an understanding of redistributive justice was by giving an egalitarian grade allocation - surely you can approve of such a pedagogical process?  ....  Whaddaya mean I'm fired??????").  And so, I wrestle through.  One prof offered this suggestion: Take all the papers to the top of a staircase.  Toss said papers.  Whichever land at the lowest point get an A - you see, since obviously that paper was so filled with content, it simply found its rest at the lowest point.  And decrease grades the closer they fall to you.  You have no idea how tempting that is.  The days are long.  The nights are long.  The time to the deadline, however, is short.  Ah, for an end to the semester...

      I have thought about the future.  Very often.  What to do if this whole PhD thing doesn't work out?  (For those of you who are new here, I'm doing a grad degree in  urlLink parapsychology )  For years, I wagered the next career-of-choice would be doorman, but now I know what it would be -  urlLink sushi bartender guy .  How cool would that be?  Sure, there's always that danger of causing a mass epidemic of food poisoning BUT we won't think about that.  You get to make sushi, drink sake, wear trippy robes, and yell "HYAI!" a lot.  Now that would be pretty groovy....  It came to mind as I was having some sushi last night.  But I was distracted, because I met some actual Gnostics there.  I knew, speculatively, that there were still folks like that around, but never actually met them.  Seemed nice enough....superficial thinkers, but nice enough.  Then I found out that apparently their little "study group" churchish thingy was led by a tenured full professor in history ( not  from Aggieland, I'm happy to say).  A full professor in that stuff....yeah, makes sushi bartending all the more appealing....  That was tangential.  I don't want to grade term papers.  I'm avoiding work.  Get me out of this.  Help.  Help.  Must go to my happy place....must go to my happy place...  Screw that....help!

      So, naturally, after going off like that, one of the computer guys shows up pretty soon and helps me out.  Yeah....real nice on my part....  Then again, though, I think the anger was necessary.  I wager they help you out more after you've turned green, tripled your size, and smashed a table.  Oh, one thing though - the comics and the TV series lied.  When the shirt rips, the pants rip too....and so does everything else.  That's embarrassing enough, but especially after you return to normal, nothing looks quite as....impressive.  Okay, I'm revealing too much about revealing too much.

      Okay, a real quick one.  Computer is still on the blink, so using another one real quick.  And that leads to my anger of the day.  I mean this as no offense to any who may be in this field, but I hate computer staff people.  THey are an odd type - indeed, as the technology increases, they seem to become more pre-modern.    You start out by sending an email, asking for help - your machine is running out of space with no cause, and you are losing the ability to write papers, and indeed send emails.  No response.  For, you see, it is not for the serfs to call upon the masters - the masters will call you.  So, it gets worse.  You walk to their office, seeing them working away on code, or (often enough) the Internet.  You tell them, "Listen, my computer has ceased to function - I can't write, I can't open emails, I can't really do much of anything.  Could you maybe help me out?"  The response, "Sure, I'll be over in a couple minutes."  This is "a few minutes" in Roman time - so, in other words, 3 hours to 5 days.  So you wait....you try to be nice....you realize you could probably earn a bloody computer science degree by the time they arrive....and you grow more angry.  You see binary in front of your eyes....and it taunts you.  The user gets more frustrated...he starts to lose his cool....USER MAD!!!!!!!!  USER SMASH!!!!!!!!!!!  USER SMASH LITTLE COMPUTER MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGH!!!!!!!!!!!  Ahem....but I digress.  So, up and up, I am not a fan of computers right now.  And I am less a fan of human beings.  Such is life.

      Well, it's been a couple days.  I promise I'm not slacking off.  My computer is having some....issues.  You see, its memory keeps filling up on the hard drive.  Why, or from what source, remains undetermined.  So, up and up means that I generally can do about seven or eight operations before the bloody thing has to be shut down and restarted (which takes some time).  (sigh)  The joys of modern technology.  So, stay tuned true believers - more will be forthcoming.  As a side-note to consider: be happy when you deal with intelligent people.  Most of my students are.  But every once in a while, I get this: "Listen, I've been working on my paper comparing Plato and Aristotle, and I've got about three pages, and I've answered the question.  What should I do?"  A comparison that has spilled so much ink in the last 2000 years....and you have "answered the question" in three pages.  I would hope that means you're a genius....for your sake.  More soon.

In it, she explains why she is a big fan of the movie  urlLink  Deep Impact  .  No, perverts, that's not the name of a porno....ummmm, at least, I assume it's not one.  Well, there was this Ron Jeremy film sort-of entitled that called....ummm, well at least that's what I  heard ....

      This is a trick....I'm trying to get better about writing at least something each day, but I'm not sure what to add.  When I wrote a column back in high school, the teacher said that each columnist has that chance to write a piece on procrastination, but no more.  I blew my one at that very time.  But, I am procrastinating now, on my grading.  It's no fun.  But something fun to write....ah, to be Andy Rooney, where you could start a rant on "have you ever really thought about shoe-laces?  I have..." and still have some level of popularity.  I guess bushy eye-brows help.  I don't have them (or, at least you don't  know  whether I do or not  ha ha ha [rubbing hand together maniacally]).  The rains have stopped somewhat.  I plan on sending out a dove later, just to be certain all is well.  Huh...not much else.  Even all the voices in my head are bored.  And that's not a good sign - usually I can at least depend on frat boy who never was and Rick James to compare notes on sundry illicit substances.  Well, to work them.

      Thankfully, the more destructive storm elements (hail, lightning, tornadoes, etc.) seem to have stopped in the area, leaving only the fun of flooding.  Apparently a record was broken today - 4.4 inches of rain so far, and more on the way no doubt.  Now, you see, this part of Texas at least has a rather high water table.  That means that if it even rains half an inch, expect parking lots to become rivers.  This even moreso.  So, roads are closed.  Rivers are flooded.  And I half expect my second-storey apartment to begin sailing its way to the Gulf of Mexico at any moment.  Might be nice...haven't really been to the Gulf yet....but I wager all the people from the lower floors would want to join in.  Could be a party.  Or could be  urlLink the raft of the Medusa .  And that wouldn't be fun...too much misery and not enough sails.  Can you say sleep deprivation?  Good, I knew you could.

      The world looks odd today.  I was out a little too late last night at a friend's party, and was looking forward to getting some sleep.  Then a downpour starts.  Then the thunder and the lightning.  Then tornado warning #1.  Then flood warning.  Then severe thunderstorm warning #1 (since, obviously, everything had been peaceful up to that point).  Then tornado warning #2.  Flash flood warning.  Severe thunderstorm warning #2.  And it's not even noon yet.  Ah, Texas weather....such fun.  So, I have had little to no sleep, I am somewhat hung-over, and need to wake up enough to go to some meetings today.  This is an accursed Thursday....but Friday I'm in love.  That was random.  It's time to stop now.

      Two things have come to my attention recently, and I ask you all to keep those involved in your prayers.  One very good friend of mine recently was laid off - should be okay for a while, but pray a new job will come soon.  The father of one of my colleagues passed away about two days ago.  Her father had been suffering from a lung alignment for some time, which finally took his life.  Please keep my colleague, her father's soul, and her entire family in your prayers.  Thank you.

      Given my  urlLink love/hate relationship  with machines and such, I thought you might all dig this little addition from Peter Kreeft called " urlLink Confessions of a Computer Hater ."  One of my favorite lines?   The university that employs me gave every one of its nearly 1,000 professors a free computer. Having had no luck with IBM PCs in the past, I asked for an Apple. “They’re user-friendly,” said friendly users.  One fact should have made me suspicious: Computers are the only thing the university has ever given away. It doesn’t even give away free books. Just think about it: Who gives expensive stuff away? Missionaries and drug dealers.   Oh, the devil gave away an apple, too. And look what came of that.   Read it all - groovy stuff.

      Well, it is a rainy day here in Aggieland - an odd rainy day, really.  Started out moderately cloudy, but quiet...and then, downpour, with much thunder and fury.  Now, on days like this, one could enjoy the dodging of  urlLink SWiTLTs and DCwNDPs , but it may have been raining even too much for that.  So, what to do, what to do....you  could  just stay inside where it is dry and temperature-regulated, but where's the fun in that?  So, what else to do?  There is the ever popular outdoors shower - instead of wasting time in the bathroom, why not just take your soap and shampoo with you, and cleanse on the way to your location?  It's loads of fun, and you can meet new people.  The only downsides are that it can be a bit cold, that other people doing the same thing really shouldn't walk around naked...well, anywhere, and the new people you meet might be in the employment of your local police force.  Then there's steel-siding roulette.  It's like Russian roulette in a way, but instead of a pistol, you and your friend run about in an open field, each taking turns holding a big sheet of metal.  Last one electrocuted wins.  Much fun, and the poor-man's way of recreating scenes from  urlLink The Deer Hunter .  Finally, there is a tried and true past-time, started with the Greeks (of Harvard University), called "extreme flagpoling."  Following the usual frat routine of stringing underwear up a flagpole, this takes it to a whole new level - you string it up, while its owner is still in it, during a rather large thunderstorm.  Much fun is had by all, and it is a wonderful way of eliminating  I MEAN  interacting with your worst enemies.  Yeah, rainy days bring doldrums to the creativity.  Such is life.

      All right - yet another one for y'all, for a grand total of 16 cool points.  Where is this line from (and, for clarification, no it has not been on my door - what  movie  is this from)?  "...You form the Tempest. The sand stings my eyes and the Ground is parched. I roar in defiance but you do not hear. But between us there is a difference. I, like the lion, must remain in my place. While you like the wind will never know yours."  An additional eight points if you give the full name and title of the character from whom this quote comes.

      Well, finally got the grading done last night....just in time to head into the school today to hand out final exams, so yet more stuff to grade.  (sigh)  I must admit, I did not envy to see the reactions of some of my students.  I am especially not looking forward to the no-doubt line of the disgruntled wondering why they got such-and-such a grade.  Oh, well....at least soon it will be done....and then I can try and do all that work I haven't been doing lately (that dissertation I am rumored to be working on....).

      I just found  urlLink this wonderful collection  of "In the Year 2000" lines from the Conan O'Brien show.  I mention this because, some time ago, I mentioned the word " urlLink bleem ."  Now I know that it wasn't just those alcohol-induced false memories playing games with me.  Now, if I could just remember whether or not I actually did join a secret society of assassins in Shanghai during the 1990s....

      Before I head out tonight (and this will probably be a once-a-week thing from now on), thought I'd point out some books and such that have recently caught my attention, and wallet.  --  The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken  , by Terry Teachout.  Mencken was the journalist back in the day, known for his harsh words and pseudo-nihilism.  Teachout is the excellent art critic for the  Wall Street Journal  and  Commentary  (among other things), and his blog,  urlLink About Last Night , can be found on the sidebar.  --  A Collection of Essays   by George Orwell.  Orwell, famous for his works   Animal Farm   and   1984  , was also a remarkable essay writer.  In this collection, Orwell addresses sundry things, including Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling (the big reason I bought it was for that), the monumental "Politics and the English Language," and also his reflections on the Spanish Civil War (it is odd, in these days, to hear someone still dedicated to class conscienceness like Orwell was).  Certainly, never dull.

      Everything's bigger in Texas, so the line goes.  And this is true - big trucks, big people, big open spaces, big accents.  But it is not limited to these...no, there are other, more disgusting things that are bigger, too.  This is the tale of Gargantuan the Ugly.  The most recent experience starts two nights ago, going to do my laundry at 11 p.m.  I go to the apartment laundromat; it's hot, it's humid, I'm not looking for trouble.  But something... moves ...on the floor below.  Is it a tile?  No...rather it is the dark inhabitant of the woody and wet realms of East Texas....it is the master of the dank domains and districts of the region...it is....  Gargantuan  .  What is this thing, this ruler of all he surveys?  Gargantuan is what is euphamistically called a " urlLink palmetto bug ."  It is a cockroach, but one only slighter smaller than bloodhound, with the strength of many Mongols, and bullet-proof armor.  You may think that " urlLink palmetto " means "any of several usually low-growing fan-leaved palms," but the dictionaries have it wrong.  They think it is a modification from Spanish.  But no....it is a word from the native tribes of the South, where "palmetto" means "monstrous many-legged winged beast that swoops down from the sky and eats chihuahuas for snacks."  The ancient peoples could really fit a lot into a small word.  In any case, that is what Gargantuan is.  Specifically, scientists refer to him and his foul ilk as  pestilencus freakingrossicus , of the  inducere-vomens  phyla.  They are large.  They are mean.  They are very susceptible to radioactive change - it took a nuclear bomb to wake up  urlLink Godzilla , but get a stronger glow-in-the-dark watch around these things, and they will be in the Tokyo-ravaging weight class in about two hours.  But to Gargantuan himself.  Called "the Ugly" (because his antennae go all over the place), he scours the apartment complex I live in for new victims....cats to battle, exterminators to terrify, young coeds living on their own for the first time to "like, seriously, gross out,  totally ."  He is a vicious sucker that way.  And here, two nights ago, he stood between me, and the only clean underwear I had.  Obviously, a titanic battle would soon ensue.  I needed to find my  urlLink ki , my center.  But instead, I found my  urlLink Che , which made me want to smoke cigars and invade Cuba, and dammit  there's no time for that right now!!!!   Gargantuan, for his part, looked at me warily, making those insidious clicking noises.  But I was not afraid - my boxers were on the line!  But then, an idea occurs to me - noise!  The one thing that can distract the monster, the loud sound of shutting a dryer!  But would it succeed?  Or would Gargantuan, infused with fury, take flight and slam me into next Tuesday?  But it was too late for thinking...the choice must be made.   BANG!   Gargantuan shivers, for the sonic waves are too much for his nerves.  He walks away, slowly....but he knows I'll be back.  And when that time comes....Gargantuan the Ugly will release his wraith.....  And here you thought folks in Texas just enjoyed the sunshine.  Think again.

      Having said all that, this new template stuff (which looks a bloody lot more complex than the old one) frightens and confuses me.  The old template basically had a guidepost for dummies in the actual code saying "you can put links here."  Now, it is not.  Any help is appreciated - just leave it in the comments section.

      Well, as you can see, the blog is looking a might different now.  There are a few reasons for this.  Actually, there is one reason for this - an "intermittant bug" that apparently has bothered blogger for some time.  Genius that I am, I didn't realize that it could be avoided by merely choosing a different template.  Well, after a week, now I have.  And, apparently, I have lost the comments, and all my links.     So, this is what we will do.  I will get this all back together, and hopefully soon actually write something interesting.  And so it begins....again.

      "Objection" is an overly-used term in legal language.  What would be a good replacement?  "SEDAGIVE?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!!?!?"  That would work - gets the point across, indicating both anger and amazement at the move by opposing counsel.    Indeed, I wager we might see the Igor (pronounced "Eye-gore," not igor) Principle any time now from the highest court.  Obscenity cases will involve terms like "woo-woo" and "balloons."  Jury selection will include the "Yogurt" clause.  As well it should - that is law for the masses, true believers - no more of this Latin lingo and such, but rather regulations brought to you through the words of  urlLink Mel Brooks .  What brought this to mind was a book I read some time ago, entitled   A Matter of Interpretation  .  Its main author is Supreme Court Justice  urlLink Antonin Scalia , followed by commentaries from historian  urlLink Gordon S. Wood , constitutional scholar  urlLink Laurence H. Tribe , legal scholar  urlLink Mary Ann Glendon , and philosopher of law  urlLink Ronald Dworkin , and a response from Scalia.  Specifically, it came from Glendon's piece, where she uses a running gag from   Young Frankenstein   about  urlLink Marty Feldman's  hunchback moving about to illustrate a point about legal interpretation.  Keep in mind that these types of books are generally exceptionally dry - about the only "fun" you'll have is seeing someone try an make a point using   The Odyssey  , realizing that the author has no bloody clue what he's talking about.  So, how does this respected jurist respond?   There is nothing I take sharp issue with in Professor Glendon's elegant statement, unless (for those familiar with  Young Frankenstein ) it is her failure to work in the Feldman-Wilder "Walk this way" routine.   Holy freakin' jeez - a legal treatise with Gene Wilder thrown in.   That , true believers, is the law of the future.  A future where the law requires evidence be submitted using the "three syllables, sounds like..." rule.  Where scalpels and thighs are used instead of gavels.  It is the way of the future....it is the way of progress...it is the way...of Brooks.  Prepare for a brave new world.

      Since I am leaving for Portland soon, and am running a great deal farther behind than expected, I'll be doing something a little different for most of the week.  Back in undergrad, I did an email column, and just recently found some of them.  Those were back in the days when I had a sense of humor (I know, I know...suspend your doubt for a moment).  Anyway, I'll be reprinting some of those during the coming week, and if I have more time, I will do a little additional stuff.  For all six of you, my true believers.  But, that will start later.  Now, to the Supreme Court and there-wolves.

      ....as well as those of you wearing clothes, today is an important day.  On this day, five-hundred and fifty-one years ago, the Byzantine Empire's capital city, Constantinople, fell to the Turks (now called Istanbul).  It is the day the Roman Empire (the eastern empire specifically, the last remnant of it) ceased to be.  Thank you.  This has been the educational part of the program.  We now return to utter inanity.  As a personal note - this is post #100.  Yeehaw!  And they said it couldn't be done.

      There is this saying in Aggieland that, once you do something twice, it becomes a tradition ( urlLink ring-dunking  being a typical example).  Well, since we've done this  urlLink once before , and are doing it again, let the tradition begin!  Here are some books that have recently caught my attention, and wallet.  --  The Landmark Thucydides: A Comprehensive Guide to the Peloponnesian War  , with notes and such by Robert Strassler.  This is an excellent translation of Thucydides' work, containing comments/information for each paragraph, as well as many maps.  That helps, since most of us don't exactly have the geopolitical structure of ancient Greece at the forefront of one's mind.  Additionally, it has an introduction and bibliography by the master of all military history he surveys,  urlLink Victor Davis Hanson  (the indomitable VDH).  --  The Basic Works of Aristotle  , by, well....Aristotle.  I have to admit a little bit of embarrassment about this one - being political philosophy guy, I should have purchased something like this a long time ago (I'll just lay the blame with my undergrad institution - bloody degree-mill).  Basically, it's this - I'm reading through Aquinas'  Summa Contra Gentiles , and (naturally) St. Thomas is using a great deal of Aristotle's terminology.  You can wing it for a bit, but without having read  Categories  or  Physics  (among others), you realize you're missing some pretty important things in what's being said.  Proving once again that, if you really want to understand a thinker, you can't merely focus on what interests you (political theory, aesthetics, etc.), but rather you must read him as a whole.  Wish I'd learned that lesson earlier, but hey, them's the breaks.  -- urlLink TASCHEN  Books.  This is not one book  per se , as much as a collection of them.  Since my knowledge of art is plebian at best, I'm trying a bit of self-enculturation using the TASCHEN art book collection (usually through  urlLink Half Price Books  or some such).  So, recently during a jaunt to Walden Books, they had a collection of them cheap - so now I can try an understand the art of  Rembrandt  (picture  urlLink here ),  Vermeer  (picture  urlLink here ),  Munch  (picture  urlLink here ),  Matisse  (picture  urlLink here ),  Rivera  (picture  urlLink here ),  Picasso  (picture  urlLink here ), and  O'Keeffe  (picture  urlLink here ).  [Hat-tip to  urlLink Mark Harden's Artchives , where these images were located, and where you can find so much more]  Usually, these books collect the artworks nicely, although the commentary can be hit and miss (so, the Rembrandt book has excellent commentary, while any book done by Gilles Neret tends to be sex-crazed gibberish).  I have no idea whether these books will help, or just make me a philistine, but in any case...the pictures are pretty.  Yeah, deep aesthetic thought.  It's Friday, whaddaya expect?

      Just when you think it's safe to be nerdy, something comes along.  This June, I'm spending a couple weeks in Portland, Oregon, for a seminar with the ever-groovy  urlLink Erasmus Institute .  And I was, and am, looking forward to it.  Alas, apparently Oregon has some other...peculiar elements.  Abu Hamza al-Masr, the mad cleric of London,  urlLink has been indicted  by the US.   He is accused of having a role in a December 1998 hostage-taking attack in Yemen in which four people were killed and trying to help al Qaeda set up a "terrorist training camp" in Bly, Oregon, from October 1999 to early 2000.    That is good to know, though.  If I should be invited to a "more proactive kind of religious camp" while hanging out there, I'll be sure to think twice.

      That's not quite true - we actually have a rather easy-going life.  Not much in the way of a schedule.  Being surrounded by the wisdom of the ages always.  Making your own plans and time-tables.  But therein lies the problem.  That's all swell and fine...but when a constant roommate in your head is Sloth, you find that things get pretty hectic pretty quickly.  So, at this point, have to deal with a student, work on revisions (yes, I too might get published - and the seventh seal was opened, and the angel said, "come and see..."), work on dissertation, watch a buddy's house while he and the mrs. are away, get ready for a seminar in about a week, and try my best to ensure my little plants don't die of neglect.  You see, this is why I like philosophy - one of the benefits (among many) on the study of eternal and constant things is they'll still be there after you're dead and gone.  If you are a slacker, in the greater scheme of existence and Being it won't matter.  Things will still operate as they did, the grand Divine history will continue, and all will go as it should.  Unfortunately, for the concrete contingent existence of my plants, I lack that luxury.  That was all random.  But with a point - not much to report today.  But can't leave it at that...well,  urlLink MerMer  mentioned Britney Spears...sadly, all that comes to mind is a paraphrase of  urlLink a little poem , from the hit-and-miss (but still worthwhile) Don Knotts/Tim Conway comedy  The Private Eyes :   [Britney] is dead, and here's something to note. You can't bury her at sea, 'cause her bosoms will float.   Okay, that was just unnecessary.  I will stop now.

      Last night, I swung by the  urlLink BoC  for a  urlLink Bock .  That night, the niftiest waitress ever, Katie, was serving (alas, this being her last week).  She noticed I was reading some  Aquinas  (as I tend to do there), and decided to share with me some "existential wisdom" she had learned from the bar life.   "Women want many things, but from one man.  Men want only one thing, but from many women."   I don't know if I would call it "existential" as much as anthropological wisdom, but seems true enough.  Discuss amongst yourselves.

      I understand that sometimes it is necessary to bring your kids to the workplace.  I know sometimes you just don't have the time, luxury, or finances to avoid that.  But for the love of God, try to keep your hellions under control.  I'm sitting in my office, hearing these horrific noises from the hallway - I check, and what do I see?  Two five year old boys, who have decided to make the office building their own personal WWF wrestling ring.  The shouting, the crying, the  banging against the walls ....you want to say something, like "Get out of my hallway, ya damn kids!"  But you cannot.  Apparently these days, actually saying something to another person's children is uncouth, mean, tactless.  That these kids seem to have about as much adult supervision (and connected discipline) as the boys in   Lord of the Flies   is apparently irrelevant.  Thankfully, there were no pig heads around, or we probably would have some type of pagan ritual going on here.  So please, those of you with offspring, do us all a favor - teach your kids how to behave in public.  Or if nothing else, keep them under control.  Leashes are acceptable.

      Well, I have returned from Houston, and it was a good time - as you may have noticed, the Astros  urlLink pimp-slapped  the Cubs last night.  Persian food was good, and a fun time was had by all.  Until we tried to leave.  For those of you unfamiliar with Houston's highways and such, "concrete hellhole" is a good description.  The roads going in-and-out of the city give you the feeling of a roller-coaster: they go up, they go down, you want to hold your hands up yelling "YAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGHH!!!!" as you drive on them.  The difference is, roller coasters have an end to them - here, if you get on the highways, you may never get off.  When I am more up-and-about, I will spend more time on the dread horrors of those roads.  But not today.  Too good of a mood.  Art books all about - will talk more of it soon.  But for the moment, must get back to the dreaded real world of three dimensions and obligation.

      I'm afraid I can't write much today - just came in to check the email and all.  Why, you ask (or even if you didn't)?  Because today some of the fellows in the department and I are headed down to Houston, for an all-around good time.  And this is why I dig America - where else can you start out hitting a rocking  urlLink wine/liquor store , have lunch at an Iranian restaurant, and then move on to have a beer and watch the  urlLink Astros  take on the Cubs?   Only in America , true believers, only in America.  Well, okay, there is one downside.  The game is held at  urlLink Minute Maid Park .   Minute Maid Park .  Do you have any idea how hard it is to take a masculine game seriously when it's at a place called Minute  freakin'  Maid Park?  What next?  Will I be watching the Indiana Pacers out of the Metamucil Fieldhouse (as if that Conseco nonsense isn't enough...).  Will the Dallas Stars be playing in the Post Oat Bran Coliseum?????  Well, I guess that, too, is only in America.  Take the good with the bad, I guess....

      The blogosphere is Berlin in the late eighteenth century.  It is London in the late seventeenth century.  It is Paris...well, pretty consistently since the French Revolution on.  The blogosphere is all of these, wrapped up into one overwhelming whole.  What does it mean to say this?  Simply put, the blogosphere now seems to fit the space that pamphleteers and small journals in ages past once held.  Where once groups of individuals would come together to create, say, the  Berlinischer Monatsschrift , today any individual with a computer, Internet access, and time can do the same.  Indeed, where in previous ages, the writers needed to be near to one another, now an online weblog can include people from Texas, DC, Indiana, California, and England in realtime.  The flurry of ideas that one could see at those points in history has now come to the masses.  Or has it?  The expansion of weblogs provides both information and chaos to the intellectual scene, regardless of what particular genre is involved.  While earlier eras saw numerous pamphlets and small gazettes, today weblogs appear as almost an infinity.  What can one make of all this?  While the type of interactions are similar, and indeed surpass, those of previous times, the limits of the medium and the sheer saturation of the field leave the weblog as a mixed blessing.  Let us consider the wonder and anarchy that is the modern blogging scene.  This all came to mind from a discussion I saw at  urlLink The Spence's We Three , regarding rules and such of blogging.  What rules are there?  There seem to be four - know your role, compete actively for information/links, specialize, and obey the BNtSG Rule.  Let us examine each in turn (as a note - most of the examples will relate to political blogs, as those are the ones I am most familiar with.  However, theoretically this could apply to any genre beyond personal "for friends" weblogs).  First, the  know your role  rule.  Basically, the blogger should understand where s/he stands in the geography of interblog relations.  These relations are structured by the sources of information and attention.  There are three basic groupings - information storehouses, commentary mandarins, and the great periphery.  While these groups are not totally sealed off from one another, they are recognizably different.  -- Information Storehouses  are not primarily, if at all, blogs - rather, they are the major "news" centers, broadly defined.  So, this would include online newspapers and the like ( urlLink  New York Times  ,  urlLink CNN ,  urlLink Drudge Report ,  urlLink FOX News ), but also includes, for lack of a better word, ideological news sources ( urlLink  National Review  ,  urlLink  The Nation  ,  urlLink  The American Prospect  ,  urlLink  The Weekly Standard  ).  These are the types of sources that move the weblogs - they provide the links, the points of interest, the issues of the day.  Through them, the weblogs have a starting point of discussion.  The only primary blogs that fit into this picture are those with unique access to information ( urlLink Iraq the Model  being a good example).  These storehouses provide the material. -- Commentary Mandarins  are the major bloggers. This can result from the blog being connected to an information storehouse (so, for instance, NRO's  urlLink The Corner ), the blogger being somehow involved or known in the specific genre ( urlLink Instapundit  could qualify here, as well as  urlLink Mirror of Justice ), and/or by simply being an excellent commentator in some way or another.  These blogs are the major force in the weblog field - these are the blogs that the general Internet population will judge others by, and more unknown bloggers will sacrifice an arm and a leg to get a link or mention on these blogs.  Usually, there will be a slew of links to these mandarins, but the mandarin pages themselves range from few to no links, to a long list of them.  Again, if an unknown can get on the list, they are set for a high number of page views (which, for many, is the point). -- The Great Periphery  makes up the rest of the blogosphere, and it is the vast majority.  Whether started on a whim, alone or with friends, these weblogs generally have rather small and localized audiences.  If the Information Storehouses are RCA and Virgin Records, and the Commentary Mandarins are The Rolling Stones and U2, the Great Periphery contains the garage bands that play for the locals, at best.  While many of these are content to remain small-time, keeping friends and family informed or to just express one's views, some still hope for the big time.  They may fill their pages with links.  They may market out their blogs or specific posts to the Commentary Mandarins, or sundry other avenues.  Most will fail.  In knowing one's role, the blogger must understand where in the foodchain s/he operates, and act accordingly.  A member of the Great Periphery cannot expect to become an  urlLink Erin O'Connor  or  urlLink Eugene Volokh  just by posting, while these two bloggers shouldn't try to peddle their posts to random pages.  Acting outside the constraints of the interblog arena would be like Costa Rica attempting to invade Russia.  The second rule, and involves the Great Periphery's relationship to the Commentary Mandarins, is to  compete actively .  As mentioned above, this involves trying to "sell" the product of your blog to whatever major blogger will accept it.  But, naturally, that means you are competing against Lord knows how many folks in the exact same position.  This is especially difficult since what you write may not be that different from what everyone else writes.  Unless you 1.) have unique information, 2.) are exceptionally witty, or possibly 3.) you just catch the Commentary Mandarin on a day when there's not much else to post, chances are, your blog will blend in with the hundreds already out there.  Even writing this, I have this horrible feeling that someone will put in the comments section, "Hey, that's great - but didn't you see the  X  weblog six months ago?  He said the same thing...."  The third rule, and perhaps the most understandable yet still problematic, is  to specialize .  In effect, weblogs can't be too broad, too scatterbrained, or too all-encompassing.  Unlike, say, some gazettes of old where you might have political commentary, philosophical ponderings, aesthetic reflections, and biting satire all in one place, it is the natural tendency in the saturated blogosphere to narrowly tailor one's discussion.  In the Great Periphery, this is of great importance, since (hopefully) your consistent activity will gain the attention of the Commentary Mandarins.  Among the Mandarins themselves, the posts do not have to be as narrowly tailored, but still within a certain genre (so, it is doubtful that the  urlLink Junk Yard Blog  will be delving into the Mozart G Minor Symphony, and  urlLink Terry Teachout  probably won't be focusing on steel tariffs in the near future).  In effect, for a blog to be successful, it cannot be the Ed Sullivan Variety Show of the Internet.  Forgive me a personal digression as an example.  Originally, this blog was for whatever came to mind - but, when my  urlLink third post  was of a more political nature, my readership dropped from a stunning seven to about three.  So, thankfully, a buddy of mine wanted to start a group blog on politics, and thus I could specialize - one for humor/random thoughts/general reports (this one), and another for  urlLink political commentary .  That helped the numbers, although compartmentalizing can at times be a trick.  But it is the way of the arena.  The final one is  obey the BNtSG Rule .  "BNtSG" stands for " urlLink Bill Nye the Science Guy ," the beloved Mr. Wizard of the current generation, known especially for having a TV show that appeals to kids with the  urlLink cumulative attention span of a fruit fly .  The rule of the weblog, then, is keep it short.  One should not write some version of  urlLink "What is Enlightenment?"  or the like, because no one will read it (of course, just writing " a priori " twenty-seven times in one paragraph could do that too).  So, obviously, if you are still reading this, I may be mistaken.  But let's just say this is the exception that proves the rule.  To make it in the blogosphere, you have to in a concise, witty, unique way, comprehensively address an issue that no doubt 473 other people are also trying to address in a concise, witty, unique way.  What are we to make of all of this?  On the one hand, that there could be this stunning level of information and input is itself wonderful.  But it comes at a cost.  As the weblog arena becomes increasingly crowded, with countless voices all shouting to be heard, there is the danger that the droning sound of all the yells will drown out the interesting and truly stimulating bloggers that just can't get a break.  There is more information, but perhaps less that interests the reader.  More data, but less wisdom.  More smart remarks, less biting satire.  More specialized knowledge, less well-rounded development.  But I guess we shall see.  Now, if you'll excuse me, following rules one and two (and hoping for a pass on rules three and four), I'm off to sell this post to the Commentary Mandarins.  What, you think I wouldn't take my own advice?

      ...just thought I would direct you to some of the new links from the last few days.  Give them all a look - especially  urlLink The Spence's We Three ,  urlLink bizgirl ,  urlLink Blog of a Bookslut  (get your mind out of the gutter), and  urlLink Critical Mass .  Of course, continue to look at such tried and true favorites like my  urlLink Dear Heart's page ,  urlLink Three Hell , and the ever-interesting  urlLink Open Range , among others (and soon there will be more - just so many to choose from).  Heck, just look at them all.  You know you want to.  What else are you going to do, work?  Something actually substantive, and somewhat serious, soon, true believers.  You too can see me compare blogging to Berlin.

      Inspired by the Three Hell discussion of  urlLink  Deep Impact  , I figured I'd do a little movie reviewing as well.  But, it couldn't be normal...  Some background - I did not have a TV in my apartment for about two and a half years, because (at least theoretically) I was trying to study/get dissertation done/keep from destroying my career before it begins.  But, this last birthday, my good parents ended up getting me a small television and VCR/DVD player.  I think they were getting concerned - after I answered questions like "Where would you like to eat?" in syllogisms, I think they wagered I should get away from the books.  Anyway, to test if the thing worked, ended up getting two DVDs, the Mel Brooks classic   Spaceballs   and the mockumentary   Best in Show  .  It worked, but I haven't gotten around to getting other DVDs yet, so I just keep watching these two (along with some tapes, including episodes of The Tick, the excellent   Kafka  , the freaky   Lost Highway  , etc.).  So, in any case, I keep watching  Best in Show .  Again and again and again.  So, one night, feeling bored (and after a beer or two), I decide that it is time to watch this differently.  How, you ask (or even if you didn't)?  Simple - in French.  It has one of those voice-over options, so I figured I'd see what this movie sounds like in the language of the  urlLink cheese-eating surrender monkey .  It was trippy.  I don't know if it's just the voice actors they have in the French-speaking world, or if it's just something about the language, but everyone sounds so much more.... pathos -ridden.  Even more to the point, the voices sound so much more impassioned.  The women sound more sultry, the men more masculine.  So, you have that epitome of masculinity,  urlLink Euguene Levy , saying "Mais c'est vrai. J'ai Ã©tÃ© soutenu avec deux pieds gauches," with a voice that implies this means "But it is angst.  I am haunted by the meaningless of life." Or  urlLink Parker Posey  saying in a spine-tingling way, "Beatrice avait montrÃ© des signes de dÃ©pression," where you think it means "My passions swell with the depth of my depression."  Gives the film a whole new feel.  [by the way, I'm using that great source  urlLink Babel Fish  for translations, so they are sketchy...forgive me]  But this all makes me wonder - what type of voice-overs do they have on the films we watch?  Did  urlLink Bruce Lee   really  sound like a mensch?  Or did he sound like  urlLink Woody Allen ?  These are the thoughts that keep me up at night.  That was random.  Back to work, then....

      In less than 24 hours, I shall be flying my way to Portland for a three week seminar on ethics and international relations.  While I should have computer access there, the amount of posts here may decrease.  Commence weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Or alcohol jubilation in the street - wherever the moment moves you.  But, hopefully, I will still try to have something every two days at least....this is more my therapy here, leave it alone.  Anyway, since much to do, and little time to do it, just a few random reading suggestions for today.  So, here are some books that have recently caught my attention, and wallet.  --  SHORT STORIES OF F. SCOTT FITZGERALD: A New Collection  , edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli.  I'm not terribly familiar with Fitzgerald's works - the most I ever read was   The Great Gatsby   back in high school.  I remember not terribly liking the book.  Well, I did enjoy the description of the guy who peaked too early in life, with the rest as merely a decades-long letdown - little nerd that I am thinking "Yeah, that's right, Johnny Quarterback!  Enjoy life now, for soon you will be wasting away in your bloody trailer park, telling stories of gridiron glory from twenty years ago, while life will get better for me!  VICTORY IS MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  Oddly, whenever I mention that, something about "unresolved issues" comes up.  Huh.  Anyway, it was a cheap buy at Hastings, I've been reading up more on the art of that period, so I figured I should give Fitzgerald another shot.  Besides, it seems like there are quite a few books that I couldn't stand in high school more out of youthful stupidity than anything objective.  But   The Sound and the Fury   is still a pain.  --  The Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions  , by James Turner Johnson.  This is more a dissertation/professional read for me.  While I focus more on the just war tradition in the West, this is a well-regarded comparison of what "holy war" means for Christendom and Islam (or, I guess you could say Crusade v. Jihad).  Johnson a rather respectable writer on morality in war, and it should therefore be a good read.   Well, for those of you more interested in just some web reading (i.e. something free), here are two interesting, though definitely political, articles.  One is from the inestimable VDH, talking about  urlLink defeatism  in the current conflict.  While the entire article is worthwhile, I especially enjoyed his discussion of the increasingly meaningless word "neoconservative."  He mentions that it has basically become a code-word for "Jew."  I would perhaps extend that a little bit - while the running constant in every use of the term is "supporter of the Iraq war," it seems, in most the uses of it (and most these uses reflect the ignorance of the writer than any true reality), it means "Straussian trained or influenced conservative Jew."  Lesser meanings include "conservative Jew," "Straussian trained/influenced conservative," or (as VDH points out) "Jew."  Sadly, it's not just the chattering classes that seem sucked in by this dreadful term...you'd be amazed how many academics, who supposedly should have some clue, bandy this word about against those who disagree with them.  Another is Denis Boyles's bi-weekly piece on  urlLink our dear EuroPress .  Just trippy to see some of the thoughts there on D-Day et. al.  On other (sadly, merely a quick selection from a future print issue) by Roger Scruton on the lost notion of  urlLink perversion .  All worth a read.  Yes, yes, I said I would avoid politics on this one (leaving that for the blogging on  urlLink The Open Range ), but I'm filling space here, okay?

      ....and how little productive work is done.  I keep having these horrible visions of being in grad school for another decade....but then I realize that won't happen.  My dissertation chair and Dear Heart will no doubt start cutting digits off my fingers for every month beyond a certain date.  I fully respect that - the best way to combat sloth is with good, old-fashioned fear.  Anyway, the point of that is not much to write today, though did find this interesting commentary by Matt Rosenberg on  urlLink blogs keeping stories alive  (in this case, the Bill Cosby incident at an NAACP meeting).  I rather liked these lines, though:   Admittedly, some blogs are about knitting, snow-boarding, or origami. Others are authored by navel-gazing college students, polyamorists, vegan anarchists, or self-declared alcoholics detailing each wretched night's debauch. But watch out for many of the rest.   I'm not exactly sure where this one places - perhaps in navel-gazing (hey, I'm a philosopher, it's a career choice), definitely not polyamorists (though, just by having the word "polyamorist," I may get some more hits)(so, also, CHICKS BIKINI HARDCORE XXX PARIS HILTON VIDEO AMATEUR).  Welcome, perverts.   Does your mother know you use the Internet for filth-searches?   SHAME!  SHAME!!!!!!!!!! ( urlLink bizgirl  has more on trippy uses of keywords - give her a read)  Probably no vegan anarchy stuff here either ("damn you - let the rabbits wear glasses!")(sixteen cool points for anyone who can identify that line).  So, what do we have here?  Not much - just you the true believers, and me.  All seven of you.  You are the Globe Theater to my Shakespeare, the Lyceum to my Aristotle, the VFW Hall to my Harlan Pepper.  Your patience amazes me, and I thank you.

      Over at the  urlLink Blog of a Bookslut , Ben Brown is filling in for usual blogger Jessa Crispin.  He has a nice  urlLink little post  on the sex scandal kerfuffle that recently came up [as a warning, the language is a bit rough].  But read especially the quotes - this woman sounds an awful lot like someone I used to be involved with (better known by those around me as "antichrist").  Apparently, this dreadful personality type is more common than I thought.  [sigh].  Screw it - back to reading texts by people who died 700+ years ago.

      Okay, dissertation not going well today (for those of you just joining us, I'm working on a Ph.D. in  urlLink parapsychology ), so one more, then to work.  Inspired by uber art critic Terry Teachout (and if you're not reading  urlLink About Last Night  yet, stop reading this, and go now), and his usual habit of listing what he has "consumed" artwise in the last day, I figured I would follow suit.  Sadly, this will be the philistine variety, so bear with me.  -- The current reading:  Well, with dissertation and all, the key reading has been   Summa Contra Gentiles Book II (Creation)  , by St. Thomas Aquinas.  Fascinating work, and a little easier to read than his other stuff.  Usually, I take a break for something lighter, but no time now.  -- On the CD player:     The Singles 1992-2003  , by No Doubt.  Yes, yes, it's not exactly Mozart, but I do so like Gwen Stefani's voice.  Okay, yes, I do like Gwen Stefani herself as well.  What red-blooded straight American male wouldn't?  DON'T LIE TO ME - I know you're thinking the same.  Many moons ago, I was quite fond of her.  That was before she married that British dude Gavin, and before I met my  urlLink Dear Heart  (whose name, as I have  urlLink mentioned previously , means "dear-heart-of-exceptional-mind-great-virtue-and-looks-of-Venus")(and I do know what language that is now!  It's Irish - they'll tell you her name means "within the court" or some such thing, but that definition was forced upon the Irish by the devilish  urlLink Longshanks , King Edward I.  Damn the Longshanks!  Makes me want to paint half my face blue and put on a skirt...but enough of my fantasies).  Yeah, that revealed too much.  Teachout does this better.  Back to work.

      I forgot to mention, in yesterday's post, the other downside to the tag-team double-h: while it is miserably hot in the day, you can enjoy miserable heat  and  possible tornadoes at night!  Yes, fun for all.  As I've mentioned  urlLink before , I am not a big fan of those types of storms.  The dread during those times is rather like having a legion of really paranoid people wailing around your mind - kind of like having a montage of  urlLink Edvard Munch  paintings traipsing about in your head (screaming, staring into nothing, getting all curvy and oddly-colored...a big mess, really).  At least according to the weather reports, we were supposed to have them the last two nights, but didn't really.  So, my sleeping schedule got screwed up for nothing.  But, the storms are expected tonight as well, when from sheer physical necessity I will be in happy slumber as I am blown to Oz.  So, I will report to you from the peppermint mine forced-labour camps of the Lollipop Guild tomorrow.  But, now to today.   Drama and comedy seem to require the power of three.  Leading up to a joke (so, like the Munch thing above...yeah, that was a joke; humor me here), lending pattern to build dramatic tension, etc.  But why three?  I assume someone has written on this, but hey, I can't think of anything else to write today, so here goes.  I wager the simplest explanation is that doing two things of the same or similar action helps set the general "feel" of action before the third move enters in something new (again, either dramatic or comedic).  But, I am a political philosopher.  We cannot leave the question so simply answered.  Get meta with me.  If I were a better theologian, I would no doubt locate this tri-centrality to the inherent notion of Trinity in God's creation.  My head's Hegelian, who ranks up there with my cranium's Kantian for "conversations most likely to cure insomnia," sees this as reflecting the move towards  aufheben : the first two moves as separate entities in contradiction to one another (the one standing on its own, the other as following in pattern, and yet against one another's core defining point because of the necessary relationship to the other), moving into dialectical relation (understanding the core point) onto the third move of dramatic/comedic transcendence.  Meanwhile, frat-guy-who-never-was thinks this relationship reflects....well, he doesn't really.  Fat, drunk, and stupid is  the  way to go through life for him.  The point of all this?  No point.  Just came to mind in the shower, and wanted to write it down.   What are you doing?  Stop emailing the Lollipop Guild.  No, you shouldn't send them "motivational suggestions."  Holy jeez...no....don't do that....don't tell them to use the spice drop batons!!!!  They  BURN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       The Texas sun beats down upon me like the devil's smile...  -- urlLink  New Orleans  , by Cowboy Mouth.   Sometimes, when a fellow falls in love, he thinks he's walking on air.  But then there is east Texas, where just moving means swimming through air.  Heat is one thing.  Humidity another.  When they combine together, it is a tag-team matchup sure to bring misery wherever it goes.  And the tag-team has a tour of the state that lasts from about April until September....and it just doesn't stop.  You wake up in the morning, dreading the prospect of heading out again.  But you know you must.  It is the sort-of dread one faces, I wager, before a great battle, or death.  You go through the motions of normal existence, realizing its futility against what is about to happen.  You take a shower....but you know it is irrelevant.  For then you walk out the door....where it is a healthy 97 degrees outside, with humidity of 93%.  Within three minutes, you are drenched in sweat.  Between your flesh and your shirt is an environment not unlike the Amazon.  That is fitting, as it seems every bird-eating insect from that region is in town, and wants to get to the "home away from home" in your wardrobe-enclosed biosphere.  So, you drive to the office.  The car's air-conditioner gives up the ghost in the first two minutes, and you wish you could join it.  You feel pounds sweating off of you....knowing that only the first few were good pounds to lose, the rest being the dying of internal organs.  Everyone seems to drive slower, letting you cook in your own blood all the better.  You desire water.  You desire rest.  You desire the dread fireball in the sky to plunge into the sea.  The unbearable hotness of being begins to crack your psyche.  Things seem as they are not: the roads wave like the ocean, the air is too bright with oranges and reds, the mushroom-people keep asking you for change  and won't go away ...waitaminute...sorry, wrong delusions (bloody acid flashbacks).  After spending forty years in the humid wilderness (or at least, so it feels), you finally arrive at the office.  You open the door, and behold!  An arctic jet of chilled air engulfs you!  Sweet ecstasy of cold!  Well, almost....unfortunately, it can be a bit of a shock on the system to go from Brazilian wilderness to Norwegian fjord.  But, that's okay - after they get the defibulator out and re-start your heart, all is well.  Until you go out, and face the dread tag-team, Double-H, once again.    Yes, as the above shows, the heat has attacked my brain.  My apologies.  But, it seems like everybody has been having fun with weather - at least there is no  urlLink permacloud  here.

      Well, things have been a little off today (up waaaaaaay too late last night thanks to some nasty storms, paying the rent today, etc.), but here is what to expect in the next six-seven hours.  --If I can find the link, one of the funniest commencement speeches of current times. --How Texas heat and humidity can bring a rational human being towards self-strangulation. --Over at  urlLink The Open Range , probably some chit-chat about stupid defense tricks (and possibly a rebuttal of a pagan, whoohoo!).  Be sure to swing by there anyway - Dave (a.k.a. Blade-of-Federalists'-Sword) always has interesting commentary, and just put up something else today. --Dunno...maybe something else.  If you couldn't tell, I'm having a hard time getting motivated today.  Such is life.  Well, there  is  one other thing - if any of you are desperate, I could rant on and on about ontology in the just war tradition, past and present.  Or, I could just take pliers to your toenails.

      As I was working, I realized that I had to go through an online training course about discrimination in the workplace and so forth.  It involves going through some material talking about how the laws are oh-so-good, then taking a test to prove that you will march in lockstep I MEAN follow procedures to allow for a more inclusive and caring employment community.  While there were many elements of it I could rant on, part of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) got me the most.  Under the law, employers need to modify the facilities in order to assist the disabled employee work.  Fair enough.  But, it mentioned that if anyone should ask, say, why the filing cabinets are half-sized, all you can say  under threat of legal action  is that it's for "legitimate business purposes" or "to be in accordance with federal law."  Yeah, that's right - do as the law says AND don't say specifically why you're doing it.  What are the words I'm looking for?  Oh, right:   WAR IS PEACE   FREEDOM IS SLAVERY   IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH   Forgive me, but this is where the libertarian-dying-to-get-out-of-my-head takes umbrage.  What, do they think the employees are too stupid to put two-and-two together?  "Huh, the boss is starting to get smaller filing cabinets.  Could it have to do with Stan getting stuck in that wheelchair recently?  Naaaaaah, couldn't be!  Boss said 'legitimate business purposes.'  And he is a legitimate businessman....oh hell, they must be easier to bury bodies in!  I work for Vito Corleone and didn't realize it!"  Please.  The sexual harassment one could use some work too.  While generally giving as examples the most obvious types of things (the "gimme sex for a raise" and "hey baby, let me tell you about my sexual adventures" sorts), the  verboten  acts include "hugging."  I'm not a terribly touchy-feely guy, but I wager I've done a good share of hugging since I've gotten here.  Who knew I was committing so many federal offences?  The point?  No point.  Wanted to vented.  Back to work.

      Yesterday, the professor in charge of the seminar I'm taking suggested a big game of ultimate frisbee.  Foolishly, I decided to join in.  Pain follows.  For those unfamiliar with ultimate frisbee, it is a game that attracts potheads and granola types the world over.  Anyone at a major state university has no doubt witnessed it, as well as its....often unique players.  After all, where else can you see guys who look like their childhood idol was  urlLink Shaggy  playing against women just back from a "Save the Spotted Seal Pondjumper!" rally?  Anyway, it follows some of the same rules as soccer, but with a frisbee instead.  No running with said disc, only tossing to team-mates.  (For those terribly interested, or avoiding work, look  urlLink here ).  So, anyway, we start playing, teams of four-on-four.  I was told to guard the professor.  I figured, "Hey, this guy has probably at least ten years on me - I haven't exercised much, but I can do this, no problem."  Yeah.  On the bright side, if we could ever tap into this man's internal power resources, the energy crisis of the United States, if not the world, will be solved.  So, we run....we throw....we run more....and run more....and more....all the sudden, my lungs start speaking to me.  It translates to "You know, this wasn't a terribly wise idea.  Perhaps you should consider stopping for a bit."  In the original lungese, it is something to the persuasion of " GAAAASSSSPP!!!!!!!!   Huheee  huheeee  huheee ...."  So, I lay on the ground, as I lay dying, hoping that the nearby tree will uproot and end my misery, we begin again.  So, today's lesson, true believers?  Don't believe that nonsense about the new information era making life easier - because there will always always be that academic who wants to ball.

      Can't write long (time for dinner), but the seminar stuff is going well, and is interesting.  But I have to admit, if anyone should know anything about postcolonial studies or Levinas (whoeverthehell he is), please please leave a comment/email to tell me about them.  I am running the risk of being the stupid kid in class, and nobody wants that.  Okay,  I  don't want that.  Portland is quite beautiful, and today we took a field trip to a place called  urlLink Multnomah Falls , which is about 620 feet tall.  It was cold, wet, and absolutely lovely.  Nothing like river water after a mile long walk uphill to cool you down.  Well, that was all random.  I still live.  Jimmy Hoffa, Kurt Cobain, Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G., and Falco do not.  There will be updates as soon as new information becomes available.

      Greetings, true believers, from the land of rain and moistness!  I have arrived safe and sound, and looks like things are going to be groovy here.  Can't write much - just letting you know I'm alive.  Stop looking so disappointed!  Jeez, I wonder about you people sometimes...

      Yeah, that's as hip as I get.  Whaddaya expect from me?  In any case, I'm just getting ready to head to bed - I have been working on presentation part II (more about that later), where I can offer a rebuttal...which, given that my project needs a lot of work, will probably be hereafter known as the "not-in-the-face!!!" discussion.  But, before heading out, I did want to direct you all to one of the new sites on the links collection -  urlLink Do Thy Research .  Rockin' commentary and good fun from someone (a grad student like myself,  urlLink Dear Heart , our  urlLink conspiracy guy , and others) who knows pain.  She also had a rather  urlLink nice write-up  for this site:   To start off, I found Shades of Gray (Umbrae Canarum) in one of the nicest ways possible, via Sitemeter. I've finally been linked to in someone's sidebar. Hooray! I have enjoyed reading Umbrae Canarum (I assume that means "Shades of Gray" in Latin, but since I neither know Latin nor own a Latin lexicon, your guess is as good as mine) for the last few days, as well as its random references to 1984, the fall of the Byzantine Empire, and various theologians.   We have a write-up!!!!!!!!  And it's  positive!!!!!!   Yes, true believers, life is groovy.  And, in answer to the mention, yes, "umbrae canarum" is my plebian attempt of writing "shades of gray" in Latin (although I think it may basically just mean "gray shades" if translated right, hey, this is a blog, whaddaya expect????).

      Was going to thrill you all with amazing stories, dry wit, humor and horror, but alas, nothing to report.  Probably the most horrifying thing was two-fold - we brought David Lynch's classic   Blue Velvet   to the basement of the dorm two days ago.  That was fine.  However, it starts getting, well....uncomfortable when you have a very nice older lady in the room with you (Dennis Hopper's character has a tendency to use the "f" word as an adjective, adverb, noun, verb, trope, and preposition in his sentences.  Sometimes in the  same  sentences).  That was less than swell.  Then the DVD went wiggy about 15-20 minutes from the end.  For those of you only familiar with Lynch via   Lost Highway  ,  Blue Velvet  actually has some type of linear plot, so missing the end was quite the buzz-kill.  But, that wasn't what I planned on writing about.  I have a song stuck in my head.  It is from Grant Lee Buffalo, off the   Mighty Joe Moon   album.  So, discuss among yourselves what is the deeper meaning (if any) within this short song (this will be on the final exam):   In the last days of Tecumseh, there in the end There were rumors of invasion, even talk of space men But he couldn't believe all that he knew would fade In the ground below the airplanes Tecumseh were laid.

      Well, this is a bit later than anticipated, but so it goes - thanks to  urlLink the teaching assistant  for the vote on the topic for today.  But, will probably do the others soon, too (by the way, David Lynch is a director famous for his....well, some would call them "interesting," others "disturbing," many both, films.  They include  urlLink  Eraserhead  ,  urlLink  Dune  ,  urlLink  Blue Velvet  ,  urlLink  Wild at Heart  ,  urlLink  Twin Peaks  , and  urlLink  Lost Highway  , among others...).  There are a few more books than usual to consider, since, while in Portland, I visited the grand-daddy of used book stores, Powell's.  Much joy, followed by much poverty, happened that trip.  But, without further ado, here are some books that have caught my attention...and wallet.  -- urlLink  The Road to Serfdom  , by F. A. Hayek.  Loved by libertarians and free market fetishists the world over, this lovely little volume discusses the dangers of collectivism versus individualism.  Famously dedicated "To Socialists of All Parties," Hayek makes the case that individual changes and adapting to circumstances in the end creates more wealth and freedom than the collectivist option.  While he makes some pretty good points, you can definitely see that his expertise is in economics (it's a trippy thing to see an idol of some libertarians advocating a federal world government, as Hayek does in his second to last chapter).  Worth a shot - always interesting.  -- urlLink  The Conservative Mind  , by Russell Kirk.  Yes, there is a reason why these two are on the list - I plan on doing an academic journal article on conservative political thought some time after getting the PhD, so getting the material now.  Anyway, this book is credited for causing Hayek to give his "Why I am Not a Conservative" speech - Kirk is arguing from a different angle, specifically giving a history of Burke-inspired (or -influenced) conservatism from Burke to Eliot.  What has helped in reading it thus far is Kirk's writing style - he has a knack for broad phrases, poetry, and setting (it should be noted that, among other things, Kirk wrote various novels and ghost stories).  Should be quite interesting.  --But, moving away from politics, now to the realm of "SCIENCE!!!" (quick test - I bet you were raised in the 1980s if "She Blinded Me With Science" gets stuck in your head after seeing "science" with an exclamation point).  But, for we plebs who had to beg and plead to just pass basic chemistry, this is a different type of science reading.   urlLink  The Road Since Structure   is a collection of articles written by MIT brainiac Thomas S. Kuhn, author of the paradigm-shifting book  urlLink  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  , which introduced the idea of a scientific "paradigm" and "normal research" and the like, as well as the term "paradigm-shift."  So, be thankful.  Yes, you.  Anyway,  Road  is a collection of some of his articles following the publication of  Structure , attempting to clarify his views, while answering some of his critics.  For philosophy of science geeks, this is uber-nifty.  --And for those with an interest for the weird, I suggest  urlLink  A Life of Jung  , by Ronald Hayman.  I must admit a personal interest in Prof. Jung - back in high school, we had one of those "Meeting of the Minds" things we had to do for class.  I wanted to be  urlLink Eliot Ness , but he was not enough of a mind for the thing (a few years later, some other student was that world-changing mental giant Jackie O. - not that I'm bitter or anything), so I ended up by chance picking one of the founders of modern psychology, Carl Gustav Jung.  While he was about with Freud for a time, they (as I understand it) rather had a falling out.  Words like "collective unconscious," "archetypes," and the like attach to Jung's name, a fellow also considered somewhat of a mystic (if not other things as well).  I've only read through a few of the first chapters in this book, and well.....let me put it this way, if little Carl was about these days, we would say he was a child with "issues."  Jung was one seriously screwed up little kid (he would have his two "personalities," numbered One and Two; dreams that go from bizarre to blasphemous, etc.).  How long this stays with him, I don't know.  But it is a little unnerving to realize that some of the big minds in psychology's founding were, well, in serious need of some therapy themselves (don't even get me started on Freud convincing a generation of scholars that they all wanted to sleep with dear ol' mom when they were three....oy).  But, looks like it could be an interesting look into the mind of someone who spent his time looking into the mind.  --For those of you still reading (all two of you), a quick question.  I've had this line stuck in my head, and I cannot recall who said it or when (though I wager it was either during the Mexican War or the Civil War).  It goes as follows (though note - it would be best to read it out loud, preferably with your best rendition of a South'n accen', as it will get the full effect): "And there stands Jackson, like a stone wall.  Let us vow to die here together then, and with it, gain victory."  As I should be dissertating, I haven't the time to look for it right now.  If anyone happens to be a nineteenth century US military history buff (or even one wearing a robe - I'm easy-going), please let me know who and where.  Thanks!  --Huh.  I know I wanted to mention at least one more book.  But which one escapes me.  Ah!  I know - try the  urlLink  Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies  , by Bartolome de Las Casas.  Bishop Las Casas was an interesting man - serving in Chiapas during the first decades of the Spanish conquest of the New World, he unfailingly argued for the rights and dignity of the native peoples.  My first run in with him was his strongest defense,  urlLink  In Defense of the Indians  , an extended argument/discussion/polemic on the issues at the time.  As I understand it, Short Account is an abbreviated version of a history he did, with the purpose of illustrating to the King of Spain the horrors going on across the sea.  While Las Casas has been co-opted by many (and, admittedly, I'm focusing on him for a chapter of my just war dissertation), he is still a fascinating man, and an interesting (if difficult) read.   Well, time to dissertate again.  Who knows?  I might actually get done in....oh, five or six years at this rate.   sigh

      Well, it appears I have managed to whittle down the true believers to about four now - I thank you for your high level of endurance.  I have now returned to the Free Republic of Texas, for the moment, and will write up some more soon.  So yes, I live.  Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan and Ray Charles do not.  Very sad, that.  But, in any case, I will have some stuff up later today - as I am working on the dissertation, I will no doubt need distraction at some point.  It will either be on David Lynch as conservative (there's actually a book about that)(yes, be afraid), being an alien in academia, or a random "books I dig" entry.  Soooooooo  YOU  now have the power to decide, all four of you.  If you see this before the next message, let me know what you would like to see, and I will write on it.  If not, you leave me to my own devices.     And no one wants that.

      ...and I'm watching every one of you.  Yes, that means you too - I know what you've been up to.  Shame!   Shame!!!!!   Okay, enough of that.  Just as a quick update - regular posts will begin again soon.  Things have been busy yet productive here, thus keeping me away.  And things may be sparse at the end of the month as well, since I'm visiting  urlLink Dear Heart  at grand ol' ND.  These are all good things.  On the bad side, the cafeteria here is trying to poison us.  You think I jest (or, you are secretly hoping it's true....you scare me), but it is so.  We've had three people come down with what we suspect is food poisoning in the last two days, and on my blackberries, I found a substance still not quite identified (either it was brown sugar that had managed to come from God knows where, or we had some moss to give the berries flavor).  So, I will give you a full report on the fun of stomach-pumping procedures should it arise.  And if not, I will have something more interesting soon - check out the links, for they are rockin'.    You're still reading this.   Why?   There are other links there.   Help a brother out - give'em a look.   I'll stop now.      Okay, now I'll stop.

      You can tell quite a bit about a person from his/her aspirations, from when one can say, "I have 'made it'."  For some, it's making that first million.  For others, retiring at 35.  For others, becoming the top of their field, or reaching tenure, or some such.  And others, becoming President of the United States (or iron-fisted dictator of a third-world nation of choice).  None of these are my goals.  No, I can tell I've 'made it' when I finally have a washer and dryer within my home.  A low goal, admittedly, but a reasonable one.  And besides, there are many horrors when the laundry machines are far away.  We have already seen the madness of facing off with Gargantuan the Ugly, the palmetto bug who is master of all he surveys, but now there is another.  And he is even more insidious, as his species seems so....weak.  Some background.  Whether it is the heat, the time of year, or the humidity in Texas, some of the birds have been getting rather aggressive.  At first, I chalked it up to the mating season (nature's little version of "Ladies' Night" at the local frat bar), since the birds kept attacking one another.  But there was one, one who seemed especially ticked off at the world and all that lives within it.  And his name....is Squinty.  Squinty is a small bird - I don't know what kind of the top of my head (hey, I could barely pass plant biology - you expect me to know vertebrates?).  He's a gray bird, with a white line along the tips of his wings when they are spread, and with a white belly.  To look at him, you would think, "A stronger-than-slight breeze would knock this sucker down."  But not Squinty.  Not the Conqueror.  Squinty has sectioned off parts of the apartment complex as his own.  Whether it is other birds of his kind, larger birds (such as the dreadful grackle), certain furry mammals, what have you - he will fight them all, and succeed.  I thought he was happy attacking the avian or four-legged interlopers on his domain.  How wrong I was.  So, I walk to the laundromat thingamajig in the complex, detergent in one hand, and a freakin' huge bag of laundry swung over my back (I'm a bachelor, you expect me to do these things before it's absolutely necessary?).  I'm minding my own business.  I don't want trouble.  Then I see Squinty.  And the Conqueror  certainly  sees me.  Flying straight at me like a  Wehrmacht  fighter, Squinty, letting out the battle-cry of his kind (a type of bleem-filled "CcccccchhhiiiiiiiIIIIRRRPP!!!!!!!!!"), aims for my heart with his beak.  I dodge, letting out the defensive response of my kind ("WHOA!!!!!!").  I wager he just didn't notice me.  But no, he flies around again.  Swinging my laundry, I try to throw the Conqueror off, and it works, for a moment.  Swerving away from the bag, Squinty ascends to a roof, chirping away, which would roughly translate to, "That's right, b****!  You walk on, you @%$#@%!!  Nobody walks through MY territory!"  And I walk on to the laundromat.  And take another way out.  I decide that facing off with Squinty again is not worthwhile (heck, even Gargantuan was gone - Squinty seems to have scared him away).  And so, one path to the laundry is "Squinty-turf."  A pity.  The point of all this?  What, you've been reading this blog and you think there's a  point???   There's no Santa Claus either.  Sorry about that.  But one point - I will be opening a trust fund for a washer/dryer in the near future.  It will be tax-deductible, and we thank you for your support.

      As you can tell from the time, I'm writing a  wee  bit earlier than normal today.  My flight for the mystical realm of Notre Dame leaves at about 7:50 from Houston, so had to wake up early.  Also forgot some rather important things (like directions to the airport, directions to the specific place I'm staying, etc.), so had to wake up even earlier.  Yeah, this is going to be a fun drive to Houston - I haven't driven there enough to "do it in my sleep," but I may end up doing that today anyway.  So, if things don't go well, I will report to you next from the ICU wing of one of Texas's fine hospitals, but if all is fine, will have more soon from righteous Indiana.  As a side-note, just wanted to express thanks and happiness - Umbrae Canarum has passed the 1000 site-visits mark.   YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAW!!!!!!!!!   Yes, I am pleased.  Thank you all for your tolerance, or twisted desire for pain.  Either works.  But, a thing to look forward to - once again, the laundry has put me in contact with another vicious member of nature.  We have seen  urlLink Gargantuan the Ugly .  Prepare to meet....Squinty the Conqueror.  A nail-biter to the end, I assure you.  Stay tuned, true believers.

      For those who haven't read it yet, give this  urlLink little fisking piece  by James Lileks a look.  In it, he takes to task our favorite agitprop director, Michael Moore.  But reading it put me into a daydream, a fantasy you might say.  One that has come many times before.  A dream of a wonderful event, were propaganda will fight propaganda the right way - with fists.  Yes, that's right - I dream of the day when we can have a steel-cage match, no rules, with spike-tipped gloves, involving great amounts of betting.  Our competitors?  In ten rounds, a magnificent fight, with  urlLink Michael Moore  in one corner, and  urlLink Ann Coulter  in the other.  Imagine the sales!  Imagine the thrill.  To quote the Prime Minister of boxing,  urlLink Don King , "ONLY in America, my friend!"  I'll be putting my five dollars on Ann, myself.  Not because I'm conservative, but because she's feisty, and...well, I wager she fights dirty.

He's looking for some advice on what to chat about, so drop him a line.  He is now on the permanent link list, and life is well.  Me, I'd give him some pointers, but as the true believers know, my writing seems more dictated by  urlLink caffeine consumption  than by any real thought.  More later - stay tuned, true believers.

      I need some helpful advice from the blogosphere.  I am in desperate need of a hobby.   urlLink The good Courtney  has mentioned that I am one of the few folks she knows without one, and as I was thinking of it, that applies with the people I know too.  This is problematic.  This must change.  But what hobby to pick?  I was thinking of joining one of the clubs here, but uncertain which.  There are two requirements, though: first, it should not be something too simple, and second, nothing too dull.  So, yes, stamp-collecting is out.  But what?   What?!?!?!?!?!?   An initial thought was the ancient art of  urlLink kendo , the Japanese art of sword-fighting.  It would be a good way of expanding my cultural horizons, and besides, what all-American kid raised on B-movie samurai flicks  wouldn't  want to do Far East swash-buckling?  But I don't know how good the club in town is, so that becomes a problem.  I had thought about boxing.  But, since my career is going to involve a great deal of thinking, I probably do not want to end up like Rocky Balboa.  Hey, I've spent over 20 years getting my brain in shape - if that's gone, I don't exactly have brawn or looks to get me through.  So, thought maybe about painting.  I have no real experience with it, so it would be challenging.  But is there the natural talent?  While I would like to have the skill to paint like a  urlLink Hopper  or  urlLink Rossetti , very realistic and true to the human form, thus far most my drawings of humans have a closer resemblance to  urlLink Jabba the Hutt .  But, that's a possibility.  But artists can have....well, an odd streak.  If you weren't aware of that, welcome to the planet Earth, please enjoy your stay.  But more to the point, I didn't realize how typical this sort of thing was.  Whether it's  urlLink Tamara de Lempicka  or  urlLink Egon Schiele  being ghastly to their respective families (apparently artistic freedom forgives enslaving those around you), or the general problems with reality of  urlLink James Ensor , or the hideous political agendas of some artists, like the bloody Stalinism of  urlLink Frida Kahlo  and  urlLink Diego Rivera , artists seem to have issues.  And that doesn't even cover their....general laxity with marriage vows and the like.  Huh....maybe I should go into painting.  Be the first bohemian conservative of the next century!  Yeehaw!!!!!!!!!!!  But, that would require energy.  And probably talent.  Well, must keep thinking....any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

      For those of you with some time, or just want to avoid work, give this little aesthetic test a try.  TCCI = Teachout Cultural Concurrence Index, a listing of A or B questions that show how much your tastes are along the same lines as critic extraordinaire Terry Teachout.  Teachout, who does criticism for the  urlLink Wall Street Journal  and  urlLink  Commentary   (among other places), is also the author of   The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken   (an interesting book on a unique man - I'm about halfway through it now), and of course, the rockin' blogger at  urlLink About Last Night  (along with the anonymous Our Girl in Chicago, OGIC).  Give it a try, give him a read.  I will hopefully have my own score up in the near future (i.e. by next week).

      Yeah, yeah, I know....I said yesterday that I was going to write something happier, but this isn't as negative as the title sounds.  We've talked politics recently and all, so figured throw a little theology/philosophy in.  It's what's on my mind, and besides, I needed a little something different before starting on  Aquinas  again (yes, I know it's the same book that I have been reading....it's been going slow, what can I say?).  To the point.  While the question of evil is one that has hassled me for years, this angle came to mind thinking about  urlLink David Lynch  (mentioned here before).  Writer/director of many a different film (some mentioned  urlLink here ), probably most popularly known for his TV series  Twin Peaks , Lynch has an...odd view of life, which I wager anyone who has seen his work would agree.  What especially got my mind on the topic was something a friend of mine in Portland - we'll call him Paleface here - mentioned to me.  Some of his buddies and he were talking about the director, and about a  book  that came out about him.  Specifically, it argued that Lynch was a type of conservative (or, as the book description puts it: "Filmmaker David Lynch's work is viewed here as patriotic and Puritanical. This Lynch is an idealistic conservative on a reformer's mission. Lynch promotes a return to the values inherent in a mythological America, but he indulges in a voyeuristic pleasure which he simultaneously condemns").  For those unaware of his films, this claim is not intuitively obvious.  Lynch's films are done in a rather untraditional way, with often disturbing portrayals of sex, violence, sex-and-violence, and sheer weirdness to boot.  I haven't read the book, but it may have a point, if I may be so tactless as to argue about a book I've never laid eyes on (as a warning, some spoilers coming).  One thing that Paleface and his friends mentioned was the utter unattractiveness of the villains in Lynch's work.  While in   Dune  , this is understandable (Frank Herbert wrote the Baron Harkonnen as such a vile person, there was no real question of liking him or not), even in Lynch's own works, this is clear.  Guys like Frank Booth (from   Blue Velvet  ), Mr. Eddie and the Robert Blake character (from   Lost Highway  ), and others, may all be memorable, they may be unique, but they certainly are not complex, maybe good/maybe bad fellows.  Sure, Booth may love Dorothy in weird way (as Lynch mentioned in an interview), but given that, he is still a violent and vulgar fellow, still a "sick and dangerous man" (as the character Jeffrey puts it).  No anti-heroes, no felons looking for redemption...there are the good and the bad.  The bad remain so.  The good run the risk of falling into evil.  But there is another angle - to listen to Lynch, he has a strong focus on the dichotomy of light vs. darkness.  So, in  Blue Velvet , there is the light that one sees in the character of Sandy, the light mixed with curiosity of darkness in Jeffrey, the damaged and corrupted nature of Dorothy, the utterly dark Frank.  But consider two other works, namely  Twin Peaks  and  Lost Highway  - this mix is appropriate as, in an  urlLink interview  [scroll down], Lynch "confessed that Lost Highway and Twin Peaks take place in the same world."  One element of  Twin Peaks  concerns two lodges, the Black Lodge and the White Lodge (I'm working from conversations with Paleface here, as I've never seen the series, so please correct me if I misremember our chat).  When in the lodges, the floor is checkered, on for eternity it seems.  There is good, and there is evil, and the two seem inseparably entwined.  Even the old man and the short freaky fellow both come from the same source.  The good spirits seem impotent, the evil ones more active.  This notion of light and darkness seems to reveal certain dualistic tendencies in Lynch, as in dualist religions (best source on this - Stoyanov's   The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy  ).  Basically, there is the idea that there is not one God, but rather two, or Two Principles, one of light (good), the other of darkness (evil).  While it depends on the sect, in some, the two exist eternally - there are always both, never just one or the other.  The heresy that St. Augustine belonged to, the Manichaeans, was of this type (in the Gnostic variety).  Lynch, in this way, seems to have a rather dualistic view himself.  And he perhaps falls into the same trap.  One thing St. Augustine pointed out was that the Two Principles notion, as often conceived, shows a passive light against an active darkness.  Following the logic, in the end, the Evil Principle will win.  Or, in the immortal words of  Dark Helmet , "Evil will always triumph, because good is dumb."  This leads us to  Lost Highway .  Ask yourself - who  is  the good guy in this film?  In  Blue Velvet  or  Twin Peaks , or heck even   Eraserhead  , you could see who was in the light versus the darkness.  Is there really anyone in this position in  Lost Highway ?  Certainly not Fred Madison, not Mr. Eddie.  Perhaps Pete Dayton, before we see him (as the someone curious of darkness, but light), and yet that seems unlikely.  Renee/Alice?  Perhaps Renee, but is she Alice too?  Indeed, it seems that the only good characters are bit players - Arnie, the cops, or Pete's parents as possibilities.  If  Lost Highway  and  Twin Peaks  are the same world, it looks like the darkness is winning.  Why this long discussion on movies?  Because it might illustrate something about why evil is problematic in most folks' minds.  After all, even St. Augustine (as he tells us in his   Confessions  ) suffered quite some time in trying to understand why there is evil.  And in the current age, perhaps we need a reminder of his solution.  Why is evil problematic?  Because, in general experience, it seems more active than good.  Consider this yourself - what are you more likely to remember, a good done to you, or an evil act against you?  For most, the unfortunate answer will probably be the latter.  Moreover, turn on the news on any given day - what will you see more of?  Stories of good, or of evil?  That one is obvious.  What names are generally remembered best in history?  The great saints?  Or the great sinners?  Or, perhaps better, which category could you fill with more names?  But this is all perception.  Is evil really more active than good?  Following the dualists, whether of the ancient or of the Lynch variety, the answer, inevitably, must be yes.  If there is a light principle and a dark principle, the light is dumb, and the dark is rampant.  But that is the incorrect way of looking at the matter.  One of the great gifts St. Augustine gave theology and philosophy, to be made even better by St. Thomas Aquinas (yes, I'm letting my  Gilson  show here, back off), is the notion that existence itself is good.  That a thing is good insofar as it  is .  Evil is only a decay of good - evil is, quite literally, nothingness.  Or, in other words, good can be without evil, but evil is parasitically dependent on good to have any existence at all.  There are no two principles, but only one, the good/light/God, and then there is decay in those things that are not eternal, immutable, unmoved.  But, now to the issue at hand.  What about evil?  It has no nature of itself, really, so how can it be active?  Perhaps the perception can assist us here.  As noted above, evil seems more obvious, more typical, more to the mind.  But that, I wager, is a result of being used to what is given, what already is about.  Both St. Augustine and St. Thomas mention that the creation of the world, the actual creation of any-thing, is more stunning and more miraculous than the miracles usually seen or demanded.  What is God's parting of the sea compared to His making of the universe?  But we are used to the universe, but not to seas parting.  We are just too accustomed to what is to understand how great indeed it is.  The same, by analogy, could be said of evil.  Why does evil appear the more active?  Simply because we are used to what  is , and the destruction of what  is  comes as more of a hit to our perception than the preservation of what  is  will.  For all our talk of creating, humanity cannot create in the true sense - nothing we do comes  ex nihilo .  Thanks to pride, this is intolerable to humanity.  So, by attempting self-deification, one can do two things: attempt to create things  ex nihilo  (an impossibility), or restart from the ground up.  In other words, destroy.  Whether a revolutionary, an imperialist general, a mobster or a gossip, evil is followed because it is possible.  That is why evil, a natureless thing, appears more active.  It is more active because it is something different - it is a move to nonexistence.  But the agent bringing nonexistence is like a snake eating its tail - sooner or later, the actor ceases to be as well, and his particular march of evil ends.  In the end, not only will good/light win, it is an impossibility that it can be defeated.  Maybe I've read Lynch wrong.  I hope so.  A dualist view is necessarily a pessimistic one, if the believer really takes his beliefs seriously.  Wow, this has been a long post.  And not even a funny one.  Can't promise happy tomorrow, but I will show you the funny or your money back.  So, once you pay me, then you can get paid back.

      Well, I just wrote that title, so obviously I must think of something happy.  But what?  What??????  Perhaps, if I go to my happy place, something will come up (jeez, I sound like freakin' Mr. Rogers here).  Anyway, here we go......to a place with the wide blue sky, and a river nearby, where the sun shines brightly, and a cool breeze caresses my face.  The trees and grass are green, and the insects have all split the country.  And there I walk, barefoot, with the love of my life walking with me, one of my hands holding hers, the other holding my completed dissertation.... aaaaaaaah .  Waitaminute.  Why is it getting humid here?  Where did those clouds come from?  Huh....there's something in the distance.....no, it can't be.  It is!  It's the dread publishorperish tornado!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How the hell did that get here????  Go back to the neurotic place, ya damnable thing!!!  No....NO.....   AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!     That didn't work.  Curses.  On a better note, had the first lecture today.  On the bright side, it was short.  On the not so nifty side, it looks as if it will be standing-room only.  This ought to be interesting.  Even less nifty, it looks like the university bookstore (or, as a priest I used to know called them, "robber-barons") does not have enough books for everyone.  Swell.  Nothing happy yet.  Must be to hot and humid (hey, you wear a navy three-piece suit in 92 degree, 100 degree heat index, weather, and see how happygolucky  you  are).   All right.  Start again tomorrow, true believers.  See y'all then.

      So don't say you weren't warned.  I was taking a quick look at  urlLink  The Nation   online when I ran into this charming little  urlLink article , entitled "'The Birthday of the World,'" off "The Online Beat" by John Nichols.  It's a type of Happy July Fourth style thing, and yet....it could use some work.  Here is the first paragraph:   "The Patriot Act, sweeping as it is, does not ban every expression of radicalism. On at least one day each year, Americans still celebrate revolution."   Ooooooookay.  I  urlLink have   urlLink mentioned   urlLink elsewhere , mostly over at  urlLink The Open Range , the level of paranoia about the administration (and especially John Ashcroft) is stunning.  It would be funny if not oh-so-sad.  Could anyone inform me what sundry forms of radicalism have been banned by the Patriot Act?  After all, there have been mass protests in this country from such happy-go-lucky groups as ANSWER, MoveOn.org (to the best of my knowledge) has not been closed down, billionaire George Soros can make it his mission in life (and wallet) to see Bush defeated in the election, and the jack-booted thugs of the state have yet to incarcerate Michael Moore (a man large enough both in ego and sheer tonnage to throw small planetoids out of orbit) for his little agitprop film.  Yes, no doubt the Patriot Act will put a damper on some forms of radicalism - al'Qeada and the folks at the  urlLink Weather Underground  would find the Act somewhat restrictive.  Oh, yes....no blowing up of buildings or robbing of banks.  God save the Union from such vicious oppression of radicalism!  Next paragraph.   "Indeed, so long as no one tells John Ashcroft or Dick Cheney that the Fourth of July honors revolutionaries who threw off the chains of colonialism, empire, monarchy and the state-sponsored religion that were - and remain - the primary threats to freedom and human advancement, the holiday is probably safe from interference from our contemporary King George and his churlish courtiers."   No offense to Nichols, but I wager that Ashcroft and Cheney are much more knowledgeable of the Founding than he.  But, let's humor him for a minute, shall we?  I guess I should be pleased - to see  The Nation  actually  praising  the Founding Fathers is perhaps a step in the right direction.  The Founding Fathers have taken a rather unpleasant beating from  The Nation 's side of the aisle this last century, after all.  Whether it is Beard's  view  that the Founders were a plutocratic group of property-owners, caring only to ensure their economic hegemony, to the more recent focus on the Founders as  hypocritical   slave-owners , to see someone in  The Nation  saying nice things about them is refreshing.  Doubt it will last.  And indeed, it doesn't.  Who is the major focus on in this piece?  Why, our favorite radical, Tom Paine (and a pain he often was).  As a historical note, while Paine's  Common Sense  was rather popular during the American War for Independence (I have a hard time calling it the "Revolutionary War"), he fell rather out of favor soon afterwards.  He was quite radical, and it didn't tend to suit the population's sensibilities.  He rather liked the French Revolution...and that was  such  a stunning success, wasn't it?  If that's the type of radicalism Nichols wants, he's welcome to it.  Me, I prefer to avoid reigns of terror and short generals with delusions of grandeur, myself.  But more to the specifics of the paragraph, who knew that the Spirit of 1776 was the great cause of anti-imperialism?  The rights of Englishmen, natural law, Enlightenment rationalism, Edwards-inspired Calvinism, and all the sundry other influences in the time were apparently no nevermind.  The US was populated by post-colonialists.  Who knew?  And we are safe from our "contemporary King George."  Huh.  For a guy apparently living at the onset of American totalitarianism, he seems awfully confident that his insults and slights won't make him "disappear."  And as well as he should - he won't.  For as much as he and his ilk would love to speak truth to power, and be the great martyrs against the rise of home-grown fascism, it just ain't happenin' here.  Not that the language of abuse has changed much - Jonah Goldberg recently gave  urlLink a nice reminder  of how the "conservative as fascist/Nazi/kitten-skinner" line is rather popular.  So, true believers, enlighten me - if John Ashcroft were really the American Goebbels so much of the chattering class  wants  him to be, do you think half this inflammatory talk would go without serious repercussions?  Of course not.  Because this is not a totalitarian state.  It is not moving in a fascist direction.  This is merely paranoia at its worst.  Would only Nichols and his fellows be as concerned about those who really want to cause citizens here harm, it would be helpful.  But alas, they will not.  I have mentioned this elsewhere (again, at The Open Range), and may as well repeat what I once  urlLink wrote .  Basically, it focused on the nearly-neurotic hindsight pontificating about 9/11, which generally diverted focus from those fellows who actually did the crime:   Now we see it with the terrorists. Sure, they may have organized, planned, and enacted the attack that killed so many of our citizens. But it seems far too many people can't get angry at  that , but rather have to blame someone more mundane, like a domestic political official. Why? Alas, one reason that comes to mind is that it is simple. Terrorists don't make presentations at special commissions. Terrorists don't like being bothered with chit-chat. It is very hard to speak "truth to power" to bin Laden, assuming you could reach him without getting shot. But in a free society, you can hold your president to a level of omniscience usually reserved only for divinity, and assail him with all types of accusations and recriminations, and have no fear. Cuss out about the President, and no jack-booted state thugs will bust down your door. Try anything so daunting against an Islamo-fascist, and, well.....make sure your will is in order.   I would continue on Nichols, and these related rants, but there is work to be done, and I'm sure all of you would prefer I stop.  Fear not - the next post will be lighter-hearted, probably.  Or an in-depth consideration of David Lynch and dualist religion.  We'll see.  Stay tuned.

      Terribly sorry for the lack of posts as of late (yes, I can see you are all disappointed).  Too much traveling, and illness connected with it - there's nothing that helps get a slight cold to a full-blown sinus infection like being on three puddle-jumper planes in less than 12 hours.  It is a unique sensation, rather like having large icepicks shoved into your ears during the twenty to thirty minutes it takes a plane to descend.  So, up and up is, my mind is mush right now.  My hearing is at about 65-70%, I can only concentrate for very short periods of time (except when shiny metal objects are in involved, for those are infinitely interesting), and to top it all off, I have my first lecture of the summer session tomorrow.   That  should be different.  "Welcome, students, to....ummmm....huh.  I'm not sure what class this is....where am I again?  Hey, where's the professor?  Shouldn't he be in here right now?"  "Umm...sir, you  are  the professor."  "That's right!  Rock on.  Okay, ummm.....three bonus points to anyone who can tell me what I'm teaching...."  Ooooooh, much wonderment and atrocity no doubt to follow.  I will hopefully have something relatively coherent (addendum, coherent for me) in the near future.  Stay tuned, true believers - all four of you.

      If I understand right, "bleg" is the term for "blog begging," and that works here.  &nbsp;  Recently, two books by  urlLink P. J. O'Rourke  have come into my possession (specifically,  urlLink  Give War a Chance   and  urlLink  Peace Kills: America's Fun New Imperialism  ), and this got me thinking: here's a guy traveling about the globe, doing a type of second-generation gonzo journalism (which is all the more funny, since the hardcore free-market guy O'Rourke is not exactly cut from the same ideological cloth as  urlLink Hunter S. Thompson ),&nbsp;earning a respectable living from making fun of the respectable and  faux  respectable elements in world society.  &nbsp;  I want in.   No offense to the whole Ph.D. thing (and I would want to finish that), but how trippy would that be?&nbsp; Seeing the four corners of the globe for the strict purpose of satirizing them...now  there's  something that would stick out in the twenty-year high school reunion ("Oh, hi Buffy - you became an oral hygenist, eh?&nbsp; That's nice.&nbsp; Oh, me?&nbsp; Well, I just got back from that tourist trap of Dafur, Sudan,&nbsp;and before that I was&nbsp;analyzing how much of a felon you have to be to get re-elected to the Presidency in France...").&nbsp; Oooooh, much wonderment and atrocity could follow.  &nbsp;  So, this is my bleg: how, exactly, does one get O'Rourke's job?&nbsp; And reasonable answers, please - anything involving contracts with some hoove-footed individual or chicken-slaughtering voodoo rituals will be disregarded (now,  squirrel -slaughtering rituals are a different story entirely...).&nbsp; Moreover, is this a growth field, or is it a zero-sum game?&nbsp; I hope the former.&nbsp; If the latter, well, I guess you can expect a humiliating event&nbsp; - although I wager I think I can take P. J., at least if I startle him with a battlecry, like "THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!!!!"  &nbsp;  And then, he would kick my ass.  &nbsp;  Anyway, any thoughts are welcome - we are always looking for&nbsp;"Plan B"&nbsp;career options here at Umbrae Canarum.&nbsp; Stay tuned.

      Sometimes things just don't turn out as you expect.  &nbsp;  Tossing and turning last night in bed, I was thinking of a post I was going to write today, specifically on the recently defeated FMA (so, talking about issues of federalism, the perfidy of judges, the naivete of some of the chattering classes, the political circumstances that restrict options, etc.).&nbsp; I wagered it would be a longish one, and was planning on setting aside some time for it.  &nbsp;  But then, I am caught by something completely different.&nbsp; Paleface, over at  urlLink Orthos Logos , has once again raised the bar for blogging.&nbsp; Again, this is the&nbsp;guy who  urlLink quotes freakin' Keats  in posts.&nbsp; Anyway, starting from something I wrote over at  urlLink Collected Miscellany  (a post on non-fiction), he goes on to discuss  urlLink the connections between the genres of fiction and nonfiction .&nbsp; Specifically, he does this with a comparison of Jane Austen's  urlLink  Pride and Prejudice   to Xenophon's  urlLink  Memorabilia   (this is the other source on Socrates, and not necessarily in the same style as Plato's works).&nbsp;&nbsp; Better than anything I could have thought up myself, Paleface goes over the connections in the genres by certain elements, in this case "irony and its uses."  &nbsp;  Give it a read - guaranteed to increase your IQ by at least seven points, or your money back.  &nbsp;  I will hopefully have more up soon, myself.&nbsp; Stay tuned, true believers.    UPDATE : For those who are interested in reading some "low church" rather than "high church" commentary,  urlLink this article  at NRO might be worthwhile - though it seems to say quite a bit even in its byline.&nbsp; "Hans Moleman" is a made-up name.&nbsp; Apparently, getting away from the party line at the NEA is not exactly good for one's career.&nbsp; What a surprise.

        Inspired  by the daily "almanac" over at  urlLink About Last Night  ( urlLink here's  today example), I've decided to start up something similar, the Random&nbsp;Quote for the Day.&nbsp; I sincerely doubt that will be any order to it, and I wager they will go from deep thoughts to the utterly banal.&nbsp; But, you've come to suspect that already, no doubt.&nbsp; So, let it begin.    &nbsp;  "In short, it is a disposition appropriate to a man who is acutely aware of having something to lose which he has learned to care for; a man in some degree rich in opportunities for enjoyment, but not so rich that he can afford to be indifferent to loss.&nbsp; It will appear more naturally in the old than the young, not because the old are more sensitive to loss but because they are apt to be more fully aware of the resources of their world and therefore less likely to find them inadequate.&nbsp; In some people this disposition is weak merely because they are ignorant of what their world has to offer them: the present appears to them only as a residue of inopportunities."&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Lately, songs and tunes get stuck in my head.  I mentioned Monday having  urlLink Broken  playing over and over (and over and over...) in my mind.  It jumped, for a while, to Perfect Circle's  urlLink The Outsider .  On a random note, I should say I have conflicts about the lead singer, Maynard James Keenan (also lead singer for the band Tool) - the man has a wonderful singing voice.  He sings both with emotional power, in full-force, but not to the point of sounding strained or hoarse.  Moreover, the arrangements of the music, both in Perfect Circle and with Tool, are stunning - the use of guitar combinations and the like drive right into one's core, almost as if it touches on some internal harmony.  But why do so many of his lyrics have to be so damned blasphemous????  Anyway, that wasn't what I wanted to focus on.  The latest music playing in non-stop rotation through my mind is from a film,  Metropolis .  No, not  the classic 1927 silent movie ....if I have music stuck in my head from a silent film, obviously I've been having cream and acid with my morning coffee.  No, rather a little   anime  , based on a comic book from a fellow referred to as the "Godfather of Manga," Osamu Tezuka.  Anyway, the fellow in charge of the music (I think it was a guy named Toshiyuki Honda) made an interesting comment.  This fellow was trained in jazz, and the soundtrack is mostly based on one tune, a jazz-style composition.  But the tune comes up in different ways throughout - a fast, celebratory sound; a slow, New Orleans funeral speed; played with a full ensemble, then on the saxophone, then the trumpet, then a banjo (if I heard right).  The fellow, in an interview on a side DVD, described how his instructor taught him.  When making a tune, the instructor says, think of it in many ways.  Yes, it might sound great when you whistle it.  Try humming it.  Or "singing" it in a ("scat" is it called?) way.  Try it with a woodwind, a brass, a group, alone.  Try it fast, try it slow.  A truly good song, at least of this style, can accommodate these differences.  Then you know you have a good tune - when it is accessible to all these means of expression.  Now, I'm no music theorist (only one semester in college, and not exactly the top student) nor great critic, but this sounds reasonable.  But is it right?  Discuss.

      Something of a little more local interest, as in  urlLink Texas A&M  interest.  Today, in the student newspaper ( urlLink The Battalion ), there is  urlLink this story  on the increase in diversity among the graduate student population.  Fine groovy swell.  But, perhaps not.  I have  urlLink written elsewhere  about my...difficulties with what usually passes as "diversity," and this story brings it home as well.  Look at the graphic with the story - diversity enrollment is up.  A 105% increase in black students from 2003.  A 29% increase for Hispanic students.  As for the pale people, a decrease (the graph says 39%, the text 3% - I have no idea which is right), but hey, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.  But the most disturbing is the last - international students down 23%.  For the sake of diversity, this is, at least apparently, a good thing.  Ooooookay, perhaps a concrete example would help.  Among the graduate students in my department (I guess we number somewhere between 40-50), here are some of those not among the diverse: three students from China, one from Korea, one from Colombia, one from Brazil, one from Russia, one from Pakistan, one from Jordan, two from Turkey, one from Australia, and one from Japan.  These thirteen students, representing ten countries and three continents, apparently do not diversity make.  Apparently they add as much to the learning environment of A&M as the WASP people.  Sure they do.  So, what exactly  is  diversity?  After all, having students from very different nations, cultural backgrounds, and the like would  seem , at least, to be a great boon for diversity.  But, apparently not according to the Office of Graduate Studies.  So, forgive me a vulgarity, but this brings to mind the phrase "don't piss on my back and tell me it's raining."  If diversity doesn't include international students, then what in the hell DOES it mean?  Come on, administrators - toughen up.  Be straightforward.  And if you cannot be straight with us, think carefully about what that says regarding "diversity" so-called.

      For those of the political mindset, here are a couple links perhaps worth seeing.  Over at  urlLink Transterrestrial Musings , Rand talks about  urlLink the human rights double-standard  when it comes to Israel.  Specifically, he's referring to the Palestinians' nifty little kids' camps, where, as he puts it, "instead of making lanyards and leather products, learning to swim or sail, and engaging in various sports, they are learning to sneak past Israeli checkpoints, and the virtues of dying for the Palestinian cause."  Now, Human Rights Watch (as Rand notes) has voiced concerns over child soldiers in the past.  But, in this case, deafening silence.  This is problematic.  Yes, there are more than enough horror stories on both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict.  When you have what is in many ways a civil war for, oh, fifty years, chances are no one's hands are going to be completely clean.  Having said that, it is striking, and rather disturbing, that large portions of the West's educated elite are incapable or unwilling to see the qualitative differences between Israeli and Palestinian tactics (i.e. attempts to avoid collateral damage vs. the fully intentional targeting of noncombatant populations).  Perhaps it is from some delusional romanticism about the "wretched of the earth."  Or perhaps this is just a reflection of the unique malady in developed countries, probably best summed up in the term "radical chic."  But, in any case, disturbing.  And, from one disturbing element to the next, this one from the  urlLink National Review Online .   urlLink Mark W. Davis  describes a hideous new book coming out on shelves.  Perhaps you've heard of it - it's called  Checkpoint .  It's a very sweet book, really:   A major publishing house, Alfred A. Knopf, which once published H.L Mencken, D.H. Lawrence, Albert Camus, Franz Kafka - and, most recently, former president Bill Clinton's  My Life  - has decided that it is now acceptable to sell, as edgy entertainment,  Checkpoint , a novella by Nicholson Baker that explores explicit fantasies about killing President George W. Bush. With saws. With boulders. With bullets. A British newspaper reveals that a main character runs through various outrages over Iraq and concludes, "I'm going to kill that bastard."   Ah, high literature.  Let's think about this, shall we?  Imagine the Clinton administration - some "edgy" author describes his revelries about capping off dear ol' Bill in numerous ways.  Would any major publisher, or even most minor ones, have published it?  Certainly not - it would (quite rightly) belong in dusty and not-often-investigated bookstores among other delusional tracts, like  The Turner Diaries  and other such worthless drivel.  It is uncivilized to talk about assassinating a President, much less one's fantasies of doing it in sundry forms.  Clinton was scum, a dreadful President, and in many ways a waste of carbon molecules.  But he was still the President, not a tyrant.  Ah, but things are  different  now, apparently.  While the chattering classes would (quite rightly) have seen such a delusional screed against a progressive as insulting, as well as no doubt illustrating (not quite rightly) the inherently violent/bigoted/intolerant/your-slur-of-choice-here nature of rightists, apparently a work of this type against a...well, a  type  of...conservative, is nothing to bat one's eyelashes at.  One dreads to think what accolades this junk will receive.  "How daring!"  "How true!"  "In these times of oppression, a voice speaking truth to power!"  Yeah.  Hopefully, even though it is from a major publisher, this trite bit of Bush-baiting will not be received kindly by the critics, nor by the public.  But, then again, so many just gobbled up  F911  that....well, I shan't hold my breath.

      ...just wanted to wish happy birthday to the weblog  urlLink About Last Night .  Terry Teachout has  urlLink some thoughts  on being a blogger for a year....and something that would lead me to say that "great minds think alike," but I wouldn't want to insult Mr. Teachout's intelligence that way:   Blogs are the 21st-century counterpart of the periodical essays of the eighteenth century, the  Spectators  and  Ramblers  and  Idlers  that supplied familiar essayists with what was then the ideal vehicle for their intensely personal reflections. Blogging stands in the sharpest possible contrast to the corporate journalism that exerted so powerful an effect on writing in the twentieth century. Instead of the homogenized semi-anonymity of a mass-circulation magazine, it offers writers the opportunity to practice the old-fashioned art of  individual  journalism, self-published, unmediated, and interactive. That's a good example of what my theologian friend meant: the highest purpose of the Internet, a seemingly impersonal piece of postmodern technology, has turned out to be its unique ability to bring creatures of flesh and blood closer together.

      Or, once again, another reason why  urlLink Simon  rocks.  Some time ago, I wrote  urlLink a longish piece , giving my own, admittedly narrow and idiosyncratic, look at the blogosphere (long-time readers will no doubt remember it as "the post that never ends...it goes on and on my friends...").  Anyway, Simon put it up for me over at  urlLink Showcase , and some commentary has come back.  Specifically, Harvey over at  urlLink Bad Example  gives some pointers on  urlLink fighting blog invisibility .  I didn't see any that weren't helpful; although, just for sheer wit, my favorites have to be "Linking with enthusiasm"...   When you link someone's post, an intro like "XBlogger has an interesting post" is better than nothing, but if you want to win friends & influence linkees, try emoting a little and describing WHY you liked a post, e.g. "Being a guy, I like watching things blow up. That's why I really enjoyed XBlogger's post called "Fun Places to Put a Lit Firecracker". It brought back so many wonderful memories of things I've gone to jail for."   ...and a portion of "Dropping RELEVANT links in other bloggers' comments"...   ....Now for the netiquette of e-mailing links to your posts to THE BIG GUYS. This one is tricky, because it's even more intrusive than dropping links in people's comments. If commenting is standing in their living room, then e-mailing is sitting on the couch next to them. Only send a link if the post fits the blog's theme. For example, if you're going to bug  urlLink Matty O'Blackfive , your post should probably be about the military, or drinking, or drinking in the military. Or possibly making fun of  urlLink the brawling, besotted Irish .   The comments are worthwhile too....although I think Madfish Willie needs a hug.  So, now we have the sociology of the blogosphere, and how to make friends and influence people digitally.  All we need now is the Machiavellian Guide to Blog Hegemony, where you crush your opposition, becoming the alpha and omega of the weblog world.  I wager Harvey has a fellow like that in mind, the one he calls the  urlLink Puppy Blender .  Perhaps Mr. Reynolds will give us some guidance.   Naaah .  But hope springs eternal.

      As longer-time readers of this blog are aware, I have a bit of a  urlLink love/hate relationship  with technology.  It now seems to be shared.  Today,  urlLink Thomas Sowell , a guy with mental power of such magnitude that we mere mortals shudder in awe, has  urlLink a little discussion  on the mass of annoying bells-and-whistles in so much computer software.  I personally enjoyed this:   It seemed like a simple thing to buy some new software with these reference works to put into a new laptop. But so much audiovisual stuff had been added, to make looking something up in an encyclopedia seem like a trip through Disneyland, that just installing it took so much time that it made my computer guru late getting home for dinner.   The whole thing is worth a read.  Admittedly, Sowell may make too much of his case, and certainly the computer (the two-faced  urlLink Janus  of the modern world) has been marvelous.  I especially say this since one of my dearest friends is a computer engineer.  Who I haven't written/called in quite some time (sorry, Wendy....yeah, I'm a jerk, unfortunately).   UPDATE : or "d'oh! II...The Revenge."  Looking about,  urlLink Bizgirl , once again, shows the world things unseen, but that need to be seen.  Specifically, she has located  urlLink Braille t-shirts .  I would say something about that, but there are no words that can top that.

      As I probably will not have a chance to write anything of much substance today, here are a couple links to some interesting stories/statements I've run into.  Over at the  urlLink  Weekly Standard  , there is  urlLink a wonderful piece  by Bill Kristol regarding some statements by Democrats concerning the Iraq War, and our current safety.  The  urlLink  National Review   has two things worth seeing.  One is the always enlightening Jay Nordlinger, the writer of  urlLink Impromtus .  The other is technically from yesterday, via  urlLink The Corner .  There, resident curmudgeon (a term here used as complimentary) John Derbyshire has  urlLink some thoughts  on the misuse of the term "ban" in discussion of the FMA.  The money quote?   The proposed Federal Marriage Amendment would codify the conventional definition of marriage (see above). In doing so, I suppose it would "ban" polygamy. So why is this "the Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage," rather than, say, "the Constitutional amendment to ban polygamy," or "the constitutional amendment to ban marriage between human beings and aardvarks"?   The Derb is a trip.  And, he ranks among those deserving of the name "all-powerful rooster who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake."  (it's an  NR   urlLink joke , a play off the name of that most odious sonofabitch  urlLink Mobutu Sese Seko ).  Hey, the Derb can even say that he  urlLink got kicked around  by Bruce Lee - who else reading this can make that claim?  I can't.  And that, among other reasons, is why he rocks.  So, for those interested in some politics reading, give them a look.  I'll have something up for others in a little bit.   UPDATE : Or, my "d'oh!" moment for the day.  There was another post that may be of interest to y'all.  Over at Gideon Strauss's  urlLink page , he has  urlLink a post  worth looking at.  I'm not sure I would necessarily say it is "political" as much as cultural criticism, but in either case, it is something worth taking a look at - he discusses the idea of "generations-long cultural patience," a turn of phrase I have never heard before, but find most intriguing.  Peruse, and enjoy.   UPDATE II : For some more thoughts on the FMA, look at  urlLink these comments  from Mark Levin over at NRO's The Corner, where (as he puts it) "This has nothing to do with states' rights, and everything to do with activist judges. Consequently, the movement to amend the Constitution."  For another perspective, see the  urlLink Irish-Aggie News , where Courtney has a different take: "If the people feel so strongly about this issue, let it be taken up at the proper level. Maybe the federal government will have to intervene in one way or another in the future. But right now, the claim simply isn't ripe."  As Instapundit would say, "Interesting..."

      ...on and on to other blogs.  Soon, the canarum contagion will spread all over the world wide web!!!!!!!!    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!    I'm sorry...for some reason, I'm feeling dreadfully egomaniacal recently.  No doubt it's some type of compensating measure for lack of productivity.  In any case, figure I would direct y'all to my introductory post over at  urlLink Collected Miscellany , entitled  urlLink In Defense of Non-Fiction .  Yes, it is a typical rant.  But at least it's on a different topic, if nothing else.  Time to be productive.  More later, true believers.

      No, not the electronic devil machine (it may  look  like a game, but it is secretly sending out transmissions to the Alpha Centurians...damnable machine), but rather the blogger of  urlLink Simon World , now with link!  He gave this blog  urlLink a nice mention  over on his own webpage, and he is the mind behind  urlLink Showcase .  If you haven't given it a look yet, run, don't walk, to the page - in it, Simon introduces you to sundry other blogs, ones you may not have heard of, but that are worthwhile.  Give it a look, and enjoy the wondrous variety.   And Simon rocks.

      Yes, I am trying to make up for leaving things empty this weekend.  I can tell it broke all of your hearts.  What is that deafening silence I hear?  Angst.   Okay, enough shameless (and delusional) ego-boosting.  This last one is to tell you some sites you may want to view, if you haven't already.  Give the  urlLink Irish-Aggie News  a look for some discussion about taking the high road this election (we can hope, if nothing else).  Over at  urlLink Three Hell , Mer looks at the joys (or lack thereof) of the male population in Oxford (no, not  that  Oxford).  Our guy Paleface, on the spankin'-new  urlLink Orthos Logos , keeps the chat going....and quotes Keats.  Yeah, that's right - bringing some cultured literature to the blogosphere.  And you're still reading this?  Meanwhile, keeping it on level, our  urlLink Target of the Global Conspiracy  gives some thought to  Spiderman II  - definitely worth a look.  There are your tried-and-true members of the  urlLink Commentary Mandarins  to look at, such as  urlLink The Corner ,  urlLink Mirror of Justice ,  urlLink About Last Night  (naturally), and the always-insightful  urlLink Erin O'Conner .  But, perhaps you've noticed (or perhaps you haven't...{sigh}) that there is another, new link on the page.  Specifically,  urlLink Collected Miscellany , with main blogger Kevin.  I say "main" because of some changes that are coming up (I hope he doesn't mind me mentioning this - I must admit to be rather excited).  Via  urlLink Bookslut  (another excellent blog, and good God people, clean up your minds!), I saw that the CM blogger wants  urlLink some extra help .  So, I sent in, offering to join up.  Much to my happy surprise, an email comes back giving it the okay.  Sooooooo.....starting at some unspecified time (i.e. I don't know), I will be dropping some posts over at Collected Miscellany.  Should be quite fun - haven't figured out what to write on yet (yeah, big surprise, I know).  Perhaps a little  Aquinas , perhaps something else.  Perhaps something political - I recently got a copy of Daniel Kelly's   James Burnham and the Struggle for the World: A Life   (I applied for a fellowship through the  urlLink Intercollegiate Studies Institute , and with the rejection notice, they sent the book...if all grant groups did that, it might make the process  slightly  less painful), so maybe that will be up.  If memory serves, it was rather ripped on by Ted V. McAllister (author of   Revolt Against Modernity: Leo Strauss, Eric Voegelin, and the Search for a Postliberal Order  )in the  urlLink Claremont Review of Books , but still worth a shot.  Thinking of that reminds me - just finished two books last night, Terry Teachout's   The Skeptic   (an excellent book about a...unique man), and   Rivera  , a Taschen book on the Mexican artist.  Which leads me to a correction.   urlLink Earlier , I wrote that Rivera and his (I think she was his second) wife Frida Kahlo were Stalinists.  I can't speak for Ms. Kahlo at this point, but apparently Rivera was a little different than that.  He was at least a Communist, but went against the push for Socialist Realism (supported by Stalin), losing his Mexican Communist Party membership (for various reasons).  He then sided with Trotsky (before his pick-axe lobotomy), but they had a falling out (apparently Rivera was too much an anarchist for Leon's taste).  Still sympathizing with the Communists, he finally got his membership back years later.  It is trippy to read about, and see - looking at murals of his with red stars, or men holding the sickle and the hammer, or seeing that happy uniter Lenin in the artwork....much of Rivera's work is quite pleasing and interesting.  But some of the ideology underlying it is...problematic, at least.  But, different conversation for a different time.  We are now ranting.  So now we stop.  Thank you for stopping by - more later, true believers.

      As mentioned  urlLink before , Terry Teachout has presented the TCCI, which I hope to take soon.  Addendum, I'll probably be taking the modified version of it from  urlLink Gideon Strauss  (for those of us plebs who see some questions, and have no idea of what he speaks, there is a TCSI test - the Teachout Cultural Superiority Index).  But, there's another fun one as well.   urlLink Bizgirl  has pointed out a "100 Worst Films" list from the users at the  urlLink Internet Movie Database .  The trick?  See how many you've actually seen.  While I may get into it more later, this is the list so far:   'Manos' the Hands of Fate   From Justin to Kelly   The Giant Spider Invasion   Leonard Part 6   Hercules in New York   Mortal Kombat: Annihilation   Barb Wire   RoboCop 3   Superman IV: The Quest for Peace   The Avengers  (the 1998 movie, which stunk; not the 1960s series, which rocked)  There may be more - those are just the ones I remember off the top of my head.  In my defense, some of these were seen on  urlLink Mystery Science Theater 3000 .  Others were seen on TNT or the like  very very  late in the evening (at which point, you are either tired or drunk enough to watch just about anything).  And for others....well, there is no excuse.

      Just saw  urlLink this article , via netscape.com, on the possibility of delaying the November election should (God forbid) something like the attack in Madrid happen here.  I must admit to being of two minds on the matter.  On the one hand, I can see why there might be concerns, and that some planning should be done, just in case.  But on the other, this would be an unfortunate (in the least) to dangerous (at the most) precedent to set.  Sadly, I actually find myself  agreeing  with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D, California), who is quoted as saying:   "We hold elections in the middle of war, in the middle of earthquakes, in the middle of whatever it takes. The election is a statutory election. It should go ahead, on schedule, and we should not change it."   She's right - elections have been held in the midst of troubles and disaster before.  They should go on as scheduled.  I wager the American people may be a little sterner in the face of terror than the Spaniards were....and if we're not, well, we will get the candidate that we deserve.  Such is democracy.  Hopefully, this talk of postponing the election will die down, and no more will come of it.

      Sorry for the weekend's radio silence.  Alas, was just rather out-of-it, and therefore had nothing coherent to write.  Yes, yes, I know you have come to expect that, but still.  On a random note, I have Seether's  urlLink Broken  stuck in my head from the radio this morning.  What can I say?  I dig Amy Lee.  Is that so wrong?  Okay, that wasn't what I planned on writing about.  It is time for some movie discussion.  And no, it is not about David Lynch (for once).  Instead, it is about the 1990 film   King of New York  .  The biggest selling point for me initially was the lead role, played by the trippy  urlLink Christopher Walken  - he ranks among that small group of actors that can motivate me to watch a film, even if it looks like the movie version of reprocessed, vulcanized cheese.  The movie is basically about a drug lord named Frank White (Walken) who has just been released from prison, and is starting back into the business.  While one review mentioned it was "nihilistic," I wager that takes it too far.  White has a morality.  A twisted one, no doubt, but a morality never the less.  It is not an excellent film, but it is a good one.  It helps that the cast is made up of some wonderful folks, including  urlLink Wesley Snipes  and  urlLink David Caruso .  However, there is one actor who deserves special attention and praise, true believers.  Let us hear it for the high-decibel groovitude that is  urlLink Laurence Fishburne .  First, though, some prefacing.  It appears there are two types of actor in film.  On the one hand, you have those performers who aren't playing different parts  per se  - rather, they have a "character" that they just perform as different people in different situations.  An current example might be  urlLink Tommy Lee Jones , or (in an earlier era)  urlLink Humphrey Bogart .  Heck, Walken falls in that grouping, too.  There's nothing inherently wrong with it - as one buddy of mine put it, we pay to see these guys play the same people over and over again.  If it was that big a problem, no doubt the lack of profits would reveal it.  But then there is the other type of actor, the type that Fishburne exemplifies.  The other type of actor truly does "act," playing different roles and different people, submerging into the role and character as required ( urlLink Albert Finney  might be another example).  So, consider Fishburne in  King of New York , he plays White's second-hand man, a killer who seems to take inordinate glee from shooting his enemies (be they gangsters or cops).  But more to the point, Fishburne plays the role excellently - swaggering like a gang-banger, swearing and moving like a street thug, he encapsulates the role of "Jimmy Jump" in the very air he conveys.  The lines don't make the part - his very way of  being  in the role makes the character both interesting and revolting.  Not that this is the first time he played such a role - he was stuck as one of the nameless brutalizers in   Death Wish II  .  This is what makes his range so wonderful.  So, in some roles, he epitomizes the street criminal, and a violent one at that.  But then, he also plays the part of Cowboy Curtis in  Pee-Wee's Playhouse  (a role, I wager, that he would prefer to forget).  But then, much more seriously, he plays the role (as memory serves) as the rock of a flight unit in   The Tuskegee Airmen   - certainly not a flippant or vicious character.  Then there's the role of Morpheus in   The Matrix   (and its dreadful sequels) - rather like  The Tuskegee Airmen , once again he is playing a foundation-block for the rest of the characters.  But, perhaps my favorite film of his is the film version of Shakespeare's   Othello  .  Branagh does have a knack for finding good actors in these films, and Fishburne plays the title role with such ease and intensity that it ranks among my favorite movie versions of the Bard's plays.  So, what do we have here?  Fishburne as thug, psychotic thug, American flight hero, Shakespearean tragic hero, and leader of the human remnant, among sundry others.   That  is what I call range.  If only there were more actors like him, there might be more films worth seeing.  Yes, that has been our film critique for the day.  More later.  Stay tuned, true believers.

      Well, a quick one (as a break from the exams).&nbsp; I just saw that this dear little blog has been mentioned over at  urlLink splinters , the  urlLink spikemagazine.com  weblog.&nbsp; Specifically, blogger Steve  urlLink takes some issue  with the quote from Thursday, taken from Paul Johnson's   urlLink Intellectuals  .&nbsp; Or, as Steve puts it, Johnson's "ridiculously overrated book  Intellectuals ."   I'm of two minds on this.&nbsp; On the one hand, Johnson does have a tendency of overstating his case.&nbsp; And yet, on the other hand, it is nice to see some holes poked in the usual hagiography that surrounds some of our dear intelligentsia.   But, more to the point, I wager Steve is a wee bit too&nbsp;hard&nbsp;on Johnson.&nbsp; Steve takes the quote mentioned, and in particular focuses on the last two sentences.&nbsp; These are " Above all, we must at all times remember what intellectuals habitually forget: that people matter more than concepts and must come first.&nbsp; The worst of all despotisms is the heartless tyranny of ideas. "&nbsp;   To this, Steve responds:       We must remember, oh yes, and we must put people first. So what does this mean in practice,&nbsp;before ideas?&nbsp;Actually,&nbsp;first we must understand each word. But how is this done&nbsp;before we've&nbsp;had&nbsp;an idea about it? I don't know. It's confusing. I tell you what we need: we need an intellectual to bring out how complex the interaction of world and idea actually is: particularly the meaningless of prioritising one or the other. What we don't need is a red-faced old hack shouting down any whisper of reason with his despotic philistinism.     Huh.&nbsp; So, apparently, pointing out that those considered intellectuals seem to have a nasty tendency of aligning with Reigns of Terror, massacres, totalitarians, forced famines, and so forth is "shouting down any whisper of reason with...despotic philistinism."&nbsp; By simply suggesting that intellectuals are not some critically-minded, independent individualists, but all too often follow the fads, fashions, and conventions of their fields, this apparently is some great crime against reason, truth, and geometry.&nbsp; My my my.   By particularly focusing on these last two sentences, I wager that Steve may misunderstand Johnson.&nbsp; Admittedly, the last sentences of a book tend to be a little over the top - conclusions tend to be that way.&nbsp; If they were filled with nuance, qualification, context, full arguments and so forth....well, you wouldn't need the previous three-hundred and some pages, would one?   While I cannot give a running summary of his thought, I would wager he would probably be closer to, say, an Edmund Burke or Russell Kirk - that ideas are important, but must reflect on the contingencies and fallibilities of humanity.&nbsp; In Kirk's phrase, "expediency guided by principle" - certainly, ideas are of the highest importance, but one should not forget the particularities with which one is faced.&nbsp; The types of intellectuals Johnson attacks (Rousseau, Marx, Isben, Tolstoy, Bertrand Russell, Sartre, and Hellman&nbsp;among others) tend to view ideas outside of the humanity these ideas&nbsp;are meant to assist.&nbsp;  That  is where ideas become tyranny.&nbsp; I doubt this observation deserves the accusation of "despotic philistinism."&nbsp; But, if Steve does want someone to show the interconnection between ideas and practice in a better way, I wager he may benefit from reading   urlLink The Conservative Mind   by Kirk - avoids the "philistinism" of Johnson on the one hand while also avoiding the intellectuals' error of merrily marching to massacres.   But, as Mr. Johnson has spent much of his time in writing histories, I think one can hypothesize that he is not&nbsp;some know-nothing&nbsp;boob.&nbsp; But, then again, perhaps his histories don't rise to the high level of some other books suggested at splinters (by other blogger Chris), like&nbsp; The Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq  or  It's a Free Country: Personal Freedom&nbsp;In America After September 11  (featuring commentary from such political sages as Michael Moore and Matt Groening).&nbsp; Ah, yes....spare us&nbsp;Johnson's "despotic philistinism;" we have an agitprop film-maker and a cartoonist to give us political guidance - who knows?&nbsp; Maybe they're intellectuals.   But, with all that, we do thank Steve for the link.&nbsp; No publicity is bad publicity.    EDIT : I forgot to mention one other thing - the link between splinters and Umbrae Canarum is  urlLink In Writing , that has a "referring webpages" list on the side.&nbsp; Give it a look&nbsp;- definitely different from your typical blog style, and well worth the read.

      Things may be comparatively quiet here for a day or two.&nbsp; Yesterday, I gave the midterm exam to my class.&nbsp; As I have mentioned  urlLink before , grading is not something I terribly enjoy.&nbsp; But, then again, someone being  really really  excited about grading is so alien to my mindset that it seems an impossibility.&nbsp; Ah, well.   Anyway, I'll be spending this afternoon and this evening, and no doubt a good share of tomorrow, on the things.&nbsp; And, tomorrow night, I head down to Houston once again, risking life&nbsp;and limb on that rollerderby of death they call a roadway, to see the Astros and the Brewers play (one of my buddies here is from Wisconsin, and suggested the trip).   Soooooo.....there may be less messages for a bit.&nbsp; Maybe a reading list, maybe some commentary on academic anonymity in the blogosphere (brought to my attention via  urlLink Do Thy Research ), or some such.&nbsp; Haven't determined yet, although I wager you should expect sloppy grammar, bad spelling, and much grouchiness.&nbsp; I apologize now.   Stay tuned, true believers.&nbsp; Excelsior!

      "Organization into families may answer to a need of human nature, but in the last instance it is based on law, and therefore must be something odious and impossible to an anarchist.&nbsp; But, indeed, I don't understand anarchists.&nbsp; Does a man of that--of that--persuasion still remain an anarchist when alone, quite alone and going to bed, for instance?"  --Joseph Conrad, "The Informer" (  urlLink A Set of Six  )

      With all the chitchat here about aesthetics and such, I wagered I might digress for a little bit.&nbsp; In other words, this will be totally irrelevant, not terribly deep, and very much swallowed up in navel-gazing.   So don't say you weren't warned.   A little while ago, I mentioned that I was in  urlLink desperate need of a hobby .&nbsp; One possibility was painting, the only trick being that, at least so far, I have not exhibited any type of natural talent for it over.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Not even as a kid.&nbsp; Sooooo....it would be challenging, but whether in the "fulfilling the human potential within my soul" challenge or "bashing my head against a brick wall until it (whichever 'it' is) breaks" challenge, I do not yet know.   But, there is a more personal reason why painting has an appeal to me, one that came to mind last night (for some unknown reason): to show another world, specifically, the one of my eyes.   Some background.&nbsp; I am rather near-sighted (no doubt my Native American name at camp would have been "eyes like mole"), so the world looks different without glasses.&nbsp; Contacts weren't really an option - when I was younger, they inspired me to do a King Lear impersonation.&nbsp; Later in life, when "motivated" by a woman I was involved with (she had this unique method of erotic-laced hostility) (long and ugly story) to try them again, they took too long.&nbsp; So, the glasses remained.   It's odd how&nbsp;things look sans the glass-and-plastic/metal.&nbsp; I take off my glasses, and the world becomes a Monet painting - no sharp lines, no clear angles, but rather everything blurring into everything else.&nbsp; And, in a way, it is remarkably moving.&nbsp; The world, in all its shapes, is not segmented, but almost one.&nbsp; Sitting in my  urlLink Bar of Choice , or elsewhere, things are connected in my sight that aren't exactly connected when my eyes are corrected.&nbsp; And it is wonderful.   But, it has a down side.&nbsp; I mentioned in the earlier post that I am fond of the human form in painting.&nbsp; Even in this impressionist style, it could still be done, and well.&nbsp; But there's a disturbing element - while all things wonderfully blur together, one thing remains constant in most indoor light.&nbsp; I cannot see people's eyes.&nbsp; The light, going over their brows, replaces eyes with a shadow, a darkness, that isn't penetrated.&nbsp; This is disconcerting - when I can see correctly, the eyes (for me) very much are the windows to the soul.&nbsp; But now, the element that in so many ways is most beautiful in people is lost.&nbsp; In the wholeness of the blur, the core of other humans disappears.   But it gets more odd.&nbsp; While my flawed eyes relay to me the darkness that was others' eyes, there is this notion, this feeling, of my eyes not being like that.&nbsp; While the other eyes are dark, in my own&nbsp;mind I think mine are somehow bright, illuminating all else, like spotlights on the world.&nbsp; No doubt, this is from the eyes being lights to me (although, when reflecting on these things, I understand why the idea of light coming from the eyes was popular in what was the type of scientific thought in St. Augustine's day).   But then I see some reflection.&nbsp; Usually, this happens when getting a haircut, and being placed in front of those wall-long mirrors, and sit down without the glasses.&nbsp; I see myself, and can recognize my facial features.&nbsp; But my eyes, like all the others, are just as dark, just as hidden, just as gone.&nbsp; And yet, I want to paint that, too.   The world looks connected tightly, when it is blurry, when it is impressionistic.&nbsp; But, in the end, the human soul, looking out through the eyes, is outside of it.&nbsp; Everything seems to mesh together except these eyes, this human soul, that is isolated, alone, somehow outside of the realm it's in.   What it all means, if anything at all, I don't know.&nbsp; But whatever it is, I would like to put it to canvas, before such time as I get my eyes fixed or they decay further.&nbsp; It seems to reveal  something , but perhaps I can't figure out what that  something  is until putting into an activity what I see.&nbsp; Perhaps, perhaps not.   Enough navel-gazing for today.&nbsp; More later, true believers.

      I made a mistake today.&nbsp; Well, two, actually - one was in class (gave out the midterm, and one dude was taking a while - I told him he had a minute left, and he said the online listing had the class as ending at 11:35.&nbsp; I'd had it as 11:25 all this time.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; Oops)(though, as a note to undergraduates - even if you are correct, it is not wise to tell your lecturer, who knows you haven't shown up for one damn session, what "the computer" says - reflecting such lack of interest in a class is  not  the way to get brownie points).   The second was of a political junkie nature.&nbsp; I like reading political journals and other sources from the chattering class (as the long time reader says, "no, really?&nbsp; I would never have guessed!").&nbsp; And while I tend to spend more time on the ones aligned towards my conservatism, I rather do like reading more liberal ones as well (on the one hand, some are interesting and well-written; on the other, it's that whole "know thy enemy" thing).&nbsp; So, I did that today - decided to surf   urlLink The Nation  .   Bad choice.   I was in a fisking mood even before I read a particular article, just merely for the title and the text beneath - "Homophobia and Apple Pie: Bush keeps claiming to represent "normal" Americans at the expense of "the other,"" by  urlLink Robert Scheer .   Ooooh, so much to be said about that alone.&nbsp; But then, I was taken aback with trepidation.&nbsp; There has been some talk of politics here recently, and no doubt there will be more.&nbsp; But it is in the  urlLink bleem  style of commentary, where one puts forth political opinions and arguments motivated through the strong passion of happy anger.&nbsp; Nothing wrong with that, necessarily, but it can become addictive, to the point where bleem is your cardinal trait, where happiness and anger always come together and are never separated, preventing you from having a well-adjusted life with the spouse, 1.7 kids, and so forth.   And no one wants to see that happen.   So, there will be no big fisking here.&nbsp; But a little - let's just dissect just the headline and the undertext.&nbsp; I don't blame Mr. Scheer for either, since that all probably was in the control of the editors.&nbsp; But it reflects  The Nation 's mindset oh so well.&nbsp; "Homophobia."&nbsp; What a wonderful word, guaranteed to stifle any discussion on a particular group of policy issues.&nbsp; "What, you aren't stepping in partisan line with  The Nation / The Advocate /ACT UP/whatever?&nbsp; Obviously, you couldn't have any rational reason to disagree.&nbsp; You must be prejudiced, or even more, irrationally scared.&nbsp; Perhaps you're repressing something?&nbsp; Perhaps you are transferring your feelings?&nbsp; Tell me about your mother!"   With just the one word, we are no longer in the realm of political or moral discourse, but instead channeling the ghost of Sigmund Freud.   But then, there's the undertext.&nbsp; Bush doing all this at the expense of "the other."&nbsp; To quote that sage of wisdom, Spider-man, that's rather like "the pot calling the kettle teflon."&nbsp; Whether resulting from sheer lack of self-reflection, or ideology, it is rather funny to see  The Nation  talking about marginalizing "the other."&nbsp; After all, it seems they manage to marginalize those outside their office as "the other."&nbsp; Take the headline again.&nbsp; "Homophobia."&nbsp; As shocking as it may be to the editors, there are many individuals in this country who are not exactly cheery about the prospect of same-sex marriage.&nbsp; Whether for reasons of religion, or by considering its effects on social institutions, or regarding matter of the Constitution (among others), we do have reasons.&nbsp; But not to  The Nation .&nbsp; Apparently, we are Bible-beating, rosary-clutching, difference-fearing, slack-jawed theocrat-wannabes trying to viciously prevent the enjoyment of fundamental rights (from where, non-existent monotheistic being knows).   But, of course, they are talking about we "others" in a non-marginalzing way (a good piece to look at would be  urlLink this article  by Christopher Shannon on "Catholicism as the Other" - an "other" not likely to be given much attention at  The Nation ).   So, we have gone through all of this, and the article has not yet been addressed.&nbsp; Nor will it.&nbsp; Bleem must have its limits.&nbsp; And addressing these issues must not be a bleem-directed activity, but one of reason (rightly understood).&nbsp; But that would require a book(s) - the language of "rights;" the question of morality, religion, and state power; the ideas in and about the Constitutiuon; and sundry others....these are things that cannot be addressed in a blog.&nbsp; Nor well by the chattering class journals.&nbsp; But only by deeper reading, consideration, and judgment.   But bleem lives on.&nbsp; Oh, dreadful bleem, you wicked mistress!&nbsp; Why do you torment me so?

      "One of the principle lessons of our tragic century, which has seen so many millions of innocent lives sacrificed in schemes to improve the lot of humanity, is - beware intellectuals.&nbsp; Not merely should they be kept well away from the levers of power, they should also be objects of particular suspicion when they seek to offer collective advice.&nbsp; Beware committees, conferences and leagues of intellectuals.&nbsp; Distrust public statements from their serried ranks.&nbsp; Discount their verdicts on political leaders and important events.&nbsp; For intellectuals, far from being highly individualistic and non-conformist people, follow certain regular patterns of behaviour.&nbsp; Taken as a group, they are often ultra-conformist within the circles formed by those whose approval they seek and value.&nbsp; That is what makes them,  en masse , so dangerous, for it enables them to create climates of opinion and prevailing orthodoxies, which themselves often generate irrational and destructive courses of action.&nbsp; Above all, we must at all times remember what intellectuals habitually forget: that people matter more than concepts and must come first.&nbsp; The worst of all despotisms is the heartless tyranny of ideas."  --Paul Johnson,   urlLink Intellectuals  .

      For those who are interested in some further thoughts on art, aesthetic sensibility, and the like, give a look at  urlLink the Greater Nomadic Council .&nbsp; In responding to  urlLink my earlier post &nbsp;[while looking there, make sure to give the comments a read - Kevin gives some thoughts on a canon, and the Teaching Assistant gives some good reflection on the matter],&nbsp;the blogger (mallarme)&nbsp; urlLink brings up a point &nbsp;that, at least as far as I've read, as been left completely unaddressed.&nbsp; And, following that,  urlLink beautifully points in the direction  of addressing it.&nbsp; Especially the phrase "a conversation among the generations" strikes me - it almost sounds Burkean.&nbsp; Any future thought I will give to these matters will no doubt be influenced by the reflections - so stop reading this and give them a look.   Onward and upward, to deeper and higher beauty.    UPDATE : Over at  urlLink Do Thy Research , the Teaching Assistant has been kind enough  urlLink to quote me .&nbsp; I'm very much looking forward to hearing some more thoughts from her on the issue of aesthetics - hopefully not too far in the future.

      I just realized I said I wouldn't spend a lot of time on the previous post.&nbsp; Ooops.   Well, something lighter, then.   On a happy note, a friend of mine who was laid off some time ago is now employed again.&nbsp; This is excellent news, and I'm happy more than you know for this result.   Huh.&nbsp; Something nicer.....   Once there was a man named Frank  Who was planning on robbing a bank  But if he was smarter  He wouldn't go to the water  But lo, at the riverbank he sank.

      I had planned on having some discussion about "reduction" and the like  urlLink before , but unfortunately formatting problems intervened.&nbsp; As such, it was dropped.&nbsp; I would have some quotes and such as well here, but not going to run the risk again.   Instead, I will just direct y'all over to some commentary.&nbsp; The article in question, from the New York Times Magazine, refers to the "reduction" procedure.&nbsp; This is where, in a pregnancy with multiple....well, what is the right term?&nbsp; Children?&nbsp; Fetuses?&nbsp; Entities?&nbsp; Globs of cells?....are narrowed down.&nbsp; In this case, there were three of these...entities, and two were "reduced."&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; As the article author puts it (she is writing about her own experience), " ...now I'm going to have to move to Staten Island. I'll never leave my house because I'll have to care for these children. I'll have to start shopping only at Costco and buying big jars of mayonnaise. "   You know, these deep moral concerns we all have of&nbsp;being stuck going&nbsp;to that sixth circle of Hell, Costco.   Needless to say, this has been the cause for much discussion in certain circles.&nbsp; An online article about it can be found  urlLink here .&nbsp; Within the blogopshere, other comments come from  urlLink Mirror of Justice  (specifically,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) and NRO's The Corner ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ).   I won't spend much time on this one.&nbsp; Others have said these things far better than I could.&nbsp; And, indeed the whole abortion matter is exceptionally divisive (as the audience thinks, "no kidding, Einstein").&nbsp; I remember a friend of mine and I getting into a heated argument over this (neither of us is exactly a huge fan of abortion, Catholics both, but the debate was on how much this one issue should decide one's vote.&nbsp; As my friend said, "It's just so big, you can't think about it" [or some such], and all I could respond was, "It is so big, and I can't help but think about it" [or some such])(yeah, verbatim stuff here - glad I didn't go into journalism).   But, in any case, this is disturbing.&nbsp; Life and death determined by the convenience of someone else.&nbsp; A fundamental right for one as the basis for removing all rights, and possibility of rights, from another.   Let's be reductivist for a minute, here.&nbsp; After all, one of the major elements in the abortion controversy is religion.&nbsp; Can make arguments bloody difficult sometimes - apparently, being a converted Catholic means that any statement I make regarding abortion must be my insidious effort to move the US capitol to the Vatican and force all others to live under the yoke of papist oppression (or, if not argued quite so, simply enough done by "keep your rosaries off my ovaries").&nbsp; So, let us consider the matter without religion.&nbsp; I won't enter in any ambiguous terminology about "souls" or "God" or any of that business, as long as the dear readers who disagree with me will also avoid such ambiguity.&nbsp; We will leave to the side dealing with the ambiguous term "rights," at least for the moment, as that would make things even more tricky.   Or, in other words, let us use "relatively reliable methods of inquiry," as that term is used by Gutmann and Thompson (two proponents of deliberative democracy theory) in their   urlLink Democracy and Disagreement  .&nbsp; Let's use methods we all could probably agree on.&nbsp; This is where we get reductivist.&nbsp; If we look at the matter biologically, when can one say an individual animal can be traced as originating?&nbsp; Certainly, not at birth - no mystical magical event happens in the birth canal taking a non-existing thing into an existing one.&nbsp; Something has been happening before.&nbsp; But when does the "before" start?&nbsp; It must be before the third and second "trimesters," or else how could they be "second" or "third" anything?&nbsp; So, we must look to the first trimester.&nbsp; It would seem that the origins of an individual animal would be the beginning of such a trimester.&nbsp; That would be at or near conception.&nbsp; As a mere biological fact, life begins at conception.   So, what does that mean for our debate?&nbsp; One cannot say that the entity in the womb is a mere "glob of cells" - it is either false (globs of cells don't go through the necessary developments of maturation) or truistic (everyone reading this is a glob of cells).&nbsp; So, we need to take another step.&nbsp; Where do life and rights coincide?&nbsp; Where there is life, are their rights?&nbsp; For we radical pro-lifers, the answer would be "yes."&nbsp; Therefore, abortion (barring extreme circumstances) is out.&nbsp; But, what if one says that life is necessary but not sufficient for rights?&nbsp; Well, then, what do rights connect with?&nbsp; Consciousness?&nbsp; Ah, but we have violated our rules at the beginning - we have entered in ambiguity, and we are no longer staying with "relatively reliable methods of inquiry."&nbsp; "Consciousness" is a dreadfully problematic term, in many ways like "soul" that way.&nbsp; Is "consciousness" the ability to experience pain?&nbsp; Then apparently ants have rights.&nbsp; The same problem may arise if we say it is a creature with a certain preference set determined by desires - most higher animals would count (Fido, therefore, may be entitled to the vote).&nbsp; Is it some level of cognizant, voluntary motion?&nbsp; Depending on what "cognizant" means, children under six months may not have rights.   Besides, why is "consciousness" some great provider of right?&nbsp; For all we know, it may merely be epiphenomenal - a mere appearance brought on by a multiplicity of biochemical (or possibly quantum) activities in our gray matter, merely following the lines of determinate or probabilistic rules of nature.&nbsp; Why should that, then, be the standard for rights?   Why go through all this brickabrack?&nbsp; From a fear.&nbsp; Past experience illustrates that a society that limits the definition of "human" to not include all human life is asking for moral horror.&nbsp; You don't need to agree with him to see how a Peter Singer can be totally consistent.&nbsp; By claiming some life is unworthy of life, or that some life has no right to existence, where does one draw the line without it being arbitrary?&nbsp; Where can one say "this is too far," having allowed the one "reliable" method in a pluralistic society to be put to the side?   Yes, this article, and this issue, bothers me - can we feel secure in a society that will not give to its most helpless, faced with imposed death,&nbsp;the same protections as the most vicious murderer (trial, due process, counsel, appeals, execution by a duly appointed agent of the state rather than a private citizen)?&nbsp; Do we feel safe where existence can be ended on the decision of a private citizen?&nbsp; Can we feel justified, and morally sound, when we declare that the&nbsp;liberty of some outweigh absolutely the life and all liberties of others?&nbsp; I cannot feel safe, cannot feel secure, cannot feel justified or morally sound, nor&nbsp;reasonably assent to&nbsp;these things to myself, when faced with such a thing.   Existence should never be a capital offense.    UPDATE :  urlLink Jennifer Graham  has some other thoughts on the Amy Richards article, and over at the  urlLink Corner , there is some discussion of&nbsp;a rather disingenuous column from Barbara Ehrenreich on the issue of abortion.

      I try not to be unhappy with technology.&nbsp; That I write a blog would seem to indicate that.&nbsp; And yet, sometimes the urge to  urlLink destroy the machine  returns.&nbsp; And all I had to do today was look at the campus newspaper to have my "urge-to-smash" desire rise up again.   Over at the corner of Texas and Southwest in town, there used to be a McDonald's, one of the at least three that are about in town.&nbsp; Well, it was&nbsp; urlLink torn down &nbsp;for being too "outdated."&nbsp; Kitchen, tables, counters, restrooms....apparently for the burger joint of the future, this is simply subpar.   So, let us look into the future.   The future, Phil?   The future, nameless voice in my head.&nbsp; Let us look all the way into the month November.   &nbsp;   In the month November...    There will be wireless internet available in McDonald's.&nbsp; This will be hailed as an advance, as getting a quick bite late at night will no longer&nbsp;interrupt male college students from their work...downloading porn.    In the month November...    The McDonald's will include a game room with arcades aimed at older age groups, allowing students to harden their arteries, limit their attention spans, and fry their eyes at the same time.    In the month November...    The McDonald's will have a "distinct 'Hill Country'" look, after complaints that typical franchises looked too "froo-froo sophisticated."   &nbsp;  We have seen the future, and I shudder.   [for those unfamiliar&nbsp; (you poor, culturally-deprived souls), this is a rip-off of Conan O'Brien's " urlLink In the Year 2000 ."&nbsp; He does it much better.]

      By various means, through sundry sources, a topic for today has finally come to mind - and that topic?&nbsp; Aesthetics.  &nbsp;  This ought to be interesting - my training in that field is somewhat slim (i.e. with the exception of  urlLink one book  read on a whim, non-existent), and to call me "culturally-deprived" would be speaking too nicely.&nbsp; But, as ignorance has (thus far) never stopped me before, here goes.  &nbsp;  First, the link-o-rama.&nbsp; The topic comes to mind thanks to some different articles or posts that have recently caught the attention.&nbsp; Probably the most talked about was a recent  urlLink NEA report  [ WARNING : .pdf file]&nbsp;on the reading proclivities (or lack thereof) of the American population.&nbsp; So, there was some discussion over at by Kevin at  urlLink Collected Miscellany  (" The threat to intelligent culture is not from literati snobs who demean intelligent visual media to promote boring and out of date high brow literature. Instead intelligent culture is threatened by the race for the bottom... "); Peter Wood threw in  urlLink his two cents  at NRO (" The main prices of being ill-read are cultural superficiality, loss of historical context, susceptibility to ideological provocations, and a certain kind of spiritual aimlessness. Granted, these tax some people more than others. "); and  urlLink Bookslut  links to a couple other comments as well.&nbsp; Some other discussion can be found at the  urlLink Greater Nomadic Council , and no doubt in many other blogs, newspapers, and so forth (Alas, nothing from  urlLink Terry Teachout  - thanks to his nomination to the  urlLink National Council of the Arts , he has to keep mum on all things NEA for the moment).  &nbsp;  Then there is art.&nbsp; Over at the   urlLink National Review Online  , there is a  urlLink question-and-answer article  with Roger Kimball (managing editor for   urlLink The New Criterion  ), who talks about his newest book,  urlLink  The Rape of the Masters  , which addresses how the concern with aesthetics in art history these days tends to take a backseat to the proselytizing of one's -ism of choice.  &nbsp;  Now, why present all of this?&nbsp; To address what might be an underlying problem recognized in both - a chronic lack of&nbsp;aesthetic skill/education, or in other words, taste,&nbsp;in current American culture.  &nbsp;  While I've delved into this somewhat  urlLink elsewhere , may as well take another swing at it.&nbsp; To have a developed aesthetic sense would seem to require two things - education, and (more importantly) leisure, in the&nbsp;way Aristotle would use the term.&nbsp; Both will be addressed in turn.  &nbsp;   Education  - as a good deal of my readership is about the same age as myself, I ask you to walk through memory lane, especially those of you who (like myself) are products of our public education system.&nbsp; Think back especially to your English, Reading, or Literature classes.&nbsp; You probably read some canonical authors (Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Austen, Dickens, Hawthorne, Poe) and some more recent (Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hemingway), and perhaps some random ones (Kinsella or the like).&nbsp; Fine groovy good.&nbsp; But while you were immersed in these, can you think, at any time, your teachers giving you some guidance or clarity regarding what separates a good work of literature from a bad one?&nbsp; Do you think most of your teachers had such an understanding themselves?&nbsp; While the students are surrounded by such texts, they have little idea what makes these particular works excellent.&nbsp; No rubric, no general feel....heck, often times not even some solid language to use.  &nbsp;  So, we have the first step to a unliterary population (and this may apply as well to art) - a high school (or perhaps, sadly, even college) educated individual does not receive the basics in looking at a work in terms of taste, but only as a list that was decided by God knows who.&nbsp; This leaves the door open for those who would deconstruct these texts and authors (or paintings and artists) as ideology sees fit.&nbsp; So, if one doesn't know how to begin in considering aesthetically, say, the  Inferno , what prevents a dedicated zealot from simply saying it has value as some "transgressive boundary-crossing" on, say, the issues of sodomites (I don't joke - it's from an article from the, admittedly questionable, John E. Boswell, in&nbsp; Dante Studies , CXII in 1994).&nbsp; Or, perhaps one could say it has no value at all: perhaps a menu's as good as a myth (while I picked that up from a comic book...yeah, high literature...from a villain deconstructionist claiming that a fish-and-chips menu had as much literary value as  Moby Dick , apparently it is a line in  urlLink a poem .&nbsp; Who knew?).&nbsp; Where there is no education in taste, there is a vacuum begging to be filled by indoctrination.  &nbsp;   Leisure  - for Aristotle, this referred to a certain free space from activities dealing with the necessities of life, where one could develop more fully the virtues, speculation, etc.&nbsp; Does the modern American have something like this?&nbsp; An excellent question....probably most don't, if we would transport Aristotle to the present.&nbsp; But at the same time, certainly most of us are not working the farm from an hour before dawn to two hours after dusk.&nbsp; But there are problems.  &nbsp;  The first, and perhaps the most difficult, problem is a lack of self-discipline.&nbsp; As various of the posts/articles mentioned above point out, it is very hard to pull one's self away from the brain-candy that is the TV.&nbsp; But also, you may be part of the issue now&nbsp;- blogs themselves (as Wood mentions) are not exactly high literature, and yet many of us spend  waaaaaay  too much time on them.&nbsp; Indeed, I could be adding to the problem now (how's  that  for a paradox).  &nbsp;  But, seriously - we are in an age where instant gratification is not quick enough.&nbsp; TV around the clock, drivel CDs to play in the car, quickie blogs and online articles when one is near a computer - heck, theoretically, you could be with all these things at once.&nbsp; The discipline to sit back, to consider, to sink into a book or painting and  absorb  it (for lack of a better term) is missing.  &nbsp;  This leads to the second problem in leisure, touching on the lack of education.&nbsp; Say you have managed, in some fashion or another, to force yourself into a discipline of using your leisure well.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; So, you must find literature to read, to absorb.&nbsp; Your background has not left you terribly prepared for the pilgrimage to Borders Bookstore.&nbsp; And let's be honest - in fiction and nonfiction both, there is a great deal of garbage.&nbsp; Some of it is highly praised and popular garbage, but garbage all the same.&nbsp; Just finding something worthwhile to use on leisure is trick enough itself.&nbsp; About all you can do is try and start with some tried-and-true novels or poems, and hope that, as time goes along, you can pick up (via good book reviewers or the like) which recent works are worth one's bother.  &nbsp;  Is there a way to stop this, and indeed, help make the population, or at least some of it, more attuned to good taste?&nbsp; In the short-term, I have no idea.&nbsp; Long-term, perhaps - if the habits of reading and viewing paintings are encouraged by parents, even if they themselves are only grasping to know what taste is, a few generations down the line, perhaps the arts, literature, and culture will have a resurgence.  &nbsp;  Hope springs eternal.

      "Whence it may be further inferred that excellence must be the care of the state which is truly so called, and not merely enjoys the name: for without this end the community becomes a mere alliance which differs&nbsp; only in place&nbsp;from alliances of which the members live apart; and law is only convention, 'a surety to one another of justice,' as the sophist Lycophron says, and has no real power to make the citizens good and just."  --Aristotle,   urlLink The Politics  .

      ....is still disgusting.  &nbsp;  While talking to a student outside today, I saw something new.&nbsp; It wasn't exactly the same as a tarantula, but about the same size -&nbsp;a hairy, eight-legged, walking nightmare.&nbsp; It was a freakin' huge spider.&nbsp; Apparently it was technically a " urlLink rabid wolf spider " [if you don't like spiders, I don't suggest you hit the link] - different from your run-of-the-mill arachnid freak, this charming thing (about the size of a man's hand) does not trap prey in webs, but rather runs the suckers down.  &nbsp;  Now, I'm no fan of spiders in general, and large ones specifically.&nbsp; The only words I can find to best describe it come from the height of popular culture, the  urlLink  X-Files  :  &nbsp;   Fox Mulder: "I had a praying mantis epiphany. And, as a result, I screamed - not a girly scream, but the scream of someone being confronted by some before-unknown monster that had no right existing on the planet I inhabited. {...}The mysteries of the natural world were revealed to me that day, but instead of being astounded, I was...repulsed."    Dana Scully: "Mulder, are you sure it wasn't a girly scream?"  &nbsp;  Yes, that about sums it up (and no, it was not a girly scream.&nbsp; Screw you, hippie).  &nbsp;  The student I was with informed me about this monstrosity, and said one of its favored meals was the cockroach.  &nbsp;  So I am torn.&nbsp; On the one hand, the spider is a loathsome type of vermin.&nbsp; And yet, it is the natural enemy of  urlLink Gargantuan the Ugly .&nbsp; So, what to make of it?&nbsp; Is the enemy of my enemy my friend?&nbsp; Or is the enemy of my enemy my enemy?  &nbsp;  But, that looks at it the wrong way.&nbsp; I seem to be thinking through this as either/or.&nbsp; Much better is the direct approach - exterminate them all, and let God sort them out.

      The last post rambled a bit.&nbsp; It could use summary.&nbsp; But I am not in the mindset to summarize now (or else it would have been shorter in the first place).&nbsp; So, if you are interested in some random musings on what it is to be a gentleman, what has harmed the idea, and how it can be saved, please read on and comment.&nbsp; If not, well.....check in later.&nbsp; No doubt something better will be here.  &nbsp;  "Better" naturally meaning "shorter."  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Perhaps even "funny."  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  If nothing else, at least "coherent" (comparatively).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yeah, it's time to stop now.

       [Warning - this post is long, and tends to go here and there a bit, but I promise it does have a point.&nbsp; It just takes a while to get there]   &nbsp;  While it is said that Texas is "a whole other country" (oft times by the locals themselves), it might be more appropriate to say that it is a whole other time.&nbsp; While here, in portions of it, I have for a quick moment entered into a place decades, if not centuries, behind the modern world.&nbsp; It was a "backwardness" very much worth emulating.  &nbsp;  The first was at Houston's international airport - admittedly, not a place one usually looks for anachronisms (except, perhaps, for the silly architecture of the 1970s or the organizational set-up of a 1960s banana republic), but here there was one.&nbsp; I was just coming back from somewhere, a conference or home from Indiana, and we were taking one of those minibuses from our puddle-jumper plane to the terminal.&nbsp; Shuffling along as people do after flights, two women (perhaps no older than 45) walked up, and looked for a seat - immediately, four of the men on the bus stood up, offering their respective places.&nbsp; As one of the women said in a cheerful voice, "It's so nice to be in Texas again!"  &nbsp;  The second time was at an IHOP in dear Aggieland, early in the morning on a weekend (or, in other words, the prime time for the "stumbling drunk" crowd).&nbsp; At one of the groups of revelers (a collection of men and women), there was an exceptionally loud fellow who, it can be honestly said, was a hick.&nbsp; The dirty ballcap, the thick East Texas accent, the grimy T-shirt and jeans, the mullet, the whole nine yards epitomizing the legendary "redneck."&nbsp; At one point, one of the guys made some vulgar remark towards one of the women (perhaps his girlfriend).&nbsp; Our hick would have nothing of it - he repeated again and again, "you apologize to her!"&nbsp; In his eyes, you could see anger bordering on fury.&nbsp; His body was tensing, the way someone prepares his muscles for a brawl.&nbsp; Although a policeman was merely a wall away (and had already given the group a hard look-over), this redneck was ready to punch the face of the lout.&nbsp; The lout apologized.  &nbsp;  Now, a last story, from centuries ago.&nbsp; Whether it&nbsp;relates an historical fact&nbsp;or is merely a morality tale, I&nbsp;do not hazard a guess.&nbsp; There was&nbsp;once a king, most noble and imbued with chivalry.&nbsp; While leading his army to victory, he was treacherously shot in the back with an arrow.&nbsp; With the battle done, the king was taken to his castle, where the arrow had to be removed.&nbsp; But it was in deeply, and trying to pull in out caused the royal great suffering - so much so that he would&nbsp;throw off all those who tried to hold him down, from&nbsp;his assistants, the court, and indeed even the strongest knights.&nbsp; Finally, someone had an idea.&nbsp; They called in the fairest maiden in the entire castle, and had her lightly place her hands against those of the king.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow was pulled out, for the king made no move whatsoever.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because he was a gentleman&nbsp;- the idea of harming a woman was more repulsive than the physical pain of an arrow.  &nbsp;  Why this medieval tale?&nbsp; And why do I say these things from Texas are from an older time?&nbsp; Because they represent, perhaps only as mere shadows, the notion of being a gentleman.&nbsp; We see here elements of the style of living that used to be called "being a man," before that term was debased by the thugs of the modern era.&nbsp; For the&nbsp;men on the plane, perhaps this shows that chivalry is not dead, even if on the ropes.&nbsp; As for the redneck, certainly the alcohol removed inhibitions.&nbsp; But his reaction also gives some hope - that even those who lack the usual redeeming qualities, at their core, can be moved to anger by an ungentlemanly act.  &nbsp;  What, exactly, does "being a gentleman" mean?&nbsp; An excellent question, but not easily answered.&nbsp; Indeed, perhaps some of the ways we have tried to answer illustrate the difficulties in these modern days.&nbsp; In questions of morality, we are used to the shallowness of emotivism, the dry nature of categorical imperatives, or the general contradictions of postmodern "ethics" thinking.&nbsp; The idea of being a gentleman, the idea of chivalry, is not something that lends itself to systematizing - it focuses on action, and indeed perhaps evades full realization unless put into practice.&nbsp; It is a way of life, a way of tradition and  mores , and not so much one of systems,&nbsp;much less categorical lists of "do's" and "dont's."  &nbsp;  To be a gentleman is perhaps best seen in relations, the relations to others - specifically, the ties that bind through obligation.&nbsp; But, perhaps even more, the practice of chivalry requires a certain cast of mind and habituation - the ability to know when to be gentle and when to be fierce, to know what is worth disregarding and what worth fighting over, but perhaps most of all, the habituation of right action regarding women.  &nbsp;  This last one, I think, I will focus on - discussing being a gentleman, without regarding its deep connection to the fairer sex, would be incoherent.&nbsp; Moreover, in these days, man/woman relationships (I refuse to say "male/female" - we aren't cattle or chimps here, but human beings) best illustrate the sad decay of the gentleman today.  &nbsp;  Anyone familiar with most state college campuses understands that interactions between the sexes too often resembles the heyday of the Mongol hordes&nbsp;- many of the bars are aptly labeled "meat markets."&nbsp; There are many thugs and many weaklings, but few gentlemen about.&nbsp; An excellent dissection of this was done by Terrence O. Moore, under the title " urlLink Wimps and Barbarians " (with a follow-up, " urlLink Heather's Compromise ").&nbsp; He argues that the  thumos  (if you've read Plato's  Republic , think silver) of young men today is either overdeveloped (leading to the "barbarians"), or underdeveloped (thus, the "wimp").&nbsp; The place between the extremes is the gentleman.&nbsp; Extremism, alas runs rampant - either there are men with no chests or only chests (to use a term from C. S. Lewis).&nbsp; Women are generally treated dreadfully poorly, and certainly not with the respect that a man should give.  &nbsp;  But why?&nbsp; There are various reasons.&nbsp; First, we live in a day and age where tradition is little respected, either because of a desire for autonomy (and thus the tossing aside of all superstitions or customs that do not glorify free choice) or the drive for efficiency (tradition may be many things, but it generally lacks a flow-chart structure).&nbsp; But also, there are the changes in the relations between the sexes, the equality recognized, the changes in the workforce.&nbsp; This in and of itself does not require the death of chivalry, but thanks to certain, perhaps contingent, elements, it did drive the gentleman away.&nbsp; On the one hand, there was feminism - chivalry was an example of the "gilded cage" men put women in.&nbsp; Yes, women were respected, but at a cost to liberty and equality.&nbsp; Moreover, chivalry has (against the spirit of the age) at its core an essentialism - women and men are different, and men must respect that.&nbsp; Among some feminists, and certainly various "identity-border-crossing" fetishists in academia, this is intolerable.  &nbsp;  And then, there are the attitudes of men themselves.&nbsp; With men and women recognized not only as equal, but basically the same; with the easy access of contraception of various types; with old social  mores  tossed to the side; with the highly sexualized nature of society - more and more men saw these changes as avenues to sexual license, lack of responsibility, the tossing of of duties.&nbsp; It was  Lord of the Flies  with the occasional (or more than occasional) hook-up.&nbsp; They saw it, and found it good.  &nbsp;  So, we are now at today.&nbsp; Men are, for the most part, not gentlemen.&nbsp; Most probably would not even understand what that entails (for my own part, on the wimp-gentleman-barbarian scale, I know I tend to the "wimp" side).&nbsp; Are we stuck with this?&nbsp; Is chivalry lost, to be replaced with a sex-obsessed masculinity that refuses to accept the joys and pains of honor and duty?&nbsp; Is the gentleman dead, and beyond resurrection?  &nbsp;  Perhaps.  &nbsp;  But perhaps not.&nbsp; But it will take generations to make a change.&nbsp; Moral education is necessary.&nbsp; And this is not an education that can be provided (or only partially) in a school - it is the responsibility of fathers,&nbsp;and all men in general, to serve as models to the boys of today.&nbsp; A man being a gentleman, and guiding a youth along in these ways, is of more use than one hundred books or a thousand blogs.&nbsp; Again, chivalry is a matter of practice - practice no doubt guided by general, if somewhat underdefined, principles, but practice all the same.&nbsp; By forcing one's self to be a gentleman - respect for women, respect of duty, care for the soul - one is a walking textbook for others.&nbsp; And for them, others still.&nbsp; In the slow, gradual process of moral practice, perhaps (three generations down the line) the idea of chivalry will return.&nbsp; Different in some specifics from the past, no doubt, but still bringing about what is needed most....  &nbsp;  Men with chests.

      Like I said, not exactly in the best shape today, so this may be today's last one. But, hopefully a good one. { "yeah, right..." saith the audience }  Anyway, as you perhaps noticed (or not), there is a new type of link in the Sponsors section, for  urlLink Texas Blogs , a webring for those within the Free and Sovereign Republic. Figured it might be a nice thing to join.  But, this got me thinking (an admittedly questionable choice of action for me on any given day) about something missing in the blog realm. There are webrings for regions, political affiliations, for poetry, for philosophy, for animals, for questionable sexual practices, for those involved in that constant and ugly battle of pro-cat or anti-cat...and so forth. But there is one that is missing. Perhaps the hole should be filled.  Specifically, I'm thinking about the blogs that violate one of the (perhaps less-well-thought-out) posting rules I talked about in my  urlLink summa blogospheriae  - that one needs to specialize, or " In effect, for a blog to be successful, it cannot be the Ed Sullivan Variety Show of the Internet ." I am starting to question that idea.  The blogs I look at the most (and, generally, are listed with the links) are not specialized at all. Yes, there may be some running themes, but they usually reflect the personality of the blogger more than some set group of topics.  Sooooooo.....I wonder - should there be an "Ed Sullivan Variety Show" webring? Certainly, there must be many of these free-floating blogs about, but that are dreadfully hard to locate. Might be a possiblility....  But, then again, I wager that, as with all things, this is an idea that has been thrown out 473 times already, tried, and either failed miserably or is difficult to locate. { sigh } Yeah, at this point, I'm just thinking out loud. Better tomorrow, or your money back.

      While there are various lists for finding new blogs, the  urlLink Carnival of the Vanities  and  urlLink Showcase  coming to mind, there is a new one. Its name is based of a feature over at the  Wall Street Journal  Online called " urlLink Best of the Web ." Now, I present to you, the " urlLink Worst of the Web ." Much fun, and perhaps bleem, no doubt shall come from it.  Note, though, that I present this new page for entertainment purposes only,  not  as a place to send this blog's address to. If I find out that happens....well, I was about to say "severe consequences will follow," but I thought the better of it - for all I know, you're all steroid-freak Olympians with large amount of stock in Fortune 500 companies, so I can't really assume I can cause harm.  Well, I can guarantee a very stern and unhappy look. And no one wants that.  [hat tip to  urlLink Martinis, Persistence, and a Smile  for the link]

      "Admittedly, it would be unfair to expect our political conventions to be showcases of candor and genuineness. They are by design high-tech political commercials in which each side spins the facts to put its candidates in the most favorable light possible.  And let me say, for the sake of intellectual honesty, that the Republicans are no better than the Democrats. In 2000, the GOP trotted out one Prozac Republican after another, as if the entire show was produced by the talents behind "Mr. Rogers." All that was missing was George W. Bush strolling out to the stage as he put on a grandfatherly sweater singing "Won't you be my voter? Would you be mine? Could you be mine?"" -- urlLink Jonah Goldberg .

      While there will be more up soon, I must admit to being exhausted. Texas is a nice state, don't get me wrong - but the weather has managed to take the wind out of the sails of everyone here. I find myself feeling the desire to sleep all the time. I almost missed my lecture today - running in, I see that (from a class of 34) seven students have arrived. They ask for the day off. I don't want to lecture. I accept.  And now, just trying to concentrate, trying to cool off, trying not to feel sticky from the great humidity. And it fails.  A  siesta  sounds good....if only my office had a bed, even an inflatable mattress....huh, desks can't be  that  hard....

      After&nbsp;my venting in  urlLink my previous post , mallarme asked for a little more.&nbsp; Being one always willing to rant (the audience: " now  you figure this out?"), I will continue (and keep in mind his concerns, and the points from Kevin).   Basically, the question comes down to grade inflation, that bane&nbsp;of the contemporary (at least state) university, which seems more and more a degree-factory rather than a place of learning.&nbsp; Some thoughts on the matter.   I agree with Kevin - how hard one grades depends in a large part upon what your department will allow.&nbsp; Thankfully, my department has not been one to push inflation of grades or the like.&nbsp; Does that mean it doesn't happen?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Because there are other factors to consider.   Again, as Kevin puts it, there is the danger of expecting too much from one's students.&nbsp; While one doesn't want to inflate grades, deflating isn't exactly better ("You forgot the fourth word, in the original Latin, of the second paragraph&nbsp;in Book VII of&nbsp;Augustine's  De Civitate Dei ????&nbsp; YOU FAIL.").&nbsp; But, generally speaking, the desire to be such a hard-ass is something one dreams about before TAing or teaching, and happens more by accident when actually doing it.   Inflation, rather, is the issue.&nbsp; Something Kevin touches on gets to this point, and leads to a personal example.&nbsp; The prevailing atmosphere from students is as he described: in general, 70 percent (if not more) of the students believe they should have As....before they have even sat down for one lecture.&nbsp; There is a presumption that an A will follow, even for mediocre work.&nbsp; While, certainly, there will always be those students who think they should have an A, either from some (perhaps valid, perhaps not) high estimate of their own intelligence or some odd form of solipsistic narcissism, there are others for whom that is just the current standard.&nbsp; Or, in other words, what in decades past would receive a C (an average comprehension of the material) has now transformed into an A (average work awarded with excellence).&nbsp; Excellence has been relegated to the average.   The personal example - my first semester, I followed the lead of a professor of mine in undergraduate.&nbsp; He took attendance, not because it mattered for the grade, but for his own use.&nbsp; As he would say (paraphrasing, naturally): "I keep attendance for what happens after the midterm.&nbsp; If you don't do well, and I see you have been attending lecture each day, I can see it's just not coming to you naturally.&nbsp; So, I will work with you to get  a decent grade  for the semester.&nbsp; If you never attend, then I have no help for you - I'm not going to go over all the lectures again just for your benefit." [emphasis added]&nbsp; I said basically the same thing.&nbsp; And some students fell into that first category (bombed the midterm, but almost always attended lecture).&nbsp; So, I helped them to try and get  a decent grade , which in my mind would be&nbsp;a high C or a B.&nbsp; And so it went.&nbsp; And some of these students came back to me, with a mix of shock, sadness, and indignation, that I gave them less than an A.&nbsp; Because, apparently, the only thing that now counts as  a decent grade  is an A, even if one's skill or aptitude are no where near that designation.   I have restrained from using the term "decent" again.   And this&nbsp;presumption of an A&nbsp;is not harmless.&nbsp; Such a presumption of course will lead to increased mediocrity.&nbsp; As I mentioned, there is this question that irritates me no end: "What do I need to get a good grade?"&nbsp; Excellence is not the aim.&nbsp; Heck, even&nbsp;mere  comprehension  is not the aim.&nbsp; Just the concern for the basic minimum, the average, what should be a C (at best) but is now assumed an A.&nbsp; You can see, when teaching, just how the students are exceptionally well-trained at playing the system of the university lecture.&nbsp; I write on the board, merely to keep some of the discussion going.&nbsp; The words aren't necessarily of great importance, either in general or to all specific questions.&nbsp; But the students are expert at being parrots - anything written down will be regurgitated, even if the student has no idea what the word has to do with the logic being discussed (for various of my students, they are far too busy with the daily paper to be concerned about that).&nbsp; In my (admittedly thus far limited) experience, one can expect over half the students to be walking tape-recorders: record, rewind, replay.&nbsp; Their exams may have all the  words , but you can tell that the  meaning  is completely missing.   And for this, they will expect an A.   Some of my colleagues have said it is best to just concentrate on those students who  do  get it.&nbsp; It is our lot that many of the students will not give a damn about Aristotle, Plato, or what have you.&nbsp; Focus on the ones who do care.&nbsp; And they have a point.&nbsp; But whether it is idealism, pride, or just stubbornness, my blood boils when those who don't care then expect a high grade handed to them on a silver platter.   There is an atmosphere in academia (perhaps not everywhere, but certainly in many state schools) where this sort of expectation, just getting by and getting an A, is typical.&nbsp; And, naturally, it leads to the type of minimizing and satisficing mentioned before - if you are a student, and have the experience of As for lesser work, would you exert yourself too heavily?&nbsp; Does this mean that one must follow suit?&nbsp; Not necessarily, but there are many factors that are involved:     First  : To a certain extent, the students are not totally at fault.&nbsp; It is likely that their high school education, and a good share of their college education (at least in the liberal arts), always has followed this standard of "average as excellent."&nbsp; By years of experience, they have mastered the skill of the parrot and doing what is minimally needed, the quick filling and just as quick emptying of the mind, and have been rewarded for it.&nbsp; For many of them, trained in this way, standards of excellence would be quite a surprise, if not an alien experience.&nbsp; While holding them to a higher standard may awaken their minds, one wonders how many it would truly help.     Second  : Various other factors affect the students, and at times, it is hard to be the hard-ass one wants to be.&nbsp; As this type of "average is excellent" mentality has spread, institutions within and without the university have modified their measures.&nbsp; Scholarships, business resumes, entry into law school or other graduate programs....it is high competition.&nbsp; While for many of these, the standards have been (rightly so) high, now there is the factor of these institutions controlling for the grade inflation in the universities - a B doesn't mean what it used to.&nbsp; So, the professor as professor expects excellence from his/her students, and yet the professor as human being realizes that his/her standards are going to be much harsher than others, and that the students may suffer.&nbsp; If excellence is the only aim, this is not a concern; but if one wants their better students to succeed and become excellent in other fields, there is always the question of whether objective grading will prevent it.     Third  :&nbsp; One must also keep in mind the interests of the professor him/herself.&nbsp; Specifically, think about the professor evaluations.&nbsp; Now, if one is tenured, these are basically irrelevant (the evaluations could unanimously say that the professor is the reincarnation of Ivan the Terrible, but unless the professor is&nbsp;demanding sexual favors, channeling the ghost of Archie Bunker, sacrificing cats in lecture, or insulting religions other than Christianity, the evaluations are meaningless).&nbsp; But, for those of us not at academic paradise, the evaluations can be the factor that tips a borderline case for tenure either for or against.&nbsp; Here, one has to objectively evaluate one's self.&nbsp; So, in my case - I know I am not nearly the brightest or best scholar...heck, really anywhere.&nbsp; Unless my dissertation turns out, against all expectations, to be brilliant (and the magic eight-ball in my mind is coming up "sources say no"), I can't solely rely on that.&nbsp; Professional organizations, like the APSA, are pushing departments to hire more individuals that would increase "diversity"&nbsp;- I fall under none of the diverse classes.&nbsp; My research questions are somewhat pedantic, and tend to support not-terribly-popular positions (all that God talk in some political philosophies might have something to it; often siding with philosophical conservatives; etc.).&nbsp; Basically, for reasons of birth, lazy mind, political affiliation, and theological zealotry, I have done a good job of destroying my academic career before it has begun.&nbsp; I can use all the help I can get.&nbsp; Poor evaluations, which are more likely with more objective grading, will make things harder.&nbsp; So, the question becomes, do you want to be principled and perhaps in adjunct hell, or go with the spirit of the age and perhaps get a good position?   And this is the question.&nbsp; Is excellence in education, expecting more from the students than most will, worth the costs that might follow?   Yes.&nbsp; But it helps if you worry not for the morrow, sufficient unto itself are the concerns of today.

      The quote for the day was not completely random - indeed, it had a point.&nbsp; For I fear that east Texas, once again, may be on the verge of a Biblical plague.   Let me explain.&nbsp; In the summer before I started here (fall 2000), there were news reports of the Lone Star State being overrun with grasshoppers.&nbsp; Thousands of them.&nbsp; I remember the national newscast well - the reporter, with great self-control, walked through a field, explaining the situation, as every grasshopper in a thirteen-mile radius was using him as a jump-pad.&nbsp; This did not instill confidence about my new home.   But, it hasn't been as bad the last few years.&nbsp; But now, I'm not sure.&nbsp; The dread green/yellow insects lazily rest about on buildings, cars, people....anything.&nbsp; And you  hope  they rest.&nbsp; I am from the Midwest, where grasshoppers...well, hop.&nbsp; Not here.&nbsp; These winged beasts fly, and over long distances.   So that is where Ace comes in.&nbsp; Ace is a typical one of these behemoths, a yellow with green specks.&nbsp; And he flies.&nbsp; Not well, mind you - almost randomly.&nbsp; Imagine if Tom Cruise in   urlLink Top Gun   was suffering from a severe case of near-sightedness and alcohol poisoning while zooming around in his fighter.&nbsp; This would be close to Ace's style of flight.   The one thing that is consistent in Ace is what he likes.&nbsp; Perhaps reflecting serving in a previous life as a professor (which would explain why he/she is an insect now), Ace has an abiding love of sports jackets and ties.&nbsp; He flies at them.&nbsp; Wants to be close to them.&nbsp; Below the dreaded buzzing of his many wings, he is no doubt singing Barry White tunes to them.   This would be bad enough, if it were just Ace.&nbsp; But no - like any good fighter pilot, Ace has himself a squadron (or, perhaps better, the flight equivalent of "legion").&nbsp; And they follow Ace.&nbsp; And Ace follows humans.&nbsp; And humans follow their natural instincts - run like hell from the encroaching cloud of exoskeletons.   Ace even has outside allies, like Tail-Stinger Joe.&nbsp; TS Joe is a type of bee or wasp....but like all things in Texas, a wasp that is triple the size of any other found in the continental United States.&nbsp; And TS follows Ace as well.&nbsp; But while Ace is filled with  amor , TS is&nbsp;haunted by&nbsp; thanatos , the death instinct.&nbsp; But no passive death for TS - his flashbacks to the Great Orkin-Man Massacre of '01 come back to haunt him, and the urge to kill rises.&nbsp; And all humanity runs, and hides, and fears.   Why all of this?&nbsp; At first, I thought it was nature just doing what it does (and again, it  urlLink repulses  me).&nbsp; But no - there are too many.&nbsp; So, what does it mean?&nbsp; It may mean, I fear, that we in the Free Republic may have done something to anger the very order of Being, and this bodes not well.&nbsp; I have expect to see frogs, hail, and darkness to follow all this.   And if it does, there will be an email from this first-born son to his parents, simply say: "Mom & Dad:&nbsp; get lamb's blood RIGHT NOW."   The  horror .

      There will be various posts today, one dealing with Ace, Tail-Stinger Joe, and buzzing squadrons; another (much more serious) dealing with the issues of grading, teaching, and the idea of excellence; and finally, perhaps a random reading list.&nbsp; So, swing by this site about, oh, in an hour or two, and thereon after, and hopefully new wonderments and atrocities will await.   But, until then, make sure to take a look through our fine selection of links:   Over at the  urlLink Irish-Aggie News , Courtney talks about guilty pleasures [innocent ones - clean up your damn minds!], and the seventh circle of Hell.   Our man Paleface at  urlLink Orthos Logos  talks about the problems of hiding from danger by pointing fingers (or, as it always seems to me, some commission-focused attempt at retroactive divination).    urlLink Bizgirl , our favorite NZ librarian, has photos up of GWB as Will Smith (trippy, but funny) (yes, even conservatives can have a sense of humor!), but, more frightening, a picture of a man with biceps the size of my torso.&nbsp; The  whole  torso, like neck to waist.&nbsp; For those who miss the old carny freakshows, look and be amazed.   The Teaching Assistant, at the always interesting  urlLink Do Thy Research , gives us some insights on language fluency and iPod/other computer "fluency" programs (or, as I call them, the "devil's machines") - definitely worth a read.   For sundry other new and interesting blogs, give the  urlLink Showcase  a shot.   For those of a more political turn, definitely swing by the politics links (especially now, with the DNC convention)&nbsp;- and do make sure to give  urlLink the Greater Nomadic Council  a look.&nbsp; Mallarme is definitely writing about more than just politics, and is interesting for sundry reasons.&nbsp; Heck, just look at all the links.&nbsp; All are interesting.   I will point out two, though, of a newer variety.&nbsp; A ran into  urlLink One Good Bumblebee  through the  urlLink Texas Blogs  webring - seems literarily inclined, and quite random.&nbsp; So, naturally, I had to give it a link.&nbsp; Give it a look.&nbsp; And then, when looking for something completely diverting, there is  urlLink Martinis, Persistence, and a Smile  - a blog of the goings on of popular culture and so forth.&nbsp; Yes, not high culture by any stretch, but every once in a while, the mind desires to veg.   So, give them a look, and check back in a bit.&nbsp; It will be groovy.&nbsp; Hopefully.&nbsp; Humor me.

      I will get to the excellence post, part II (" ...this time, it's personal... ") in the morning, as well as some other random thoughts (specifically on the fear of a Biblical plague hitting east Texas, leading to emails involving lamb's blood).&nbsp; But, I figure for this evening, I will leave off on one political note, or perhaps civility note.   Over at  urlLink NRO , they have been paying a great deal of attention (naturally) to the DNC convention.&nbsp; While all are interesting, I found  urlLink this piece  by  urlLink Deroy Murdock  especially interesting.&nbsp; I did quote from the thing, but (once again) the "block quote" function made the page go wiggy (oy).&nbsp; But, the point at hand was the reaction to Mrs. Kerry's "shove it" line.&nbsp; That, I admit, I don't have a problem with.&nbsp; What she was avoiding, I do.&nbsp; She had talked about "un-American traits" slipping into US politics (gee, I wonder what she had in mind).&nbsp; And look at some of the responses (I especially liked Hilary's - nothing to increase civility in discourse like saying your opponents "worship power").  Yeah.&nbsp; "Un-American."&nbsp; "...believe in and worship power."&nbsp; And this does not even get into the speeches from Carter, Gore, Dean, Kennedy, and others (perhaps more on that later).&nbsp; Why do I bring this up?&nbsp; Just as a reminder.&nbsp; Next time one hears, say, a Clinton or the like talking about the "divisiveness," "lack of civility," "questioning of patriotism," or some such coming from the Republicans or conservatives, just remember how stunningly polite the other side is.   More later, true believers.&nbsp; You will hear of excellence.&nbsp; You will know the dread Ace.&nbsp; And it will be zen.&nbsp; Stay tuned.

      "So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts; they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again. They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail-everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt." --Exodus 10:13-15 (NIV version, located  urlLink here )

      That is the one problem (okay,  a  problem) with reading so many of the great thinkers of the past - you tend to expect too much of others.&nbsp; This is especially so when you are teaching.&nbsp; Excellence is a high good, indeed the highest good (depending upon who you ask).&nbsp; But not to your typical undergraduate upperclassmen.&nbsp; "Satisficing" seems to be their term of choice.   I do not wish to recall how many students I have talked to have asked what they need "to get a good grade."&nbsp; Wanting to know what borderline minimum is needed to do well.&nbsp; What a dreadful mix, where "minimum" and "well" are put together!   My usual temptation is to respond "you want a good grade?&nbsp; Delve into, understand, and comprehend the thinkers we read."&nbsp; But I don't bother - I know that these leaders of tomorrow don't want to do  that .&nbsp; Actually pay attention?&nbsp; Think about these thinkers?&nbsp; Perhaps even ( gasp ) give it some time????&nbsp; Horrors!&nbsp; No, they want the easy way out.&nbsp; Hard work?&nbsp; Dedication?&nbsp; Consideration of the good, the true, the beautiful?&nbsp; Naw....in our grand age of the degree-factory, they merely wish their A, their piece of paper, and to move on to whatever mindless occupation follows.   Perhaps I paid too little attention to my classmates in undergrad.&nbsp; Here I was under the illusion that learning was a good in itself, to be followed, to be loved.&nbsp; Apparently, I missed the point about what college  truly  aims at.   But, I should not be so rough on these types.&nbsp; The foibles of humanity are legion, and it is to be expected.&nbsp; But sometimes, while grading, and hearing students want excellence subsumed to "getting a good grade," I get rather infuriated.   Okay, I'm remembering why I told myself I would not blog while grading - the posts tend to be rants, and nobody wants that.&nbsp; Stay tuned tomorrow, true believers - the exams will be handed back then, and humor, happiness, and a general Zen feeling will follow.

      Yeah, the grading is going very well so far.&nbsp; So, another light day - must bite the bullet on this, and expect a deluge of students following.   Ah, the joys of teaching.   I keep thinking (hoping) how nice it would be to win the lotto, and, alone in my study, spending the days in conversations with the wise ones of old.   And then reality sinks in again, and the grading begins anew.   Sadly, Simon's  urlLink suggestion  is looking better and better right now....

      Well, it is now confirmed - there is no reasonable way to teach early political philosophy in five weeks.&nbsp; Grading has commenced, and it is taking much longer than expected.&nbsp; It is, indeed, going rather dreadfully.&nbsp; At times like this, I simply want to curl up with my research and avoid the interactions with humanity.   But alas, I must get paid.   So, it is wrestled through.&nbsp; However, I am half tempted to offer $50 to anyone willing (preferably able) to grade these exams.&nbsp; Terms are negotiable.

      Well, there is one other thing from Steve's post that I did want to mention.&nbsp; Specifically, on a word that becomes more irritating the more it is repeated.&nbsp; The line is this: " Johnson is also an admired historian (admired, that is, by neo-con ideologues such as those at the New Criterion) ."   Some disclosure&nbsp;- I rather enjoy  The New Criterion .&nbsp; Certainly seems of a higher quality than most the pap that passes as literary criticism these days.&nbsp; But, that probably showed (in my earlier post  urlLink on taste , I mentioned the new book by  The New Criterion 's managing editor, Roger Kimball).&nbsp; But, that's not my area of concern.   "...neo-con ideologues..."&nbsp; Neo-con, short for neoconservative.&nbsp; "Neoconservative" started out as a term of abuse (used by liberals against those who jumped ship, like Irving Kristol and others), then was taken as a name for a certain type of conservatism (by Kristol, William Bennett, and sundry others), and now has come full circle back to a term of abuse.&nbsp; For what, I have no idea.   Let me put it straight out - "neoconservative" is, in many ways, a meaningless word, and continues to lose meaning each time the word is recited.&nbsp; I have  urlLink mentioned before  the dreadful uses of this word (especially as it seemed to be a code-word for "Straussian-influenced conservative Jew," insinuating stock-villain cabals out of the  Elders of Zion ), but now it has gone on to incoherence.   I am a conservative, more of the mainstream variety, with some leanings toward theoconservatism (another word made as a term of abuse).&nbsp; I enjoy  The New Criterion , and heck, even read  The Weekly Standard  sometimes.&nbsp; Am I, therefore, a "neo-con ideologue"?&nbsp; I supported the war in Iraq, and I still do.&nbsp; Does that make me a "neo-con ideologue"?&nbsp; I am a conservative - does  that  make me a ""neo-con ideologue"?   So, it comes to this question - what&nbsp; is  a neoconservative?&nbsp; Can anyone give some type of definition?&nbsp; Probably the best attempt I've seen was done  urlLink Jonah Goldberg  of  urlLink NRO  (in his own style, naturally) in a collection of three&nbsp;columns ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ).&nbsp; By going over the genealogy of this term, he illustrates just how worthless it is for contemporary discussion.&nbsp; I tend to see it being partially useful (but even then, only partially) in describing the movement in the United States by some leftists to the right (getting "mugged by reality," in Kristol's phrase) over the middle/late middle part of the twentieth century.&nbsp; That's about it.   But, let's consider what neo-con seems to mean now.&nbsp; It appears to have fallen into the same linguistic trap that  urlLink Orwell warned of  in his "Politics and the English Language": "The word  Fascism  has now no meaning in so far as it signifies 'something not desirable.'"&nbsp; Consider the example - a fascist is a radical nationalist, where all spheres and elements of society (individual, religion, economy, etc.) are subservient to the state, it usually entails a large and centralized government, and sundry other matters.&nbsp; Clearly, not pleasant people.&nbsp; And yet, how many times have I heard a supporter for limited government called a "fascist"!&nbsp; It would be like shouting down Howard Zinn as a "running-dog capitalist" - incoherent.   So too comes the fate of "neoconservative."&nbsp; No one seems to have any idea what the term means, but it is good enough - to say someone is "neocon" can communicate so many different ideas (imperialist, warmonger, money-driven, Cheney, "compassionate conservative," Wolfowitcz, religious nut, etc.) without having to put them together in any straightforward sense.&nbsp; It is a term of abuse, and seems to be little more now.

      Once again, I do thank Steve over at  urlLink splinters  for the attention to this blog, though it does confuse me.&nbsp; Why a  urlLink webmagazine  of the UK, which I assume is doing well enough, would spend one post (much less two) on&nbsp;this blog, with a regular readership of about twelve, surprises me.   Don't get me wrong - I'm happy about that.&nbsp; The readership used to be around seven, and only increased more recently.&nbsp; Now, with the splinter folks, who knows?&nbsp; Maybe it will reach fifteen, and life, the universe, and everything will be groovy.   Anyway, to the point at hand.&nbsp; Steve has  urlLink responded  to my comments, more or less, so I wager I will do the same.&nbsp; What the heck?&nbsp; It beats grading exams.   Now, one minor little thing.&nbsp; For some reason, Steve first mentioned this blog with the spelling "gray" (which, as anyone who notices the big banner at the top can see, is correct) to the spelling "grey."&nbsp; Both are correct spellings of the word, and I'll chalk it up to his blogging early in the morning for the error in terms of this blog's title.   But now, to substance.&nbsp; Obviously, Steve and I have rather different reads on Johnson, as well as others.&nbsp; As Steve puts it:     Well, the main reason is because Paul Johnson is precisely an intellectual aligning himself with a reign of terror. It is clear from that one quotation that he can't see how his own critique applies to himself above all. For instance, he denounces Chomsky&nbsp;for pointing out what happens in practice as US foreign policy spreads that wonderful idea freedom. Johnson ignores what happens to real people as a result with the   urlLink  insouciance    of a practiced apologist of tyranny.     (the link, from the original text, is from an article on the notion of empire/imperialism Johnson wrote in   urlLink The New Criterion  )   &nbsp;  Well, I wager we need to break this down.&nbsp; The first thing I would suggest is that the reader take a look at the article linked to.&nbsp; I admit, I'm not sure if I completely follow with Johnson's take on this, but it is certainly reasoned, and not as radical as Steve seems to want to portray.&nbsp; We seem run into, once again, high rhetoric with little backing.&nbsp; "...an intellectual aligning himself with a reign of terror", "...a practiced apologist of tyranny" -&nbsp;big statements.&nbsp; What tyranny, pray tell, is he aligning with?&nbsp; The one that puts dissidents through plastic cutters and sends the wife to a rape room before being shot?&nbsp; Oh, wait....guess not.&nbsp; And what of the United States?&nbsp; Oh, yes, dissent has been crushed, and the country has become silent....well, unless you are holding a huge ANSWER rally, are touting the deep thinking in Moore's recent mockumentry (which, in great nuance, explains how Bush is a Machiavellian boob, an antichrist for the secular Endtime), or, heck, even&nbsp;buy books at the&nbsp; urlLink National Archives bookstore .&nbsp; What a velvet tyranny Johnson supports!&nbsp;&nbsp;Fooling the population into  thinking  they are free when, well, exercising their freedom.

As for me, I'm now off to call my solicitor.  No doubt, an Umbrae Canarum Legal Fund link will appear soon, and I thank you for your support.  Just kidding.    I hope.

      Originally, I planned on continuing on the line regarding  urlLink conversation , keeping in mind the comments from  urlLink Mallarme  and  urlLink Chris  (perhaps also the Teaching Assistant).  But, unfortunately, that will not happen today.  There is something else to discuss, that does relate, but in a more negative way.  Some background.  There is a mini-conference going on in my department, and one of my good friends, Wisconsin Guy, was involved in keeping things together.  So, after it's done, I meet him at the  urlLink BoC  for a drink and some relaxation.  But, when I arrive, I discover that we may be moving on.  Two other colleagues, who in rather frightening ways come across as two  Saturday Night Live  skits mixed together (the two "vild und crazy guys!" a la earlier  SNL , and the "evening at the Roxbury" skits of later) (yeah, be afraid), apparently were meeting with some of the visiting professors at the more undergrad bars in the legendary Northgate.  So, we decided to go.  Naturally, our two associates had....exaggerated, to say the least, leading us to take only one prof there (who could be easily persuaded).  Our associates are dangerously close to getting the working title "the idiot brothers."  Anyway, so we're at this undergrad bar, a new one, called Logan's.  It was, no doubt, one of the more dreadful experiences in a dreadful month.  There is no conversation at these types of places.  Between blaring music and drunkards' yells, all sound merges together into this undifferentiated, droning monotone, broken only by the occasional "  HI!!!!!!!!!!  " or loud obscenity.  How anyone could get to know others...hell, even barely communicate with them, was inconceivable to me.  That is, until, it became more crowded.  In places like this, the style of interaction takes on a different form.  Sadly, it's not really a human form,  per se  - rather, it looks like some combination of bees "dancing" in a hive mixed in with the rutting of some overly-excited wildebeest.  You think I jest.  I do not.  Indeed, perhaps it is the only way these folks could "discuss," and get to what they were aiming to communicate.  The place is packed.  No elbow misses a back, no foot another's heel, no shoulder an arm holding a beer.  If a plane or a bus is this packed, these folks would find it frustrating.  But, in a bar, it is somehow transformed into "fun."  Again, the voices are all merged and mixed, with no words reaching from one's lips to another's ears without severe effort.  So, the mass is made use of, mostly by the ladies.  It is the "dance."  This dance has great similarity to those by the bees.  The hive is loud with buzzing, and all are cramped together - so, if one wants to communicate the direction of flowers, it shakes its lower body in a certain time and sequence for the others.  So too in the bar - usually a woman, she will shake her hips (among other parts, at points), but not to direct the others elsewhere, but apparently to her.  This is where the wildebeest come in.  Coming up like a stalking wolf, this fellow (usually sporting a ballcap, jeans, and a T-Shirt that is rumpled, but in just the right way) will come up to the dancing woman, and start....well, I fail to find words that can describe it, for a family-friendly blog, in any case.  Rather than surprise, the woman simply modifies the dance to accommodate the undulations of the fellow (who apparently has never been told "rent a room, dammit!").  I see this behavior, and realize that, even in my dear and backward state of Texas,  urlLink the gentleman's dead .  But for those who want to hear, for those who desire conversation, who detest being packed in a room and watching men and women acting more like animals, all one can do is try and step back.  Standing alone, hearing hundreds of voices but not a single word and watching this mass of humanity that takes "let's get drunk and screw" as a life motto, the thinker cringes.  These are the future business leaders, future politicians, future parents,  the  future.  And whether the words that come to mind are Tocqueville's "democratic despotism," Plato's democratic anarchy, the lonely crowd, the isolated self, decadence and decline, or what have you, the mass seems to beg your heart to have sorrow for them.  But you feel nothing....you just can't bring yourself to care about them enough, and perhaps not even about the world that they represent.  So you stand alone in the bar, and wait to get out.  Wait to find conversation, even if it requires talking to the dead through the words they've written.  Between the dead and the decayed, the dead are better conversationalists.

      Over at  urlLink the Greater Nomadic Council , Mallarme has some  urlLink very enlightening comments  on the place of conversation, and indeed looks like he may have found an answer to some of my pessimism  urlLink at the end of my discourse post . No doubt more will follow, but read on, and hopefully the conversation will continue soon...

      Was just taking a look at Instapundit, and saw this  urlLink insult to civilization  - at two a.m. New Zealand time, somewhere between 80-100 Jewish graves were vandalized. The headstones pushed over, and the chapel set on fire, these despicable villains have certainly made their point clearly. Alas, it seems the increasing anti-Semitism of the Western world has now reached the fair island of NZ.  This may appear as me harping. Perhaps it is. But I'll also be honest with you - I see these things, and I worry. If they were isolated incidents, with no connection to the society around them, I would assume it merely to be the particular acts of ne'er-do-wells who will, sooner or later, get to spend a great deal of luxury time in their respective nations' correctional facilities. But they are not isolated, in that the atmosphere is poisoned.  I'll admit, I'm a supporter of Israel. That doesn't mean I toss aside all critiques of it - being in what is for all intents and purposes a nearly 60 year civil war leaves no hands clean. But, I am in academia....and in many parts of it, anti-Zionism tends to blur into a new, and frightening, anti-Semitism. This combines with insane conspiracy theories. Have you ever heard of ZOG? It stands for "Zionist Occupation Government" - it's what some of the psychotic backwater survivalists in this country thought they faced: a Zionist U.S. government, awaiting UN invasion any day. Loony, to say the least.  Sadly, it spreads. Not just weekend warriors who took a  really  wrong turn follow this line of thought - consider the use and abuse of "neoconservative" - a group of dastardly Wilsonian  realpolitik  (hey, conspiracies have problems with consistency sometimes) Jewish conservatives playing the President for a puppet in the interests of Israel. These aren't the radical racist nutboy militias now....sadly, sometimes these are the more radical professors in Europe and the U.S., the ones who cloak themselves in "accepting difference" and the like.  So, yes, I do harp on this. And will continue to harp on this. The Jewish people are the Christians' elder brothers and sisters. The Jewish people have suffered greatly already - it was during the years of my grandfathers when the madness of the twentieth century occurred. Never again, indeed - never again should we allow the libels against the Jews to go uncontested, or violence against them unavenged. Whether the threat is from Nazi race theory, Islamo-fascism, or a totalitarian egalitarianism, anti-Semitism must always be fought.

      In the coming hours, a review for Collected Miscellany, and no doubt something else. It's been a long week - but it will be something.  But, while waiting, please again give our fine collection of links a look. There are a few new ones I've added recently, and are worth investigating:  -- urlLink Californian Sojourn  has been giving me quite a bit of reading enjoyment, and hopefully will for you too.  --For those interested in the academic side of things, check out  urlLink Heading Out  and  urlLink Just Tenured  (thanks to the Teaching Assistant at  urlLink Do Thy Research  - that's where these ones came to my attention) - high discussion at ease....like a good B&amp;B for the mind.  --For those masochists called political junkies, there is a twelve step program. But for those of you who "don't have a problem can quit whenever I want," I'm with you, and offer some new (some tried-and-true) links. There is  urlLink Blackfive  and  urlLink Target Centermass  (they both tend to focus more on military matters), as well as two on the groovy Texas webring with this site,  urlLink INCITE  and  urlLink The Swanky Conservative .  --Looking for something a little more artistic? Give  urlLink Instapoet  a try (from the fellow that brought you  urlLink Seldom Sober ).  Should keep you busy. More to come...

      Thanks again to  urlLink Andrew  for  urlLink his response  (in the comments section). As I promised to avoid making this, well, more of, a political blog, I will leave the comments (with my own addition) as they stand.  But, I did want to mention one thing, and unfortunately this will highlight my dreadful cynicism. Andrew says, " You are part of the (insert scary music) intellectual elite. That dastardly group of people who aren't easily swept in by flag waving and pretty high alert colors. Those pinko commies who actually exhibit critical thinking and read every once in a while. "  Sadly, I can't necessarily disagree about the "pinko commie" part, but "...actually exhibit critical thinking..."? That's touching, but alas, going to one or two professional conferences illustrates very well that critical thinking isn't exactly a strong point of the intelligentsia either. Admittedly, there is much talk of critical thinking, but it tends to be thinking critically....just like everyone else.

      Sorry the last post's text is a bit small - it was either that and a normal looking page, or have the text normal and the sidebar shoved down to the bottom of the screen. Hope it is not a major inconvenience.  That's probably all for today. Tomorrow, expect a new review to be up at  urlLink Collected Miscellany  (the book, and the style, you'll just have to wait for). And, on that topic, my CM boss, Kevin, has  urlLink a piece  in NRO today, so give that a look too.  As for today, I'm outta here. More tomorrow, true believers. Excelsior!

       Now to something different. But first, a little background. I was sitting in my   urlLink  BoC    having a   urlLink  Boch    last night, relaxing from lecture-writing, and enjoying a leisurely read. There are TVs in the place, as is typical. Usually, they're tuned to   urlLink  ESPN    or   urlLink  FOX Sports   , for watching games and the like. But every once in a while, one of the TVs is tuned to   urlLink  CNN    or   urlLink  FOX News   ...but as with the other TVs, this news one is on mute. So, you can watch Wolf Blitzer or Brit Hume talking at you, but hear nothing they're saying. Last night was FOX News, and looking up, I see a trippy duo on the screen.  It is the   urlLink  O'Reilly Factor   , with Bill O'Reilly versus Garrison Keillor. O'Reilly needs no introduction, really....I try to avoid watching him. Directed more by his enormous sense of self-importance rather than some higher goal, he tends to make me cringe (as in "please don't support my position - we  really really  don't need that kind of help, thank you all the same"). Keillor, however, may need some introduction. If you catch NPR on the weekend, you no doubt have heard him - he is the melodious voice leading the way of   urlLink A Prairie Home Companion  , a trippy little variety show on the radio. But his politics are certainly not O'Reilly's (for a less-than-positive rendition of these views, look   urlLink  here   ; or, give Keillor's   urlLink  new book    a look).  Anyway, these two were going at it last night...on mute...and, sadly, I wagered I hadn't missed much. Between Bill's spouting off and Garrison's suave pretensiousness, I doubt any true wisdom came of it. At about this very moment, I came across the lines that make up   urlLink  today's random quote   . And Barzun is on to something - what are we to expect from timed, limited, and narrow discussions on the television? Can we expect a serious, and deep, dialogue on any issue that will serendipitously end when a commercial break is required? Or is it more like what one anticipates in a  WWE  match - a choreographed conflict, with its ups-and-downs, its upsets and sure-things, always completed just in time for this message from "Old Spice"?  Perhaps it is no big thing. And yet, these are the types of shows that are (supposedly) "smart" television. Get away from O'Reilly - think of any other roundtable style program. If it does not degenerate into a shouting match, filled with the quick soundbite tidbits, the sheer lack of time prevents anything more than a superficial consideration of the ideas on the table. Can deep thinking, can true understanding, come from this sort of thing?  Time for a thought experiment. Let us go back to the past, but with a difference. What if ancient Greece had television?   PLATO : "Now that the war is over, and democracy is restored in Athens, the question for today is, what should be done? Let's ask today's guests."   CEPHALUS : "A no-brainer, young man. Simply tell the truth and pay one's debts."   SOCRATES : "It appears, my friend, that you're talking about what is just. But, let us consider what justice is. Now, on paying one's debts..."   THRASYMACHUS : "Great, here we go..."   SOCRATES : "Have some patience, my sophist friend. Now, as I was saying, if we consider the example of a friend gone mad..."   THRASYMACHUS : "Oh come on! Get to the point or drop it, old man!"   PLATO : "Thrasymachus, rebuttal?"   THRASYMACHUS : "Damn right, 'rebuttal.' Justice is merely the interest of the stronger. Quick, simple, applicable anywhere. Next question."   SOCRATES : "Surely we can't leave it at that. Let us talk about what this means..."   PLATO : "Socrates, rebuttal? Ten seconds."   SOCRATES : "You can't be serious. We're talking about justice, here! I can't just summarize it in some bite-sized little..."   PLATO : "Hold that thought. When we come back, we'll have more on justice and the  polis . You're watching  Academy Live ."   {exit music...Plato turns to Socrates}    PLATO : "Socrates, listen, you need to pick up the pace here. It looks like you're hedging. We need something clear and concise."   SOCRATES : "But, my friend, I have never given the impression that I'm wise. I don't know the definition of 'justice.' Therefore, we need to talk it through. These types of things take time, consideration, and true give and take, in a conversation, to reveal truth."   PLATO : "Listen - I'm in a ratings war with Xenophon right now, thanks to you. This ain't no dinner party."   SOCRATES : "Hey, the last time I tried to keep it simple was talking with that damn director Aristophanes, and you saw what happened with  that . I swear that play will be the death of me yet..."  The medium itself does not lend to real conversation. Only superficiality.  Is there an avenue for the type of conversation that truly is enlightening? I don't know. Especially now, it seems often more the result of dumb luck (or divine providence, depending on your view) that a discussion can come about among the learned, concerned for the good, the true, the beautiful. In previous centuries, where literacy was lacing for many, perhaps these types of dialogues came about more easily, since the number actually able to discuss in an educated way was smaller. Now, we are almost all to a person half-educated, trying to speak the same way, or have chattering pundits speak for us.  But therein lies the problem. What appears to be the avenue for true intellectual discussion seems destroyed by increased literacy and education. There is no way to go back to before. Indeed, I doubt few if any of us would  want  to go back to such a time. So what now? Perhaps, as time goes on, those who are in love with the Intellect (as Barzun would define it) will find ways. What those ways would be, my imagination is lacking.

      Again, I thank  urlLink Seldom Sober  for getting me more hits yesterday than I ever thought possible. It was nice to see the variety of folks coming by to this little site. And I also want to thank Andrew over at  urlLink The Scamboogah Daily Rag  for spending a couple minutes in retort. As said here before, no publicity is bad publicity.  But, to the issue at hand. Thankfully, Andrew's  urlLink argument  (such as it is) has made this rather simple for me, so I will try to go easy.  Andrew starts out with the following:     I just have to ask the right wing something. Do you have any legitimate criticisms about Michael Moore other than 'Ha ha, he's fat'?     My mistake. I'm sorry that we on the right have not dedicated ourselves to writing such civility-filled, policy-oriented, and fact-heavy tomes as   urlLink Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot  ,   urlLink Stupid White Men...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation!  , among others. Silly me - I forgot that "legitimate criticisms" are when leftists call rightists fat fools, but not the other way around. My error - forgot the rules of the game.  I wager Andrew did not find my little jokes that funny. Fair enough - humor's never been my strong point. So, we stick to the substance.  But, then again, sticking to the substance is a bit of a trick - looking through Andrew's description of my post, I rather wonder if he read through it terribly carefully. Indeed, he seems to see his own concerns and boogeymen in it rather than mine. He mentions, for instance, that I " ...attempt to portray Michael Moore as a bigoted, wealthy liar along the same lines as, say, Dick Cheney... "  I did?  Well, let's leave Dick out of this for the moment, and look at the three word description: "bigoted, wealthy liar." Indeed, I call him each of these things, but Andrew's explication on the matter reveals that what he thinks these three things describe, and how my post annunciated them, are rather different.  I wager that, if he sees me trying to compare Moore to what is the image in Andrew's mind of Cheney, this is what Andrew means: I am trying to make Moore into a racist, plutocratic, liar (liar will be adressed more below).  That is mistaken.  I'm trying to show more as prejudiced (by region), contradictory (via wealth) liar.  So, let us see what this means.  " Bigoted ." I certainly called Moore that, and stick by it. He is a bigot - he has caricatured an entire subpopulation of the US in such an offensive manner (namely, we nitwit rednecks in the flyover country) that, again, most would not tolerate such slander. And, as I mentioned, for another portion of the population (usually located on the golden coasts, with the like-minded who, by some punishment from God, have been stuck in goober territory) share this bigotry with Mr. Moore. Interestingly, Andrew makes absolutely no mention of this. He mentions "racist" a lot, but that's something I did not accuse Moore of - "racist" came into my post regarding how Moore sees this plebian desert, as a land of proto-racists. Apparently, when Andrew saw the term "bigot," he went into ideational auto-pilot (in a critically reflective way, of course) and simply assumed that I was labeling Moore a racist. Interesting.  " Wealthy ." As a matter of empirical knowledge, this is true. While Moore seems to think that washing his ball-cap is some crime against geometry and religion, his movies and books have profited him enough to be worth his weight in gold. For Andrew's sake, I'll refrain from the obvious following sentence [ for all others - insert joke about "GDP of Third World Nation" here ]. I mentioned this as simply being a matter of contradiction within Moore's style of presenting himself. It is hard to be an egalitarian, sharing in the suffering of the common man, while at the same time being worth more in dollar terms than many of the dread capitalists Moore belittles. Andrew, unsurprisingly, leaves this to the side as well. I guess if you have been spoon-fed good "critically-minded" progressivist information for years, one learns to ignore contradiction in one's heroes. Heck, it's better than having to actually work through them.  " Liar ." I did call Moore that, but mostly left it to the side. The major reason for this was that I had (and have) little to add on that side. Moore's....unique....understanding of factual evidence has lead to an entire cottage industry of Moore fact-checkers, and I certainly can't beat them. I simply wanted to focus on what a prejudiced individual Mikey is, and so I did. If Andrew, or others, would like to see some critique of Moore (other than the oh-so-easy fat jokes) (c'mon, you have to laugh - a three-hundred pound layabout "feeling the pain" of the subsistence wage worker?  That  is HIGH-larious), you can always go to  urlLink Moorewatch ,  urlLink Moorelies.com , scan/search through the websites of   urlLink National Review  ,   urlLink The Weekly Standard  , or   urlLink The Wall Street Journal  , read   urlLink Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man  , or wait for the release of   urlLink Michael Moore Hates America  . With that level of competition, I wager I have nothing worthwhile to add on that score. I assume that the legitimate criticisms Andrew's looking for can be found there. If he's willing to look.  I must mention one last thing: Andrew, almost from nowhere, mentions war record comparisons between Kerry and Bush. Now, I will give Andrew that some of been going after Kerry's war record. Most of the mainstream conservative journals (like  NR  and  Weekly Standard ) have avoided this, indeed saying that a war record is laudable. What they  do  attack, and quite rightly, is what Kerry did when he got back: you know, that whole accusing his "band of brothers" of being barbarian-like war criminals. Again, contradiction - Kerry magnifies his service in Vietnam, while at the same time not addressing calling fellow soldiers sadists. If memory serves, Kerry made that presentation before a Senate committee. Funny - between that little incident, and Kerry's less-than-moderate voting record, the dear candidate seems to want to pretend he's never been in the Senate hall. If the right's attacks on Moore are analogous to those against Kerry, than I say, "carry on, lads!" Both fellows live in contradictions, and cannot stand having them brought out. Bring them out.  Let the fun begin.

      My deepest thanks to  urlLink Seldom Sober , for granting me a link in his presentation of the  urlLink Carnival of the Vanities  (#98). Increased hits = happiness (if only Aristotle had known the internet...). A child shall be named after him....probably not one of mine (doubt a future Mrs. would dig "Seldom" for a son's name), but some child.  Sooooo....to all newcomers, welcome. Hope the post was enjoyable. Please feel free to look about the blog - whether you want  urlLink the dynamics of the blogosphere ,  urlLink David Lynch and the problem of evil ,  urlLink the two types of actors ,  urlLink the gentleman today ,  urlLink matters of taste ,  urlLink technology and its discontents , or  urlLink titanic battles with palmetto bugs  (among sundry others), you will find it here. Yes, this is the Internet Ed Sullivan Variety Show.  Enjoy. More to come....   UPDATE : Seeing the traffic as it is, I wager I'll just leave this post up, and not add anything new until tomorrow. What the topic will be, I have no idea - might be the jacuzzi atmosphere of East Texas, the connection between modernity and death, or the neurotic worries of lecturers. Guess we'll see. But did want to also thank  urlLink Californian Sojourn  for  urlLink the nice mention  of this site. Stay tuned...

       May 2006, "Larry King Live"    KING : "Welcome back. We're talking with Phil, a director of a new film called  It Came From Flint . Tell us a little about it."   PHIL : "Thanks, Larry. This is a documentary meant to inform the American people about the character and dangers they face from Michael Moore. There are startling revelations that they should know. So, for instance, the film delves into how Moore sent encoded messages in his film  F911  to Hezbollah, detailing aspects of the US economy."   KING : "Frightening."   PHIL : "Indeed. Now, I've told you about some of the more political elements before, but there are other issues. So, in my investigation, I found out that Moore and Michael Jackson stayed in the same swank Paris hotel room - I'm planning on trying to find any young boys spotted in the vicinity. And then there is physical threat from Moore. The combined density of his body and his ego are yanking comets and small planetoids dangerously out of orbit. The fate of the very planet hangs on the truth."   KING : "Let's go to the phones. Manhattan, you're on the air."   CALLER : "Yeah, this is Michael Moore. What the hell is that jackass talking about?"   PHIL : "C'mon, Mike - Larry isn't that bad."   KING : "Thank you. I mean...what did you say...?"   MOORE : "What do you think you're doing??? This is all nonsense! Yes,  urlLink Hezbollah supported my film  - that was their choice, nothing  I  chose. You're pulling this junk out of your..."   KING : "Michael, the FCC...."   MOORE : "And this other stuff! Yeah, Jackson and I had the same hotel room in Paris... four years apart ! And the physicists have no...er,  conclusive  proof that my ego has ANYTHING to do with SR8675309 plummeting toward Earth!!!!"   PHIL : "Jeez, Mikey, take it easy. It's for laughs. What, is 'satire' to complex a notion for you?"   MOORE : "Satire? What the..."   PHIL : "Oh, I see how it is. Big Media guy is trying to crush dissent. This is what's wrong in America today, Larry - the freedom to speak truth to power is gone, suppressed by the unscrupulous media powers in this country."   MOORE : "BUT YOU'RE TWISTING THE FACTS!!!"   PHIL : "You're questioning my patriotism now? Is that it, Mikey? Any criticism now is  verboten ? Shall we be sending directors to re-education camps now, is that what you're saying?"   MOORE : "But I..."   PHIL : "...next thing you know, all our freedoms will be gone. They'll be opening gulags in Montana. This is exactly the kind of chilling effect I've been talking about, Larry."   MOORE : "But I..."   KING : "Sorry, Michael; we have to move on. St. Paul, Minnesota...."  Yes, this was all overdone satire, turning the tables on Moore. And it reveals nothing new - it is well established by various sources (here's just one  urlLink watchdog site ) that Moore has...problems with facts. He likes using them in the same way an artisan of origami uses paper. He will start out talking about his "documentary," then when called out on the anomalies, fall into claiming it's all just comedy. When the attack continues, somehow a critique of Moore equates with the stifling of dissent, and indeed such critique somehow implies Moore's patriotism is being questioned. This irritating two-faced nature is nothing new. But I have a different complaint with Moore, one that I couldn't quite put my finger on until just recently.  Michael Moore is a bigot.  Not a typical bigot, mind you. Or perhaps too typical - better, perhaps, to say he is not a "stereotypical" bigot. No, he plays on, and reaps the rewards of, the bigotries of what might describe itself as "the sophisticated" part of the population [  NOTE : "sophisticated" does not mean just anybody who went to see Moore's films - the type of person I have in mind is specified below ].  So, allow me to explain (if you've made it this far). I have no intention of seeing  F911 . About a month ago, I watched all but a few minutes of  Roger and Me , and also as much as I could tolerate of  Bowling for Columbine . And I was amazed that so many found his shtick about being a common man so convincing, even though he must be one of the most dedicated elitists I've seen. Makes it all the more interesting that this elitist wraps himself in egalitarian garb.   Columbine  was the film that really drove it home. This amazingly jaundiced view of a large swath of the country stunned me. What, basically, does Moore present? That between the golden shores of the east and west coasts is a plebian desert, a desert populated by fools filled with a false consciousness, that are Bible-beating, fear-filled, belligerent, ignorant, proto-racist nitwits. And that's his nuance-filled view of the matter.  Consider some of the major points in  Columbine  (leaving to the side the dreadful flights from fact Moore displays): why are there so many guns? Because the American people (read: the plebian desert) are intrinsically fearful, playing off and magnifying their own unfounded fears...oh, expect when they  do  look for a focal point, in which case it is the fear of the black man.  Yeah.  Oh, Moore is quite right. I remember, back as a younger man in Indiana, where all the neighborhood would stockpile firearms of all kinds. We had good reason to - we'd all seen  Red Dawn , and dammit we weren't gonna let no Ruskies invade awr fields! Sure, the Soviets had fallen by then, but we weren't fooled none! We knew the invasion was comin'. Someday. Somewhere. Heck, if it weren't the Ruskies, it's be the Zionists runnin' America for the Israelis...oh, sorry, my mistake. We never thought that. I just accidentally channeled a Frenchman, or Noam Chomsky.  Moore could at least have done us all a favor and played it out straight-forwardly:  "Why do I have guns? 'Cause it's a dangerous world, big man. Survival of the fittest. Or, at least, that's how it should be. Aw, hell, big man. I can't lie to you. I just wanna go kill me some black people. Even though my great great grand-daddy fought for the Union, and though I have nothing against any race, I just wanna kill'em. Dunno why. But hell, big man, I don't need no reason. YeeeeeeHAW! The South  shall  rise again!  [wife, from the other room: "But dear, we live in South Dakota"]  Dammit, woman, make me a sandwich! {grunt}."   C'mon, Mikey - you know you wanted to.  But to the point, Moore has managed to caricature a big portion of the US in such an offensive way that most groups wouldn't take it. And yet, for the great fly-over country states, we've come to expect it. Moore simply plays off the prejudices of the sophisticated, who indeed are  so  sophisticated they feel no need for self-criticism any more. Who needs self-reflection when you have moral superiority?  But then again, Moore and his die-hard audience are made for each other. After all, both are riddled with contradictions:  Moore - his shtick is against capitalism and global corporate greed, and yet he has used both to market and promote his film across the world; he portrays the part of the little guy, while his film has grossed over  urlLink $109 million to date ; he speaks for the common man, and yet, very few common men live on the Upper West Side (well, I guess there is always his doorman...); his films address "higher truths," while remaining very ambiguous on concrete facts; he espouses concern for the downtrodden, but one wonders whether he would sacrifice appetizer #3 for a week to support a needy family.  Sophisticates - they pride themselves on their tolerance, and yet cannot abide anyone deviating slightly from the herd; they consider themselves highly self-critical, and yet rarely if ever come across people with different views; while picturing themselves as thinking through life, they exhibit prejudices older than the Civil War; they look smugly at the fundamentalist NASCAR backwater layabouts, while following every artistic/political/social fashion religiously; they support the welfare state, and yet won't support any charity that lacks a celebrity spokesperson.  Indeed, both Moore and the sophisticates must be quite bright - you have to be either excessively intelligent or monumentally stupid to let such incoherence go unquestioned. But, I shant be joining them. Bigotry against one's countrymen may be high entertainment for the flappers and the philosophers, but for we hicks in the no-man's land, I prefer not to laugh at my American brethren, much less one-dimensional imitations of them.  [ P.S. My thanks to Rob Long of National Review for the inspiration on the Larry King motif.  Long does it much better. ]

      I must admit, the last few weeks, heck the last month, have been less than spiffy. Especially the last two weeks have been filled with a continuing, and odd, mix of emotions - some combination of constant simmering rage, with frustration and societal annoyance mixed in. So, in other words, not nifty.  Soooooooooo.....I have decided to do something about it, at least something quick. My next post will be quite bleem filled, and quite political (although I assure you, at a deserving target). I do not intend to make this blog one of those political ones - its a saturated field, and no point of getting into it. Political theory, sure; politics, no. But, one last one for a while (if all goes according to plan), for a little  catharsis , and then hopefully will have it all out of my system, and be a wee bit....well, I guess this is never really "happy-go-lucky." Status quo - that's what we'll aim for. Anyway, just as fair warning. More to follow...

      "Demonstrators waiting, bearded men and bra-less girls poised to emit their shrill cries, placards grounded, police standing by, their van discreetly parked, one or two journalists looking at their watches and thinking of editions.  Everyone waiting.  When, oh when, will they come?  At last, patience rewarded; the cameras arrive and are set up.  Sound-recordist ready, cameraman ready.  Action!  And lo! magically action it is.  Beards wag, breasts shakes, placards lift, fists clench, slogans chant, police charge, van loads.  Screaming, yelling--Pigs!  Until--Cut!  All is over.  Slogans die away, beards and breasts subside, cops and vans drive off.  All depart, leaving the street silent.  From Action! to Cut!--oh, death wish, where is thy sting?" --Malcolm Muggeridge, "The Great Liberal Death Wish" (in   urlLink The Portable Conservative Reader  ).

      First, a little randomness. Probably the next few days will have little coherence to them { "and this is different, how...?" saith the audience }, probably a bit here and there, and who knows, maybe even some poetry { as the audience begins to delete this web address }. But, hopefully it will be interesting. Before I forget, though - make sure to give a look at  urlLink this quiz , on the topic of "What Kind of Elitist Are You?" I ended up getting the same elitist type as  urlLink the Teaching Assistant . Personally, I was hoping for "old-school aristocrat," but I don't think the quiz had such a category. Pity.  As another random note,  urlLink Bookslut  informs us that  urlLink Amazon.com  will be making the review process a little more stringent. Another pity. As Jessa  urlLink says , " My only fear is that fewer junior high and high school students will be able to grace us with genius such as this: "SUCK BIG BANANAS.... the book should never be read again, it has no poit to it , the book was poorley writen and everyone should burn the book if thay have a copy" ".  So, back to the first randomness, being a "book and language snob" doesn't sound so bad after reading such insights.  But enough of that.  Now to something with a little of a point. I'm just about to go over some of the lectures for the last week of the summer session, and here we are dealing with the medievals. I must admit, I'm looking forward to it. While St. Augustine probably will always be the  primus inter pares  in my "great thinkers" list, many of the medieval thinkers rank right up there. On the downside, there is too much of a tendency to look at the time period from the fall of the Western Roman Empire until the Renaissance (or Reformation, or the so-called Enlightenment) as a vast wasteland of superstition, pedantry, near-totalitarian papal rule, and general chaos. By doing so, nearly one thousand years of learning are lost, often addressing questions and issues better than the moderns have or do. On the upside (for me), my dissertation chair is a medieval scholar, and opened the student's eyes to a grand world.  So (and whether this is an upside or downside for the audience, I leave to the side), collected here is a short list of some medieval works/thinkers/secondary works that may be of interest to those wanting to jump into an exciting and unique intellectual  milieu .  --As I study politics, I figure I should start with some of the better selection lists. For sheer breadth, a place to start would be   urlLink From Irenaeus to Grotius: A Sourcebook in Christian Political Thought 100-1625  , by the O'Donovans (Oliver and Joan Lockwood). Along with the self-protection benefits of this tome (it's thick enough to withstand .357 caliber bullets) (don't ask how I know), it is exhaustive in terms of collecting as many thinkers as possible. But, with increased quantity, there is a tendency for decreased quality - while you can get a glimpse of what these thinkers were trying to get across, it remains just that, a glimpse. There are two works that are more focused on the medievals that will be of more use, one being Brian Tierney's   urlLink The Crisis of Church and State 1050-1300   [good for selections of texts from various leaders, papal, imperial, and other], and the other being Nederman & Forhan's   urlLink Readings in Medieval Political Theory 1100-1400   [focused more on the great thinkers of the time].  --Now to primary texts (or as best as one can come to them if you don't read Church Latin and can't swing by England or Italy for six months). No doubt the most famous of the medievals in the West would be St. Thomas Aquinas. The trick, of course, is that Thomas wrote somewhere in the neighborhood of eight million words during his short lifetime - where to begin, and what should be read first, being difficult. Just on the philosophical side, probably one should start with his  urlLink volumes    urlLink Summa   urlLink Contra   urlLink Gentiles   (five books - couldn't find part II of Book Three at Amazon, but I know it must be there). Here, Thomas shows how, by using Aristotelian science, one could come to some truths about God, creation, and so forth. This would be a good introduction to his style of thinking. Then, of course, if you have the resources, one should definitely look at his   urlLink Summa Theologiae  .  But, there were other thinkers than just Thomas. So, for a different look at the medieval mind through the eyes of a contemporary, start with this  urlLink introduction  to a group of texts from St. Bonaventure, the general of the Franciscan Order. His "The Soul's Journey into God" is rather interesting. Unlike the Aristotle-inspired, Dominican Thomas, Bonaventure is more in line with the Augustinian (and neo-platonic) way of thinking. Makes for a nice comparison.  And there are other thinkers, as well. The list, naturally, is not exhaustive, but just points to some that might be interesting. So, for instance, there is John of Salisbury, a cleric in England, who wrote the   urlLink Policraticus  . Probably most famous for giving a (somewhat qualified) justification for tyrannicide, John also explicates a notion of the "body politic," using this metaphor (though possibly looking at it as more than a metaphor) to show the interconnections and linking together of a kingdom like that of a human body. Most interesting stuff - the version linked to is a good translation, but it should be noted that it is an extended selection, and not the whole of the text.  While most of us are familiar with Dante via   urlLink The Divine Comedy   (or at least   urlLink The Inferno  ) from earlier education, he also wrote some works of a more explicitly political bent. One that stands alone would be   urlLink Monarchy  , in which Dante makes the case for basically a world empire. Given the tensions between the Church and State throughout the Middle Ages, one came to expect the thinkers of the age to side with one or the other, the ecclesiastical or the political. Dante chose the political (for a variety of reasons). While Dante the poet is never far from sight, this work is much more a formally logical treatise than literature. For those interested in medieval politics, Dante, or both, certainly worth a read.  Another thinker taking the side of the political, and also a good read, would be Marsilius (Marsiglio) of Padua, and his work   urlLink Defensor Pacis  . Marsiglio tries something a little different in this text (different, at least, for the time) - he wants to explicate a theory of state and society which leaves to the side the question of revelation (dedicating the second half of the book, if memory serves, to explicating how things get screwed up when the spiritual institutions attempt to interfere with the business of the temporal). In terms of political theory, he is certainly a fellow to read, whether focused only on the Middle Ages or not.  Then there is the great mind of Nicholas of Cusa, and his   urlLink The Catholic Concordance  . This is a work to start with on Cusanus, but certainly not a place to stop. His own history is interesting - starting as a part of the concilliarist party (for which the  Concordance  was written), he then become a strong supporter of the papacy. While this work is more concerned with the idea of the Church, and also of representation (for which he gets a greater deal of attention now), he was responsible for writing on sundry other topics, including a rather good work on the possibility of toleration.  There are many many others, but that's a start.  --Then there are some secondary works which might be worth your while. Some works that either introduce or expand upon a particular thinker would include James McEvoy's introductory book on  urlLink Robert Grosseteste  (a bishop in England, among the earliest individuals at Oxford, and writer of various treatises, with excellent insight into light); Dennis Tamburello's (admittedly less rigorous) introduction to  urlLink St. Bernard of Clairvaux ; and finally a more in-depth inspection of Marsiglio of Padua in Nederman's   urlLink Community and Consent  .  A more general introduction to the Middle Ages, of an acceptable quality, would be Luscombe's   urlLink Medieval Thought   (part of a serious on Western philosophy). It's not terribly expensive, and does give the reader a good feel for some of the more major (and not so major) thinkers of the time.  There are other secondary sources that may also be of interest. In terms of religion, or more specifically heresy, Lambert's   urlLink Medieval Heresy   is a good place to start - it gives the reader a broad overview of the heresies that were about, their suspected origins, and the like. Most fascinating. A work on a more specific heresy that I read recently, and found rather well done, was that of David Burr on the  urlLink Spiritual Franciscans  (a movement that would involve, to various levels of directness, Marsiglio of Padua, William of Ockham, and various others).  On the more political side, immediately two works come to mind (thought many more are possible). One of interest would be Joseph Strayer's monograph   urlLink On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State  . While a short text (about 120 pages), Strayer does a wonderful job of showing the developments through the Middle Ages that would form the elements of later political forms. From another angle comes the (not nearly as short) work of Ernst Kantorowicz, the amazing   urlLink The King's Two Bodies  . This magisterial book looks at the connections of legal theory, political theory, and theology, in terms of symbols, logical patterns, and the like, to flesh out the medieval notion of the one (sooner-or-later to be dead) body of the king with the other (never-dying) body of the king. The author is, admittedly, very German - so, in other words, the prose is dry enough to make New Orleans into a dust bowl - making the book at times a hard read. But very much worth it.  I was about to list some more, but I just saw how much is already in this post. So, Medievalpalooza must end for today.  There will be a quiz next week, so start reading. Or, if nothing else, stay tuned.

      Sometimes I get into chats with others about bias (or lack thereof) in the media. Usually, this bias is denied by those I argue with. But, then you see mention of polls like  urlLink this , and wonder what the response would be. Yes, perhaps this vast majority of Kerry supporters in the press corps can keep their objectivity about them, but one wonders whether or not such unity on political preference acts to create an "echo-chamber" atmosphere within the media, one where conventional wisdom dominates rather than investigation and critique.  Just a thought.

I just saw that Mallarme has kept the discussion going with  urlLink some thoughts  on my mention of manners in the last post, and I do intend on talking about them after marching through the grading circle of Hell (i.e. probably Friday). But I do have to reprint a portion of his comment at this blog, because it's just too good: " You've got to stop linking to my posts and complimenting me. It's embarrassing ."  Fear not, my friend - I'm sure the curmudgeon will return sooner or later, and reveal a complete jerk. Huh....that's not exactly the best selling point.  {ahem}  Moving right along....he also has a  urlLink quick thought  on Paleface's  urlLink meditation  on the manner.  And finally, from the angle of community, give this  urlLink post  a look from  urlLink profgrrrrl . Much grooviness.  If don't talk to you before tomorrow, have a good couple days.

      I completely forgot to mention this yesterday ( sigh ....note to self: get planner and  use it ), but the blogging might also be light-to-nonexistent from about Aug. 17 to Aug. 30. I return the the fabled homeland of Indiana during that time, and I'm not completely certain what my level of internet access will be at that point. Soooo....if I seem to disappear for a little while, I am not dead, and I have not decided to play desert father someplace in Wyoming. But, hopefully I'll have some chances to write more, and deliver to you the fine commentary you've come to expect here.  Please stop rolling your eyes.    It hurts my feelings.   Fine, and a happy screw you too!!!     No, I don't mean that.     But I need affirmation.     Preferably in the form of a grant, or other monetary gift.    Or not.    Okay, I'll stop now.

      Thinking about the last few larger posts, I notice there is, at least implicitly, a certain assumption behind what I've been writing. Might as well get it out in the open.  I am an elitist.  The audience at home is no doubt thinking, "you think this surprises us?" But, figured I should express it a little more clearly.  What do I mean by being an elitist? Certainly, I am not suggesting removing the equality before the law (and would be a damnable fool if I tried to deny the equality before God), and do not mean to suggest it. But, certainly to be an elitist does mean that egalitarianism, under some definition, is out.  Well, best to define what "elite" I have in mind. I am thinking of what some call the "natural aristocracy" on the one hand, and the idea of orders or classes of leisure (rightly understood) on the other. To the first. A natural aristocracy, as I see it, includes those who are, for lack of a better term, born and made as the best in some higher field of human experience (intellect, theology, political activity, art, etc.). "Born" meaning that these individuals, for whatever reason, have a certain innate talent and drive for this type of higher activity. "Made" refers to these same individuals being instructed (or crafted, or some other term...I have yet to determine which is the best description) into the mindset, discipline, and character of such high activities. Admittedly, while the very best would be those with the highest levels of both, there is a spectrum on this scale (in other words, some are born with great potential, but by lack of instruction don't fulfill it completely; or some are not as innately gifted, but by instruction can make more with what they have). To the second. In attempting to mold a group of such individuals, it is best that there is a class or order in society that has leisure rightly understood (something that has mention in  urlLink Paleface's post  on conversation). This "rightly understood" means that this leisure would be spent, by custom and social pressure, in the higher pursuits, without the worry of day-to-day needs.  In the contemporary context, the first (natural aristocracy) is still in existence. The second, the order or class, has ceased to be, and is not likely to return in the Western world in the foreseeable future.  While I could go on more about these definitions, there is another point, more important to this post, to make. I am an elitist. But, by the definition given, I am not among the elite.  This can be a difficulty for many. Often, when one runs into an elitist (at least of the more humdrum kind), this individual assumes s/he  is  among the elite. Sadly, this seems rather typical of a large portion of those younger people who recently received undergraduate degrees in philosophy (among others). It is easy to be an elitist if you think you are of the highest rank. But, that can slip quite easily into a self-made delusion.  But, on the other hand, elitism remains even where it is supposedly shunned. Consider a vast number of dedicated egalitarians. While all for total equality and the like,  of course  these particular individual activists (whether by right of raised conscienceness, speaking truth to power, being the voice of the marginalized, what have you) will have to "take the lead" to bring along those still mired in false interests or the like. So, there is a reverse - the most unelitist activist, often by his/her very practice, illustrates elitism (with, again, this particular person being among the elite).  If one understands elitism in the style I mention, it would rather seem to call for some humility, and a good deal of self-consideration. To see that there is a natural proclivity for some to be the best does not equate to meaning that  you the observer  are among that group. If, upon reflection, you see where in the general hierarchy of talent and ability you are placed, it is best to live in one's place. I look at my own place, and the analogy that comes to mind is a medieval one. There is an elite, and elite of great intellects, stretching from the past to the present. Among them, I am rather like a cleric scribe in a Middle Ages monastery - I can copy the great thinking of a St. Thomas Aquinas or a St. Bonaventure, and perhaps even on some little point offer some guidance for clarifying their thinking or for those great minds that will come later. But as for myself, I realize I will  not  be one of those thinkers. Better to respect them, and try to learn from them.  But, we live in a time where respect of that sort is hard to bring about - it is not generally in our upbringing. A scholastic named Bernard de Chartres apparently once said, "In comparison with the ancients we stand like dwarves on the shoulders of giants" - we may see a little further, but only because of the height we stand on. Today, we are like ants crawling on the heads of titans - we too may see a little further, but our vision is fractured.  Enough rants ( why do I hear "less talk, more rock" in my mind? ).

       I remember a philosophy professor of mine telling the class a story about the brilliant/crazed thinker   urlLink  Ludwig Wittgenstein   . Now, when Wittgenstein taught a class, it was just over whatever he happened to be thinking about at the time. So, on some days, the students would sit in the classroom as Wittgenstein simply looked at them. In silence. For twenty or so minutes. Then, he would simply say, "I'm sorry, I have nothing to tell you today. Please go."  While I doubt that I have nothing to tell you today, I doubt it will be anything like the last couple days. But, who knows?  That having been said, there are a couple things that would be worth while to look at (then come back in a few hours, and there will, hopefully, be more here).  Continuing on the conversation on conversation (look   urlLink  here    and   urlLink  here   ), there is   urlLink  another wonderful addition   , coming from Paleface at   urlLink  Orthos Logos    - while my posts tend to be, well, extended reflections without a great deal of coherence or structure, Paleface makes a wonderful contribution to the ongoing discussion. While his discussion covers sundry bases, here's a sample selection:   What is my point? I am actually setting up a few things here, if I am competent to unpack them coherently. For one thing, I am going to agree with Mallarme that "serious, deep conversations are inherently private affairs between a handful of people". They will never be appreciated by hoi polloi, to put it bluntly. But since they require so much they are on thin ice to begin with -- the conditions in which a band of capable men more serious about thinking than about anything else can come together are rare enough; add to this the indifference or hostility of the public and the situation is precarious indeed. It has always been so and, I suspect, always will be so.   Paleface fears that he runs " the risk of rambling more than conversing ," but not at all. The distinction between concise argument and conversation might be like the difference between sex and love-making: sure, you can go the quick way on these things, but it's not nearly as fun.  I can't believe I just made that comparison.  Over at   urlLink  Do Thy Research   , the Teaching Assistant gives us some   urlLink  old school classics    (literally) of older essays. I myself have never read any of the Harry Potter books, but seeing the essay (and reading other mentions by the TA and other friends) does tempt me to pick it up. When free time arrives. Soooo....looking ahead to retirement....  Meanwhile,   urlLink  Da Goddess    has a trippy post dealing with   urlLink  her interactions    with the unique group CodePINK. It reminds me of one of the reasons I tended towards academia over activism - there are some real weirdos out there (but, then again, looking at some of the professional conferences....but I digress).  One more that caught my eye are actually two from Terry Teachout at   urlLink  About Last Night   , especially as they involve the blogosphere. In the   urlLink  first   , Mr. Teachout analyzes the lack of perspective some critics are taking regarding Leon Wieseltier's review in the  New York Times Book Review  of Nicholson Baker's  Checkpoint . It definitely helps clear the air a bit by explaining what the book review business expects. In the   urlLink  second   , more directly related to blogging - he wisely says that, especially among those of us who have comments sections (at least), time to freshen up on libel laws. Sadly, that angle had not even come into my mind, so I must admit, in the near future, I'll be doing a little reviewing on that - I think that everyone has been generally good about that, but if not, my apologies, but your post gonna go.  As I think of it, some moons ago I mentioned some guidelines for comments at this blog. As a refresher,   urlLink  here they are   .  More later. Stay tuned.  (Oh, as for quoting Wittgenstein, I must admit, I haven't read much of him. The philosophy I read tends to either be from those who are long dead, or others that seem to suit my fancy, like that of   urlLink  Sir Karl Popper   . That reminds me - generally, books about philosophers can be a little dull. With few exceptions, St. Augustine as an instance, most philosophers have comparatively dull lives, or little is known of them - as such, most books about them tend only to interest we masochists  I MEAN  scholars. But, give   urlLink   Wittgenstein's Poker     a read - it tells the story of the lives of Popper and Wittgenstein, in the hopes of reconstructing an odd incident involving a poker being swung about by one towards the other. A worthwhile read.)

      Just for regular readers (or those who will hopefully be so), August 11 and 12 will probably have few to no posts. I will have exams to give and then to grade in record time. Soooo, Thursday afternoon will probably see me asleep or drunk. Not necessarily in that order. As such, I may just put up some links to some "greatest hits" or the like.  Or just post something to the persuasion of "kill me....kill me...."  But more after that, true believers. Excelsior!

      {  WARNING : This is going to be a longer one, with quite a few extended quotes. It will be worth your while, or your money back. Read on... }  At the end of my previous post on the topic, a decidedly negative turn occurred. Not that the rest was exactly wine and roses, going-to-my-happy-place commentary, but still, not quite  that  pessimistic. And to this, there were some quite enlightening responses.  Mallarme (for  urlLink the Greater Nomadic Council ) took some exception to one point, and quite rightly, when he  urlLink wrote :   In answer to his question, there are many forums for enlightening discussions. One of the more obvious ones is blogs. Yes, there are many superficial, troll-ridden discussions, but our own humble experiment has been fairly successful at generating some long, fascinating discussions on a wide range of topics. Then, of course, there's always the hours-long coffee shop conversations with intelligent friends and strangers which can be both insightful, entertaining, and highly rewarding.    I imagine what Phil is really talking about are more public, influential discussions though. In that case, he's correct to claim they just aren't any high profile, serious-minded debates about "the good, the true, the beautiful," but I'm not sure if there ever has been. Our current mass media and its nearly ubiquitous reach is unprecedented. It's not an 18th century French salon, an English coffee house, or a Greek symposium. As a result of its very nature as a visual medium, television devalues the written word and the more patient meditations it allows, an attitude that I think informed those types of discussions in the past. Furthermore, television directs its "debates" at a vastly larger audience than Plato would have ever considered. Socrates's dialogues were between himself and a handful of other people, much like current round tables, but they didn't take place on the floor of a packed Coliseum (yes, I know that's an anachronism). This suggests that serious, deep conversations are inherently private affairs between a handful of people, precisely the form of conversations that can still be found.   These are all very good points. Alas, I think I did mash categories to an extent - a private conversation cannot, by its nature, translate to a large audience, especially a passive audience. "Passive" is the key word here. In this day and age, we can look back at the dialogues of Plato, and act as spectators of a conversation, but the experience of the thing, while perhaps imitated, is not actualized. In this true type of dialogue, we can refute, confirm, challenge, re-interpret, and so forth with our fellow conversationalists. While the writings of Plato, and others, are excellent, we can't talk to the dead in a real sense. Only in the way Machiavelli mentions, where the thinker today will "enter the ancient courts of the men of antiquity..." and hope that the "conversation" can suffice.  On the larger scale, especially regarding the political, perhaps what is missing is a higher form of rhetoric, to put it bluntly. Yes, there is rhetoric already, but too often it is either lifeless or with all the worth of a demagogue's rants. With the political culture today, Cicero would be a blowhard and Burke accused of snobbery. Perhaps both claims are accurate, and yet, this type of speaking not only dealt with the particular issue at hand, but also what it meant to be a Roman, a subject of the British Crown, what have you. Not sugary truisms, where a policy is supported as extending freedom (with no thought on what "freedom" means), but something more considered. With considered thought comes longer speeches, and of a different type than today. It requires an eloquence, as its audience  is  passive, hopefully activating later, when the speech is done, and with some others, conversation on the speech, and its points, can be worked-over.  But then, there is the blog. And yes, one need only spend five minutes to find diatribes, nonsense, and lunacy that seems to require some tinfoil for the head and thorazine for the mind, but there are others. And perhaps, be it so disjointed, stilted, and suffering the problems that occur by trying to make a dialogue something written, the blogosphere presents another avenue for conversation. While lacking the intimacy and immediate experience that is among the delights of discussion, it does serve to expand the bounds - so, conversationalists from Texas, California, New York, and sundry other spots can "speak" in a way that, short of us all renting a hotel room at some point, would be impossible otherwise. Perhaps there is some hope after all.  From a bit of a different angle, Chris (at  urlLink Californian Sojourn )  urlLink notes  that even on television, there might be an angle of use:   I do admit though that there are times when education can be had but I have only found it in one format, the hour long interview. And even then that is relative to the interviewee and the interviewer. Otherwise for my true educational needs I'll just stick with the books and whatever VDH happens to write.   This one-on-one format does seem to have some potential. Admittedly, it has been a while since I've seen one (only recently have I  urlLink re-acquired  a television set, and even then, only for watching tapes or DVDs), but perhaps it depends on the structure. If the interviewer is not strictly trying to keep the interviewee to a certain group of topics, but rather lets the conversation flow through its own logic, then indeed perhaps something good can come from it. But, if the interviewer has certain "talking points" that s/he wants addressed, this could stifle the conversation ("Okay, Socrates, we've spent some time on the beautiful, but moving along to the good....").  But this leads me, finally, to the indomitable  urlLink Terry Teachout , who  urlLink responded  with another medium:   One word: radio. It's not perfect, but in the past couple of years I've taken part in a number of radio interviews and conversations that were both pleasurable and stimulating. Especially in this new age of streaming audio, I have a good feeling about the future of radio as a creative medium.   I have to admit, I sadly hadn't even thought of radio, but this is an excellent point. And there are elements of radio ( contra  television) that would tend to enhance conversation - stage setting and other such things would not be as great a concern. The words themselves could be allowed free play. But, again, the limiting factor might be how the interviewing, etc., is done. As long as the interviewer is not set on limiting the conversation, then there is potential.  But, this does lead to something else. Reading through the  urlLink Barzun book  (which I would strongly recommend - Barzun is an excellent author, and quite in a league of his own), there is this one question - do any of us know  how  to be conversationalists anymore? Or are the very manners of conversation today stymied?  To rephrase: consider a conversation you have had, any conversation where ideas may enter in (literary, political, theological, aesthetic, whatever). Do you and the others flesh out points, willing to show ( sans  acrimony) contradictions or leaps in logic, and able to see the bigger picture through examples (while not getting locked into concerns about minute and irrelevant specifics on the examples)? Or are we restrained, to a certain extent, by our own manners and, for lack of a better term, social "rules-of-play"? Do we instead look for a consensus, trying to avoid ripping the other apart, or (on the other hand) defend one's own position not in terms of finding Truth but rather holding the line, all the while finding nits to pick with the opponent?  Sadly, this is a portion I have not thought through terribly well (as the previous paragraph no doubt illustrates), but it is another element perhaps worth considering. Do our rules of conduct in conversation today allow for real conversation? Or do we rather chit-chat nicely, reaching no end (or at best, to agree to disagree without strenuous effort)? I don't know. I will have to think on it more. But I do thank Mallarme, Chris, and Mr. Teachout for their enlightening voices. Hopefully, if we can continue in discussion, perhaps we will reach conversation, and in the very process of doing so, find the truth in the matter.

      Seeing the interest in the topic of  urlLink conversation , I'm planning on having a new post regarding the matter in the near future (but, since I hope to make it worthwhile, best to check back in a couple of hours from now).  In it, I hope to get into a discussion...well, a written discussion...with some of the other ideas thus far presented - from  urlLink Mallarme ,  urlLink Chris , and  urlLink Terry Teachout .  For those of you coming from  urlLink About Last Night , welcome.  Please feel free to search about the blog, and come back again.   And for those regular readers familiar with my love of that page, Terry  freakin'  Teachout linked here!!!  This is (for me) the weblog equivalent of reaching Valhalla.  Life is good.  Stay tuned, true believers - more to come soon....
