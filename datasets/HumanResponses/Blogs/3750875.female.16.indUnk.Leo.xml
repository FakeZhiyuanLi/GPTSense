      Ok well I'm back again today.  geez my life really blows rite now.  He's on vacation, and I can't reach him.  Also, tomorrow I have to go to a stupid family reunion, it is gunna be so boring.  Nothing to do at all.  If only dreams did come true, then well, everyone would be happy, but the world would be really messed up.  But in this case, I dunno, maybe I'm just lonely, because of the whole "I've never had a boyfriend" thing.  Oh well, and the other guy, well I used to like him, but he thought I was annoying, and he has a gf now.  Oh well, I have to deal with that.  It was funny tho, the other day, I was talking to him and we were acting like nothing happened, (the whole, "ya I don't like you" thing)  I felt like we had been through so much together, when in reality we hadn't.  The more I think about one small thing, the bigger it seems.  It really isn't good, I make a big deal out of all of the small things.  geez, and if these two guys were to read this they would know I'm talking about them, especially the one with the gf.  I dunno, maybe I'm just sad that another year of school has ended and I'm not gunna see everybody as much for 2 whole months.  Wow.  The whole thing about another year gone by really scares me.  yikes only two more years until university.  Ok kallie stop scaring yourself.  Ok it's getting late and I'm getting tired.  goodnite :P

      hello.   why can't dreams come true, well if they did, the world would be really screwed up.  everyone would have what they wanted. NE WAYS. why didn't I wait for him after the science exam.  I could have talked to him.  If only he knew that I liked him back.  I was so happy when melissa told me that he  used to   like me.  oh well.  What's so wrong with the whole music thing?  It's not my whole life, just a part of it.  maybe he still likes me.  what if he does tho.... if i had waited for him afetr the science exam something  might  have happened.  but it's too late now.  summer vacation has started.  there are really no more chances to talk to him.  i don't have his phone number, and sending an e-mail is so impersonal.  and he really hasn't been on msn at al lately, so i can't talk to him then.  oh well there is nothing i can do now, and it is all my fault, i should have thaken the chance when i had it.  ok.  i'm done.

      OMG I HAVE GREAT NEWS, well sort of i guess.  greg emailed me, asking if i was doing any volunteer work over the summer, and if so, could he come along, well i emailed him back saying that i wasn't planning to do any volunteer work, but if he wanted to hang out he could call me.  it was nice to know that he was thinking of me, i guess, maybe he still does like me, why else would he have sent me that email???  oh well, i'll just have to wait and see if he calls me.  i took the email, as a way of him asking me out, sort of, but i wan't sure, maybe he is just using me to get his volunteer hours...(i greatly doubt it tho)oh well, the ball is in his court, if he wants to call me he can, and if he doesn't thats his problem.  oh well, the email made me feel more in touch wiht reality, someone was reaching out to me.  meh, i could always call one of my friends tho... but i just don't like the phone, msn is so much easier, i can think before saying (or in this typing)something. oh well.  that si all i have to say for now, i'll keep you posyed on all of the goings on wih greg.  au revoir.

      hello.  i'm back.  today was so boring.  i really had nothing to do but sit in the tent in the backyard.  it was really nice though, ya know, just to have some alone time.  I can't wait until i go out east, it's gunna be so much fun, going camping for the first time.  anyways. oh geez, i had to go to a stupid family reunion yesterday, but it wasn't as boring as i thought it would be.  the people who were hosting it had a pool and a trampoline.  it was pretty cool, but i was so tired at the end of the day, who knew that you could get a really good workout on a trampoline!?!?! oh well.  i have a sunburn too, on my face and back it hurts sooooo much, an my back anyways, it isn't so bad on my face, i really hope my face doesn't peel, oh that'd be really gross.  ne ways. oh well, it's nice to have a little colour :P  i really wish that i had more to do during that day.  i kinda miss school, cuz u get to see all of your friends, and some classes are fun, just when you are with friends, or hot guys... hahahaha that's great.   i really want my yearbook at the end of the year, and not the beginning of the next year, i mean, you forget everything form the past year, and if you can't think of anything to say, you can't exactly say "have a good summer"  and when you don't see someone for a whole two months over the summer break, you would be able to see their picture in the yearbook.  it just has more meaning to get it at the end of year.  oh good, any 15 more minutes until my show starts,  hahaha.  i just had to find something to do while waiting for it.  oh well, i think i've said enough for today. goodbye.

      well, life is really great rite now.  i can't stop thinking about greg.  i really should call him.  oh well.  i wonder why he didn't call me tho, and just sent me that email?  oh well, the email was good so i can't complain.  i really have to call sam, and tell her all about this!  ok.  well, maggie figured out that i have msn, so if i don' giver $3.50 then i'm dead.    ok, a while ago, i dunno, a week ago i think the dog chewed up my retainer, i was soooooo dead, (grounded for one week! and no computer!!!!!) but ya, i wasn't supposed to be on the computer when it happened, i was in really big trouble.  ne ways.  i wonder, are greg and i a couple?  i mean, i kinda asked him out and he said yes, i think, cuz he said that he did want to hang out, so are we a couple? i really don't know.  i should call him, and see if he wants to go see spiderman or something.  that would be really cool.  the only problem is that i have no money.  oh well, i still haven't been paid for thaking care of that dog.  meh.  i'll prob. only get 10 bucks.  meh.  i g2g bye!
