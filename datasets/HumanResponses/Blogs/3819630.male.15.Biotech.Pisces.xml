      today is pretty boring... and i lvoe it... well to an extent.  Yesterday travuis jsut came over and hung out here. after supper he came over and then we went to macs and over to jades.. that was a fun time. i played jade in pool. i lost. but seh still worships me over my trickshot into the corner. tahts right, seh gaeve me 6 bows. yeah but my parents were being butts so i had to leave at 11:30. sucks. but then i got home and watched sofija(rhino transformer) and vanessa(gingerbread tombstone) on their webcam...yehah im bad at wrestler names. anyways they had a huuge wrestling match. vanessa was dominating at first. but then rhino came back and tied it up and maybe one., im not sure. im not saying anything. after a brutal loss of energy getting up i went to bed.  today i have done nothing, but wash my car. thats all. yip and now im trying to convince geoff that if he doesnt see a movie tonight with me, the ladies in black will come and get him. i think hes scared. yes geoff. you should be.  well i gotta go eat. cya

      word  well today was pretty cool indeed. me and evan and mark watched TV into the early hours of the morning. marks a butt, he wouldnt let   tobie be on teh couch with him.. he jsut complained about how she kicks him and stuff. pucha. i wonder if   tobey would do the same. yeah so then the little doggy went upstairs and mark was happy. we woke up at like 12:30 and went up for some 4 day old rock hard dry as a mandelin pizza. yumm-y fo sho. sounds like   martha   stewert cooking.   Leo. After that we watched some old b movie about a magic coin on the family channel. it was heartwarming. too bad   Ray   Barone wasnt in it :( so after that mark and evan came in my pool. it was a good time. we tried to attemp a human tower but failed deperately. yeah. the time in teh water definately got me thinking. what a genious is   the   guy   who   invented   the    canoe. it was time for them to leave. we had our farewells and they took their journey accros the street. i almost made them call me when they got home. that was corny like a cornfield. and me and mark wenyt to vanessas house and made our escape plan if her parents came home. they never did but it was good in case. we ahd a few scary moments. yah so me and mark walked home and here i am. on teh computer once again.  sorry to all the confused people.   sofija is the only one who will understand this masterpiece

      sup d00ds, this is my first post because i want to be liek teh other million people in guelph who have these. well tonight i went to the annual canada day celebration. and waht a fun night taht was (sarcasm). First myself adn friends were supposed to meet up at canadian tire, but only a few showed and turned out many were already in teh park. oh well that was no problem and we walked there.  when we got there we walked around, met up with other people, looked at teh various blow up things and went to the petting zoo.  The petting zoo was the best fucking thing in the world, besides teh animal cruelty part of liek diarea water and small cages, teh baby lama (jefferson) was my favourite. he ahd fingers for lips i swear. it was sweet. i made it lick me. many times. after teh lama we decided to go in and meet the goats and other animals . baby goats and big goats and 4 horned deformed goats... there was them all. i like the small ones .. sofija hogged them though :( yup and there was this white bird dislocating his neck and somehow in a freakish way try to roll it onto his back ,. then an old lady came up and explain it that they do taht for attention from teh females. evan is going to try it at teh mall. indeed. this trip to teh zoo took about 1.5 hours i think.   we then went to teh river and annoyed little youngens by throwing golf balls down this slide thing and making them get it. yup, fun stuff. we then found a tree and climbed it like no tomorow. wow. then we went and set down on our trusty blankets. mine was te coolest. big fluffy pink one. i love it. i was talking to people for a long time and then got hungry. got some pizza, kate forced me to buy her some with her own money, and ate it. i then did a whole lot of nothing.  I then went over to the ride area with people such as evan, sofija, jade, brodie, mitch, randy i think thats it. waited for 30 minutes in teh ferris wheel line adn went absolutely nowhere. i gave up ... i told them i was going back to teh blankets. adn left. as soon as i left the fireworks bursted into action. it was so dark and i was running to fin the blankets... but couldnt... it wa scary .. i ran back and forth, circles, upsidedown, doing backflips for 15 mintutes calling peoples names stepping on people when randy said MIKE.... evan and randy were lost too and i sat with them to watch the fireworks. we then sang teh national anthem in opera style. fun stuff.. when tehy ended me and randy and evan went searchign fro teh group .... and fuinaly aftert several trips saw the shadow of ray, and his shaggy hair standing on a picnic table. the relief. and we ran over and gratefully met.  we then went back to canadian tire. randy told teh officer he was like moses parting teh red seas when he was stopping traffic. he laughed and said he was teh strongest man in teh world. i laughed. like this "he he he he and so on". we tehn saw teh new york style parnking lot and decided it was not the best place for a pick up. we continues up a hill of tall grass and had a washroom break.yup.yup.yooeeyyyy. sorry . yeah so we walked down this street. and asked this lady with an ice cream cone where teh hardware store was... and seh said down there and pointed. cool huh. thought so. and told marks brother to pick us up there. of course evan had to get some food so he stopped in tim hortons. we sat on a wood thing. then an old friend walked by , and i wasnt shure if it was her or not. but on msn later i confirmed it was. that was cool seeing her again. its been a looooooong time fo sho. evan ran right past us down the street. we waited for sooo long and tehn went in .. he wasnt htehre so we ran down that street and found him at teh end. i dont knwo how many times someone got lost tonight.   it is 12:47 now and im tired. i ahve chiropractor in teh morning. and this thing i jsut wrote is very long and im tired so excuse teh spelling ... i try to type fast. FAST LIKE A......PAAAANDA . yes. and anyways .. thanks to randy for coming down to g town. it was a blast. cya next time. word...............il see yall next time .... peace
