      I had a dream last night and it was a scene with my sister. We were arguing about a silly thing. Tak tahu apa-lah, Dah lup. But what was apparent was the feeling of jealousy and competition was there. I've always had that feelingand it has dissipitated as I gre up and its not so strong now as an adult.  I wonder will I ever stop feeling as if I have to proof something to everyone that I am better, or prettier or more popular.  No question, our relationship has improved this past year staying together and we have gained a sense of respect and space of each other which I didn't think possible when we first moved in.   Perhaps once I have become more confident and comfortable with who I am, how I look, who I have become and becoming I will think less on what I should be.  I love my sisters and if any changes are too be made I believe it must firstly come from me, to change my perception of the situation and future relationships.

      In every heart there lives a longing,  to be heard, to be known But when this little speck begins to grow and grow, and grow Larger then its meant to be.. well..so begins our tale.  Small in height, unfortunate on sight Silly Sally as she's known to all Often walked with her head held down, staring at her toes sticking out from her ratty shoes, was one of her many woes  She hated to walk through the main road in town 'People would stare', she says 'People would judge, and look down on me and me alone.' And so when food ran short, oh how she moaned Contemplating of the harrowing journey  If only Sally had seen, the pity in their eyes How Geoffrey the butcher had meat to spare at the end of the day And Mary the fruit seller put aside the over ripe apples In the hope it could be given to poor Silly Sally  But how she frowned and scowled and shook her head Imagining all sorts of insults and stones that would be thrown her way How could little her keep so much dislike at bay Soon the towns people avoided her. ' She's going mad,' they said 'She should never come out, she should stay in bed,'  ( To be continued...)

       Memories   My strongest memory of Mama is her hugs. She gave the best hugs, so warm and safe and felt so loved. She smelt mostly of Aloe Vera, the Jergens brand which she often rubbed on her hands. Her skin was soft and smooth and she had the blackest hair, thick in tight  short ringlets. She permed it every few months. It suited her. Old pictures showed her to have long, straight, thick hair in her youth which she wove in the 'beehive' back in the sixties complete with sunnies.   Growing Up  Mama was the fifth child and second oldest daughter in a family of eight children, one of which had passed away  as a child. She was known as a strong character, always ready to speak her mind but mindful of her manners especially in the company of her Grandmother. Her own mother, my Grandmother, was the beloved youngest daughter of a wealthy merchant in Batu Gajah.   I don't know much about her primary school years, but she did enjoy her secondary schooling immensely. She was a diligent, hardworking student and one of the few girls that attended Sultan Yusof School in the mid 1950's. This was just before Merdeka, and British presence was strongly felt throughtout Malaysia. Schools were still conducted in English with an English syllabus.  She who apparently learnt English by reading the Dictionary, and was a voracious reader. She met Papa at school but they were only friends. It was only later that they fell in love.  Ironic how three of the four girls in Year 5, married a boy from their class. How sweet. Mama was active in the Girl Guides. I've seen pictures of her grinning back, wearing the blue beret and proudly showing her badgeson her sleeves. Her proudest moment as a guide was being chosen to hold the new Malaysian flag at Stadium Merdeka on Independence day as Tunku Abdul Rahman, our first Prime Minister said, ' Merdeka, Merdeka' followed by the rousing crown gathered.   Mama was initially named Choon Yoong, however she was a sick baby as medicine was scarce. Her named meant sky  and her Grandmother prayed and changed her name to Khoon, meaning earth. In essence calling the soul back to Earth not to leave and fly to Heaven. So closer family members called Mama Khoon Yong.  Mama went to Australia at 19, sent by her father to study nursing. She had a married older brother in Melbourne. After about a year, Ma decided to move to UK and continue her Nursing there. Before she left a few years later, she married Papa who was continuing his studies. She was a certified Midwife in a couple of years. The first of her six girls were born in London.    On a Journey    I loved my Mama a lot, but at times I didn't understand why she was so angry. I see now as an adult why she seemed at times very stressed and out of sorts. It must have been hard raising six girls and run the family business. I would have like to have known her as an adult. I suppose I have had a unique experience being the last of her children by her bed before she passed on. It was a surreal experience. That whole year was a dream, unreal.   Form 4 was a mixed year: I was doing the best at scholl then I have in years and was able to make lots of friends, was very active at co-curiculum. At the same time, Ma was diagnosed with cancer. And she was going through chemo, in and out of hospital. We had to go through her body slowly wasting away and her mood swings, one day so happy next crying and depressed. I haven't really thought about how I felt in that year. I cut off emotionally  quite a lot. Realised how self-absorbed I was. What do you expect form a 16 year old. Its been almost 11 years now although it seems like just yesterday.

       Family   Technically I'm a middle child; fourth of six girls. It was loud, a little crazy at times growing up. I loved it although at the time I might disagree! We hardly had any friends come over, my sister were my companions growing up. After school it was straight home. Mama was strict, and usually if Mama says it.. well.   During school holidays we would have mini fashion shows, and built castles out of mattresses and cushions. The twins are seven years younger and ho ho, did I have fun.  When they were 5 or 6, we told them to stand under the rambutan tree and put their arm up to catch the  falling fruits. They stayed like that till lunch, we had unfortunately forgotten about them. Poor things!  My sisters and I , are very close. I tell them almost everything and its good to share so much of my life with them. Living with my sis ( a year older)  was trying the first year - we of ten quarelled as if we were still 8 and 9. Much better now, more matured.. I hope.  Mama passing away 11 years ago was the most significant time of my life. It took a long time to be able to talk about her passing without crying. I still do at times, when I think of a childhood memory or times when I wish we could get to know each other as adults.    Interests  I love to read. I used to be very picky what I read but I decided to just try as many different authors as possible and as many different genre's I just like escaping into a their world.   After Raleigh expedition I realise I like the outdoors immensely and travelling! There's so much to see and do. ( see Raleigh International)   My apartment has at last lost the "student" look and is like a proper apartment. It didn't take much to spruce it up a bit. Am excited moving to the new apartment my sis has bought, something more permanent in my life. Its such a joy inviting friends to come over and have dinner and drinks. The whole preparation of the food and nice cutlery and dishware. How cultured...   Education  I spent most of my primary and secondary years at SM Convent Ipoh (Main Convent)Not quite the nerd, but not quite one of the popular kids. It was pretty intimidating growing up with all my older siblings in the 'Popular' category. I had fun at school, especially fourth form. Being sixteen was the most exciting year. SO many things happened.  Was at H.E.L.P Inst for a year.( Higher Education Learning Programmes)Remains one the silliest acronyms ever for a college. It was good fun. My first part time job and paying my rent. That was agood feeling > first taste of real freedom. Best decision I made was transferring to Griffith Uni, Brisbane for my 2nd and Final year.   Loved Brissie and Australia. If ever there was a turning point in my life it was the next two years. Meeting so many people and living on my own(apart from sponging of my Papa..yikes) , working and travelling, boyfriends, best friends, enemies. I wish I could have used the time (and money) more wisely. I guess I wouldn't be where I am if  I didn't go through what I did those crazy years.      Work   Working as Customer Service in a callcentre has been interesting. #1 rule is patience. Not to let the customer's get toyou. To leave the work as soon as you leave the office. That took some time but its been ok. Its work, the office environment is good, have some good friends at work and I love just having a drik/dinner after work once in awhile.  I've been here 2 years 3 months. I dunno if I will stay longer , but eventually by this year I hope I will be in a different position. Its on my To DO list..

       Raleigh International Malaysia A Journey through Borneo February - April 2004    Summary   	Between February and April 2004, I participated on a ten week expedition organised by Raleigh International. Approximately 150 venturers; international and Malaysian youths aged 17 to 25; took part on several sustainable projects located in various parts of Sabah.   Raleigh International is a UK-based youth development charity formed in 1984 to inspire young people across the world to reach their full potential through participating in challenging projects worldwide. Each expedition is divided into three phases mainly Adventure, Environmental and Community.  The Adventure phase included hiking through the Crocker Range, scuba diving at Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park and assisted on the international Reef Check programme as well as climbing Mount Kinabalu.  Danum Valley was the focus of my Environmental project in the second phase, building a gravity water feed system as well as learning and experiencing the flora & fauna of one of Malaysia's oldest primary rainforest.  Finally, in the third and last phase, I assisted in the construction of a gravity water feed system at Kg Gana, a new community built for ten villages located in the Linkabau Forestry reserve.     Phase One: Adventure     Crocker Range   	After a four hour journey on the mini bus, we arrived at our first stop. Our first challenge was deciding on the most efficient method to transport twelve days worth of food for fifteen people plus equipment. Finally, it was agreed that we would all make two trips; crossing three rivers and a three-hour uphill hike. Two rangers, Adorty and En. Madi were our guides. I never knew I was capable of carrying 17-20 kilos and realized the challenge was more mental than physical, believing it was possible and just going ahead. Self-motivation was essential .   On the early hours of the fifth day, one team member, Marie,  experienced a series of fits. Our trained medic; Nigel; immedietly  took control and contacted the Chief Fieldbase medic, Yenz. It was concluded she had to be taken to the nearest hospital. Due to  the isolation of our position, she was carried on a stretcher to the nearest helicopter winch site about two hours away. It was a sobering time but brought our team, Alpha 8, closer together.  The last leg of the hike was also one of the toughest from Kg Terian to Kg Inabong through a series of hills. It would take the team almost nine hours to reach our final destination and with it, pride of acheivement and excellent team work and motivation. We were rewarded by the awesome views of  Mt Kinabalu , the bright lights of Kota Kinabalu and the islands in the far distance.   Memories  I was sleeping beside Marie on that fateful day. She had been feeling really unhappy since the beginning of the expedition, perhaps a mixture of homesickness, stress and bad reaction to the Malaria pills we were required to take. She was in a catotonic state, but her eyes were still open. Then she started having the seizures. Thank od Jacks and Nigel were so calm although I could see how stressed he was.  The first big hill we conquered was tough. I couldn't believe  I was carrying so much weight, al I could think about was just breathe and count the paces. The trekking phase, I couldn't appreciate the jungle as much as Environmental phase because often it was lets get from A to B quickly. (re: Terian to Inabong)    Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park   After almost two weeks deep in the jungle, anything from the asphalt road to TV and sit-down toilets were looked at in awe. Our minibus dropped Alpha 8 at Kota Kinabalu to begin the one day intensive course for PADI Open water and Advanced Open Water respectively. Next, on to Sutera Harbour to  Pulau Mamutik, a small island twenty minutes away by speedboat from Kota Kinabalu and our home for the next week.  It has one of the most spectacular coral, ideal for snorkelling and an introduction to the beauty of the reef. Borneo Divers conducted the classes and during the dives we  glimpsed  sea turtles, manta rays and fish species such as rainbow, butterfly, sweetlips, lion fish and barracuda among others.    On completion of our respective courses, we assisted scientists from the Sabah Parks Marine research Unit to collect data on coral quality, fish and inverterbrate numbers, and effects on pollution and illegal fishing for the international Reef Check programme.    Memories   It was pure luck that Ivan could lend me his perscription mask for diving. And that Borneo Divers found  my registration for my lost PADI Open Water Cert  more then 2 years ago. Taking Advanced Open Water was easy and so FUN! I thought what I saw at Pulau Mamutik was gorgeous. Snorkelling just from the shore and the reef spread out over such a large area. I got so tanned. Realised why  I liked diving so much. Seriously a whole new world.    Mount Kinabalu   From the sweltering heat of Pulau Mamutik we arrived to the cool winds of Mt Kinabalu.  Setting off at noon, we reached Laban Rata rest house in about five hours. The views on the way up were spectacular as the terrain changed the higher we climbed. The clouds were far below, unlike looking out  from an airplane and the clear blue sky high above us. The atmosphere at Laban Rata resembled a ski resort - with people in their  beanies, scarf's and thick sweaters. One could feel the anticipation for tomorrow's climb to the  summit. We awoke at 0230 hours to begin the three hour ascent  to witness the sunrise. As we climbed up, one could see a winding snake of lights from over a hundred people glowing brightly behind me. Not a cloud above me, only millions of stars. No words could aptly describe the beauty of the sunrise at the peak, as we sat in silence huddling close for warmth. It was the perfect end to the Adventure phase and heightened the sense of acheivement to all present.  Mt K was so beautiful. The terrain was so different  the higher we went up and I was most thankful for Jacks to stay with me. I've never been so tired. We survived on 6 crackers and a little peanut butter for a 5 hour hike up. Ha! Ha! Just being at the top at sunrise was an amazing experience, it was freezing cold though. But the clouds were way below us and the sunrise, on the horizon. I was in awe.     strong>Phase 2: Environmental   About Danum Valley   Anyone with an interest in tropical rainforest and its rich and diverse flora and fauna will be amply rewarded by a visit to Danum Valley. The entire valley is cut off from civilization by the vast surrounding primary forests. Danum Valley Conservation Area is one off Sabah's largest areas of undisturbed lowland rainforest. and covers 436sq km and said to have the world's  most complex ecosystem. It is also a sanctuary for endangered species including the Sumatran rhino, Orang-utan and the Asian pygmy elephant.  It is reported that Danum Valley has 37 species of fishes, 56 species of amphibians, 72 types of reptiles, 275 varieties of birds and thousands of insects, worms and other mollusks and invertebrates. . Some of the most beautiful and largest butterflies and moths can also be found here. During one of the jungle treks, I heard the loud whooping  territorial calls from the Borneo Gibbons , reverberating at the crack of dawn through the distant hills. One of the biggest attractions is to catch the elusive and shy Orang Utans  during the early morning walks.  I chanced up a couple of hornbills among a few tall trees at the hostel. Their presence is made unmistakable by the sound of their  cackles and noisy wing flapping. Every morning promptly at 0620 hours, we were awaken to the sounds of the secada's piercing screech; better then any alarm clock.     The Project: Danum Valley - Gravity Feed Water System   The aim of the project was to construct a Gravity Feed Water System to supply freshwater to the Danum Valley Field Centre. Our target for the second phase of the project was to ensure all the metal and polypipes were safely transported to the designated drop zone and to lay 230 eight and six inch polypipes, each six meters in length along the four km path.   The Project Managers facilitated the planning stage of the project, empowering the team (Alpha 6) to decide how we planned to reach the project objectives. It gave us the opportunity to use our organisation and decision-making skills as well as learning to compromise and discuss our ideas. The team worked very well and we did reach our targets for the phase. I realised only with full co-operation from all members and giving each other constant motivation  did we acheive our goals. We had excellent rapport with the Guides from Danum who we assisted in the project, contributing to a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere. The Guides from different ethnicity, offered a wealth of information about the flora and fauna as well as their individual cultural backgrounds. The heavy rains made the trails very muddy and slippery, which only added to the 'Indiana Jones' experience.   Additional activities-Assisting scientists Organisations such as the Royal Society UK  fund undergraduate and postgraduate research to Danum Valley Field Centre. We were fortunate to assist in the research of one scientist; Rob; on the study of the dispersement of seeds in a controlled and natural environment. He talked about the Danum flora and fauna, which gave many of us a greater appreciation of our environment.    Memories  In the beginning I  thought Danum would be a boring phase but it was good in so many ways. The short film! Am so glad we eventually did it. 'Murder rep: Death on St. paddy's Day'. The plt is one by one 'The Hand' is killing us off.   Claire: Killed by a scorpian in a bucket: Bucket went over her head Ruth: Death by poisoned Milo Jen: distracted by Hassan a.k.a Johnny Depp,  Nick: had a 6m poly pipe dropped on his head , and he got 'stuck' in one D a.k.a Daveena : Was having fun on the 'beach' and buried in the sand with only her head showing, got hit on the head. Lucie: Whilst dancing to the tunes of Lionel Ritchie's 'Dancing on the Ceiling', the 'Hand' strangles her withthe radio wire Sarah: falling off a cliff Pete: stabbed with a trekking pole Vic: hit on the head by a Corn Beef tin (she's a Vege) Nat & Gronia: Poisoned green porridge Ivan: 'Growth potion' on some leeches (pacat) into man-size. ( It was a few of them in their sleeping bags, hopping around) Ly Mun: By the killer straw hat that sliced him.. Amelia: Gone crazy by Claire's prattling  Initially the UK venturers didn't talk much to the guides, partly language barrier, partly shy. But after awhile we got on just fine. Wonder us having 8 guides for the project had anything to do with  our group having 7 girls?Hmmm...    Phase 3: Community   Kg Gana - Gravity Feed Water System   Brief History   In response to fulfilling the requirements  for access to basic social services for the dispersed Lingkabau communities, Kg Gana was constructed through the social programme of the Forestry Department. As it was logistically and economically not feasible to construct seperate services for each of the dispersed villages, a larger central village was constructed. The infrastructure provided included over 400 detached houses, two churches, primary school, clinic and community centre as well as supporting infrastructure such as toilet blocks, electricity and water.   The pressing issue faced by the community included the lack of access to water. Initially a Deep Well project was completed but the three wells did not supply sufficient amounts per day and unsafe levels of iron and magnesium were identified .  To  overcome unforeseen problems, three alternatives were suggested:  1- Installation of  a three phase submersible pumps 2- Tapping of spring water for the two springs to the north of Kg Gana 3- Tapping of spring water from the streams of the west of Kg Gana and would later directly feed at least four kampungs.   The local community has begun work on the first two options.  Raleigh International participated in the third and most difficult options. Works involved was weir construction, laying of polypipes (digging/ covering where necessary) and fixing pipes and taps at several strategic points along the respectful villages.    Project Partners     Community of Kg Gana  Critical to the success of the project was the involvement of many community members with their time and knowledge and enthusiasm in working together.   PACOS Trust  PACOS Trust works closely with the community by encouraging villages to become involved with the projects. PACOS works throughout Sabah by providing training in community development and advocacy.   Sabah Forestry Department   The Sabah Forestry Department staff were involved in all aspects of the project and contributed to its success. This included site logistics, translation, financial support and the provision of materials to complete the project.    Community Activities    Homestay   The community generously welcomed us to their homes, giving us a glimpse into their daily lives. I had the opportunity to stay  with En Jalis bin Kutin, head of the Evangelical church and Robin, the PACOS representative to Kg Gana respectively.Such an informal setting allowed for more open conversation and gave the villagers and us a chance for cultural exchange while builiding closer rapport. Relationships with the villagers improved immensely after each Homestay.    Memories  En Jalis was so impressed with the postcards Amy gave to him and he was obviously touched by the gifts. I do hope to keep in touch. I think it struck many of us how generous and selfless many of the villagers were during Home stay. To give so much when they have so little. Makes you wonder.   Traditional dancing and weaving   Amy, one of the youths of Kg Gana taught us (Aplha 3)  traditional Kadazan dances such as the sumazao,  popular with the young and old alike.The hand and body movements are toned by a gentle gracefulness brought to life amid the vibrant sounds of the traditional musical accompaniment on brass gongs.   En Gihu, one of the local weavers, took time out to instruct us on weaving using dried rattan. We wove fans, bracelets and rings. He was very patient with us.     Sports Day   Almost fifty kids under twelve years old assembled at the school field for Sports day which we organised. It was trully a challenge to divide the children into three groups and to get them in straight lines. Their excitement and enthusiasm was apparent. We played sack race, wheelbarrow, spoon and egg race, 100m dash and three-legged race. It was such a good day and we rewarded the kids with colourful stickers and lots of sweets and candy.    Memories  I lost my voice that day,and it was such good fun. I tried to involve everybody that day so no one of Alpha 3 felt left out, which I think they sometimes did due to the language barrier. You could see that there were really poor kids and they were the sweetest and shyest as well. But kids are kids and they had good fun. They actually  asked if we were doing it again the next day.    Clearing the Playground   Due to the early completion of the project, we decided to clear the playground which was overgrown with grass and weeds as tall as a man. Villagers assisted us with parangs, grass cutters and hoes  and we finished the task in one afternoon. The reward was the children laughing as they played on the swings and merry-go-rounds.    Teaching English   On several occasions, we  met the primary school children and taught English by playing games with them which they enjoyed immensely. Often times, a few children would wait for us at our temporary kampung house after the working day so they could play with us.  With Adults, one to one mentoring was highly effective and we realised many of the villagers were keen to expland their language proficiency. Many though were shy to approach us, however the more we interacted with the villages through working together on the project, the more open they became to learning English.   Friendly Soccer match   It was a match between Raleigh International and the villages of Kg Gana. Suffice to say the score was 7-1 with Kg Gana as the victors. It was a good laugh- us in our Raleigh T-shirts and numbers stuck on  our backs and the villagers in proper soccer outfits.  We were very proud of scoring at least one goal...     Performances   On our last evening, we decided to put on a pantomime entitled ' Aladdin and the Magic tap' All the boys were dressed as girls and vise versa. The entire performance was as over the top as possible and I was the Malay translator/ narrator. The villagers entertained us with their own dances and traditional music as well as farewell gifts and speeches.     Opening ceremony of the Gravity Water feed System   On the 12 April, Alpha 3 officially turned on the fresh water supply system in a ceremony launched by Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Dr Maximus Ongkili.He thanked Raleigh International for the initiative and urged the villagers to take care of and maintain the new facility.Furthermore he said the government was doing all it could to ensure success of the resettlement scheme, including upgrading the access road to the village and providing economic opportunities for the locals.  "This area has a huge potential and we have identified it to be the producer of organic vegetables for Sabah," he said.  Raleigh International's public relations officer, Phil Bloomfield, said the "venturers" comprising youths, mostly from England and three from Malaysia, had the opportunity to experience life in the remote village.  Article appearing on Bernama. http://bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=60786      Conclusion    - Leadership   Everyday, a different Day Leader (DL) is elected giving every team member an opportunity to lead the team in the daily activities. The respective Project Managers were there to offer support the duration of each phase.  During my first phase, I was DL on the first day and had to organise the forest rangers that would guide us through the Crocker Range. I honed my communication skills, liasing  between the local community  and my team to find the best options. Trying new ways to lead the team was trully a challenge, with such a variety of characters and personalities from each phase. I gained confidence with my abilities and a greater awareness through practice.       - Organisation and Planning  I  enjoy planning and organising and volunteered as Logs officer for the 2nd phase at Danum Valley. My  task was to ensure that we had the right amounts of food for the entire three weeks and the necessary equipment during work days. The experience built my confidence for future endeavours relating  to organising activities or events. I had to learn patience and understanding, build a greater awareness to be patient  with differing opinions then my own which may turn out to be a better alternative.    - Communication  As a Host Country Venturer I had the unique position within the respective teams. Local venturers act as the liason between the local community and the International team members. Often I acted as translator  between the guides at Danum Valley  or representatives from the Forestry Department to relay the daily targets.  Also a bridge between the cultural exchanges with the local community and my team mates.   As a minority within the majority of an International group I found the best way  of communication is to have an objective and open mindset. My interpersonal skills greatly improved and I realised meeting people and making friends is very much owed to one’s own initiative. Not to assume or expect people to come up to me, but rather show an active interest in the individuals themselves. I have made friends for life and had the most interesting conversations, something  that would not occur if I had not sat down next to a team mate and said,’ So, tell me about yourself…’    - Teamwork  With every phase I found that the Venturers worked very well. Once a decision was made and agreed upon by all members, the tasks were completed quickly and efficiently. It was essential that the Day Leader was clear with the targets of the day and to communicate the goals for the day to all team mates. Acknowleding that different people has differing levels of fitness and understanding was also one of the key points on better teamwork. This grew from an awareness that individual members contribute to the team in different ways and to respect   Some Newspaper articles on RI projects     Environmental project:Imbak Valley  http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.php?id=62724&vo=6   Community project: Kg Gana  http://bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=60786    Other projects  http://bernama.com/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=62724   Additional information on Raleigh International UK and Raleigh International KL   http://www.raleighinternational.org.uk http://www.raleighinternational.org.my

      It was my precious off day from work and was relishing the spoils of a promotion, not having to work crazy shift times. All was set for a lazy couch potatoe day - had my Lord of the ring trilogy DVD set, food in the fridge and no one in the apartment.  At times I was moaning and groaning, oh how awful some mundane issue was the worst thing in the world that day.   A text message from my elder sis brought me down to earth. She was feeling very apprehensive about the possibility she may not be able to bear children due to a recent miscarriage. I did feel very very small and selfish.   How easily I had forgotten all that I had seen and experienced whilst at Kg Gana. The lives they lead, how hard and yet they remain happy. I here in my oh so comfotable existence. I felt humbled.   Funny...
