      another one bites the dust....... one more day down the drain. today i took some one for giving a driving test....and not surprisingly he passed. i m getting pretty good at this. the only highlight of todays day is that I made a good investment. after my DECK....this is my 2'nd investment..i bought a tennnis racket for 25 $. is pretty costly..but looked pretty good. i wanna pick up this game. my leg is still aching.....hope i will be in a position to play. ate too may chocolates today...having a severe stomach ache now. k...it is 3 in the night...time for mme to go and sleep....

      met my advisor today...felt bad as i hadnt done much work. i surely will see to it that it doesnt happen again. the best part of today's day was the football match between Dr. zoughi's and Dr. pommeranke's research grp. Thanks to rohan..i play with Zoughi's grp. we tried to play ur best game.... but those guys turned out to be much better than us as expected. They drubbed us 8-2. but stacey and jesse played a good game...i m sure we will give them a run for their money next time around. its just that we aint used to playing on a full length ground and so got tired real fast. on a sad note.... I sprained my ankle. hope it recovers fast. i have decided to go to india this december...have to start saving atleast some money by then. but the way i m spending money....i think i will be in debt. tried to call ketan..my friend who stays in my colony back in india..wasnt home i guess. hes in arizona for 2 months as AMEX has sent him on some training. feeling tired now..playing football for 2 hrs. byeeeeeeeeee

Dr ragsdell is fundu.. he has been consutant to CEO of companies like FORD, XEROX, IBM etc. hes ver knowledgavle...and so when he talks its very impressive. i always like people who give fundaes. its a good change from my regular techie courses. havent played for some days. in my life i have reached a stage when i lose enthu...this happens to me sometimes ... good part is i bounce back. nowadays also these is happening... hope enthu comes back soon to work. having taken the responsibility of secretary of india association...also aint a easy job. takes so much time of me..just replying to emails and arranging for pickup of all new students. not to mention about diwali...dunno whether i can manage all this. i have decided to cut down on expenses a bit. should not go out to eat i guess. today is reshma's visa. hope she gets it.   k then...tomo morning i have  a test..:-( . ciao

      today am very tired... played soccer for 2 1/2 hrs.  Dr pommeranke team is pretty good. Those chinkis can run for anything...and the italians are just plain good. but we are improving with every game.... soon we will defeat them. summer is really bad...u just dont feel like working. my course is surely gonna screw me...it starts from next week. he's sent a set of rules to be followed...Dr Ragsdell looks very organised. but what the heck... i m sure i will manage something. Six sigma looks interesting...how i want to get into this kind of feild. just feel that i m not a techie kind of guy. k then....ciaoooooooo

      Today i won the Intramural tournament organised by UMR. basicallly it has all the associations on campus including the frats, chinese and thai associations. I was the representative for ISC (international students club).  i defeated a chinese fellow in the finals.. this guy whom i defeated tried every possible way to cheat. i am dead tired now..having played some 7 matches in a row. he on the other hand was very fresh for the finals. but well....i did pretty well and screwed him. he beat me once.. 7- 11, 11-6, 11-8.  then i won 2 more matches against him  11-2 , 11-3  and  11-7, 11-7  ...am very happy defeating him. I dont get personal while playing any game..but today i did. today praghna akka had her finals for Gladrags Mrs. India contest. dunno whats the outcome of it.  its gonna be aired on SONY TV on 30'th i guess..dont want to miss it.  i will go and call now.

      been nearly 3-4 months since i wrote. time has been a bit harsh and also a lot of fun. about the bad part..have not been studying properly for quite some time now...and may get a first 'B' in my course. feel bad as i was just 2 courses away from maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA.  other than tht..this has been a hectic and a fun filled week. all the efforts put for DIWALI celebrations finally paid off yesterday. It was celebrated in Castleman Hall. This is one of the biggest auditoriums in UMR which was needed since nearly 1200 people turned up for the event. Yesterday the show was awesome. we finished all our 700 odd tickets in 15 miutes time. The response was spectacular. The first half of the show which had a theme show was nothing less than professional. people couldnt believe this was done by students and not professionals. and then to the best part of the evening... we had made food for nearly 1000 odd people. some 7 dishes with 2 chicken... chicken tikka and cashew chicken. the food was better than any restaurant i have had food in US. believe me...u had to be there to taste that food.  I was involved in Publicity for the event....also was responsible for bringing in sponsors. I guess my publivity went off well as in the 1200 odd people for the first time there were more americans than indians. They complimented us a lot for the efforts. Also we being the only organisation on campus which has no entry fees sets us apart. personally i liked the job  a lot as i was the one who has to take care of chancellor ,provost , chief guest ,etc etc. this surely helped my confidence and also was a great experience for me.   as i said....all well's that ends well. check www.umr.edu/~india for pics. Thanks a lot to everyone who helped in making the event a grand success.  Cheers  P.s i slept for nearly 12 hrs today :)

      Been some time since I wrote... Pretty bored nowadays. Wanna get done with my MS soon and get on with a job in the industry. Let's see what happens.... job scene is so bad nowadays. Dont feel like working at all sitting in front of my comp. Just was wondering the other day....how monotonous my life has become. Movies... Games.....and Comp. I spend so much time in front of a comp .... if i utilize the time i waste on surfing.. I am sure I can do wonders.  anyways... thats the way it is. As one says... old habits die hard. I needed to find a enthu grp who go for treks and stuff like that.. missouri is so beautiful..i feel bad that I havent even explored it. lets see... have to muster all that is left of me and finish my thesis for now .  anyways, will post if something interesting happens. My bro might come to kansas for a week or two this month...looking forward to meeting him.

      just read abt the fire in tamil nadu killing 90 kids.. i wonder sometimes till when will such things go on in India without people doing something abt it. Apparently the fire escape were virtually non-existant in the building. Jayalalitha will say... we will look into it..and as always people will forget all abt it. One thing I like abt US is...even if one person dies...they actually do something abt it..or atleast make a conscious attempt to do something. Just wonder what parents might be feeling when they realize their kids who went to school will never return.... &nbsp; anyways... will be going for canoeing tomorrow. looking forward to&nbsp; that..last yr when we had gone.. some people were actually in grave danger of drowning..... thanks to heavy rains the previous day..... the flow was very strong. But it was an experience which i will remember for a long time. Some things are hard to erase from ur memory..like my first trekking trip .... was the scariest ever. just thinking abt it..... scares me. :) and the bhimashankar trip with my engg. buddies where we climbed ladders kept there since there was no route to walk.&nbsp; these are things which we regret while we are doing... but after its over u really are proud of urself :). hope tomorrow will be fun as well..if not anything some good looking babes are coming ....lol. &nbsp; chalo then.....  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
