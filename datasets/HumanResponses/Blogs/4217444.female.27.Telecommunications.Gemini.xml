        Written by Steve Estes &amp; Joni Eareckson Tada "On your back with you!" One raises a mallet to sink the spike. But the soldier’s heart must continue pumping as he ready’s the prisoner’s wrist. Someone must sustain the soldier’s life minute by minute, for no man has this power on his own. Who supplies breath to his lungs? Who gives energy to his cells? Who holds his molecules together? Only by the Son do "all things hold together" (Colossians 1:17). The victim wills that the soldier live on - he grants the warriors continued existence. The man swings. As the man swings, the Son recalls how he and the Father first designed the medial nerve of the human forearm – the sensations it woud be capable of. The design proves flawless – the nerve performs exquisitely. "Up you go!" They lift the cross. God is on display [naked] and can scarecely breathe. But these pains are a mere warm up to his other and growing dread. He begins to feel a foreign sensation. Somewhere during this day an unearthly foul odor began to waft, not around his nose, but his heart. He feels dirty. Human wickedness starts to crawl upon his spotless being – the living excrement from our souls. The apple of his Father’s eye turns brown with rot. His Father! He must face his Father like this! From heaven the Father now rouses himself like a lion disturbed, shakes his mane, and roars against the shriveling remnant of a man hanging on a cross. Never has the Son seen the Father look at him so, never felt even the least of his hot breath. But the roar shakes the unseen world and darkens the visible sky. The Son does not recognize these eyes. "Son of Man! Why have you behaved so? You have cheated, lusted, stolen, gossiped – murdered, envied, hated, lied. You have cursed, robbed, overspent, overeaten – fornicated, disobeyed, embezzled, and blasphemed. Oh, the duties you have shirked, the children you have abandoned! Who has ever so ignored the poor, so played the crowed, so belittled my name? Have you ever held your razor tounge? What a selfrightious, pitiful drunk – you, who molest young boys, peddle killer drugs, travel in cliques, and mock your parents. Who gave you the boldness to rig elections, foment revolutions, torture animals, and worship demons? Does the list never end! Splitting families, raping virgins, acting smugly, playing the pimp – buying politicians, practicing exhortation, filming pornagraphy, accepting bribes. You have burned down buildings, perfected terrorist tactics, founded false religions, traded in slaves – relishing each morsal and bragging about it. I hate, loathe these things in you! Disgust for everything about you consumes me! Can you not feel my wrath?" Of course the Son is innocent. He is blamelessness itself. The Father knows this. But the divine pair have an agreement, and the unthinkable must now take place. Jesus will be treated as if personally responsible for every sin evver commited. The Father watches as his heart’s treasure, the mirror-image of himself, sinks drowning into raw, liquid sin. Jehovah’s stored rage against humankind from every century explodes in a single direction. "Father! Father! Why have you forsaken me?!" But heaven stops its ears. The Son stares up at the One who cannot, who will not, reach down to reply. The Trinity has planned. The Son endured it. The Spirit enabled him. The Father rejected the Son whom he loved. Jesus, the God-man from Nazareth, perished. The Father accepted his sacrifice for sin and was satisfied. The Rescue was accomplish. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes the rescue was complete, the vail of seperation from God was ripped in two, but who will accept it? Who will choose to believe something they never had to personally see and witness? But then who would knowingly reject the offer of salvation and count Christ’ sacrifice as a vain effort to redeam us from that horrific fate? How will people know unless they are told and how will they be told unless we open our mouths and not refrain from humiliation should our words be rejected? It’s not what we say that people reject, however the heroic hand extened, held lovingly out with commpassion and forgiveness still marked with nail scars.
