      The beautiful city, the city of hurried and sparkling waters! The city of spires and masts! The City nested in bays! my city! The city of such women, I am mad with them! I will return after death to be with them! The city of such young men, I swear I cannot live happy without I often go talk, walk, eat, drink, sleep with them!   WALT WHITMAN  no, i dont live in new york city - yet. yes, i might as well live there for all the time i spend there. one day soon i'll finally do it.  but this isnt a blog about that. this is merely to serve as a place to keep a list of the things that i want to do in new york city... BEYOND  the typical tourist stuff (although i seriously wouldnt mind a trip to the top of the Empire State Building..it's been THAT long).  there are so many things that this place has to offer and i dont take advantage of it nearly enough. so this summer i decided i'm gonna go beyond what i know of the city. seek to learn and experience more than that which i already know. i'm realistic, i know a lot of it wont actually happen because the temptation just to lay out on my deck will override the desire to do anything else, but that's okay. at least here i'll have my constant reminder. my list.

      *sigh*  unwillingly and through no fault of his own, he kills me. by his words, by his thoughts, by his longing, by his heart... that's what caused me to fall, and it's what causes me to hang on. i never met anybody like him and he'll say until the day he dies that he's just a man (and he is, with faults like anybody else) - but i hope that one day he can see for himself the incredible qualities that he possesses.  even after all this time, i am still be amazed by him.  it's the writers. the poets. the dreamers. my weakness. and despite the fact that it's those people who break my heart into a million pieces, it's those same people who encourage me to look within myself and trust who i am, to believe in the soul and to take notice of the beauty that surrounds us all. i could never give that up - despite the cost to my heart.

      talking is a blessing and a curse.   blessing because i've so missed the banter. i love that we have somewhat moved beyond the 'superficial pleasantries' or my personal favorite: ""carefully chosen yet sincere inquiries." i love remembering that we can still talk open and honestly. i love laughing again by something we're talking about. i just love having my friend back.  but it's a curse. it's a curse because all i want to do is cry out that i dont want to just chit chat. that i want more. that i havent stopped wanting more since day one. it's a curse because i want the friendship back, and as much as i want it back, i dont know if i can ever forget and go back to just being friends. it's a curse because i havent stopped loving. not one bit. not in the midst of such anger, of such bitterness, of such...resignation, i havent stopped at all.   how in the world am i gonna get over this? and how long is it gonna take?

      god, it's all just sadness disguised as anger. it's hurt disguised as frustration. it's the result of denial biting you in the ass. it's the sadness of missing your best friend. it's the realization that it's just  not gonna happen.  it's the anger at yourself for still hoping, believing, that one day it still can. it's just missing you so much sometimes that you cant see straight. it's missing the great conversations. it's missing the silly conversations. it's missing calling you at night just to say goodnight. it's missing the stupid emails about the most inane things just because i needed entertainment. it's missing the all day long IMing marathons. it's missing the mush face. it's missing the comfort of knowing you were just a phone call away. it's missing the euphoria. it's missing the hope. it's missing the possibility. it's missing the struggle, the fighting for the possibility of happieness. lol..it's missing you trying to get off the phone, but you staying on because i needed that one last cigarette. it's missing you making fun of me. it's missing how you could make me laugh..oh how you could make me laugh.  it's just missing being able love you, and telling you so. it's just..missing.  you.    i may be dwelling. hell yes, i'm dwelling. you must sit there praying that i just  let it go , but you filled my heart up more than i thought it could anymore. and now that's gone..it's been gone, and i still dont know how the hell to let go of you.

      i need this weekend with my girls. i need to get back on track. i need to remember that things dont ALWAYS have to be so dramatic. i just need them. i need to laugh and not be reminded all the time that he didnt love me. it seems like everywhere i turn there is a reminder and i just need to be isolated from it for a bit. i'm never gonna get over it if i dont.  i'm angry. i'm so angry. i want to scream FUCK YOU WORLD but that's not very ladylike or appropriate, is it? you cant begrudge somebody for feeling the way they do, but sometimes, you dont care about being rational. you hurt. you're in so much pain you cant see straight..and everybody is telling you to get over it already. stop harping on it. stop thinking about it. well fuck you too, i dont work that way. i loved with every fiber in me. i had hope. i was led to believe that there was a reason for hope and whatever the reason is for ending it, you still can be f'ing angry. this is me. i'm sorry. i dont get over things easily. ever.  i'm sorry that 2 months later it can still hurt as much as it did the night it ended. i'm sorry that i still entertain thoughts of happieness. SO SUE ME WORLD. I DONT GIVE A SHIT. this is me. this is why i am able to love so wholeheartedly.  you give your everything to something, somebody, it's gonna hurt as FUCK when it's gone.    the shitty part of it all? no matter how angry i can be at this moment, i still love you.  i'm fucking ridiculous.  ahh fuck you world. i'm gonna sit at a friend's house this weekend, smoke myself into oblivion and forget that anything outside those 4 walls exist.

       stupid.    night lift up the shades let in the brilliant light of morning · but steady me now for i am weak and starving for mercy · sleep has left me alone to carry the weight of unraveling where we went wrong · and all i can do to hang on, to keep me from falling into old familiar shoes · · how stupid could i be · a simpleton could see · that you're no good for me · but you're the only one i see · · love has made me a fool set me on fire and watched as i floundered · unable to speak except to cry out and wait for your answer  · and you come around in your time speaking of fabulous places create an oasis that dries up as soon as you're gone · you leave me here burning in this desert without you · · how stupid could i be · a simpleton could see · that you're no good for me · but you're the only one i see · · everything changes everything falls apart · i can't stand to feel myself losing control · in the deep of my weakness i know · · how stupid could i be · a simpleton could see · that you're no good for me · but you're the only one i see

       I knew I was never gonna talk to you tomorrow  And oh, the birds how they sing  If you were a bird could you sing me a song of sorrow  'Cause all I know from you is grief  But I never wanted to be your rolling train   I never wanted to be your dancin' shoes  I just wanted you to love me  I just wanted you to love me  Touch, feel & lose  And cry, cry, cry   I thought maybe I could be some kind of shelter  But oh, your storm how it raged  You know your kisses, they like lightnin' and thunder  And your smile is sweet and come down like rain   I never wanted to be your dancin' shoes  I just wanted you to love me  I just wanted you to love me  Touch, feel & lose  And cry, cry, cry  I just wanted you to love me, honey  Cry, cry, cry  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "Weather Channel"  Sunny morning You can hear it Siren's warning There is weather on both sides And I know it's coming Just like before There's a black dog That scratches my door He's been growling my name saying You better get to running Can you make it better for me Can you make me see the light of day Because I got no one Who will bring me a Big umbrella So I'm watching the weather channel And waiting for the storm It's just sugar Just a pill to make me happy I know it may not fix the hinges But at least the door has stopped it's creaking I got friends They're waiting for me to comb out my hair Come outside and join the human race But I don't feel so human Can you make it better for me Can you make me see the light of day Because I got lab coats Who will bring me a panacea While I'm watching the weather channel Waiting for the storm You won't want me Hanging around the birthday pony Even though it's just a game You know we are the same But you're the better faker.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Sometimes lonely is not only a word But faces I have known And if you see me could you free me with a smile So I can let go

      the email that i sent. HAD to send:  it's come to my realization that i cant do this. i cant. i cant play the part of friend. i cant pretend that every email we send each other doesnt kill me. i cant pretend that nothing is wrong when one look at my blog and we know something is definitely very wrong. i cant pretend that i still understand anything. i cant pretend that i still blame myself. i cant pretend that i'm really starting to hate myself more than anything else in this whole thing..hating myself for not getting over it quick enough. hating myself for emailing when i know i shouldnt. hating myself for still letting my fantasies go to a place that will never exist. you closed the book on you and i a long time ago and i can barely even turn a page. i hate myself for being so pathetic. for feeling like a puppy dog following your every step. but you've moved on. i need to. this is never gonna happen. i keep thinking if i repeat that enough times it'll get through, and sometimes i think it does, but then i'll email you, hear something about you, anything, and i know i'm not over this, i know it's not fully recognized in my head.  i dont know what to do anymore. i've tried everything and not one damn thing works. i'm just so sick of being sad all the time. i'm sick of being angry. i'm sick of holding onto something that i have no business holding onto. you made your decision, that is abundantly clear, and now i need to just get on with it. listen to what everybody has been telling me and shut my own damn brain off bcs it's not helping one iota. it's done. it's done. it's done. it's done.  deal with it luciana.   so in order for me to deal with it, i have to stop this. i have to stop the emails. i have to stop the pleasentries. i dont know what's worse: pretending that i'm fine, or me saying that i'm not and it being ignored. so that's it. i'm cutting myself off from you. i need to feel whole again and i cant do that if i'm friends with you. not now. not for awhile. not for who knows how long. there's nothing in this world that i'd rather not do bcs you have essentially been my touchstone for so long, but what the hell kind of friendship do we have now? it's a joke. it's understandable, but it's a joke. and i cant risk my heart and my sanity anymore for passing pleasantries. not anymore. i've just sunked so low into myself and i'm honestly scared that i'm getting so deep i cant get out. that's not me. i want to breathe. i want to smile. i want to not wake up every morning and go to bed every night thinking this.  you may think it's ridiculous and it probably is. i dont know how many times mimi yelled at me for crying over something that, "in the end, never even actually came to be." but fuck, to me it was real. to me it was all very very very real and so close to me. and it's taking so much time to let it go and i'm the only one standing in my way of doing just that.   so i'm sorry, but i have to end this now. i need somehow get rid of this hurt bcs i hate what i'm turning into. i hate it, but i guess this truly is the only way to do this.

WHY? WHY? WHY?  fuck you.  and by you i mean me.

       Oh I said, I was driving with a friend just the other day  Down the sea an old man wrote a book and told a good story   So we sat and sipped the wine with him  We sat and had a good good time  And listened to wisdom of the old  'Cause they know what's on the line    "It's a good good time tonight"  Sitting there he said,  "It's a good thing to have good friends  Young and old the same."    Don't believe what ya say  Well style's ok, but you've got your style of your own  Don't listen to the tv, just make your own way home.    Its a good time tonight  Come maybe with you  And don't believe there's a light that's brighter  Than the one that shine's from you.    You're a good good time  A good time tonight, for sure  And roll up your feeling, let the whole thing roll on    It's got a bit of soul, got a bit of soul  Got a bit of soul in everyone  I'm telling you friend, telling you friend,  You got to shine on shine on.  Gotta shine on, shine on, yeah  Shine on, shine on.    He said that the brightest thing is the things at the borders  And you hear one thing, said  This is right sometimes you hear this is wrong  But in your heart you know  The truth it always shine on    Difference says between you and me  Ah, but they can lie down  'Cause the wine taste good  And the dance is feelin' fine, fine, fine     Cuz we got a good good time tonight  And we're gonna have it here  Always good good friends your coming  Lay it on me.  Lay it all on me.  Lay it on me.   Don't worry about what's on your mind.  Feel alright here tonight  It's a good good time tonight  It's all a waste  Fill your head with good things  Fill your head my friend     Hope we don't start  Hope we don't start  The stars stay forever  I hope that I do too  Here tonight with ya'll  Here tonight with you   So cry cry cry, if that's what makes you  And laugh laugh laugh, if that's what does it to you  Cry cry cry, if that's what you need to  And laugh laugh laugh, if you in the mood  Cry cry cry, if that's what you got to do  And laugh laugh laugh, if you want me to  Cry cry cry, if that's what you got to  Laugh. Laugh. Laugh.

      Okie dokie folks... Here's what we've got so far...   The Car!  -Explorer... estimated 3-Day Rental total (with tax): $285.69  Here's how it breaks down...      Wayland researched hotels and found the Embassy Suites Seattle Tacoma Airport.        *Marjorie... it would be great if we could all be at the same hotel for much-more-fun and for caravaning purposes, no?  (Spoken from a Gorge Virgin)  WOO HOO!  It's getting closer... I can't wait!

      Okay..i'm back in planning mode and trying to figure shit out.  Wayland..i understand you booked the car. Can you post how much it was and how much we all owe?  Same for the hotel?  Also, I realized today that on Sunday Mimi is picking up the rental car for our trip, and yet, at the same time, i'll have the car we rented for the gorge. Not to be a pain in the butt, but is there some way we can figure out the pricing for that since i wont be utilizing the car monday? If not, not a big deal..just trying to watch my pennies.  woohoo! exactly a month from now we'll be tailgating! yay!
