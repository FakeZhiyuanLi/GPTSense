      I'm actually able to do this, that's nice. It's been all crazy on me the past few days so I gave up. But now I see I can write on this..  Let me begin. This weekend is going to be the worst in my life even though a few days ago I thought it was going to be the best. My friend Martin and his wife and kid came to visit from Stuttgart. He was a friend of mine before he moved there last year, but a friend of my sister's before that. Anyway, I called my sister earlier this week and let her know he was comming, so then my sister said she'd fly down from London for the weekend too. Then she went and told me some crap that I don't feel like getting into which led into something big yesterday that I don't feel like getting into either. Long story short, my sister is down and she brought her dog, which I am supposed to take care of as she frollicks around town with her old friends and stays in the house of an old boyfriend. Martin and his wife/kid unit are down here, leaving me with their kid tomorrow afternoon so they can frollick around town with my sister. My sister is mad at me, my best friend has a very strange view of me and will actually admit to it for the first time in his life.. I'll get into that later as Francis has yet to hear of it. And of course, Gretchen broke up with me. So I am not at all in a good mood, and considering that everytime I see my sister she gives me the worst look, I'll be watching a kid for a few hours and I hate kids, and this stupid dog keeps bitting my toes, this bad mood is not looking to improve anytime soon.  On to Tom for Francis. A little after you left for the movie I decided to call Tom even though it was like 1:30. I wanted to ask him if he'd like to do anything tomorrow in the morning and if he wants to come over to help me watch this kid. He said he would and then he started asking me about my sister and all the Gretchen crap. So I told him all of what my sister had said to me today. Anyway, after a little moment of silence Tom went on to tell me all of my flaws and how for the first time in our friendship, he can't quite turn the other cheek to them. Maybe he was just tired and in a cranky mood that I called him or maybe he's just reached the point where he's tired of ignoring my bad side.. something I've often wondered how he can do. So I don't know... I talked to him for about 30 minutes or so and I left feeling really crummy. And the worst part of all of this is, usually when Tom or my sister is upset with me, it's over nothing and I can yell and scream at them and walk off feeling better. But this time around, they are all making valid points and comments that I deserve, so I'm taking it all kind of hard.  I told my sister that I was going to go over to Gretchen's tomorrow to try to talk to her.. like I said, just so that she doesn't leave hating my guts. It would be nice to end on a good note for once in my life.. or to at least be able to say my apologies to her. Anyway, when I told my sister that she told me not to dare go over there and to stay away and "leave the girl in peace". That may not sound as harsh reading this, but when it was said after a few really hurtful comments that, again, I completely deserved, I felt like complete shit. I mean, I don't know how to word this.. Today was just an odd day for me emotionally. Usually I get angry all the time, every day.. That's how I deal with people saying things to me or whatver, I get angry. I don't know. Today I wasn't angry at all. I think it was just a bunch of guilt. And everytime someone said something to me I put more and more of it on my shoulders. So by the end of the day I felt like I was carrying a huge burden. Then I talked to Francis and like usual, I felt pretty good during then, but I think she knew that by the end of it I was just spaced out and off on something else. And then when I called Tom it felt like all that weight just came crashing down on me and I was stuck there under this pile of guilt.  I'm confused because I don't ever carry around guilt like that. A few hours at the most.. But this time it feels like I'm crushed by it. Part of me wants to wallow in it or whatever, like it sounds like I'm doing on this. I guess feel sorry for myself because I feel like this when I never do. I blame that on Francis and her friend Tara for feeling bad for me haha... The only people who haven't yelled at me. But the other part of me knows I should feel like this and to just deal with it, accept it. You should feel guilty when you do bad things. I need to stop trying to squirm out of it like I always do and just accept the responsibility and the guilt that comes with it. But I really don't know what I'm doing or talking about. It's almost 3, I'm drunk, tired, and depressed. I mean, I can deal with Gretchen's anger, I really can.. I can deal with my sister's even though that's a little harder, but I can't deal with Tom's. I take him for granted. All the shit I've done to Tom.. and for him to always be there for me the next day with a big grin on his face. It's hard to think that the past few days have made him view me differently. I think that's what it is. It's not that I can deal with Gretchen's or my sister's anger, it's that I'm used to it. They already think I'm a dick. But with Tom, he really thought pretty highly of me and now, he doesn't. I mean.. hmm I don't even know how to word all of this, but I talked to him and he said it himself. So that's what upsets me the most.  Anyway, the only person that I've gotten mad at today is myself, and that little prick deserves it as we all can tell you.   For some sad, disgusting reason I'm not only listening to, but singing along to (which makes me even more freaked out and disgusted with myself than before):  Three Dog Night - The Lion Sleeps Tonight.    Oh my god.. kill me.

      Well my day was very busy. I stayed up with Francis all night and morning again, as usual. But today was different because I had to go to work..&nbsp; I hate going to work. Anyway, because of the conversation with Francis,&nbsp; cough, cough, ahem... excuse me.. ahem, um...&nbsp; I had a big stupid smile on my face all day, even though she told me not to. Don't worry Francis, I still yelled and was all around a terrible force with the actors today. I just happened to have a dumb smile on my face the whole time.   Anyway, so I got home from work and decided to run a few errands.. which is always fun. As if, like oh my god. And then after that I came home and found that Gretchen had called, so I decided to be nice and call her back heh. Anyway, she invited me over for dinner and I accepted. When I got to her apartment, I confronted her about the chewing thing. She told me that she loves how I can find something annoying about every person I know. Yes Gretchen, I love that about myself too. But the chewing thing has got to stop. So I watched her chew her sandwich for an hour or so and then all was forgiven and forgotten.   Ahem, being the hot man beast that I am, I had to take a shower when I got home, but as I was about to, Francis came on. So I, ever&nbsp;the gentleman,&nbsp;made her wait for me to take my shower before I started talking to her. Now she's gone to clean her house and I'm sitting here drinking and playing on this.   I also got a call from an old friend of mine today, I met him when I first came to live in Vienna, but he moved to Stuttgart with his wife and&nbsp;son last year. Anyway, he's comming back to Vienna to vist with his friends and his wife's family who still are here. And they're bringing the child. That thing. I'm deciding if I should just be all out snotty to the little bugger or play nice, make it trust me, and then do something awful to it. It hurts more that way, I think. It's about 4 I think.. It's talking now I hear. Oh boy. But I have to remember to get a picture with it so Francis can see what a wonderful father I  am &nbsp; er... would make.   The novelty of this is going to wear off soon, so I guess I better enjoy it while I can. Yes, yes... Oh and after looking at Francis' thingy and the one of her friend, I decided mine is lacking on thing. The so cool, music of the moment. I just need to think of a cool way to put it.....    I'm rocking out to:  Claude Debussy's Children's Corner.

      Dear 12 year old girls,  I have been thinking about you lately. You are the whole reason I got the internet. The whole reason I joined bolt. For you. Yes, you. I have spent many days and even more nights waiting for notes or emails from you.   But they never came.   Why? Why do you hate me so, all you 12 year old girls? Am I too short? Is it because I'm German? Perhaps it's because I'm 24. But what is age but a number? I mean.. so what if I'm twice your age.. aren't I allowed to love you?   Anyway... your refusial to talk with me has done some good.  Francis. Is. Cool.  Even though she's much too old for me.  She is still cool.   So 12 year old girls were the reason I joined the internet and then got on to some crappy teen website (even though I'm far from being a teen).... but Francis is the reason I'm on this. And why I stayed on the internet after you little skanks refused me.   Francis, this is so awkward. I feel so stupid. Mook.

      Yesterday had nothing to do with 12 year old girls. But it still was a cool day.  I spent the whole night talking to Francis as usual. But that's ok because Francis is so cool. Heh. Anyway, after she got off I started to get ready to go out with Tom for lunch. And then at noon, I met him for lunch.   I'm writting this, but I can't help but to think how broing it must be for people to read this. But then I realize that in thinking that I'm being egotistical because, who in hell is actually going to read this? Francis will. But she already knows all of this. So then, like she said about her's, this is more for me than you, the reader. So shut up and don't let me catch you complaining.   So Tom, as usual bought me lunch. I never buy anything, I'm cheap. I'm poor. Whatever.    And not only do I feel like an egotistical asshole for writting all of this... I'm starting to sound angsty too...    &nbsp; Anyway. So I got free lunch. I talked about anger issues and Gretchen with Tom. We then moved on to lighter hearted topics like the lesbian who I danced with the other night, and little kids. Francis doesn't this.... nor will she ever.  So after lunch I went home and waited around for a while. I chedcked to see if Francis was online, but she wasn't so I sat around. Then I got a phone call. Some of my friends wanted to go and play football (soccer, you Americans)....  Oh god here comes the snotty European to add to the angsty egomaniac.  So yes. I won the game. I was the football god. I was very happy, but when I look at the time I realized I didn't have time to go home and change or wash up before my date with Gretchen. So I went straight to the restuarant. Anyway, Gretchen wasn't happy with me being muddy and scuffed up on our date, and she didn't hesitate to tell me I looked like shit.    Oh boy Francis, here comes all the bitching I spare you from .   Gretchen is a bitch. Heh. For real. But for some reason I put up with her....  This is so angsty . Um.. Why the hell am I comming off so angsty!    This makes me mad. I swear to god I'm not angsty. I hope.    So yes. I had dinner with Gretchen. I told her all about my fantastic athletic skills all night and she kind of looked at me funny. I did happen to notice that she chews an insane amount of time before she swallows her food. That was annoying me to be honest. Why would you need to chew a piece of salad 60 times before you swallow it? She must have been trying to piss me off. For real. Like seriously. Oh my god, what a bitch. Heh.  So after she paid for dinner, I love getting everything for free, we went back to her house. I stayed there for a little while. You know.. heh. wink wink. Hubba hubba. Yes.... hmm... So it went down like that. What a fabulous day. And then I came home, started drinking and decided since my story of having football skills didn't impress Gretchen, I ought to try them on Francis. And it worked. She thinks I'm manly. Heh... manly.    Yes Oliver.. You're so clever. Way to end this. Just be thankful that it's only Francis who's reading this. And she already thinks you're weird.    Yes... excellent.
