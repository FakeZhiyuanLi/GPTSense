            I just got home from the state swim meet.  But that is not what is on my mind right now...i found out that 2 of my friends called me a bitch...o well it shouldn't bother me that much but it did..i know why steph did(im sry that i was being so mean to you hun!!im really sorry!!!)but i dont know why robbie did...but im sure i deserved it but o well.  I  just told josh that i think i want to break up with him...but something in my head(and a couple of friends) told me to give it some more time...so that is what im doing...but i still feel horrible.  I have something funny to say i just don't want to say it because i am too sad right now...well i better go before i say anything i don't want to...ttyall later...

             I'm about to go out to eat with my mom for her birthday.  She is old! lol     Well I'm not sure what I should do about this problem I have cause I think I like someone but I don't want to hurt someone else who likes me.  If that makes any sense to you..congradulations to you.     Josh told me that I need to grow up more so that I can make commitments. But i am only 14(almost 15 YAY!)  But I had better get of the comp before my rents get mad at me for not doing my homework yet...lol...BUH BYES!

          la de da de do de da...               I'm just sitting here trying not to be so bored.  I talked to a bunch of people today.  Me and Josh had another disagreement...about what I'm still not sure.  O well.  But he said that Ryan told him to just break up with me.  I know that Josh wants to do it, I just don't know if he knows that he wants to.  But he is foing to do what he wants to do and I'm not going to tell him what he should do.  Well i better be going.  I need my sleep.

       I feel a little better today...Everything is still just a little bit...Weird but im sure I'll figure it out.              But yesterday while we were at Arby's(we includes Ryan Wildes, his mom, my mom, my sis, and me) this bush outside the restraunt caught on fire. We were thinking ok someone must have thrown a lit cigarette in it. The manager walked out with the fire extinguisher thingy and put it out. When she walked back behind the counter,I heard one of the employees ask her if the cigarette theory was right. The manager answered, "No it was the same bush that caught on fire the last few times." Needless to say I don't want to go there again.                                                                                I'm outtie! buh bye
