      Woke up at 12pm.. realised that it's sunday, and my brain persauded me body to go back for some snoozes. Snooze 1 lasted for 1hr, dreamt about some 'good stuffs', its those kinda dreams where u can explicity control. Brilliant!Nevertheless, i woke up, then by the time i managed to get out of bed, its 3pm already. You must be wondering,"knn, this lazy arsehole, sleep the whole day away". Wtf.. i live alone and i was on phone wif friend for 2hrs, i think i deserved the late-wake up.  Went to school and print my exam/tute notes. I had $16.20 before i printed, and when i finished, i am left with $4.10. Each copy costs 10c. Whole lot of readings to do. siao liao One of my lecturers said getting a PA in her subject is not hard, but getting a CR,DI or even HD is like trying to lick ur own elbow. I was extremely disturbed by what she said. I am going to prove her wrong man. No efforts will be spared. ccb. I hate pple that undermine one's capabilities.  That's it.

      Met up With Jon, Alena and Inge @ Nike at 1930hrs. Today's propaganda. Good Food!. So as usual, Inge never fails to bring us to places that have good food.  We ate @ Sen Bar its an Korean restaurant along Exhibition St, between lt Bourke and Lonsdale st. We had  Dumplings  OMG! the skin is so thin.. its handmade(as said by Inge), the first bite is so divine that your eyes will close in absolute bliss.  Rice Cakes  Its hot. its what i i can say.. BUT.. we brave the 12deg cel weather for good food. Ah, all in a day's work...  calamari with chilli, onion, carrots(hot)  Its hot too.by the 9th squid portion i am eating, i was already feeling beads of perspiration, falling in on my forehead.But... Ah, all in a days work. Absolutely paradisaical.  mini steamboat  Well, this consists of mushies, carrots, radish, marinated beef, rubbery "dong fen"(chinese) and some other stuffs which i can't remember off my head.  And to make our dinner a 9.5/10, there was this Korean wine(13.5%)alc, its brewed with ginseng,and some other herbs. can't remember 'em all. But its nice. The reason why -0.5, coz i bump my head against the counter while trying to pick up scarf that dropped on the ground.  Crown Casino  We took a cab that cost us $6.30 in total, shared by the 4 of us, so each of us shared and we saved 80c, if we were to take a tram to crown.  Green tea, Sesame ice cream  OmG! ABsolutely sinful, but what the heck. i am goind to do my usual routine of pushies and sitties later when i get home. Tactic employed: Breakeven Okie. that's all for now.

      3 days ago, I went marketing with Jon and his gf Alena to Safeway, to get some groceries.  Saw this girl also queuing up @ the cashier line. She has this very nice back view, long hair, nice side profile(the type of girl I am looking for)  Suddenly, she turned around, and that action of her, made me go weak on my knees and my eyes were still glued on her. She has that smile that could turn a bad weather day into a sunny day. I think she's from Singapore, judging by her accent.  She was wearing this red jacket with black bottoms. Think she looks like one of the Jap movie star. Wonder if she's attached. U goon! of coz I think she is. What's a pretty girl like her, being unattached in this world?  Will try to get a pic of her ASAP.

      Today i woke up at 1330hrs, brushed teeth and suddenly i thought of blog after one of my best friend(med)'s sister(tracy) asked me about blog stuffs. So I decided to copy and paste all my txt files into a blog and just see how far can i bring my blog to.  I know i am a damn late starter in this blog bandwagon, but my thoughts in my mind has been overwhelming and running out of disk space. Blog is one hell'a good avenue to store my thoughts that are over-spewing.  Having spend majority of my life as an individual has certainly shaped my thinking about life. For instance, in my 2.5yrs stint as a student in foreign land, living by myself, managing my lifestyle, has distort my teenage' idealistic ambition.  Therefore, in these few blogs, i am frantically typing away, what's left on my memory bank, in hope to revive and relocate some memory survivals. Constantly, whenever I needed that spiritual morale boosting, my dad, mum and sister appears in my mind, using them as role models to finish up what i set out to complete 2.5 years ago.

      For the last 2 weeks were the most hellish and gruesome ordeal that I went thru in uni life. There was these group projects which my friend and I had to 'tonn' night to finish it up. One of my project members was skiving off... knn... During project discussions, he doesn't talk a lot. I think I can use my brain and manually do a word count of the things he say and my brain is not that fantastic.  That comes to my topic: Commitment.  Different people have different levels of commitment they can put in. Throwing in some adverse conditions such as sleepiness, lectures the following day, and commitment levels will plummet.  Its something I discover the hard-way. Something I will endeavor.

      For this semester i took this module which requires us to go to this LT. Upon pulling out the table, i saw some 'table art' courtesy of some guy.. that wrote R.M.I.T in bold and below, it said   R -icky  M -artin  I -nstitute  T -echnology  Wa kaoz, after spending 2.5yrs here in my favourite Uni.. and there we have it. a abbreviation that absolutely skew the meaning of university education, where u can find abbreviation and some idiot will try to skew the meaning of it. What a mook!  autumn, 13 deg cel

       Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then Spin me around 'til I fell asleep Then up the stairs he would carry me And I knew for sure I was loved If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him I'd play a song that would never, ever end How I'd love, love, love To dance with my father again When I and my mother would disagree To get my way, I would run from her to him He'd make me laugh just to comfort me Then finally make me do just what my mama said Later that night when I was asleep He left a dollar under my sheet Never dreamed that he would be gone from me If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him I'd play a song that would never, ever end 'Cause I'd love, love, love To dance with my father again Sometimes I'd listen outside her door And I'd hear how my mother cried for him I pray for her even more than me I pray for her even more than me I know I'm praying for much too much But could you send back the only man she loved I know you don't do it usually But dear Lord she's dying To dance with my father again Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream     Dedicated to my uncle and his family, whom recently passed. - Sadly missed by all

       What  : Catch a movie (5 Guys and a Weirdo) Where : Crown Casino When  : 2000hrs    Inge  :" Ok ya.. so meet 2000hrs at ticketing booth."  And so 5 of us (Inge, Sisca, Jon, Alena and Me) brave the 11deg weather (+ drizzle) to watch Shrek II.  "... Sorry guys, Shrek II's sold out.."   And what a fine start we've got for a wonderful evening. All of us frantically trying to use the remaining brain cells we've got after tormented by 3 exams.  "Hairy Potter! and the prisoner of Alaska!", no i mean Azkaban. Basically, the group comprises of 3 charming ladies and 2 suave and cool guys.  "... Sure..Let's do it!"  As the show starts at 2100hrs, we have 3/4 of an hour before the show starts, so 3 charming ladies and 2 suave and cool guys went to feed themselves before the show commences.   Ok. Here's the weirdo  cum eerie cum spine chilling part..To protect the identity of the 'weird guy', we shall call him "Ah Tiang"  Scene 1, Act 1:   Inge       :" ya.. so u know ... that's why la " ("Ah Tiang" aproaches our table)   "Ah Tiang" : "........................."  Stan       : " urhhh. Sorry. u mind repeating that again?"  "Ah Tiang" : "mbubumbfroppo.... boufrybo angel mubmimop..."   Jon        : " errrr u have to speak up..i dun get what u mean?"  "Ah Tiang" : "Sorry, i mumbiob sick... Arch bmoomboiuy very friendly bmioirty.."   "Ah Tiang" : "AHem bimoibnmbi. Archangel has told me that u guys are very friendly people"  Jon        : " Ohhh..."  Inge       : " huhhhh?"  Sisca      : ".........."  Alena      : ".........."  Stan       : " huh.  ok... thanks a lot.."  "Ah Tiang" walks off. That has totally spooked us to the max, trying to figure what archangel is that guy mumbling about.   Scene 2, Act 1 (Inside the cinema)   Basically we were seated like this, then "Ah Tiang" came in!!!! Then he went to repeat the archangel mumbo jumbo to the person sitting at location (V) at Row E        88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888     __________________________________________________ A________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________| E_______ (X)(V)(V1) ________________________________|    |________________________________________________|   G_____________  (S)|(I)|(A)|(J)|(M) _________________|      |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     |________________________________________________|     Legend S - Sisca              I - Inge               A - Alena              J - Jon M - Me X - Weirdo (Ah Tiang) V - Victim V1- Victim's friend    It was definitely eerie. And so i came to conclusion.  1. He's too stressed by exams           - Coz now its the exam period, so maybe he's kinda stressed-out  2. Pay it Forward logic            - Contributed by Inge or Sisca... can't remember. where "Ah tiang" needs to tell     to a certain amount of pple to pass the benefit.  3. Kena Sabo-ed           - Which i think its highly unlikely.  4. Cult Leader           - Fingers away from dialing 000.  5. Trying to be corny           - luckily i am in a good mood, else i will *Beeesh* him and *Zoink!* and *KarPow* him.(Verbally) haha, caught u there, didn't I? Come on, the '79s are so cool and suave, how could we resort to such scheming tactics? Ok. at most,              i will just tobasco his non master eye. *Smirk*  Anyway the show was great.. GOod twist at the end to make the ending so flawless. A  8.5/10  for me. (-0.5 for drizzling, -1 for the weirdo)  That's it

      Had my 1st paper today. Its at 13.C.13. Basically, the exam was held in this very authentic Victorian hall. Its so Retro. SO retro, that i almost dance "Square Room" and with complimentary hand signs. Oh huh oh oh.. square roooom...." and then i will sing,   "Oh my love, it’s you and that I dream of   Oh my love, since that day   Somewhere in my heart I’m always   Dancing with you in the summer rain"  But after that i will get evicted, even before i can get my ass planted and whip out my student card. So i decided to ass myself down quietly.Paper wasn't that bad. Hope can score well. Went to eat dinner with Cynthia before heading back. Counted: 17 days to go before my academic life ends.  I do have to apologies for my bad contents, coz its exam season, so not much inspirations, coz i m mugging all the while. I promise more juicy contents after exams lah. Muahahuahuahua.  Ok. got to get backt to MSN.

      There seems to be something wrong about the alignment for the sidebar and the main panel for this template i am using. Tried using several browsers to view the blog   1. Mozilla Firefox  -Sweet!  2. Netscape 7.1  - Sweet!  3.I.E 6  - All Screwed up, haywired!garang gabok!Senggek!Apa?  I tried to edit the html both in IE, and in firefox and netscape, only IE poses the problem. Again i would like to highlight the _dominance_  of dear _M$_ in the browser industry. Watching Jerry Springer now, walau.Very happening...Woaaaah!GOing to resume studying later.  That's it.

      Hey!Its been 3 days since i last blogged. I was rather caught up with my exam revision. Basically i have 4 exams which happily falls on the 7th, 15th,16th and 24th of this month. So effectively, i have 21days, before my final academic battle ends. After that, i am going to party like hell, drink like hell, create a wreakage, here in Melbourne. But wait, my parents are coming on the 26/6/04 early hours. So, if u do a little bit of maths, i have 29hrs to party like hell, drink like hell. Pathetic? Well,i work try to work things out somehow.  In order to refrain myself from watching too much tv, i had done the following,  1.stick motivation poster on the tv screen  it works, coz i am too lazy to walk up and take down the motivation poster.UNless it's Jerry Springer show,Oprah,Queer Eye for the straight guy,Something about Miriam.  Recently there is this reality show i am rather plugged into, thats "Something about Miriam". Its about this girl, whom there are suitors going after her, but miriam isn't a girl by nature. Cool huh? i have been trying to analyse anything going on down there. But sadly...ain't see  anything..  Anyway, after exams, my parents are coming, so perhaps we are going to the snow mountains, to Perth, hopefully, i can get out of Melb,(by myself?heh) to somewhere.. Perhaps after 2.5years of academics, its time for me to take a hard-earned break. I need it. Please dun take it away from me. I implore.  Went to revision lecture today, nothing much gained, coz i haven started on that subject yet. Its about .NET technologies et al. Misssomeonebackinsghopeeverythingturnsoutwell.  That's it.

      Finally!  On 24th June 2004, marked the end of my student life. Whilst bading "Bai Bai" to my student life, there were memories to be validated. In my 2.5years in Melbourne, I have met many, many encounters. I know its impossible to recollect everything, but I will try to dig up from my faithful memory bank of mine.  Starting of a chapter has always been a bumpy ride and its the courage to flip the next page, to face the next challenge, is what makes life worthwhile. In the process of the paper chase, one faces both poles of utmost trepidation and happiness. All these vast ranges of emotional changes are encapsulated into a whole package called student life.   Friends are what makes studying not that stressful. Especially in overseas university education, friends fade in and out. Mutual effort to keep the fire burning will sustain the friendship going.  Now that my exams are over and awaiting my "Official Results", I sub-consciously realised that despite the closure of one chapter, I should be feeling elated, but i am not. Strange? Perhaps, i know i am going to leave this place i have grown to love, the friends that i have made, the ups and downs I had.  Maybe, its the 'student mode' i am in, i can't exactly recall how stressed i was during assignments/exam period. Amazingly, what hovers around in my mind, are the fun,memorable times i had in Melbourne. All the lunch appointments :), thinking of where to eat, the jacket piercing cold weather @ brighton beach, the early sunday camberwell market, the 'no-destination' drive.... equates =  fond memories that I will never forget. Memories that i will never forget, memories that i will bring along, memories that i will tell my kids about, memories to recollect when i am old. All stashed and reserved in a little corner of my mind permanently.    M emoir, that i had so many,  E vanescent, my memories will not  D eparture, i can't bear to, Bravery, i know i need to don Friendship, i lest forget   Stanley

      One night, i received an SMS. Its from my best-friend's little sister, Tracy. Hey, thanks for reviving that little incident. To prevent such memories from fading away, i shall type it out.  Its about one fine evening. We had our dinner at Chinatown. As usual, we will walk along Swanston st, to Flinders St. station, where we would wait for her Cranbourne/Pakenham/Sandringham/Frankston bound train before i walk home.  BF: Hey! want to have a game of Table tennis? Stan: Sure, orkay!  So, my best friend and I walk to my apt, becoz at the basement of my apt, we have a blue table tennis table.  I dunno what got over me, i guess it was "Kid Mode"  Stan:"Hey, why not u take the lift, and i dash up the stairs?" BF: "Bu yao siao la"  But i guess i was rather adamant and want to break the usual rountine. I lived on the 10th floor. Each floor is separated by 2 flight of stairs, having 8steps for 1 flight. U must be wondering how come i know the configuration so well.  Stan:" Ok la, but u have to to press lvl 1,2,3.. then we start together. Med: "...."  So i help her press lvl 1,2,3. And the Race began!  G, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9------------>10  Stan:" *pant**pant**pant**pant**pant**pant* " BF : ( med, can u fill in on this part? i cant remember coz i was panting)  All these as mentioned, i could have forgotten, if not for a spark that triggered it. Once again! Credit goes to my best friend and tracy whom were talking about it.  Stairs, basically i would climb it when the following situation occurs 1. Stressed 2. Can't solve a programming bug 3. Gym routine.  Besides that, i feel that stairs, although its a simple object in everyday life, is often overlooked. Its there when u want to use it. It helps u achieve what u want to do, while staying rooted faithfully.  Will Blog again.

      As what carrie bradshaw always starts off in SATC,  in my version of it, I have somewhat similar concept. I am sitting on the floor, fingers on lappie, listening to "Ai Yi Ge Ren Hao Nan - William So" and i typed (upon recent encounters)  - "........Classic case of wrong timing or should I just submit to my fate?"  In life, things don't just operate like clockwork.  In certain point in time, one would have to make a decision. Decision-making involves implication in later stages which is yet to be delineated. In this point in time in my life, i would say the year of 2004 is really full of suprises. Surprises i expected, surprises i least expected and surprises that aren't surprises.  To a certain extent, i do believe that Heaven is fair. What justifies me in saying that? Humans have short/long comings. So one can be good in something, but somehow at some other arena, it stand seconds.  After 2.5years overseas, besides the paper i've gotten, there are so many valuable lessons that i've learnt. Lessons which can't be learnt in lecs/tutes. That's lessons in life. There is no training doctrine for it. Everyone's encounter is different, thus different TSR. No one can never say "Hey. how come your life and my life is so similar one har?"  Crap!  When approaching a Y-junction, its inevitable that a decision has to be made. One can't possibly revert back to the original settings when he/she made the wrong decision. Life Archictecture doesn't work in that manner. You live the decision u've made and make the best out of it, build on the fact that u do not know what lies ahead.  Life may seem simple, but it would be worthwhile if u inject some challenges in it.. Hmmm this thought just came in.  Till date, this bloke has sent out 30+ job applications. Dejected? no. Dis-heartened? No. I shall hold on. 95% of the jobs requires the Vitamin E, which i am lacking. "..bla bla.. u r too highly qualified,but we are looking for pple with more working experience". If all jobs requires job experience,  THEN WHO THE #$%^&*#$% going to give Fresh Graduate  a chance????!!!   Singapore's getting too stagnant. It's time to jump-ship!  Today's sunday. going to wash 3051 later.  Hai... i miss my best friend in Melbourne.  Laterz, Unilodge on Flinders
