      Today was goooood.   mammaw picked me up from school early and we went and had lunch and i bought the stuff to fix up my costume.  my outfit looks great, it's a blue gown with criss-cross strings in the back and i like it. It's one of mom's old dresses that she wore to a Mardi gras ball. i had to line the zipper in the back with little safety pins and then string some yarn through the holes, and i;m not sure what I'll do about the halter part of it... Probably just tuck it in and pray, but I'm positive they didn't have halters in 1550, so i can't leave it like that.  as this whole monologue thing approaches I'm getting a little nervous. Not in a bad way, just the minimum amount of nervousness any normal human being has. I'll be glad when it's all said and done. But i do get to miss school all day. Except ((OF COURSE)) French, which is my last hour and morehead already told us we wouldn't have time to change clothes so I'll be in French and on the bus in this freaking poofy dress. jeez.  been talking to amelie. She's cool. She knows who metric is. i think she left me a comment yesterday.  ((w00t w00t))  i just dropped a crumb in my orange juice. That's funny.  i love orange juice.  I'm getting SO good at playing leads, you guys should hear me.

      Yesterday and today were pretty much the same as every other day this week with minor xceptions that i will now convey in full detail.  Shane finally blogged and he's in love and i'm truly happy for him because he's a really wonderful guy.  Today i decided that i will be happy. being depressed and morose is fun and all, but it's just not a big enough challenge. i think a blissfull facade will be a nice change of scenery. and like i told heather, i may be dead on the inside, but people don't bother to look there and happy people have more friends.   Perhaps that is everyone in this houses' problem... nobody strives for happines, they don't make attempts to amuse themselves. which only brings us back to  the laziness of america and yahta yahta . who cares.  I finally finished my powerpoint. it was a bitch, and now i have to find a goddamn renaissance costume. if i can't make do((due, dew, doo?)) with something from mom's closet, i'll have to call the costume folks super quick. god i am such a procrastinator!

      Ok i changed my mind. i can't do without blogging for more than a couple days or i start to explode.  I'll start with Saturday and work my way through this shitpile of a week. But then, do i EVER have a week that's not a shitpile?  Saturday was a blast. Me tiffany, Brandon, and Rick. We couldn't go bowling because all the lanes were taken so we went and saw cheaper by the dozen. It was a stupid movie, but the people i was with were a blast and we were wild.  so Monday was shitty. i STILL have finished the goddam motherfucking bitchwhore powerpoint project. It was a normally crappy day until mom picked me up from guitar lessons acting like a fucking idiot who dropped some bad acid. She swerved all over the road, honked at cars for no reason, would NOT quit calling Steven and yelling SONOFABITCH, and scared the shitt out of me. So after a lot of yelling and swerving, i grabbed the wheel and managed to get us home. She staggered into bed and when she woke up a few hours later she ran out of her room and said "DID SOMEONE GO GET CAITLIN?!". Well after some picking her brain we concluded that she was mad at Steven and her blood sugar was so low from taking too many diet pills that she doesn't even remember the entire afternoon. It was a really fucked up thing and she didn't even apologize until i squeezed it out of her.  so today i went into school and worked on my monologue some more and I'm still not done and Ms. morehead made me say my monologue and then didn't make anyone else say theirs. i hate her and i want to wring her scrawny wrinkly stupid neck.  I've pretty much decided that i hate everything.  so I've noticed that in the afternoons momma is obnoxious and stupid... Almost drunk acting... But she says she's not drinking...  you know, the only time I'm with my mother and she's not all fucked up is when she takes me to school in the mornings. That's before she's had a diet pill, a chance to drink, a meeting with Steven, or been to the tanning bed. It makes me sad.   I've decided I'm not going to capitalize my entries anymore((except for when the blogger spellcheck gets it)). It takes too long and it doesn't matter anyway.  so tonight she was being her usual idiot obnoxious self and she told me to go wash the dishes that won't fit in the dishwasher which really makes me mad because the ONLY-ONLY-ONLY-ONLY-ONLY job mammaw has is to wash the dishes that won't fit in the dishwasher and I'm so stressed most of the time it wouldn't have killed someone else to do it. So when i brushed it off and continued typing she came in here and clicked away my entire foot long email and closed all of AOL and it really makes me want to hit her hard in the face when she is so dumb and immature she can't even tell me to do the dishes without fucking up something in my life. But i DID do the bitchwhore dishes and i DID retype the email and she finally went to bed so i can be at peace. And YET STILL i am not at peace because as i was feistily washing dishes she said to me "if you kill yourself  I'll kill myself too and haunt you forever".... Ok... So now I'm not even safe to kill myself. What else is there to do when instead of tenderly dissuading me she THREATENS me. shitpissfuckshitpissfuckshitpissfuck  so concludes my shitpile week, which is yet another layer of my shitcake life, the icing on this shitcake being the fact that i am only 14 years old and already my spirit is broken. It's not dormant or depressed or temporarily out of service, it's shattered into tiny pieces that embed themselves into my skin and drive me mad. i hate this.

      I have decided I'm taking a break from blogging, a hiatus, if you will.   Try not to miss me too much...  Not because i don't want to, but because I'm literally drowning in everything and i don't have time to recollect my own thoughts.  I lead an life of inconvenience, as though existence itself is a hindrance... Precluding a higher and more important journey and skimming the top off the universe. i cannot sleep, i cannot awake, i find joy in nothing but the end of another day. a few more breathes, a few more words. Such a long time left for a spirit dead as mine.  Oh and here's that song you folks have been begging for.  dear system please don't free us without you we've no cause dear smiling communist we love fighting your wars  Well.... I got the first 4 lines but i can't think of anything else.  Don't you just love militant garage punk lyrics.   SuGgEsTiOnS?

      Alright alright I'm on the internet so i guess i should blog. i wouldn't want all 3 people who read this thing to start a riot.  Has anyone besides me noticed that the posting part of my site takes forever to load? i think it's that sound clip i put on that makes it so slow. So if you click me and all you see is two blue columns, then don't give up just yet. But then, if all you see is blue columns how would you be able to read this message? Oh well.  This morning we went to waffle house and had ((you guessed it)) waffles. It was quite tasty.  Because i will be bowling/spending the night/doing something fun tonight, they have piled on the chores which is why i have to cut this post short. Be back tomorrow for more adventures of Caitlin... The uh.... Blonde one.

      What a fabulous day.  On the way to school i told mom i didn't feel like going. So she said she'd come get me after she'd had coffee with Steven. About 11 she came and checked me out and we had mother/daughter bonding time.   First we went to nicki's((Mexican food.. w00t)), and we were just chatting about random stuff when mom noticed me looking at the dude in the booth behind. She turned and looked at him and we started joking about asking him to come sit with us. So, of course, mom aked him. Turns out he is a really nice guy. Ernie, married, 4 kids by two different wives, has great taste in music, knew some people from mom's highschool. Then he bought us lunch and mom's peacock feathers puffed out because "you know you've got the prettiest mom when strange men will buy her lunch".  Then we went and got waxed((thank heavens for well-groomed eyebrows)).  Then we went and saw cold mountain. It was supremely depressing and in my opinion, not that wonderful. Every five seconds something((animal or human)) would be mutilated and killed and they didn't hold back one bit on the nasty details. Then before i could even chill out was the scene where they sawed a cows head off, they were having big ol' totally naked crazy Nicole kidman sex.   Then we came home in a fabulous mood and as soon as we walked in mammaw was like "well Shannon, if you meant to hurt my feelings you did a good job, you knew you were going to the movies and you didn't invite me". And mom was like "bla bla bla" and i thought "oh crap, now i feel bad about having a mother/daughter day and not making it a mother/daughter/grandmother day. Does she really mess up my moods like that? i mean, really.  So now I'm back home, Devon is spending the night somewhere, and it's all good.  Has anyone besides me ever noticed that smell you have when you've been outside near the dirt? It's not a bad smell, it's really earthy and calming. And i only smell it when I've been near sandy dirt, and it's not too hot outside. Well anyways i smelled it when i came up from playing tennis the other day and thought it was nice.  Yaaawn i better get some rest, I got a big day tomorrow. I invited shane to come bowling with me and tiffany and Chris, I hope he shows.  OH by the way the song of the day is devoted to nikki my bloggie buddy, the whole -sex fiend- thing might not exactly describe you nikster, but you get the idea. ((but hey, you could be a sex fiend and I just don't know it!))

      I didn't blog yesterday, so in my head, yesterday didn't really exist. blogging is kind of my icing, the lid, the wrap-up. Without it, the day seems amiss, as though not publishing it makes it a void space.   Nothing exciting happened yesterday. i said my monologue again and did better than a couple other people again. Why do they get so nervous? I wouldn't consider myself someone born for the stage, but what is such a huge deal that some of the poor darlings can't even get past the first line? Eh.  The rest of the day is kind of a blur, I got a bad sinus headache in French, so I knocked back a couple sudophedrine((NOT an easy thing to do with nothing but spit)) and came home and slept. Then tiffany called and invited me bowling. Yah.  Today was basically the same as yesterday except that Emily and I decided Ms. Hughes is not the sweet, oblivious, reefer old lady she pretends to be, but rather a passive aggressive battle-ax who notices our slacking, talking, skipping, copying, but rather than stopping us she just sabotages our grade. I don't exactly know how me came to this conclusion, but it sounds pretty good don't you think?  We have a new teacher in French. Well she's not really a new teacher, she's learning how to teach and we are her guinea pigs. The real teacher sits in the back of class and kind of helps out. But i like the new lady, her methods are better and she got rid of that stupid notebook check at the end of the nine weeks.  Mom won't be home tonight. I really don't mind though, she's been driving me nuts the last couple nights. She says she hasn't been drinking, but she acts like an idiot.   Can't wait to go bowling this weekend, I had a blast last time.   OK, so they make this stuff now called -diet coke with lime- and it is the BEST diet coke I have ever had. It's like... YEAH! Mammaw went to the "top o' the hill"((gas station)) to get cigs and she's gonna bring me one!!! YAY  I'm trying out this band called Flogging Molly, it's weird. They are like punk/rock/Irish folk singers. I've gotta put some of this shitt up here:  So, did you like that?  Everybody needs to watch American Idol. I wasn't into it the last two seasons, but I've been watching the auditions and they are hilarious! I mean, do these people honestly thing they can sing? Or are they just there to be on tv? ch-yeah.  Let me say this: someone told me they loved me today and it made me absolutely threeled. I love everyone who reads this blog, and if you don't read it, I still love you!!! ((except you suck))  Might Post Later.

      I walked into class this morning thinking we had nothing to do, but of course, we were supposed to have memorized our monologues and present them in front of the class. So i panicked, told morehead i wasn't ready, she said i could just take a 0, and i said fuck that. It took me about 5 minutes of intense studying and a lot of will power, but i DID deliver and i DID do better than some of the other people who had spent time actually learning the shitt. i only made a few mistakes, but she took off 7 points. I'm assuming most of them were "you might think you're good, but i still hold the red pen and i don't like it when little kiddies spend minimal time studying and still pull it off" points.   I tried   urlLink ASTRAL PROJECTION  last night. i got to the vibration stage had to quit because what came along and decided to scare the shit out of me? a ghost. a cute ghost that laced it's fingers with mine, grabbed at them, and left as soon as i asked them to. i generally try to keep all contact with ghosts/spirits to a minimum((except for maevyn, a very special cat that died)), but i guess since i was so... Open? At the time, that it was like a big neon sign for them. i suppose i am only afraid and keep them at bay because i would hate to run into an angry one((poltergeist)), and be freaked out for the rest of my life.  I was listening to some white stripes in the car with mom the other day and she asked me if i had ever looked up the meaning to any of the lyrics, i told her it was for the individual to interpret. It got me to thinking about how some people condemn things they don't understand. i thought, if you cut a Picasso into tiny pieces and organized all the pieces by color, you still wouldn't understand it any better, you'd only be left with a whole bunch of confetti, with which you could throw a party for dumb people. So think about that one, folks, perhaps the next time you find something you don't understand, look at the feeling, the mood, and never take anything at face value((unless it's money, and even then, it could be counterfeit money, or inflation could be moving so rapidly in the same instant you looked at it, the value would change)).  I was talking to jean today and she reminded me of a story. i call this story "Leigh Anne Sandwitch on Wheelchair Bread". in 8th grade i went to new Orleans on a class trip. We had an entire day to visit the French quarter. i was in a group with this extremely mean and evil girl named Leigh Anne. Nobody liked her, and it wasn't because children are cruel. She had broken her leg a few weeks before the trip and against everyone's advice, had still decided to go. Well since being in the French quarter required a lot of walking, she had been given a wheel chair. Everyone had tried to help her getting over bumps/cracks((the chaperone said we had to)), but she refused help from anyone. Because she had no guide, she was going wildly down the streets, yelling at us to leave her alone. Well she bounced along without any major problems((except giving us something to snigger about)), until we came to a large curb with a grate at the bottom, of course, we offered to help her, but she still refused. Well she flew over the curb, part way down the street, and into a big pothole in the middle of the road. The wheel chair and Leigh Anne toppled over, and the entire chair collapsed on that evil thing. Well she was fine afterwards, in fact i think the other people in the group suffered more from laughing so hard we couldn't breathe. It was a perfect comical moment.  Alright then.. Dinner is almost ready. I'm back on my diet today. I've gotten unusually fat over the last week or so and I'm sick of it.  I'm also sick of mom's drunk/sad/shitty/bad mood, which carried over from last night.

      Okay  I'm ready to blog for today.   Today I woke up in wonderful mood so I said good morning to everyone on my buddylist.   Then I went to guitar and he gave me some lead stuff to play with, which I picked up rather easily, and I think I will enjoy learning. It's very cool and professional sounding.   I spent a good part of my day writing an email to heather, my new, Canadian/Scottish, lovely friend. ((her blog is stinkstankstunk)). Should I post our emails up here? They are pretty interesting. I'll have to ask her if she minds.  Mom was totally crocked when she came in from pappaw's house tonight. mammaw wondered why she was so upset and she didn't want to tell her, but mammaw thought it had something to do with pappaw's health so she kept pestering and my mom kept yelling to the top of her freaking lungs "close the goddam door!" and mammaw kept saying "if you say GD one more time, I'll stand here all night" so they continued in this pattern for a while, but eventually gave up. I'm sick of my mom's bullshit. Being crocked all the time and then taking it out on us. fcuk a dcuk.  I've been so resilient lately, numbing myself to everything because it seems so bad I don't think I'll be able to keep it together... It all seems like a bad dream now. But then, this whole "happy" thing, doesn't feel right, like maybe there is something I should be upset about, I just don't remember what it is.  I had a dream last night where I went to a bank and saw nikki working there. i told her about it today and she said she doesn't work at a bank, but there is one next door. See! I'm telling you! i can atrally project, just very poorly. i looked it up today, and apparently falling halfway asleep and then doing whatever i want to in my head is not the proper way of going about it. So tonight I've got a little experiment to do as far as that goes.  I also read up about wiccans, extremely interesting. Would i make a good wicca? i bet i would. i believe in all the stuff I've found on the internet so far, channeling, atral projection, being in touch with nature, it's good stuff.  But at this point, the majority of my beliefs change as often as my underwear. ((and i change underwear as much as everyone else does))  Ok I'm pooped out and i still have a research paper to correct and reprint. i think I'll turn it in late, either that or do it in the morning.

      I'm going to read the Artemis Foul series again. If you haven't read them, you are seriously missing out. It's about a genius who opens up some kind of portal to the fairy world and steals all their money so he can use it to find his father who was taken by the Russian mob.  When I finish those, I'm going to read Long Hot Summoning... Ok I just saw everyone with their minds in the gutter perk up. The only thing long and hot in the book is the summer weather, which, if you are in the book and are standing in the parallel universe featured there, is so hot the tar is melting.   Found yet another kick ass blog((as nikki would say)), check stinkstankstunk.   Mom was drinking, which really gets on my nerves because I was trying to practice and she kept screaming broken Eagles' lyrics at the top of her lungs. But she's asleep now, and I'm glad.  I was thinking about how people are often telling me they are boring and everyday. I made me realize that if you think about it, everyone is different in some way, and that even if you have to go into molecular detail, nothing is the same. Making words like average, everyday, and normal, positively void. That was your dose of caitlin-sprinkled philosophy for the month.   You know, I used to write infinitely long posts of everything, even dumb stuff that I knew nobody would care to read, but I've noticed my blogging has become more scarce and I don't like it one bit. I guess it's because when I read someone else's blog, if they have a particularly long paragraph, I will skim over it or skip it completely. But as long as I maintain blogging at least once a day, I'm happy. Because I cannot stand it when people don't post for days at a time and I visit their site as part of my normal routine and am greeted by the same freaking thing. Over and over and over.  Ok it's almost 10, I think I'm done now.  You know what? I'm going to write a song tonight and post it on here in the morning. It will be a good song.

      Whew.  Went to pappaw's for lunch today, it was a total meatfest and I loved it. He is for sure the best griller/smoker/boiler I know. Plus he and aunt carol ((his sister))((they live together)) and just plain old nice people with nothing but nice things to say. They remind me of Matthew and marilla cuthbert from Anne Of Green Gables.  Momma is in a super foul mood, luckily she's decided to take all of her premenstrual frustrations out on Devon, who has also been in a shitty mood all day.   Err I don't think I have anything else to talk about except to say that the distillers are a better band than I thought and velvet underground really sucks and violent femmes are nifty.  You know violent femmes, they sing that song that is like "why can't I get just one kiss, why can't I get just one screw..."  I tried to get a chatterbox and it was all screwed up. I'm gonna go try to find another one. ((yeah, I know, I have obsessive compulsive blog-renovating disorder))

      Alrighty then!  I finally finished nitpicking this new template down to the smallest detail and I'm quite pleased with it.  I also found a new blog and I really like it. Check out scott on the links. I went and read all of his archives, and he says some of the funniest things! Good Night all.  ((OK maybe not good night, maybe I'm going to watch TV until the wee hours of the morning, whatev))

      Just got back from seeing BIG FISH with Ewan McGregor. Now it gets on my nerves when people rant and rave about a book/movie/game in their blog so I'll just leave it at this: it was the best movie, it far surpasses every show I've seen in the last year or so, and it belongs in the top 5 greatest pictures ever.  On our way home from the movie, I made mom stop at B&N and I picked up a copy of BIG FISH, the book. I'm going to let mom read it first but I can't wait!   my favorite movies? Well let's see: Forrest Gump, all Jim Careys comedies((excluding Bruce Almighty, which was a major boo-boo, with a religious undertone no less)), the Franco Zeffirelli version of Romeo and Juliet((baz lurman's disgusting parody of the play was a trainwreck and I think it's insulting and Shakespeare rolled over in his grave when he heard about it)), Ever After, Moulin Rouge, The Matrix trilogy, The Last Unicorn((75% good story, 25% nostalgic quality)), The Southpark Movie, and i'm sure I'm forgetting some. What are your favorite movies? Leave me a comment.   my least favorite movies: gigli, glitter, Halloween: resurrection, the spice girls movie, any movie EVER shown on lifetime, darkness falls, Mona Lisa smile, I think I could go on forever but right now I'm hungry... I may have already said this but I hate popcorn and I refuse to pay that much for candy so when we get out of a movie everyone except me is stuffed. That's it for now.

      Sorry about not posting until now, but I had this really long one going and this mutherfukker AOL kicked me off.   So yesterday was nice until I got home and online.   Had a sub in morehead((w00t)), have a 106% in geometry, grew some fantastic bacteria in our agars even if Tyler squished part of it, had the greatest time in 5th hour taking pictures with Bess, had a sub in French, and came home and watched general hospital((majorly exciting stuff going on)), then made up for lost sleep last night with a 10 hour marathon((I actually woke up at 5am and was like "get up get up!" and then I was like, "screw you! Sleep sleep sleep!"  Bess is a foreign exchange student from Hong-Kong and she's fun. She brought her digital camera to school and took pictures with everybody.   So yay yippee ya until I came home and made a smartass comment on nicks blog so he IM'ed me and said "your ego annoys me to no end" so I hung my mouth open for a while and felt really crappy and he said he was only telling the truth and I was majorly upset. But then I asked my grandmother, who always tells the ugly truth, if she thought I had a big ego and she said nope. So I decided nick was waaaay off base and even though he is a great guy I won't be talking to him anymore. I'm not sure if it's because I am angry at him or if I would continue talking to him and thinking "I'm driving him nuts with all my egotistical and sarcastic dribble"  Either way I don't care anymore.  Hanging out with Jean, Jonathan, Sarah, Bess, and all those other people, is definitely the highlight of my school day. Yesterday we couldn't play volleyball because the ROTC kids were using it to drill, so we sat on the bleachers and laughed ourselves silly with... Everything. a man swatted at a moth and it hit the floor and started flopping around, I immediately jumped up and said "oh no he hurt it! I need to put it out of it's misery!" and jean said "you're going to kill it!??!!?!" "it's MISERABLE!!" I said "how would you like it if some giant hand came around and swatted you and left you to flop around in agony? Would you want them to leave you there or stomp on you so you could die quicker?" she started snickering and said "cause of death: fatal swatting to the torso by mysterious giant hand" we laughed and laughed. And by that the time I had turned back to the moth, it had flown away.

      Today was pretty boring...  morehead panned my research report that I literally wept over. But I'm so sick of that bullshitt I'm not even going to elaborate.  grr I have a bio test tomorrow... This week we've been growing bacteria in agars, which was a real kick seeing what grew more crap, the swab from the doorknob or the on from the inside of a desk.   my head is totally empty, actually... blogger seems not to be working so I didn't get to read much, maybe I should try the recently updated list, but they always turn out to be in another language.  sorry for this pitiful post, but I'm tapped.

      I think maybe this whole fiasco is beginning to come to a close.   Mom picked me up from school early and we had taco bell((wood!)) but in exchange for skipping French class I had to help her spread mulch on the flower beds. Aside from pulling something in my shoulder, that didn't bother me one bit. Probably because I got to hit giant bags of wood chips with a sharp shovel until they burst open((mom offered to draw a picture of morehead on the bag for me. hehe)), and then throw it all over like confetti... a really great way to relieve tension if you ask me. Then I made some iced tea that is so strong you can't see through to the other side of the glass, just the way I like it.  So today wasn't so bad, and it's  a good thing .  Right this very second I think I would give my left nut for a rice crispy treat, too bad for me I don't have any nuts to be giving away. I love those little things! They are by far the best dessert not to mention lower in fat than most sweet treats. They're so chewy and sweet and wonderful! ---so I have a thing for rice crispies, back off bucko!  I am quite cheery but also quite tense. I think I will go take a shower.  Then I'll watch general hospital.  Then I'll turn my amplifier up to 99 and make  Siamese-cat-in-heat/happy-hump-back-whale noises, that always seems to relax me... For some reason. ((that was a pretty bad joke))  ((wAaAaAaAh))((mo0o0o0o0om))((twangety twang))

      Tuesday morning mom talked to morehead on the phone, she told her that my monologue was just fine and that it wasn't lewd or crude and that I felt like she was over-criticizing everything and everyone. Then morehead said that my hour was her weakest class and we had people barely passing and mom suggested that maybe since I was in her weakest class she was being overly critical with me since I was in her bad class((but I have a B)). And my mom said she was like "I can't believe it, but you're exactly right" and she told my mom she would lighten up and accept my monologue with only minor changes.   And then she came back into the room and went into a spew about how she never meant to be mean or rude or a bad teacher but that she only wanted to help us make our work better and bla bla bla she kept yammering I kept saying 'ok, ok' when out of nowhere she starts crying! So she reiterated what she had said, grabbed a tissue, and that was that. But really!!! I finally had one on her, I finally had beat her at her own game, and she turns on the waterworks! Jesus... I guess she's just good at kind of thing, when all else fails, make them feel sorry for you, it's sure to make them give in.  So even though I technically won, the victory wasn't as sweet as it would have been if she hadn't patronized the hell out of me and then started sobbing!  Today I said something silly to jean today and then walked away smiling and this girl I don't know said "she thinks she's cute, doesn't she?" and then started mocking me. For some reason, I can't quit thinking about it. I guess because I hate when people don't like me. I hate it more than anything and in most cases I will go to great lengths to make sure everyone loves me. And what right does she have to be saying things about me? She doesn't even know my name. To me it's amazing that there are people out there who are so conceded that they can insult someone in hearing range without ever having spoken a word to them. I'm not really sure if she meant for me to hear her, but it's not like she whispered or anything, and I was just behind a different set of shelves in the locker room. I wonder if jean shook her head yes when that girl said that.   I've always wondered what people say about me when I'm not around. Hopefully that chick is just a bitch((and not even a cute, skinny bitch like you'd think, a fat frizzy one)) and most people really think I'm "nice". Because to me, I am nice... I never say bad things about people((outside of my blog and my internet friends)) because I know eventually those bad things will get to their ears and will come back to bite me in the ass. And even when I do, it's always because they had in some way hurt me, not because I think they think they're cute.  That stupid girl has got me all upset. Maybe she was having a rough day and just needed to pop off. The only person I can think of who doesn't like me is this girl named %^^%&. I don't know why, I don't know what I did, but she always looks at me funny and when she does speak to me, it's always critical and sour. Then the other day I asked to use the phone she and a friend ran up behind and said "so do we!" so the teacher gave us the keys to her office and $%^%$ ran ahead of me and shut the door to the office and her friend stayed on the phone for 7 minutes or so and she saw me getting impatient and turned and smiled her evil "hahaha I was a rude pig and it's getting on her nerves" smile. After 10 minutes I left and they emerged seconds after me. I hate people like that... If you have a problem, you should tell me. Don't torture, ignore, sneer at or talk bad about me to other people. What is it with degenerates like that? I just can't find the sense in it.   I am more ready for this week to be over than any other week I can think of. morehead assigned the monologue, research paper, and powerpoint project all within days of each other and it's wearing me down to the nub. Like I've said before, I won't be able to put this highschool education to good use if I'm in the nuthouse, which is where I'm headed if things don't cool down and get back to the normal pattern.... Or possibly even get back to a better pattern?   Mom wants to send us to mompat's((baaad grandmother)) because she says "when we're here, she can't have fun". Great, just... Great. You know I had a real record going for avoiding her, I haven't seen the woman since last summer. How I managed to get out of Christmas, I don't know myself. But it works for me.

      Here at school, during lunch, hiding in the lab with Emily.  You'll have to excuse the confumbled and unusually insane post from last night. I WAS going crazy. My grandmother wouldn't leave me alone and I was already upset from all this morehead stuff going on and mom leaving and being gone all night. But she kept on pushing me and messing with me and I just couldn't stand it anymore. So I started crying and sobbed quietly through the writing of my whole research paper.   I think I will call mom and make her come get me before I have to go to French. I really dread going to that class every single day. When I wake up in the morning, I think "Shitt, in 7 hours and 30 mintues i have to go to French". The teacher is nuts, the method is nuts, and our class is so ornery and dumb it seems like we learn the same thing every day. Plus the teacher ((Madame Harris)) is really loud and freaky.   I hate iMacs, they are so ((and I never use this word with a negative connotation)) gay...  Bell just rang, must be leaving to go play volleyball.

      I'm.....  is this what it's like to lose your mind? Why is everyone trying to upset me? Why do I need to let tears fall on this keyboard? Why isn't momma here defending me? Why does my grandmother say such awful things? Why did she have to say them today? Why can't I just be let alone? Why do I need this?  they don't have to understand me. They don't have to coddle me. All they have to do is stay civil. All they have to do is care enough that I don't hurt too much, and I'm hurting too much right now.  I've never felt like this before. So angry and sad and insane. Like I can't even control my own thoughts. Like I don't even think being dead could make me feel better. Is that possible? To be sad to a point above suicide?   I have to write this research report. I have to.  why does she hate it when I blog? I told her it's therapy, she said that was a crock of shitt. I told her it wasn't a good day to be making such snide comments like she'd been doing since I got home. She didn't stop.   I can't do anything else.

      Well it's 9:45 now, I'm substantially more calm than I was earlier today. I think it's the -China Hot- that I ate, yeah it's true, I finally got to try some -China Hot- and I loved it. Had guitar lessons today, he gave me Hotel California-The Eagles((DUH)), so I could practice going from bar chords to normal chords. It's fun to play though, nice sound.  Mom completely agrees with me on the whole monologue thing and she's going to put on her bitchified outfit and go scream at morehead tomorrow morning. I can't wait.  Ok you've got to try this, I rarely find something that is so entertaining but this make a snowflake thingy is the best!  urlLink Make-A-Flake Here!

      fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck  So here goes my day. I woke up from my hours of precious sleep, a little groggy, but glad that I got to go to school and present my monologue that I am so proud of and that I agonized over from noon until midnight last night and countless hours in between. So I popped a caffeine pill and was on my way.  I got to school feeling quite chipper and handed in my assignment to the teacher. towards the end of class she began to read our monologues and when she got to mine she said to me from across the room "caitlin, this is not going to work." I blacked out a couple seconds, I couldn't fathom how something I had put so much effort into, something I had let get to me so much I was unstable, could be wrong. "I don't think this subject matter is appropriate for middle school children to hear." my eyes fuzzed over, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak, I felt the blood rushing to my head making me dizzy, tears welled up but I managed to choke them back, it was as if she had told me I was being put on death row with no hope of acquittal, that everyone I cared about will be tortured to death because I was too busy writing a bad monologue to care about them. I was speechless, devastated, unmitigably enraged, to a point that I lost touch with everything. I stumbled from the classroom, ignoring the teachers spouting, I was a puddle. I found my way to geometry, ignoring people around me, and I don't really remember what happened that whole hour. Even retelling it now, I'm pulsating with anger and despair.  MY MONOLOGUE FOR CATHERINE DE'MEDICI  Good morrow my lords and ladies, how dost thou be on this most gloomy of days? I beg thee forgive my foul disposition for I am quite distressed. My title is Catherine, Queen of France, my surname being DeÂMedici. Might you know of them? 'twasas announced this morn that the King has entrusted Diane with the crown jewels of France! How dare he do such a thing as that! And she, Diane de Poitiers, Duchesse de Valentinois, and of nothing! Prancing about the palace like the harlot that she is, living in the Chateau at Chenonceaux, which I, the queen, had expressly desired. As has been said, a mistress is one thing, but such blatancies!  She is a clever thing, and political astuteness I must give her, yet must she be so involved in HenryÂs affairs? Writing official documents and influencing all of his decisions as if she is of any high stature. ÂSigned, His Majesty, King Henry II of France and his wenchÂ I can only imagine! But alas, it is my duty as queen to keep an even temperament in times as these. I do love my Henry, and every courtesy passed between myself and Diane I permit for his entertainment. And still, how can I cast blame on him? She, being so thin and fair, and I, lacking such loveliness and wit.  It is that very wit that shall be my end if I do not tread lightly. I know of her scheming, of her devious plot to goad Henry into divorcing me because I have not bore him any childrenÂas of yet. I will produce an heir when the all is right, I am sure of it. IÂm Biding.biding my time. But perhaps the king is at fault? Perhaps his love for Diane preclude his desires to produce a royal heir with the queen? What of that?  The crown jewels of France! The royal mistress! PreposteroIs!  I can understand how if I had written this out of the blue, it may be a tad racy for middleschool children, but this is HISTORICAL FACT AND IF THEY CAN SHOW VIDEOS OF PEOPLE BEING TORTURED DURING THE HOLOCAUST, I THINK I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DISCUSS A FEW VERY VAGUE DETAILS OF AN AFFAIR THAT REALLY HAPPENED AND IF THE IDIOT TEACHER DIDN'T WANT US TO TALK ABOUT THAT KIND OF THING THEN SHE SHOULDN'T PUT THAT KIND OF PERSON ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE WE COULD DO BUT IF SHE DID THAT THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYONE ON THE LIST BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS DONE THAT KIND OF THING.  ok I'm done.

      Are these not the cutest lyrics. I wish I had a boy who wanted to warm my mother's heart.  I want to be the boy to warm your mother's heart  I'm so scared to take you away  I tried to win her over right from the start  But something always got in the way  We've been sitting in your backyard for hours  But she won't even come out and say hi  While my mother baked a little cake for you  And even dreaded when you said goodbye   What kind of cartwheels do I have to pull?  What kind of joke should I lay on her now?  I'm inclined to go finish high school  Just to make her notice that I'm around   Well nothing I come up with seems to work  It feels like everything I say is a lie  And never have I felt like such a jerk  I'm afraid to even open my eyes  Because I really don't want her to judge me  I want her to really know who I am  And the, and only then will she love me  Well at least that was the plan   If ever a boy needed a holiday  If ever a girl needed someone to hold  I just hope I don't act the same way  By the time that I get that old   I never said I was the heir to a fortune  I never claimed to have any looks  But these kind of things must be important  Because somebody ripped out my page  In your telephone book   I want to warm her heart   -The White Stripes

      I'm going to quote  urlLink [[No Milk Please]]  because I think this little bit of pondering he did is really... Good:  "The United States has the highest number of bloggers in the world. If terrorists wanted to wipe out America, they just need to bring Blogger down for a week and watch the violence and suicide increase as people find no vent for their Seinfeldian observations. Right-wing extremists, with no outlet for their fiery misspelled rhetoric will declare war on other nations, resulting in nuclear holocaust. A blogless coup.   Blogger has been going down more often of late. When it is down, I find myself worrying about how soon it will be back up. I feel impatient, helpless. The words are running and I want to catch them before they turn around the block and disappear. Without an outlet, how many people revert to talking to themselves? Without blogging do we find ourselves back in that place of loneliness?"   I think he just epitomized and transcribed my feelings exactly from this weekend without blogger. He's the coolest.

      Back from Kelsey's. We ate, watched movies, ate, ate, watched movies, ate, went bowling, ate, ate, and then she brought us back to Shreveport. When she was around me before, she never seemed to eat much and I wondered why she was so overweight, but this weekend at her apartment I learned why. We had three huge meals on Saturday and from the sounds of it, that's what she always does.  Needless to say I won't be doing much but guzzling the water/diet coke and putting a little more oomph in my volleyball playing this week. I checked the scales and was absolutely shocked! How could I have gained three pounds in two nights and a day!? Kelsey is one of those people who is freakishly nice, but you can tell that everything she does is done with the purest of good intentions. It's not often you find someone like that, and this is just the bastardofwesterncivilization talking, but I think her niceness makes her seem lacking in depth... Or maybe she's just good at hiding her feelings? Or maybe her Mormon farmer upbringing has truly produced a person of that nature. Who knows...  This week was tough. School is killing me, my mom is still on shaky ground((I think?!?)), and for some reason I am in one of those -I need to stick my lip out as far as it will go and pout until I'm blue in the face- kind of moods, but as of late I don't have time to feel anything, I only have time for homework, laundry, chores, and sneaking in bits of blogging. My monologue is due tomorrow, and I haven't typed one word of it. I have found wonderful ways of avoiding writing it like cleaning out the desk, cleaning the keyboard, burning a couple of CD's, looking for the system of a down CD I lost last summer, cleaning out my wardrobe and making a pile to give to goodwill, and eating the middle of a leftover cinnamon roll. I hate Ms. Morehead((I like to call her Ms. moredead)) and I hate her retarded off the wall assignments that aren't doing anything but stressing me out and making me insane. And HOW am I going to put my education to good use and succeed in life if I am insane?!?!? Did she ever think of THAT?  You know, this is what I was thinking of on Friday, I call it the typical highschool trainwreck. I can't stand up straight for my heavy backpack, short breaks have got my digestion screwed((it's true, on Friday I scarfed a lunch so fast I thought I would puke, I had to eat quick so I could go to the library and work on research since the teacher wouldn't let me go do it in HER class)), the bus gives me a headache, and I've got hours of homework to do every night and on weekends.   I don't think it's ok to put so much stress on a teenager, we're still trying to develop ideals like "life is worth living even if it sucks and I shouldn't kill myself" and "I shouldn't do drugs to escape from my own existence even if it is my existence that is so putrid and horrific". And of course there is that whole "these are the best years of your lives" thing when in fact, the best years of our lives are the ones we can't remember living and that stupid mantra is total bullshitt and our lives will only get exponentially worse by the day until we get so fed up that we just die.  I have spread the joy of blogging to yet another one of my friends. I think she's having trouble figuring out blogger though. Check tiffany's blog on the links in a couple days when she's got it set up nicely.  This weekend when I didn't have internet I was physically ailing for blogger. It's like some kind of drug, blogging, kind of scary. So I wrote down everything I was feeling like in a notebook and I'm going to copy it in here:  Post for Friday, January 9:  Today I saw a shirt that said "ROCK IS DEAD" and underneath that in small letters it said "Long Live Paper and Scissors!" I thought it was hilarious.  In world history we watched a show about the ancient Mayans ((movie day! haha Emily)), what amazing people they were. Today their lunar charts are only off by 33 seconds and they knew things about astrological happenings from 2000 years before. They predict that the end of the world will be December 23, 2012. Wouldn't that be interesting if they were right and the world as we know it was over in 8 years? But I guess it wouldn't matter if it were interesting or not since we'd be kind of... Oblivion.   Mom's been reading my blog and I really wish she wouldn't, hopefully this post will get the message across to her to "STOP READING MY BLOG, THERE IS A REASON I CHANGE THE ADDRESS SO MUCH YOU NOSY LICHEN!" is lichen to strong of a word to use against my mother, oh well, she's called her mother worse.  The Aristocats are coming to the Marjorie Lyons playhouse here in Shreveport!!! That is one of the best shows ever! Plus my friend destin got the part of Thomas o' Malley, the alley cat. I only hope I can find someone to go with me.       Well that's it for the Friday post. I left out a bunch of whining crap, I'm too lazy to type it in and it wasn't important anyway.   Post again before I get kicked off tonight.

      Well this is kind of weird, my mom just told me that until Monday when she sees the boyfriend she "broke up with" she won't be my mother. Kind of sad, huh? She said she would lay in bed and be depressed and that she would appreciate as much time away from me as possible. For a second there I couldn't even move, it was like a big slap in the face from someone you thought wasn't capable of such things. So I buried all the rocks in her zen garden.  You know, the tiny dish of sparkly sand that has pebbles and a little rake to go with it.  The stupid stupid player thingy I put on here is acting up ((already?!))   Bleh, in fact since dinner won't be ready until 7:30 and I'm starving to death, double bleh. It's time to watch wheel of fortune, I am THE BEST player that show has never seen. Maybe it's the whole -SmartGirl- thing, but I can get those puzzles in a heartbeat. of course then i just have to sit there and wait for the idiots on tv to get the answer((QUIT BUYING ALL THOSE VOWELS GODDAMIT! YOU'RE WASTING MONEY! THE ANSWER IS "A VERY SAD CLOWN IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS!"))

      A long time ago I posted a song on here called "Senior Don Gato", well I thought I had all the words, but turns out it's got lots of lines and it's hilarious!  O Senor Don Gato was a cat. On a high red roof Don Gato sat. He was there to read a letter, - (meow, meow, meow) where the reading light was better, - (meow, meow, meow) 'Twas a love-note for Don Gato!  "I adore you," wrote the ladycat, who was fluffy white, and nice and fat. There was not a sweeter kitty, - (meow, meow, meow) in the country or the city - (meow, meow, meow) and she said she'd wed Don Gato!  O Senor Don Gato jumped with glee! He fell off the roof and broke his knee, broke his ribs and all his whiskers, - (meow, meow, meow) and his little solar plexus - (meow, meow, meow) "Ay Caramba!!" cried Don Gato.   All the doctors they came on the run, just to see if something could be done. And they held a consultation, - (meow, meow, meow) about how to save their patient, - (meow, meow, meow) how to save Senor Don Gato.  But in spite of everything they tried, poor Senor Don Gato up and died. No, it wasn't very merry, - (meow, meow, meow) going to the cemetary, - (meow, meow, meow) for the ending of Don Gato.  But as the the funeral passed the market square, such a smell of fish was in the air, though the burial was slated, - (meow, meow, meow) he became reanimated, - (meow, meow, meow) he came back to life, Don Gato!

      mood: serene noise: the whispered shuffling of the Caddo Magnet library.  So do we like the song of the day thing or is it aggravating?  I don't know why I'm blogging since at this point of the day I am half asleep and won't awaken fully until I go to tennis class to play target practice I mean volleyball... That weird guy who looks like shane is always lurking around the gym, or maybe he's just transferred to tennis and I don't know it?  Woke up with a nirvana song in my head and decided to dress grunge today, which I pulled off rather well... My mom told me I look like a homeless person, doesn't she know that's the magnet style ?  What is this obsession with china hot? It's this tiny Chinese food place on a corner in a crappy part of town((but Shreveport is ONE BIG crappy part of town so I guess that was a little null)) every single day someone mentions it to me and I tell them I haven't eaten there and they explode. It's weird...  Won't torture you with dumb rambles about Chinese food anymore. ::torture torture:: ::poke poke:: ::laugh::

      I typed caitlin.blogspot.com into the browser and I found the most depressing blog ever written by a bulimic girl. All the entries are old and the poor blog's been abandonded but you should read the stuff that's there anyway, it's creepy and it makes me wonder what happened to her.  I saw you standing in the corner On the edge of a buring light I saw you standing in the corner Come to me again in the cold cold night  In the cold cold night  You make me feel a little older Like a full grown women might. But when you gonna grow colder  Come to me again in the cold cold night In the cold cold night  I hear you walkinÂ by my front door I hear the creakinÂ of the kitchen floor I donÂt care what other people say IÂm gonna love you anyway  Come to me again in the cold cold night In the cold cold night  I canÂt stand it any longer I need the fuel to make my fire bight So donÂt fight it any longer  Come to me again in the cold cold night In the cold cold night  And I know that you feel it too When my skin turns into glue You will know that itÂs warm inside And youÂll come run to me  In the cold cold night In the cold cold night In the cold cold night In the cold cold night

      Back again, only fatter. Mom cooked... Which is a bittersweet occasion for me because she makes such a mess and I have to clean it up.  I was thinking about a friend of mine who I could totally date. I won't say any names since this blog is semi-circulated around school, but I will blabber. He's a junior, he's in gateway((the gifted program at magnet)) like me, he's absolutely hysterical and fun to be around, and he's got that kind of -I look American but I've got good Scottish/English/something roots and that makes me good for staring at and wondering whether he wants a chick or a lass- thing going on. I see him every day and we talk a little bit, but I don't know if our joking around/getting into sticky situations could be considered flirting.  Have I yammered enough about people who could care less? I have a tendency to do that.  Going to see a movie with em this weekend. Hopefully if I post it up here I'll remember to call her or something. I think  I'll make a deal with myself to do something every weekend besides sit around here, it gets boring. But you know something really sad? I don't try extra hard to go out because I know when I get home I'll pay for it by having extra chores. I think it's kind of sick and sad that mammaw feels like she should cancel out my happiness with housework, but everything I go somewhere and come home it's like "OK YOU'VE BEEN OUT FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS BEING JOYFUL, IT'S TIME YOU DID SOMETHING AROUND HERE" and it's especially bad if we go out of town! What a pitiful thought... I don't get out much because my grandmother give me extra chores and yell if I look too happy about it. Mom says she is miserable so everyone else has to be miserable with her, and I think it's the sad truth.  I chose Katherine de Medici for my monologue, she was somehow related to lorenzo de Medici, the rich banker and patron of the arts... I think without him, Michelangelo wouldn't have had much of a chance. Well anyway, Katherine was jealous of her husbands mistress the entire marriage and this "other woman" was apparently some kind of famous harlot that hung around with all the royalty. I think I'll be able to pull of a green queen pretty well don't you?

      Ah well here I am once again. What can I say about today except that it's back to the old grind((life shattering, pain staking, it's not safe to chew on tin foil while you sharpen your nails on a black board, grind)).  my mother is having a nervous breakdown, and I'm not sure if I should laugh, cry, extend a shoulder, or leave it alone. Her and Steven broke up and then reconciled for a few hours then broke up again. So for the past week or so she's been unwieldy and sniffling and scarce. Every time they "break up" I tell her to quit crying and that they'll be back on in a few days, but this time I don't think that will be the case. All this misery for a guy? I guess that's just my mother. I told her that if she really loved him she would respect his decision and be glad he was happy, to which she replied  "but he's not happy, he's miserable"  "then what's wrong with you being together"  "bla bla bla same reason you can't divide by zero bla bla bla"  "then you have two choices," I said  "you can be happy he's happy, which you say he isn't, or you can relish his misery, either way, you've got a smile on your face"  "you're wise beyond your years." that's one of those things she says to me that I understand but refuse to register, since when is there an age limit on wisdom?  dinner's ready, more in a sec.

      As far as horribly depressing back to school and hating everything days go, I'd say this one fit the criteria to a T. I had a kind of bad feeling when I got to first hour English II and she had a BOOK of our assignments this month rather than a calendar. Research papers, explications, a page long monologue I have to write, memorize and perform in character, luckily renaissance writers didn't do many chokas or tankas, but still, only morehead could make me want to die in less than an hour. The rest of my classes stayed the same except that all the teachers had that overzealous snip and need for organization and "fresh slates" that comes with the new year and should clear up by tomorrow.  Eghck, I was supposed to go to Barnes and Noble with Emily today, but she called while I was at the store and I got off track, that kind of thing.  Oh and also, for that renaissance monologue, I have to have a costume! I hope I can find something to wear, even if it would be cool to have a fancy ruffly dress made. morehead said the hardest part of the assignment would be to BECOME the character and put words in their mouth, drama class don't fail me now...  Well it's 8:30 and I've done everything I was supposed to, I think I'll rundown my buddylist real fast and see who's not ignoring me, then I'll maybe play with some html?

      I can't believe this vacation is over and I actually have to go to school tomorrow, that REALLY REALLY sucks. So of course mom was flitting around singing about it when I got up this morning. She left me here with Devon and mammaw so she can go see Steven. They supposedly broke up, yet they still go out for lunch?  Today being the end of something fun((vaca)), I am expected to do more cleaning than usual. With four hours sleep to go on and piles of laundry and dishes to do, a room to clean, and a million other odd chores, I feel fairly overwhelmed. But the worst of it is over, I think, since I've already been in the driveway in my pajamas in the 40 degree weather sweeping miniscule amounts of kitty litter into a dustbin. It wasn't a lot! The kind of little pile that the wind could blow away! But alas, what would the neighbors think about that? I only left it there because I knew our litter was biodegradable and it wouldn't matter anyway, oh well. It's not like I died or anything, just got me cold and pissed off.  I hate AOL I hate AOL I hate it more than anything else on the planet. The stupid parental controls have made it so that I can't even visit my own blog. I've already had to quit reading a couple other ones because I couldn't visit them, but it's ridiculous! It's not soft porn or how to build a bomb I'm writing here!  Isn't my drop-down menu nifty? I built it myself. I also got this thing that will send me an IM every time someone visits my site. I'm totally obsessed with the traffic on this thing, minimal though it may be.

      I've been on a blog reading adventure the last couple days((as you can tell by my noticeably fatter links list)) but I think I'll be done searching for a while as I have found the coolest blog ever called "No Milk Please". It's this gay Asian guy and his stuff is great. Definitely read his post titled "R is for Responsibility".   I think I need a blogroller.... Do I? Goodie! That can be my project for the next 10 minutes.

      It's 2:00, I just got up at 1:00, I feel like I need to bathe in expresso. I don't know why I slept so long... Could it have been the 9 hours sleep in 2 days I was trying to pull off?  That internet friend I made over at that girls house is on the links list.  I feel.... Like I wanna hug someone. No long winded conversations about phycology or philosophy or their favorite food, just a really long hug. Actions do speak louder than words I guess.

      shitpissfuck I had a really long entry here and this stupid AOL kicked me off and I'm too lazy to retype it all so I'll guess you'll get the super short version.  mood: kill me now...PLEASE noise: Pink Floyd- the wall and some crap James told me to download.  So my day with deux and Kelsey and Devon was mediocre. I'll just give you a run down of the events: we ate Mexican((yah)), we saw Mona Lisa smile((gag me with a jagged spoon and feed it back to me)), we went to the park and took pictures((I'm the prettiest one)), I found out mompat pitched in for my guitar((I have to like her from now on)) ((mammaw says she's trying to redeem herself)), daddy told me he wasn't a deadbeat and he didn't ruin Christmas and he HAS paid child support THROUGH January and mom was a crazy bitch, I told mom this and she had a cow and called him and screamed at him, he hung up, and now I think I can relax. They've been arguing about child supports a ton the last few months... Stress stress stress.  Katatonia is cool. No, not catatonia((lol))  Everyone on my buddylist has thier away message on, I need to find more friends.

      I love this song called "while my guitar gently weeps" and I'm almost positive you've heard it. I know beginning with the Beatles everyone who's ever sung has covered this song, but I like the Drowners version the best. Something about it is just like ~GRR that's good noise~

      mood: ecstatic noise: offspring  ohmuhgod I'm so happy!!!!  I'm getting a present from daddy on Monday, my guitar teacher ordered it for him and told me about it. I'll give you a hint:  it's black it's sassy it's a fender it's a stratocaster it's mine!  ::does the -very happy- happy dance::  And it's SO wonderful and it's got bitchin killin amps with super distortion to go with it and I'm just beside myself.  Tomorrow daddy and Kelsey((half sister)) will come into Shreveport to do the Christmas thing. Mom got him a calendar that I'm supposed to give to him, but I feel bad about it. It's a dumb calendar about books and I didn't even pick it out and it's really impersonal and silly so between now and 10am I need to find/buy/make him a good gift. I didn't get Kelsey anything either!!! I'm so well prepared aren't I?  Today was kind boring aside from the mountain of shrimp and broccoli from imperial wok I ate, it was tasty. Maybe this day wasn't really that boring and I'm just incredibly tired and can't appreciate it?  I'll just do a load of laundry then be off to bed then...  coughfendercoughstratcough

      mood: eghck((yes, eghck is a word)) noise: chili peppers-californication((one of the best songs ever))  well I considered not blogging about this but here I go anyway.  I went bowling, I had fun, I got invited to a girl named alicia's house, so I went. Maybe I'm a pompous bastard who leads a semi-charmed life but.... I don't even know how to spit out what I'm trying to say! And this is my freaking blog and I'll probably never meet the people who read this but it's just hard so I guess I will shut up about it.  so all night long tiff and I sat around and watched movies while allie talked online with her 8 thousand internet boyfriends. I got up to see what they were talking about and these people((who are all waay older than her, she's 13)) seem to really care about her. Once again I'm a pompous bastard who shouldn't judge, but I don't know what they see in her. It's their businesses I suppose. Then she went off and yammered on the phone with one of these people((does she know how dangerous that is?)) and I hopped on to see what they were up to. Long winded piece of this story short, I made a new friend named nick and I got his screename and he's an internet geek like me. Then allie called nick and I said hello and she stayed on the phone with him until 4am. Ok so bla bla bla I got three hours sleep, we walked a couple blocks to tiffanys house and I seriously almost got runover!! We had this one huge intersection to cross and I was supposed to stay on the median but I kept running and I was so scared and people were honking and Jesus Christ I'm never crossing the street again. I finally made it home in one piece though and I'm glad.  the bowling part of the night was great and I like the holiday something alley in bossier better than the one here. We decided we need to go more often and get more people to come with us. Oh by the way, I am the worst bowler ever. My high score of the night was 48... Maybe I don't throw the ball right?  I just switched to some of ~The Clash~, I love them!  London calling to the underworld Come out of the cupboard,you boys and girls London calling, now don't look at us All that phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust!

      I'm going bowling with tiffany and some other people I don't think I know. I haven't been bowling in forever! Hopefully I'll have tons of fun, I think I deserve it, but I'm sure I will anyway, tiffy is a riot. Hopefully Ashley can give me a ride home though, mom doesn't seem too happy about hauling me to Bossier. Best go find something to wear and hop in the showah.

      mood: yaaaawn noise: something corporate  I can't believe I stayed up so late, especially since I was doing absolutely nothing. So I woke up at 1:00 and mammaw has already deleted kazaa. Is it just me or is she a little too OBSESSED with this INTERNET RESTRICTION thing. It wouldn't have hurt anyone to leave it on there so the rest of the songs((i.e. the ones that had no sources at 4AM i.e. most of them)) could finish downloading. I guess I should be glad she let me have it at all, but sometimes I wonder if maybe she should have some kind of life outside of fixing the computer so that I can't do things I want to regardless of if it hurts anyone or not. We're not talking porn here, we're talking music, food for the soul!  My buddylist is unusually empty, I suppose everyone is sleeping late because they partied all night. I'm sure I'll be hearing all about lauren's wild new years with people older than her ((OOH)) and maybe even a wine cooler ((DOUBLE OOH)). Honestly I don't understand peoples weirdness around alcohol, which is probably a good thing since I won't ever feel like I have to. My mom has never done that whole it's bad it's bad it's bad thing, and I appreciate that. She also said if there was a drug I wanted to try let her give it to me, which I'm sure if I ever expound on that offer you'll know about it.   I think I just used expound incorrectly. I'm constantly looking up words in the AOL dictionary because I think I would feel supremely stupid if I ever misused a word in conversation.

      Well happy new year to all of you out there in internet land. This is my fresh slate for 2004, same layout and stuff, but nothing, absolutely nothing from 2003.  so I convinced my grandmother to let me have kazaa *just for tonight* and I'm sampling some sigur ros. It's beautiful and islandic, the kind of thing that could lull me into a long, peaceful, and dreamed filled sleep. It's got lots of violins and long velvety foreign words and I'm loving it.  At one time I had complete control over my dreams and could do wonderful things like turn on lights or wake up knowing bits of a new language.((that would be astral projection, for those of you out-of-the-know)) but somehow I've lost that talent. These days my dreams just channel my frustrations and come out looking like a red hot chili peppers video. Except for these love-longing dreams I've been having lately in which I have found the perfect person and I am so in love and at peace and happy that the edges of my subconscious will me to stay asleep. It's kind of wishful thinking to the extreme I guess.  I'm 41 minutes into the new year and it's boring me already.  Ugh nikki didn't blog today. This is probably partly my fault since I spent 2 hours spouting philosophical mumbo-jumbo with her, but it WAS a really great conversation. I get a really satisfying feeling when I know I've had a really good conversation and made a connection with someone. It's the kind of thing that doesn't happen too often because people are "busy" and won't listen because they feel strange taking advice from someone as young and "ignorant" "stupid", "immature" as me when in fact they are the immature ones unable to swallow their piggish ideals and just hear someone besides Dr. Phil.   Shaney waney paney naney((lol)) blogged today. Yes I do still read it and((I'm channeling my mother on this one)) even though it is misspelled you put my last name in there and someone is going to track me down and kill me so could you please take it off and put G instead? But keep it up shoog, I looove to be mentioned in blogs((hee))  Shaney waney paney? I must need to go to bed. But I'm not tired and I have *just tonight* to get my fill of kazaa so I guess I'll keep talking.  what is it with me and calling people shoog? It's kind of a system I made up of hons, shoogs, and darlins. hons are "friends" or acquaintances, shoogs are more well liked than hons, and darlins are the people I like the most. I suppose that's kind of mean, shouldn't I like everyone the same and not rate them? nah.  I was thinking the other day on how my whole persona changes depending on who I'm hanging out with or talking to. Like with Jonathan and jean I act kind of silly and with Andrea I act downright retarded and with candice or Sarah I act all nice and  boring and with people I don't know very well I am either very dumb or very serious and with a particular group of friends I'm very blunt and out there and with my family I'm kind of sarcastically quiet and around boys I'm kind of sardonic and hokey. All of these different sides of me are different levels of trust. How much I trust their judgment, whether or not they will tell my secrets, their tolerance for my oddities, and their personality overall.  I'm listening to Ageatis Byrjun, it's so lovely ::sigh::  I think I'll go a-looking for some new blogs to read, Mary Kate has given up I think, and I'm feeling like empathizing for some reason.

      Still alive.   before I launch into this thing I want to mention the little newsletter thingy on the left/bottom. I stole it from troy and I think the idea is genius and everyone who ever thought about blogging should get one. So everyone sign up and that way we'll never have to visit blogs that haven't been updated and there will be world peace.   this week((and I'm sorry for not posting)) has been fairly exciting. That is, if you were watching me. Most of the highlights of the past seven days have included myself and something coming in contact with my head. So I'll start from the beginning.  Saturday((2-21-04)) was great. We went to the parade and had pizza and tacos for dinner and stayed at the Horse Shoe((hotel)). It was me, tiffany, Sarah, sarah's cousin who's in college and we invited at the last minute, Lauren, and 3 other people who don't count since they were Devon and her two friends. Towards the middle of the parade((not the 2 hours we hung out at the park waiting, the actual parade))((they were late getting started)) sarah's cousin's friend came and met us. His name is bo, and he's fabulous. He stayed in the hotel room until 5am debating the meaning of life with mom and I and explaining some of the more detailed aspects of quantum mechanics. He was quite fascinating, and we'll be having lunch with him some time soon. But of course, the other girls((not having a taste for quantum mechanics, I assume)) were bored to sleep by 2, leaving me to stay awake all night, get 3 hours sleep, and be a zombie the next day.   on Sunday, while intensely groggy, we went to the krewe of highland parade and had a pretty good time. The best part, however, was seeing Steven((mom's oh-so sophisticated bf)) dressed as a can of SPAM((riding on the "super heroes" float, no less)). Apparently his daughter has a "thing" for SPAM and he bought that costume at the SPAM museum on their SPAM-themed road trip to...... Montana??? Missouri??? Minnesota??? whatev. So of course, he was the funniest thing ever, and I have crowned him "the sexiest can of SPAM ever" which to me, is really fucked up. But anyways, after the parade we went to a BBQ at the neighbors and despite my exhaustion, I got a goddam second wind and stayed up til midnight cleaning my room.   Monday through Thursday were pretty much a big blur, as many of my weeks are. This week only being different because many of the days were literally blurry due to the serious head trauma I had received. On Wednesday I was playing volleyball((yes, it's another volleyball wound)), and that damn thing was spiked right into my head. When it first happened it didn't seem so bad, but I've now come to realize that my left ear isn't working very well, making this this one of the few injuries I've had that weren't hysterically funny afterwards.  oh and prior to the volleyball incident, I was sitting with my mom, who was crocked in her room. We were talking about daddy and I rested my chin on her knee. I must have said something that pissed her off because she jerked her knees and slammed my jaw in between them, hitting a couple glands and doing some damage. Once she did it I ran to the bathroom and cried. I think I was more upset over the fact that she wanted to hurt me than about her actually doing it, even if it did hurt.   later on in the week when mom and mammaw were fighting about bills I was upset so I ran to the bathroom and cried. Then I touched my jawline and was reminded and cried some more, then I touched the spot where Devon hit me and was reminded and cried some more. I was sad.   then on Thursday was when I got it big time. I was sitting in bed with my mom watching TV, it was around 9, so Devon was already settling down for sleep, but was still awake because mom and I couldn't quit singing the sugar booger song, which I will sing to you later.    goddamit goddamit goddamit goddamit goddamit AOL! I had a foot of blog entry that I hadn't saved yet and that motherfucking #^#%^-sucking AOL got a glitch and deleted it! OMG I could run right up to whoever wrote AOL and fucking kill them right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so I guess I'll start rewriting my WHOLE ENTIRE POST NOW.  so I was sitting with my mom and then I poked Devon and she reared up and started clobbering me. At first I was laughing at her, since she was going at it so fiercely and not really hurting me that bad, until she threw herself back and punched me in the face. I was flabbergasted! Squarely between my eyes! That little motherfuck! So after a few minutes of howling/crying/hyperventalating/thinking my nose was broken and dabbing an almost undetectable amount of blood from my nostrils, I went back to my mom's room and acted like nothing had happened. Even replying to my mother's fuss with "oh please, like one clop in the head from THAT little bastard could affect me". But of course that shitass couldn't keep her mouth shut she had to give a fake, sickening "sorry, but ya pissed me off" with the same tone as one might say "sorry kid, but it was for your own good". Was excruciatingly mad. But luckily you can't see anything unless you look really close, and I'm sure I'll GET OVER IT like I always do.   on Friday night I went over to sarah's house and watched movies and ate and played pool and danced around. it was fun. I got home around midnight and slept good.  this morning I woke up and struck a sort of deal with mom that as long as I kept doing everybody's chores, she wouldn't bring Devon home((hmm.. Manual labor or seeing your sister??? Manual labor it is!)). So around 2 I had the house completely spotless and of course, mom lied and said she was going to the store but she actually came home with the bastard. So all my efforts to keep her gone were futile. I was taken advantage of, duped, screwed over, pissed off.  so I spent a good part of the afternoon being pissed off. I was so pissed off I mopped the floor. But then mom and mammaw started fighting and I forgot about my own little vendetta. After they yelled a while we cooked dinner and now "it's all good" so I'm not supposed to care.   will I always be expected to get the fuck over it?   so now I'm here, retyping my lost blog entry, and they still had the nerve.... After all I did... To make me do more chores and let deviance friend come over, leaving me on the couch tonight, and that smelly little girl in my bed. Which means I'll have to wash my sheets tomorrow.   after everything, it all boils down to the fact that I have sheets to wash.  oh, the sugar booger song. We heard this on bob and tom the other morning and thought it was really funny. I don't know all the words((and mammaw won't let me have kazaa)) so I'll sing everything I remember:  ((E5 power chord))((dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun)) I picked my nose I got a booger I put some sugar on it it was a sugar booger and then I ate it  hopefully I can fenaggle kazaa for a couple hours so I can make it my song of the day, because it was really funny.  here's something weird I thought of. If everything in nature occurs in threes, and everything outside of nature occurs in fives, then wouldn't that make multiples of fifteen important somehow?? Should I just quit thinking?? That was retarded...  NO RAIN All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watchin' the puddles gather rain And all I can do is just pour some tea for two and speak my point of view But it's not sane, It's not sane  I just want some one to say to me I'll always be there when you wake Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made  And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I start to complain that there's no rain And all I can do is read a book to stay awake And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape escape...escape...escape... All I can say is that my life is pretty plain ya don't like my point of view ya think I'm insane Its not sane...it's not sane. -BLIND MELON-

((quit flattering yourself)) ((nope))  i'm going to the parade, i'm not sure with who, but it will be fun and we'll stay in the hotel tonight and go to another parade tomorow and it will be all good.  mamaw's back to her normal bitchy self, she's been yelling at me to clean stuff all morning.  lauren((lives across the street)) invited dev to stay last night and not me. it made me feel kind of bad since i was kind of standing right there and she could have as many people as she wanted.   oh well!!!

      yes i'm here.  nothing happened today except that i found out my grandmother DOES NOT have cancer and that my sister is a really crappy eavedropper punk. she went to the doctor and had a colonoscopy and there's nothing wrong with her. i'm glad.  today was pretty boring. i had a french exam, but i think i did good.   tomorow i'm going to the parade and it will be a blast. it makes me miss being IN the parade. bess didn't come to school today, but hopefully she's alright and she'll call me later on. so it will be me, sarah, and bess. a nice little bunch. plus there will be one of devons stupid friends, but they don't count.   daddy sent me $100 so my friends and i could have fun tomorow. so it will be pizza and coke all around with bunches left over so i can be rich. bwahahaha. got-ta-love-my-dad-ee-oh.  i wish i had a kitten. lately i have been desperately yearning for a kitten. but nobody will get me one and it's incredibly depressing. i love my big cat max, but he's lonely. before we got rid of mei-ling and merlot, he never cried so much, and now he's really needy and no matter how much we try to love him he ignores us and keep whining. but anyways, i suppose i shouldn't ache for something i won't have until i move out, and seeing as how i'm 14, that could be a long time.

      goddamn this aol. i lost another big giant post!  i'm at home, online, ok. mom is drinking and seems to have forgotten grounding me yesterday.  i said that if i didn't get any mexican food today i would die for lack of semi-ethnic food. so i guess i will just DIE! i saw a comedian talk about mexican food once on comedy central, i always watch that friday night stand up. he said something along the lines of: "ok so i go into a mexican restaurant and the waitress comes up to me and says "what would you like?" and i say "what's a taco?" "tortilla with meat, cheese, and vegetables" "uh huh and what's a casadilla?" "tortilla with meat, cheese, and vegetables" "yes, and what is a burrito?" "tortilla with meat, cheese, and vegetables". well it was funnier when he did it, but you get the point.  i have to write a comparitive essay for my final exam in english. why do i care now? because we get to choose our own topics and i might actually put effort into schoolwork ((more than whats required by law, that is))((but i still maintain my A-B average)). i'm thinking i'll do a "Comprehensive Comparison of Modern Surrealist Art and Modern Abstact Art, With Emphasis on Dali and Picasso". people are constantly getting the two of them confused!!! it drives me nuts! i say "yeah dali and bosch are cool" and they're like "ooh you like abstract stuff like that? i just like the picture with the lady and she's almost smiling but not really and i think it got stolen one time and i'm a retard la ti da". but anyways, i'm sure i could find many a candidate to debate the philosophy of non-conventional art, but i figure no matter how long we go at it i'll still think i'm right anyway. ((wink wink))  today was good considering everything i'm supposed to be worried about. i don't think i mentioned the fact that i'm not supposed to know my grandmother is sick and that i only foud out by eavesdropping, so i think i'm supposed to pretend i don't know anything until somebody decideds to tell me. alas, i am never out of the loop! these people are waaaay too sloppy. ((i love using the word alas))((alas))((alas! alas is one of my favorite words!)). so in the midst of feigning naivity i aced 3 tests, chilled out, and learned some fascinating new stuff in geometry. i am sooo taking trig, which is what we're doing now. ((trig in geometry? whatev)).   so now i'm gonna steal a couple topics from other people's blogs. TIF reminded me of Amish people. i love Amish people, they rock. it's kind of weird though... i mean they're so religious and close minded... that i would think they were cool. but i went to iowa and met a girl my age who was Amish, and i think it was her... zest? that made me like them so much. the fact that her life was complete and that she didn't yearn for anything more, the fact that consisstency and tight-nit groups of farmers were comforting and the right thing rather than an awful bore and a terrible way to live. amish just... apreicate everything. and that makes me apreciate them.   ((plus they make kickass fudge and booya cheese, which is about 50% of the Amish love i feel))  and the other day i was thinking about the disney channel and then BOOKGIRL mentioined it and i decided it would make a good rant((why does the word 'rant' appear so often in blogs))((could it be because that's exactly what they are?)). anyways, i digress:   i think the disney channel is majorly fcuked up. why? becuase THERE ARE ONLY THREE FRAKING PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THAT CHANNEL! and it true!!!! everybody on that channel: 1. has thier own show 2. randomly appears on all the other disney shows 3. have thier own cartoon character that they do the voice for 4. appear SOMEWHERE in almost all disney movies, even if they are just walk-ons 5. have thier own "singing careers" so they can be played on "radio disney" 6. appear in the disney commercials and do the little announcer voices for the disney channel and finally 7. have thier own mini-specials on disney so we can "get to know them better".   the most obvious example, of course, is hilary duff. and even if most of what she does gets on my last nerve, i say more power to her and if i was as hott as her, i'd strut it too. and also that little short fat kid that looks like a midget but i don't know his name.  speaking of midgets, i like reality tv((as many people don't)), but sometimes it goes too far!!!! like on "The Littlest Groom" a midget version of the bachelor, i mean, COME ONE PEOPLE! and besides, isn't singling out small people bad? and also there is a new one called "Straight Plan for the Gay Man" ((can anyone say copyright infringement?)), a spoof on Queer Eye and yet another stupid show. my favorite reality shows are survivor, star search, and american idol, and i suppose the last two are more of televised talent shows, but whatev.   i think i'm going to invite shane for sushi with me. betcha a million dollars he's never tried any raw eel wrapped in fungi and soaked in soy bean essence. actually that was a tad exxagerated, sushi is the bestest! and i only eat the cooked eel, it's too chewy raw.   i have bla bla trig to do and i have to read "Night" ((please god say you all know which book i'm talking about)), which is extremely depressing, gruesome, and downright mind warping. but hey! morehead wouldn't assign something without those qualifications! and besides, it's kind of inspiring in a crematorial, using babies for target practice kind of way.  that was a yucky note to end my blog on, so perhaps this is better:  do yall know how jellyfish reproduce?! it's amazing! the male and female jelly fish spit out gametes and they form a bud on the ocean floor which then forms layers of disks and when there are lots of layers, the disks flake off and turn into baby jellyfish!   and sorry for not spellchecking... butt i donut hav tiem

      Well...  .......  I have ample reasoning for conclusion that today was a shitpile, a disaster, a complete and total fuckup.   on the way to school mom mentioned((to someone she was on the phone with)) that she needed to go straight home because strangely enough, mammaw had asked her to and said they needed to have a serious talk. So I spent the better part of the morning conjecturing the details of this "serious talk" and came to the conclusion that when mammaw went to the doctor on Sunday he told her that her health was diminishing and that the cat would have to go. After anguishing the thought of losing my cat, I had to take a biology test((which will be important in a second)). Now please don't think me a selfish bitch just yet. I decided that if something was wrong with mammaw she would have told us by now and that the cat was the only other thing in jeopardy, which is why I wasn't reeling over mammaw's health.  so about that test.. Of course, I had studied all the wrong things, every single minute piece of information not mentioned on that goddamn test I know by heart. The reason I would study so fervently? Mom said if I didn't make an  A on all 3 tests I took today, I would be grounded from the internet.   so as of tomorrow, I won't be allowed online.   I....  i don't think most people would understand the way I am totally cut off at the knees without the internet. Some people have sports, some people have best friends, some people have fabulous lives or are too ignorant to realize otherwise. I, however, am not one of these people, I have an internet hookup and a knack for typing. blogging is my refuge, the way I center myself, the little part of my day when EVERYTHING is about me. My feelings. My ideas. My own selfish ramblings.  and yes, I do depend on the sympathy of complete strangers((well, strangers on some levels)) to keep myself sane, and yes, I believe without the sympathy or sharing of joy with others we'd all clutch stuffed animals, rock back and forth. And feel sorry for our own existence until we died. died wallowing in self pity. Died feeling that nobody cared. So do I feel this need to blog because "nobody listens to me!!"?? Maybe. But probably not. I simply enjoy it for the sake of space. space in my own head, that is. I take all these woes and throes and throw them into the computer, taking solace in the fact that somebody will know about it besides me. That somebody might have a solution, or a philosophy, or just a kind word.   I also do it because my ego tells me I have good ideas, and that I should spread my genius among the people. But that's besides the point.   enough spew about that.   I'm home now, enjoying my last day as a legal blogger, and thinking about mammaw.  her talking with momma had nothing to do with the cat.  my grandmother has colon cancer.   and you'll have to forgive my indifference towards the situation at this moment, as the gravity of it hasn't had time to sink in yet.

      Just checking in  the Sims Bustin' Out is the best game ever. Really makes you contemplate your existence.  I haven't eaten today, and I have a serious craving for sushi. Unfortunately I'm the only one who will eat fish without batter or a frydaddy. I'm definitely going to have to find someone to go with me. But who...  candice called and invited me to Juri's. I said no, because I don't have a ride, I don't like juries, I don't want to go anywhere, and I MUST study for my biology test.  gag me I don't feel like going back to school!! But it will be a short week, and hopefully I will do something interesting next weekend.  Mr. Beach canceled. It's ok though, I haven't practiced much. I wonder what kind of presidents day function he's playing at?  this was an extremely uninteresting post.

      bluh bluh bluh  I haven't done ANYTHING this weekend except play this stupid Sims game, which I am addicted to.  last night I babysat((never a fun job)) until 1:30, then came home and stayed up until 4 freakin o' clock, which wouldn't bother me if it hadn't screwed up my sleep schedule. I'm trying to psych myself into the fact that it's 10:00, but in my head it feels like around 6:00 or 7:00. ((well maybe you shouldn't have slept until 1:00 in the afternoon?? Well maybe I wanted to! Well maybe you shouldn't!))  tomorrow is president's day, and like most holidays, I wouldn't care except that school's out. It's the fact that I have to go back to "that place" on Tuesday that I think is making me depressed. And it's not really in a sad way, I just feel like doing absolutely nothing, and the thought of all that studying and moving around I'll have to start doing soon is absolutely horrific.   after the kids went to bed last night I watched a Daria marathon on their satellite. I love daria, especially the way she talks in monotones and adds cultural references to EVERYTHING that most people wouldn't get and some of which I don't get.   we're carrying four leaf clovers, sending chocolates, and commending our presidents all in less than a week. Wild stuff huh?  I don't have much to say except that I'm severely hurting for some social interaction and hopefully SOMEBODY will call me up. But since I know that's not gonna happen, I'm just using this as an excuse to type.   "Everything in everybody's lives is out of control, we just tell ourselves otherwise so we can function"  I think I may have already said this, but I'm reading a book right now called Artemis Fowl((foul?)), and it's really good. It's about this 12 year old genius mobster who steals all the money from the fairy government. Very thrilling stuff.  this morning((afternoon)) I came in and had 19 messages. Now I NEVER have 19 messages because I'm on here so much and I always check them as soon as I get them. Most of them were valentines! I felt so loved!  oh oh I know what I can do! I can catch up on reading blogs.   w00t  ::failed attempt at being cheerful::  w00t??  ::nope::

      Today is Friday the thirteenth, tomorrow is valentines day. So I wonder how many retards forgot to throw salt over their shoulder because it spilled when the cap came off onto their eggs, which only happened because they broke their hand mirror trying to scare off a black cat, then walked outside and onto a crack, heard their mother scream in agony, which startled them, sending them crashing into the neighbors bed of thistles, then stood up and steadied themselves using the neighbors wooden fence and said "damn, the only thing I've got left is to walk under a ladder" without knocking on the wooden fence, then ran screaming from the thistle bed being chased by the homicidal old neighbor, only to run down the street, up a driveway, and underneath a ladder being used by the neighbors, who were busy painting their house hot pink ((it is a personal belief of mine that hot pink houses are bad luck, as we have four here in Shreveport)), and last but not least, they tried to slow down enough so as not to run into the neighbors house, but failed and smashed their lips into the freshly painted hot pink house, making their girlfriend think they had been cheating on her with someone who had bad taste in lipstick, which is why they won't be having a very good valentines day.  so.. Should I launch into my valentine's ((god I hate this holiday-what about the people without boyfriends-I'm going to die alone!)) day rant? Sure I should! Before I cared about having a boyfriend and being in love and yawed yahta, I loved valentines day, I sent candy to my friends, I wore red((but I always do that)), and I got a miniature whitman's sampler from my mom. But these days, it just kind of gets me down. I don't bother sending candy to my friends, girls as it may be construed as a lesbionic, and guys as it may be construed that I would like to sleep with them. I sit around, being bitter and eating chocolate that I bought for myself. But this year, I refuse. I'm going to be peppy, I'm going to babysat(($)), and I'm STILL going to eat lewd amounts of chocolate((but chocolate makes me happy so it's ok)).  next weekend is the Krewe of Gemini parade. I LOVE MARDI GRAS! It's so festive and royal and loud and drunk and sparkly and wonderful! One of the best nights of my life was when I was attendant to the duke of Arkansas and I got to ride on his float. It was special, because it wasn't the children's float that all the dumb kids had to ride on and throw crappy beads, and it was great. Unfortunately, I was so pumped with adrenaline and orange soda I don't remember much from that night, except that we went and ate at copelands afterwards and I spent the night with the duke and his wife, and we got home really really late because we went to the bridge closing ((where everyone goes on the big bridge at midnight and says goodbye to Mardi gras and they turn all the lights on and then you walk around and admire the costumes/floats and then kiss kiss go home))((it's the official end of the mardi gras season, if you didn't catch that)).   so next weekend I'm going to the parade with Sarah, Bess, and hopefully Emily. I know it will be a blast. Plus mom managed to get us a hotel room, so no worries about mamma.  oh by the way...     Happy   Birthday   Emily!     her actual birthday was Wednesday, and I crocheted her a scarf. It was red and had scalloped edges and fringe. She liked it a lot and I was glad because Emily deserves it.   lately Devon and I have had a big pacman thing going on((everyone over the age of thirty((20?)) can lose the images of darkened rooms and little yellow balls. This is baseman world 2, meaning he kills stuff and flies, no more chasing fruit around for him.)) so anyway, dev and I have been playing it like crazy, and we're about 3/4 of the way done.  my grandmother has taken to smoking in the house while my mom is out and it's choking me to death. Mom has been at the doctor all day, helping out her friend mike, who is my "uncle mike" because he was my grandpa's best friend before he died. Uncle mikes got all kinds of bladder diseases, so he's been having trouble. But mom and I make him soup and visit him sometimes, and he seems to be doing better.  daddy sent us valentine's day cards. That was nice of him. I really need to hop onto regards.com and send everyone an e-card.  hopefully this obese post ((with the bonus Friday the thirteenth spew)) ((har-dee-har)) will make up for my scarcity the last week or so. I plan to take up blogging daily again full speed ahead.

      Well I'm finally non-pissed off enough to come back and try blogging again.   what I wrote((and then lost)) was mostly whining about my mother anyway.  but I did say a few things about death worth mentioning. Mom told me a friend of a friend had died. I think that mourning over people is a waste of time and that wishing someone to come back is selfish. Think about it... They finally made it "out", they got to leave, and you think for a second they feel bad about it? No. I came up with a little analogy to go with this idea. If a crab leaves a shell, it hasn't died, it has merely moved on to a bigger and better place. So, should we mourn the shell? Should we be upset by the crabs loftier apirations to move on up? Should we bury, burn, sing to and/or cry over the meaningless shell and beg the crab to come back to it for out own enjoyment? No, because the crab would no longer fit in the shell, and he would soon die. So, hopefully that was comprehensible and a couple of funeral going/can't find closure/use a persons death as an excuse to be pitiful people are sitting at their computers thinking "ah".  got to be going for now, bell rang.

      Just checking in to let you know that I'm still here.   I was doing good, I was doing so good I wasn't even thinking enough to have a reason to blog. But it was a bad monday. Same kind of thing that happened the monday before last, only worse.   Had guitar this afternoon. My leads sound fabulous. Mr. Beach calls it improvision, to me it's more like rolling a ball really hard inside a fence and letting it ping the sides of the barrier. I'm 99.9% positive that didn't make sense to anyone but me.  I will maybe get on here later and explain some stuff... If not if will have to wait until lunch time tommorow.  I love being wanted.

      Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday.  i stayed up later than usual last night, and was so tired when i got up i decided not to go to school. So I'm here, momma is pissed at mammaw, mammaw is pissed at everyone, we might go see LOTR,  and it's all good.  the last two days haven't been so much hectic as they have been... Congested. I've had all sorts of tests and projects i needed to do, and mom has been gone the last two nights((meaning mammaw was here, and i wasn't going to be on the computer if she had anything to do with it)). But I'm here now, relaxing.  although mom hasn't been here and I've had tons of schoolwork, I've been in a great mood since Sunday night when my mom's old friend Michael came over. He's cool and extremely smart.  Monday was pretty slow, slow enough, in fact, that i don't really remember what happened.  Tuesday was about the same aside from going to gym and not being able to play. Since the ROTC kids were using the gym, myself and the little group I'm in went to the dance room. It was fun, i think i laugh more in that class than anywhere else. Jonathan made up blues songs and played his harmonica ((there's a skittle on the flo')) ((is pank and purdy)) and yeah! On Monday i do remember going to 5th hour and jean and Jonathan ex-plaining skiing to me. Then we got on the topic of sonny bono running into a tree and we were talking and then i couldn't decide if i would rather be run over by a car or ski into a tree. We debated on whether or not the tree would rip you in half, and decided that it all depended on the size of the trunk.  "Nothing is beautiful from every angle". Someone posted that on their blog, i don't remember who. We are reading The Tempest in world lit., my favorite quote came from that play. I'll put it on here:  For that he was a spirit too delicate  To act their earthly and abhorr'd commands  Refusing their grand hests, they did confine him  By help of their most potent ministers  And in their most unmitigable rage,  Into a cloven pine; within which rift  Imprisoned, he didst painfully remain.  most people wouldn't consider that a good Shakespeare quote, but i think it holds a lot of imagery. i especially love the last line, so poetic.  my backpack is full of change. i filled a bag with all the change i had in my piggy bank((ok it's not really a piggy, it's more of a jar)), and put it in a ziplock in my backpack with the intention of going to a friends house and playing poker. Well i never got to play poker, and i forgot about the money until last week when the bag it was in busted and change spilled in the bottom of my backpack. Now when i pick it up or move it at all, i make a jingle noise. It's become a kind of inside joke among my friends, which is why i haven't taken it out yet.  alright, you know you read too many blogs when you go to the recently updated list and two of the blogs mentioned there are ones that you already read daily. i thought that was funny when i surfed over and saw Benedict's Blog at the top of the list. i also added a little butterfly to my site, i think he's supposed to be a traffic monitor, but he was just too cute to pass up! i named him fucknoodle. ((noodle for short)). Oh and please let me know if fucknoodle is acting weird, he's supposed to just fly around and if he's messing up the template i need to chunk him.  lately I've noticed I'm more banged up than usual. i have a sore spot on my head from getting hit with a cup((thanks ricky and Brandon)), a bruise on each arm from rough housing with my mom((i licked her so she punched me? No fair)), a big red streak where i burnt the shit out of myself((thanks bleu cheese popovers)), a bruise on my chest from being hit with a volleyball, little blood blisters on my hand from hitting a volleyball too hard, and for some reason the top of my left thigh hurts and i have no clue how that happened. The weird thing is, i think it's all hilarious, getting pummeled by anything((volleyballs, cups, popovers)) hurts for about five seconds, but you laugh so long about it afterwards that it seems worth the band-aid.   ok, i know it's their blog and they should be able to do whatever they want... BUT I HATE POLITICAL WEBLOGS! THEY ARE SOOOO STUPID! WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING AN ONLINE JOURNAL IF ALL YOU DO IS COPY AND PASTE CNN ARTICLES INTO YOUR SITE, THEN PUBLISH IT AND LEAVE US WITH A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT! i mean really! i also hate blogs that have NOTHING but song lyrics on them. Now hold the phone, i like posting the occasional set of lyrics on here, but every single day!?!?! So we never actually get to know the person, we just know that they're good at hitting Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. Glad i got that off my chest...  i was really hoping the Panthers would win. But i heard the patriots have four LSU players on their team. Pooh.  i was trying to explain to mom about how spongebob is like drugs because you can allow yourself to relax your brain so much that you are almost comatose, yet you don't miss any of the underlying jokes. she didn't get it, and said that whenever devon leaves it on tv, she sees that starfish and thinks "penis penis penis!" i told her that if she ever runs across any star-shaped penises, she should give the enquirer a call. she laughed.  wow, i'm so... glad about everything. ((hope i'm not dying))

      Well it's Super Bowl Sunday and I'm finally back here blogging. Hope i haven't lost all my fans with my unannounced vacation from the internet.  Lately blogging has lost it's panache. The reason why? BECAUSE MY MOTHER KEEPS READING IT AND BOTHERING ME ABOUT IT. Now every time i feel like killing myself, killing everyone else, ect. I'm like "oh great and I'll have to listen to momma whine about it later".  Friday was the renaissance monologue thing. You know, i never realized what a ham i am!((caitlin, are you calling yourself fat?))((ha)). So i get up, squeeze into the iridescent blue nightmare, and have to go searching for my shoes((that are new)) in the goodwill bag((because my motherfcuker sister put them there to be mean))((and this all happened AFTER mom told her to wake me up early but she decided not to, making me extremely late))((growl)) so i finally got to school, hopped on the bus, and did my monologue for a whole bunch of kids who couldn't care less at three different schools. It was exhausting, but i still got to miss school and perform... Something i didn't even realize i liked so much.  Friday night Devon wasn't here ((w00t w00t w00t)) so i watched TV with mom and we had fun just chatting and enjoying the lack of bastardness that comes with Devon being out of the house. We also ate a really nice dinner, she had made a pork roast a few days earlier, so we cut it into slices, sauteed it in butter-garlic-lemon-thyme-olive oil, and ate it on hoagie rolls with feta cheese. It was super delicious.  Did anyone know that the guy who played Georgia in "Cold Mountain" was actually Jack White of the White Stripes? Turns out he did the majority of the songs for the soundtrack and so they gave him a part in the movie. ((go him!))  Saturday was pretty much a waste. i invited some people over for the game, made the batter for some bleu cheese popovers, and super-cleaned my room((in anticipation of my friends coming over today)). The only bad part((which was also kind of a good part)) was when Devon came home and would NOT help me clean our room, would NOT leave me alone, and would NOT even try a little bit to be even remotely nice. So because she was being more of a bitch than usual, mom screamed at her, and it made me smile.  In case you haven't noticed, i hate my sister Devon and i love whining about it.  Well now I'm here today, none of the three people i invited is coming over. But hey, it's more chicken wings for me. ((i could actually care less about the chicken wings right now, i cleaned my whole fricken room so they could call and tell me no))((i feel SO unloved!!!))  Mom is all pissed off because last night i ate some of the guacamole that was meant for today. Who cares?  I found some of my old journals((from before i had a blog)). It was really depressing, but at the same time, even though it's all about death and despair, it's quite poetic, maybe even in a good way. Perhaps I'll post some of it up here?....  Well crap, my very last hope of a friend during the game cancelled, and now i have nothing to do but sit around with these cromagnons and eat. Maybe I'll redo my template? i think it's been a month since i did it last. i think my blog has had more facelifts than Joan rivers, i saw her on the red carpet fashion thingy, and she gets scarier by the year.  ::depressed::

      I NEED A VACATION FROM MY VACATION, EITHER THAT OR I WILL EAT BANANAS TO MY DEATH.  oh gaaaaaawd!  I am going crazy! Nuts! Off my rocker! Out of my tree! Psycho!  yes, my aunt, uncle, and two cousins are here. I love seeing my aunt and uncle but DAY-AMN they have bad kids! Cameron is 3yrs. And the worst of the two, and Conner is 2yrs. And well, much sweeter and more well-behaved than Cameron. Since Sunday I have been chasing, yelling, grabbing, hiding, feeding, playing and scolding and I am worn to the nub. I enjoy Conner, he's very considerate and he loves playing with you, but Cameron.... Well he's horrible, a little monster. Of course I try not to play favorites but it's pretty hard when you've got one who wants to tell you he wuvs you and one who wants to throw plastic golf clubs at you.   it's Wednesday, only 2 more days until they head back to Ohio, and since Sunday I've totally charmed these kids. They love me to death, especially Conner... God he's such a sweetie. Yet even though I enjoy some aspects of the whole child-rearing thing, this much exposure to toddlers has only solidified my decision that I will have ZERO children even more.   they're so.... Slimy? whiny? Loud? Devilish? Smelly? Dirty? Annoying as hell?  aside from the obvious badness of the chitlins, I've been feeling very abused lately. Devon has been ignoring her obligation to chase kids because she's been getting ready for her trip, and everyone else seems to feel that it should be my responsibility to watch the kids.   I got my feelings hurt when everyone((my aunt, uncle, mom, grandma, and sister)) went to have manicures and pedicures and left me with the kids. BY MYSELF! I COULD HAVE DIED! The only upside I could find was that my uncle's feet are soft and silky, but other than that it was horrible to be left out of a family affair so I could stay by myself and wipe noses. It's kind of like last week when mom and Devon and Lauren went and had their eyebrows waxed and told me I wasn't invited. It all makes me feel pitiful, like a kid on a playground who doesn't have any friends. Oh well.   another thing that severely pissed me off: I had to cancel my guitar lessons so I could babysit for them! And since Cameron popped the strings last time I had my guitar out, poor acoustic and poor stratocaster are living in the closet. I'm like, majorly ancy to play, but I knoooow if I get them out the boys will throw a fit.   today was much better than Monday and Tuesday. Bess invited me to a movie and we went and saw The Lady Killers. Ok folks, you MUST all see this movie!!! It was definitely one of the best I've ever seen and it was hysterically funny. It's about a group of men, the leader of which is tom hanks, who((now close your eyes if you don't want me to ruin it for you)) tunnel through this old woman's cellar to rob a casino. Now this may sound a little... Eh, but it's not, it was a super fabulous movie and I hope everyone goes to see it. Plus I'm not gonna tell you how it ends, which is the best part.   before the movie we went to the mall and spent an hour at fucking American eagle getting shitmunch some... You guessed it... Underwear. I didn't think it was possible to spend SO much valuable time looking at the same 6 pairs of overpriced badly made tacky looking panties, but it IS and we DID. So dimwad got some ugly neon underwear and we were finally able to leave that godforsaken trough.   in case you haven't figured it, I hate stores like American eagle, abercrombie and fitch, Hollister, and Charlotte Russ. I think they are loud, stupid, overpriced, full of five-minute fads, and basically sell all the same shit. And another thing, if you've ever bought blue jeans and paid extra for all the holes poked in them, then you should wack yourself with a brick. When you will actually pay money for the factory to jab holes and rips through your clothes and then jack up the prices, you know you've got issues. I mean, seriously, they don't sell torn up blue jeans at GOODWILL. I understand if you like holes in your clothes... But for fuck's sake don't buy them like that.  so after the movie we went to old navy. Bess bought this cute orange hat and I got a pair of pants. When we got home we ordered Chinese from CHINA HOT ((oh yah!!!)) and it was tasty. After dinner I cleaned up the kitchen and spent the next couple hours wrestling kids. After a couple screaming fits we got them into bed and after a couple trips out of the bed and then back again, we got them to sleep.   yeah, I am bitching a lot about these kids, but I'm a Scorpio, and in case you don't know, scorpios love to share their things, but hate to share their territory. With the aunt and uncle sleeping in my bed and the boys dirtying my room, I'm totally on edge. Cameron has already broken a lamp and a ceramic angel((neither of which we told mammaw about before we threw the shattered knick-knacks in the trash)).  oh!! And I haven't even gotten to the bad part yet!!! Tomorrow Devon is leaving for her trip((which I am sick of taking up her slack for)) and Steven is taking the adults to lunch! I WILL BE WITH KIDS! ALONE! FOR HOURS AND HOURS! I will surely die, I will surely kill myself with bananas.  I found out the other morning that I'm allergic to bananas, which is weird since I used to eat them all the time. I was having one for breakfast that mammaw had bought out of the blue, and all of the sudden my throat closed up and I got all itchy. I was like "help" and mom was like "be quiet"!!! If I'm allergic to avocados I'll be pissed, because I love avocados and they're in the same family as bananas.   something I forgot to mention earlier, which is strange since it's so freaking funny, is that while Steven and momma were in Los Angeles, Steven went to the spa and had a fake fingernail put on his thumb!! And he loves it! You see, he got a fungus and lost a part of his thumbnail and it bugged him a lot, but then he just had a fake one put on and he loves it! When momma told me I was like:  "you know you're dating a girl, right?" "yep" "you know in most states, you're considered a lesbian?" "in MOST states."  I swear to god I've never met such a metrosexual. in fact I think Steven must have inspired the term. He gets manicures and facials and colonics and is pampered more than myself or most women I know. Now that he has this fake nail, I don't know what to think, it's just damn funny.   ((momma says he's not gay))  ((uh huh)) ((but she says he's too good in bed to be gay)) ((well, alright then))  well folks I believe that's all I have for you today. I wish I could blog more this week, but then again I wish I could relax more this week too. I think if I don't get some down time soon I might explode, but it looks like the only way I'm gonna get any R&R is if I get the flu again after they leave.  1. My favorite flower is an iris.  2. I've been to Canada, but never Europe((sob)) 3. I love bagpipes and all Irish music, like the chieftains! 4. I want to learn how to play a didjeridu.  5. I look exactly like my half-sister, even though we only share a dad. 6. It bugs me when people say I look just like my half-sister.

      I have decided to devote an entire post to the funniest thing that happened while I was babysitting.       Madelaine is sweet most of the time, put getting her to sleep is hell. She's always finding some excuse to stay awake and bother me. Be it water, teddy bears, stories, piss, monsters, or inexplicable needs to scream her fuckin head off, she WILL stay awake until SHE is tired.     So tonight I put her to bed fairly easier than usual and she only got out of bed once to ask me for something to put on a mosquito bite that she had scratched and irritated: "can you get me somethin' to put on my bobo so it stops itchin''?" "um I don't know where your mom and dad keep that kind of medicine but you can have a band-aid" "I know where it is!"     So she bounces into her parents' room and I follow her. When I get to the bathroom I find her standing on the toilet holding a tube of PREPARATION H. "is this the right stuff to make it stop itchin'?" so of course I'm like: "yup"     so I dab the hemorrhoid medicine onto a tiny band-aid and stick it on her forehead where the scab is and she's on her merry way.   mammaw like to have died when I told her.

      ::AT A LOSS FOR WITTY, INSIGHTFUL AND IRONIC TITLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS::  damn, today was tiring.  Thursday was boring and really really long. I remember thinking about how this day was so long it was like every minute stood out in relief against itself. I would stare at the clock and was able to count the time in between the seconds. And to top it all off, survivor wasn't even on.  Friday was even worse, as it was the last day of school before spring break, but when I finally got home I was able to truly chill, I just kind of splayed out like you do when you've been sucking your gut in trying to hide the fact that your dress is too tight but you're always competing with your stupid cousin on who's the skinniest so you've been sucking it in for like 6 hours and then you peel off the pantyhose and just.... Relax.  has anyone ever noticed that when you have an adrenaline rush, say like a concert or a big party or something, that you kind of lose your memory of the whole thing. Like when I come home, I feel like whatever gave me the particular rush actually happened the day before instead of hours before. It's weird.  to my own great satisfaction, I was able to flawlessly and legally get my sister into serious trouble. And regardless of how immature and stupid this sounds, it was grr-eat. This entire week every time the grandmother would tell her to do something she would mutter "fuck you, bitch" under her breath. So I, hating her guts as usual, told mammaw, who yelled at her, then mammaw told momma, who also yelled at her. Now she has been put in her place and maybe she will shut up for a while.   ((so pin a red rose on my ass!))  of course I don't think any of that will affect our relationship, she still managed to scream "SHUTUP" at me in the middle of the grocery store. I confronted her about the five bucks she owes me for writing her report a couple weeks ago. I swear to god if I have to sue her fuckin grandkids for that five bucks I will get it and I will be buried with it.   mom came home from Los Angeles Friday afternoon. She had a fabulous time, even better than she thought she would. She brought me three tee-shirts. One pink one((gag me.. Pink?!?)) that says Beverly hills, one that she bought at the airport that says new Mexico((WTF))((she bought it because it was all scrunched up into this tiny package and you pour water on it and it puffs into a shirt))((it's cool)), and my personal favorite, a shirt that says ROSCOE'S HOUSE OF CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. I've always wanted to visit Roscoe's since I saw it on food network. She said that she and Steven((her bf)) fixed a waffle and didn't touch it and said it was my waffle. I'm tearing up now just thinking about it.((yes, crying over a waffle, how will I ever manage?)).  mom says that she will take me with her and Steven when they go back in may. I did the smart thing and didn't get excited, but you never know.  now today... Saturday...  today was super busy. I woke up at 5 fcuking thirty because mammaw booted me off the couch where I had unintentionally sleep-walked. So then we went to wal-mart and bought dirt. Then we bought shit-munch an outfit for her banquet((shit-munch being little sister Devon and the banquet being some dinner she's going to which is included in a trip to Alexandria she'll be going on with her art class)). As if taking a shopping trip with Devon isn't draining enough, I then hauled the dirt to my ex-step-grandmother's house((Mimi)). So for like, 6 hours, I potted and watered and weeded and dumped and hauled and clipped and bullshitted and petunianated. Then I took a nice break for a couple hours and headed off to babysit at 5:30. So then I was finally home at 11:00 but I had to sweep and mop the floor so I did that too and now I'm finally winding down and ready to pass.   my uncle, aunt, and two cousins are on their way from Ohio right this minute. I don't know why they decided to strike out driving at 4 o' clock in the afternoon and drive all night long, which means I'll be stuck with kids while the aunt and uncle crash tomorrow, but they did so I guess there isn't much I can do about it now. Seriously, don't think I don't love them all to death, but they can be a handful and a half.  1. My adrenals are really messed up, so I never need to sleep as much as most people. 2. If I had to choose between being alone all the time and being with people all the time I would choose with people all the time. 3. My eyes are soo weird. They have a ring of blue, green, and light brown. My mom says it's because I don't get enough vitamins.... 4. I love making stuff, and I always have to have something to do with my hands.  5. For a couple hours after I read a good book, I narrate whatever I'm up to in my head. For example tonight I was thinking "as she dragged the mop across the floor and tried not to think about the futility of her actions, she wondered if there were any philosophical messages she could pull out of mopping. Finding herself at a loss for frilly words and answers to the world's problems embedded in household chores, she dragged her tongue across her lips and smirked."  so now I believe I will go to bed.

      FIND ME A BOX AND I'LL MAKE YOU FLY  I'll cut the box and make you wings and then you can fly to Italy and learn something.  love is like being a kite. Soaring blithely, carelessly, having no limitations but the one string that is your lover who keeps you from floating away or burning up in the atmosphere and you feel free and tied down at the same time because you ARE free AND tied down at the same time.   I am constantly wondering if there are people who love me without feeling obligated. If I didn't have a family and I just lived alone would there be people I could say love me? I'm always feeling like there is no one who would hear my name and think "she is amazing". I wish I had that effect on people. I wish I was magnetic and it was easy to get lost in my eyes and that folks flocked to me for insight, comic relief, friendship, everything.   what brought on this sudden need for attention? Well it could be that my mom is out of town but I know the reason is because this morning I came into class and said "good morning" to two people, neither of whom responded. I felt kind of like a kicked puppy. Is this my fault? Did they have something else so important to think about that they couldn't reply, leaving me feeling so crappy? I would think that if someone was so engrossed in their own thoughts that they would be running into walls all the time, but stupid mason and stupid nate seemed to be moving about just fine with the exception of their most disgusting faux pas.   sorry, but I had to tell someone. I've hardly been so insulted in my life.  why was that "under god" issue all over the news again today? I think they should take it out, of course, simply because the US is such a mixed up place and it would be easier for everyone. The best way I've found of convincing my religious friends is by proposing that what if a Buddhist bribed the government into changing it and we all had to say "one nation, under Buddha". This seemed to sway them quite a bit.  today I went and saw the Johnny depp movie. It was quite disappointing.   while I was at the movies I saw a man and what appeared to be his mother. The sight of these two struck me as.... I don't know. The man was gawky and sad looking, his clothes didn't fit, and he had the air((err, ere, are, hair?)) of someone who had been falsely accused and stomped all over. It was quite scary how much I was affected by the sight of him, but I immediately felt like grabbing him and asking him what he needed, I pitied him, deeply. I assumed that he was being cared for by his mother, although he was maybe.... 30? Because of the way he walked so strangely beside her, like a child.   I think maybe I felt this way about him was because he looked like Rick. Or, at least, Rick the way I imagine him now. I never really talk about my ex-step-dad, he's more of a nasty detail of my past, a means to the end of the catastrophe my life is now built upon. He was a nice guy, Canadian, and always touting some silly joke or trivia question. He seemed so good. He was an RN and worked a lot, but always managed to find time for taking us out on the boat or "family night". Then there was the summer... We never saw him, we never saw momma, we just sat and festered, festered and were too young to realize what was happening. Then one day it was all over, out in the open, a concrete piece of our lives. I remember all of it so clearly. mammaw coming to the house, barging into the bedroom to find the shell that was my mother, then coming out later and asking "why didn't you tell me, caitlin?". I didn't tell you because I didn't know, mammaw. I had forgotten I had a mother, I only knew there were two people who lived in the bedroom where I hardly ever went, one was supposed to be at work and the other was a lady I missed very much. I would come visit her occasionally until one night when I found her in the bathroom. She didn't know who I was, and she peed on the floor. I never confronted her about it because I was so afraid, so hopefully she won't read this. And then I remember finding out what oxygenated was. Just some little tiny pill.    I ache for the way my life used to be. We lived in such a beautiful house, and we had three cats and a chihuahua and mom would always make chicken with rosemary I picked from her herb garden and we would go out on cross lake and innertube on our barge and then we would watch movies and play rummoli together and momma and Rick would always sit and drink coffee in the morning and play cribbage and there was a family of raccoons who lived in the back yard and would come eat the birdseed at night and I would watch them through the huge window in the living room. and my room was so wonderful. About a month before we filed bankruptcy and moved out my mom and grandmother had redone my room exactly the way I wanted it. It was so beautiful and it made me happy and I had my own room that was decorated and now I don't have my own room and it's NOT decorated the way I want it and it makes me sad.   so yes, folks, that is my sad story. I don't know why I felt the need to bring it up now, but after typing and crying for 20 minutes I feel much better about some stuff.   Rick took the chihuahua and the big screen TV and himself to Canada. I think he's still on drugs and he calls my mom sometimes, whining about how his life is terrible and he misses her and all this crap.   well that's about all the reminiscing I can handle for now. I will tell you something though... As far as catastrophes go, addictions and bankruptcy are the most often ignored and people try to forget them as quickly as possible. I say this because in my own selfish self-pitying whiny way, I feel wholly unfondled when it comes to the whole thing. Seriously, I had NO parents for 6 months and I had to leave my house and now we live with our grandmother and hate our lives and I don't even get a sorry and a hug? I guess it's just one of those things that will have to wait for my therapist. If I ever get a therapist... If my therapist doesn't need therapy after picking at my brain...  there is a whole bunch more stuff I wanna talk about. Like gateway and Italy and what I'm gonna do with my life, but it will have to wait because I'm sick of this computer screen and I would like to go watch Witch Hunter Robin and think about pointless philosophical stuff.

      TO BLOG OR NOT TO BLOG... IS NOT EXACTLY A QUESTION.  it's more of a moot point. i knew i would blog sometime this week, i just haven't been able to find a nice quiet second or two. but luckily i have.   i've been extremely busy doing seemingly unimportant things. i've been mercilessly tioling away at making a scarf which i don't know what i will do with when i get finished but i know it will be something important like mailing it to some pop star under the pretense that i am a sick 8-year-old who can't do anything except crochet because of all the chemo. ((that was a little freaky))  i've been thinking a whole bunch lately also. i've thought about how maybe i'm a little too narcissistic. i've noticed that i spend a good bit of time looking at myself and thinking that i am the most beautiful creature ever and then thinking, "but according to today's standards, i'm NOT". so this is what i ponder. i do believe i am extremely beautiful, but i don't think abyone else does. seriously, though, it's turning into an issue for me. even while this page was loading((super slowly because i'm on a school computer)) i saw my reflection in the monitor and thought "i have such a nice shaped head, and my hair is sooo shiny and blonde and i'm like one of the lucky few in the population who have naturally blonde hair and it's soooo beautiful and i'm such a freak". but anyways, maybe that's just me. i suppose as long as i'm not admiring myself all day to the point where it's consuming my life AND i don't APPEAR to be self-absorbed and narcisisstic in front of others, i can continue believing all this crap.  mom left for Los Angeles on sunday. i got up at 3:30AM to help her put her crap in the car and tell her bye. she's having a fabulous time, she's visiting the set of angelina jolee's((sp?)) new movie AND going to meet her AND going to take a picture, she's been spa-crazy, eating amazing food, and soaking up the alive, wondeful, we-actually-enjoy-our-existence feelng of the place. i'm still insanely jealous, but i suppose there's nothing i can do about it. since she's not here, it's very quiet around the house. the only noise is mammaw and devon arguing, which they do constantly. as soon as devon leaves a room, mammaw starts mumbling, and as soon as mammaw leaves a room, devon starts explicitly conveying her opinions. it's really quite annoying.   speaking of such, mammaw is checking me out today and we're gonna go see the johnny depp movie FINALLY. i think i will be dissapointed, but you never know.   i have tons more to talk about, but the bell's gonna ring soon.  1. brussel sprouts make me puke((like, projectile, seriously)) 2. i've only had the flu once in my life.  3. my favorite guy is scott clifton. 4. i watch General Hospital EVERY DAY. 5. i love sushi and using chopsticks. ((w00t w00t tr0y)) 6. i think L33T is a crappy computer fad that will be over tomorow. 7. i love marshmellow peeps, a lot. a lot a lot. i like them microwaved.   hey nikki, did your CD ever come in the mail?

      Alright folks, enough is enough.   the glass:  the glass is not half empty, the glass is not half full, the glass is holding half of it's capacity, so stop imposing your philosophy of life on me using stupid glass analogies before I take this proverbial glass of mysterious liquid and throw it at your head.  I find that regardless of whether I am in a good or bad mood, I can always come to the same conclusion: that happiness is ignorance, and that if you're not ignorant, then you're in denial.   think about it, when people are happy, it's only because they don't know about their other problems yet, either that or they just ignore the problems they already have until they blow up in your face.  blogging is kind of like solving problems but not really, it's just my special way of feeling better. I come here and throw-up and the internet feels sorry for me and then the next thing you know I have more stuff to throw up.   it's an endless, ravenous, horrible cycle, and I like it.   does EVERYTHING have to become a problem? Can't I take a fucking piss without upsetting someone? No, because if I piss too long they'll think I'm mad at them so they blame someone else so those two start fighting so the other one tries to mediate but after several hours of careful dissection of my long-winded piss, they come to the conclusion that the third person is at fault but the third person, being selfish and stupid, blames it on me, who already knew the long piss was my fault in the first place, as I was the only one who drank all iced tea, which is also bound to piss someone off.  And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is the story of my life...  And from the womb of hell springs the brightest angel, who being ignored, finds solace in wrong-doing.  ((I made that up))

      WELCOME TO THE BATHTUB-NO SKINNY DIPPING ALLOWED  well.... The reason I haven't blogged lately is because I've had so much on my mind the thought of putting it on paper scared me, but it's Friday night and, of course, I have nothing to do, so here goes.  we finally finished testing. It was the easiest one I think I've ever taken and I can't believe it's all I have to pass to get my diploma.   mom is leaving for Los Angeles on Sunday. For me this is extremely upsetting. Although I am not sure whether it's because she relishes rubbing it in my face in the most childish of manners or if I feel bad for not being happy for her. everytime she launches into one of her stupid "I'm going to Los an-gel-es" songs, I all of a sudden wan bawl my eyes out. Maybe it's because I can't imagine a mother being so immature and childish or if I want to go THAT badly.  while on the subject of my mother I suppose I will launch into the very pitiful movie pouting whining mom is mean THING. She said she would take me to see the Johnny depp movie with her and this made me happy. Well some plans didn't work out, there was a misunderstanding, and she ended up not taking me. I didn't really mind since I didn't really need to be checked out of school, and I figured we could do it Friday night. So Friday rolls around and she is going to see the movie with beau. Remember beau, the really awesome quantum physics dude from Mardi gras? Well anyways, she's been hanging out with  beau  all week. Hearing this, I immediately ask if I can join them expecting a yes since he is kind of my friend also but she says no. So I keep bothering her and she still says no. This REALLY hurt my feelings. I thought we would have a little mother-daughter time before she left to go to the only place I've wanted to go since I could form coherent thoughts. But NoOoOoO! She wants to spend all her time with somebody else.   I hate this. I hate the way she rubs it in. I hate the way she's having dinner with Mel Gibson and rubs that in the most. I hate the way she won't take pictures or go to anywhere that matters. I hate the way she tries pacifying me by promising to bring back miniature soap from her stupid fancy hotel. I hate the way she's not even gonna visit the museum or the walk of fame. I hate the way this is bothering me so much but it wouldn't be bothering me so much if it weren't THIS place.   why would I lose a phalange to go there? Because stuff is happening. Because it's not a desolate wasteland where people are too lazy to even try to make themselves happy. Because it's the opposite of Shreveport. The fact that all of those wonderful movie stars and landmarks and interesting things to do are there helps too.   alright, I think I'm done whining about that. Doing all this yammering isn't going to get her to come home from that stupid movie and apologize. Besides, mammaw says I can go see it with her on Sunday afternoon((oh, joy...)). And it's not that I don't like being with mammaw, it's just that this was supposed to be a caitlin-mom thing. No arguing, no sharing with anyone else.   that movie will suck anyways... And so will her trip... ((not))((not))  I got invited to go to a boys house and do some drugs and other stupid crap like that. He told me to call him on Thursday but I didn't. I think I will tell him I got food poisoning. Besides the fact that I don't wanna do that sort of thing, I would be the only girl there with like.. 4 guys. It would be weird.  on Wednesday, I got a horrible feeling. My stomach dropped and all I could think about was that shane had been hurt and I couldn't imagine why I would think that since I haven't really talked to him in forever. I haven't been able to get a hold of him, so that "feeling" is still churning my guts, making me wonder if he fell off a cliff. Well since we don't actually have cliffs in Shreveport, it would have to be something less glamorous, like getting run over. Hopefully I'll talk to him eventually and I will quit thinking about it. Like when he gets out of the hospital or when my grandmother finds his obituary in the paper...  why DOES my grandmother read the "obitz"((as she likes to call them))?? Does it make her feel more alive?  I had a dream this morning that I was taken hostage with a whole bunch of kids and I had to pretend that I wanted to get married to some girl I didn't know so that I could escape and give this thingy back to Bernie Mac so that he could save the world. It was kind of weird, and I've had a similar dream before.   when I'm a senior I'm going to take psychology. I know I would love psychology. One of these days I will read a book on Freudian psychology. He was a genius, he may have been a little off on some stuff, but he was still an innovator.

      ALAS! THE TURKEY DRAGON IS HERE!  ágætis byrjun   bjartar vonir rætast er við göngum bæinn brosum og hlæjum glaðir vinátta og þreyta mætast höldum upp á daginn og fögnum tveggja ára bið fjarlægur draumur fæðist borðum og drekkum saddir og borgum fyrir okkur með því sem við eigum í dag setjumst niður spenntir hlustum á sjálfa okkur slá í takt við tónlistina það virðist enginn hlusta þetta er allt öðruvísi við lifðum í öðrum heimi þar sem vorum aldrei ósýnileg nokkrum dögum síðar við tölum saman á ný en hljóðið var ekki gott við vorum sammála um það sammála um flesta hluti við munum gera betur næst þetta er ágætis byrjun  -Sigur Ros  that song makes me want to just... be content. not just content is some regard, but so completely happy i could just die and flaot away and never have to worry.  testing was today. not much to say there except that it was insultingly easy.  mom was taking diet pills today. she wants to be skinny for her trip to L.A., so we have to put up with her crazyness that comes with not eating and taking what is, in essence, speed. when she takes diet pills, she has a different smell. when i got in the car, i smelled it and immediately knew. it's kind of weird, i guess.   i seem to have a certain smell ID for everyone... like mammaw smells like cigarettes, micheal((mom's genius friend)) smells like leather, mom smells like her soap and well--- mom, and the kids across the street smell like baby shampoo and macaroni. i can seriously think of a smell to match everyone, even people i haven't met. nikki, i would guess paper and fancy hair gel, etch... smoke and dust, and lemme think who else, oh ya, heather would smell like pine shavings and pop-tarts and snow.  does snow have a smell? i think it does.   myself, i seem to smell the most like clean hair and dirty clothes. not really really dirty clothes, just ones that have been sitting on the floor for a while. i suppose if you sniff really close, i smell like cinnnamon toast, because of that soap i use and the fact that i kind of smell like toast also.   today in biology, which was at a weird time because of testing, we watched a movie about birds. the first bird was called Archeopteryx, and it was kinda scary looking. upon seeing said archeopteryx, Emine made a pointedly accurate observation, saying this thing looked like a "Turkey-Dragon". it was hilarious, and made even more so by the fact that the "thing" did look much like a cross between a turkey and a dragon.  today in guitar i learned lots of sutff. mr. beach gave me the tabs to "Maleguena" ((if you don't know it, it's the only peice of spanish guitar you ever hear in movie))((it's like den-den-den-den-den-de-do, den-den-den-de-doh-de-DUN)) but anyways, i picked it up pretty easily and i'm going to practice on it this week.   alrighty i think dbeedbeedbee that's all folks! i hope you enjoyed that detailed look into my smell system, and a couple ONOMATOPOEIAS((yeap, i speeled it right))  oh and i'm not doing a spellcheck on this post because of those lyrics, so don't think me a fool.

      THAT WHICH DOES NOT KILL YOU WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH ABOUT IT LATER.  so lets see... I haven't done anything this weekend.  Saturday Devon wasn't here, so I was extremely happy all day and I just piddled around. Saturday night that stupid little fucker came home, but luckily I didn't have to be around her much because I went to play bingo with my mom and my neighbor.  bingo is SO much fun! I didn't win, but maybe next time?   today has been... Okay. I woke up really early for some reason and sat on the couch and listened to it rain. My mom made shrimp salad sandwitches for lunch! Devon was supposed to have done all this stuff but she didn't so she got yelled at. So mom is still pissed off at Devon and Devon is still a little cluckfucker and I want to chop her into little pieces. She's particularly perturbed at me because she's regretting that little deal we made. Apparently dish duty doesn't suit her. So she's in a crappier mood than usual and so she's cleaning our room and she's throwing all my stuff in the hallway. It's really pissing me off and every time I go near her she's like "fuck you caitlin" and I'm really tired of it. I wish with all my heart that murder was legal.   I met a really cool guy playing pool. His name's Michael and he's a starving artist. You guys should go listen to some of his music.  urlLink  MyDreamRewrite    testing starts tomorrow. I need to remember to pack my cards, poker stash, books, CD player, and food. God, I hate it. I almost hate it more than Devon, but not quite.   1. My favorite feature on myself is my hair, eyebrows... Well pretty much my whole head. But anything from the neck down is ugliness. 2. I'm a traffic whore, I have like.. 5 counter things attached to my blog. 3. I hate it when people find out I skipped grades and act stupid about it and then wonder if they can talk to me without explaining stuff. Of course they can, how do they think I GOT to 10th grade?? 4. My favorite flower is a morning glory. 5. When I was younger, I loved making lists of everything. I recently found an  inventory of all my clothes from when I was 11. 6. These days, I don't write anything down unless it's really important, and if it is, then it gets written on my hand. 7. The only thing I lose all the time are guitar picks, and then I have to buy more and then I find them in weird places like in the dishwasher.  right now I have written on my hand: my gym locker combination, 3 assignments, a reminder about a quiz on the 21st, and a phone number I don't recognize.  spring break is only two weeks away. My uncle, aunt and two cousins are coming in from Ohio. I can't say as I am extremely happy about this. Even though I love them all, my cousins are terrible. I think they are 1 and 3, and the 3 year old is a freaking holy terror. To make matters worse, fucker((aka my sister)) will be on an art trip and I'll be babysitting the whole time.  in case I haven't mentioned it, I hate kids. I don't want to have kids, I don't want to be around kids, and I don't want to think about kids. The only time I will tolerate kids is when I babysit, but then again I'll do almost anything for money. I find drooling, snotty, whining, stupid, annoying, cranky and always hungry outweighs the occasional cuteness that comes with being around kids.   I'll be posting bunches this week since I won't have homework!

      THE WORLD IS MY LITTERBOX AND YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE THE SCOOPER  I figured out why the song of the day wouldn't work, I had the file extension thingy wrong. But I fixed it and it's all good now. I changed it to another one of my favorites.  Why do ducks have webbed feet? To stamp out fires. Why do elephants have flat feet? To stamp out burning ducks. ((cha))  today was.... Well it was pretty damned aggravating. We did standardized test practice in all my classes. Once again, I hate standardized test practice. I thought to myself "one more bubble, one more scan-tron, one more stupid question about the distance from the earth to the sun.. And I'll explode". Thankfully, I did not explode, I simply tried to ignore the fact that so many trees died so the teachers would have something to waste my time with. But I was in a good mood.   so a cow gets artificially inseminated and she goes back to the pasture and tells all her friends "hey guys, today I got artificially inseminated!" and they're like "seriously?!" and she's like "yeah, no bull". ((cha))((cha))  this morning on the way to school I argued with mom about going to dad's. She pretty said the same stuff and we didn't make any kind of progress, so I'll probably end up dropping the whole idea to, yes, avoid more confrontation.  tonight was Sadie Hawkins. I don't even feel a little bad about it because I HATE cafeteria dances. And besides, I know it's mainly for stupid freshman. For some reason, all the freshmen seem to fit into the same group depending on what year it is. Last year, we had freshmen who couldn't care less and did horribly, but this year we have gawky and brainy little freshmen who are constantly competing to see who can get the best grades. It's quite aggravating.   today I got lots of hugs. I can remember when someone would come up to me and I would almost cringe. But since I've gone to magnet and EVERYONE wants to squeeze me, I've come to love the friendly embrace and find it quite lovely. I find the atmosphere of my school to be so comfortable that it's like living in some kind of unisex, anything goes, everybody loves everybody else, we will still love you if you're a boy and you wanna kiss other boys, same for girls, you can worship the devil and still be a nice person kind of way. I absolutely love magnet, too bad it's a school where I'm forced to learn stuff and not just a big daycare for older kids. But really, I don't think there is another school like it out there.   I'm gonna fix up the layout tonight, I've been itching to play with it but I have no idea what to do. Suggestions?   aside from that, I'm going to play disgusting amounts of internet pool. I didn't bother making plans because all I could think about was sleeping.   as for the whole Devon will do the dishes and give me five bucks in exchange for doing her report, she made an A+ but has already started bitching about the conditions of the agreement. Luckily I wrote everything down and made her sign it. So tonight she was all like "noooo it starts on Sunday!" and "it was only 5 days not 7!". But mom backed me up and she got yelled at and it was funny.   to me, it's crazy how much stuff changes as you get older and how standards fluctuate so much. If I had handed that report in to my English teacher, I would have failed, but Devon made an A+?  I remembered a story about my algebra teacher. It was when mom was in the hospital with a staph infection((like rosie says, staph is no laugh)) and I went to the hospital everyday after school and talked to momma. Well I turned in a blank worksheet and I wrote a note of apology with my main reason for not doing it being that my mom was in the hospital. When I got the paper back there was a note scrawled on the side saying "sitting around at a hospital is a perfect place to do homework". I don't think I've ever been more offended. Of course I realize now that  bitch was right, but at the time I was so worried about momma I was sickened at her lack of sympathy. I remember writing her about 4 horribly long notes about how family was more important than school and how she was a mean old cow, but of course I tore them up and moved on with life.   I remember when I was little and I had a babysitter who gave me a bath and I was so nice and cozy after the bath I decided to hide in my mom's huge king size bed with millions of pillows. Well I fell asleep, of course, and the babysitter didn't know where I was and never thought to look under the pillows on the bed. So when I woke up my mom, the babysitter, and a police officer were standing in our foyer talking. I thought I had done something wrong so I went back and hid in the bed again. My mom says the policemen found me eventually, sleeping in the next room. I've always loved that story, and it's one of the few things I remember from when I lived in Texas.  1. I skipped second and fourth grade. 2. ^that makes me the youngest sophomore in caddo parish. 3. I hate the baz lurman version of Romeo and Juliet. 4. I love the zeffirelli version of Romeo and Juliet. 5. My favorite playwrite is MOLIERE. 6. I like to read books 2-3 times in case I missed something. 7. I read Island of the Blue Dolphins 9 times, it's one of my favorites.  btw if you haven't tried any MOLIERE, you should. I've read Tartuffe, The School for Husbands, and Misanthrope. And if you do decide to pick up a copy, don't freak out when it's written in rhyme. The way it's done makes it even funnier. I also love cyrano de bergerac, but it's so.... Overdone?    today I was feeling frisky so I walked a mile. While I was walking I had nothing to do so I talked to myself in French, simply making up words if there was one I didn't know. "J'aime marcher" "J'adore aller a une promenade au primtemps" "Ce jardin est moche" ((heather will have to correct my mistakes))   I love you all!

      INTERNAL CONFLICTS R US  it's times like these when i realize just how much i like this blog.  sorry for not posting the last day or so, nothing honestly worth talking about, save an idea i had and that i've been thinking about constantly.  it's tuesday. i think about how bored i am all the time and how nothing but flowing conversation seems to satisfy me, and the only bit of that that i get is with myself. i thought about how everything was so strange, it was like walking on eggshells that were destined to break, but treading lightly as to prolong the time before everything cracks. i thought about how on my scale, everything was stressful, and how i couldn't pinpoint what was wrong, so finding no plazable reason, i am simply happy, and how this is true with everyone. i get this crazy idea...  it's wednesday. mom leaves for New Orleans, i see a butterfly and start wishing for more butterflies. then i missed houston, then dallas, then maui, then i began missing everything i was missing. so that crazy idea stuck in my head, i would go live with daddy over the summer. i'm really no trouble... i take a lot of showers and i drink a lot of diet coke, nothing severe. i think it's a great idea. what a lovely way to relieve a little stress than to go hang with the daddio?! we would play tennis and watch movies and talk about politics and i would drink all his water because he drinks distilled water and it tastes better. besides that, i hardly know the guy. i can't even tell you what he does for a living! when people ask, i tell them "oil", and it seems to suffice.  it's wednesday afternoon, devon asks me to loan her some money for a school shirt thing, of course i do.  it's thursday morning, this morning. i get up and prance to the shower, having gotten a good 7 hours. devon screams at me because she says a shower will frizz her hair, so i have to wait,  regardless of the fact that there is a mirror and a vanity in our room. this pisses me off royaly and screws me up for most of the day. i feel like getting away from devon would be another good reason to be dad's kid for a summer. thursday afternoon rolls around, i'm feeling good, devon asks me to do a book report for her in exchange for money and chores, i say yes. we order pizza, mom gets home around 8 o' clock. after she's settled in i go in her room and sit and chat with her, everything is going good, her trip was nice. so i figure i might as well throw my idea out there. i casually ask her what she thought about me going to live with daddy for the summer. her knee-jerk reaction is to say that it would break her heart and she would hate me forever, but after rationalizing a bit, she says that it would hurt her feelings to know i would rather be with my dad than with her. when i try to explain my reasoning and how it's NOT her, she cuts me off with a foul "whatever". then devon launches into a little speech about how she knows that i want to get away from HER and how if i didn't have her, i would have nobody to tell on, nobody to blame, nobody to do the other chores, nobody to clean the room and nobody to whine to. mom backs her up by telling her that she is glad devon is wise enough to know that that's exactly how it would be. i begin feeling more stupid and getting more angry. after a few more derragatory remarks from the peanut gallery, i left, saying sarcastically "thanks for listening to my suggestion like a mature adult". they poke fun at the fact that i am leaving.   so then i came to the computer, trying to keep my heart from leaping out of my throat and wondering why my face is so hot.  is this really such a terrible thing? is visiting my FATHER for ONE summer and finally figuring out were the rest of my gene pool came from such a crime that i should be chastised, dare i say humiliated by my mothers refusal to to accept the idea?  i could turn the situation to my advantage((by some standards)). i could say that she would be so lost without me to babysit her that she would positively DIE if i wasn't here for a couple months.... but i don't think i'm that egotistical.  1. i wish i had a kitten 2. the first movie i remember seeing as a little kid was Phenomenon 3. Phenomenon is one of my absolute favorite movies 4. i hate the girl who does the GladWare commercials, and if i ruled the world, i would have her buried, dug up, and catapulted into the sun. 5. i would do almost anything to avoid unconstructive confrentation((i.e., anything that wasn't a formal debate on an actual subject)), which is why i tend to tear out of buildings/rooms where such might occur.

      LICKING ENVELOPES IS BAD FOR YOU, DAMPEN THEM WITH A WET SPONGE.  emily's birthday on Friday night was lots of fun, I met some cool people and learned a new card game and at cake and watched Nemo.  Saturday, I cleaned stuff and played internet pool.  Sunday I helped mom wax her car, cleaned my room, ate Mexican food((w00t)), and cleaned some other stuff. Then I stayed on the computer doing homework/playing pool until 2AM. Around then I went to my room and mom knocked on the wall. When I went to see what was going on she said she couldn't sleep because she hadn't made any chicken salad. So, sure enough, I was in the kitchen with her chopping pickles until 2:30 when I finally went to bed.   I got up at 6AM and took a nice shower. I enjoy showering in the mornings, it's just hard because Devon is still here and she's always trying to kill me. Seriously, I closed the door to get in the tub and I locked it and she freaked out and started banging on the door like crazy, which woke up mammaw. When I first got up I was super tired, but I had coffee and I've been stupendously energetic all day. It's kind of freaky, if you think about it, that I feel better on 3 1/2 hours than I do on my regular 6, but hey,  whatever works.   this week most of school will be about LEAP practice. The only thing I hate more than standardized test practice is standardized tests, and that's the truth.  I was supposed to have read "a tale of two cities" and watched a movie called "Catherine the great", I did neither and still made 100% on both reports. ((score))  I didn't get to see the Jesus movie, but I saw Mystic river on Friday. To me it was a good story, but the editing was terrible. There were so many long, empty pauses, all the dramaticism you'd think would go along with a long, empty pause was lost. If I had to rate it, I'd say it was a rentable movie, and I say that simply because you'll be glad you have the fast forward button for when the camera pans around the river for the 3rd time and plays some crappy soundtrack music. The acting was good too, I see why Sean Penn was nominated.  this morning in the car, mom yelled at me for saying that she was tipsy at my IEP meeting. The only reason I said this was because she normally wouldn't get so upset over a B and call a teacher a bitch whore C%^&, so maybe she was tired or pissed off or something, but I don't care now. This morning, however, I cared a lot. I decided that my blog had caused too many arguments and even if it kept me sane and I love it it's not worth it and that the stress I relieve by writing is sent back to me two-fold by all the negative feedback from the family. But I changed my mind, because I would die without blogging.   today mom was "really really tired", i.e., she was acting crazy. She was 40 minutes late picking me up from school and she made me miss guitar. The details aren't important, but it pissed me off. The only day of the week that she MUST be on time, and she's always always late. Last week it was Steven, the week before, she lied to me and said Mr. Beach had cancelled when he really hadn't, so that she could be with Steven. bluh.  on a happier note, we got some itty bitty bread, it's 1/4 the size of normal bread, and I love it. I had itty bitty sandwitches for lunch today, along with an apple. What is it about eating apples that makes me happy. Not after you eat, but the actual eating of them. Emily said it was the freshness, but I don't know. All I know is I'm going to eat more apples.  I'm going majorly stir crazy. I haven't been out of Shreveport since going to Houston last summer, and it's getting to me. I want to go out of town, and I don't even care where, as long as it doesn't resemble Shreveport and I get to stay in a hotel. I would like to go to L.A. more than anything else and I've been saying so for years. So of course mom is going and she's not taking me. I want to go to new York city, Dallas, St. Louis, Ohio, ANYWHERE. I think at this point I would even go to Mississippi! One thing I really wanna do is go back to the Houston museum's butterfly thingy, it was the best. Me being such an animal freak, all those butterflies flitting around and sitting on me and stuff was a super cool thing. Plus we had to leave early last time because we had a baby with us, so I didn't get my fill quite yet.  this week's songs of the days((LOL)) will be devoted to the Violent Femmes. I LOVE THEM. So get ready folks.   instead of writing my hundred things all at once, I'm going to have a couple on every post, then maybe I'll put them all together or something like that.   poor Martha Stewart was convicted. I don't exactly know how I feel about this.   !. Whales make me cry 2. Rice crispie treats are my favorite 3. I wish I had the skin right below my bottom lip pierced 4. The farthest I've been away from home is prince Edward island, Canada 5. I love Robert frost

      I WISH I HAD A MILKSHAKE  didn't want to ruin my blogging streak((wow caitlin, a whole 3 days))((shutup)) so this will be a shortie post.  today i had an IEP. it's just a parent/teacher conference for kids in the gifted program. mom was a little bit.... tipsy, so she got all upset when morehead told her i had a B. her and morehead got into a little spiff about how she doesn't grade creative writing objectively and morehead was all defensive and momma was all being a ((bother my babies and you die)) bitch, which was cool. so on the way hmoe mom said morehead was a bitch whore C%^& and that she was going to talk the schoolborad. i know she won't, but it was pretty cool at the time.  when we got home mom started drinking even more and she's been driving us nuts all day. it makes me sad. mammaw says i should talk to her, but it never works. she makes all kinds of promises and then breaks them like they didn't even exist. oh well.   i have a huge biology test tomorow. but then again, they're all huge. that stupid ms. blackwell only gives unit tests((thats 5 chapters)) and she doesn't give us enough time to study. we were still getting note for the gargantuine exam tomorow this morning!! excuse me, but that's definately not ok.   i also have another fucking holocaust thing to write, and it's going to take forever. i hate the holocaust, and i makes me wonder what kind of people could do that sort of thing. and then, maybe not so much the brutal aspect((brutal as it was)) but more the phycological aspect. if there are people out there that can form thought processes justifying this kind of thing, i would hope we can find them a nice looney bin to pull coups in. eh. bluh. yuck.  tomorow i am going to emily's birthday party. i don't know what to get her. i already mde her a scarf, so it will be a small little something. i think i will get her a movie giftcard since i'm going to see the jesus movie with her on saturday and we're gonna hang out at juri's afterwards((juri's...)). and don't even say a word about me going to see the jesus movie, it will be a cultural investment in how the people of the day interacted and lived. so there! plus mom said the devil was really scary and weird and i kinda wanna see it anyways so poo on you.  getting yelled at. must begin analysis of mass murder and cruelty. what a nice way to end my day, huh?  and sorry about not spell checking... and i only say that so you don't think i'm retarded and can't spell. the government isn't forcing me into public education for the majority of my life span so i can procrastinate homework by blogging and then not spell stuff right.

      "...I AM GOING TO WALK THE EARTH FOR A TIME"  why do such weird things stick in my head? Since tif mentioned the idea, I have longed to "walk the earth". I should think it would be quite fanciful to set out on my own, my wonderful trekkie bag at my hip, birkenstock sandals scuffing the ground, a very large sunhat keeping the freckles away, and my hair flying around trying to escape the confines of a small piece of twine holding it at the nape of my neck. I would roam the Italian countryside, a worn copy of "Shakespeare", "Utopia", and "Robert Frost" in one hand, and a sac of fresh proshcutto, crusty bread, and young wine in the other. In my trekkie bag I would carry a change of clothes, a journal, an umbrella, a camera, "The English to Italian Dictionary", "The English to French Dictionary", and lots of money. And also I would have a 5x7 of my cat and my big red sunglasses and my purse since I can't really do much without my purse and a cell phone in case I get lost and need to send in for a helicopter.  today, as most days are, was boring. I trudged through the muck to all my classes and the only fun thing was walking to the park with Sarah and Bess during gym class and playing on the spinny thingy and jumping off the swings. I walked through so much mud getting to and from the park I threw my socks away when I got back to school... I, being an idiot, wore open shoes, so every step was a little mudbath for my feet... ewww  since today was such an awful bore((aside from losing a pair of socks)) I daydreamed through all my classes. I thought about how I wish I had more friends that I could be myself around. As of yet, there are about....2. Now hold the phone, I do have more friends than that, I just don't feel as comfortable around them. Mainly because I'm worried about upsetting them and then them not being my friend anymore. yahta yahta this is not very interesting...  we watched Chocolat in French, it was gooood. Especially since Johnny dep was in it and it was food themed. ((hehe))  um um I don't have anything else to say I don't think.

      AND MY TITLE IS... I WILL NOW HAVE TITLES... IN CAPS  yeah, I know it doesn't really matter but I'm gonna have titles from now on. w00t  I'm much much better than I was this weekend, thanks for asking((bitches!))((kidding, kidding)).  ok so I didn't blog Sunday because I was busy watching the academy awards. I feel so stupid after I spend 6 hours listening to awards I could care less about diluted with endless acceptance speeches and tributes to Sidney portiers, but hey. Other than that Sunday was a bore, and all I did was procrastinate. But I was glad that whenever they were announcing an award I could say "lord of the rings?" and always be correct. Besides, LOTR did deserve it, those people worked their asses off.  procrastinate about what? A holocaust poem. Luckily I'm so poetically inclined((inept)) I was able to produce a masterpiece((master-piece of shit, that is)) in the four minutes I had left before school on Monday. I know the holocaust is important and stuff like that, but I hate((abhor))strongly dislike((can't stand)) writing about it. It's kind of like writing about September 11, everything that could be said has been said and then said again, making the whole process a bore and effectively losing the importance of the event by overly pursuing minor details.  speaking of Jewish people, I am completely sick of hearing about Mel gibbousness movie. Lately with all this Passion of the Christ/Ash Wednesday stuff, the topic of religion has been highly discussed and, in my case, highly avoided if possible. I do not believe in god, and I can't ever remember doing so. I can remember being dragged to Baptist church((by my grandmother I call Mimi)) and never really getting anything out of it. I can remember going to a private Christian school and kids telling me to accept god into my heart, and wondering if maybe there was something wrong with me when nothing happened. I can remember when my sister was baptized and people wondered why I wasn't getting baptized also. I can remember going on a catholic retreat with a friend of mine and finding the whole experience uncomfortable and quite fruitless. And  even when I was a small child and didn't know there were other things besides "god is good and atheists are going to hell"... Not only did I have no idea what an atheist was, I had no idea why I couldn't get god, so since I could form my own coherent opinions, I've had no organized religion to conform to. I've often wondered if maybe I am the same as all "Christians" that maybe they had "asked god into their hearts" and when they got no reply, instead of doing as I had and escaping the religion, had simply lied to conform the group. Or maybe they had been told of the sensation you have when you "get god" and after trying hard enough, had simply imagined the whole thing. I suppose I'll never know.   so what exactly do I believe? Unlike the average highschool student, I don't feel that we are souless, godless, and pointless creatures destined to die. One of the biggest points that I stand on is the fact that nobody knows exactly what happens after we die, and that makes every religion worth existing. From Christianity to Buddhism to bobism to Muslim, they all have equal chances of being the right answer, which is why I have respect for whatever path people choose and have a "don't try changing me and I won't try changing you" attitude. The path that I have chosen, however, is one without a "god" but a high level of spirituality. I believe that the spirit and the body are two defined elements that can exist without one another((some would call it dualism)) and that the spirit never dies. I belief that there are many planes the spirit can inhabit, and that as your spirit grows, it moves to new planes. I believe that until your spirit is ready to leave a certain plane, it will begin new lives and continue to compound it's knowledge until it can move on. So yes, I believe that we have all had past lives and the older your soul, the wiser you are. I believe in the flow of energy, and how anything can be manipulated if enough energy is put into it. So yes again, I believe you can heal, move things, affect the outcome of things, with your mind, if you try hard enough((which, I believe, is why praying is such a major staple in all religions, the more energy you put into something by "praying" the more likely it will turn out right)). I believe that some spirits may choose to wander in between planes before moving to another or beginning a new life. So yes, I believe in ghosts. And finally((since I'm sick of talking about it)) I believe that the barrier between the earth and the void((that is, the space in between planes)) can be entered while your spirit is still on earth and that your spirit can travel earth without killing the body. So yes, I believe in astral projection and meditation.  and what do I think about the bible??? I think most of it is not true. The easiest way to prove my point would be to ask "if all those things happened, you know, lepers being healed and being  swallowed by whales and such, why doesn't any of tit happen now?". now someone who had thought long and hard about it would say "but it does happen now! People are cured everyday and new and amazing things are happening" to which I would reply "yes, but all of those things have ways of being scientifically proved, whereas, last time I checked, "miraculously" is not a viable reason for someone to be cured and according to the bible it happened all the time back then" to which they would reply "well shi-ut".  the last few days have been fairly uneventful. I had guitar and he "taught" me how to read tabs. I guess he forgot that I told him I taught myself to read tab, so he was all amazed when he showed me the notes to the star spangled banner and I plucked it out perfectly. He gave me a website that's supposed to be chocked full of free tab and I'm going to check it out in a sec. But meanwhile I want a couple suggestions on songs from you guys that have good guitar licks in them and that I could get the music for.  ok that's it for now kids. Maybe another post later on? I'm in a bloggety blog mood.

      "...I'LL JUST CALL YOU MACHIAVELLI JUNIOR, YA FREAK."   my mom made beans and ham, one of my favorites. But instead of throwing away that tough outer layer of fat on the ham, she made... cracklins... And I... Ate one.  and the shock of the fact that I had just consumed pork fat fried in -pork fat- was so overwhelming I had to try it again just to be sure of what I had done.  eww!  It's been yet another one of those loverly emotionally overcharged weeks in which everything is a nice blur with just a tinge of green.  FLCL, Fury Cury, Foolly Coolly, wtf? I suppose I should start from the begining on this one: I enjoy the occasional anime. Wild looking characters, plots that are actual plots, and well, that nice zombie feeling you get when you flick one on the tell. Most of the time I stick with adult swim's inuyasha and cowboy bebop, but in a bout of boredom I turned on AS and they were running the first episode of -that show-... The show that is -so cool-, nobody even knows how to spell it. Is it sex? Is it drugs? Is it drug-induced sex? Can anybody tell me? The only way to put it is, well, FLCL. It's one of those shows that you think you can just put your brain into neutral and enjoy some mindless entertainment, but NO! It's like one of those freaky enlightenment things where when it's over you're like "that was so wrong, it must be god". But anyways, I searched for an explanation of the plot online and the only thing I found when searching for "FLCL explain" was "FLCL is impossible to explain" or "anyone who says they can explain FLCL is a dirty liar".   alright, I don't know why, but you must watch it. It's like snorting the canned air that you clean your keyboard with. Need a preview? Well lemme see: alien girl cracks young unsuspecting boy over the head with bass guitar and suddenly he's got stuff popping out of his head but it's ok cause he's the special one and then he's all Stockholm syndrome in love and then the girl flies away.  this week we decided to move the treadmill that was in the garage into our room. Seeing as it was buried under the massive pile of shit that WAS our house, I probably exercised more bringing it in the house than I will using it. However after several minutes of lifting, pulling, yanking, yelling, and a bitch-flavored commentary from mammaw along the way, we got it into our room and fully functioning.   being in that smelly garage full of my old life makes my heart ache. I had such a nice life. I had my own room, 3 beautiful cats that I loved more than anything, there was always king vitamin and yogurt in the house, and it seemed just perfect. To think of where I am now, smashed in between my mother and my sister, always feeling indebted to my grandmother who is more bitter than licorice and earwax sandwitches, this house is like one big happiness sucker. That's what I think about every day when I get off the bus and stare around at everything and wonder: will they be arguing today? Did I do or neglect to do something that has now got me in trouble? Is Devon here? Because I like it when Devon is over at valerie's when I get home.  the thing that bothers me the most is the way my mother treats my grandmother. I mean, we live in HER house, we use a bunch of HER stuff, doesn't SHE deserve some shred of gratitude? Maybe mom is too proud to be grateful, and it doesn't help that mammaw resents her every movement, but sooner or later won't they have to come to terms? Why do I worry about this bullshit?  it bothers me to think that this is where my life will be. This is where I will finish highschool, live during college, and be connected to for the rest of my life. When I look back on my younger years all I will see is the fact that WE lived with our grandmother,  and that the grandmother DID NOT live with US. This place, this hellhole, this house, will be the bulk of my memories. I may touch briefly on other things: cross lake, my old house, my exstepdad, Tyler, and smile a little, but then wipe the smile off my face and think "divorced, gone in the bankruptcy, dead, trucked off with Rick to Canada, or maybe just lost"  Thursday Devon got into serious trouble. She went on errands with some other kid and her mom but didn't call momma and stayed gone for like six hours. When she came home she was bawling and squaling and absolutely pitiful. So, of course, all mom did was ground her from the phone for the week((which isn't even being properly enforced)). Because Devon is so horribly distraught and unable to leave the bedroom I get stuck with her chores and get, well, bullied by momma who is so wrapped up in the daughter she was going to "kill" an hour ago.   so I'm sitting on the bathroom floor putting away this amazingly large amount of toilet paper and mammaw walks in and stands over me and it like "when you finish that you can sweep". Like I did something wrong!?! helloooo! This is the good kid! So what do I do? I stop wrestling the plastic wrap on the toilet paper and look in the mirror and  make the kicked puppy face((it's my favorite face to make because it indicates the deepest and most gut-wrenching angst)). Everything this happens, I almost instantly feel better because I think about Andrew and the canoe trip where we and a couple other kids were playing a card game and I made this face and he was like "don't give me those puppy dog eyes, you fat puppy", and I tried to act all -abashed-, but instead I burst out laughing. Since then I always bring that up when I'm around him and he turns a funny color and I just laugh some more.   I had a story to write for morehead, and I really didn't want to, but I did anyway. I turned it in feeling like it was one of the most retarded things I had ever put my name on, adjectives like abysmal and repugnant coming to mind. I went back to her room with Emily later on in the day and she exclaimed that it was a great story and that it was one of my best. If ever my mouth has hung open, it did right then. So since crazy English woman though it was super great I decided to put it on here. Hopefully everyone won't read it and dismiss me as a fop.   here is the story, love child of a late-night coffee break and procrastination at the final point in it's cycle, desperate urgency:  ÂWeÂre uh, gonna have to take you down to the stationÂ 	ÂBut I told you everything!Â 	ÂYes mÂam but we gotta follow procedure.Â 	ÂYou mean IÂm... You think I...Â 	ÂItÂs just a matter of coverinÂ all the bases and explorinÂ all the possibilities.Â 	But still, the idea of me, me the one who never does anything wrong? Who always leaves time on the parking meters and helps old ladies across the street? Well I suppose I never actually helped any old lady down the street, but if I saw one, I surely would! All these years of putting my faith in the goodness of humanity, all the karma IÂm going to lose over this! Just think! One minute IÂm doing fine and the next minute IÂm being taken downtown for robbing a Starbucks? And the worst part is I didnÂt even rob the stupid Starbucks! Starbucks has more of my money than I could ever steal from them in one trip! So IÂm just sitting around and talking to my cat and the policeman comes to the door and is looking for this Frappuccino money that I found in a nice box on my doorstep. He tells me that the station got a call that the money might be here and sure enough, he was right! I was going to turn the money in, I told him, but I was busy! Busy counting it, all $112 and a few cents worth, thirty-two cents, but whoÂs keeping up? Someone has set me up! But who? Who doesnÂt like me so much that they would actually rob a place and leave me with the money?  	ÂWeÂve really gotta get down to the station, missÂ 	ÂI know that! Just give me a second!Â 	ÂYou know, last I heard there was a witnessÂ account that the robber was a man, all we need is for you to sign some stuffÂ 	ÂSo IÂm really really not going to jail?Â 	ÂNopeÂ 	ÂThe big house?Â 	ÂNoÂ 	ÂSkid row?Â 	ÂAh ahÂ 	ÂThe last mile?Â 	ÂNO!Â 	ÂUp the river?Â 	ÂFor godÂs sake girl!Â 	ÂTo the loony bin?Â 	ÂNow THATÂS a possibilityÂ  hope you enjoyed this week's installment.

      EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT YOU I SLAP MY WRIST, BUT THEN IT'S LIKE, WHO WANTS TO DATE SOMEONE WITH NO WRISTS?  yeah, I know it's coming. The sickness! ((insert blood curdling 50's drive-in scream))  I can always tell when I'm getting sick, I guess it's one of those instinct things. glands are swollen, eyes are itchy, muscles are achy, a general feeling of nastiness has set in, and the desire to wear my pajamas 24/7 is at an all-time high. As strange as it sounds, I don't really mind being sick. The Raman noodles, the daytime television, the missing school, the rubber glove balloons from the doctor, the psychedelic cough medicine trips((oooh yaaa)), and the attention, gotta love the coddling.   so let's see, the virus has already invaded my system, so all I can do now is cut back on the liquids and never wear socks. ((am I seriously going to promote my own sickness just so I can not have to think about ANYTHING for a whole week?))   ((yup))  lately I have been overwhelmingly tired. tired like crazy tired. This morning I was in the middle of this dumb story in English and I kept blanking out and nearly whacking my head on the table, but being able to pull out of the dive for the highly polished "oak" just in time to look like a freak with a twitch. I did fall asleep sitting up a few times, in which I would dream a little, wake up and read a sentence, dream a little, wake up and read a sentence. kinda scary, but it made the story more interesting.  mom's out of town with stevie again and I know I'm repeating myself, but if I don't get out of Shreveport soon my eyes are gonna pop out, which is why I've decided to go see my daddy this weekend. I tried to see him last weekend but he sent my mom an email saying he couldn't afford it, then she lied and told me he had a wedding to go to. Mom should quit asking me to look at her email for her.  Mr. Beach taught me smoke on the water. Apparently it's not a single note and it's not a whole chord, it's a somethin somethin somethin and you just hit two strings. Either way it makes me feel very cool.  you know one of the most amusing things you can do near your computer besides changing the contrast of your monitor so everything is green is cleaning the keyboard! I love those cans of air that you use to blow the shit out, but around here we have this little brush thingy and you scrape it out. w00t!  54dddurfdwx   ^There's me cleaning the keyboard.. yay! LOL now my cat's trying to eat the little bitty brush thingy.  hope you guys will email me!

      NEW STUFF GOING ON  Due to a recent climb up "the ladder"((rickety and metaphorically shoddy though it may be)) I have decided to change my blog to a weekly installment. I find that lately I'm having to prioritize... a lot. So between school, homework, guitar, cat, chores, grooming((which, suprisingly enough, seems to require a fair amount of my time)), Sims and the occasional social outing, blogging has moved down my list of super necessary things.   So the good news is you only have to stop by once a week and the blog will now be less about my life in detail and more about stuff I think about((which is ok since my life is pretty boring anyways)). I do hope you all leave comments though, because I am the comment whore and I love the little notes I find lying around here.  I've noticed lately that the blogging community has slumped. People are writing less, reading less. All the energy has moved to the other side of the world. The balance is wrong, I don't feel level. Nothing seems to be happening, but it is, but we don't really notice, so it doesn't get acknowledged and it's soon forgotten. But then someone notices, someone who remembers to make notes, and then it gets written down, even if it has typos, BIG typos. And then everyone who ignored it while it was happening hears about it some years later and says "I was there". They weren't really there... They remember it like they remember being born, it positively happened but the details aren't really clear.  It's nice to see how far I've come since I started the blog. Things are easier to put into words, paper isn't wasted, there's no tinge of aggravation in me, I have two voices.  This week was good. creepily good.   Tuesday morning we pulled out of the driveway and drove about 15 feet before mom got a phone call from Steven. He pulled the "we need to talk" card. Of course mom flipped, made a u-turn and scrambled back to the house to take a bath and get beautiful for steven's little "talk" with her. mammaw had a dentist appointment so she couldn't take me to school, mom was busy primping, so I got to stay home! I chilled at the house all morning and contemplated surfing for some internet porn, but instead I played Sims and ate more peeps. When mom got home she wasn't a wreck as I would have expected, she just seemed a little aggravated and amused at the same time. It turns out steven's wife has been feeling neglected in the bedroom and he and mom are gonna have to hold off on the sex((which is kinda what they do all the time)) until stevey can uh... Get it up for his wife.   Tuesday night we went and ate fried catfish with our uncle mike who is not really our uncle but you get the idea. I happen to hate fried catfish, but I managed to choke down a whole bunch, and it made uncle mike smile, and that's all that matters.  Wednesday I made it to school for the first half of the day but mom came and got me in 3rd hour and we went and had lunch with Steven. We didn't really discuss anything important except for the play Steven was going to on Saturday night. When he noticed our interest he got us tickets too. It was called the "Forbidden Broadway" and it was parodies of all these famous songs.  On Friday I bitch-kilt on the tennis court and then played bingo all night long. I lost the stupid bingo, again. ((I should seriously consider switching to video poker))  Saturday mom and I had some bonding time. We shopped for hours and hours and then that night we went to the Forbidden Broadway. I looked sooo pretty! My hair was all curly and I had the camel pants and the wraparound black shirt thing going on. The show was absolutely hysterical, and it poked fun at everything from the lion king to les miserables. Mom and I had a great time sneaking peaks at Steven and his family and singing all the showtunes on the way home.   While I'm thinking about it, I would like to express my concern about the current fashion situation in the department stores. Ok... WTF?!? Who the hell is designing this shit!?!?  Since when are pineapple-laden cut-offs attractive? Why would anyone wear electric blue and fushia together? Do ALL the dresses have to have safari animals printed on them? And most importantly of all, how could they forget that lime green is a color only to be worn by LIMES! FROM LIME TREES! These clothes! It's crazy! I didn't realize that there were so many middle-aged Baptist PTA women who wanna dress in colors not found in nature printed with things that are ONLY found in nature all over them! Ugh.  Something I just realized a minute ago: I don't read blogs like I used to. All those blogs on the list directly to your left, I only read about half of them. The rest are sad little things, the product of over-zealous linking and laziness on my part. Tonight I think I will chunk all those retarded links and only keep the ones I actually read.

      YOU JUST ATE A HORNY PEEP!  Ah, the joys of Ishtar! For me the only thing that matters is the PEEPS. Everything else is just a ceremony announcing the return of the gooey sugar-coated goodness that is the Ishtar PEEP. Since it's the day after Ishtar the PEEPS were on sale for .50 cents so I bought 4 boxes((2 for me and 2 for Devon)) and began eating them all in rapid succession. However towards the end of my PEEP frenzy I stopped and decided to save a few of each color for microwaving later. Pretty soon I got sick of looking at them and Devon was playing PEEP soap operas so I grabbed a yellow bunny PEEP and a blue chick PEEP and rubbed them together and made green bunick((bunny+chick=bunick)) PEEPS. As Devon saw me doing this she started yelling PEEP PORN PEEP PORN. And I was laughing like crazy and when I finished making the PEEPS screw I popped one of them in my mouth. As soon as I did so Devon exclaimed "you just ate a horny PEEP!". I burst out laughing and could've died! We then continued discussing the idea of making PEEP movies, music((the Sex Peepstols!)), and other merchandise.   The only bad thing is... I laughed so hard this little piece of PEEP got stuck in my nose and well, let's just say they call me blue booger these days.  I meant to also save a few so I could have a peeper-nutter. What is a peeper-nutter you may ask? Well I'm sure most of us have heard of the fluffer-nutter, the oh-so-kitsch peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwitch. Well I decided I will be replacing the marshmallow cream with PEEPS and will have peeper-nutter sandwitches for lunch. ((other suggestions for names: fluffy-peeper, peepy-fluffer, nutty-peep, nothing we found was without SOME sexual undertone))

      ODE TO FLUFFY  although I did just partake in a large dose of The Nick and Jessica Variety Show I think I still maintain enough brain cells to write this... Maybe.  checked out of school on Thursday and went and ate the best crawfish I've ever eaten in my entire life, which is saying something since I've eaten quite a few. The whole eating-of-the-crawfish I find very... Carnal. Something about ripping in half and sucking the meat out of an animal makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. Since they were so good I had more for dinner that night and then more for dinner Friday night. W00t!  after the crawfish lunch we went to mimi's to finish work on her yard. Mom made me saw all the limbs off of the trees, which wouldn't have bothered me had I been wearing a helmet! Yeah, that's right! I went up to start sawing and the whole fucking limb fell on my head! Although it kinda hurt at the time, it's pretty funny now.  on Friday I didn't have to go to school. So what exactly did I do all day? I don't really remember. I know I played grotesque amounts of Sims((which is great by the way)) and then I errr...  Saturday is also an unimportant blur ASIDE FROM my dearest darling fluffy. Oh fluffy, how I miss thee! How, you, in short-lived glory, changed us all! My favorite squamate! Ok so here's the story: mom went over to beau's house and he had had a party and as a joke some of his friends put this snake in his bedroom and he was like freaking out so mom called me and was like what do we do and I was like get him to the light and she was like ok and then Saturday morning she brought the snake to the house and she said his name was fluffy and I was like he's not very fluffy and she was like I know it's irony and then we decided he was a Louisiana pine snake so we let him go in the woods and I was like noooo I love him and I wanna keep him and mom was like nooo he's a wild animal so I was like fine. So ends the story of fluffy, snake o' the woods and friend to us all.   so now it's Sunday, and believe me, I've got plenty to bitch about.   we can start with this morning. I was dragged out of bed, forced into nice clothes and soon we were on our way to... You know it's coming... CHURCH. BAPTIST NAZI HORRIBLE CHURCH! HOLY HELL!   before I launch into that, has anyone besides me ever kind of let their mind wander while they were listening to music and come up with really strange stuff? And then once you associate that image with that song you can't think about anything else when you hear that song? And then you tell someone else about it and they have the same image in their heads as you do when you hear that song? Today I was listening to Maroon 5 in the car and I was half asleep and all I saw was this lady in a wedding dress flying on  broom. And then I heard 7 nation army and all I could think about was alligators! And so then I asked mom about the song and she was like "all I ever think about when this comes on is alligators!" it was weird!  another thing I saw on the way to CHURCH((which was an hour away from the house)) was an actual church that had been turned into a gas station. I thought it was really... Odd.   so we get to CHURCH and it's just as fucked up as usual. All bleach blondes dressed like newscasters and everyone looking like they are watching a pleasant TV show, not really caring but not hating it. So first we sing, and sing and sing and sing and pray and pray and pray and then this preacher launches into this stupid sermon. Now I may have said this already but I'll say it again, if ANYBODY has the GOD thing wrong, it's the Baptist Nazis. Throughout his entire spew((which just happened to be accompanied by a brochure)) I felt like someone was trying to sell me a used car. The only thing I learned by wasting four hours of my life is that preachers talk in small circles and I just really hate that church. First he pissed me off by calling the Muslims ignorant, which is really sad and although I'm not a Muslim it was crappy of him to claim his religion superior to all the others and pitying their stupidity. Then the second thing he did was end his "sermon" by saying, and I quote, "even if you don't believe, you should come to church anyway and not risk going to hell"  perhaps I am being a hypocrite by bashing this particular religion, but when I'm dragged into that establishment by the hair, I will bash until their heads spin. How could anyone with any sense believe some of the bullshit that's in the bible?!?! I think all these people interpret the book as horribly as they can.   yes boys and girls, a man did get swallowed by a whale and then spit up! Cough/you're all going to hell/cough. fuck!  on the way home from CHURCH we passed a giant can of beer. It was funny.  once we escaped the religious crowd I took all my frustrations out on a box of peeps. I loooove peeps, I mean, really loooove them. So I spent the rest of the afternoon at uncle mike's house, I love uncle mike, he's the best.   "When you have a fat friend there's no such thing as a seesaw. Just a catapult." -Demitri Martin

      EASTER: IT'S TOTALLY PAGAN TOO!  This is an interesting little essay that I found and I think it's great. The real essay is actually longer and goes on to explain the pagan roots of Christmas, Halloween, valentine's day, and even groundhog day! So here's the shortened part of the essay about Easter, or Ishtar, as I should like to call it.    urlLink  READ THE ENTIRE ESSAY HERE    Easter is not a Christian name. It is Chaldean (Babylonian) in origin - the name Astarte, the queen of heaven. The name Astarte as found on the Assyrian monuments was Ishtar ((pronounced ÂEasterÂ)) We must remember that Ishtar of Babylon was the same goddess worshiped throughout the world under various names, such as the Egyptian fertility god, Artemis, the Roman goddess of licentiousness, Venus, the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite, and the Ephesian, many-breasted fertility god, Diana, as well as many others.  The (Easter) bunny, the oldest pagan symbol of fertility - Semiramis - has absolutely NOTHING to do with the birth of Christ. Sunrise services are for the worship of the Pagan Sun god - ONLY!  One mythological legend says that sometime after Semiramis died, a huge egg dropped from heaven. Out of the egg came a re-incarnated Semiramis, now a goddess. The Babylonian Talmud refers to her as Ishtar, or Easter.  The forty days of Lent symbolize one day for each year of Tammuz' life, the son of the pagan goddess Semiramis! This period of time is celebrated in the "Christian" church by giving up something to mourn the death --- of Tammuz!   "The hot cross buns of Good Friday and the dyed eggs of Easter Sunday figured in the Chaldean rites just as they do today. The Âbuns,' known by the identical name, were used in the worship of the queen of heaven, the goddess Ishtar, as early as the days of Cecrops, the founder of Athens, that is, 1500 years BEFORE the Christian era. One species of sacred bread which used to be offered to the gods was called ÂBoun.'Â The hot cross buns are not now offered, but eaten instead, on the festival of Easter (Astarte - Ishtar).  The ancient Druids bore an egg as the sacred emblem of their order. In the mysteries of Bacchus, as celebrated in Athens, one part of the nocturnal ceremony consisted in the consecration of an egg. The Hindu fables celebrate their mundane egg as of a golden color. In China, even as late as the 19th century, dyed or painted eggs were used during sacred festivals.

      IS VIOLENT PACIFIST AN OXYMORON?  shit what a week it's been.  so lemme see here... I guess I'll start with Sunday.  Sunday was boring but productive. Uncle Blake, aunt Kelly, Cameron and Conner left around 10AM and I spent the entire rest of the day cleaning. And when I say cleaning I mean CUH-LEAN-ING. I swept, mopped, washed, scrubbed, vacuumed, dusted, windexed, fluffed, fixed, wiped, and polished to a shining luster everything in this house. Although I was pretty pooped at the end of the day, I didn't care, I was so sick of sticky fingerprints and Mr. potatohead bits that I wanted it to be spotless. Plus there's always the added bonus of having everyone including mammaw in a fabulous mood. The only disturbing thing about Sunday was that I found out momma is making me go to church! a Baptist church no less! Holy fuck! I calmly and maturely told her that it conflicted with my own spiritual beliefs and that I would rather not attend, to which she replied "get over it, you're going".   Monday was... a blur. After staying up until 2AM cleaning my room and watching cartoons, I got up at 6AM and took a shower. The rest of the day I don't really remember, but Devon says I came home, wandered around, and went to bed at 8PM, which is something I haven't done since I was probably 10.   Tuesday... Ah... Had tons of energy, won my tennis match, and came home to find out that  I was being taken to a thing at church and then dinner with beau. The only reason we all went ((Devon, caitlin, mom, beau)), was to please Mimi, my step-grandmother who's got it in so good with -Jesus- she can't see straight, it was part one of Jesus' "story" where he saves the people and bla bla bla((don't think I don't know the whole thing by heart, I'm just not in the mood to go into it)) ((I like to know everything about something before I condemn it as a load of crap)). So through this entire little play, the four of us((excluding the holier than thou Mimi)) were giggling and commenting on the whole bullshit "sermon" that came after the production. Now I know I haven't been to church in a while... But aren't sermons supposed to sprinkle moral fiber and holiness on you? Well this, I don't know what you would call it... Was awful. a full hour of hearing some idiot tell these made up stories about people who were complete trash until they came to the church.. fuck a duck, these people need to figure out that all these pastors do is beg for tithes. It's sickening. He would read a verse from the bible, interpret it with another verse, then refer to the little white cards where you could give a donation and then join the church. What a stupid Baptist Nazi cult fucked up deal.   anyways, after that Jesus-flavored shitfest, we went to outback grill and I had some fabulous salmon and wonderful dinner conversation. Beau just finished writing a paper entitled "human consciousness as a variable in random events" it discussed experiments done at Princeton alluding to the fact that "wishing" "hoping" "praying" and all mental effort put into something will affect the outcome. Luckily he brought me a copy and it was fascinating. Then of course Mimi got involved, defending god and saying that god was responsible for everything good that happened. Beau replied with a well put speech on how this happens all the time but people make the mistake of forcing religious connotation, then went on to cite another experiment in which people had an incision made on their arm and then had their picture taken. Half of them were prayed over by Christians and wished well by atheists, while the other half were left alone. The half that had been prayed for and wished well by atheists and a collection of different religions had healed amazingly faster than those who were left alone. Mimi was dumbfounded so decided to launch into a spew about how the ladykillers had unnecessary profanity, to which we all cut her off in the quick, arguing that the character would not have been the same had he said "darn" and "fudge" and that without the profanity which was not overdone, the movie wouldn't have had the same feeling and it would have ruined the experience. Needless to say by the end of the meal she was pretty pissed off.   oh and something else cool that happened on Tuesday, mammaw decided to reward me for scrubbing the filthy house on Sunday by getting me a pedicure!!! Yah!!! So now I have soft silky feet and shiny red toes and I'm happy happy. mammaw has been totally cheesing on me lately, she bought me the Sims Bustin' Out for all the babysitting and it came in on Monday, and now with the pedicure I feel like I came out ahead in that deal.  so now it's Wednesday, I won another tennis match but I also got a sunburn. mammaw picked me up and we went to the hyundai place and she bought herself a new car!!! It's a mother-of-pearl colored XG-350 and it's gorgeous!!! She definitely deserved a new car too, she's been driving her Cadillac for 15 years now.   speaking of road rage, congratulations to Emily for getting her driver's license and a car!!! Woo!!! em, you've gotta take me driving!  alright then, I guess that's it except for one thing: I got my email address for yahoo and now I hope everyone will email me. It's RUCallingMeFat2@yahoo.com. my AIM is RUCallingMeFat2 and my msn is the same with @AOL the reason my AOL name doesn't work is because mammaw's in the process of deleting that godforsaken program and it's all messed up.  okey dokey, I MUST go study for my math test.   1. I always have a song or sound effect stuck in my head, it's a miracle I haven't gone nuts yet eh? 2. Right now I've got the yeah yeah yeah's "maps" stuck in there.  3. Yesterday it was usher's new song "yeah". Surprisingly enough, the song didn't bother me as much as "African American" music usually does. 4. I have developed a taste for green beans, something I used to hate. 5. Chewing gum gives me a headache.  Funny little something. Today in World History during our socratic seminar my friend was asking all the questions and was giving me easy ones to be nice. My final question was "is violent pacifist an oxymoron". We laughed and laughed, and I made a 100%

      THEY COULD ALWAYS STAY LONGER.. BUT THEN I WOULD HAVE TO KILL US ALL... NOT THAT I MIND, I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE FAIRLY MESSY.  well at the request of Tr0y and the neurons exploding in my head I have taken refuge in the office to blog. By taking said refuge, I have left the two toddlers alone watching Nemo in my room. By doing this, I am risking the lives of everyone involved and while nothing serious may take place, I can guarantee you that I will lose a couple knick-knacks.  and yet at this point, I would give all the knick-knacks in the world for a little peace and quiet.    I am spent. spent when I didn't have much to spend in the first place. This has been by far the worst spring break ever. I am tired, so tired, and sooo fucking aggravated. For the last five days these people have been scraping away at my reserve and have completely lost it. I have surrendered to the bloody wrath that is "the toddler" and I just can't handle anymore.  I was supposed to relax over the break. I was supposed to sleep.. a lot! But, ironically enough, I have slept less this week than I do in a normal school week. I stay up until midnight cleaning, chatting, trying to compose myself, then am awoken by the cacophony that is an impatient child. "daddy! Mommy! Get me out o' dis cri-ubb! waaaaah!"   SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU LITTLE MONSTERS!  while I don't consider myself a violent or short-tempered person, I have wanted to slap the shit out of this kid every single hour of every single day at every single whine or tantrum or screaming fit or, the worst one, when he completely ignores the yelling and does exactly what you told him not to do. Perhaps this wouldn't bother me so much.. But he always fucking gets away with it!!! How many times has he been in my closet ripping things out whilst we make ourselves hoarse trying to dissuade him. Then if he actually DOES get in trouble, the screaming crying whining goddamn tantrum that follows makes the whole effort hardly worth it.   I think I'm done bitching for now.. I mean, they are leaving tomorrow. I'm just counting down the seconds...  on a happier note, I had a great day on Friday. I had sunken into such a slump that I could barely stand up and it made my uncle feel bad, so he and my aunt took me out to lunch and then bowling. We had tons of fun, and the fact that we weren't within five hundred feet of the kids helped A LOT. After I got home from my outing with the family, we went and played bingo!!! Even though we sat in the smoking section and I was completely asphyxiated within the first hour, it was really really fun. And the best part is... I WON A DOLLAR!!! Yes, I caitlin, was the lucky winner of one dollar. I won it from these little ticket things that you rip the tabs off of and see if you got anything. But then, of course, I traded in the winners for 4 more tickets and got losers!!! Either way I enjoyed it.   today was alright... I babysat for a bit of the afternoon and made 17 bucks, not to mention I was babysitting for the kids across the street who actually behave on some level. Now I'm at home, "relaxing", listening to the kids get yelled at. They decided on monjuni's for dinner, which only took about 2 hours of debating. Just a couple more hours until Cameron goes to bed!!! I think I'll make it!  1. I hate children and have hated children for a long time.  2. My birthday is November 19 3. That makes me a Scorpio 4. While I do hate the little bastards, kids love me. I think it's the picking up by the legs and spinning around that they enjoy the most.  5. If I were going to have a kid((which I'm so fucking not)), I think I would them Mikhail.  hope you enjoyed today's installment, but probably not since all I did was bitch.

      eghk.  it's raining. Not that I mind the rain, it's just that if it wasn't raining, I would be swimming my life away. Ok, maybe I wouldn't. Maybe I am sick of this sunburned, straw-haired, makeup free, dry clothing free, chlorine flavored, rough skinned version of myself. I'm a Scorpio, how could I not enjoy the swimming? It's the disastrous effects of the pool I can't stand anymore. I guess the only other reason is because the filter has been off for like, three days for some weird reason, and it looks really green.  this morning as I was half awake, I had the most fabulous dream. shane came over to my house((my old house, not my grandmother's)) for dinner and we sat in the living room and talked. He told me that he had taken a job as a flamenco dancer to earn some extra cash. So then we danced around my house and we had on these crazy costumes and then I woke up. I miss him.  lately I've been thinking about mixed marriages/children. I was thinking about how eventually, the whole world will be one big super-race, a mixture of all the cultures. We will speak the same language, but different dialects depending on where we were originally from. It will be a sad place, where there is no true diversity, where mixing genetics will produce new diseases, set new standards of normalcy, beauty.   when you see a child with one black parent and one white, you can always tell. They are a new kind of different that the world hasn't really noticed yet. I feel bad when I see them being picked on. I feel bad when I think about how someday the "mixed" people will need their own revolution against prejudice.   sometime this year I watched a show about midget couples who have children and lead seminormal lives. What are they thinking by having children?!? They know the pain and suffering that goes along with being different, and they are selfish enough to bring a child into the world to endure the same? Why not adopt? Why not save a healthy orphan from a loveless childhood? Not all midgets turn out to be cute little people either! They are born with limb and spine deformities which inhibit them from living the way they want to. to think that people will do that sickens me. Of course, dear folks, I have nothing against midgets. I merely used them as an example to show this problem which, although it may seem small now, will eventually change the world. I am not a bigot either, I have no problems with any minorities, ect. But really, people, think about what you're doing BEFORE you do it.   if you are such a selfish asshole that you think you must procreate and have your OWN child regardless of how the child will turn out, be it their backgrounds and lives or anything medical, then you should really take a look at yourself.  thinking about adoption has got me thinking about gay marriages. Since I'm not gay, I guess I don't have that strong of an opinion, but for me, I think there's no reason why they shouldn't be allowed. I think that homosexuals are just normal people who have every right to get married whether it's for moral, financial, or religious reasons. I also feel that the adoption rate will go up with so many couples who are unable to have children for... Obvious reasons. The other side of that argument is that having gay parents will corrupt the children and make them all gay. That's a load of crap. Homosexuality is not a choice, it's the result of chemical abnormalities((for lack of a better word)) in the brain. End of story.  hmm... I wonder how many people I have offended with this post.

      well i would be at my dads, most likely doing something productive and enriching, but i am not. i am at my neighbors' house, wrapped in my neighbors' towel, eating my neighbors' string cheese, on my neighbors' computer. GAWD I LOVE HOUSESITTING! ((that's 'god' spelled with 'awd' as to indicate that it's not actually any religious deity, but rather an irremovable part of southern vocabulary)) living at someone else's house, especially someone with a pool, satellite, and an entire fridge full of coke in the garage, is the best thing ever, which is why i've decided to stay here in shreveport another week, until these folks come back from florida. it's positively wonderful staying here with just my mom and devon, without the toxic addition of mammaw, the chemical X in our salacious brew of a family.  when i think of myself, i never think of the fact that i'm a southerner. i don't have an accent, or a close relationship with any of my counsins, just the misfortune of living here in this swampy hellhole. i am by no means genteel, like miss   urlLink PAULA DEEN  , or then perhaps i would enjoy this fried chicken back porch hillbilly life style. i'm not fit for the south... i'm blonde haired, blue eyed, fair skinned, and prefer the cold.    urlLink TROY   finally got the code i made him. go look at him now that he's one of the beautiful blogger people.  in case you were wondering, that poem that i posted before this was inspired by my mother's toast.

      well it's finally here... finals.   today i took my first two finals of six, and after taking tests like those, you can't help but feel a little mooshy, wound down, decompressed. this morning, i knew everything about sohpomore biology, tonight, i can barely spell my name. tomorow i have gym and english, so i don't have to study tonight. on wednesday i have geometry and french. wish me luck.  as the summer and my long awaited trip to my dad's gets closer, i get more ancy. the more the prospect of being away from this house becomes a reality, the more excited i am, and the more i notice the imperfections and am glad to be getting away from them.  lately i've been feeling quite childish indeed. on saturday night, i went to a "study party". well, i didn't study, but i had fun. well at 3:45 i had woken up to pee and was snuggling back in bed when my mom came into my room and asked me what i knew about devon leaving. i was under the impression that devon was fast asleep in my mom's bed, but no. that idiot had snuck out of the house about 2 hours earlier and gone down the street to spend the night with her friend, a note on my mom's pillow the only trace of evidence she left. well my mom frantically called the neighbor, apologized profusely, and had devon sent home. that night, devon got into bed with my mom, and they slept. the next morning, she got a short and quiet lecture on why it was wrong and was sentanced to doing all the chores in the house for 3 days. well on sunday, she slept alllll day, so i had the chores and they said her punishment would start today. but today, devon got "sick". so what have i been doing???? being her slave is what! now she'll never get what WAS coming to her and i've been taking up her slack!   I'M GOING TO MY DAD'S AND THAT'S FINAL.  all i have to do is not explode until this weekend when i leave. i will miss my cat and guitar lessons, but not so much that i would want to stay in this hellhole town with these awful people.  i was thinking the other day when i was watching E! that i think they should pass a law saying that you can't get married unless you've known that person 2 years. it's crazy the number of people who know eachother for 3 weeks and then get divorced after 2 weeks. i should be the president...  speaking of president, kerry's going to win and that sucks. yeah, i'm a republican, and even though i don't like bush as a person, because he's well, a dumbo, he still represents my party. but he's too stupid and he's dug himself a big hole and kerry's going to win.   i thought this was just too good not to post. if you're republican, read it, if you're democrat, REALLY read it.  THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER  REPUBLICAN VERSION (or traditional version)  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.  Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed.  The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold.  DEMOCRAT VERSION (or the "new version)      The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.  Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.allowed to suffer so?  Then a representative of the NAGB (The National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with green bias, and the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism.  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings "It's Not Easy Being Green." Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers.      Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an mmediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share." Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act" retroactive to the beginning of the summer.  The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs.  Having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, the ant's home is confiscated by the government.   Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a Defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal hearing officers that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3PM.      The ant loses the case.  The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it.  The ant has disappeared in the snow.  And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of Democrats announcing that a new era of "fairness" has dawned.

      I wrote my paper, I stayed up until 5AM, only to drag myself out of bed at 7AM and bolger to school. As I disappointedly expected, morehead found a million problems. The only one I have a problem with is the fact that she didn't want long quotes in our papers. I wrote my paper an extra 2 pages long so that I could accommodate the quote, and it's extremely important to my paper. My entire thesis is based on how moliere's plays reflect his dislike of the 17th century French bourgeois and people of the time. Besides all of that, she didn't even fucking read the quote, she assumed I put it in there to take up space, and she's wrong. It's like cutting a huge hole in my glory of a report and I had to spend the last hour removing the quote and picking up the shambles of a once beautiful thing. Aside from everything else, it's a beautiful quote, which is why I put it on here.    this is from LE MISANTHROPE, which is about, you guessed it, a misanthrope who DISLIKES THE BOURGEOIS! Just like someone else who is extremely important in the life of this report! fuck morehead and her stupid rule.  No, no, this formula you'd have me follow,                                                                     However fashionable, is false and hollow,                                                                                       And I despise the frenzied operations                                                                                                    Of all those barterers of protestations,                                                                                              Those lavishers of meaningless embraces,                                                                                     Those mutterers of obliging commonplaces,                                                                                      Who court and flatter everyone on earth                                                                                            And praise the fool no less than the man of worth.

You know what i hate? i hate advertising. it's so annoying Especially these wildly invasive commercials that screech offers to you whilst a contradiction of what they say is at the bottom of the screen in tiny, almost but not quite unreadable prThe. the voices of these people((and maybe it's only becIuse i live in louisiana, the used car capital of the world)) are cacophony in it's purest form. they scream and yell and give me a headache. Unless it's Johnny Cash selling something, cause i like his voice. too bad about him dying and stuff.   ("Ring of Fire" to sell Preperation H, eh?)

      MOLIERE'S GOT NOTHIN' ON THE CASTLE GAME  someday, when you are 40 and I am 38, we will meet in a bar at the airport and I will recognize you. you will be bald and I will have had lyposuction and my hair will still be blonde. You've been married, divorced, I've been in New York City, taking advantage of the nervous economy. You are flying to Paris to sign a book deal, I am going there on holiday. We'll find nice people who will let us switch seats so we can sit together. We'll talk about the world and make obscure references to political mishaps, and you will make puns. Even though you still can't remember who I am, we'll have a nice conversation and I'll help you get your luggage since you don't speak any French.  at the moment, my the center of my ponderings has been around a certain group of gentlemen which I seem to have fallen in lo0o0ove with. It was just the other day when I realized I had a crush on just about everyone, and felt the need to break it into nice chunks. I love Jonathan, he's funny and musical and oozes charisma, I love a certain someone else, who's intelligent and thoughtful and has red hair. Well just yesterday I met someone else. This guy's name is Jonathan AND he has red hair AND he seems to posses all the qualities I look for in a person AND I talked to him for six hours until 4 this morning. So is this mixture of my two other loves the perfect one for me?   I have no fucking idea!  this week((from Tuesday afternoon and on)) has been fairly uneventful, which is why I won't bother to mention it.  I am becoming increasingly excited about going to live with my dad this summer. I would be making money, and most importantly I would be away from these crazy people in Shreveport. Just this afternoon Devon was bitching at me and when she finally stopped, I simply replied with "I'm going to daddy's". Neither mom nor Devon knew quite what to say. But that doesn't matter, what matters is that Devon is a bastard, mom is insane, and I will miss mammaw and my cat, but can work through that right quick.  this weekend I have a metric ton of homework to do. I have to write 20 pages of notes, write a six page paper, write a book report, and write a film report. Have I started on any of these? Nope! I got the cliffnotes for the book and watched the movie, but everything else I will have to do tonight and tomorrow.   I won't be going to school tomorrow because I have an eye appointment. I got afternoon migraines all last week, so hopefully my prescription has changed and it's not something worse.  I'm gonna take a sec to scream at the top of my lungs that NOBODY HAS BEEN BLOGGING LATELY AND IT'S TOTALLY PISSING ME OFF. That's all I have to say about that.  I think from now on I'll be one of those people who blogs paragraphs of little tidbits like all the time instead of big long weekly things.

      ROTTEN EGGS  Today, or tonight, or the time between midnight and 4AM when you're not sure if it is today or yesterday or if you've slipped into a crack between time and space and are destined to maintain a confused stupor until you shrivel, I feel quite bluh.  perhaps it is this huge piece of corn chip lodged in my mouth that makes me so melancholy. It's true, I tell you, I was eating a crispy taco even though I actually only like soft taco and suddenly a jolt of pain like none other rocketed up the tiny space between my front teeth and into my skull. Now the gum is swollen, the chip fragment is stuck, and there's a dull ache between my two front teeth that is more aggravating than it is painful. You see folks, it's this kind of shit that will send me to the nut house.  I am always wondering if I will become insane when I get older. They say people like me with high IQs develop multiple personalities in an attempt to distribute their unbelievable intelligence, they say people like me with all this childhood trauma turn out to be murderers who take the lives of others trying to fill an empty space.   there have been times when I think I've teetered on the edge, had that feeling where I am so overwhelmed I seem to lose sense and begin rocking. rocking back and forth aimlessly is something I think I've always done when I'm upset. For some reason it's quite soothing. If you've ever had a hard day, I would suggest a couple hours of this to chill out.   Monday was quite upsetting, and there seems to be a pattern there. I got my GEE, which is the graduate exit exam, back from school. I hate standardized tests, and although I've never done bad on one, they offend me. Well back to the point, I got the GEE back and made mastery, which is good. Mom picked me up from school at 3:30 and I went to guitar, then I walked to the restaurant near my lessons and sat in an empty dining room alone for a few hours while mom and Steven "talked" in the bar type area. Finally at seven we were on our way home with take-out and I remembered to tell her about the test.   when I told her, I lit a fuse, a long fuse. She yelled at me the entire way home. She said I didn't tell her about the test results until now because I was a liar and a manipulator, she said she had let me mother myself for too long and that I had stepped over the line, she said she was going to be a real mother from now on, and that I would be a real kid and not have the freedom I have now. I tried my best to reason with her, but was having trouble because not only would she not shut up, but I was in a state of shock over the absurdity of the matter. I told her that I had simply forgotten about the test, and asked her why she was so upset that I had only not told her for like, 5 hours. I told her that I had not known for a week or a month, I had known about the little fucker test since that morning. She told me that if I couldn't remember something like that then I should get my priorities straight and that I had waited to tell her so I could manipulate her.   as soon as I was in the house, I crashed and burned. I wept over the thought, choked on confusion, and even as I'm writing this it gives me goosebumps. I stayed in the bathroom in the back of the house for a long time. in a fit of anguish I drained half a bottle of my grandmother's prescription cough syrup, and I layed in the bathtub while the medicine knumbed me. I remember my silly wandering thoughts, thinking the empty bathtub was quite comfortable, and smiling at the wallpaper.  once the buzz had worn off I crept into the livingroom and crammed down some spaghetti. I found out that mom had told the entire story to my grandmother and sister, and that they also thought she had lost it. It's one of the few times in my life that Devon has stood up for me, and it was... Well she swaggered out of her bedroom, soaking up the glory of her "defeat" and making some obscure reference to our falling out. I apologized for the second time that night, but what it got me was another screaming fit, with myself on the not-so-cushy receiving end.   again, I  broke down, again, I made a beeline for the bathroom, leaving Olive Garden containers strewn about. This time I didn't stay so long, only long enough to make sure mom was asleep in bed before I left.      the last and final flailing I got occurred the next morning on the way to school. I apologized for the third time and when she still didn't really accept and had a small blow up. at that point, I just gave up. I was so completely inebriated by anger, hers and mine, I couldn't do anything but suck it up and make my way to English class.  I hate not understanding things.

      LIZARD GUTS  I've been sitting on the porch listening to mammaw and mom fight on the phone. Mom won't be coming home tonight, mother's day has been ruined for the both of them, yet they still argue. I just sat there soaking it up, not sure how anyone could fight over dinner like that and thanking myself for being the type of person who would rather be slapped in the face than fight with someone I love. I watched this lizard crawl across the brick and stop. He fanned out his coral colored neck and bobbed his head up and down, hoping his performance in pink will be enough to attract a mate. I wish life was as simple as the lizards', that all I had to do were follow my instincts and hope for the best, that i could expect certain things. But people are not like lizards, we have forgotten how to follow our instincts and that they're always right. We run willy-nilly all over the place, unsure of what we'll do next and truly, not worried about it or what we hurt in the process. We don't do what's right, nobody agrees on anything, we are worse than animals.   We simply cannot live.  Happy goddamn Mother's Day.

      OH, OH SWEET CHILD O' MINE  well as far as bittersweet weeks go, I think this one takes the cake.  after an exasperatingly stupid fight with mammaw: mom: "I'm drinking!" cait: "you're drinking, I'm eating, mammaw's bitching, and devon's being a bastard. It's just another day in paradise."  I always know how to make her laugh.   I suppose I can start with the kitten story. Sunday night((right after I had written the last post)), my mom came home with a kitten and told mammaw she found it near a dumpster behind expo hall. I was ecstatic, but not too much so, as mammaw was not supposed to know that the kitten actually came from some lady's house. So then I had a cat, a little cat, and I made sure it was all happy. By Tuesday I was well on my way to convincing mammaw to let me keep the "stray" kitten.. Or so I thought. Tuesday morning during third hour mom called me and simply said "mammaw reads your blog, she knows about the cat, we're busted, and I'm going out of town." after a few good hours of reeling over the fact that she knew about the cat thing AND that she's been reading this blog for the WHOLE time, I slinked into the house and then proceeded to have a screaming fight with mammaw which ended in me blubbering about the cat and mammaw immediately relenting and letting me keep it. Well what I haven't mentioned yet is that the cat is ugly, loud, annoying, and max((my other cat and the apple of my eye)) hates the little bastard. So we finally decided that we were going to find a god home for the first cat and get me another one that was calmer and that was a girl so max would like it.  HOW DARE mammaw read my blog? Huh?!?!? I asked her nicely to not look for ways to read it and I trusted her good will that she would keep her ass out of my bushiness and let me have that one shred of privacy that I need to keep from going insane. I should have known she was a horrible nosy control freak liar. This is why there is now a password block on here, so I am absolutely positively sure nobody but who I want to look is looking.    Wednesday, after they had a fight, mom decided she was going to dump Steven. This will be the third time she has chosen to free herself of that pansy and the third time she has failed. So all day Wednesday she literally wailed and puked for no reason. By Thursday they were a happy couple again.    Thursday afternoon I came home and found out that they had already given the cat to an old woman who had called about the ad we put in the paper. I was kind of upset that they had given it away before I even told him bye, but I didn't have a chance to worry about that since Steven was picking us up to go mother's day shopping. We ended up getting her books and bubble bath, which is what we have given her for every holiday since I can remember, and which I disagree with since I think she spends enough time in the tub reading anyway. Oh well.  Friday night Emily called me and invited me to the movies to see 13 Going on 30, which I have already seen and hated it the first time. Yet after a few seconds of cajoling I decided to go at which time Emily told me that it started in 15 freaking minutes. So I didn't go because I knew I wouldn't be able to make it in time and that movie was stupid the first go around.   now it's Saturday, the day before mother's day. Presents have been wrapped, plans have been made, and arguments about every detail have ensued. mammaw is pissed about the fact that mom wanted to get her lobster and steak as her gift, arguing that "that was something everyone would enjoy and she wants something just for her" ((that's a direct quote)). Now, is it just me, or is that totally fucked up? My mother was going to prepare a lovely meal for her and the fact that we were going to partake in said meal and share a happy family moment was just a side note. But noooo! I suppose she would like to eat surf and turf while we hide in the corner? Would THAT be JUST for HER? So her and mom have been fighting all morning, and on mother's day weekend no less. Mom went and got her something that would be only here's and then went over to mimi's house to give her a gift. Mimi is my ex-step-grandmother.   I finally solidified the plans for me to go to daddy's all summer. I will stay there and possibly come back for the weekends. During the week I'll get to hang out with daddy and get paid to help mompat((dad's mom)) organize her business. Daddy told me that I saved her ass last year because I fixed the mistakes in her income taxes and then remembered to make two backup disks.   I'm tired of mom and mammaw's fighting. It's every single fucking day and it's always over something stupid. I am sick of being their punching bags((not literally of course)) after they have these arguments. I am sick of always being the one who listens to mammaw bitching and makes mom feel better when she "breaks up" with Steven. I am sick of being the live-in psychologist and the only person who wants this "family" to stay intact. I am sick of being the strong person, the shoulder to cry on, the one who will always cover for you, and the one who never minds doing you favors like bringing you water every night or coming when you call or washing your sheets or doing your homework or taking your chores so you can go to pool parties or letting you smoke in the house or letting you drink in the house or keeping mom and mammaw apart when they argue or mediating or worrying about things that most people my age don't even know exists.   this is why I'm going to live with my dad this summer, because I just can't take it any more, and because I feel so unappreciated. Maybe without me here they can do their own chores and maybe without me here they will just kill each other. They will never work through their problems with me always pacifying them and solving the problems. It's just not my fucking job.  that's my piece and now I've said it.  there is something else that I thought wasn't a big deal but then realized that if I have to put off writing it in my blog then it must be. I've been struggling with putting it in black and white, but I think it's something I ought to do. When we lived in the apartments we had a neighbor that we called Mr. Jean. Mr. Jean was a nice guy, and he was always bringing us little presents. Well mom would let us stay at Mr. Jean's house sometimes so she could run errands and we almost always went to the pool. Every time we were with him he would.. Touch us. He did it all the time and since I was so young I had no idea it was wrong. I can remember him sticking his hands in my bathing suit and watching him do the same to Devon. It never got worse than touching, and I know I'm lucky.  that was hard to type, but I think I will feel better later.   I found out later he was put in jail for doing the same thing to his step-son.  that sick fucker. I hope he rots away getting ass-fucked by all the other inmates.

      There's no home for you here girl, go away There's no home for you here  I'd like to think that all of this constant interaction Is just the kind of make you drive yourself away Each simple gesture done by me is counteracted And leaves me standing here with nothing else to say  Completely baffled by a backward indication That an inspired word will come across your tongue Hands moving upward to propel the situation Have simply halted And now the conversation's done  There's no home for you here girl, go away There's no home for you here  I'm only waiting for the proper time to tell you That it's impossible to get along with you It's hard to look you in the face when we are talking So it helps to have a mirror in the room  I've not been really looking forward to the performance But there's my cue and there's a question on your face Fortunately I have come across an answer Which is go away And do not leave a trace  There's no home for you here girl, go away There's no home for you here  Waking up for breakfast Burning matches Talking quickly Breaking baubles Throwing garbage Drinking soda Looking happy Taking pictures So completely stupid Just go away  There's no home for you here girl, go away There's no home for you here  wow, it's been quite a while since I scraped up the nerve to bloggety blog, but it's not like I've had a whole lot of persuasive energy flowing around the internet. ((not to mention the fact that road runner has been down lately)). Nobody seems to be blogging, anywhere. Every day I go down a list of blogs in my favorites, and for the past couple days it's been completely dead. Maybe people have stuff to do, I sure as hell don't.  this week was kind of like throwup. You know, a little bit of everything all mixed together and then it leaves a big stain on the carpet. throwup seems to be an analogy you find a lot on blogs these days. The spewing of emotional vomit as one would call it. The same with the word "rambling" and "random" and "my life". This is why my blog had to have a unique title, and I think it's why people are tempted to visit when they see the link.   the biggest issue right now would be the reading of the blog by the mother. Because of my last couple posts, she's been freaking out and trying to fix everything, which is working out great but is still a little weird since she's always quoting me and talking to me about whatever I was whining about on that particular day. Yesterday she  said she was going to let me decorate the room I share with shitmunch any way I wanted because I had written that I missed my old room. She also came home from the grocery store with yogurt the other day, remarking that they were out of king vitamin((see previous post if you don't understand the significance of king vitamin and yogurt)). She's been just kind of weird and paranoid, worried that I will snap at any second.  mom said she would consider my moving to France as an exchange student in France. I would live with her friend Pierre((who she's been to visit)) and would stay there for my junior year. I told her I would do it without having to think for one second, and that's the truth. I have no attachments to anything here, no person or thing or place that I would miss. I hate this town, it's disgusting and full of horrible people with no aspirations or desire to live, we all just skulk by, waiting for the next bump in the road so we can trudge over and then bitch about it later.  the last thing she promised me was a kitten. I think if someone brought me a kitten and said I could keep it I'd just die of happiness. I love cats, I love the cat I have now, and I can tell that he needs companionship. I was so upset when we gave away mei-ling and merlot I just didn't know what to do, and I can tell that max((my cat)) misses having other cats to keep him company. Mom said that some time within the next couple days she would bring one home, claiming it was a stray, and that she would convince mammaw to let me keep it.   under other circumstances I would feel bad because cats are bad for my grandmother's breathing, but seeing as she has started smoking like a chimney, like 3 chimneys, a little cat dander won't even begin to do as much damage.   the very last thing mom did for me was to tell mammaw that they weren't going to fight in front of me. Well that one didn't last for long. This morning mammaw said something snotty and they got into a screaming, howling, screeching argument about the fact that mom had had a drink. Well mom had had a drink because Devon was being a little bitch and even though mom has been driving her downtown for three days so she could go to an art convention, she's still got the nerve to be a bastard. So mom wanted to slice her in little pieces but instead she popped her on the butt. Well you see, at my house, we only get spankings if it's something severely severe. in my life, I've never had a spanking, and devon's had like 4. So mom was crazy upset that she had "beaten her child"((oh puh-leaze)) and mammaw just couldn't leave it alone. So as soon as they started the fighting I slipped on my shoes and started walking down the street. a few minutes later mom chased me down and we walked while she boo-hooed about everything.   she said she felt bad for fighting in front of me but mammaw was the one who started it and I told her that mammaw is the type of person who thrives on arguments and that she shouldn't buy into them. I told her that what bothered me the most are the asinine things that they argue about and that if they wanted to debate about politics in the livingroom then it was fine but they were NOT going to screech at each other like baboons over something stupid like 4 oz. Of scotch or a cigarette. I told her that she should consider the subject matter before she engages in conflict, considering how little it will affect the outcome of anything it happens to involve. I think she listened.   lately Devon has been a super bitch and everyone is noticing. She is ALWAYS in a bad mood, she never has anything nice to say, and she end ALL of her sentences with "uh". ((noooooouh! yesssssssuh! leave me aloooooonuh!)). She is a bitch, nobody wants to be around her, and we're all practically afraid of her.   on Friday night I went to coffee house, which is a fundraiser for the gifted and talented program where everyone comes and eats while people in gateway((GT program)) perform. It was a really great show. My friend Edward played his fiddle((which he's been playing for eleven years, so you know he was amazing)) and my other friend tubbs wrote a blues song and sang it while he played guitar and harmonica. tubbs' song was definitely my favorite.  for some reason I have been crazy tired all weekend. I keep sleeping and sleeping for no reason. I slept 12 hours Friday night, had a three hour nap Saturday, and slept 9 hours last night.   I have one of those feelings in my stomach, you know, kind of sick-like, but more premonitory. I think everyone's got that feeling. I hope something more exciting happens next week.  by the way, is there ANYONE who can hear the music playing when they visit my site?

       ...For that he was a spirit too delicate   To act their earthly and abhorr'd commands   Refusing their grand hests, they did confine him   By help of their most potent ministers   And in their most unmitigable rage,   Into a cloven pine; within which rift   Imprisoned, he didst painfully remain.  -Shakespeare  I only realized a second ago that I haven't posted anything worth reading in quite a while.   Last night Devon had a sleep over. 3 kids, Lauren, and me... Needless to say it was horrible. One kid didn't get off the computer until 5am, one kid kept singing "r-e-d red r-e-d red, I can spell red", and one kid kept gluing herself to things. The 3 of them and Lauren ate an entire package of sugar substitute tablets by crushing them and snorting them up their damn noses. Then Lauren called tad who is ty's brother and Valerie loves ty and Lauren told tad and wtf who fucking cares girlies?  I woke up this afternoon to a peturbed mammaw and everyone else had gone. mammaw was pissed because "somebody had taken her sugar tablets and she didn't have any for coffee" well in the most non-incriminating way possible I told her Devon and her friends had been eating them. But when she asked Devon, Devon LIED and everyone covered for her. Well of course mammaw believed me and pretty soon mom and mammaw were arguing about how Devon can get by with ANYTHING because she is the baby is in the house but she is actually a lying little bitch, which led to an argument about how momma is a crazy bitch because of the way mammaw raised her, and how mammaw can't take it anymore, and how everything sucks. Momma stormed out, came back with a new pack of sugar tablets, then left again and has not been back.   Fuck I hate their arguing.  I have a photo of daddy and momma together... They're at my mimics house and they're... Happy. It's my favorite picture in the whole world. It's that one second in time when life was good, frozen, with everything after a clusterfuck. Daddy is handsome and mom is lovely and they're smiling. I looked at the picture for a while today and noticed it has candlewax on it, which pisses me off.  Mom said daddy would call me at 7 o' clock to talk about me coming over for a while. At 8:45 he rang in and launched into a rant about how boring his job was and how stuff wouldn't always be like this and how mompat was doing better and was going on an all vegetarian diet.  I decided something today... I'm a bad egg. I think most of the influences in my life are horrible ones and even though I don't realize they are attacking my brain and when I grow up I will be a horrible person. 2 divorces, 1 addiction, constant fighting, a mistress, and a partridge in a pear tree((goddamn that bird)). All of this goes on... And nobody tells me it's wrong. What am I supposed to think? I know it's wrong, but I ignore it because they're the only family I've got, and it eats me alive.  Having many many small talents makes a much more interesting person than someone with just a few big talents. If you think about it... Mosaics are more beautiful if they have smaller pieces.

      It's late, or early, or something, but I must do a spotlight now.  although I generally don't go for blogs with just one theme, when the theme is fabulous music, I must rejoice.  urlLink Musical Discoveries and Sonic Experiences  is this really great blog that's all about reviewing bands. When the latest post was loving on Metric, how could I refuse. And the post below it... The Yeah Yeah Yeahs. tr0y, you're gonna love this one too. I haven't really delved into the archives, but I'm planning on it.

      today i had the overwhelming urge to go to a museum. most unfortunately, the closest one is in houston. this is why i hate this goddamn town so fucking much. it is a shithole where nothing directly affects the universe and any notion of sensibility is lost on the alligators. where  urlLink POTHOLE PATROL  takes precedence over other news because there IS no other news. the television and internet are the most popular forms of entertainment because watching people live thier lives in real cities with a real sense of necessity is like wishful thinking for the lazy of mind. THERE IS NOTHING! WE-HAVE-NOTHING! it is so hot and humid, paper airplanes won't fly, but not that it matters, because people can't go outside for fear of contracting some goddamned mosquito virus. "WELCOME TO LOUISIANA. THE ONLY STATE WHERE THE GATORS ARE SCARY, BUT THE SKEETERS ARE SCARIER". i swear to gawd, i hate this town so much i want to burn it down and turn it back into a swamp, because that's all it is... a swamp with a super wal-mart built on it.  ::huffs and puffs for a few minutes::

      Before we begin today I would just like to bring something to everyone's attention:  urlLink THIS  is total bullshit. Goddamn  quogs. This dude has never written a thing in their life! They just take quiz after quiz after quiz!  went bowling with tiffany, allie, Christy, and Brandon. It was fun. I won second place with a whopping 67 points.   although summer is quite nice, it is also quite awful. There is positively nothing to do except eat, which I will not be doing, or exercise, which I am sick of doing.   Lauren invited me to spend the night---I need a good excuse to stay home. I have to wash my hair? I'm expecting a telegram?  I suppose I'll start another necklace then..   by the way.. Do you we like the audio blogger??? Because I think it's really nifty.

      Perhaps the saddest part of my day is when I finish scrolling down the list of blogs in my favorites and realize I've got nothing to do but sift through  urlLink quogs  and  urlLink blogs in arabic  for good reading material. I love blogs. Speaking of which, I think I'll sell tee shirts that say "I Love Blogs". It will make the internet freak wearing it feel special because everyone will ask them "what is a blog?" and they will get to explain.   today was nice. I went and saw shrek 2 and ate Mexican food avec muh peeps. As soon I was in the house, mamaw invited me to bingo, so I threw another $15 down the drain, and now I'm finally home, sick of people, and glad to be alone.  I better get over my antisocialness quick though, cause tiffy invited me to bowling with her and some other folks.   I haven't talked to Johnny john in a looong time, I think I'll call him. waaaaah.  when I'm busy doing stuff like this.. Movies, bowling, lunching, I have no time to think. It is annoying. I must think now.  shrek by the way... Awesome. It was sooo cute! I cried at the end.  lately I've been obsessed with the distillers. If any of you out there have the privilege of kazaa and haven't been arrested yet, I would recommend them highly.  it's not the things we do, it's the things we aspire to do, that makes us the people, the dreamers, the poetic couch potatoes.

      The phrase bats in the belfry is an Americanism dating to 1899. This phrase is the source of the sense of bats or batty meaning eccentric or insane, which both appear in the first decade of the 20th century. A belfry is a likely place to find bats and the phrase is simply a jocular expression similar to not playing with a full deck or his elevator does not run all the way to the top. In this case the belfry represents the head and brain and bats were chosen for alliterative purposes and because the creatures can be found there.  I've got bats in my belfry... Sounds like a code phrase for some horrible STD. I started wondering about this around 2 this morning when I heard noises coming from the fireplace in the living room.   did you ever think about the cave man-esque simplicity of the word fireplace? It's like fireplace-a place for fire. Vote that we change this to something more complicated to fit our complicated lives. pyrort((Greek 'pyro' "fire" German 'ort' "place")), or branndehouder((Norwegian 'brann' "fire" and Dutch 'de houder' "holder of")), or Flamlar ((German 'flamme' "flame" and Portugese 'lar' "home")), or caithastoomuchtimeonherhands?

      pitiful mood.   lauren is here spending the night and reminding me of my own lackluster existence. an hour ago lauren and devon were going to bed, but are still awake talking and messing around. i went in and asked them what they were up to, as i had already made my way to the couch. they ignored me. they didn't wave me off, they didn't flip me off, they did the very thing that any human being hates the most, acted as if i, cait, were invisible and inaudible. after a shot pause as they continued to look over a magazine or something and discuss it, i said "cool, sounds like fun" and left.  yes, i accept that i am fat and ugly and boring, yes, i accept that lauren is devon's friend now, and not mine, yes, i know that i'm much better off keeping a fair distance as attempting to be part of thier fun is a waste of time and incomprehensibly awkward, but there's no need to ignore me. i hate it. i hate it more than anything and i would fucking punch you before i completely ignored you.   people don't generally ignore anything  except nothing i am nothing i am not nothing  i suppose i am the definition of a loner. i love being alone. being with people can cause conflict, and i don't like conflict. it bothers me when mammaw nags about how i hardly go any place with people. she never thought that maybe i enjoy the quiet, the solitude. i come across as moody and "antisocial" as my mother put it to lauren and her friend when i avoided the giggling voltures at a BBQ and stayed across the street until the last minute.   i think i have mental problems. am i crazy??? maybe it's like the guy from "A Beautiful Mind" and i'm so intellegent i'll go nuts and need shock therapy and discover the formula for free energy but nobody will know about it. i have to wonder about that. i have to wonder if maybe i'm not a social creature because i actually believe that i'm so much smarter than everyone else that i won't even associate with them. i hope not. it's either that or my brains dun broke.  i'm quite positive that the next time the dynamic duo need someone to buy pizza or cover up for them or to stand on while lauren climbs trees, they will cease to ignore me. until then, or until tomorow, i shall be in a sad fettery.  and after i saved thier damn lives, too.   it's true! those dingbats were trying to bleach peices of thier hair and i was watching and devon grabbed some ammonia and poured it in the bleach! i jerked them up and shooed them off as the mixture fizzed and smoked, covered the bowl with plastic wrap, then proceeded to tell them the dangers of mixing bleach and ammonia. once i felt safe, i funneled the bleach back into it's container. i suppose watching them pass out and kill all thier brain cells would have been fun, but my nice girl insticts kicked in too fast. not to mention they don't have many brain cells left anyway.  AND SHANNON DENISE vv0/f3: i realize i'm a self-pitying shmuck, but tell any of this to lauren or devon and i'll just fucking kill ya.

      After reading  urlLink Jan the Ho's  most recent post, I was inspired to write about Manna House. Manna House is a buffet owned by the big bad Baptist church in Shreveport that all the other churches look up to: ((insert threatening music)) Summer Grove Baptist((LOL I wrote 'babtits' there originally. Thank goodness for spellcheck)) My step-grandmother who is always devising ways to get me into church never shuts up about it. Manna House is located in a shopping mall that was "converted"((LOL)) into a "church center". I think that a church-owned buffet is the funniest thing I've ever heard and it's so funny I try not to think about it. The only upside is the Sunday afternoon "church crowd" that all of us sinners dread facing has slowed considerably because they all meet up at the holy buffet. So, do you think that the waitresses stop and get in a line and pray every half hour? Because I've been to quite a few restaurants where they sing or do a line dance to entertain folks, but praying seems more appropriate for Manna House. Maybe they line dance AND pray?!?!? w00t!   the other thing is that I hate changing the litter. I love my cat, but I hate his shit that I am forced to drag around all the time. When I get older, I will find a desperate teenager and pay them ten bucks to come to my house every week and change the litter for my seven cats.

      Didn't blog yesterday, I was too busy. What was I doing for like...4 hours straight? Making sushi. It was tons of fun. Mom made the stuff and I rolled the rolls. The sticky rice was perfectly sticky and I must have been channeling  urlLink Morimoto  when I caringly caressed the seaweed into a lovely roll. Spicy tunas and shrimps with cream cheese for Devon. Good stuff. I wish you could have been there, tr0y.  got an email from Jonathan. He's going to work at a camp for autistic children and won't be back until Wednesday. Making autistic kids happy? What a darling!  my grandmother in Texas is back in the hospital. Ugh. What with cake decorating classes, guitar lessons, the possibility of getting a kitten, and all of her medical problems, I may not get to Texas at all this summer, which is what my dad deserves for being an asshole. It's father's day and I need to call him.  June 20 is an important day in my family. It's the day my mom married Rick, father's day, the day my grandpa jerry died, and I'm almost positive it's somebody's birthday, but I'm a horrible person and cannot remember anything.  I think my   urlLink entophobia  is getting worse. I hardly go outside, my heart started racing when I saw a guy getting attacked by bees on TV last night, and mom is threatening to take me to an IMAX movie showing of "BUGS". She's calling it shock therapy, I think it's just sick and twisted. I don't see how she can talk when she had/has a weird thing about crowds. Whenever she mentions dragging me to that movie I think "and afterwards we'll go to Woodstock and sit in the front row, alright?"  aside from that, life is boring and my butt is sore from all this jogging. It's a good way to pass the time I suppose. The other way I've been wasting my days is by making stupid necklaces. I just steal a few feet of mammaw's yarn and it takes me like 45 minutes to finish one. I've done 5 so far and I'm running out of different colored yarn.

      saw The Stepford Wives today. it was dumb. really dumb.  i looked quite sassy today. i had raggy curled beach bum hair and my big red aviators and managed eyeliner without looking owlish.  well.. i found out i won't be able to take html classes after all. i called the office and got transeferred like six times only to find out later that the website my mother had gotten her info from was from 1997!!! it sucks, and i wish it was 1997. i am taking beginning cake decorating instead, which will be fun. i do love baking.  last night i put some pain relief cream on the blister on my heel and then i bit my fingernail and the pain relief stuff was still on my hand and my tongue was numb for like 10 minutes.  i don't think i'll be doing much else except talking to   urlLink The Bald Taco  today. adieu, adieu.

      Today was boring and devoid of thought, therefore I must blog about it.   I woke up and showered early ((11am)) because I thought I was going to lunch with Steven. Well the lunch didn't work out so I went to quizno's with mammaw and Devon.   mammaw and Devon are about ready to kill each other, and I am ready to kill both of them. They fight like children and yell like baboons and it's no wonder Devon sleeps 20 hours a night.   after lunch I jogged on the treadmill, which is much more dangerous than it sounds. You see, the treadmill is in my room jammed into a corner. Err sort of like this:   so anyways I hopped on to the stupid thing and then lost my balance and then what happened??? I WAS JET PROPELLED INTO THE WALL! Luckily the treadmill was going slow and I didn't get hurt. I was still too embarrassed to tell anybody but my blog.  Steven gave me the money to pay for html classes. That man is such a darling. He just had surgery on his neck a few weeks ago and the poor baby is hurting all the time. That's the reason he couldn't make it to lunch today.  this afternoon I washed my cat. He is pissed. OH and I found a picture of Maximilian to show you how beautiful he is!!!   Max is my one and only darling and the most gorgeous cat on the planet. This also gives you a good view of our couch, which is a big joke in my family because it is so weird looking.  tonight we ate dinner at the neighbor's. The meal was such a catastrophe I have chosen not to relive it by writing about it.

       Man Murders Interior Designer, and on the Venetian Rug She Picked Out, Too   A South African man told a court how he hacked to death his interior designer because she criticized his decor, local newspapers reported this week.   Jose da Silva, 37, pleaded guilty to murdering 47-year-old Beatrice Harrowyn in 2001 after inviting her to his new house in a classy suburb north of Johannesburg.   "We went through the house and I told her what I wanted. She did not make any nice comments about my place so I went to my garage and fetched an axe," the Star newspaper reported him as saying.   "I killed her because she reminded me of an old school teacher whom I hated very much."  well well well. Now that I've restored your faith in humanity and interior design, let's move on.  my day was boring. The only thing I did was power walk a mile on the treadmill. I am fat, and am feeling particularly fat today because of the steak I devoured and now regret, as red meat doesn't agree with me very well.

      I am annoyed...By quogs  a quog is a scientific term that I just made up which implies a blog devoted to the monotonous and highly aggravating hobby of taking scanty internet quizzes and then posting the results((which usually come with some picture/anime/hoopla and a flitty paragraph on the "true personality" of the quiz taker)) on their blog, thence tricking innocent readers into believing that the blog they have chosen to partake in has any substance at all.  what kind of sick twisted naive brain damaged individual would spend all their time taking those stupid quizzes which are in no way related to the truth and then publish them on the internet, forcing me to click their blog on the "recently published" list, then quickly slap the "back" button in annoyance.  if these THINGS had any truth to them, then every single one of the results would read:     QUOG SLUT   "You are a quog slut! You have nothing better to do than sit around and leave your interpretation of self to a few random questions and the thankless idiot who founded the idea of internet quizzes".

      I'm only posting right now because I have found a fabulous blog and must quote it now.   From  urlLink The Blog of the Century   "I once saw a television show that said the best form of birth control is abstinence. That's kind of like saying the best bullet proof vest is not getting shot at."  yeah, I know this damningly clever anecdote doesn't apply to the fully flowered dapper dear that is me, but I think it's genius.  which makes me wonder. What exactly would be the allure of my blog? Is it that I snatched up the fabulous damselindistress URL? Is it that I use the word 'mercurial' in my title, that word that you thought you'd never be able to use, but can do so when referring to my blog in the course of your life? Seeing as I don't write porn or have naked britney spears pictures or spark epiphanies, it makes me wonder.

      Today was..Quite interesting and even a bit entertaining.  I got up at 12:45((a collective groan from the working readers as they long for highschool summers once again)) to find mom and Devon flitting around getting ready to leave. Mom is going for a spa bit/lunch/errands, and Devon is going to an art class, yes, an art class. Now I am a weensy bit pissed that my shitmunch sister had managed to find some summer entertainment and I was still waiting for some news on my html class, which will most likely never ever happen.   back to the story---I was home alone for a while and I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth and I was looking at myself in the mirror when I heard footsteps on the carpet. I immediately flipped out and slammed and locked the bathroom door. I stayed in the bathroom for about a half hour, yelling things like "take whatever you want and slam the door on your way out so I know you're gone" and "please go away". Then the phone rang, and I was brave enough to run into the living room and get it. It was mom, and she told me to meet her in the driveway to get some steak she had gotten from the butcher so she could continue her errands. Well I was in my underwear((yeah, I walk around nekkid when nobody's home)), but I wouldn't go in my bedroom where the robber was, so I grabbed a blanket that was folded over the back of the couch and ran out the door, explicitly flashing the neighborhood as I wrapped the blanket around me. After about a minute of hopping around in the driveway my mom pulled up, looking puzzled. "what are you doing?!" "there's a robber in the house and you have to go kill him". So mom grabbed a big umbrella from her trunk and proceeded to go into the house and bang things with the umbrella whilst yelling "hellooo?". When she was satisfied that the house was robber-free, she took me to my grandmother's friend's house, where my grandmother was fixing the friend's computer. After laughing uncontrollably for several minutes, she told me that the folks from the city had come to check the electric meters and what I heard was their footsteps on the side of the house in mushy wet grass, NOT their footsteps on my carpet in my room.   ha. ha ha ha. ha. ha.  Well once that ordeal was over with and all was well, Johnathan called me!!! We talked for a good while about stuff, and I inadvertently said the word "cute" ((I suppose you could call it a nervous habit?)) about sixty more times than I meant to, causing him to ask "is 'cute' your favorite word?". My looove.

      Well, here I am again.  I woke up this afternoon to an empty house, mammaw and mom were out doing whatever, and Devon was at Lauren's. Soon Devon came prancing home with Lauren and we had a grand ole' time. We all chipped in for pizza((ahem, I paid the bulk of it and Lauren paid a little))((we're pretty poor teenagers.. We had to pay the guy his tip in quarters!)). After pizza we turned on the Grease soundtrack and did the hand jive, it was fun. Then I took a shower and Devon found some old movies. We watched me in my 1st grade play and it was, to say the least, frightening. I had bangs, glasses, and a big bow on the tippy top of my head. Thankfully, I've abandoned all those things and blossomed into a beautiful maiden. ((sarcasm))  mom came home a while later and called daddy, she's arguing with him now. Here's the deal, I want to take a few HTML classes at Centenary((not LSU, oops Nick)) and it will be $150 for both of them. Well I emailed daddy and said this:  hey daddy   how are you? I am positively bored as can be. I was really disappointed when I found out I wasn't coming over this summer and I am rotting away in Shreveport. I think it would be nice to take an HTML((hypertext markup language)) class at centenary. I already know quite a bit about HTML and would like to polish up so that I can put my skills to good use. The link to the centenary highschool workshop page is at the bottom of this email and I would really love it if you would call and schedule for me to take the beginner's web page design class from June 23-27 and the intermediate web page design class from July 7-11. I love you and hope to see you some time this summer. Call me!   Love,  CAITLIN  http://www.centenary.edu/news/1997/May/summer.html PS: I talked to mompat on an IM, she sounds like she's doing pretty good. Keep me posted.   and last night, he replied with this:  Dear Caitlin, I'm really glad to hear from you, and I'm really glad you are interested in the class on HTML.  I wish I could take that class too.  I'm sorry I missed your call the other day, I did attempt to call you back, and in your message you asked about my hanging up on your mother.  I did hang up on her, as when I answered, I was in the middle of something and she was not speaking in a civil tongue and I am simply not going to tolerate that behavior any longer.  I'm certain she's stressed out, and believe me, I'm stressed too, but there's no need to behave in that manner, I don't behave that way, I've done nothing to deserve it and therefore I will no longer tolerate it. I know this will impact you and Devon, and for that I'm truly sorry.  I've wanted to call you many times over the past years, but I have been intercepted by your mother on numerous occasions and I've put off calling for that reason, it's just too much.  For this I'm very sorry and there's no excuse, I should call anyway, but now I'm afraid that it might make your life more difficult, so I don't.  I've been in your position before and sometimes it sucks. I send your mother ample funds for you to take the course, $75 is what I believe it costs, and she should be able to afford the class.  If this is not the case, please call me and we can discuss. I love you and miss you and Mama Pat will be better soon and you will be able to come to Tyler and even Nacogdoches and be with me, so please don't despair. I love you very much, Daddy   well mom made me print the email out and give it to her, which I probably would have done anyways, and it seriously pissed her off. So right this second, she is in her room yelling at him over the phone about child support and yahta yahta.  I watched Free Willy the night I babysat, and I cried through the whole thing. I got to thinking about it, and I sort of cry a lot. It's always weird stuff, too. When the kids' parents got home they were like "what's the matter?!?" and I was like "I, i, I was waawatching Ffree Willllly!" well anyways, that's what tr0y and I were talking about last night/early this morning. He's a cool guy.

      Although I have nothing to say worth reading, I still feel it necessary to blog my life away.  my little group of bloggie friends seem to be in a bit of a slump this week. Everyone is having a spot of bad luck...  for the last three days I have played the same song and I'm still not sick of it. Gypsy Rose Lee by the Distillers is the best thing ever and I don't know why, but I love it.  I was up until early this morning writing a letter to tr0y, so about 10 minutes after I woke up((at 1pm)), I was eating lunch... a chili cheese dog. The classic heart-attack-on-a-bun. Of all the things I eat, this has to be the worst. First it's the weenie, the fruit cake of the meat world, then it's the chili and cheese, more fat and calories to cover up the taste of the weenie. So what am I doing now??? Slowly gnawing away at a York peppermint pattie, my favorite candy after rice crispies.  I'm terribly bored, not to mention fed up with these people. Yesterday I was ready to run away. I was going to run all the way to Michigan to live with tr0y, or to Mississippi with nick. I don't think I could ever do that though. It would only take the cops a day or two to find me and even if they didn't.. What would I do once I got there?  I would like to be 5 years old again. When I was 5, we lived in this gorgeous house with a big deck and a hot tub. And we had a maid and a security system that I would always press the button for. I don't remember my room because I always slept on the chaise lounge in my mom's room. My mom bought me 2 dwarf rabbits that lived in the back yard, and I would play with them every day and when it stormed I would put them in our shed and sit with them. For some reason I remember racing my sister around in circles on the deck, but the hot tub was in the middle so it was a pretty skinny circle. I remember feeling sooo smart when I realized all I had to do to beat Devon was sit and wait for her to come around the circle, and she would always end up behind me and bang her tricycle in to mine and be pissed that I won. We moved out of that house right before I turned 6.   the other house I really loved was one really close to cross lake. When I think back, it was a pretty crappy house, but we loved it so much. The front was covered with petrified wood "tiles" and we had a guest house and in the woods behind the house there was an old barn that was full of nasty old cotton. My favorite thing to do was rake up all the leaves and then let babby((his name was Todd, and he was the love of mom's life at the time)) light them on fire. Then this other time when there was a hole in the screen on my bedroom window and some lady bugs made a nest and got in the house. It sounds pretty gross, but they never went anywhere but my window sill, and they would just go in and out all the time. Todd and my mom broke up, and Rick rented into the guest house. He was a nice guy, and my mom thought so too. Pretty soon he moved into the house house, and then we moved out altogether.  from there we went to the apartments, where we met Mr. Jean and IT happened((see end of may 8th post)). The apartments aside from Mr. Jean were cool because there were stairs and I liked having my own floor. There was also a pool where I had all these "boyfriends".  then we finally made our way to my old house, the one I always talk about. I had my own own own room that was perfectly decorated, and then the other bad thing happened((see end of march 24 post)).   I suppose that's pretty good.

      I was listening to some white stripes in the car with mom the other day and she asked me if i had ever looked up the meaning to any of the lyrics, i told her it was for the individual to interpret. It got me to thinking about how some people condemn things they don't understand. i thought, if you cut a Picasso into tiny pieces and organized all the pieces by color, you still wouldn't understand it any better, you'd only be left with a whole bunch of confetti, with which you could throw a party for dumb people. So think about that one, folks, perhaps the next time you find something you don't understand, look at the feeling, the mood, and never take anything at face value((unless it's money, and even then, it could be counterfeit money, or inflation could be moving so rapidly in the same instant you looked at it, the value would change)).  I was talking to jean today and she reminded me of a story. i call this story "Leigh Anne Sandwitch on Wheelchair Bread". in 8th grade i went to new Orleans on a class trip. We had an entire day to visit the French quarter. i was in a group with this extremely mean and evil girl named Leigh Anne. Nobody liked her, and it wasn't because children are cruel. She had broken her leg a few weeks before the trip and against everyone's advice, had still decided to go. Well since being in the French quarter required a lot of walking, she had been given a wheel chair. Everyone had tried to help her getting over bumps/cracks((the chaperone said we had to)), but she refused help from anyone. Because she had no guide, she was going wildly down the streets, yelling at us to leave her alone. Well she bounced along without any major problems((except giving us something to snigger about)), until we came to a large curb with a grate at the bottom, of course, we offered to help her, but she still refused. Well she flew over the curb, part way down the street, and into a big pothole in the middle of the road. The wheel chair and Leigh Anne toppled over, and the entire chair collapsed on that evil thing. Well she was fine afterwards, in fact i think the other people in the group suffered more from laughing so hard we couldn't breathe. It was a perfect comical moment.

      If you can tell me where that quote came from, I'll give you... a hug.  as you can see I've given my blog yet another facelift. The other one was nice, but icky. So I think, with the exception of maybe a color change, I've found a good template for now.  lately I've been feeling quite, er, flippity.  I would like to kiss someone. a nice big sloppy kiss involving lip gloss and the transfer of gum. I got to thinking about it, and I've never technically kissed anybody. There was Taylor pleasant in 2nd grade, but it was only because we had just gotten "married", and there was a time at a party, but we were playing a game where they pair you up anonymously in a dark closet and I have no clue who's lip/eye/nose/something I planted a big one on, and there was one other time when I was dared to lick my friend's brother's face. But that's crappy! I want the real deal, firecrackers kiss. The heart pounding, face melting, wonderful kind.   that's why I have one oranje bracelet that stands for a kiss, and the rest are clear for hugs. I want that one to be perfect.  I played bingo today, I won a dollar!  and by the way, I lost all my comments with the new template, so leave me lots!   ya lublyu tebya... it means 'I love you' in Russian

       urlLink  Ray Charles   died today. So, does anyone besides me find it strange how celebrities seem to die in phonetically coincidental pairs?  JO hn Ridder and  JO hnny Cash? Ron  REA gan and  RAY  Charles? I think it's a message from the powers that be. Like some kind of code.. JA-RAY, RAY-JA, RAJA? AJAR? Some cosmic Raja will leave the door to the universe ajar and we will all be sucked in? I suppose what I'm writing is pointless since by the time we got sucked in it would be too late and we wouldn't know we had been sucked in because we would be dead. Ok, so I haven't slept in 32 hours, perhaps you can tell? It is a fairly interesting thought process. It took me all of 10 minutes to put the pieces together.

      I'm in a mood. a BAAAAAD mood.  right this second, I would like to abandon all precedents and just fucking kill everyone. I would like 6 tattoos, 5 piercings, and a bucket of crystal meth. I would like to fling a gordita at the woman behind the counter at taco bell and THEN get arrested for it. I would like to hijack a fedex plane and take it to a deserted island where I would sit. I would like to yell really loud and break something and THEN push it under the couch with my foot. I would like to write fake suicide letters on the walls with bingo dobbers. I would like to slash someone's tires for no apparent reason. I would like to do all these things in the span of a week and top it off with an acid trip and an unplanned leap off of the nearest bridge. Instead, I  blog.  I am sick of my mother. She is a lush, a drunk, a seriously aggravating piece of work. I am sick of adapting, and would like it if someone would adapt to me for once. I would like for somebody to say please. I am sick of being blown off, getting over it, and forgiving everyone. I am sick of being resented for having a password on my internet diary and constantly pestered about it, as opposed to writing in aimless journals and scribbling on wedding pictures like I used to.  today I was talking to troy on AIM. We were discussing Reagan and his pros/cons and how he could have slowed the AIDS epidemic. Mom came into the office, whiskey on her breath. She said "if he is weird, then I will find him and kill him". Troy had a lunch appointment, so he left. She freaked out. "MOM WALKS INTO THE ROOM AND SUDDENLY HE HAS TO GO???" she yelled, as I hopelessly tried to reason with her. She started clicking like crazy, blocking troy and closing AIM before I could show her our conversation. She went into a fling about how "if she couldn't have the password to my blog then she WILL BE THERE WATCHING ME ALL SUMMER". She makes me sick with her drunken swaggering slurring stupid self. It's EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. Will we ever have a peaceful day when she's sober and we all just kind of... Coexist harmoniously?  I want to go to my dad's, I want to do something. I want to escape. I want to... Croak.

      In an attempt to forget the recent disappointment of having my summer plans smothered in one foul swoop, I have been doing the better part of nothing, which involves eating waffles and flirting with Jonathan((my latest fling-a-roo, sort of))  johnathan's a doll, a real doll, and I swear I've never met someone with so much moral fiber. Whether or not the fiber is a good thing, I don't know yet. We just like to talk. We talk about movies and poets and  urlLink  sex bracelets   and our favorite things.  what are a few of my favorite things? I self-absorbinately assume you ask?  *color-red then black then blue *flower-iris, a black bearded iris *dessert-rice crispies *name-coralie, celemene, timbre, Vincent, Isis, auguste, Marlowe, Sloane, Edward, maxmilien, Faustus, chelle((since I'm not having any children, you can place all these names with cats and/or fish))((but seriously, couldn't you imagine a big fluffy cat named Faustus?)) *smell-almond extract, gardenia, marijuana((not kidding, smells great)) *holiday-Christmas((someday the pagans will steal this holiday back! Until then, well, happy birthday Jesus)) *sound-an e minor chord on a perfectly tuned guitar, a kitten's meow, a thunderstorm *soda-diet coke with lime *actor-Sean connery, Nicole kidman, tobey maguire, john Wayne, Lucille ball, Brett butler, Richard gere *phrase-wtf? *curse word-shit ((prnced: sheete!)) *digit-right thumb *bone-scapula *body part-medulla oblongata((nope, didn't make that one up)) *time of day-night  whew... I stayed up all night watching informercials and now I'm in need of a nice cup o' jo. I decided the best way to get back on a normal sleep schedule((as in NOT sleeping past noon)) would be to exhaust myself so that I'll be in bed nice and early.  have I mentioned that my mother said I could have my eye brow pierced? Well I was fuckin all excited until mammaw overheard and said she would throw me out on the street if I had it done. a small fight about how piercings are removable and it wasn't life or death ensued between mom and mammaw. Well seriously, what's the big deal? I can ALWAYS take it out!  kittens, piercings, moving out for the whooole summer, all caput. My life is just one big disappointment! Woe is me!  ((lol)) ((too sarcastic to be pitiful))

      Well.. Eh.. You know.  yesterday was nice. I saw Harry Potter avec muh peeps finally. I could write pages on the short comings and horrible editing of this little ditty which completely undermines the book, but I'll spare you this time. It was a nice PG 3 hours of entertainment nonetheless.  I went to the mall with Lauren and the terrible two, which is always a mistake. Luckily I had a cell phone and was able to escape the abercrombie wrath that is 3 nitwits((Lauren, Devon, Valerie)) and a mall. I bought some black bracelets, as my clear sparkly ones are starting to run out as a make new friends. I also found this amazing purse which I cannot afford and shall not take part in any expensive((expensive being more than 10 bucks)) ((shut up, I'm a teenager)) until I can buy the lovely wonderful staple of my daily raiment. Shall I describe it ((the men can close their eyes and say booga booga booga)) it's made out of.. seatbelts! Yeah, it's all this seatbelt material woven together and I looove it. Most unfortunately, it's 120$, meaning I must raise another 40 bucks.  then finally, although I was exhausted, I babysat. Another 30$ to add to the purse fund.   have I mentioned lately that I hate children?  today was, to say the least, a shitty one. ((C'mon, you knew that was coming! a whole Monday of fun and you thought Tuesday would be alright?)) it began this afternoon at 1PM, when I woke up. How the hell I slept 10 hours, I don't know, but hey. Probably the main reason is because I had another weird dream. I dreamt that I was in a crib((that's a baby bed, not a gangsta's abode)) and that a guy climbed in, smooched me, then kinda disappeared, then he did it again, then all these different kinds of dogs jumped into the crib and layed at my feet, then left. And all the while, I was aware of the fact that I was in a barn that's a few miles back into the woods near my house.  today I found out that I won't be able to go to my dad's AT ALL this summer. THIS TOTALLY SUCKS BIG GREEN DONKEY DICKS. Although I am upset at the prospect of rotting away in Shreveport this summer, I'm surprisingly unfazed. It's almost as if I expected this to happen. Perhaps my mother is right and daddio is truly an asshole. I wasn't there when he made the call, but my mother said he said that he couldn't handle kids what with work and all. Um, helloooo! I'm sure you are really busy, daddy, but I still exist and it's your fricking seed that dragged me kicking and screaming into this sublevel media obsessed drug dealing backstabbing hellhole.  after the fight with my dad, my mother felt it neccesary to get drunk and bug the shit out of me all afternoon and into the evening. just what I like after finding out my father doesn't want me, dealing with my crocked mother.  one more thing--- urlLink Jan the Ho  wrote a really great post today.  oh, and the reason I'm not blogging more is because my grandmother found out she doesn't get the thingy on the thingy on the computer, so she's been "fixing it" for the last week, in other words, staying on here from 9AM until 12AM, literally.

      Yes, I know I haven't posted in a few days, but it's with extremely good reason.  I have been completely absorbed by the last book I read, "The Da Vinci Code". It is by far the best and most intriguing book I've laid eyes on since "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance". If you're a woman, you must read it, if you blindly follow the Christian bible, you must must read it, if you enjoy a good story, you must read it.   I would sit here and explain the whole story, but that would take forever. The main point is is that it's amazing what the church has done to cover the truth of history. The mission of the main characters is to find the holy grail, supposedly the cup or "vessel" that held Jesus christ's blood. BUT WAIT! A vessel.. Couldn't a vessel be something other than a cup? A person, perhaps? Jesus Christ was a mortal being, he lived a normal life until his crucifixion. He was married and had children with Mary Magdalene. This is the theory the book is based on. It said that Constantine and the catholic church rewrote the bible in an attempt to make Jesus more like a celestial being than a human religious leader. Over 80 accounts of Jesus' teachings were considered to be put in what people today consider "the way", but only a few, including those of Jesus' closest followers or disciples, made it in. in an attempt to further cover up the truth, they made Mary Magdalene out to be a prostitute. of course, this is not the whole book, it's 750 pages of the best book ever. all I can say is, I knew the bible was a load of wholly misinterpreted crap, but I didn't realize it was THAT BIG of a load of wholly misinterpreted crap! read it, read it, read it.  my grandmother in texas got out of the hospital friday night. she sounds like she's doing fine, but my dad doesn't know when i'll be able to come over. I am seriously losing my mind now. between devon's shit, momma's drinking, mammaw's bitching, and never having a second of peace, i'm ready to kill someone.   i'm going to see HP with Lauren, Devon, and tiffany tomorrow. I'm sure I'll love it. Plus I've got the OK that tiff can spend the night, and she's always tons of fun.  last night my mother and my neighbor were yammering about alcohol. For someone my age, I've got quite an opinion about a good drink. Like my biggest thing is American beer. It's piss! Watered down piss! As my Canadian bloggie buddies may know, a good Canadian beer is the best and there's no comparison between that and some crappy football game Budweiser baloney. My step dad was Canadian and he's the one who introduced me to.. I can't remember the brand name.. Was it molson? Anyways, don't touch that bud, it's nasty crap.  of course, if I have a choice, J&B neat is the only way to go.  I hope I'm not an alcoholic. I live in the biggest addiction family I know of, our main vices being gambling and drinking. I positively adore gambling, drinking is pretty nice, and I refuse to try drugs for fear of getting hooked. My position on drugs is about as uncool as it gets. I say don't try it, don't do it, stop it. You may as well just slap a D.A.R.E. sticker on my forehead. When you've had someone as close as your mother involved with that kind of thing, it seems much less silly.  there is a bingo dobber on the desk in the office, and my sister just put pink circles all over my arm. I am so sick of Devon, I could punch her. But she got lucky, because by the time I scrub this ink off my arm, I'll be too tired to kill her.  I'm looking for a really great book to read next, any suggestions?

      As you might notice, my blog is looking a bit different these days. suprisingly, making this template had given me the most grief. there's supposed to be a bit of "starry night" at the top, but it's not showing up right and i don't know why!!! hopefully i'll get it fixed tonight and fill in the links section with some music, ect.  it turns out our neighbors will be coming back from florida early, as in TOMOROW NIGHT! that means i'll spend the whole of tomorow cleaning up this place and then be forced to leave my nice little vacation place. i am getting a little sick of it though, so i don't mind much. i am ready to kill these dogs! they bark and beg and whine and poop all over and drive me crazy. ((driving me bat-shit-zu, as tr0y would say)) not to mention the fact that the pool is the most horrendous shade of green i've ever seen. i guess i shouldn't complain though.  tomorow the harry potter movie comes out and, staying true to the book geek ideals, i'm TOTALLY PSYCHED. i'm sure it's plenty edited so that it will apply to all age groups, which sucks, but it's understansably so. either way, i will like it and i will see it at least three times before i tire of looking at the adorable face of daniel radcliffe, who plays harry. i love these british guys! i could just totally take daniel and put him on a cracker.  i think i'm reading a little too much of  urlLink Tiffany's Blog . i checked my poem "Cirque" and it's like, was i on drugs? i guess now that it's summer and i'm all relaxed my mind is free enough to come up with that kind of stuff. i like it.  today i hung out and watched "the others" avec mes amies. i like this movie. it's like, scary, but not so much that i'm freaked out for the rest of the day. plus it's a good story. we acted out the play that inspired the movie in drama class freshman year, it was good too.   i'm totally bored out of my mind.

      I don't really have any good reason to blog today, as I have accomplished nothing, not even a complete thought.  last night it stormed horribly, I was up until 3am when the weather finally chilled out. I woke up at 10am and kind of messed around until 12pm or so.   I spent the better part of the afternoon drinking some incredibly strong coffee, talking to  urlLink  GARY O  , and playing that awful game   urlLink  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City   which I thought would be quite dumb and boring but is absolutely not. I'm ashamed to say that it is deliciously fun to hit people with baseball bats and steal cars, but then again, I'm only human.  right at this moment, there is a yellow jacket under a pillow in the middle of the living room floor. I spotted him there while I was watching the news((finding out we're getting more storms!)), and quickly flung the pillow at him before he could fly away. Now I'm here, a little jumpy, because I'm worried he'll crawl out from under the pillow.  lately my mother has been extra crazy. House sitting and not being with mammaw all the time makes her think she can drink all the time. The night before last she completely flipped and yelled at us forever and made all these weird threats. But that's not the important part of this story.  the important part is that I'm sick of her craziness and I want to go to Tyler. But there is a but, a big BUT. My grandmother((mompat)) had a heart attack and is in the hospital. She lives with my dad in Tyler, as I may have mentioned before, and is the reason I hardly ever visit him. But I decided to bite the bullet and make nice with her for the sole reason of getting away from Shreveport. Well crap, since this happened, I will be stuck in Shreveport even longer.   why do I sound so horribly selfish and lacking concern for my poor grandmother, you ask? It's because there has never been a time in the last 5 years that my mompat has not had a heart attack RIGHT before we come visit. I swear to um... Well I swear to something that it's true! I talked to my dad and she's doing fine. They treated it with medication and she'll be out in a few days. cuh-rap.  I've been thinking about life in Tyler for the entire summer. What will I do all day? I have absolutely no friends there. Ok, so I'm not the biggest social butterfly, but 2 months without friends or going out would suck. Where do you meet people my age outside of school? Maybe I'll try the internet thing? But that's pretty dangerous. Maybe I'll sit at Barnes and noble alone for hours and hours until someone approaches me? I guess I could always chill with my cousin, but she's a flitty cheerleader chick, and even though she's nice I doubt I would fit in her circle. hmmm...  today I baked a cake. A coconut cake. Now, in my opinion, I am the greatest baker in the world and should pursue my dream to be the next Julia child, but mom says chefs don't make enough money and she needs to be well taken care of in her old age. How any of this is relevant, I don't know, but then again how is this blog?  you know, I think I use scotch tape when I make a friend instead of glue. I always come across as so charming, so interesting, and then once that person is my buddy and I get comfortable around them, they realize what a crappy specimen of the human species I am, and suddenly don't call as much. Maybe I just don't take initiative. Maybe I want everyone to come to me and I never make any effort to keep friends. Maybe people are just flaky.  song: Gypsy Rose Lee by The Distillers  all of the sudden I am hit with the worst headache. I think I need some more coffee.

      it's been a quite icky 48 hours since I blogged last, but since today is my *6 month* anniversary of beginning this most mercurial sort of soliloquies, I felt it necessary to say something, if not a multitude of things.  HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO MEEEEE!  there are a ton of bracelets on my left wrist. Every time I find something that resembles a bracelet I slip it on and it stays there. Most of them are clear sparkly things I bought from a teeny bopper store in the mall. I don't take them off unless I'm giving one to somebody, which I do when I make a new friend. It's like my trademark, and I like to think that the owners of one of my precious bracelets are proud to wear them..   yesterday my sister and her friend Valerie chopped up some old clothes and sewed them back together, forming some of the most hideous garb I have seen since I went to steinmart with my mother((we all remember the speech about how the only thing that should wear lime green should be LIMES, correct?)) so, once I had gotten over the shock of seeing my violet satin bridesmaid's dress shredded and superglued to a pair of old blue jeans, I was able to laugh, and laugh, and laugh. Then I wrote a song about it, but I don't remember the words.  I have decided, with the help of everyone who's ever been around me when a bee has flown by, that I am entophobic. On Saturday I let myself get grounded because I was afraid to go in the garage and clean up something because there was a wasp in there. My mother pestered and bullied me about it, saying I was nuts and she couldn't believe I would rather be grounded than be near a wasp. I replied simply by saying that I didn't laugh at her when she was so afraid of crowds she couldn't go to the grocery store. ((for a while after she got off the drugs, she had some kind of withdrawal symptom that caused her to have panic attacks when she was in a place with more than a few people))... Well this really struck a chord, as she still gets a little nervous near huge crowds. So she's been totally nice about it.  What is the cause of Insect Phobia?   "Like all fears and phobias, Insect Phobia is created by the unconscious mind as a protective mechanism. At some point in your past, there was likely an event linking insects or bugs and emotional trauma((when I was 7, I was stung in the forehead by a hornet)). Whilst the original catalyst may have been a real-life scare of some kind, the condition can also be triggered by myriad, benign events like movies(("arachnophobia", the end of "the craft")), TV, or perhaps seeing someone else experience trauma((sister getting stung through her bathing suit while trying to turn off the waterhose after playing in the sprinkler and her head swelling up))"  that is just some thing I pulled off of google, but everything in (( )) is me. you see!!! I'm afraid of big flying bugs because they could sting me, small ones because they could fly in my ears or mouth, crawling ones because they might get into what I'm eating or do the same as small flying bugs, and all bugs in general because they are filthy disgusting creatures. It's getting to the point where I won't even go outside anymore for fear of a bug, and I don't know what to do.   ((current noise: Mrs. Robinson by the Lemonheads. I love this song!))  well, I meant to tell you about my mom and how crazy she has been lately and Steven and all that, but I'm sick of typing and I'm going to save it for later.

       yessss i know i haven't blogged in frickin forever.   lots of shit has been going down.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole time that we have been in tyler, devon has been calling mom and lauren and telling them that she is miserable when in fact, she is not. mom freaks out, lauren freaks out, devon tells mom she wants to come home, mom goes psycho when dad "won't let devon come home" EVEN THOUGH the conversation about it went exactly like this:   dad: dev, do you want to go home?  dev: well it's up to you, do you want me to go home???  dad: ((says nothing))  dev: say no  dad: ok... no.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so to make an exponentially long story short, mom went into insane "mother bear" mode when dad wouldn't answer the phone and she drove all the way to tyler to come get us in the middle of the night, but she never got us. so mom was calling like crazy and freaking everyone((everyone being mompat, my grandmother, who happens to have a giant vendetta against my mother and used this fiasco to her -sick and twisted- advantages)) out. FINALLY after a huge "family meeting" i convinced them to let me talk to mom alone, which i knew would calm her down.  so i talked to mom for about an hour, eastablished the fact that devon was just being a shit disturber and that she was not, in any way, shape, or form, miserable. well by then, everything was fine and dandy. mom was still upset, but she was going back to shreveport and was not going to get arrested or have anyone arrested.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then all-of-the-sudden, without warning, we were back where we started. aparently mom had called the house to apologize and mompat had sent her back into orbit. so in a fit, i sort of yell at mompat((respectfuly)) without actually accusing her even though i knew what had happened. so mom was still in tyler, not leaving, calling police, having a fit.   by that time, i just COULD NOT handle it anymore.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so mompat is in a terrible mood trying to get us to sympathize with her when all we wanted to do was smack her. we decided to try to let mom cool off alone this time and it worked((sort of)), so she went back to shreveport. i was simply frazzled to a fray but still being dragged around shopping for an outfit to wear to the family reunion among other things.  now that it's all said and done, only one thing is for sure: devon is the perp. devon is a little shitass brat who will say ANYTHING to get attention and coddling from mom. devon orchestrated this entire ordeal, and it blew up in her face. devon was playing both sides against the middle and i REALLY hope she's happy because it was a fucking shitfest.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ok... so chances are i played about a 5% role in this blow up. here's what happened: daddy and roseanne went out of town and were gone for like 3 days. the day before they came back, dev and i got into a little snit and i called mom and was all mad at devon. well devon called mom after that and did the pitiful misery dance and all that. so mom called dad and told him he needed to come back and fix us. well then dad called me to tell me that mom had called him and i told devon and mompat overheard. so mompat has a hissy fit at the dinner table. she calls my mom a money grubbing skank who doesn't deserve a penny of child support((you know, the child support that buys my lunch)) and who loves to stir up shit because she is a sick psycho. all this had me pretty upset, but it was the "and you two will end up EXACTLY like her if you don't get yourselves straight" that sent me over the edge. i locked myself in the bathroom for 3-4 hours, then headed straight to bed. the next day, mompat tried to bring it up but i cut her off as sharply and abruptly as i could and made up excuses((of the diorhea persuasion)) to curb her suspicions about the time in the bathroom.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oh my mother fucking gawd! what kind of grandmother is it that bashes my mother in MY presence? at the dinner table?! doesn't she realize what kind of damage that can do on a child?!? i mean, i've done enough psychology research to know what's going on, but devon has NOT. mompat puts these ideas in her head and she sucks them up like a fucking sponge! it's crazy, i tell you, completly insane.   well... once alllll this crap was over the only one who was still flipping out was mompat. so yesterday dad, roseanne, dev and i went to the zoo. i had a great time! i forgot how much fun it was to walk around and see all the animals.      Rose, Me((in my mood glasses, of course)), and Devvie  after the zoo we had lunch and i ordered mexican. we were home for a while and then we headed to a party for a friend of my dads who had just returned from iraq. we didn't stay at the party long because the lights on the entire block went out due to a power surge from the inflatable jumping castle that was set up for kids in the front yard. so we headed over to a restaurant and it was almost completely empty because it's power had also gone out. so we had more mexican food((yay!)) and then headed home to bed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now it's already sunday. mompat is still in a bad mood... and when i say that, i mean it. in fact it is so bad that dad, dev, roseanne and i are escaping to dallas for the week, which totally thrills me. it will be from dallas to tulsa to shreveport.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just in case you're curious((because i know mammaw was)) roseanne is a doll. she's quite lovely to be around and we've been having a good time with her. devon is still weary of her because of my dad's last girlfriend, who was a real live psycho bunny-on-to-boil bitch who inflicted quite a bit of damage on poor devvie's pea brain.    next installment: the political rantings of moi

      **************************************  why am I writing this? What is the point? I don't want anyone to read this, ok? I just want it out there and not in my head anymore.  &nbsp;  I think just about everyone knows a sick fuck or two. The puppy-drowning arsonist type. I have the esteemed pleasure of having one for a sister. She is the most awful person I know. She is a bastard, a fucker, a complete C---. ((now you see, I'm not a complete potty mouth, but there is most definitely no better word to describe Devon))  &nbsp;  aaah! Now I know exactly why I'm writing this post! Because my mother and grandmother((secretly)) read my blog, and I want them to know what kind of sadistic shitmunch Devon really is. I want them to read this and think "what the hell?" "we should chloroform her ass like a rabid dog!" "she should be sent to maury povich and then straight to bootcamp" "I knew there was something wrong when they cut her out of me and the noon sky turned blood red and all the black cats in the neighborhood came to the hospital doors and died"  **************************************  &nbsp;  well... I wrote this post yesterday when I was really mad at Devon, and&nbsp;even though I still think she's a sadistic little fuck I'm too lazy to elaborate on the story. So I suppose all of you can just squirm with curiosity and never sleep again wondering about the mystery&nbsp;of that particular fight.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  everything is pretty hum-drum and boring around here in Tyler. Daddy and Roseanne went to&nbsp;Dallas&nbsp;intending to stay overnight, but delays turned it into a 3 day thing and they finally came back tonight.   sorry folks... I just haven't been feeling like blogging lately, nor do I&nbsp;have anything to say.   I suppose I'm just tired and icky because of my ear. I've been taking some cousin of penicillin and all kinds of vitamins((because my dad is a vitamin nut)). He swore that if I took 9000 mg of vitamin C, which is 18 capsules, that I would feel&nbsp;better, and I hate to say it, but&nbsp;he was right. I mean, I'm sure the penicillin&nbsp;and codeine have something to do with&nbsp;it, but still. I'll just be sooo glad when the damnt thing stops hurting...

      Here I am once again. I've been at daddy's since yesterday morning and am having a nice time, as long as I don't think about the burning scraping excruciating pain throbbing in my right ear.  &nbsp;  it was killing me yesterday, so mom dragged me to the emergency room and after a three hour wait and an exam from a doctor with very, very spiky hair, I found out I have an inner and outer ear infection. Now folks, I've thrown my back out, I've gotten migraines, I've sprained wrists and ankles, and I've never never never felt so much pain as I have with this infection. It is simply... Agonizing in the deepest sense of the word.  &nbsp;  so this is the worst thing I've ever felt, right? So knowing me the only logical thing to follow would be that the painkillers don't work. Well, they just fucking don't. In fact, I took one on an empty stomach this morning and I hit the floor. Actually I got to a chair and only blacked out for a few seconds, but still, I've never had that happen before. The drugs don't work, the ear&nbsp;drops don't work, so all I can do is pump up with antibiotics and OTC stuff. Needless to say, I'm a-suffering.  &nbsp;  I'm a-suffering and am also a bit annoyed with all these people clamoring over me. I mean, yeah it would be nice if I passed out that you wouldn't let me hit my head on something, but I'm FINE. I-AM-FINE and even though my ear is killing me it doesn't mean I need to be quarantined.  &nbsp;  that's basically it I&nbsp;guess.&nbsp;stay tuned.

      Tr0y mentioned today that I don't really talk about my friends much on here. So I figured I'd post a pic of lauren's latest project:  &nbsp;  this is Kermit, the lizard... The late lizard. ((very, very late)) they ripped him in half ((on&nbsp;"accident")) and taped him back together. He was SO cool looking they couldn't help but scan him in! ((the faint of heart/stomach&nbsp;should look away now))&nbsp; &nbsp; disclaimer: yeah, this really happened, and yeah, this is why i&nbsp;don't talk about my friends much on here. &nbsp;

       this new blogger thing is nice, fonts and all.     &nbsp;   talked to daddio yesterday and it looks like I'll be going((with my sister))((fuck)) to stay with him until the 30th, whereupon we will go to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to attend a 50th wedding anniversary/family reunion gala for roseanne's posse.     &nbsp;   family reunions... Never been to one, and have never wanted to attend one. I suppose it's the stigma of the thing: the heavily stoked uncles((uncle guffman))((jk)), the veil of false sincerity, the sprinkling&nbsp;of unidentifiable casseroles which&nbsp;were all&nbsp;undoubtedly created in the microwave which is powered by the cigarette lighter in the station wagon, the shaking of sweaty hands, the diet-sprite-and-apple-juice-concentrate punch, the&nbsp;loud and annoying children all squeezed into last years Easter outfit, along with their flustered "faux fancy" parents in similar raiment, the fine patina of lip gloss and make-up covering everyone's cheeks by the end of the endlessly long evening. I suppose I watch too much TV.     &nbsp;   hopefully it won't be so bad, although arguments have already commenced on the&nbsp;subject of my outfit, which is horribly ugly&nbsp;and unsuitable for someone&nbsp;like me. it's a black long dress that's&nbsp;plaid on top. &nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   I suppose I dress sort of like.... A hobo hippie weirdo. Like right this minute, I've got on a tye dyed shirt, black pants with a hole in them, and a whole bunch of sex bracelets and hemp necklaces. my hair is jerked back "beautiful blonde pineapple" style ((hope everyone caught that "grease" reference)).&nbsp;This black dress with the plaid and such is about as far from me as it possibly gets.

      On days like these, it's hard to know where to begin.   the last 24 hours or so have been like some kind of badly done twilight zone. I'm feeling it.  I'm feeling it in my stomach, which has been in a state of perpetual indigestion for the last 3 days. Some have supposed meditation, antacids, but I am supposing a quick brick to the head would do the trick.  saw Spiderman 2 yesterday afternoon((against the advice of tr0y, but with the advice of Steven, who said Anchorman was a stupid piece of shit))((sorry tr0y)) the bleach blonde Baptist church PTA bitch directly in front of me seemed to think her cell phone was more important than the comfort and enjoyment of the other 30 people in the theatre, letting it chime out "Yankee doodle" 3 TIMES AND having pleasant conversations without leaving the theatre. The nutcase directly behind me was some sort of nervous psychotic old biddy who kicked the back of my chair when something exciting happened. I politely cleared my throat at the cell phone bitch and turned around to glare at the old biddy, who NEVER payed attention to me and seemed to be totally unaware that her feet were doing some sort of annoy-cait jig. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the height of rudeness. The reason I come to a theatre is to sit in a cold, dark, quiet room and enjoy a movie that I paid 5 bucks to enjoy, YET for some reason they think they have the right to fuck it up with cell phones and footsie!!!   bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch.  and now that I think back on that movie melee, I wish it were the bulk of my problems.   later that night: mom is acting crazier than usual, being an outright bitch from hell. I'm doing my best to ignore her. She sways into the kitchen and begins picking at the leftovers((because she wouldn't eat with us)). All the sudden, she's gagging into the sink, yelling for my grandmother. mammaw gets there just in time to slow her descent to the floor. Our neighbors arrive, one of which is a fireman and EMT. She floats in and out of consciousness and gags occasionally. Someone finally calls an ambulance and Devon and I are shooed out of the area. She's carted off the hospital and we((Devon and I)) are left home alone.   I sit at home, awaiting a call and making a few calls of my own((thanks nick, Johnny, and Donna for talking to me in freak out mode)). I'm unsure of what to do and Devon is being an absolute fuck, so I go to bed and fall asleep around 1AM.  at about 2:30AM, I am awoken from a very deep, medicinally enhanced sleep to find my mother, who is supposed to be at the hospital, and my sister standing over me and yelling very, extremely, unbearably loud. For the first 20 seconds I don't know what mom is talking about, so I try to ask her how she's feeling, and I get more yelling. Finally it clicks that this woman, the one who was unable to stand up without passing out, the one who had me scared to death, was yelling at me because I had thrown away the cheese and herb grits that she had made for dinner. Apparently Devon was told NOT to throw away the grits, but let me do so as she watched me clean up the kitchen.  so I lay in bed for a long while. I listen to mom scream at Devon about the grits and how she's an awful child and things like that. When she quits screaming, Devon comes banging into the bedroom and turns a bright light on my face. From there, she smacks me in the head and yells at me for throwing away the grits. I am half asleep and spent, so I take her verbal flogging without a fight or completely opening my eyes.  at this point, I was all done. I was... Done. It was the feeling you get when you falter and your heart gets caught in your throat. I threw out my arms, looking for something to grab hold of, and found blankness. I layed still and whimpered as my guts folded over and over on themselves, and was too afraid to get out of bed and check the scene.   once Devon leaves, I listen to mom belligerently meander into the kitchen and make more grits while mammaw exasperatedly tries to get her back to bed. Finally I drift back to sleep.     I awoke to the sound of unfamiliar voices and crying children. Out of bed and fuzzed, I came to find a young woman who looked creepily like one of the dixie chicks, and 2 toddlers wandering around our livingroom. The girl's car had broken down, apparently, and so I watched these strange kids while mom and dixie chick went to check the car. The younger one didn't stop crying, and the older one didn't stop smiling at me.  mom seems to be doing fine, she hadn't had anything to eat for a few days and she was terribly dehydrated. She's gone to get her nails done now, and left me to worry about her passing out and running off the road.   poor mammaw. Poor, poor mammaw. Mom has been a bitch to her through the whole ordeal and it's just... Been a really bad day. I offered to buy her quizno's and ice cream, which is our thing that we always do together, but she has to take her brother to the doctor. Apparently since the death of his father-in-law((grandmother's brother's wife's dad)), uncle bobby has been getting worse and worse.      now I'm here, and my stomach hurts.

      Well I suppose, seeing as I am knee-deep in dead people, that I am doing pretty well.  my grandmother's brother's wife's father and my great-aunt have, in the span of a week, both died. I suppose I ought to be a bit upset, but I'm just not feeling it. I didn't know either of these people and I don't think death is something to be mourned anyhow.   Friday... A very good day. Around midnight me, Devon, mom, and Lauren struck out and went to waffle house and wal-mart. We bought some duct tape and I got a whole bunch of my absolute favorite t-shirts: Hanes tagless stain-guard tees. I LOVE them. Came home, chilled and made duct tape purses.   Saturday... Got into some more juniper berries and felt awful((roasted brazilian snapper with buerre blanc sauce and spinach salad))((they were in the form of capers this time, and I didn't realize!)), but babysat anyways. JUST when I was pondering the idea of children and how they may not be so bad, this happens. I don't know why the little monsters were so awful, but...Yeah. Running around, screaming, punching, locking eachother in the dog kennel, hell.  Sunday...Messed around.  Monday...Swam all morning, felt shitty all day, don't know what's wrong with me. I suppose I feel sort of bad for not going to the grandmother's brother's wife's dad's funeral, and making mammaw go by herself.

      Back once again, feelin'... ickay  didn't post yesterday. Felt it would be a waste of time to write about wasting time. I basically did a bit of everything that could be considered nothing.   today was different.   woke up earlier than usual and headed to bingo. Fun fun fun. Contrary to the normal sequence of events, I actually won. It was cool except that I had to share my winnings with 7 other people who had won, leaving me with $28. It's 28 dollars I didn't have before I suppose. Headed to the "gettin' place" after that and bought a couple pairs of pants.   came home.  mom made seared tuna steak with roasted asparagus and buttered parsley potatoes. It was day-um good. I wouldn't have mentioned dinner, as it is always some culinary epiphany where my mother is concerned, unless it directly affected my well-being.   what happened is mom made steak for Devon and mammaw because Devon is allergic to tuna and mammaw is allergic to things outside her tiny tupperware box. I tried a bit of mammaw's steak, which had a peppercorn and juniper berry crust, and came to discover something: that I am allergic to juniper berries. I puffed up, itched, my stomach hurt, and I felt shitty all night, and still do to some degree. Mainly I am annoyed and feel a bit high, which is why I've been bouncing around all night and exasperatedly yelping at everyone.    night before last, Jonathan called and we talked for about six hours. It was nice. He called again today, but we only talked for a wee bit and he was supposed to call back.   Lauren is spending the night and someone gave her a painkiller for cramps. I think I'll go watch her giggle at disconnected funnies and glaze over at any notion of clarity.

      Finally. After days of suffering, the biting of nails and the gnashing of teeth, the constant fear that all my blog darlings will abandon me and go begin their lives, I am back. I can't help but feel as though it's Christmas morning as I frolic into the office to make my triumphant return to the super highway. I think I've definitely had my fill of the outside world.  Saturday-I get to sleep at 5am, get up at 8am, go to longview and chill with my big sister, Kelsey, who has lost a TON of weight and is doing wonderfully. Went to a "party" with Kelsey and Devon which was actually a whole bunch of lame Mormon "20 somethings" getting together to talk about Mormon life, dating, church, and so on. Most of kelsey's friends didn't even say hello to Devon and I, and basically blew me off when I went out on a limb and said "hey, I'm caitlin" to a couple of them. Devon and I spent most of the evening sulking and talking and drinking((fruit punch... Gotcha)). Finally at around ummm 11 a couple of guys came over((quincy and tony)) ((Kelsey has a crush on quincy)) and we played cards and had a good chat. It was refreshing to find SOMEBODY who wasn't SO in denial of the fact that they were, in essence, just dumb teenagers with ID's that they couldn't lower themselves to talk to me, the "little sister". Got home around 3am, so tired.  Sunday-didn't sleep enough, arrived in Tyler around noon. mompat is doing well, and so are Daddy and Roseanne. Roseanne is the lady who lives with mompat and takes care of her and also HAS BEEN DATING MY FATHER FOR A YEAR. I was shocked, to say the least, when daddio finally told me. Dad also told me that she had "traveled Europe, modeled, seen all the museums, and was really nice". Feeling quite bristly, I made it a point to ask tons of art questions, mention tons of names and pieces, essentially out-arting her. I felt bad afterwards, as it was obvious she was intimidated. Although I try not to be intentionally mean most of the time, I couldn't help it when she started blathering about allll the museums and things she had seen and how her family owned a bunch of crap and yahta yahta why don't you quit bragging. As I erringly described da vinci's "Vitruvian Man" and argued the location of "The Thinker" ((it's in new york)), I was thinking to myself "yeah, you CAN appreciate fine art via the internet."   I suppose now that it's all said and done, she is a nice lady and absolutely nothing like my dad's last girlfriend/wife, who was an uber bitch and will be about %10 of my therapy bill. It's only natural for me to be highly critical when it comes to his girlfriends these days, and I was over it by the next day.  that night we had steak and my uncle mark, aunt Jody, and baby cousin Tommy((the one from the picture in my other post)) came over. We had a nice time and Tommy is ADORABLE as toddlers tend to be. His favorite word is dirt, which, coupled with his baby babble "accent", sounds much like "duht".  finally piled into the car and drove and found some fireworks. I'm not sure what was more explosive, however, the pyrotechnics or mompat's frantic bitching about traffic and how if we didn't leave RIGHT THEN we would be stuck forever.  Monday-wake up late and go to kelsey's grandparent's house, who are my half-grandparents and I love them dearly. We have a nice time and eat a lot and play dominoes.   Monday night was the pinnacle of my trip and the most fun I've had in a good long while. We went to quincy's house((where he lives, along with his ENTIRE family)) ((I think it's a Mormon thing)) and we had a rousing game of FIREBALL! Fireball is awesome. The concept is this: you take a rock, wrap it in cotton yarn, soak it overnight in kerosene, light it on fire, and toss it around a circle of friends. I loved every minute, and I hope I get to do it again soon.  Tuesday-sat around and did nothing until 10pm, when I saw "The Terminal" and, as I expected, it was fabulous.  Wednesday-finally came home.

      I'm sure you'll all be pleased to know that for the first time in quite a while, I am rising and shining in what we consider the "morning", meaning I got up at 10AM.  although I've only awoken to grace the earth((ha, joke)) for a bit, I've already slurped up some peanut butter toast and talked to Kelsey, my older half-sister, whilst slurping. Tomorrow morning I will be making my way to longview where Kelsey lives and will stay with her over the holiday weekend to return Monday.  because my blogging habits have reached the point of unhealthy psychological dependence and because Kelsey does not have internet hookup in her apartment, I will be utilizing the newly discovered audioblogger to keep everything up to speed.   I can't wait to see Kelsey. She recently returned from new York after singing at Carnegie hall and I am sooo proud of her. I think everyone who's ever met Kelsey has fallen in love with her instantly, seeing as she is the nicest person I know. Perhaps she has digitized a few of her pictures from new York and I'll be able to copy them on CD and post them?  the only thing I'm not sure of as far as kelsey's goes is the fact that longview is practically a hop, skip and a jump from Tyler and we'll probably be heading to daddy's house for fourth of July. Mom seems to be quite worried about this, as they've been indirectly feuding about it for quite a while, beginning with my plans to spend the summer there falling through, mompat's heart attack, and the so on so fourth details that aren't important.

      Not sure how I mustered the energy to make it to the computer. Apparently I cannot stay awake forever, as I've been hit by the quasi-proverbial "brick of fatigue".  didn't do much today... I went to the store and bought a new carafe for the coffee pot because I shattered the other one in an explosion of day-old drip and glass shards. There are still bits of glass on the floor even though I mopped the whole thing... I suppose I'll just have to get Devon to walk around in there barefoot to catch any leftovers.  just when I thought I was free to throw life away on the computer/vegetate/jam the folks called, and I babysat for five hours, which is a bit more than usual. While sitting I encountered the hamburger affair, which is actually just a series of phone calls following the delivery of my dinner, a burger and coke.   -10 minutes after starting my burger- "caitlin, don't eat... Have you eaten?" "yeah" "all of it?" "nope" "well I don't think the meat is good, it tastes a bit funky"   -after 10 minutes of reveling the impending food poisoning- "caitlin, I think the burgers are alright, your mother just put an entire bottle of worcestershire sauce in the meat and probably some other seasoning shit" "that's good, 'cause I ate it anyway"  once that was over, i proceeded to put the kids to bed, resulting in a screaming, crying, wailing symphony, which lasted until the folks came home.

      Yet another day gone by in a slurry of mcgriddles, lemonade, and sleeping.  I was up until six this morning talking to my new friend  urlLink Luis  about well... Everything. He's a cool dude.   and um, where the fuck is  urlLink Tr0y ??? Did he die???  anyways, at six when Luis passed out from sleepiness, I had one of those crazy industrious moments in which I cleaned the whole house, made tea, lemonade, coffee, and fluttered around in some sort of sleep deprived euphoria. By 11 o' clock, I felt horribly shitty what with mother fucking nature working her magic((I'm ready for menopause, I tell you)) making me want to scrape my ovaries out and stirfry them. Thankfully, that never lasts long. I slept from 11-3, having nothing better to do than listen to the rain. When I woke up I sort of wandered about the house, showered for the second time, and watched Jeopardy(("Ken Jennings returned for the 20TH time to play JEOPARDY! On Tuesday, June 29TH. Ken triumphantly added $40,000 to his earnings. His jackpot now stands at $662,760."))((this guy must know freaking everything, eh? He's a trivia buzzsaw)).   it's now 3:36AM... What am I doing up?     Me((all sweaty from volleyball)) with Bess((not looking sweaty))     My cousin Thomas((AKA Tommy))

      Truthfully, I don't feel like blogging. But I feel I owe it to the more excitable folks in the group to give a little update on the mom situation.   she was gone all afternoon, giving Devon and I time to fester. By the time she came back at 5pm to pick us up and bring us to have dinner with our uncle mike((who is not really our uncle...)), we had festered up a storm.  digression: 10 years ago Devon and I had our picture made and put on coffee mugs which were doled out to certain family members, including uncle mike, who was my grandpa's best friend, eventually adopting the title "uncle mike" by my mom as a child and then by dev and I. For the past 10 years, uncle mike has proudly drank his coffee out of that mug, then caringly washed it by hand and sat it on it's spot by the percolator. It's quite recently that we got back in touch with uncle mike, so I was quite surprised to see that mug sitting on the counter unfaded, cracked, or otherwise, most unlike the other copies of the mug that people have held onto over the years.  so there we went, dreading a meal with my mom and apprehensive about the emotional juggernaut that was bound to hit when we presented uncle mike with another mug that sported a recent picture of Devon and I and a caption reading "We Love You Uncle Mike!", which I had bought while in Dallas. Of course, he more than loved it.  after a nice but fairly sullen dinner, we went back to uncle mike's to compare the mugs. He said I looked like a young Lauren bacall:     I think his chimichanga may have gone to his head.   the ride home is where it gets bad.   for approximately one half hour, she drove us around and screamed at us. Except this time, she said it was the  fact that we never did our chores and she spent all her time and energy making us do chores  rather than us alone. For future reference, if you ever wanted to see me cry until my eyes roll back in my head, just scream at me steadily for more than 5 minutes. I hate yelling. I-HATE-YELLING. There's just something about loud voices that if you blamed me for world hunger with your voice jacked up a few levels I would probably believe you and if not, just be quite upset for quite a while.   when she finally let us out of the car dev and I were, for all intensive purposes, puddles. We ran wildly to separate bathrooms and then proceeded to wail and choke and cry unlike we have since we were four. This continued for several minutes until I hacked up my enchilada and a staggering amount of diet coke, which also quieted Devon because we had been listening to each other and she heard what she later described as "chunkies"((the two bathrooms aren't connected, but they're right next to each other)). So I sat and blubbered less violently until mammaw needed to pee, at which point I let her in and stood behind the shower curtain while she peed and I mumbled some explanation for the histrionics. Apparently mom had left as soon as we got out of the car and had gone to a hotel. So mammaw called mom and had a fight with her, which made me feel bunches better((Sarcasm)).  once mammaw hung up and stormed to the patio, I listened to Devon run water for a few minutes. At first I thought she was trying to drown herself, but I knew she was too scared. I too stared at the razor and the faucet for the longest time, considering my options, but decided against it at the last second. A while later, mammaw came and told me mom was staying out all night, so dev and I wandered out of the bathrooms, bleary eyed and exhausted. dev told me that she was going to drown herself, but instead sat in the full bath tub with her dinner clothes on for several minutes, peeing on herself in defiance and then skulking out of the tub when she considered the grossness of sitting in piss.   "I'm too lazy of a stupid ingrate to piss in the toilet!" she said.  "then I must be too lazy to digest my food!" I replied.  around 11, after Lauren had come over to stay and we had gone to the store and gotten some cheap therapy((chocolate cupcakes)), mom called and asks us what we wanted to eat. She had sobered up, realized a few things, and was on her way home. Once the message was across that nobody was hungry, we decided a midnight run to wal mart might cheer us up. Mom apologized quite profusely, saying that she had a good point, but not a good delivery, and we forgave her. I bought the Yeah Yeah Yeah's CD "Fever to Tell" and some strange looking light bulbs that emit a low green glow and make our room look like the set of a porno ((I did not intend for the end of that sentence to rhyme)).   we got back around 1:30am and Devon and Lauren passed out around 2am. I stayed up until 6, listening to "Fever to Tell" 3 times and wildly cleaning our bedroom around dev and Lauren((honestly, if you can sleep through the yeah yeah yeahs, I would be checking for a pulse))((but they did)). By the time I reached the couch, I was quite droopy.  today was much better. I slept until 1, had a waffle, got the Distiller's "Coral Fang" CD off of eBay, then had McDonalds for dinner, which is only mentionable because there is something, I believe it is a French fry, stuck in my esophagus. Actually it was there until about an hour ago when my grandmother got an inexplicable but unignorable craving for donuts. How can I resist fried dough??? I think the donut must have dislodged the french fry because I can't feel it any more.  mom has gone to a cocktail party and then to a friends, mammaw is going to bed, and I plan to have a lovely night to myself consisting of talking to pumpkin head and enjoying some tranquility.

      I have just been informed, from the mouth of my own mother, that I, we, Devon and I, are keeping her from living a full and happy life.   "we are the reason she is tired", she says. "for two weeks while we were gone, she was content". "For two weeks there was no knot in her stomach, ache in her head, need to stay in bed all day". She continued with things of this nature until I had to walk out, feeling putrid.  I am sickened.  I am sickened to know that every time she told me I was the light of her life, her reason to get out of bed in the morning, the only thing in her life that kept her going, it was a lie. That I am actually some sort of parasite, dragging her down to the bottom of the bottom.  my heart screams to know that all the times I had consoled my mother, petted her head, dragged her back from the edge with oddly placed wisdom and curling witticism, I was actually just bandaging wounds that I had inflicted, but had not inflamed.  this is a day I will always remember. This is a day that will stand out with the fingers and boxes and needles and letters that cobble me together. This is the day I will learn that leaving clothes in the bathroom floor really does matter. This is a day that will be invisibly etched in her tombstone for me to see so that when people ask me why my head is turned away from her grave, I will have no answer to give them... The lyrics to a silent requiem.   this is the day I learned the truth about mothers.

        You know, I kind of thought at one point that my eyes were too small for my head, but this picture doesn't really show it, which is nice.  it's like 4am, I should go to bed, but I don't wanna.   I would really like to write a decent post complete with some intimate and depressing details of myself twisted into a quite charming farce of life that couldn't possibly be true. Alas, I am too tired to do anything but say this:  I am finally home. Safe and sound. No more Texas, no more Roseanne, just chillin'. Lauren and Devon had a touching reunion... Rolling around the front yard yelling each other's name. Sometimes I wonder about those two. Of course Lauren is spending the night and OF COURSE they have gone to bed already. Gone to bed... In my goddamn bed. I suppose they didn't think that perhaps I, cait, who has been sleeping on couches/foutons/floors/chairs/in the car/everywhere for the last two weeks might like to sleep in my own bed. it is simply the height of indecency and if I were the type to write a book about manners I would put that in the section of the book called "MAJOR FUCK UPS USUALLY RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF A CLOSE FRIEND"   I could wake them up, seeing as I had asked earlier this evening for them to sleep elsewhere so I could enjoy my wonderful bed. But I am a spineless jellyfish who thinks far too much about repercussions of my actions, ultimately accomplishing nothing.  I suppose one more night on the couch won't kill me.  I'll just be pissed when mammaw wakes me up in 3 hours so she can sit in her spot and watch Good Morning America.  really, really pissed.  the only thing that's keeping me from jumping off a bridge is the fact that i've got songs from the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band CD stuck in my head. it's got to be one of the best albums ever made.  My favorite of all time:  Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she’s gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.  Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you’re gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.
