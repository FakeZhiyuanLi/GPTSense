      Why the FUCK is this place so fucked up. Here I am, typing about my insecurities to a whole world of the blank minds of people who drown into the net. People are dyeing, sick, fucking sheep and all I can do is live and never help. Im 16, and Im 83...I'm stuck in a poor family where we blame each other for our problems, so I go to my friends house, Where I can look but not touch his and his families problems. Look but dont touch...look but dont FUCKING TOUCH!!!!!!! I only had ONE saving grace, ONE person to find happyness in, ONE person who cared to pick up the phone and call me when I was popping the sleepy time pills. Now she's gone. After two years of my shit she packed up and left. And I'm alone in my head. Shes not coming back, she's to far gone. She is now out of my reach, and no matter how hard I try, I can only stretch my arm so far. Alone. I have friends that I can see, that I can hear, but I cant touch them. I know they try to care, but they have their own stress to deal with. I can feel the howlers, they are comming for me now, but I wont go down without a fight. Something will die.

      Well I'm mad. Today at work, I sat down. I had nothing to do at all, so I sat down. Then Danny, our employer, started bitchen at me for sitting on my ass. Danny is generally a nice guy but this pissed me off cuz he hadnt givin me shit to do all day! I mean if he gave me orders Id gladly follow them, so this was his fault...wasnt it?

      Man...I got a job. Me and my buddy Tim got a job as a carpenters assisstant, and it pretty cool I guess. The only problem is that It's super freakin   hot  , and there is so much dust in the air. For a first job, this is sweet. Eight bucks an hour, 10-11 hours a day. Awesome money. I'm tired as shit. Night night.

      Wow...today my younger brother Bryce completely cleared out my "Shit list" in an afternoon. This list took years to make, and now its gone...and why am I not grateful!?! The guys on the list showed up threatening my brother for GOD knows why and he and his trailer park buddies...the ones I affectionattly refer to as the TP's...completely beat the living shit out of the guys. It was great. Bryce and his buddies all keep padlocks on their belts, and they used them today as brass knuckles. No more shit list...

      Topic of the day.........Betrayal!     I have a very small amount of friends, I admit...but these friends are closer to me than anything else, and sometimes these friends are all I've got. Out of my FOUR friends, 2 were mostly gothic, 1 was more of a fedisher (for lack of a better term) and the other was the only of us that didnt wear dark clothes, the artist. Myself, I've kinda always been the middle man, a cross of all my friends dipped in acid and covered in nappy curly hair. Well, My friends and I have all had our problems, typical teengoth probs really, depression, relationship trouble, lost religion, lost reality...etc. None of us ever did drugs. For the most part we are all against drugs. Then one of my friends, the artist, met a guy. This guy was a big time stoner druggie, but despite his drug problems, we were happy for our friends for finding a guy. The guy managed to turn our girl into somewhat of a wreck. Ive heard rumors, and witnessed myself enough to belive he turned her to drugs. The artist girl started treating one of the 2 goths like shit, and practically mocked his problems, not cool. Now my artist friends has pretty muched gone away, and I'm left with only 3 friends. To my artist friend, Please, get back on the right path, I understand your disagreement with goth friend was deep, but it can be fixed, try to end this crap.
