      where have i been, you ask?  busy, busy, busy!  i am known as "julie the cruise director" to those who know me well.  i'm always planning something or have places to go, and people to see!  well this weekend was no different.  j.'s parents, sister and niece invited themselves over to the pool one day.  i don't have a problem with this, but j. seems to.  i also invited my stepsis over and her family.  why not make it a party?  it was a very impromptu thing and those are sometimes the best times!  it was a really nice, relaxing day in the sun, the sun even decided to come out!  i was so excited about it, i didn't put enough sunscreen on...ouch...don't touch my back!  the next day i went to my friend p.'s bridal shower. loads of fun!  the ruse that she was attending a scrapbooking session was the excuse used to get her there.  all week, i didn't want to talk to her, afraid that i would slip up.  i was supposed to be going to this scrapbooking soiree as well, but she hadn't mentioned it to me at all.  so, i ended up just sending her an email about it.  she called me and told me she was going and at what time.  i cold only giggle as i listened to her message...if she only knew...she had no idea that this was going to be her shower.  her family was having a surprise birthday party for her brother that night and she was convinced that was going to be her shower.  g. even had the sign in the atrium of the hotel changed to say scrapbooking instead of bridal shower to throw her off the trail even more!  when she walked in she couldn't believe it!  bridal bingo was planned during the gift opening.  what a hoot!  each square is filled in with something the bride might receive at the shower, cutlery, china, wine glasses, towels, picture frames, cookbooks, etc.  there were some real gamblers in the audience...wondering if candles could be considered a sexy item, and asking what every item was in a multiple-item gift in case it was on their card.  anything, to get a bingo!    after that, a few of the girls decided to continue the fun at a restaurant called sky.  they have the absolute best green apple martinis.  they taste just like a jolly rancher candy.  they have several kinds of martinis, so i tried a godiva chocolatini for my second one...eh, don't know why people rave about that!  it was way too strong and tasted like a melted mudslide!  after that i switched to beer.  we kept saying, this is our last one, this is our last one, but each time, it seemed like someone still had a full beer and they would say, ah, go ahead and order another!  we could have stayed there all day we were having so much fun!    last night j. and i went to the james taylor concert with b. & m.  it was a great night and we had fun, but jt is too mellow for me.  he had a 20 minute intermission in the middle of his set...i could have napped!  it just didn't flow well for me.  phew...anyway, that is what i've been up to...nothing like filling my plate up and going back for seconds.

      and last night wasn't the end of my commuting misery...this morning, i planned on taking the later train because i wanted to sleep in a little after being out late last night.  well, don't you know, the train leaves 15 minutes late this morning.  everyone standing on the platform was mumbling something about no air-conditioning, blah, blah, blah!  geez, maybe i should drive in?  i'd be in traffic, but i'd have air-conditioning.  i decide to give it a chance, maybe these people are pessimists and don't know what the hell they are talking about.  i get on the train when it pulls into the station...air-conditioning is running just fine to me.  the problem today is, no double-decker cars!  by the time we got to the 3rd stop on the line, the car was looking like a can of sardines.  didn't matter to me though, i had a seat, and i was reading the 2nd installment of the harry potter series!!  with all that out of my system, i still have a couple of pet peeves to add.  do i dare?  ah, what the heck, commuting can't get any worse!  *  i hate when there are two people sitting in the 3-seaters on the commuter rail, one on each end of the bench, and a 3rd person wants to sit down, the person in the aisle gets up to let the person sit in the middle, rather than scooching over and letting them sit down  *  i hate when the person on the end gets off the train and the person in the middle doesn't mover over to the aisle  *  people who smell  *  parents who don't watch their children and let them run all over the train  *  the train gangs who sit at the same table every day like it is "their" table and no one else can sit there  *  people who talk too loud on the train, so that the whole car can hear them  ok, i think i'm finished....have a good day!

      well, it seems like the public transportation warlords got revenge on me for my post.  this is how my commute home last night went:  i left work to catch the 5:10 train out of south station.  the train is always on track 5, so i get on and sit there, and enjoy the air conditioning. a girl comes dashing onto the train and plops down next to me and is examining her foot, which is in a blue flip-flop.  it looks like it was digging into her foot.  i've had this problem recently, so i said something to the effect of, "don't you hate when that happens?  you never know the shoes are going to hurt when you've only had them on for 5 minutes in the shoe store." she says, "i know, and i ran all the way here to catch the damn train...my feet are killing me!."  it is 5:10 and the train is packed.  the train starts to move and suddenly stops, lights go off, air goes off.  i'm not alarmed immediately, because this sort of thing happens sometimes.  i figure, they stalled the train, they just need to start it up again.  a few minutes later, the conductor announces that something is wrong with the train and the mechanic is on his way.  i looked at the girl next to me and said, "you ran all the way here for nothing".  no estimated time of arrival of this mechanic is given.  i'm thinking to myself, ok, you would think there is a mechanic right there, maybe a few tracks over, he's not on call from weymouth or anything like that.  as the minutes tick by, the car is getting hotter, people are making hushed calls on their cell phone to their wives, husbands, friends, "yeah, something is wrong with the train, i'm going to be late."  these calls fell immediately on the heel of the calls that went something like, "yup, made the 5:10 train, i should be into the station at 5:45, can you pick me up?"  j. and i are supposed to be meeting a friend at 7:30 for dinner in stoughton.  maybe i should get off and take a train to stoughton?  what should i do?  i called j. to get his input.  he said do whatever you want, i can always pick you up where you end up.  twenty minutes later, another announcement, this train isn't going anywhere, please proceed to the equipment (they don't call them trains, they call them "equipment") on track 1.  so, we are herded over to track 1, i still get a seat, thankfully, and it is air-conditioned.  of course, the train is even more packed, because the people that are there early for the next train get on this one, i'm sure they are thinking - how lucky am i today?  meanwhile, the other  98% of the commuters are moaning and groaning.  i don't let it get to me, these things happen and there is nothing you can do.  the last straw was that some of the cars didn't have air-conditioning!!  i just count my blessings that i got on an icy, cold, glacier-like car...because that would have gotten to me - it was damn hot out last night.  i ended up getting home 1/2 hour later than usual and we were only a little late for our dinner.  dinner was at the town spa in stoughton with my old friend s.  i haven't seen him in ages.  he just bought a house and recently got engaged.  i met s. at my last job back in 1991.  he actually got me the job i'm at now.  he no longer works here, but we are still friends.  we got 3 appetizers, all of them fried, french fries, onion rings and something called chicken knots.  they were new on the menu, and s. wanted to know what they were.  they were chicken tenders in the shape of pretzels...weird.  he also got the omelet pizza...that too was new and was an egg cooked on a pizza, no tomato sauce.  he said it was good, but would definitely request sauce next time.  i got a thick crust mushroom and j. got a black olive pizza.  we stuffed ourselves silly...shouldn't have gotten all of those appetizers...oh and i forgot to mention a few beers on top of it all!!  it was great to catch up.  i hate that we all seem to let life get in the way and lose touch with people.  it is nice though that when you do get together, it is like you just saw the person yesterday!

      * an pet peeves of public transportation  * crowded train * people who don't wait for the passengers to get off the train before getting on * people who cut right in front of the people who are doing the right thing and waiting to get on the train and board the train * getting on the train and standing right in the doorway * standing in front of a seat instead of sitting in it * passengers who leave their trash, coffee cups, bags, food, newspapers, on the train * dirty seats * people who sell things on the train * unintelligible announcements * announcements that are too loud * passengers with large backpacks on their back that don't realize they are whacking everyone in the face as they walk by * people who put their bags or packages on the seat and look at you like you are a jerk for asking them to move it so you can sit down * people who don't let the elderly or passengers with children to sit down * obnoxious teenagers causing a scene on the train * loud crying babies on a very crowded train during the rush hour home  i swear any manners people have, if they have any, go right down the tracks here!

      it seems the daily zen has welcomed me aboard and invited people over to my site to see what is going on.  i've read a bit of zen and a bit of the dane too...they are much better writers than me.  i'm more of a throwing-what-i'm-thinking-out-there type of person.  so, sit down, take a load off, have a drink and enjoy yourself!  welcome to the lo dogger's piece of the web!  oh, and comments are always appreciated.

      yay!  i finally used my pool tonight!  i raced home from work, in the sweltering car, threw my bathing suit on and jumped off the diving board into the 74 degree water.  j. was pumping up a two man raft.  the beers were floating in the "turtle bar".  it doesn't get any better than this!  i even went down the slide a few times!  i felt like a kid again!  granted, the bathing suit looked a lot better on me when i was a child.  can't believe i actually put one on.  oh well...i have a pool!  i say whateva, who cares!!!

      i just came back from lunch with my friend n.  she was drinking this white frozen type drink with the cool 'bubble' top.  she's like, "have you tried this?"  i'm like, "no, what is it?" "it's a vanilla creme frappacino from starbucks."  i tried it....yummy!  it's like a decadent vanilla shake.  i figured it was probably made with pure cream and must be pretty fattening, because, of course all good things are!  well, after lunch, i had to get my own - i'm a sucker for anything new.  i asked the guy behind the counter, "can you make that with skim milk?"  he smiled and said, "it is automatically made with skim milk!"  how happy am i?  now i don't have to feel guilty drinking it!!

      i have finally jumped onto the harry potter bandwagon.  i never had any desire to read the books.  the other night, j. and p. said you should just give it a try, you'll love it.  so, off i went with the sorcerer's stone.  i read it in two sittings!  i loved it.  if you haven't read the book a complete spoiler is in the next sentence, so don't read on...i totally did not expect quirrell to be the one trying to steal the stone.  caught me totally by surprise.  i was actually crying at the end of the book.  i'm such an emotional person.  i have already asked j. for the next book, the chamber of secrets.  i can't wait.  it is actually better reading them all at once, rather than having to wait for the next one to come out.  i did that with the stephen king gunslinger series...and it is torture waiting for the next book to come out.

      window boxes...check, shopping...check, laundry...check!  woo hoo!  i've actually accomplished some things this evening with some help from j.!  the window boxes look lovely.  i hope the flowers bloom more than they are now...they are looking a little saggy.  now i'm just sitting back and relaxing.  i started to get sucked into the television, but i decided to walk away and make an entry here.  i am going to watch king of queens at 9:30 though.  i love that show!  all i have to do now is get my stuff ready for the morning.  see, j. likes to sleep in the morning and is totally NOT a morning person whatsoever.  i am SO a morning person.  i pretty much step out of bed with a smile and a laugh and then skip off to the bathroom to take a shower.  he is mr. grumpy.  i get everything that i need for the morning, ready the night before.  otherwise, my graceful self would be stumbling around the bedroom hauling shoes out of the closet and tugging clothes out of the overstuffed drawers causing a major ruckus that even sleeping beauty couldn't sleep through.  i'm very thoughtful and considerate of j. needing his sleep and try to keep the noise to a minimum.  needless to say, we have two dogs that live next door that aren't so considerate.  they usually start barking around 6am.  mr. grumpy usually awakes and he isn't smiling, laughing or skipping! ;)

      it's monday and i'm tired.  i'm trying to figure out what i want to do tonight - go to the gym, go shopping, or just veg.  the beau has a hockey game tonight at 9:30, so i feel i want to hang with him until he has to leave for the game.  i should really do my window boxes...i know i said i was going to do them yesterday, come hell or high water, but i didn't.  we spent the whole day yesterday driving all over the place in the pouring rain trying to find an umbrella we liked for our patio set; we went to pier 1, kmart, linens and things, and finally found one at target...on sale to boot!  i didn't like the one that came with the set because it didn't have a crank on it, it was just a cheap manual one.  the one we ended up buying is rectangular in shape...very different, i've never seen anything like it.  of course, they didn't have a stand in stock, so we still have to buy one of those.  all this yard working, planting, patio setting...is all leading up to our 5th of july pool/barbecue party.  we still need to buy the most important thing...a barbecue.  i've pretty much invited the world, so it should be a rockin' good time!  i look forward to good food and good times with good friends!

      yesterday was the 1st official day of summer and we're all geared up for it! we bought a patio set, some flowers for my window boxes, cut the grass and cleaned the pool! but, if you looked outside right now, you would be somewhat disappointed...there is no sun in sight. last night we had some major thunderstorms. lots of loud thunderclaps, bright lightening. i'm hoping god is up there rounding up the sun warriors. maybe they have been slacking off, maybe they don't like to work as much as i do!  i'm going to plant the flowers in my window boxes today no matter what. i will set up a work area in the garage. i do not have a green thumb and am not related to martha stewart. the woman at the nursery was giving me instructions on how to pinch off the dead flowers so new ones will grow. i usually just plant the flowers and let them do what they do. let's hope they live for a little while at least :)  as i was inspecting the plants and flowers that are growing in the yard, i noticed these bright red bugs on my lilies. the only reason i know they are lilies is because a martha stewart-like person told me. otherwise, i would have told you they were pineapple trees. that is what they look like...the tops of pineapples. so, i go online and google "red bugs on lilies". turns out they are lily leaf beetles! here is a lovely description of them: "the adult beetle is bright scarlet red, with black legs, head, antennae and undersurface. it is 1/4" to 3/8" long and is a strong flyer. the beetle reportedly will squeak if squeezed gently (however, few gardeners are willing to be gentle to this beetle). the adult lays reddish-orange eggs which hatch into particularly unpleasant larvae, which look like 3/8" long slugs; colored orange, brown, yellow or green with black heads. the larvae eventually become fluorescent orange pupae." and their personal hygiene leaves something to be desired: while they feed, the lily leaf beetles cover their bodies with their own excrement (called a fecal shield), giving them a grotesque appearance. ewwww! the article stated that you could remove the insect and eggs by hand. i attempted to do this, with gloves of course, but i kept getting all squeamish. i knew i needed to bring the big guns in. off to the nursery to get some backup. i purchased a bottle of "sevin" which is supposed to kill the insect and the larvae.  let's hope it changes their lifecycle: "the adult beetle overwinters in the soil or plant debris and emerges in early spring looking for food and a mate. after mating, the female lays eggs in lines on the underside of lilium or fritillaria leaves. some damage is done by the adults at this time, but the major damage comes when the eggs hatch into larvae in 7-10 days. the larvae voraciously consume all leaves within reach and may then start on flower buds. this continues for 2 to 3 weeks, when the larvae then drop into the soil and begin to pupate. in another 2 to 3 weeks the adult beetles emerge to start eating again. this process occurs from early spring to mid-summer. reportedly the beetles won't mate and lay eggs until the next spring." it seems all they really do is mate and eat. some kind of life, huh?

      i heard a disturbing weather statistic today.  over the last 23 weekends, we have had seven nice ones and on 16 of them it rained, snowed or some combination.  what the heck is up with that??  too many dreary days are going to definitely lead to people killing each other.  you think road rage is bad?  how about road rage in the rain?  rain just makes people unhappy and downright depressed.  it's funny to listen to people these days, and i am guilty of it myself, "how about this weather we are having?"  "can you believe all the rain we have been getting?"  it's just like when people say, "is it hot enough for you?" if the sun will start shining on a more constant basis, i swear i will never utter any of the above sentences again!  so i'm begging, please, mr. sunshine, thrust your rays through the clouds, show us a rainbow, shine on us, give us tans again, force us to wear our sunglasses to shield your glare, bounce your sunbeams off the water...i dare you!

      last weekend i went up to laconia for biker weekend with my friends, j, p, l, m, j, c, and a.  i started attending biker week in the year 2000, just after my divorce.  my friends had been attending for even longer.  none of them ride bikes, but just enjoy the wildness of the weekend and meeting interesting people.  there is definitely lots to see and do!!  i didn't realize that i actually enjoyed looking at the bikes, hearing the loud pipes and drooling over the paint jobs.  this led me to think about getting my motorcycle license.  my boyfriend has a 2001 harley fat boy.  we do lots of rides with his club and i love riding on the back, but thought, how cool would it be to ride together?  more and more women are riding, and it was evident last weekend.  in september of 2002, i earned my motorcycle license via the motorcycle safety course.  my friend l. and i took it together.  i highly recommend the course.  i had never driven a bike in my life...over the span of 15 hours i learned all the basics of riding and most importantly how to ride safely.  now all i have to do is buy a bike!  that is where the "bad with money" comes in.  someday i will have one!

      so, let's see, first real post, what to say, what to say?  let's start with a little something about me.  i'm a 35-year-old divorcee.  i hate that i am referred to as "divorced".    why is it that on forms you have a choice of three checkboxes:  single, married, or divorced.  why can't it just be single or married?  yes, i'm divorced, but i'm still single!  i'm in a committed relationship though.  maybe there should be a checkbox for that?  single, in a commited relationship.  we recently bought a house together.  what the hell, let's add a checkbox for that too.  i'm sure i could come up with a lot of other checkboxes.  how about single, in a committed relationship, with a house and a cat.  how about single, in a non-committed relationship, having casual sex, living together?  that would throw a lot of people off, don't you think? i just hate being pigeonholed into that divorced checkbox!   i live in a suburb about an hour south of boston on the rhode island border. i commute to work in cambridge.  i've been at the same job for almost 10 years.  it is very long commute...2 hours door-to-door.  i used to say that people who traveled this long to work are crazy.  i guess i've entered crazidom!  i would really like to work closer to home so that i can enjoy my new house with its in-ground pool!  i live with a great guy who puts up with all my emotional baggage.  we are both pretty laid back so i think that helps.  he makes me laugh and that is what initially drew me to him. we all need laughter in our lives, that is for sure.  he has a great heart, would do anything for me and loves me unconditionally.  sure, we have our little issues as all couples do.  he forgets things; i'm bad with money!  the good far outweighs the bad.  i'm all about adventure.  i love to try new things and have a lot of fun!  i've been parasailing, skydiving, had my body painted, been inked, and earned my motorcycle license. i am a happy person who loves smileys...so much so, i designed a tattoo that incorporated a smiley into the design.  it's an "L"(for my first name) with a smiley looking out of it like a window.  that was my 2nd tattoo and is located on my ankle, i have two others; four blue footprints on my right hip and a large tribal looking sun on my lower back.  well, that is a little bit to start you off.  i hope you come back to read more!

      It seems like this is the place to be...online, sharing thoughts and happenings for anyone who is bored enough to read them! I'm just starting out, so be patient. Hopefully, I will have some interesting things to write!! I'm going to check out the doo-hickeys and thing-a-ma-bobs and see what this is all about.  It seems very easy to use.  Stay tuned!

      why do dogs bark?  they bark at everything and nothing at all.  i think they bark just to hear themselves bark.  my neighbor has two shitzus...one barks all the time.  the incessant yapping wakes john up in the morning (not a good thing).  right now, there seem to be at least 4 dogs over there.  i think she dogsits for friends.  there is one that looks like a beagle and another that looks like a  urlLink labradoodle  (have you seen these things?  it's a cross between a labrador and a poodle...go figure!)   i'm just sitting here trying to have a quiet evening...and all i hear is ruff, ruff, yelp, yap, yap, yap, arf, arf.

      being blonde and being in the computer industry, i found this quite hilarious!  ****************** A blonde girl enters a store that sells curtains. She tells the salesman: "I would like to buy a pink curtain the size of my computer screen." The surprised salesman replies: "But, madam, computers do not have curtains!!!!" And the blonde says:  ****************** "Hellllooooo, I've got windows!!!!!!!!!!!!" ******************

      i'm baaaacckkkk! what a wonderful, restful and relaxing vacation. though i didn't know how tiring doing nothing could be! i spent sunday floating around the lake on my raft, monday, john and i drove 70 miles north on route 1 through rockland, rockport, camden, belfast, ending in bucksport. it was a nice ride. we did the touristy thing too and went into boothbay harbor and damariscotta center to shop and made sure to eat at  urlLink moody's diner  in waldoboro known for their delicious pies. the weather was just ok. it rained one night pretty hard and another day on and off. rain and camping don't mix too well! we spent the rainy day playing monopoly with the neighbors...haven't played that in ages! all of the same families were back and we hung out with them every night at the campfire, telling stories, drinking beer and making s'mores...tried a new twist with those...instead of a hershey bar, use a reese's peanut butter cup...a bit messier, but just as yummy! we also befriended the family across from our site, who were really nice. they loved the campground and are planning to come back next year. we are too; put our $10 deposit down to reserve our site again. did i mention it is a waterfront site? we can now say that one week out of the year we have waterfront property!

      because saturday, i'm going on  urlLink vacation  *sticking tongue out at all of you who aren't on vacation*, ok that wasn't very nice.  i'm already dreading next sunday when i will be dreading going to work the next day...talk about rushing things!    you all don't know how much i'm looking forward to a week of r&r.  camping in a two-man tent with my best guy by my side, lakeside, sparking up the bbq every night, grilling burgers and dogs, roasting marshmallows, and drinking tall cold ones by the roaring campfire!  i can't wait to come back with my pores reeking with the sweet smell of the campfire!!!    so, if you are missing my posts (which i'm sure you will), look up at the sky and pick out a star...and know that i will be able to see them all in the dark skies of maine.

      six words i enjoy saying? six words i enjoy using in every day conversation? six words i enjoy looking at?  i'm just picking six random words in no particular order that i like for one reason or another.  i used to receive the word of the day from merriam-webster's site and try to use it in conversation that day.  usually, it would entail me telling someone about the word and its meaning.  i don't think that really counts as "using it in conversation".	  1. pulchritude - it just sounds robust but doesn't sound like it would mean pretty 2. preposterous - i seem to like "p" words 3. Gewurztraminer - a friend and i were arguing on the pronunciation of this one day.  turns out there are two ways to say it.  urlLink 1st way   urlLink 2nd way  4. beeeyaaatch! - has a really hard sound to it when said correctly, especially when yelled across a room full of people. 5. undulation - just rolls off the tongue.  6. maelstrom - new one...was in today's crossword puzzle.

      fat, flab, bulge, blubber, padding, winter insulation...whatever you want to call it...it sucks!  for as long as i can remember i have fought to lose weight.  i've done weight watchers many times and have managed to lose weight each time.  each time gaining it back.  my most successful attempt was my last one where i lost 25 lbs.  but along came the summer with its cookouts, concerts, parties and weddings.  i slowly saw half the weight that i lost creep back on.  it is a constant battle.    my mom was overweight and both my parents had diabetes...which you would think would be a great incentive for me to keep myself slim.  not to mention the closet full of clothes that i refuse to throw out!  but i guess not.  on a daily basis i say to myself, i'm going to eat better today and go to the gym.  and on a daily basis i fail.  i'm so sick of having to be so aware of what i'm eating and having to excercise.  why isn't there an easier way?  and i know it isn't just me, you get a group of women together and i can guarantee that at some point the discussion will veer towards weight, dieting and exercising.  i know that i feel and look better when i'm thinner.  i see pictures from the past and i think, damn, i looked pretty good!  and i do enjoy excercising.  it's just making the time for it.  my commute takes a lot of time away from me and totally sucks the life out of me.  by the time i get off of the train, i just want to go home.  i bypass the gym, literally (i drive by it on the way home).  i know these sound like excuses to you...and they are.  :)   well, for now, i gotta "love the flub" and deal with it.  i know what i have to do, it's just a matter of doing it!  i'll get there eventually, but on my own time, i guess.

       1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?  no, not really, i'm sure i had several in first grade.  but you are really too young to say, "this is my best friend".  but if i had to say, it was patti.   2. Are you still in touch with this person?  yes, still friends after 29 years.  though,  i'm sure there were times where we didn't see each all that much, but we still remained very close through those times.   3. Do you have a current close friend?  yes, patti and peggy have known me the longest and know all about my past, history, likes, dislikes, etc.  i feel i can tell them absolutely anything, (and i mean anything, just ask them), and i probably have told them just about everything! i have many friends though and don't really like to use the label "best".  they are all the best in different ways.   4. How did you become friends with this person?  patti through school, peggy through drumcorp.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?  hmmm, this is a good question.  once you are friends with me, you are pretty much friends with me for life.  you're just stuck with me!  there are people in my life that have faded away and would like to know how they are doing.  i feel life is too busy for everyone though to keep up sometimes.  i know that isn't a good excuse, but it is true!  i guess if i had to name someone...there was this one girl that i met when i was vacationing in florida when i was about 10 maybe...we hung out while in disney and she was really nice.  we signed each others mickey moust autograph books.  her name was beth.

      i associate with and know a lot of people. i have my high school crowd, my college bunch, friends from before-my-divorce life, my scrapbooking clique, drumcorp circle, business associates, weight watcher gang and lastly my relatives. i'm one of those people that when i first meet you and find out where you are from, i will immediately say, "do you know such-and-such..." sometimes they don't, but more often than not, they will know the person to whom i'm referring. it's just amazing to me how small the world is.   some examples: caroline, who was at my party the other day, bumped into her cousin there...who was my friend, peggy's husband, steve. now, i know caroline through john's friend, mike's wife, kathy. peggy's mom grew up with my mom. her aunt used to teach john in school. my friend angela's old boyfriend lived right next to john growing up. their families know each other well. also, one of her friends practically lives in my back yard!  john plays hockey with a guy who used to teach the drumcorp i was in when i was 10 years old! coincidences? isn't it mysterious how people in your life cross paths with one another? or do i just know too many people?

      i'm a little bummed.  john and i are going on vacation in a few weeks.  we are going camping in damariscotta, maine at lake pemaquid.  we are supposed to be going with kerry, mark and their kids.  well, i got a call today...they aren't going!  one of the only reasons john and i go, is because they are there and they make it a lot of fun.  they have been going to lake pemaquid for several years...staying on the same site, the same week of each year.  there are other families that do the same thing and everyone knows each other. two years ago, john and i went up for a weekend, just to check it out and hang out.  we enjoyed it so much that we booked a site across from them for the whole week for last year.  we had lots of fun, laughs, and made many memories.  this year, mark sold the camper and they were going to stay in a tent.  i guess he decided that he works too damned hard to have to sleep on the ground, make his own meals and make his own bed when he is on vacation.  he decided to rent a place down the cape for the family.  the people at lake pemaquid are going to be disappointed that they aren't there.  we will still go and have a lot of fun, but it won't be the same without them.

      phew! what a weekend!  i love long weekends, but after they are over, i need another long weekend to recuperate.  thursday night it was off to m. & k.'s house for a night of partying and celebrating the 4th.  there were fireworks involved but i had no desire to go and watch.  instead, i hung back at the house and drank silly!  needless to say, an unplanned stayover was involved.    i woke up the next day w/ a bag of cotton in my mouth and forced ourselves to get home and start getting the house ready for our party on the 5th.  but first, we had to make an appearance at my cousin's party.  we drove the bike there...the weather being what it was, made for a very pleasant ride over.  it was the first time j. has met any of my family besides my brothers.  it went well.  all of my aunts and cousins are nuts and love to have a good time.  the hosts of the party, my cousin k. and a., are in a band called the shemps, that were playing at the party.  she plays the tamborine, and her hubby is the singer.  they were really good and added a whole new dimension to the festivities.  saturday was the big day!  it was hazy, hot, and humid...a good mix for a pool party!  people showed up, threw down their belongings and headed straight for the pool.  i couldn't blame them, i was the hostess and was already cooling my ass off!  i'd say 75-80 people showed up, 1/3 of them kids!  the shallow end was full of children floating on noodles, wearing swimmies, screaming and splashing and enjoying the water.  the diving board and slide got a major workout.  flips, jacknives, and cannonballs came in rapid succesion off the diving board.  river country in my back yard!  it was great!  the sun beat down on us all day.  the smell of hamburgers and hot dogs wafted in the air.  much food was consumed...much alcohol was consumed...who can forget the alcoholic fruit salad (thanks b.!) or the frozen hurricanes?  slowly, the couples w/ children had to leave, followed by people with abnormal relationships with their dogs had to go home and let them out.  only the die hards remained (people w/out children or dogs).  the next round of food came out with the addition of sirloin tips.  late night cigars were passed around and it all ended with a fine display of fireworks!!  oh, and did i mention the late night skinny dip?  hee hee!  the party was a great success and a blast was had by all!!!  ahh, it was nice while it lasted...back to work tomorrow.  wow, i built it all up, just to bring it crashing down!

      i like to check out the daily picks on my yahoo! sometimes i will find a new interesting website.  today, i found this:  urlLink Colorworks  apparently there is a market for custom mixes of m&m's for special occasions.  i swear, anything can be sold these days!  you can get special mixes that show your school spirit, wedding hues, or corporate colors.  there are unique combinations for holidays; red, white and blue for 4th of july, black and orange for halloween or yellow, white and orange to represent candy corn or how about black, green and red for kwaanza!  there are 21 colors of m&m's to choose from!  all 21 colors are shown at the top of the page and when you do a mouse over, each one plays a note, like piano keys.  a neat feature, i guess, for some people.  i'm sure the market isn't huge, so now what i want to know, are there people hand picking all these m&m's for these special occasions?  good thing they don't melt in your hands!

      what a beautiful day it was on sunday...a great day for a motorcycle ride!  we participated in a poker run which was a fundraiser in memory of my friend's dad who was killed in a motorcycle accident 10 years ago.  this was my 5th year participating.   the ride started in halifax where you chose the first card of your poker hand.  john's motorcycle club, the south shore hogs, drove together as a pack.  there were about 31 bikes in our group.  the purr of harley engines and the roar of  pipes were heard throughout the route, which was a gorgeous one, with three stops along the way to pick your 2nd, 3rd, and 4th card of your poker hand.  it took 4 hours to complete and rolled through towns such as wareham, middleboro, matapoisett, bridgewater, rochester, and marion ending in plympton where you drew your final card.  there was an abundance of beautiful scenery to admire and lots of fresh country air to breathe.    there were also some hairy moments along the ride. one bike's choke cable snapped and another bike got a flat tire.  you must also understand that being on a bike, you have to watch out for everyone else around you!  take the case of the lunatic lady.  at every intersection, a "block" is set up; this is when bikes block oncoming traffic so that all of the bikes can pass through together as a group.  at one intersection, this lunatic lady tried to cut in to the middle of the pack.  there wasn't any room for her, and practically ran over the blocker! blockers get VERY defensive if you try and do something like that.    even though there were a few mishaps, the ride was a success!  at the end of it, there was a huge party that included an awesome meal of barbecue chicken, corn on the cob, and a baked potato, a band, and lots of bike games.  melis, may your dad always be in your heart forever. amen.

      yes, we had another summer bash at the house!  over 55 family members attended.  everyone consumed some beverages and great cuisine, took a dip in the pool and had tons o'fun!    it was great to catch up with my aunts and cousins.  our side of the family doesn't see each other all that often, unfortunately.  usually at the occasional wedding or funeral.  john's family, on the other hand, is very close.  they have a christmas eve tradition of getting the family together.  my family used to be closer when my mom was around.  she was one of five sisters and had a brother too, but she was the genuine glue.  when she passed away, the glue dried up and withered away with her.  we used to go over my aunt dottie's house every weekend and i would stay at her house for two weeks every summer.  when my mom passed away, it seemed my relatives fell off the face of the earth...or maybe i did?  too long of a story to go into right now.   anyway, i hate to admit it, but it seems like life just gets in the way and you lose track of time.  people have their own lives going on, taking care of their families, working a job or two, etc.  it's hard to find the time to get together.  i know that really isn't a good excuse, but it is all i can come up with.  i know the right answer is that the time should be made to see each other and keep in touch more often.  something we all have to work on.  anyway, my family is awesome and i love them very much, i hope they know that!!

      woo hoo!  sure let's have another round!  give me another beer! time for a shot!  what's that green drink?  give me one of those!  oh, and don't forget every fat-laden appetizer you have on the menu.  it is all so fun while you are in the midst of drinking your brains out with your friends...and then *skidding to a halt* it's time to wake up for work the next day!    i started thinking this morning, i'm not drinking like that anymore.  not that i drank all that much, but i can still feel it this morning...it's not a nice feeling either, it is a fuzzy, hazy, cotton-in-your-mouth kind of feeling.  nothing a greasy, egg and cheese sandwich smeared with ketchup from the local grease kitchen won't fix!  i'm hoping!

      i've been told that i'm apparently brutally honest.  at the wedding the other day, i quietly (quietly being the operative word) turned to peggy and told her she had a little whitehead on the side of her nose.  now, she is a very good friend and i feel that i can tell her this without any problem.  well, she turns around and tells everyone at the table what i just said.  now, i've become the bad guy, "how could you say that?", was exclaimed around the table.  i told peggy this information (remember from above, quietly), i did not announce it to the whole table....peggy decided to do that!  so, for the rest of the evening, the whitehead was pointed out to everyone (she apparently didn't feel the need to take care of it).  all sorts of other circumstances were brought up throughout the night of when i've told someone they had something on their face, a thread hanging from their shirt, toilet paper on their shoe, or had a boogey in their nose, etc. hell, if i had a boogey in my nose, i would hope one of my good friends would point (not pick) it out for me.

      well patti is now a married woman!  the ceremony went well, the reception went well, and everyone had a wonderful time!  food choices were lobster and steamers or steak and chicken...both were remarkable!  brendan was a novice at eating lobster and was coached the whole way through the dinner.  all of us of course felt it necessary to play with the lobster, brendan had it stuck to the side of his face using it as a phone, i was pretending to make it dance, and others were throwing miscellaneous lobster pieces everywhere.  the usual jokes about the poop in the lobster and so on.  the chicken and steak dish weren't as much fun to play with obviously!    the venue was a cute setup; outside, under tents, overlooking the water and a park across the way, one end was a large gazebo where the band, the infractions, played and dancing took place (or falling down as i was doing).  imbibing of alcoholic drinks took up a large part of the evening (may be the cause of my fall).  lots of pictures were taken (oh god, blackmail anyone?), i already have mine developed, of course.   even though it was a casual wedding (which made everyone comfy, cozy) everyone looked so nice, even kerry in her knock-off of the "laverne" shirt!  patti and kirk enjoyed the day, so it seemed.  they said they don't feel any "different".  wait until they move into the house together...there will be a lot of "different" going on then!!

      i was tending to my hanging plants on the front porch last night, when i found an unexpected surprise in the pot!  i was watering one of them when i noticed what looked like a clump of dry grass, leaves and miscellaneous stuff just thrown on top of the dirt.  i went to remove it and what did i find underneath it?  a bird's nest with 4 little eggs.  i have no clue what kind of bird eggs they might be.  they are fairly small and are mostly white with a bluish hue.   i have no idea if there is a mama bird in the area tending to them or not...i do hope so, though i haven't seen one around the plants.  but then again, i'm not home during the day, so there might very well be a mama bird protecting and caring for the eggs.  i returned the clump of grass to its original location and made it look untouched.   i'm hoping that they will hatch and the chicks will be ok!

      i'm very excited for the weekend!  one of my best friends, patti, is getting married!!  she is having a private ceremony for the immediate family on saturday and then a big 'ol casual shindig on sunday for everyone.  it's a veritable "wedding weekend"!    i am going to be at her side in the morning studying how our hairdresser does her hair so that i will be able to recreate it on sunday.  then kerry is doing her makeup.  she did a run through the other night and patti looked fabulous!  the ceremony is at 11:00 and i am to be the videographer.  i'm a girl wearing many hats tomorrow.  but, i don't mind.  i couldn't imagine not being involved in her wedding in some way...i've known the girl for 29 years!!  this is the biggest day of her life!  she is marrying kirk, who she has been with for 5 years now.  they also just bought a house.  talk about doing everything at once!  there is enough stress planning a wedding, never mind adding the purchase of a house to it!  i'm very happy for them though.  it will be the start of a new life together.   congratulations, patti & kirk...may you live happily ever after!  ok, i'm gonna start crying now...

      anyone remember that peter wolf song?  well, the big blackout of 2003 is upon us.  i'm at work, but our corporate headquarters are in detroit, so there are a few things that aren't quite working here.  it's pretty amazing how many people are without power across the u.s.  it was really whacked watching the news, seeing people walking down streets and over bridges to get out of the city, people stuck on the subway and in elevators...total flashbacks of september 11th.  they (whoever "they" are) have told us that terrorists had nothing to do with this...but how do they know that already?  they shouldn't say anything like that until they are absolutely sure of it.

      well, football season has begun!  woo hoo!  john and i went to the patriot's game last thursday night.  it was a lot of fun.  we decided to go last minute...so no tailgating this time, plus it is only pre-season.  we got to the stadium at 7:15 (the game started at 8), had two beers in the parking lot and headed in.  of course, it decided to start raining at this point.  we ended up spending more money than we wanted to on beer and food.  but it is all worth it...it can be a very entertaining time watching the antics of some of the other pats fans.  every time we score, there are high fives to go all around!  clapping, dancing, jumping, screaming, hollering...just a damn good time. we did have some giants fans on each side of us that tried to ignore us, but if you know my scream, that is pretty hard to do!   :)   my scream was responsible for getting my friend berna and her now husband, max, together at a patriots game 3 years ago!  if i wasn't making so much racket we might not have started talking to them.

       1. What are the 3 driving laws you see broken most often?  a) driving over the speed limit b) illegal parking, i.e. handicap spots, loading zones, fire hydrants c) not pulling over for fire engines etc.   2. What are 3 things that drive you nuts about other drivers?   a) drivers going too slow in the fast lane b) drivers on their cellphone and not paying attention to what they are doing c) drivers who spray their windshield washer fluid while you are right behind them   3. What are 3 things you do while driving that you shouldn't - or if you're a perfect driver, what are 3 things you think others shouldn't be doing while driving?   i'm certainly not a perfect driver as i'm sure many of my friends will attest to...so i guess these are my answers: a) try to read a map b) try to dial my phone c) zone out   Bonus: Have you ever experienced or seen a bad case of road rage?   not that i can think of off the top of my head.  just the usual flipping of the bird.   Bonus-Bonus: Are you a "backseat driver" when someone else is in the driver's seat? (like your significant other or a family member)   not so much.  maybe with some of my friends, but not with john.  i try not to pay attention to what is going on when others are driving!

      i'm feeling pretty good today.  i've been on an "eat better and exercise" route since sunday.  i've been weighing myself every day.  today my weight equals:  the number of u.s. states  + the most amount of points i can have in one day on weight watchers  + my favorite patriot's players jersey number  - the number of stops i have on the commuter rail to work  + the number of stops i have on the red line to work  + the pieces of jewelry i wear on a daily basis  + the number of playing cards in a deck  - my age  + my favorite radio station - minus the number of my house  see, a woman never tells you how much she weighs!

      i had the worst day of work today...nothing went right.  i couldn't dig myself out of the shithole of misery i lead myself into.  i got myself all worked up because no matter what i tried, the damn thing wouldn't do what it was supposed to do.  it was so bad, that i was literally reduced to tears!  have you ever been so frustrated that that you felt completely lost?  like you didn't even really know what you were doing in the first place?  it is an awful feeling!  when i really sat back and looked at it though, it is just a job...and somehow, someway, it will get figured out.  you know why?  because it has to.  that's it.  end of story.  period.

      tonight, i went to dinner with my ww friend, lianne, to a restaurant called, "haay fatty".  everything on the menu is either low-fat or no-fat.  all the nutritional values are listed and they even had the ww "points" on hand for all of their food.  i had a 9 point sweet potato pizza!  you don't know how big it is to have a WHOLE pizza for only NINE points!!!  it was tasty and very filling.  it consisted of a tomato puree type sauce, fat-free cheese, sweet potato, black beans and tomatoes on a thin wheat crust.  we also split some no-fat french fries.  they were baked with a little bit of spray oil and lots of herbs.  the owner of the place was very pleasant and recommended what he thought was worth trying.  he touted the pizzas with much enthusiasm.    we also discussed the peculiar name with him.  "why, haay fatty?"  he said he used to tease his mother, who also does ww, and it just came from that.  the store also sells clothing bearing the "haay fatty" name.  the kicker were the shorts and sweatpants with "fatty" plastered across the ass!  who is going to wear those??  not me!!

      john and i attended my cousin's wedding this past saturday.  i didn't know what i was going to wear because none of my clothes fit!  i was feeling down, so i went out and bought an outfit for the wedding.  it made me happier.  a pair of black pants and a light blue, glittery, flowy sleeved, sheer, shirt type thing.  i ended up being able to return the pants because i had a pair of black pants i could wear.    the glitter from the shirt ended up everywhere!  everyone i hugged had it on them, and then they transferred it to the people they hugged...so pretty much everyone at the wedding had glitter on them.  they still had it on them the next day at breakfast!  we had a lot of fun at the wedding, danced, ate, and drank!  we ended up partying until 4am with my cousins.  a bunch of 30 and 40 somethings, sitting in a hotel room, trying to find food at 2am, still drinking, smoking pot, talking about silly things, and having a complete ball!  by 4am, i was done.  my brother was supposed to stay in our room, so i gave him a key and left.  i guess i forgot to mention one important piece of information...our room number!  the front desk wouldn't give them my room number, so they called and left a message at 5am...we were out cold and didn't hear the phone.  they tried to find our room by roaming the halls calling my name...no answer from me.  so, he ended up staying with my cousins...slept in his suit, tie and all!!

      my real name is Lois for those of you who don't know me.  a "Lois Club" actually exists, believe it or not, and i of course belong to it.  most of the chapters are out of canada and most of the Loises are a lot older than me.  newsletters are sent out during the year that include interesting "Lois" tidbits, articles about Loises, and cruises and trips that are planned just for people named Lois!  here are some interesting tidbits from the most recent newsletter:  1) there are two Lois wines - St. Lois red and white wine is made by Penglai City HauLu Wine Co. Ltd. in Penglai City, China.  Lois Wine distributed by Vin Divinio.  2) in 1927, Lois Eleanor Delander was crowned Miss America.  3) there is a variety of a sweet pea called Lois  4) a birth announcement in Vernon, CT, for a newborn Lois.  (i find it strange to name a baby Lois because it is such an "old" name.  according to the U.S. Social Security records, Lois was the 21st most popular name through the '20's, staying strong through the 30's at 24th place, slipping to 49th in the 40's, 119th in the 50's, 236th in the 60's, 600th in the 70's and then off the Top Thousand.)  5) Lois jeans, blouses, shirts, and shorts - only distributed in Canada. (when i went to Canada years ago, i saw billboards all over the place for these jeans...pretty cool!)  6) new and rare resident at the Victoria Bug Zoo - Lois the macrolyristes corporalis or bush cricket from the jungles of South East Asia.  she is one of the largest insects in the world. (hmmm...maybe that is where i inherited my large frame?)  so remember, it is  LOIS , not Louis, not Lewis, not Louise...

      had a great time at the patriots game today, though i think they played like shit...at least they won!  jets suck!  (i really dislike the jets)  it was really all about the tailgating anyway...it was a beautiful, sunny day.  brought the veggie burgers like i said i was going to.  they were good!  as was the cheesburger, oh and the potato chips, and um, yup, the beers were pretty tasty too, oh, and the tortilla wraps i made, those were scrumptious, the munchkins the guys brought...yummy, the bagel and cream cheese, very appetizing...did i mention that the beers were tasty?    ww pts. for the day = lost count somewhere around the 3rd donut hole that i was shoving down my gullet and the 4th beer that went gushing down my throat.

      this is it...i'm done with having flab hanging off of my body.  i have started following the weight watchers program again...on my own though.  i can't justify spending the money on something i already know how to do.  i would spend money on someone to do it for me though.  i saw a program last weekend on vh1, where they took 4 women and gave them personal trainers and personal chefs just like the rock and roll stars have.  they each lost 20-25 lbs. in three months.  they worked out twice a day and were on a very strict diet of 1300 calories.  i think if i had someone pushing me 24/7 i could lose the weight too.  sign me up for the next program!    i have at least 20 lbs. + to lose!  i've done great this week...but of course it is only the first week.  i'm trying to be optimistic and telling myself that it is a start.  i've actually gone to the gym three times this week too!!  i used to go almost every day at 5am before work.  that was nice because i could get it out of the way and had the evenings to myself.  now i have to go after work because of my commute.  during the week i do very well...it's the weekends that are very hard.  for example, this weekend, i am going to a party on saturday and the patriots game on sunday!  lots of food and beer to be consumed.  i'm going to try my best not to lose control...i actually plan on bringing veggie burgers to grill on sunday!    i know i can do this...this time (how many times have i said that, i know)  i don't want to be overweight anymore...it is very uncomfortable...and i have a great "skinny" wardrobe waiting for me in my closet!

       1. Is the name you have now the same name that's on your birth certificate? If not, what's changed?  Yes, it is.  Though the last name has been tampered with...once for marriage and then back to the original after the divorce :)   2. If you could change your name (first, middle and/or last), what would it be?  I wouldn't change my name, but I always thought the name Penelope was cute...have no idea why.   3. Why were you named what you were? (Is there a story behind it? Who specifically was responsible for naming you?)  I was named after my aunt...my mom's sister.  I believe the story has to do with the fact that my aunt had 4 boys and always wanted a girl, but never got one.   4. Are there any names you really hate or love? What are they and why?  I seem to love "B" names, Brittany, Brianna, Breann, Bethany.  I like Alexis, Hannah and Meredith.  Michael is my all time favorite boys name.  I don't really like the overused names...Lisa, Timothy, Paul, etc.   5. Is the analysis of your name at kabalarians.com accurate? How or how isn't it?   Here is the analysis: "Your name of Lois has created a practical, responsible, stable nature, and you desire to direct the efforts of others rather than to take order or ask permission. You have a determined, self-reliant, capable nature and resent any interference, although in your desire to help you are inclined to become involved in the lives and decisions of other people. You like to make your own decisions and to be the master of your domain. You feel a limitation in your own expression when it is necessary to reach another through tact and understanding. Although you are honest and fair, a directness in speech is a source of much consternation to you, and you often regret what you say. You also have a tendency to worry. It causes you to be too serious, and interferes with happiness and relaxation that comes with naturalness of expression."  most of this is right on...i'm definitely a director, take charge kind of gal and i get involved with people's lives, sometimes too much and sometimes with people that i don't even know!  i think am tactful most of the time...there are times that i just say things the wrong way.  i also have more than a just a tendency to worry.

      john is obsessed with our lawn.  now this isn't a bad thing, i just find it slighty amusing how guys through themselves into yard stuff.  what started all this is seeing a friend's lawn that was immaculately beautiful and knowing that was how he wanted his (our) lawn to look.  his friend let him borrow his "lawn bible" to get him started.  john ended up going out to buy that book and two others.  he probably has never studied so much for a test in all his life!  his friend told him it took 5 years to get the lawn looking like it does.    so starts year one for us :)  last weekend he mowed the lawn really short, then he rented a dethatcher to dethatch the lawn.  then he raked up all the thatch.  thatch...all the debris that accumulates in your grass.  tomorrow, several cubic yards of loam will be delivered.  this weekend's schedule consists of renting and aerator to aerate the lawn.  this is a machine that pokes big holes all over the place.  then seeding, loaming and more seeding.  he even took some vacation days from work to do this!  he is focused i tell ya!   this leads to my john deere story.  john bought a john deere lawn mower.  *grunt* *grunt* *grunt* (in tim allen style of the home improvement show).  the shop sent john a very nice, green, john deere baseball hat.  embroidered on the back is "nothing runs like a deere" and on the front it says john deere with the signature leaping deere.  john loves it!  wears it all the time.  while he was away on business this week in new jersey...two guys, two, not one, but two actually stopped him to admire "the hat" and tell him how awesome it was and that apparently you can't buy them anywhere.  you have to have bought a john deere product.  i find this rather funny that there are grown men out there that know this fact.  who knew that they weren't for sale!!  so, i went on ebay to see if there were any there...yup, there is a black market for john deere hats!

      today is september 11th, 2003. two years have passed since terrorists attacked america.  that was the most surreal day in my life and i'm sure yours too.  it is a day that every person in the u.s. will never forget.    i remember hearing about the first plane crashing into one of the towers on the radio while driving to work.  i thought it was a severe case of pilot error.  when i arrived at work, we gathered around the television and watched the planes hit the world trade center towers over and over again, not knowing yet that each plane carried one of our fellow employees, we watched as the pentagon was hit, we watched mesmerized by the dreamlike sequence of pictures that passed over the screen.  we watched in disbelief as the colossal towers fell and turned into a pile of indistinguishable rubble.  we incredulously watched as people leapt to their deaths from the soaring buildings, knowing there was no hope left.  on this day of remembrance and reflection, i just want to express my deepest sympathies to everyone who lost a loved one on that fateful day.  i believe there are no words in the english language to express the sadness you have all experienced.  i can't even imagine what or how you feel.  i only hope that you can carry on, knowing that your lost loved one would want you to.  let's pray that nothing of that magnitude ever happens again on american soil.

      a sampling of my thoughts during my commute:  that lady sits in the same seat every friggin' day...is she fat or pregnant...she must be pregnant...her stomach sticks out waaaay too far...well, the day she isn't sitting in that seat...i will know that she was pregnant...then i will steal her seat!  mmm, coffee!  i feel like a real commuter drinking my coffee on the train...oops, dammit...spilled it, what a moron i am!  thank god, i have napkins today.  brandy, your a fine girl!  what a good wife you would be!  ok, tina and doug's dog's name is brandy...i have to call tina tonight, i forgot to last night.   that guy has huge headphones on!  i wonder what song he is listening to.  why does he need them?  does it make the music sound better?  really...they look stupid.  on to the red line...yippee!  ok, people, let the people off of the train first!  try not to touch any of the poles. you never know who has touched them before you.  then again, you never know who sat in the seat before you!  i hope it wasn't a dirty bum.  is that an mp3 player?  i've never seen little cds like that.  hmmmm!  the woman's perfume next to me smells awful. and she has an awful outfit on.  yikes, that woman has black eyebrows and red hair, and those glasses are HUGE!    ok, stop talking about people, you aren't perfect either.  i think i at least look normal...i don't look like a complete psycho!  what is normal though, really?  go ahead, pass me, i'm not walking fast enough for you?  why is he stopping so suddenly?  oops, he has lost or forgotten something...he's freaking!  i would, i hate that feeling.  oh god, why must that old man wear those way too short, way too revealing, running shorts...and he's not even running?  why must people try to cross the street when the light is green?  that guy is carrying two sandwiches made on what looks like hamburger rolls, weird.  oh great, another day at work...whoppee! at least i have lunch to look forward to, house of blues.  can't believe it is closing down in 4 days :(  that is my daily commuting routine...sounds like fun, huh?

      i was in a foul mood this morning...the usual stuff was bothering me; my weight, my job, having no money.  john managed to get me out of the funk though...he always does.  i came home from work and chowed on some dinner and sat on the couch :)  while i was fixing myself some dinner, i heard some scuffling above my head.  i think there is some sort of animal in the ceiling in the kitchen.  of course, when i called john in to check it out, not a peep was made.  later tonight, after john left for hockey, i heard it again... a lot!  it was like this thing was having a party up there or something.  i'm hoping it is trying to find its way out!  i've been reading some other people's blogs and it seems that theirs are way more interesting, witty, and better written than mine.  i really wish i could write like some of these people.  my blog tends to just be a regurgitation of what is on my mind at the time.  sometimes, i try to make it funny...but it is really only funny to the people that know me.  though i was wallowing in my misery earlier...i do know things could be worse.  i saw a guy on the "t" the other day who had apparently been badly burned.  he had his hand, or what was left of it, (it may even have been amputated by the looks of it), bandaged up.  he was sporting a bandana and you could see that his skin was burned on his face.  all i could think about to myself is how we take so many things in life for granted.  it takes seeing a person who is worse off than you, to make you realize that sometimes.  we worry about being late to a movie, or how are we going to save enough money to go on vacation.  we are always rushing here, there and everywhere.  this poor guy has to figure out how to use one hand to do things he used to do with two!  he has a lot more obstacles in his way and a lot more to worry about than being late for an appointment.  chloe, our cat (i'll have to add her to the cast of characters), is lounging on the floor in front of me.  she doesn't seem to have too much on her mind.  she is staring at her paw for no apparent reason.  i wish she could go catch whatever is scurrying around in the ceiling.  she is a good cat.  she has caught two moths for me.  she seems to enjoy chasing after them and it puts me in a fit of hysterics!  i think everyone should have some sort of pet to entertain them.  though, if you ask john, a dog wouldn't be his pet of choice.  i'm off to yet another cookout tomorrow. this one is at liz's (one of my faithful readers).  we were also supposed to go to one of john's friend's cookouts too...but he bagged it.  he is concentrating on the lawn...he is going to dethatch, we have several cubic yards of loam being delivered and god knows what else!  i'm not complaining though...i love a beautiful lawn!  this entry was a bit of babbling...hey, i'm home on a friday night, what do you expect?

      yes, tonight is the first game of the nfl season!  woo hoo!  jets vs. redskins.  i hate the jets, so i'm rooting for the redskins.  i'm also participating in a football fantasy league this year.  i played last year too.  i'm the only girl playing!  i don't really know any of the players on my team...i sometimes think that is best.  at least it makes the season fun!  i'm very disappointed in my pats...cutting lawyer milloy the way they did.  that really sucks!  he was such a good team player!  i think they all make way too much money as it is, but i'm not the one creating their salaries.  well, now he is in buffalo and that should make sundays game even more interesting!

      i'm back!  i hope everyone had a wonderful labor day weekend...the unofficial end to summer :(  it was a busy weekend for me!  the wedding:  it was held at the scituate country club.  john's friend was getting married.  it was a very nice, small, emotional ceremony.  the bride's daughter, from a previous marriage, wrote and sang a song for her mom.  it was so touching!! i was bawling my eyes out!    jimmy buffett:  had a beer, drank, drank some more, ate some food, had a shot, another beer, a hurricane, a margarita, oh, and some more shots!  i'm not a huge buffett fan to begin with, so i thought the concert was just alright.  the parking lot though?  that was a blast!  people had all sorts of outrageous setups; sailboats, sharks, bars, drinking games, even a "spin-the-wheel" game which was VERY interesting.  some of the things listed on the wheel to do were, flash a moon, kiss someone of the same sex, do a body shot, and strip down to your underwear!!  the police came by and shut them down because there was some law that stated that you "couldn't draw a crowd"!  it was good while it lasted.  we mostly played the fishing game next to us, which was fashioned after an actual children's game!  you had to use a homemade fishing pole to catch a fish in a little kiddie pool.  each fish had a color marked on the bottom that coincided with a specific shot, tequila, kamikaze, butter shot or shnapps.  deutsche bank championship held at tpc boston:  i'm not a fan of golf, but i really enjoyed this!  we didn't get there until around 1:30 or so (we had wanted to get there earlier, but we had to recuperate from buffett).  we walked around to catch a bit of all the holes being played.  we got to watch tiger woods play the 16th  hole which was a par 3.  after he teed off he walked right by us...pretty cool!  some of my favorite players to watch were rocco mediate, greg norman and vijay singh.  it is amazing to see these guys slam the ball!  that is my weekend in a nutshell!  today it is back to work and the only thing getting me through it is knowing that this is a short week!

      i don't care how much i love my cellphone, i wouldn't do this.     New York - A man riding a Metro-North train dropped his cell phone in a toilet and got his arm stuck trying to retrieve it Thursday, forcing the train to stop and delaying the evening commute for thousands of people.     urlLink full story

      between falling down the stairs and getting a cold...this has been a hell of week at work too.  we received bad news.  our company isn’t doing too well, but then again what company is?  instead of layoffs though, we will get through this hard time by cutting salaries and taking away benefits...our ceo is taking a pay cut, employees with salaries above $200,000 will be struck with a 10% salary reduction and employees who make more than $60,000 will have 5% slashed off the top.  we are now asked to pay for our own health care and the tuition reimbursement benefit has been taken away.  holiday parties – cancelled, annual holiday gift of cashews – cancelled.  the good news?  we receive another holiday...we will get december 24th off, bringing our holidays up to a grand total of 7 days per year!

      this is probably the first halloween that i haven't had any plans!  we are just going to go over a friend's house, pass out candy and have a few cocktails.  i did make a kitty litter cake for work today.   who knows if anyone will actually eat it though!

      so, i leave work and take the red line train to south station yesterday.  i always try to get an end seat near the door.  i will give it up for an elderly or pregnant person though.  at park street, a man gets on and stands at the pole next to me.  i look briefly and see that his shirt is dirty...i immediately think, oh he's a painter or something to that extent.  then all of a sudden, this stank that i've never smelled ever in my life, took over the whole train.  i didn't dare look next to me, for i knew it was emminating of this man, who i now know is not covered in paint.  it was really sad, he was wearing piss and shit laden pants!  the stench was intolerable.  i got off the train at downtown crossing and moved to the next car, as did several other passengers in the vicinity.  it is really very sad.  instead of me thinking about how this man is homeless, i started thinking about how did he get on the train?  did he pay?  i may have touched his money!  i'm a beeyatch, aren't i?

      literally!  this is going to be a short entry since i can't sit for too long.  friday night, in a drunken stooper, i fell down a flight of stairs and landed smack dab on my tailbone it seems.  ok, rewind...after a night of drinking (lots of raspberry stoli), we stayed over berna & max's, because driving home wasn't an option.  they just moved into a new house, therefore i'm unfamiliar with the layout.  in the middle of the night i had to go to the bathroom and was disoriented.  i fell down the stairs instead of going upstairs to the bathroom...ok, play...  the pain is excruciating, it is a take-my-breath-away type of pain.  after talking to nurse jeanne, i decided not to waste my day at the emergency room.  apparently, there is nothing they can do for an injured tailbone.  i have to just deal with it.  she said it could be sore for 2 months!  are you shitting me?  it's amazing how may things i've taken for granted in just one day; walking, sitting, laying down, going to the damn bathroom!!  i plan on going to the dr. on monday, maybe he can give me some percocet!  signing off...now where is that damn ice pack? aaaahhhhhh!

      i'm a sucker for hosting  urlLink home parties .  let's see, aloette cosmetics, tupperware, creative memories scrapbooking, partylite candles, undercoverwear, petra fashions, pampered chef, longaberger baskets, mary kay cosmetics...you name it, i've hosted it.  i'm very keen on the social and free product aspects of these parties.  i don't pressure people to buy anything, i don't pressure them to host their own party.  i just like to have parties, doesn't matter what they are for.  the incentive of hosting them are having your friends over to socialize and have a few laughs; they get to see new products and buy things they may or may not need and a chance to book their own party.  i can earn free product from the sales and bookings.  the bookings are a double-edged sword though.  the more bookings, the more free product i can receive...and the more parties i have to attend.  i went to three tupperware parties, because i felt obligated to go to the party that was hosted off of my party and so on and so on.  it can be a never ending chain!    but i had my last home party ever last night.  i'm done with them..that's it, no more.  it was a partylite candle party.  this is one of the only home parties i really enjoy because i love candles and the product is excellent. it isn't a half-assededly manufactured product.  and everyone can always use candles.  god, if i had a nickel for all the things i've bought from tupperware and pampered chef, that i thought were cool at the time, and have never used, i'd be pretty well-off!  maybe i'll just go on "party hiatus".  i can't just swear them off all together, can i?  i'll see how it goes.  so, peggy, i probably will not book a tastefully simple party from yours.  just wanted to warn you ;)

      i'm completely anal about my e-mail.  i have an insane routine of reading, filing and deleting things as quickly as possible.  as soon as a message is received, it must immediately be read, replied to and then either deleted or filed in an archive.  then, the sent e-mail is deleted or filed and then the deleted e-mails must be emptied.  i also have the "request a read receipt for all messages i send" option on.  i need to know if and when the message was read.  i have a rule set up to file the receipts in a special "message read" folder.  once i know they have been read, i delete the receipt messages and again, dump the deleted message folder. so, basically, the sent items, message received and deleted items folders must all be empty!!   the list of messages in my inbox can never go beyond one screen, i just can't stand that.  in my line of work, i see e-mails in people's inbox that scroll 3-4 screens!  i don't know how someone can work in that environment!  at our company the inbox limit is 50 mb.  that seems reasonable to me.  i am currently using 2 mb.  but there are a few people that consistently hover at the 50 mb mark.  that means they cannot send emails until they are below that mark.  if they only kept up with my routine, they would never encounter that problem!  don't even get me started on the people who have icons willy-nilly all over their desktop...ok, i'm having an anxiety attack just thinking about it!  *take a breath*

      more women than ever are watching football and becoming avid fans.  according to the nfl, 43% of their fan base is made up of women.  clinics, like the one i attended last night at gillette stadium, are held at other major stadiums to encourage even more women to attend and experience the game of football.   the clinic was taught by three patriot alums:   linebacker andre tippett  played for the patriots from 1982-1993.  he was inducted into the patriots hall of in 1999, played 12 seasons for the patriots and holds the team record of 100 sacks. he is also a  5 time pro bowler.   quaterback steve grogan  played for the patriots from 1975-1990.  he is the patriots' all-time career passing leader with 3,593 attempts 1,879 completions, 26,886 yards and 182 touchdowns.   linebacker steve nelson  played for the patriots from 1974-1987. he was inducted into the patriots hall of fame in 1993 and is a 3 time pro bowler.  he recorded over 100 tackles 9 times during his career, and finished with 1,776 tackles, and average of 10.2 per game.   the clinic was set up like a mini-football game.  a clock counted down the time left until the start of the clinic while an autograph session took place and we were fed.  then each quarter was broken down into learning the basics of the history of the game, offense, defense, special teams, penalties, signals, and scoring.  they made it interactive by letting us ask questions and using volunteers to illustrate the positions used in both the offense and defense.  after the learning element of the evening, we were taken on a tour of the stadium which was very cool!  we were able to walk through the empty stadium, go down on the field, see the workout room and best of all tour the locker room!  they wouldn't let us take pictures in the locker room, which is very understandable.  as it was, i felt it was an invasion of privacy.  the lockers are more like open closets.  you could see their uniforms, equipment, mouthwash, deodorant, pictures of their wives and children.  it felt like we were walking through a museum of sorts.  still cool though!  unfortunately, there weren't any current patriots players hanging around :(

      waking up late, chloe joining me for my nap, spending the day watching movies and football, john being flat out in his cushy chair, me in my comfy, cozy pjs, not taking a shower, ordering pizza to be delivered, my belly being full of said pizza, reaching couch potato status!

      i better start packing up that case of sam adams to ship out to long island to pay off my  urlLink bet .  it is a sad state of affairs here in boston.  i'm not going to dwell on the heartache here though because you can pick up any paper and read it there or turn on any news channel and hear about it.  john is on his way home from ny.  he didn't end up getting tickets, but watched it at the espn zone.  he actually made friends with some yankee guys that he said were cool.  "cool yankee fans"?  can you use cool in the same sentence as yankee fans?  oh well, the important thing is he is safe...very hungover, but safe.    until next year...

      between us and my avid yankee fan friends on long island:  sox win - they send me a case of  urlLink pennant ale brewed by the brooklyn brewery  (how apropos).  spanks win - i send them a case of sam adams beer.  at this moment, my johnny is off to ny to see the game!  he has friends in high places.  i kissed him and told him to be careful and keep his big mouth (which tends to sometimes get him in trouble) shut!  GO RED SOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Describe your eating habits at mealtime. Do you think you need to change them in order to lose weight and get healthy? Where do you usually eat? Health experts are telling us not to eat in front of TV. Why?   ~dread~ discuss my eating habits!  ugh! i can sum it up in four words.  I LOVE TO EAT.  i just love the taste of things.  i often say, if someone could invent tablets or losenges that taste like lasagna, peanut butter, ice cream and all good things i love, then i would be all set.  no fat, no calories.  i'm all about the taste, not the texture.  i sometimes eat whatever i want, whenever i want.  then the regret comes and i think, "oh, i shouldn't have eaten that".  hindsight is twenty-twenty.  i know i should eat a lot more from the fruit and vegetable part of the pyramid.  when i was on weight watchers, i was insanely obedient about eating healthy, drinking more than enough water and exercising religiously.  i don't know what has happened...i know what to do, but i just can't seem to get in the mindset to just do it (thanks nike)!  i usually eat at the counter for breakfast, my desk for lunch, and in front of the tv for dinner.  all no-no's, i know.  i don't know why health experts are telling us not to eat in front of the tv.  supposedly, it tricks our minds into thinking we haven't eaten because we were focused on the tv and not on what we are eating.  to me that is a crock!  i feel that the tv distracts me from my eating, so i eat slower than i would if i weren't watching it!!  it works for me!

      phew, what a weekend!  as if saturday night's festivities weren't enough for me.  we went to a party on saturday afternoon which lasted late into the evening.  the party was interrupted by the watching of the red sox game.    what a zany game!  who would have thought zimmer, a portly 72 year old man would attempt to smack martinez, a svelte 32 year old.  i believe pedro was acting in self defense.  if i saw that stay-puff looking, jowly man, stampeding towards me, i would have done the same thing pedro did!  the melee continued in the 9th inning when the yankees bullpen beat up a fenway park groundskeeper!  he even had cleat marks on him!  my avid-yankee-fanatic-friends, carolyn and her husband rob, (the seating cards at their wedding were replicas of a yankee ticket) called and left a message:  "this message is for pedro martinez, this is roger clemens.  why the hell are you going after a defenseless 72 year old man?"  i laughed...we have this on-going banter after each game.  oh, and did i mention my new halloween costume?  i'm going to apply a teeny, little band-aid to the bridge of my nose and be don zimmer!  i ended up passing out on the couch, not from drinking, but from exhaustion.  i woke up in the middle of the night and was all confused as to where i was (that is such an awful feeling).  we hadn't planned on staying over...though i think every time we go to mike & kathy's house we end up staying over.  john and mike were going to the patriot's game on sunday.  we didn't get home until 9:30am, so john had to rush around and get ready so he could go tailgating.  have to keep the party going, right?  i'm glad i gave up my ticket because it poured all day!  i stayed home and watched the matrix for the first time.

      i'm sitting here writing this with an aching head.  last night the girls went out for some fun.  me, patti, barbara, dawn and liz.  dawn picked me up in her hip-hop happening boots and abercrombie & finch jeans.  yes, that is what she called them.  (hey give her a break, she's trying to keep up with the times and hip with the styles while being a mom to two little boys.)  our saying for the night was "35 is the new 25".  did i get that right, liz?    the night started off at the eaglebrook with dinner and drinks.  we imbibed many cocktails, so we were primed when we got to our next destination...the funway.  being 25, we fit right in.  the very nice "older" woman at the door tipped us off that we could sit on the restaurant side and drink instead of going to the bar side and paying $7.  hmmm, she isn't very good for business.  the chad lamarsh band was playing.  liz and i got on the dance floor but were burnt when chad announced, "hey, we don't have any dancers on the floor."  liz and i looked at each other...what are we chopped liver?  anyway, that didn't stop us!  we continued to dance anyway.  liz stepped on a few guy's feet and we would end up chatting with them a bit...better than a pick up line, liz!  liz had the great idea to do a shot or two or three!  ouch!    our conversations throughout the evening were very fascinating.  we so innocently started reminiscing about the good old days of high school.  who was with who, why we went with who we did, reminding each other who we were with, the crazy things we used to do, how are parents never caught us, and how the police sometimes did.  then our conversation took a tragic turn when we were confabulating (fantabulous word) about which csi we liked better; las vegas or miami.  i was saying how i think grissom is adorable and and horatio on the miami one is heinous.  the las vegas cast is much better looking so much so, that i would even do the women!  "did i just say that out loud"?  anyway, from there it was all down hill, discussions about threesomes, swingers and if we could get picked up at a gay bar.  no idea where all that came from, but we were laughing so hard our sides hurt and tears were pouring down our faces.  we had a lot of fun and it is great that we still get together every so often.  see you gals the night before thanksgiving!!  *make sure to check out the comments, because i'm sure the girls will  add bits and pieces of the night that i may have conveniently forgot!

      every morning i follow the same exact routine...wake up at 5:20am, take a shower, iron my clothes, blow dry my hair, get dressed, curl my hair, put on makeup, eat breakfast, brush my teeth, and i'm out the door.  all of this within 55 minutes.  now, as soon as i get in the car, i start thinking, "did i turn off the iron?", "did i turn off the curling iron?"  sometimes, if i have the time, i will go back in the house and check.  but, for the last two days, i've been running late, so i called john from the train and had him check.  both times, everything had been turned off and unplugged.  i hate that i second guess myself all the time.  i've been doing this routine so long it has become second nature to turn off and unplug everything.  this is a good thing though because i certainly don't want to burn down the house!   do you ever 2nd guess yourself?

       1. Do you watch sports? If so, which ones?  Absolutely!  football, my first love. baseball and hockey are tied for 2nd.     2. What/who are your favorite sports teams and/or favorite athletes? ?  i'm from boston, so obviously, patriots, red sox and bruins.  i also enjoy watching  the dolphins play.  willie mcginest is one of my favorite athletes.  my all time favorite growing up was mike krushelnyski.  he was so cute!  my bedroom wall was a shrine to him and the bruins.  certain events during the summer and winter olympics are fun to watch too.   3. Are there any sports you hate? ?  i could care less about basketball.  it bores me, as does golf.  i need action!   4. Have you ever been to a sports event? ?  too many to name!  i have season tickets to the patriots, so i go to all of the home games.   5. Do/did you play any sports (in school or other)? How long did you play? ?  i played soccer my senior year of high school.  unfortunately, i pulled a ligament half way through the season and was unable to play for the rest of the year.  i ended up in a cast from my thigh to my ankle.  being on crutches proved to be a benefit because i could leave class early to get to the next one.  my fellow soccer teammates would take turns carrying my books, so it was good for them too!  oh, and i was on the all-star basketball team in 6th grade.  does that count?

      saturday morning cartoons   Onesome:   Saturday-Is Saturday a day to relax, maybe do something fun, or is it a day spent on the run, chauffeuring kids to activities, yourself to the gym and getting the errands done before it's back to work on Monday? Do you need a day off to rest from your day off? Tell us about your day!  saturday is a day to do whatever i want!  my routine usually consists of:  get up early go to the gym get my dunkin donuts coffee have a little breakfast a little cleaning  hopefully, i finish all that by noon so that i have the afternoon and evening to hang with johnny or do some other special things.  i hate to waste the weekend on food shopping and errands, so i try to do all of that during the week.     Twosome:   Morning- What's different about your weekend morning routine than the other days of the week?   the only difference is that i don't mind getting up because i know i don't have to go to work!  i still get up fairly early, not as early as during the workweek, but around 7am.   Threesome:     Cartoons - Do you have a favourite one? Do you still watch it and/ or other cartoons?  no, and no.  if i had to pick a favorite one though it would probably be the simpsons.  i used to watch it religiously when i had more free time, but not anymore.  i do remember that when i was in elementary school i used to always watch mighty mouse before going to school.

      halloween is coming!  i used to be a huge fan of this holiday.  we would have a party every year in college.  some of my best costumes were a lobster, a prisoner (my id was 69-OU812, hee hee!), a spider, and the tin man (though everyone kept asking me if i was a silver box).  we would decorate with carved pumpkins, use dry ice to create fog, play scary music, and spider webs were draped all over.  it was always great fun!    now that i'm all grown up, i hand out candy to the little ones.  i don't know what kind of trick-or-treater traffic we will get in the new house.  there aren't a ton of houses in our little cul-de-sac and we are off of a main road.  this year will be our trial run, so we will see what happens.  in the meantime, check these sites out!   urlLink http://www.extremepumpkins.com/ - the puking pumpkin kills me!  urlLink http://lillywonka.com/lillyprojects/  - i love the little pumpkin tea lights!

      you are probably sick of hearing it, but   too   bad!   urlLink it's a book;   urlLink it's a movie;   urlLink  it's a song;   urlLink it's a line dance;   urlLink you can get it put on a t-shirt;  and most importantly, it's a millar quote, that has induced the players with motivation and convinced the fans to get excited.  straight from the horses mouth (no pun intended), "i want to see somebody cowboy up and stand behind this team and quit worrying about all the negative stuff".

      Would you rather:      Eat one live tarantula OR hold a live wasp in your mouth for one minute?   what is this fear factor?  ick to both, but i think the live wasp would be the better of the two choices.  if i keep my tongue very still, maybe it won't sting me!   Wake up unexpectedly in the hospital OR wake up unexpectedly in your neighborhood jail?   i think i would rather wake up unexpectedly in jail.  i'm sure whatever it was i did wrong would end up being a big misunderstanding and i'm sure one of my many friends would come bail me out.   Be caught walking nude on a beach by a policeman OR have your horn get stuck while your car is behind a gang of Hell's Angels?   well, i was once caught by a policeman peeing behind a building, so, i was caught half nude.  so i've already "been there, done that" pretty much.   Come home and have the feeling someone has been in your apartment, but nothing is missing OR have your apartment obviously ransacked, but nothing is missing?   i would rather come home and have the feeling someone has been in my apartment, but nothing is missing.  it would just be a feeling and not knowing that someone was actually there going through your stuff.  in the latter instance, knowing that someone was there violating your privacy would be totally intolerable to me.   Be trapped in a room full of enthusiastic preaching televangelists for eight hours OR in a room full of raucous circus clowns for the same amount of time?  i think i could deal with the circus clowns.  they would probably end up being quite entertaining.  i think if i were stuck with the televangelists for that long, i might shoot myself.

      woo-hoo, the red sox beat the athletics, fair and square!  it was an outrageous series, causing fans to bite all their nails off, including their toenails!  but, why, why, why, must fans celebrate in such an outrageous way?  why can't they grow up and act like adults? see what i mean by reading the articles below.    this story describes the actions of the  urlLink idiotic boston fans  after last nights win.  and   this one describes the antics of the  urlLink foolish umass students  after saturday nights game.  what is so fun about tipping cars over, throwing beer bottles all over the place and causing thousands of dollars of damage?  i don't get it!  what is wrong with the oakland fans taunting ortiz after johnny damon is escorted out of the park in an ambulance?    let's all just celebrate in an enjoyable way, let's be well-behaved and obedient and not destroy property, harm innocent bystanders and spoil the good time for everyone else!

Shannen Doherty - she really can't act.  she's a beeeyaatch too!  8. commercial:  any of them that you can't figure out what the hell they are advertising.  9. television sitcom:  i can't think of a damn one because if i don't like it, i don't watch it!  10. singer:  celine dion (i despise her)

      could the weekend have been any better for boston sports?  i don't think so.  i went to the charley horse to watch the red sox game saturday night with a couple of girlfriends.  the place was totally jam-packed, standing room only.  thankfully, we got a table right in front of 8 televisions...all which had the game on!  what a nail biter!  the emotional roller coaster that this team has put its fans on is completely out of control!  and we all went on the same roller coaster again on sunday!  we will all get in line for the ride again tonight!!   john and i were at the patriots game yesterday and i was hoping they would have the red sox game on one of the screens, but they didn't.  they did update the crowd with the score throughout the game though.  some people brought tiny little portable tvs to keep an eye on our boston boys. because of them, we usually received  the news before it was actually announced.  you could see the stadium react in waves as they saw damon's home run and ortiz's two run double.  gillette stadium was in a complete frenzy when it was announced that the reds sox had won!  you wouldn't even know that a football game was actually in progress. (oh, yes, the patriots won too!)  my sister-in-law went to the game saturday night.  she is an extreme fanatic.  when i called her on sunday morning to see how she was doing, i was told she went to church.  i'm like what?  my brother told me the story...apparently, she said a prayer for the red sox and said she would go to church if they won.  she only goes to church for weddings and funerals!  so, last night when i called her, i said, "are you going to church again tomorrow?"  she said, "i think i have to, there is a 5:45 mass before work!"    cowboy up, boys!

       1. What vehicle do you drive?  an infiniti G20   2. How long have you had it?   i have personally had it since 1999, the year of "the divorce".  but it is 10 years old.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   hmm, the coolest feature on a 10 year old car...the cd player?   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   well, i did a stupid thing one day...i backed the car up with the driver's side door open...the door hit a wall and was almost torn off the car.  now, the door squeaks piercingly every time i open or close it.   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   realistically, the toyota highlander, a volvo station wagon, or a cadillac escalade.  but money being no object, maybe something outrageous like an aston martin db7 gt, porsche 911 targa, or a lamborghini (i like their trademark bull).

      duran, duran, remember them?   they are playing on the radio right now!    "but I won't cry for yesterday  there's an ordinary world  somehow I have to find  and as I try to make my way to the ordinary world  I will learn to survive"  it's causing me to have major flashbacks.  i see several posters of the band pasted on dawn's bedroom wall.  the majority of them being of john taylor.  we each chose a band member and spent hours talking about how cute they were, how many kids we would have with him, where we would live, etc.  we used to cry while we watched the endless videos of them on mtv.  god, how old were we?   13-14?  geez!  so, i'll be looking for the "new moon on monday" while i watch the "union of the snake".  i ask that you please make sure to "save a prayer" for me while doing the "reflex". i will watch out for the "wild boys" while in "rio" and i won't "come undone" while watching "girls on film".  i might have some "careless memories" though about becoming "notorious".

      i forgot to mention how i fell asleep this morning on the train ride into town.  i usually take cat naps on the train, but that is about it.  Evidently, this morning i took a lion of a nap.  when i came out of my little snooze, i realized the train had arrived at its destination.  no one was on the train and no one was on the platform.  i was the last person off the damn train.  no one woke me up, not even the conductor!!!  what if i had continued sleeping?  maybe that might not have been so bad, i would have headed back home and not gone to work ;)

      what to write, hmmm...i'm in kind of a funk lately.  i keep thinking about what do i really want to do with my life? at 35, i'm not old, but i'm not getting any younger either.  i someday want to be married, have kids, go on family vacations and enjoy life.  right now, i feel stuck in my job, i'm not at my ideal weight and i suck at budgeting my money.  therefore,  catch 22s abound...none of the clothes i have fit me, but i can't buy any clothes, because i don't have the money.  i could make more money in a new position, but i'm too lazy to look for a new job; i couldn't look for a new job anyway because i don't have a suit that fits me for interviews, and i don't have the money to buy one and i wouldn't want to spend the money on one that is the size i am now anyway!  see how all of these things are connected?  money, job, weight?  on the other hand i have many things to be thankful for; a great boyfriend, family, friends, a roof over my head, lots of "things" that some people don't have, so i feel i shouldn't really be complaining.  i just have to be patient.  patience is something i so don't have.  i walk fast, i eat fast, i do everything fast!  i need to slow down and smell the roses.  that is what i'm going to concentrate on.  take a whiff!

      had a bunch of people over to watch the pats play the colts.  what a game!  i had a few heart attacks during the game.  i thought it was all wrapped up at half time, but the 3rd quarter was disastrous for the pats.  they managed to stop the colts in the final seconds from scoring which would have given, literally, handed them the win on a platter!  next week, they play miami and i'll be there cheering them on to another win giving them an 11-2 record.  oh yeah, and the company was great today...thanks guys!  i'd watch games with you any day!

       1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?  i love to shop.  i just wish i had more money to do it.  i especially like to shop for others.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?   the last thing i bought were two pair of shoes.  i got 2 for $25 which was a deal.   3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?   i like to shop online for certain things, but not clothes.  i have to try everything on.  anything else though, online, it saves me the hassle of going to the mall.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?   i think i did.  i really can't remember.  i know i did a lot of chores and helped around the house, so i'm sure i did.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?   i regret buying the 20th anniversary edition of trivial pursuit.  i had heard about it when it first came out and wanted it badly.  i heard that stores were running out of it, so when i saw it in this little hole-in-the-wall game store, i bought it...for $60!!!!  it retails for $30 and now it is on sale for half of that.  i'm a nitwit.

      i get into work and one of the server volumes is screaming "i'm full" (really, it does, it flashes every 15 seconds, on EVERYONE'S computer "blah blah blah is out of disk space"),  some people can't login, others can't get into their e-mail (god forbid), someone else is complaining that their connection speed is too slow (ok, all of those are related to the fact that the server is full) and another person's hard drive shit the bed (well, ok, that is a bit serious)!  and someone gets fired.  ugh!  it's thanksgiving week...how can i be thankful for anything after a morning like that?!  really though, i have many things to be thankful for: i'm thankful that i have a sweetheart of a boyfriend. i'm thankful for my many awesome friends. i'm thankful for my supportive family. i'm thankful for being able to drop in on my brother and his family whenever i'm in the area. i'm thankful for them feeding me too! i'm thankful that i was able to afford to get my car fixed today. i'm thankful for the roof over my head. i'm thankful for the clothes on my back and shoes on my feet. i'm thankful for the food in my refrigerator. i'm thankful for the job that i have (really, i am). i'm thankful that i've lost 7 lbs. on the sbd!  i'm going to continue my "i'm thankful list" through the week.

      my johnny gave me  the  cutest card for our anniversary.  it has a bunch of pictures of a couple doing things like, watching tv, having a drink, rollerblading, cooking, working out and he added little captions to each one that pertained to us.  it was  so damn sweet !  i loved it.  then he wrote a very thoughtful note that included the fact that he would make and honest woman out of me and to have faith in him.  i told him that i do and that i'm not pressuring him.  i guess he says everyone else is!  everyone he sees asks him, when are you getting married, when are you getting married.  it will all happen when the time is right.   we are planning on going into town on saturday and spending the day walking around faneuil hall and then having dinner.  the weather is supposed to be great too!

      no, not silent, but deadly!!  it stands for the south beach diet.  i started it today.  i'm doing it with a girl from work who started it yesterday.  it seems pretty easy on paper, though it doesn't seem like there is a huge variety of what you can eat.  for breakfast, i had a cup of low-fat cottage cheese, a hard-boiled egg and some broccoli and cauliflower.  for lunch i had some beef stir fry with asparagus, broccoli and cauliflower, 1/2 of a cucumber and a red pepper.  i had 14 slices of pepperoni for my snack.  my water intake is hovering at 72 oz. right now.  oh, and i also had a coffe w/ sweet and low (yuck, i missed the real sugar).  i'm looking around for something to have for my next snack!  maybe peanuts.  i hate that headachy feeling.  i was wondering if i would encounter that...and i am.  i'm amazed that i have not had any carbs today.  no english muffins, no bagels, pasta, rice, cereal....

      yes, i'm tired.  didn't get home until 2am.  i slept in a bit and then drove into work, again!  are you seeing a pattern here?  yikes...i gotta slow down!  it's 11am now...john is probably still sleeping because he was smart and took half a day.  i'm drank my coffee and am now drinking a bottle of water.  i hope something kicks in soon.  ugh!  though the game wasn't that exciting, i'm glad the patriots won.  hey, a win is a win!  we tailgated for what seemed forever!  after the game, i was so psyched to tailgate some more and have a cheeseburger.  the guys fired up the grill up and started cooking.  i guess i wasn't that psyched up, because i fell asleep in my chair.  when i woke up and the guys were packing everything up.  i'm like, "did anyone make me a cheeseburger?"  they are like, you fell asleep, dude.  it's gone!  waaaa!

      last night, we went out w/ john's friend, bonnie, from work, and her husband, patrick.  we went to dinner at dave & buster's in providence.  the place is huge!  i had a 1/2 rack of ribs that were very tasty and fell right off the bone.  part of this restaurants theme is a large room with arcade and video games.  we watched patrick play this star wars trilogy game.  then i saw this "morph booth".  i got in and it takes my picture, then john gets in and it takes his picture.  then it morphs the two of them together and gave us a picture of what our child would look like.  it states on the picture "for amusement only"...and that is exactly what we were saying as we were laughing our asses off!!  patrick said after seeing his picture, he isn't having children!!

      last night was our monthly girls night out get together.  instead of going out to dinner though, one of the girls had a tarot card reading party.  the card reader was very good!  she hit on everything for me.  here is a synopsis:   life  - the first thing she said was that there has been a lot of talk about marriage.  (as you all know, yes, there has been).  she said that i will definitely marry the man that i'm involved with and that i will get engaged soon.  he is a good guy, she says.  (hey, i know that!)  she said that she sees it happening after the holidays, maybe around february (that would be a year that we have been in the house...valentine's day, maybe?)   children  - she asked if there were twins in the family (john's brother and sister are irish twins).  she said that i am very fertile and that she sees boys.  if i can do it and afford it, she sees three kids in my future (i better get started!)   home  - she said i like my house but am not crazy about the area.  she said it doesn't feel like the home where you grew up.  she said this will not be the last house that we are in.  the cards also told her that some work will be done done on the outside of the house, painting it, windowsills or something like that (we need to put gutters on it and we have talked about shutters).  she also saw something being done near the garage that will make it look nice (we are talking about putting a flower bed in surrounded by a nice wall).  she says all of this is going to increase the value of the house.    career  - she said that i don't like to work, i only do it because i have to (i guess this could be true of anyone).   money  - she says there will be some sort of bonus coming at the end of the year.  some sort of extra money (definitely won't be from work!).  maybe i will win the lottery!   health  - she studied this card pretty intently.  it told her that i am in good health except that something happened to my back, that it is bothering me (and we all know about that story!).   miscellaneous  - she started asking about my dad and then asked if he was deceased (he is).  she then asked if i had an older brother (i do).  she said that she sees him leaving a job and going back to an old job.  he will learn a lot there, but he knows what he is doing already.  she said it is a good move (my brother is going back to an old restaurant that he used to work at for 25 years!)    oh, and she said that i need to slow down when driving...that i have a lead foot (wow, that was right on)!  she also said that i got a new hip haircut (it's fairly new, shorter than i usually have it).  we talked off the record afterwards and she asked me my sign.  i'm a taurus, as is john.  she mentioned that it is very common for a taurus woman to be involved in a relationship for a long time and have it not work out and then meet "the one".  (hmmm, that explains a lot!)  we were able to record the session, which i did, but unfortunately, the stupid tape or the recorder messed up and it came out sounding like satan talking on the tape!  i wonder if that was a sign that i wasn't meant to play it for john?  very eerie!!  i told john about it anyway when i got home and he thinks it is all a bunch of malarky!

       urlLink Naked sushi bar!    "It's dehumanizing, the manner in which people are buying and selling sushi to be eaten off a woman's body. It's dehumanizing to be treated as a plate," said Cherry Cayabyab, president of the local chapter of National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum.   what an odd concept.  i might have a problem eating off of a human plate...especially a woman.  but wait...maybe a donut bar with naked men?  the donuts would be displayed on...well, you get the picture, don't you?

      i never realized how dependent i was on my palm pilot.  not until it shit the bed on me this past sunday.  i used it saturday night with no problem.  on sunday, it wouldn't turn on at all.  i wanted to call my aunt but couldn't because her phone number was in there...in my palm pilot, the little blue box, unable to be retrieved...lost in the dark hole of bits and bytes.  then the dreadful truth started to descend on me like a sinister cloud.  what will i do without my palm pilot?  how will i know what is scheduled in my life when i can't see my calendar?  how will i call or write anyone if their addresses and phone numbers are lost forever?  my train schedule is on there...my tip calculator, birthdays, who i sent and who i received xmas cards from for the last three years.  can all my data be recovered?  am i going to have to resort to *gulp* paper? please tell me it can be rescued....my life is in that little crystal blue case.  i had tried everything; a soft reset, a hard reset, changed the batteries and even banged it around a little.  nothing!!!  so, i sent palm an email and they responded with a laundry list of things to try.  the ticket was taking the batteries out for 30 minutes, performing a soft reset it and voila...i can breathe!!  thank god i had everything backed up on my computer.  i'm back in business and all is right in the world...well, at least in MY world :)

      well, today was pretty much a shit day all around.  i actually had an anxiety attack on the train on the way home!  what the hell is wrong with me?  i really shouldn't let work get to me like that...it really isn't healthy.  i'm sure all the thinking i've been doing, about life mostly, doesn't help.  it all started friday night, well really, it started way before that, but friday is a good place to start.  john and i went out with another couple for dinner.  the woman of the other couple said, "i am expecting an engagement ring soon".  at that moment, daggers came darting out of my eyes at john.  i'm thinking, if they get married before we do, i'm going to be pissed...since we were dating first.  i know that sounds petty and it really doesn't make a difference.  ~are you buying that?~  ok, maybe it makes a little bit of a difference.  mostly, because that couple really, probably, most likely, shouldn't be getting married.    so, the ride home consisted of discussing why aren't we getting married soon?  and i'm not getting any younger, what about having kids?  we know we want to be together and we own a house together.  the main reason comes down to money.  having just bought a house and a myriad of things to maintain it; sprinkler system, lawn tractor, hedge clippers, leaf blower, and other things that you just need; pool cover, wood for the stove, furniture, etc...you get the gist.  i know weddings cost money...but if we wait until we have money, we will never get married!  same with having kids.  who knows if either of us can even have kids!  you never know what life is going to throw you.  and personally, i'm done with being thrown things, ok?  are you listening up there?  i'm hoping that john and i will figure it all out.  i'm sure we will...it will just take some time.  john, i love you dearly and want to move forward and celebrate our life together.

      completely overwhelmed today.  i have a group of contractors that i have somehow been made responsible for that keep (meaning, the project manager is in another state!) asking for all sorts of things.  power strips, access cards, backup applications, new chairs, email accounts!  ugh!  did i sign up for this?  i don't think so.  i'm trying to restore some files for a guy at work and it isn't working...probably because the weekend backups haven't been working for a while.  there is so much information being backed up on the nt side, that it takes four tapes and is backing up during production on mondays!  therefore, we might not even have a backup of what he needs....argh!  on top of all that, i'm trying to handle any other calls that come in.

      an unexpected meeting for one of our lunchers cancels the outing.  so, i'm eating what i brought for lunch; 1/2 a turkey rollup, grapes, and a yogurt.  i already had my mid-morning snack of a banana and will save my kashi go lean bar for my late-afternoon snack.  it's all good!

      well, 4 days of good eating!  yay for me.  looking back on my food journal, i'm living on salads, chicken, fruit, vegetables and eggs.  i need to diversify just a little.  i'm drinking my water too...so frequent visits to the little girl's room are necessary.  i swear, i must go 10  times during the day!  i'm going out to lunch today and usually that is a huge challenge for me.  i always go with good intentions of ordering something healthy and then end up going off the board for a $1000, alex, and order a big-ass plate of fried everything.  today, i am getting a big salad.  i will not be swayed by the orders of others at the table, as i usually can be.  i will focus on eating slowly too.  that is another one of my big challenges.  i eat as if my plate has little feet and will run away at its first chance!  or someone is going to run by and grab my meal right off the table!

      If you won a million dollars...   1. What are the first 3 things you'd buy?  a new car, a motorcycle and a vacation house   2. What are 3 things you'd do?  get married and start having kids, quit my job and open a scrapbook store, travel.   3. What are 3 charities or people you'd give some of the money to?  i would give money to the cancer society, multiple sclerosis society, and make sure that my closest family and friends were taken care of.  nowadays a million dollars really isn't that much!  i probably wouldn't be able to do all of the above on a million....maybe a couple of million :)  it's nice to dream once in a while.

      why is it so difficult to lose weight?  why?  i had all intentions of starting all over, yet again, today.  a brand new day, i can do this.  as soon as i walked into work, the candy dish attacked me and the free bagels in the kitchen accosted me!  i don't know if i should file a harrassment suit or not.    it just isn't fair.    i have plans to go to the gym tonight, too.  i already know it's the last thing i'm going to feel like doing when i get off the train.  there really isn't an excuse...i drive right by the gym on the way home!  i've gained almost all the weight back that i lost when i was on weight watchers last.  i can feel it weighing me down.  i hate it, it's uncomfortable and i don't want it!  tomorrow is a new day, i guess.  wow, that sounded convincing, huh?  i bet i convinced the pants right off of you, right?  maybe my mood will improve later...

      ok, it's been a while since i posted and a lot has happened. hopefully, i can remember all of the details.  some things are a little fuzzy.   christmas eve day  -  i baked most of the day.  i made  urlLink nana's upside down cake  from tastefully simple for john's family party which was being held that night.  when i went to flip it out of the pan, it broke into pieces and looked like crap!  i was screaming bloody murder over it.  john came running up from the basement thinking i stabbed myself or something.  i just suck at cooking and baking, so i think.  anyway, i was able to piece it together and make it look halfway decent.  i figured i would top it with cool whip mixed with the tastefully simple's  urlLink instant mulling spice .  i also made a  urlLink dried tomato & garlic beer bread  for our neighbor.  not until later that night did i realize that i made that incorrectly too!!  i hope it still tasted good.  i will probably never know though.  the last thing i made was a santa head cake for christmas day.  it came out awesome!  you bake a 9 x 11 cake and then the recipe instructs you how to cut it so you get a beard, face and hat out of it.  then you use food coloring to tint the frosting for the face and hat and use coconut for the beard.  it really came out tremendous if i do say so myself :)   christmas eve  - john's family party was held at his aunt and uncle's house in allston.  it was very enjoyable.  it was nice to get everyone together.  there was lots of food and wine.  john's cousins had me in the grab.  she gave me a sunflower yankee candle and a kit to grow mini sunflowers in my yard.  i love sunflowers.  soon my dining room will be redone in sunflowers.  i can't wait to get rid of the dancing bear motif that is there right now.  i had one of john's cousins in the grab, who we bump into at patriot games, so i got him one of the afc east champion hats.  oh and remember the upside down cake that i was so pissed about?  it was the hit of the party!   christmas day  - john and i got up and opened our presents.  santa was very good to me!  i got some books, a cd, scrapbooking materials, a few sunflower decorations, and the second season of csi on dvd.  i got john a watch, some cologne and a suede jacket.    then it was off to visit family.  we went to my brother's house for breakfast and present swapping.  they gave me an awesome suede blazer.  when we got to john's parents we found out that that his brother was in a car accident and was taken to boston medical.  john's poor mother is trying to whip up a lasagna before heading in to the hospital by herself.  i told her to stop what she was doing and we will all go in to the hospital to visit rob.  she was so glad to hear that.  rob received 34 stitches in his head but was ok otherwise.  his 2-year-old daughter was in the car too and thankfully escaped with a few scrapes.  when we got home, the neighbors brought over a huge bag of chinese food.  we ate that for christmas dinner and made the best of the rest of the day, opening presents and such.  thank god everyone is ok.   day after christmas  - it felt great to sleep in for once.  we didn't do much at all, hung around and watched some tv.  it was good to do nothing.  oh, and found out that  urlLink this engagement   happened on christmas eve.  they are looking at a 2005 wedding.   that night we went out with maura and some of her friends in town.  we ate at  urlLink ristorante saraceno ...one of the best italian restaurants in the north end.  we had another  urlLink celebrity sighting  . chet curtis was in the house!  he is or was a local news anchor. we had a fabulous meal and two bottles of wine and then moved on to a few bars for some beverages.  because of the holiday, boston was dead, no one was out.   saturday  - we went to the last patriot's game of the season.  barbara, her husband, jeff, and her sister met up with us in the parking lot to tailgate.  john b. was in charge of cooking...he made egg mcmuffins that were out of this world.  we also split a bottle of raspberry stoli!  you would think i would learn, right?  we had tons of munchies and food...i definitely ate too much crap that i would pay for later.  the game was unbelievable!  it was such a good game to watch. and what could be better than beating the bills "31-0"!!  i swear that was planned.  playoffs, here we come!  i saw berna, max, tammy and kevin inside.  it was berna's 29th birthday   HAPPY BIRTHDAY BERNA!    she tailgated in the weei tent...free food and beer.  she had her face painted and  looked so cute - she had the patriots logo on both cheeks, the number 12 on her forehead and a candle on her nose!  i got home around 6:30 and went to bed and didn't wake up until 8am the next day.  i definitely caught up on some much needed sleep!   sunday  - did some cleaning around the house to get ready for a visit from john's mom and her sister, who is going to be in town this week.  i went over barbara and jeff's to see her house and the kids.  josie and patrick are cutie patooties!   monday  - back to work!  ugh!  it was so nice to have 5 days off in a row.  now i'm busy planning what to do for new year's eve!  does it ever end? oh yeah, and i'm back on sbd...kind of fell off the wagon over the holidays...but i got the book for christmas and i'm back on phase 1!

      just who do pedestrians think they are?  every day, there are people that just walk across the street regardless of the light color or what else is going on in the street, mainly cars driving back and forth, causing said cars to come to a screeching halt!!  i patiently (which isn't one of myh strengths) wait for the light to turn red or make sure there aren't any cars coming and then cross the street. aargh!

      i just received my secret santa gift via amazon!  when i was first told that there was an amazon package at the front desk, i thought, oh shit, amazon messed up and shipped the gift i ordered to me.  now i have to ship it myself.  but, nope, i was wrong, it was my gift from my secret santa...who was by the way, WAY too generous!!!!!  he sent the very best of john lennon cd AND the guardian by nicholas sparks.  if you are out there and reading this,  thank you, thank you, thank you !!  also, please comment with your website name so i can come say "hi".  i guess the official revealing of secret santas doesn't happen until after christmas and there was no note with the package.  hope you have a great secret santa too!

      so, i'm on the train this morning.  i was on the top floor of the double decker car.  halfway down the car is a sign for the emergency exit and it points to the window.  now, i'm thinking, if there is an emergency, i have to jump out the window?  it's a big jump from the 2nd floor to the ground!  i wonder if there is a rope ladder hidden somewhere?  it also disturbs me that the emergency equipment, an ax,  is usually missing from its home.  i'm sure they took that away after sept. 11.

      last night was john's work xmas party.  it was a lot of fun.  the bartender looked like a full-sized mini-me from austin powers.  this of course was whispered in my ear by john's friend's husband as i was paying the bald-headed man.  he probably wondered why i guffawed in his face.  poor guy!

      just as the snow from last weekend's storm has melted, another one is on the way.  oh joy!  is this winter going to be one of those storm-every-weekend-type winters?  god, i hope not.  i love snow and all, but it is such a hassle to get around in.  if i were still in school and got snow days...it could snow every day for all i care.  well, we wait in suspense to see if the meteorologists are right or wrong.

      i'm feelin' a little out of the loop with my friends.  it is weird.  some have had kids recently, others have moved away, and others just have things going on.  i know everyone gets wrapped up in their own lives, and i'm no different.  but i want to see my friends more often.  it is just so hard sometimes...they have to get a babysitter lined up or there is an hour drive involved.  i remember the days of just being able to call up someone on a whim, last minute, and decide to go out somewhere.  those were the days when everyone you cared about lived within a 5 mile radius of each other.  now, everyone is spread out all over the place.  i have a few groups of friends.  there are my closest friends that go way back with me, there are my hockey wife friends (john's friends wives), the after-divorce friends, and then there are peripheral friends (people i love, but see rarely).  sometimes we all intermingle, other times we do things separately.  instead of exchanging gifts for xmas this year, we decided to go out to dinner instead.  so, i have four dinners to attend.  i think it is  way  better than a gift!  this way you get to spend time with the people you love, chat, laugh and have a great time.  i hope everyone else feels the same way.

      we got our tree! yippee!  we went to our favorite local nursery and picked it out.  before we left, we rearranged the furniture (several time) to find the best place to display the tree.  i always want to go overboard and buy a bigger tree than necessary, or i pick out a tree that i think is going to fit in my space and i'm way off.  so john had me stand with my arm raised above my head.  he measured the distance from my feet to the tips of my fingers to give me an idea of how big of a tree we were planning on getting.  the height came out to about 7', give or take a few inches.  we searched and searched the lot.  one was too short, one was too fat, one was too sparse.  we found one we liked, but thought it was too tall.  we searched some more and and kept going back to the "too tall tree".  it was perfectly shaped and very full.  we decided to buy it.  it was a 10' tree!   so much for the pre-measuring we did!  we got it home and placed it in the christmas tree stand that i had (which is like 10 years old).  it didn't seem to want to hold the tree very sturdily.  hmm, the box says "to be used for trees up to 7' tall".  john went slogging out  in the snow again to buy a bigger tree stand.  he also picked up several strands of white lights.  i like colored lights myself, but john says that colored lights are outdated and that white ones give the tree a classier christmas look.  whatever!  i think the white lights will look good though because we have them in the windows and on the outside of the house.    the tree looks fabulous and we don't even have it decorated yet.  we are so excited to decorate our first tree together and celebrate our first christmas in our new house.  it is going to be the best christmas tree ever.  eat your heart out charlie brown!

      the afc east!  they are on fire!  in the midst of a snowstorm too!  i went to the game last night and wow, i guess it was a good game!  i don't remember much of it.  i unfortunately drank raspberry stolies in the parking lot and they all hit me at once and turned me into some sort of deranged lunatic that john couldn't handle.  oops!  i guess i was being obnoxious and annoying everyone around us.  luckily, it is the same group of people each week, so i'm sure they will forgive me, i hope.  and how cool did the snow fireworks look?  i had fun creating them, too much fun!  i guess also at one point, i dashed out to the concession area and ran into berna and max.  they had a good seat on top of a snowbank behind our section.  their normal seats are in the 300's, aka the nosebleed section.  it takes forever to get there and with all the snow and wind gusts, i would have taken the snowbank over those seats too.  of course, i don't think they have sat in their own seats all season!  i was bawling my eyes out because john was mad at me.  then i started dancing with max, fell down, took the trash barrel with me and started doing snow angels in the snowbank.  so, apparently, i quickly forgot that john was mad at me.  this is all hearsay of course because i'm hearing it from berna and i don't remember doing any of that :)  meanwhile, poor john didn't know if i had walked back to the car or was lost somewhere in the stadium!  i returned with a hot dog, french fries (berna demanded that i eat something) and a big smile.  all was better with the world!    i feel like ass today though.  i almost lost my cookies a few times on the train this morning.  and i really didn't think i drank that much.  i think it had more to do with the fact that i only had a salad.  i was trying to be sbd good.  i even brought some hard boiled eggs and apricots for a snack!  the hot dog and fries threw me off the wagon though.  it's ok though, i'm down 11 lbs. in 18 days!  woo hoo!

      this article just cracked me up!  i can't believe there is actual research going on like this!   Women who perform the act of fellatio on a regular basis, one to two times a week, may reduce their risk of breast cancer by up to 40 percent, a North Carolina State University study found.     Doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer,  (why would they?)  but new research being performed at North Carolina State University is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two  (new research being "performed"?) .  In a study of over 15,000 women suspected  (just a sneaky suspicion, huh?)  of having performed regular fellatio over the past ten years, the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly, one to two times a week, had a lower occurance of breast cancer than those who had not. There was no increased risk, however, for those who did not regularly perform  (thank god!) .  "I think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act," said Dr. B.J. Sooner of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research  (he really wanted to be though) . "I am surprised by these findings, but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurance of breast cancer in women."  (this is obviously a statement made by a man....now all women are to run out and perform fellatio on their boyfriends so they won't develop breast cancer!)   The University researchers stressed that, though breast cancer is relatively uncommon, any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision.   (another male comment)   "Only with regular performance will your chances be reduced, so I encourage all women  (i bet you do)  out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine," said Dr. Inserta Shafteer, one of the researchers at the University. "Since the emergence of the research, I try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances."   (are you kidding me?)   The study is reported in Friday's Journal of Medical Research.   In 1991, 43,582 women died of breast cancer, as reported by the National Cancer Institute.  (i bet none of them performed fellatio on a regular basis too)   Dr. Len Lictepeen, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said women should not overlook or "play down" these findings.  (how can he say this with a serious face?)   "This will hopefully change women's practice and patterns, resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases," Lictepeen said.  (all men around the world are hope so!)   Sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are, for whatever reason, not able to fellate regularly.   "There's definitely fertile ground for more research. Many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages," he said.   (i bet a lot of men want to be the receiver of this "research")   Almost every woman is, at some point, going to perform the act of fellatio,  (oh really!)  but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference, say researchers.   The reasearch consisted of two groups, 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio on a regular basis over the past five to ten years, and 9,728 women who had not. The group of women who had performed fellatio had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent.   "The findings do suggest that there are other causes for breast cancer besides the absence of regular fellatio," Shafteer said. "It's a cause, not THE cause."  (i'm glad they reiterated that statement...imagind if not performing fellatio was THE cause of breast cancer!!!)    full story  urlLink here  without my witty comments.  i'm all up for reducing my chance of breast cancer and i'm sure now john will be too!!!

      (can you name the singer of that line?)  yeah, i know, it's been quiet around here.  i just haven't had time to gather any thoughts and write them down.  i figured i would try to put someting cohesive together for you to read then just some old blather.  i'm sure you don't want to read a bunch of drivel, hmmm, on second thought, if you are still here, i guess you do :)  sbd is still going great, down 10 lbs. in 11 days.  tomorrow is the end of phase 1 for me, though i might continue on it until the end of the week and then head into phase 2.  it's been really simple...eat lots of protein and veggies.  i think the lots of veggies is leading to the lots of gas....poor john!  i'm addicted to these little ricotta mousse things.  i could eat them all day!  you mix ricotta w/ vanilla extract or ricotta w/ peanut butter.  it might sound gross...but it is on the idea of tiramisu, which is made with mascarpone cheese.  work has been kind of a nightmare.  apparently, people don't have enough to do because they have started complaining about the looks of the office and how depressing it is to come in every day and see a dirty kitchen, computers strewn all over the place, telecom equipment stacked up in the hallways, just plain messiness everywhere.  so, an all out war has been started and every employee has two weeks to clean up their areas.  an "audit" is going to be conducted to see if everything is up to par (whatever par is?).  we have been in this office for over 12 years and nothing has ever been updated or fixed.  the carpets are old, the walls are old, the cubes are old.  i think a lack of caring usurps the place.  on the homefront things are great.  john hung white icicle lights all around the edge of the house and the garage.  he was even up on the roof in the wind on saturday, god love him.  there is a gigantic wreath donning the side of the house and another over the garage.  we have pine needle garland with a set of white lights intertwined throughout it, wrapped around the railing of the porch, a little painted wooden christmas tree hangs from my welcome sign.  inside, i have my little village all set up on top of the entertainment center, complete with fake snow.  i went a little crazy with the fake snow...it has snowed all over the mantel too.  i set up a bunch of christmas doo-hickey things there too.  i replaced my sunflower motif in the dining room with a snowman one.  it is definitely beginning to look a lot like christmas!  especially with this cold weather we are having!!  what the hell was up with everyone's commute today?  patti sat on an on-ramp for an hour and half.  it took dan and beth 3 hrs. to go 7 miles to get to work and my train put-putted along and ended up being a half hour late!  we live in new england, folks, learn how to drive in the snow!  so what if it was a snow squall...what are you going to do when it really starts snowing?  so, how is everyone else doing?  it's oh so quiet is sung by bjork!

      remember this  urlLink post  where i talked about our neighbor's barking dogs?  well, john told me some disturbing news last night.  he felt quite guilty about it too.  george was hit by a car the other day :(  george was the barker...and he always escaped out of the yard.  he would dig a hole under the chain link fence, he was that determined to get out!  john felt awful because he used to always say he wished that the dog would die so the barking would stop.  of course he said it kiddingly, who knew that the dog would actually bite the bullet!  now he feels awful!    he found this out yesterday while snowblowing.  he went over to talk to the neighbor and only the one dog was there.  the neighbor told him what happened to the other one and then abruptly said she couldn't talk about it anymore.  she was clearly distraught about it.  those dogs are her babies.    well, she still has one shitzu, and we now have some peace and quiet.

      i made an easy $75 cash for two hours of work last night.  i participated in a focus group about the south beach diet.  it was actually very interesting.  they want to get your feedback about the diet, the pros and cons, what you like and dislike about the diet, etc.  then they showed us a "concept".  they are thinking about developing a south beach bar and shake.  they provided us with a little marketing blurb along with some nutritional information.  they wanted to know if we would be likely or not to purchase these products.  it was a lot of fun...though the guy next to me had brutal breath...and another guy had an annoying voice.

      people are actually up my ass asking me to update my site so they can hear all about the weekend!  wow, i have fans...pretty neat!  anyway, my long weekend began on thursday of last week.  i picked my niece, vicki, up at the airport and we went straight to her aunt's house, ellen and andrea.  they are on her mom's side.  i'm vicki's aunt on her dad's side, he is my brother...just so you can get the relations straight.  her aunt ellen had a huge spread of homemade chicken soup, chicken salad and tuna fish sandwiches, a platter of pickles, olives and cold cuts and a 4-layer black forest cake for dessert.  it was such a nice get together with her aunts and cousins.    thursday night i had planned for us to go to my brother's restaurant with john and my sister-in-law.  unfortunately, my sister-in-law and john didn't feel very well, so i decided we would just stay local and go to the restaurant another day.  i saw kerry online and told her i wanted her to meet my niece.  i asked her if she was going to be home so we could stop by after dinner.  we ended up going to kerry's first, drank a few cocktails and then the three of us ended up at the eaglebrook saloon.  it was an impromptu evening and it ended up being quite a blast.   friday, we went to my brother's restaurant for lunch and he was able to take a break and eat with us.  it was nice for her to be able to catch up with him.    friday night we went to the ice cats hockey game in worcester.  john's work had the event planned before i even knew vicki was coming, so he was able to get her a ticket.  vicki had never been to a hockey game in her life!  we didn't watch a hell of a lot of the game...but we had many beers.  she was asking if a puck could hit us.  i told her it is known to happen.  don't you know, that a few minutes later, vicki gets whacked in the knee by a puck!  she was ok, but she thought it was hysterical...she had to text message her friends to tell them it was such an experience!  oh yeah, she is obsessed with her phone...it didn't stop ringing and jingling with text messages from all her friends that apparently can't move without her.  (she actually got a message from one of them that said, i kid you not, "i'm going to take a shower and then go out"!)  i had to take the damn phone away from her.  after the game we went to brew city for some drinks.  they had over 75 beers!  it was so hard to choose one.  we were all pretty tipsy.  at one point vicki wanted her phone, so i gave it to her...without the battery!  she kept trying to turn it on...and finally decided it was dead.  that was a great prank...i didn't tell her until we got home what i had done.  needless to say, she didn't think it all that funny :)  we ended up staying over john's friends house and went home the next day around 11am.  vicki napped for a few hours on saturday...she was wiped and wanted to rest up for the big "limo" night!  we all (me, vicki, patti and liz) started at my house around 6 and had pizza that i ordered for dinner.  we made apple martinis and mudslides, we also had beer and captain and cokes.  yikes, sounds like a liquor store!  the limo came to pick us up at 7:30.  barry was the driver of the big black limousine that picked us up.  we decided we were going to go to  urlLink coyote ugly  and see where the night led us.  well, we ended up spending the whole night there.  that place was a complete blast!  the bartenders dance on this stage and they let the ladies in the house dance too.  they also spank guys up on stage if it's their birthday.  they bend the guy over and stand over them with a belt and give them a good whipping.  the bartenders look like they really enjoy their jobs! they work their butts off too.  we were getting a lot of attention, which was nice.  i was licking bald guys heads (not that kind of head, get your minds out of the gutter!)  this behavior seems to stem from the time i went to key west and melissa and i were doing it...don't really know why...we just were.  i think i licked like 6-7 guys heads.  they had told me i was the first to ever do that to them.  i'm sure that gave them something to talk about!  vicki loved dancing on stage...that is so her world!  she lives to dance!  we left the club around 12:30 to be home within the 6 hr. time limit we had on the limo.  liz barfed in her cooler on the way home.  i was passed out in the back of the limo.  we got home and ate a tornado of potato chips and cooked up a whirlwind of steak-um and cheese sandwiches and washed it all down with whatever other food we could find...cookies, pistachio nuts, etc.  you would have thought we had never eaten!  we all crashed in the living room.  it was a great night.  liz, again, didn't feel too well in the morning. can you say what's upchuck?  sunday was pretty much a day of recovery and driving vicki to the airport to go home.  i didn't want her to leave.  i wish she lived closer so we could hang out all the time.  we said that would probably be a bad thing because we would be out all the time!!  she had a great time and next time, john and i will have to go to maryland.  so that was my weekend in a nutshell.  i hope you enjoyed it!

      i may not be posting for a few days, if any of you care.  my niece is coming up from maryland to visit for 4 whole days!  i'm so excited.  i haven't seen her in just over a year.  she is only 3 years younger than me.  how is that possible, you ask?  my brother is 17 years older than me...that explains it, right?  her lovely daughter is my godchild...unfortunately, she will not be accompanying her mom on this trip.    anyway, i have many things planned...dinner, a hockey game, and to top the whole visit off...a night out in boston with my friends in a limo!  watch out boston because some very raring-to-go-out-thirsty-thirty-something women will be painting the town red, or at least coloring it a pretty pink!  we are ready to "rip it up" as liz put it in an e-mail.  i will be sure to sum up the outings as soon as i can!

      P-A-T-S, PATS, PATS, PATS!  the patriots did it, as i knew they would :)  they beat the colts into submission.  what a phenomenal game!  i have no voice left  (i'm sounding a bit demi mooreish) whatsoever from screaming so much.  i don't think i've ever yelled so much in my life, contributing to the loudest noise i have ever heard in that stadium!    so, off to the superbowl, my beau, john, will go, leaving me behind to search for a fun superbowl party to attend, or maybe i will have my own.  hmmm!    houston, we haven't a problem! pats will beat the cats!

      i hate when people don't stay to the right when on stairs, escalators, sidewalks, and going through doors. i hate when someone is standing right in front of me on a packed train with their crotch, like, right there, in my damn face. i hate when people don't clean up their messes in the lunch room at work. i hate when people cross the street against the light and cause cars to come to a screeching halt.

      it's beyond cold today, yes.  but does that render a license to everyone to be an asshole?  the redline was a complete mess today, disabled trains everywhere, packed platforms, people getting pissed off by the seconds.  i heard one lady ranting on the phone about how she she is stuck at south station, was going to be late,  she's been waiting for over 1/2 an hour, and how dare the mbta raise fares and supply such shoddy service, blah, blah, blah.  then when we finally get on the train, i mean sardine can, there is always someone telling people to move into the middle where there is plenty of room.  this one guy is like, "dude, move in, there is plenty of room in there, we've all been waiting forever, come on!"  yes, there is room, but no where to hold on, therefore, leaving little old ladies in the middle trying to subway surf.  i was getting pissed myself, but there is nothing you can do about it.  i look at it as "shit happens".  it's 40 below zero, give them a break!  even though this was the 2nd time this week i experienced bad red line service, i try not to let it get to me.  everyone is going to complain, i guess, and there is nothing i can do about that either.

      i'm a little worried about my stepsister, wendy.  i think she has gone over the edge and i really don't know how to approach the subject with her.  here is the story.    she and i went to lunch the week before christmas.  she had called me to switch the venue and she sounded a little strange.  when i met up with her, i asked her if everything was ok, that i thought she sounded a bit off on the phone.  she said, well, my husband did something that i wished he hadn't.  he had given her her christmas present early. it was a diamond ring, one of those past-present-future ones.  she explained that he had put it on a little santa that popped out of a jack-in-the-box.  (awww, so sweet!)  the diamond in the middle was 2 carats and the other two were 1 carat each.  it was a stunningly beautiful ring, if you ask me.  i'm like, you wish he hadn't done this?  she went on to explain that jewelry is a very personal thing and that this ring just wasn't "her".  it wouldn't be something that she would have picked out.  i said to her, i hope you didn't say that to him.  she said, no, but that she didn't give him the reaction that she thought he expected.  god, i would not have been able to gush enough about it if it were me receiving that ring.  later that week, she calls me to tell me that the ring could be returned within 2 weeks of purchase.  she returned the ring and had already gone out and found something else she liked...but...she put it on hold because she wanted to go to the jeweler's building just to make sure she doesn't see something else that she likes.  she also told me how much the original ring had cost...$16,500.  i almost choked...she is wearing a friggin' car on her finger for christ sakes.  how the hell can they afford that i have no idea....a house, a car, 2 kids and she is a stay-at-home, shopoholic mom!    she wanted me to go looking with her, but i wasn't available.  she told me that she loves my friend barbara's ring and wanted to call her to ask her about it.  i was tentative about this, but i figured she would have a little chat and be done with it.  well, boy, was i wrong.  she not only discussed the ring with barbara for over 35 minutes, she showed up at barbara's house uninvited.  she executed a conniving pop-in if you ask me.  she told barbara she just "happened" to be in her neighborhood.  oh please...she wanted to have another look at that ring and she was going to do whatever it took to see it!  i'm embarrassed that she would be acting like this.  barbara said it almost sounds like she is going to have the same ring made...and this is after wendy said that she wanted something "different" from everyone else!    she has become obsessed with getting a ring.  the last time i talked to wendy was the day before she popped in on barbara and i haven't talked to her since.  she mentioned that she wanted to go ring shopping again this weekend or out to lunch or something.  i don't know what i'm going to say to her.  i think the whole thing is bizarre!

      the patriots are just on fire!  last night's game was awesome!  brady doing blocks, throwing touchdowns...on fire, i say!    the fans in the stands on the other hand, were not on fire, but freezing our patooties off!  i didn't think it was that cold.  we were dressed appropriately, so it was fairly comfortable to me.  my beer on the other hand kept freezing on me...maybe i wasn't drinking it fast enough?  um, no, that probably wasn't it, we are talking about ME here!  john snuck in a flask of peppermint schnapps that we took hits off of every now and then to keep the insides warm.  there was this obnoxious drunk guy sitting next to me that kept pinching my ass and trying to kiss me.  i could handle him for the most part, but then i told john to switch seats with me.  the guy didn't pinch john's ass.  with all the damn layers of clothes on, and the large amount of alcohol streaming through his system...i'm surprised the guy could tell the difference between us!  the guy that sits in front of me that i bothered a few weeks ago was there, but was sitting two seats down.  i apologized for my behavior and asked why he was sitting where he was?  his friends said it was because of me.  he now had another nemesis....the "ass-pinching-guy".  he was bothering him throughout the game and told me he would sit in front of me now anyday!

      thoughts from my morning commute:  thank god it is friggin' friday.  it has been the longest week ever!  i have kahlua cream coffee this morning from honey dew.  something totally different for me.  this guy on the train has a lamp in his bag.  is he bringing it to work to put on his desk?  it's a big lamp.  finished my book on the train.  wish i had a metro paper so i could do the crossword puzzle, but i was late this morning and unable to get one before i got on the train.  i can get one at south station.  there is always a guy there handing out the metro.  the paper is free...i hope they pay these people to pass out a free paper.  how does that paper make any money?  at back bay, the woman across from me asks me what stop this is.  duh, they just announced it and if you looked out your window you would see a large sign with the letters b-a-c-k-b-a-y-s-t-a-t-i-o-n in capital letters staring back at you.  maybe she can't read.  the girl in front of me has total static cling going on with her pants.  this other girl is wearing one of those bunny-fur type halo hat thingys.  how ugly!  and to top it off, it has little strings hanging off of it in the back that end with little bunny foot looking pom-poms...they look more like tampons!  where is my metro paper guy. the one day i don't get it before i get on the train, he's not here.  oh, there he is, phew!  oh boy, another trip on the red line.  the seats are two small on this train.  i'm forced to sit forward, because they are so close.  something smells.  the two kids across from me are eating pizza flavored pringles.  ewww!  that guy is trying to read the magazine that the girl next to him is reading.  get your own magazine, dude!  god, it is friggin' cold out.  if i'm this cold now, what the hell am i going to be on saturday?  a popsicle!  my snot is frozen it is so cold out.  i have a lame lunch today.  maybe the girls will want to go out for lunch.  not that i have money for lunch.  i guess i will have to take some out.  i wonder if anyone else talks to himself or herself like this on a daily basis?  it is pretty amusing to me seeing it in writing.

      first, people were suing mcdonald's for making them fat.  now, a  urlLink cable company is being sued  by a man who believes that cable turned his children into "lazy channel surfers" and made his wife fat.  he believes that the reason why he drinks and smokes everyday is because he has been watching tv everyday for the last four years.  who will be sued next?  i think i'm going to sue the maker of my couch.  it's their fault that i sit on it all the time and am lazy!  how ridiculous!

      i'm so excited...my niece (who is only 3 years younger than me, more of a sister than a niece) is coming up from maryland to visit for 4 days!  i haven't seen her since i went to her place last november for her daughter's (my godchild) 3rd birthday.  i want to make sure she has a good time because she is having some shitty life things going on right now.  so, i booked a limo for one night to go into boston w/ a bunch of friends.  i love to plan things but sometimes the logistics of things weighs on me.  i'm always trying to make sure everyone is happy and that they can come without breaking their bank.  sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  this is one that is probably going to be more expensive than usual, but hopefully, it will be worth it. i was waiting and waiting to book the limo to make sure i had enough people to make the limo cost effective, but finally, i just said "fuck it", i'm booking it because most of the people are psyched for a night out.  i don't want to worry about driving in and out of boston either, so the limo is the way to go!  the plan is to meet at my house, have something to eat with a few cocktails, then a few more cocktails in the limo on the way in to boston, then bar hop around town.  i haven't planned out the night's itinerary yet, but will do that soon!

      i talked to my friend dawn yesterday.  she was cleaning out a closet and found a box of old notes that i had written to her back in high school!  we were in hysterics as she read some of them to me.  every other one mentioned a different guy that we liked that week (complete with hand-drawn hearts), or me constantly asking if she wanted to go shopping or layout in the sun after school.  i had to ask her after some of the things she read me, "are you sure i wrote that?"  one part that had us bent over with fits of laughter was this: "i'm looking at "gorgeous" right now. "fatso" and "scumneck" are in my class too".  we have no idea who these people are!  i talked about getting my license and buying my car.  we talked in code a lot too, so we really had to think to remember what the hell we were talking about!  one of the more poignant letters talked about how we couldn't wait for christmas vacation.  little did we know how that year would turn out then.  it was the year that one of our friends was killed by a drunk driver while on her way to dawn's to celebrate christmas eve with us.  she is planning on keeping some of them so, i'm hoping to get some copies...if i do, i will definitely post the more amusing ones.  dawn was saying how she would like to go back to high school for just a week, with the knowledge she has now.  wouldn't we all?  she said she got a little sad reading the notes.  i think about how times have changed and how we have all grown up.  "what are we doing this weekend?" is no longer our biggest concern.  now we need to worry about house and car payments, getting to work on time, food shopping, and taking care of ourselves!  when did all that happen?

      on the flipside of all that, i think of the people that were left behind.  i still keep in touch with his family and some of his friends, but it isn’t the same.  it’s all awkward and weird. i hate that.  some of the friends just decided to write me off…i guess they couldn’t handle the awkwardness.  oh well…i hope i gained more than i lost in the grand scheme of things.

      i can't believe it is 2004.  where does the time go?  i'm feeling better, but not 100%.  i think this was the first new year's eve ever that i spent at home!  i'm not making any resolutions either.  they are a waste of time to me.  they would be the same every year anyway:  lose weight and be better with money.   so here is some news.  my ex-husband got married this past june after being divorced from me for about 4 years.  i don't think i even wrote about it.  i ended up hearing all about it from one of our mutual friends that was in town from seattle that had been at the wedding.  it was held at the ex's parents house in maryland.  it was one of those really awful rainy days.  aww, too bad!  the main points about this are that the ex has really changed and that no one likes his new wife!  now, i just found out that she is supposedly pregnant.  the idiot is telling people and she is only 5 weeks along!  you are supposed to wait at least 12 weeks before really telling anyone because anything can happen in the first trimester.  apparently, the ex-in-laws say she is using the pregnancy as a license to be extra bitchy and they are concerned because they consider her the child of the household already.  oh well, good luck to them.  all i can say is that from the descriptions i've heard of her, she is the complete opposite of me.  if the ex wanted to be with someone like that, why in the hell did he ever ask me to marry him??   i know one thing for sure, i'm so much better off now. i think of some of the friends that i have now that i would never have met if i didn't get divorced.  i know that sounds weird, but two that stick out in my mind are kerry and berna.  kerry ended up being my landlord when i moved into her two family house after the divorce.  her and her family have become very special to me.  i met berna through peggy after she invited me to martha's vineyard for july 4th weekend which was also the same weekend i moved into my house.  i was looking to have a good time and berna was there to have fun too.  we just hit it off.  i'm really lucky to have these two people in my life.

      i saw a guy on the t today with the biggest feet that i have ever seen.  they appeared even bigger because he had on these tannish-brown-almost-mustard-colored-bowling-shoe-styled shoes.  the guy was probably about 6' 4", so i guess he needs big feet to hold him up and balance him.  i kept looking over though.  wow, look at those feet.  whoa, those feet are huge.  yikes, those are the biggest feet ever.  hmmm....you know what they say about big feet?  *insert loud cackling laughter here*

      algiers is a little middle-eastern cafe in harvard square.  they are known for their coffee, but they serve breakfast all day and lunch and dinner.  we started off with an order of babaghanoush (sp).  cindy and i shared the marguesas (sp) - lamb sausages with hummus, adriana had the falafal sandwich and lisa had an omelet.  the food was all good, though very expensive.  we didn't order sodas because they were like $3.50 each!  after lunch i had the special algerian mint coffee, topped with whipped cream.  it was absolutely fabulous...i will probably be bouncing off the walls later on.    anyway, the bill came to just over $53.00 for 4 of us.  i went up to pay and get change because of course we all had twenty-dollar bills.  the woman tells me that she just started and only has this much change *shows me her bill holder with a pathetic amount of ones and a five*.  she says they have to bring their own change.  i said, well what are we supposed to do?  she said that they take credit cards.  i said, but we have cash?  i thought this was the most insane thing i have ever heard at restaurant.  we should have walked out.  if they can't make change, how the hell are we supposed to pay!!??  we ended up figuring it all out between the four of us and then going to the bank to get change for one of our twenties so that we could give each other the change due.

      i had a wonderful weekend.  i was able to scrap 15 pages!  i'm just about caught up now.  if you don't scrapbook, you don't understand ;)  my arms are killing me today though...no, it's not from scrapbooking.  i could only wish that scrapbooking could give me a good workout.  the pain is from pushing jeanne's car out of a ditch that patty got it stuck in saturday night.  backed it right down the driveway into some trees.  they ended up trekking around nh to find some sand and then we ended up having to request assistance from the new neighbor.    i am obviously so out of shape.  so, this has caused me to at least put my gym bag in the car and attempt to go to the gym after work.  we'll see if that happens.  i'm too tired to even write right now...so i'm ending this entry.

      this weekend, i'm off to new hampshire with some friends to scrapbook for the weekend.  i know some of you probably think this is weird, but it isn't.  i've got about 20 pages set up (i did some power layouting this week), so i hope i can get caught up with it all.  if i could find another place that hosts free graphics, i could post some examples...but until then, you will just have to check out the 'creative memories' link to the right to see what all the hub-bub is about.  anyway, i'm looking forward to hanging out w/ my girly-girlfriends and having tons of laughs.  it's been a while since we have all been together to just hang.

       urlLink did you hear that many of the ground rounds in the massachusetts area have closed down ?  it was never one of my favorite restaurants, but i do have to give them kudos for their nice big bars.  apparently, they closed without warning...just boom, the corporate offices contacted the managers that the restaurants were closing.  they didn't even let people finish their meals!  put your knife and fork down and get out!  couldn't they at least give them a doggy-bag?

      why must men on the T sit with their legs wide open and their arms draped across the seats next to them?  men have that wide stance while women are much more reserved, trying to take up as little as the seat they are sitting on as possible.  what is this non-verbal communication telling the world?  i think women need to start taking up more seats :)

      or should i say "happy hallmark holiday!"  we still celebrate it anyway.  john sent me a dozen roses to work yesterday.  very sweet!  i got him a little goody bag of little trinkets and candy.  i like being creative.  i gave him a card from our cat, chloe.  it read, "from the cat, i'm sending you this valentine because you give me lots of love and affection;" *open it up*  "and because i was unable to make anything heart-shaped in my litter box".  i then added, "but mommy helped me make a heart with my food" (written in her best "cat" paw writing)...and glued some food on the card in the shape of a heart!  i thought it was hysterical!  ok, i'm queer...get over it!

      sometimes i wish i could just say "fuck off" to some people.  unfortunately, i'm not that kind of person.  there are those people out there though that can.  they don't care and walk all over people.  they do their thing, not caring how it affects anyone else around them, and don't even seem to give it a second thought either.  if they are the "walkers", i'm the "walkee".  i seem to let myself get hiked all over just a little bit.  i don't like it, but i don't like confrontation either.  i choose the lesser of two evils.  i just accept it, and move on.  is that such a bad thing?

      Complete the sentences:  1. on sunday afternoon, i like to just... lay around and watch tv or catch up on errands that i need to do.  2. i'm behind someone at a traffic light, the light turns green and they just sit there, i... get impatient, throw my hands up in the air, and let a sigh of frustration out.  3. my immediate reaction to someone making a nasty remark to me is... whatever!  4. if i had to live in a state/country where it was cold most of the year, i would... deal with it.  i live in new england and it is pretty much cold half the year.  5. when the weather outside is hot and humid, i prefer to... be in the pool or inside with air conditioning.  6. my favorite 'comfy' clothes to wear around the house is... comfy pants and a t-shirt or sweatshirt.  7. if given a deadline at work/school to finish a project, i usually... try to get it done on time or as close to on time as possible.  8. if someone gave me a pet for my birthday, i would... love it to death.  i love animals!  of course, if it were a dog, john would make me give it back.  9. as far as watching the clock on weekends, i... don't.  until sunday night, when i'm complaining about going to work the next day.  10. i usually wash my car about every... 8 months.  yup, it's pretty dirty!

      this year she will have been divorced for as long as she was married.  she never thought she would ever get divorced...she seemed to have the perfect marriage, so she thought.  she tried very hard to keep it together in the end.  she tells me that she wonders, were there signs that she missed, how did things get to the point that they got to?  did he cheat on her or did he just almost cheat on her?  when people ask her what happened, she circumvents the question.  she just shrugs and says things simply didn't work out.  i mean, she probably feels like she is such a failure to cause her husband to look elsewhere for what he is missing...don't you think?  she wonders, what if i had done this, or what if i had done that?  would we still be together.  i tell her that hindsight is 20/20.  obviously, having 5 years to think about the "what ifs" helps you see the big picture.  she can't help but think, why did she have to endure this situation?  why does he still pop into her mind, why can she not bear to listen to her old wedding song, why does she care what is going on in his life?  she doesn't really care, but needs to make sure that she is doing way better than he ever will.  i tell her, hey, you are the one that is still on friendly terms with his family and you know that they don't like the "new wife", that has to feel good, doesn't it?  my friend has now been dating a guy for a long time and will probably marry him.  she discusses on end with me the questions and uncertainties of life.  i see them more as her  insecurities.  she inquires, almost in a challenging way, how do i know this won't end the same way?  i couldn't do it the first time, what makes me think i can do it this time?  i tell her what happened really had nothing to do with her, it was him.  she cautiously utters, how do you know that?  i declare to her that i just do.  my friend is a good person, she is caring, she is willing to do anything for anyone.  she is not selfish; she is loving and very giving.  her new boyfriend sees this and i can tell.  he will love her and treat her right and never do what her ex did to her.  she is in such a better position now than she ever was.  maybe writing this will make her really realize that.  boy, i sure do know a lot about my "friend", huh?

      i've been meaning to write about this, but i've been so damn busy.  work keeps getting in the way of my fun!  i received an invitation for this a few weeks ago from my friend, nicole, and thought it was such a cute idea.  she said it was the only time that she could get her husband and kids out of the house.  she had it last Saturday from 10:30-1:30 and there were about 14 of us there.  the menu consisted of a spiral ham, french toast casserole, scones, muffins, bagels and lox, crabmeat tart, spinach quiche, strawberries drizzled with vinaigrette sauce, fresh fruit, and baked brie and crackers...and the best dish, the pinnacle dish...grilled chocolate sandwiches.  grilled chocolate sandwiches?!  have you ever heard of such a thing?  they were out of this world!  i'm not even a lover of chocolate and i thought these were heaven on bread!  she also plied us with mimosas, bloody marys and kir royales.  all of this food and drink had awoken my taste buds.  they were not used to such rich food...especially since they have been eating "south beach" type dishes.   it was a great time to catch up with friends, get out of the house, away from the kids, the husbands, the boyfriends, cleaning, stress and any other wordly factors that affect us.  we should definitely do that more often!

      well, really my car was, not me.  i can't believe it!  i brought my car in to be inspected on feb. 2nd...only two days late...that is a record for me.  i never have a problem, even though my car is now 10 years old.  they come out and tell me that my car failed because the of the windshield wipers, some burnt out bulbs and a leak in the exhaust.  ugh!    so now i'm driving around with a big red "R" pasted to my windshield, can you say "loser"?  *places thumb and forefinger in the shape of an "L" up to forehead*  i have 60 days to rectify all of the problems.  *hmpphh*

      what a weekend!  i'm just back to work today.  i needed to recover from the superbowl and the parade.  the game was fabulous!  they pulled it off...i knew they were going to win.  i just couldn't fathom them having the season they did and then having it end with a superbowl loss.  it just wasn't going to happen!  what a close game too...my nails are bitten off and i kept falling off the edge of my seat while i watched it!  i didn't think the commercials were as good as in the past, but then again, i might not have really been paying attention...i could have been mixing myself a drink.  and what was up with the halftime show?  i totally missed the "boob reveal", but heard about it the next day.  totally inappropriate if it was planned.  it's primetime and children were watching.  shame on janet!  personally, i don't care what she does...but that wasn't the time nor the place for her rating shenanigans!  then the parade yesterday was outstanding (except for all the obnoxious, disrespectful teenagers that just wanted a day off of school).  i went with max, berna's husband.  we got in around 8:30-9 and marked territory on court street near the veteran's homeless shelter.  as we were standing there we made friends w/ some people and chatted to pass the time.  max went and got some posterboard and markers from staples across the street.  we figured we'd make signs since we had hours to kill.   we also let the little kids around us make signs too...they were psyched!  max had a football (with a sharpie attached to the laces, very prepared) that he wanted to try and get signed.  so i made a sign that read "sign his ball" with an arrow pointing to him.  during the parade i held it up and we managed to get david givens and teddy washington to sign it!   we were freaking out!  max threw it to each of them and they threw it back.   people couldn't believe they signed it.  the herald took my pic w/ the sign and took my name and everything, but i didn't see my pic in the paper, oh well!  my other signs said "MVT - most valuable team" and had all the numbers of the players on it and the other one said "PATS - perfect at the superbowl" and i drew the logo on it.    the trains afterwards were crazy!  we went and got something to eat to let south station thin out.  when we got back to south station around 3:30, it was still crazy!  luckily, i got the 4:10 out of boston.  max wasn't so lucky, he tried to get on the 3:45, but it was already full, so he had to wait.  john had a great trip.  he did manage to get a ticket into the big game.  he spent a lot of money, but said it was totally worth it.  he said the stadium was amazing and he was surrounded by other patriots fans.  he said his section kept doing the "and that's another patriot first down" with the arm signals and all.  the panther fans were looking at them like they were crazy...i guess they don't do that in the carolinas.  then again, they didn't get many first downs!    he brought home lots of souvenirs.  it isn't something you would do every year...but if the patriots do it next year...i'm going to go!!  :)

      go patriots!  i'm so glad that this day is finally here.  i'm sick of all the hype and analyzing that has gone on about this game.  just play the game already!  2 weeks is way too long between the playoffs and the superbowl.  i'm just so anxious...my insides are all up in arms waiting to watch this game.  i'm going to be a basketcase watching it!  i'm all decked out in my red, white and blue willie mcginest shirt, pats afc champs hat and i'm ready to go.  i have two parties today.  i made a cake for one of them with a spray painted patriots log on it.  it came out very cool!  *brb*  john just called from houston.  he hasn't gotten tickets yet.  they could have bought them yesterday for $1100, but they wanted to hold out until today to see if the price would go down any.  i really hope they get tickets.  another couple that i know got tickets on the 10 yard line in the nosebleed section for $1200 each!  yikes!    GO PATRIOTS!

      i haven't written anything lately, too tired, too lazy. not too much going on anyway.  john is still working on the dining room.  the french doors are in and look great.  we still have to stain them and paint the walls.  we ordered wall carpeting for our bedroom.  they came last monday to install it.  the color is called white bamboo, it's a neutral color.  the bedroom theme is a hawaiian/jimmy buffett theme, believe it or not.  i bought some bamboo mats for the tops of our nightstands and have decorate with palm tree frames and candle holders.  i even have a palm tree lamp!  the sign on the door reads "beach bungalow".  it's a fun bedroom!  i used some of my tax money to go shopping for clothes...which i desperately needed!  well, enough in "this" size to get me through the spring.  i'm hoping to be a smaller size by then...thus able to fit into all the clothes i have for the summer ;)  i also bought some more decorations for the house.    i've been spending tuesday evenings with my friend dawn.  it's become a ritual.  one of us prepares dinner and then we watch american idol.  we are such dweebs!  it's nice though to hang out and spend time together.  we live in the same town and never get to hang out.  she has two kids, so it can be hard.  lisa got herself, alison and i tickets to see prince in august.  lisa is a crazed fan!  it should be fun.  we saw him when he came to a very small rhode island venue.  we were very close up and personal.  this time, it is at the fleet center and we are in the nosebleed section!  that is all for now.  i will write more soon.  i just want people to know that i am still alive!

      i have done something today that i never do...i sat around and did nothing.  i've done nothing today.  zip, zero, zilch, nada, nothing.  well, i took a nap if that counts as doing something.  but, i pretty much categorize that as doing nothing.  i sat on the couch and channel surfed for a while too.  that is in the nothing category too.  i know it is ok to do nothing once in a while.  i feel guilty though about not doing things.  i get antsy when i'm not doing something productive.  i know there are a million things i could have done.  i could have cleaned, baked, scrapbooked, read a book, or organized my closet.  there are always things to be done...and today i chose to do none of them!!

      someone posted a signup to play speed chess at work during lunch.  this has prompted people to start playing all sorts of games during lunch; backgammon, trivial pursuit, scrabble, etc.  adriana and i have played scrabble the last three days.  the first day was just a practice round and yesterday i won with a score of 119!  today she won with a score of 132.  the rules state you can't use foreign words, but i sometimes try to break that rule.  i had some killer words but she wouldn't let me use them because they were foreign; nueva, nieva, adieu and i even had david.  she later tried to use 'rex'...which is latin for king.  i'm like, no way, dude...if i can't use spanish and french words, what makes you think i'm going to let you use latin words??  i played the word 'boar' and she started flipping out that you couldn't use animal words.  i'm like, what? what the hell version of scrabble have you been playing?  i think she was just trying to win.  i usually hate scrabble.  i don't like when you get cornered on the board and there is nowhere else to play a word.  but i think it is also because i'm usually playing with smaller children...so you never get words longer than 'be', 'the', 'you', 'see', sometimes you might get a 'play' in there.  so imagine my surprise when we were playing words like 'aioli', 'idiom', 'younger', and 'lancet'!!  rematch on friday!

      john started to rip apart the dining room this weekend. yay!  we plan on putting in french doors that open from the dining room into the formal living room, installing a chair rail, painting the walls and putting up a wallpaper border.  it was liveable the way it was, but we wanted to make it something that is 'us'.  the owners before us had this dancing bear motif going on.  we kept saying that the bears looked gay...not that there is anything wrong with that.  the bears just aren't us.    i want it to be sunny and inviting.  the theme is going to be sunflowers.  we need to choose between  urlLink this  border or  urlLink this  one.  either one will look wonderful with all of my sunflower decorations.  we plan on painting the wall a yellow above the chair rail and a maroon below it.  we still have to find the exact hues though.  i got a ton of those little square paint chip thingys from lowes and spread them out all over the table.  i'm way too overwhelmed at how many different shades of yellow and maroon there are!  so far, the old trim has been removed, the french door has been purchased and some framework has been done.  we are hoping to do the remodel for under $500.  that doesn't include the table saw that john had to buy.  another toy that he 'had' to have!!

      i swear all my weekends blur together.  we go out to eat and drink with friends.  i'm not saying that it isn't fun...but i need to liven it up a bit, do something else, like bowling or a movie.  friday night, it was dinner with john, berna, max, mary, and steve at my brother's restaurant.  i had an absolutely fantastic meal, broiled scallops, lobster tail and baked stuffed shrimp...big yums!  several drinks with dinner, including a pre-dinner sour apple martini.  from there we hit centerfield's, an old stomping ground of me and john's.  we met up with rob and angela there.  it was also karaoke night, so i sang a song or two just for old times sake.  several more beers were imbibed.    saturday night, john and i went out w/ his friend carl and his wife michelle.  we met at their house, which we found out is only 8 miles away from us...very convenient.  they have a very cute house on 3 acres of land.  we had dinner at the mendon jade.  carl and michelle are on a first name basis with the owner, which is why i think the scorpion bowls went straight to our heads.  they were definitely made with way more alcohol than usual.  we hit a texas themed bar afterwards.  i was excited to see that the billboard advertised karaoke.  i was drinking some blue concoction...which led me up to the microphone (yikes, twice in one weekend).  the only unfortunate thing about this was, i was definitely the worst singer.  i only do it because i think it is fun.  i'm not under any illusion that i'm good.  the other singers though were really good.  i mean some of them were almost american idol good.   i was the  urlLink 'william hung'  of the evening...well, that may be a little harsh for me...i'm not THAT bad.  we were all really bad by the end of the night, so john and i ended up crashing at carl & michelle's house.  we had huge heads in the morning.  why do we do that to ourselves?

      the rental car has been returned.  my car should be fixed by monday.  the insurance company is getting things wrapped up...though the other girl is now reporting an injury.  a broken finger!!  i know for a fact that it was broken before the accident.  patti heard her say it and that she just jammed it in the accident.  this whole accident, though fairly small, has turned into an enormous hassle.  nothing is ever easy, i swear!  i even had a problem returning the damn rental!!  i just want this all behind me.  i don't think i'm going to drive anywhere after this!

      it's been 9 days since my accident and it looks like my car might be fixed by friday...by the tune of $2800!  i'm still waiting to find out who was at fault me, the other girl or both.  apparently, the other girl is not using her insurance agency, but using mine.  she must be confident that it isn't her fault.  she also told my agent that i was too busy to hang around for the police that night, which is a total lie!  i told my agent that i waited 1 1/2 hrs. and called the police three times!  i thought it was a bit silly to wait around for the police when we could have just exchanged information and been on our way.  she is the idiot that that wouldn't give me her information and waited for 2 1/2 hrs. for the police.  that is just unacceptable in my book...luckily non one was hurt!  all of this is just one big friggin' annoyance to me.  it's like a scab that i have to keep picking...even though i don't want to and know it is going to bleed!

      my birthday was really nice.  john got me a couple of cow parade figurines…which i collect and this cool rooster that is holding a chalkboard.  our kitchen has a rooster theme and this fits in perfectly.  a place for us to leave each other messages.  a bunch of us went to eat at saraceno’s in the north end.  it is my favorite restaurant.  i have never had a bad meal there.  if you go, make sure to sit either in the basement or on one of the upper levels.  the main floor can get a bit busy and crowded.  the mussels and antipasto are great appetizers.  any of their veal dishes are good, as well as the eggplant parmesan and the lasagna.  the specials are usually great too!   after dinner we headed to the improve asyslum on hanover street.  it was a hoot, just like ‘who’s line is it anyway’!  there were a group of 5 or 6 actors/actresses that act out different things off the cuff.  they also had set skits that they acted out.  we had front row seats too!  bonus!  we were able to stay for the midnight show for free!  that show consisted of the cast drinking and playing three man!  they would let the audience make rules and then they would act that rule out in some way.  they were really very creative!

      so, my car is "deemed totaled".  don't laugh, but i always thought the word totaled just meant the car was so damn mangled that it was "totaled", you know.  for those of you wondering, yes, i am blonde.  i just have a little dent in my car, how is that totaled?  oh, i see, it costs more to fix the car than it's worth.  hmmm, i see.  well, it's worth a hell of a lot to me!  that is how i get from point a to point b.  i don't have a car payment.  that car was supposed to last a few more years!!!  yes, i know it is 10 years old and has over 136,000 miles on it...it still runs though!!  ugh!

      i found out today that the police finally arrived at 3:30am.  does it make any sense to anyone why we should have sat around for 2 1/2 hours for the police to come to take a report on a minor fender bender?  please, anyone!!  the other car actually stayed and made the report.  it will probably end up being my fault because i was making a u-turn.  no one is going to take into account that she wouldn't give me her insurance information or anything.  or if the driver of the car is the same person that gave the report.    i managed to get a rental car...a nice dodge stratus!  ooh ahh!  it is only going to cost me $10/day after what my insurance covers.  hopefully, i won't need the car for too long.  i found someone to do the auto body work too.  they came and towed it from my driveway.  the bad news is that his preliminary look at it tells him it might be totaled!  ugh! as john says, we just start to get ahead, and something else hits us.    since today is pretty much a holiday here...my claim hasn't been assigned yet and probably won't be until tomorrow, so i pretty much lose a day.  the adjustor needs to look at the car before any work is done.  c'est la vie!

      yup, i got into yet another car accident.  everyone always tells me i'm a terrible driver.  i've only been in one accident that was my fault!  how does that make ME a terrible driver?  all it tells me is that i attract all the idiots on the road!   it happened at 1am last night as we were heading home from our girls night out at the art bar in providence.  i was following signs for route 95 and then all of a sudden, the road veers to the right and the sign says route 195!  there was a do not enter sign in front of me and a street to my left, so i pulled a u-turn.  she came from the one way street behind me and we hit.  i pulled over as did the other driver when it happened.  there were 4 girls in that car,  and i had myself, patti and liz in my car.  it was really just a fender bender...my driverside front connecting with her front passengerside.  but, the driver refused to exchange information!  she wanted to call the police, which was fine with me.  i put my own call in too and  was told that they were very busy and it would be 20 minutes!  after 40 minutes went by, i called again.  after we had been there an hour and a half...we are all thinking this is ridiculous.  patti decides to call the police and find out what our obligation is...can we just give them my information and be on our way?  the police said that was all we were obligated to do.  we made sure to tell them that they wouldn't give me their information.  the police officer said to make sure to get their license plate then.  so, we did that.    as i pull away, i realize that my car isn't driveable.  the steering wheel keeps geting pulled out of my hand.  so, we pull into the gas station at the end of the street and we call triple a.  when the tow truck comes, the driver tells me he can only transport two of us!  patti had to call her brother to come pick her up and liz and i were going to go with the tow truck.  i'm beginning to think that this is the craziest night ever!  as the car was being hooked up, a police car came through the gas station and came over to us and asked if we called?  i'm like, yeah, 2 hours ago!  i explained everything that happened and he told me what i needed to do.  we asked if he could take patti to the biltmore hotel where her brother was going to pick her up and he said no problem, thank god!  i was freaking out becaue i didn't want to leave her by herself or send her in a cab.  she had to get in the back seat of the cruiser though!  that was a sight!  i wish i had taken a picture of that!  i didn't get home until 4am.  i don't think i even slept...i was up at 8:30am.  on top of all this, john wasn't home, but in montreal to see the bruins game.  needless to say, he wasn't going to be happy to hear about this!

      i've seen it all now!  a guy, a fairly normal looking guy,  i might add, peeing on the concourse of the red line at south station.  right as you come down the stairs, he was standing there, facing the stairs and partly sheltered by a column.  you couldn't see what he was doing until you got down to the platform...but in my mind, i'm thinking, this guy is trying to look all nonchalant, but i know he is peeing!  i couldn't believe it.  i think he was on his way to work; had a briefcase type bag.  he did have a walking cast on his leg, so maybe he didn't think he would make it to the bathroom.  again, the t, never a dull moment!

      so i'm going home on the t yesterday and i get on the train where there is hardly anyone on it.  there is this black organizer sitting on one of the seats.  i thought, oh, i should pick it up and give it to the t person so whoever lost it will get it back.  but i'm thinking, oh, let someone else do it, so i just sort of ignored it and sat down the other end of the train.  well, two stops later, they stop the train and announce that they are looking for a black leather organizer.  i'm like, great, someone will be happy!  so, i look down to where the organizer was to see if someone is getting up to bring it to the t person.  no one is moving.  i decide i will do my good deed for the day.  i go down there and it isn't on the seat, so i say to the people sitting in the area, oh, that organizer was around here earlier.  this one guy looks at me and says, it still is, and pulls it out of his bag?!?!?!  i said to him, they just made an announcement that they are looking for it.  i gave him a sneer and snatched the organizer out of his hand and turned it in.  what the hell was the guy gonna do with it?   take it home?  and do what with it?  he didn't strike me as the kind of guy that was going to turn it in to lost and found.  geesh, people!

      comments...ok, don't know why geoffrey called me a liar in my comments in my past post...but whatever.  today is april fool's day... i  was listening to waaf and they had this big thing on about how the hillman received this "memo" from the head honcho that they couldn't say the word 'nipple' on the radio.  the program director called a few times to reprimand him for saying it several times this morning.  finally, the gm called and suspended hillman and lb for the day.  spaz took over.  it was pretty funny, but i knew it had to be a joke.  same for the howard stern show.  i flipped over to that and i hear britney spears playing!  i'm like, what the f&^%?  i had heard that stern might be taken off the radio, but i knew there was no way they would replace it with a show like the one i was hearing!  and of course, that too was a joke.  the only thing i heard this morning that i don't know if it is a joke or not is that the driving age has been changed to 18.  is this true?  i had heard that the legislature was considering it.    vacation plans...john and i booked a cruise for next march.  we invited all of our friends on it too.  we figured that gives people plenty of time to save money for it.  the last cruise i went on was with 22 people and it was a complete blast.  right out of our office....someone stole a bunch of matchbox cars that a guy at work collects.  he had them displayed on his desk in a locked room!  the weirdest part is that some were still in their packages and this person ripped open the packages, took the cars and left the packages on the desk.  our only thought is the cleaning people, because they are the only people that have the key to that room.  *hmm  and what's up for this weekend?...i'm going to newport this weekend with a bunch of girlfriends from high school.  i haven't seen a lot of them in a long time.  unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the weather is going to cooperate...but you really don't need nice weather to eat and drink!

      john said i could be in charge of planting flowers in the window boxes this year.  so, that was my job this weekend.  i do not have a green thumb whatsoever, not even a greenish hue exists.  i went to the nursery, picked out a bunch of flowers that i thought would look nice together and estimated how many i would need for four window boxes.  when i got home, john asked me how much i spent.  i told him $65.  it was actually $75, but i had a $10 off coupon.  he thought that was rather high, he figured i would spend around $30.  i guess i bought too many flowers.  there were a few left over.  not to worry though, they won’t go to waste.  i plan on planting them in the wooden keg barrels we have.  i have visions; it is just carrying them out that seem to be the problem.  i will probably need to buy some more flowers to add to the leftovers to fill the barrels.  and god knows how much potting soil i will need.  i couldn’t believe the amount of soil the window boxes took!  it seems a waste to spend money on dirt!  the window boxes and barrels will be good practice though.  john will be building retaining walls around two trees in our yard where we plan on putting big flower beds.  i better start finding that green thumb…fast!

      i never used to drink coffee much.  maybe once in a while, just for something to drink with dessert.  then a few years ago, i had a cinnamon coffee from dunkin donuts and i was hooked!  i couldn’t get enough of it.  i would have one every day.  unfortunately, it was a seasonal coffee for the wintertime.  i was distressed once march came around.  i was jonesing for a coffee though.  so i tried the french vanilla.  i was hooked on that for a long time as well.  as you can see i’m hooked on flavored coffee…don’t give me any of that ‘regular’ coffee…blech!  and god forbid that friendly little dunkin donut girl gives me the wrong coffee and i don’t find out until i’ve walked all the way back to work!  one time, i marched myself right back to the store and had them give me another one!  nothing is worse than taking a sip of what you expect to be french vanilla and get that foul tasting regular coffee taste!!  so what’s my craving now?  the caramel iced coffee.  yum!  though once already i was given the iced caramel latte, which is totally different.  i had to throw it away it tasted so awful.

      i met my stepmother the other night to get my dad’s old newspaper clippings, forms and documents from when he was in world war 2.  many of the newspapers are old, frayed and yellowed, but i am able to glean much information from them.  i hope to be able to restore or at least preserve what i have.  i plan on making copies for my brothers also.  my dad was a pow/mia in Rumania.  one of the pieces of memorabilia i have is a western union telegram informing my dad’s mom (whom had passed away way before i was born) that he had been reported missing!  imagine the dread she must have felt receiving that. the newspaper clippings outline where he was, what he did, and what happened to him.  it is truly amazing the things he did.  he was an aerial gunner on a b-24 liberator.  he flew 30 missions and was part of the bombing of the ploesti oil fields.  he was part of the 15th aaf, 376th bomber group and the 513th squadron.  he was only 21 years old at the time!  there are all sorts of front page news stories about his rescue and return to the states.  some of the documents have names of other men that were enlisted with my dad.      i’ve become engrossed in research on the web about the war, his time in it and possibly finding some of these men he toured with.  i have signed up on some yahoo groups and found sites pertaining to his bomber group.  i hope find out if his plane had a name.  many of them did…sweet meat, the wench, lady be good, and the brewery wagon to name a few.  it is all very fascinating.  one of the most amazing things was that he received the soldier’s medal for heroism!  here is what the citation states:   “for heroism at great risk of life during the period from 24 august to 26 august 1944.  volunteering to evacuate wounded american flyers who had been interned in an enemy prison hospital in rumania, these gallant men, during an intense and heavy bombardment and strafing attack lasting continuously for over forty-eight hours, carried wounded personnel to air-raid shelters and also carried medical supplies, bedding, food and clothing from blasted and burning buildings in order to insure the comfort and safety of the patients.  regardless of incessant sniping, strafing and bombing, these men with complete disregard for their own safety, were instrumental in saving the lives of countless american and allied wounded personnel.  by their superb courage, valor, and devotion to duty, these men have upheld the highest traditions of the military service, thereby reflecting great credit upon themselves and the armed forces of the united states of america.”   only 17 other men received it.  i read this excerpt to my brother, who was in the navy, and he couldn’t believe it...our dad was a hero and he never even talked about it!  my dad was enlisted in the army (or aaf back then) from 1942-1945.  in addition to the soldier’s medal, he also wore an air medal with an oak leaf cluster, the european theatre of operations ribbon with two stars which denote his part in the italian campaign and the air offensive over europe, three bronze stars, and an aerial gunner badge.  i am very proud of my dad and his efforts for america during that time.

      where did chili's go?  the harvard square chili's has up and left...no warning, just a note on the door saying "thank you for your patronage!"  the awnings are gone and the sign is gone!  i was never a huge fan of the place because there service was way too slow (i mean i only have an hour for lunch, you know) and the food wasn’t always prepared to the best of their ability.  but still, no more country fried chicken, no more buffalo chicken salad, no more guiltless grills, and no more presidente margaritas!  i actually called the chili’s hotline to see if i could find out why they closed.  all they could tell me is that the store closed on may 10th at 3pm.  they said most likely it was staffing issues or that the store didn’t meet their high financial expectations.  i heard a rumor that the landlord wouldn’t fix the roof so chili’s said “no more fajitas for you” and moved out!    so, that is one less place to go eat in the square…the pickin’s are getting slim around here!

      stupid me watched the video of berg being beheaded by the psychotic, insane, fanatical fuckers!  they are barbarians!  i became physically ill.  i don't know why i watched it...because it was there?  is that an excuse?  there are no words to describe how gruesome and ghastly the video is.  i don't recommend watching it.  this war is only going to get worse and worse.  i'm not a big political person and i try not to discuss politics because i just don't know enough about them to have an intelligent conversation.  all i can say is how i feel.  i feel awful for all the people who have to die; i feel horrible for the families of these people;  i feel terrible for the children of today growing up in such an evil and cruel world.  my heart goes out the soldiers that are in iraq and afghanistan, fighting to try and make our world a safer place.    my friend barbara's father-in-law is leaving today to go to fallujah.  he is a 57 year-old grandfather on blood pressure medication.  does it make sense to send him over there now?  probably about as much sense as it makes to send a 21 year-old son over.  i pray for his safety and that he will one day return home to see his children and grandchildren again.  PEACE

      this is my favorite one:  memories light the corners of my mind misty water-colored memories of the way we were  scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind smiles we gave to one another for the way we were.  can it be that it was all so simple then or has time rewritten every line if we had the chance to do it all again, tell me, would we, could we  memories may be beautiful and yet what's too painful to remember we simply choose to forget so it's the laughter we will remember whenever we remember the way we were.  the way we were.

      what are your earliest memories?  my earliest memories are both from kindergarten, both bad.  i was 5 years old and i was in miss gugliatta’s class at the shattuck school.  we were supposed to draw a circle inside of a square and for some ‘blonde’ reason, i just didn’t get it.  the teacher was taping paper up on the windows while we were working on this certain project.  i raised my hand for help.  she tried to show me how to do it by holding the masking tape roll inside the window…a circle inside a square.  i still didn’t get it for a while.    the other horrible memory happened during puzzle time. i was putting the puzzle that i was working on away.  as i walked by miss ‘meanie’ gugliatta, she noticed there was a piece missing.  she asked me where the missing piece was.  i told her the piece was missing when i started the puzzle.  she didn’t believe me and made me search the classroom for the puzzle piece while my classmates sat in their seats and watched.  how humiliating!!!  that piece could have been missing for 5 years for all i knew.  after an appropriate amount of time, according to meanie, had passed, she had me sit down and then announced, “now you all know the consequences if you lose a puzzle piece!”  great teaching skills, huh?  i’m sure i’m scarred for life from that one.  maybe that is why i’m petrified to lose anything!

      23 years ago this month, my mom passed away.  it amazes me that i’ve been without her for that long.  i had just turned 13.  i remember i used to be jealous of my brothers because, being older than me; they had her in their lives for a longer time.  i was born when my mom was 40.  apparently, my dad cheated on my mom at some point and i was the “make up” baby.  my aunt told me this years later, when she felt i was old enough to understand.  (thanks auntie…something i really wanted and needed to know.)  that would probably explain why my mom used to always tell me that the only reason she was alive was for me.  i was her sole reason for living.  that is a lot of pressure to put on a child.   i remember soon after her passing that my dad and i moved into an apartment.  the apartment didn’t allow pets so we had to give up our dog cleo to the animal control officer.  i was devastated…no mom, no dog.  my life was shattering around me.  then my dad remarried within a short time and the stepmom moves in with us.  now mind you, my father never really explained what was going on, it just happened.  so i of course resented this woman.  i’m 13!  i had always been daddy’s little girl.  now, i was cast off to the side and things were way different!  of course i’m not going to like some strange woman coming into my life, so i didn’t treat her very nicely.  i pretty much kept to myself and did whatever i wanted.  i never got into trouble either, surprisingly.  i always forged ahead in life doing what i thought my mom would want me to.  i actually adopted my friend dawn’s parents.  i was always at her house anyway.  i was pretty much on my own at that point.  the only way i could really communicate with my dad was to write notes.  i would write how i felt about the situation and how i didn't like it or understand it.  usually, he would just get angry.  there was one time he just pretty much said to me, "you will like her and treat her nicely".  when i look back on this, i feel bad for my dad.  i know he tried his best.  when he passed away 14 years ago, i was old enough to realize, that yeah, i’m glad he had someone and wasn’t alone.  i get along fine enough with my stepmother now…though i only see her once or twice a year, if that.  she wasn’t a big part of my life, as far as i’m concerned.  i’m actually meeting her for dinner next week.  my brothers and i want my dad’s newspaper articles, clippings and memorabilia from his pow/mia time during world war 2.  he was a turret gunner on a b-24 liberator.  i don’t really know much about that period of my dad’s life because i wasn’t even a thought yet.  some of my memories:      i used to run across the street to clarke’s pharmacy every morning and get toast for breakfast for my mom and me before i went off to school.  they knew me by name there.   she always drank tab and used to smoke lucky strikes (until she went cold turkey).   my dad too smoked…marlboros (until he too went cold turkey…talk about slamming cabinets and doors!!)  my mom worked at the town diner as a waitress.  my dad worked at bird & son for over 25 years.  my mom once called the police because she didn’t know where i was.  i happened to be a block away, swimming at my friend’s house!  i would rub my mom’s feet for her and we would watch soap operas together.   she always had the most elaborate birthday cakes for me.    thursdays were mcdonald’s night.  dad would come home from work with the mcdinner.    dad brought me on a 2 week vacation to disney world for my birthday one year.  i used to dress cleo up in my clothes.  i was really spoiled being the youngest and only girl.  my brother used to tease me because i got good grades.  my oldest brother was already out of the house when i was born, so i really don't know him that well at all.  my mom used to go to georgia's salon to get her hair done in this cool up-do with curls that stood up on her head.  i’ve never seen another woman with that hairstyle.  mom played bingo almost every night…it was her love!  mom was one to speak her mind.  everyone in town knew and loved my mom.    i do miss my mom & dad and think about them a lot.  i often wonder how different i might have turned out if both of them were still around.  i believe they would be proud of me.

      'Tiffani (with an 'i', naturally) had a hard time integrating into the 'real world' when her career as an exotic dancer ended. She landed a job at the local grocery store for a while, but got fired because she ' kept pulling a "janet jackson" as she asked for price checks over the microphone '.

      i have my baby back (that would be me car)!  i hope that it lasts me as long as realistically possible.  the scare of almost having to buy a new car has me driving like a grandma!  i am practically afraid to drive now.  john says that the next time i have an accident, it’s not going to matter who is at fault…the ultimate outcome will be a totaled car.  the poor thing is 10 years old and has over 136,000 miles on it.  i got the car in the divorce back in ’99 and have never had a car payment, so buying a new car and having a car payment would not be a good thing right now.  so, if you see a dark green infiniti g20 in front of you going way slower than the speed limit or braking to the point of over cautiousness, give me a break, ok?

      the wake and the funeral were distressing affairs.  tons of people came to pay their respects to john’s grandfather.  he was very well known in the community, even mayor menino came.  everytime i saw someone crying, i would start crying.  they had a bagpiper performing outside of the church where the service was held.  he grew up in that church, which was located around the corner from the house that he lived in all his life.  the line of cars in the procession stretched far while we were escorted by three state police cars and several police motorcycles.    the day was full of telling stories and tales about this great man.  john’s grandpa was a class act.  i only met him a few times since john and i have been together, but you could tell he was a kind and gentle man.  he never cussed in his 94 years of life.  he loved his family, his house, the neighborhood, his garden and the beach.  he was laid back, funny, loving and had a huge heart.  you can see that all of those characteristics have been passed on to his 6 children, down to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  there will be a huge hole in their lives and the many others that he touched.  the family christmas party won’t be the same because he won’t be there to play santa, but his memory will live on in everyone’s hearts.

      this morning, a man on the T commented on my shoes.  he said, "those are a lovely pair of sandals".  hmmm, sounds like he may have a foot fetish.  i find it odd that he went out of his way to compliment my shoes.  i always thing people have an ulterior motive and aren't just being nice.  or am i just paranoid?

      the girls had a great time at biker weekend this year!  we always do though!  me, liz, patti, charlene, jeanne and anglea.  we met lots of people, hung out, drank and ate, drank and ate - oh, i already said that, didn't i?  the weather cooperated, for a change, this year.  it was shitty the past few years.  we went to the camel tent during the day on friday and listened to a lynyrd skynyrd tribute band, 'another saturday night special'.  the lead singer hung out with us while he was on break and showed us some pictures of some of the late members of lynyrd skynyrd that he used to know.  that was pretty cool.    i have to give props to the porta-potty-cleaner-guys.  the porta-pottys there are the cleanest damn porta-pottys i've ever seen at any such event, especially with what they are dealing with.  they even have running water...bonus!    on the way home from the tent, my sandal broke.  my favorite smelly shoes, that i wear every day :(  that was my complaint for the rest of the afternoon.  i seem to always be complaining about something.  while i was complaining, we met 'big john' on our travels down lakeside ave.  he was a very HUGE guy, maybe 300 lbs.  maybe i shouldn't speculate on his weight...trust me, he was a big guy.  he unfortunately, got to listen to the rest of my sandal-breaking spew.  we went to the paradise beach club on weirs beach friday night and saw a band called 'the bars'.  we bumped into 'big john' again.  i made fun of some people...there was the 'budweiser-short-sportbilt-wearing-get-me-out-of-the-80's' guy, 'the-loner-i'm-all-set-then-come-hang-out-with-us-and-buy-us-shots' guy.  we (me) drank a lot causing me to hang a bit on saturday morning.  the haze didn't lift until after noontime!  during the day on saturday, the girls went to naswa, while i went on a ride with 'big john'.  i don't think you could even see me on the back of the bike!  we just tooled around a little bit and met some of his friends.  saturday night we went to goodfellas which is in downtown laconia, to see 'standing man'.  they are one of our favorite bands...unfortunately, though, they are breaking up.  this was 'the-meet-20-something-year-olds' night.  for some reason, all of the young guys wanted to hang out with us.  josh, sal, john, joe, scott to name a few.  charlene wanted to take them home!  we felt really good about ourselves ;) liz especially had a following of 'oglers' (hey bucky!).    i really wish i had the ability to post pictures on this site, but i don't whaaa!  :(  i know some of you reading this, have no idea what i'm talking about and i probably just sound like i'm completely babbling...but many of you do get what the hell i'm saying, right?

      the (fuckface) ex and his (bitchy) wife (see you next tuesday) are expecting a (cranky) child on august 30th.  they (ass & skank) are expecting a boy.  the poor thing doesn't know what kind of life awaits him (his parents being the definition of horrid *that is probably being too kind*).   ok, i have nothing against the child.  i may have gone a little, teensy bit overboard with my feelings.  i will feel bad for the child, really.  at least i know he will have one set of very nice grandparents and a very kind aunt!

      work has been hellish.  we just migrated one of our servers from novell to windows 2000.  yes, we expected things to break, people to not have read the e-mails that we've been sending out for months telling them of this migration, and all out chaos to break out...it is tiring.    so, this leads into a nice long weekend.  friday i'm off to laconialand...home of biker weekend!  the girls will be ripping up the place :)  it will be a nice little getaway...checking out the bikes, going to the clubs at night and whatever else comes our way!

      does anyone else out there talk to themselves?  i mean a lot.  i mean, like so much you want you to shutup?  today has been bad.  i keep talking to myself, in my head, about the same things over and over again.  it’s like i’m trying to keep myself from forgetting these things.  i wouldn’t care if the things were real important things, but they aren’t.  these are the thoughts going through my head over and over again today:  i’m going to curves after work i will do the circuit 3 times i need to pay them for next month i need to eat something good for dinner i will throw out the leftover spaghetti because it is old i will wear my new outfit tomorrow if it is cooler than today i will eat my apple for snack at 3ish  rinse and repeat!

      i'm back from my rendezvous to detroit, mi for my 10 year service recognition dinner!  the  urlLink detroit airport  is huge!  when i landed, i just started following the luggage claim signs.  after about 10 minutes of walking, i’m like where the hell is the baggage claim?  this is when i noticed that they have a monorail that i could have taken.  they also have moving sidewalks which are pretty cool.  the limo driver who picked me up from the airport talked the whole way to the hotel and kept calling me ”m’am”.  this is him talking…picture an older black gentleman with a southern accent talking really fast and instead of saying ‘er’ at pauses, he would say, ‘know what i’m sayin’.  “i call everyone m’am, ‘know what i’m sayin’, doesn’t mean you are old, i can tell you are a young lady, ‘know what i’m sayin’, but i’m a 62 year old retired man of 30 years form the chrysler corporation, ‘know what i’m sayin’, i call all woman m’am, so don’t be offended, ‘know what i’m sayin’.”  he was trying to avoid traffic and took me on a scenic route of detroit that included a rundown trailer park and mexicantown.  he kept telling me which routes and roads he was taking, like i knew where the hell i was going.  i think he was trying to make me feel safe and that he wasn’t planning on doing anything funny.  he also noted that i don’t want to walk around the area alone at night.  the half hour ride took a little over 45 minutes.  i stayed at the  urlLink marriott at the renaissance center .  you can’t really tell by this picture on their website, but there are 4 circular towers with one big circular tower in the middle (gm is housed here).  it was wicked confusing trying to get around the damn place.  it took me 15 minutes one time to find my way out!    my room looked out over the detroit river and the  urlLink ambassador bridge  which takes you to canada.  i was only going to be here one night, so i really didn’t have much time to sightsee, though i noticed quickly that there wasn’t really that much to see.  i walked through greektown and past some casinos.  during some of the shuttle bus rides from the hotel, headquarters and dinner, i glimpsed ford and comerica fields.  i walked around a bit and took some pictures, but it was so damn hot, i preferred staying in the air conditioned room.  a nap was due since i had been up since 3am!    the out of towners were able to take a tour of headquarters.  you can see some pictures  urlLink here .  the building is just over a year old and boasts a water feature designed by the same company that did one for the bellagio hotel and the olympics, a  kick ass gym with a suspended track, a daycare that is registered for 325 kids and a great cafeteria.  i also got to meet people in my department..finally putting a face to the voice.   the dinner on monday night was held at the  urlLink max m. fisher music center  and was very nice.  they had a jazz quartet during the "open bar" cocktail hour.  then the  urlLink mosaic singers  performed a number during dinner where they supplied unlimited wine.  each of us was called up individually to receive a picture frame that will be used for the group picture they took that evening. after dinner a bunch of us went back to the hotel bar and had some drinks and watched the stanley cup finals.  after that, i went back to my room and ordered a $14 pizza from room service!!!  i wish i hadn’t done that!  oh and did i mention, i'm a centerpiece person...meaning, i always want the centerpiece.  well, i took the centerpiece after much deliberating with friends on the bus.  i ran back in and took one.  i took all the flowers out of the vase, wrapped them up and took them home on the 614 mile plane ride!   yesterday, my plane was delayed an hour because they had maintenance problems.  they sent us from gate a6 to a77 to board another plane.  luckily, i now knew about the monorail system :)  i got lost driving home though, so i didn't get home until almost 7 last night. zzzzzzzzzz….

       urlLink Evite  this is a very cool site!  you can send out invitations to anything to as many people as you want.    it lets you set up the whole invitation, anyway you want.  first you choose the kind of invitation you want, include when and where and then send it to who you want.  you can even import your address book from outlook into the site making the invite list easy to address.  then, the invitation is sent and the invitees open the site and reply with yes, no, or maybe along with the ability to add a comment.  now, all i have to do is login to my evite site and see who's coming!!  makes my "julie the cruise director" life easier!

      i'm digging the new song,  heaven , by los lonely boys.  i have a caramel iced coffee from d&d and i swear it tastes like the milk is sour.  :(  i have a new little purse for biker weekend that my friend made me.  it is black with red, orange and yellow flames all over it.  how totally cool!  it will match my flame sneakers and flame shirt!  i will be ' on fire ' (must say 'on fire' like the guy says 'i'm spicy' in that burger king commercial)!  our cat, chloe, seems to be meowing an abnormal amount lately.  i don't know if she is just getting old and senile, or she is just wicked needy lately.  i like listening to her meow, but i don't like being woken up by it at 4am!!!  i have a chance to see the sneak preview of the new harry potter movie on saturday...at  7:15am !!  why the ungodly hour??  i so have to clean my desk...it is a dustbowl!  tomorrow is friday!  woo f'in hoo!  i kind of have a long weekend.  i will be in detroit on monday and tuesday for my 10 year service recognition dinner.  whoppee!  they pay for me to fly out to our headquarters, have a dinner, stay in a hotel and then fly me back home the very next day.  the whirlwind tour of detroit.  is there anything really to see there anyway?  i don't have anything to wear yet to the above shindig...hopefully, i will find something this weekend...nothing like waiting until the last minute!  i've had to pee for like the last 10 minutes, but once i start something on the computer, i force myself to sit and finish it.  ok, was that tmi?

      patti told me she has a lot of deer and fisher cats living in the woods behind her house.&nbsp; i had never heard of a fisher cat.&nbsp; she had never actually seen one, but had been told that&nbsp;they look like an otter but&nbsp;taller.&nbsp; they are also&nbsp;pretty vicious and they eat dogs and cats!  &nbsp;  well, while laying out in the sun on sunday, i heard some sort of scuttlebut going on in the underbrush.&nbsp; i got up to see what the commotion was and saw a black animal that looked like a cat.&nbsp; it was running circles around something and chasing it all over the place.&nbsp; thinking it was a cat chasing a mouse or something, i started clapping my hands at it because i didn't want it to kill whatever it was.&nbsp; it didn't stop right away, but then it did and looked up at me...it was not a cat!!&nbsp; it had pricked up ears with a snout and beady eyes...it was one of these friggin' fisher cats, so i ran in the house like a little girl!!&nbsp; ha ha!&nbsp; i told patti about it when she got home and she was all pissed because she has lived there for about a year and&nbsp;has yet to&nbsp;see one.&nbsp; i'm there for a few hours and the fisher cat decides to show itself to me!  &nbsp;  here is all you would want to know about a  urlLink fisher cat !   urlLink  &nbsp;

      this was a busy weekend for me and john, but separately.&nbsp; john went to york, pa with his motorcycle club.&nbsp; on thursday, they drove 525 miles to york; on friday, they took a tour of the harley-davidson manufacturing plant, drove to gettysburg and did some sightseeing and then drove to strousburg.&nbsp; on saturday they completed their journey home. &nbsp; i went out with a bunch of people to castaways in bridgewater to see the infractions play and ended up staying over berna and max's house.&nbsp; i don't think the last two margaritas helped my cause.&nbsp; saturday, i scrapbooked with peggy, patti, jeanne and angela.&nbsp; we had a bite to eat at&nbsp;carrabbas.&nbsp; i stayed up in the nh area at patti and kirk's because we were going to a benefit on sunday for the bass player&nbsp;of this band we go to&nbsp;see all the time, standing man, who has cancer.&nbsp; it was being held at debbie's lakeview lounge in dracut.&nbsp; there were about 7 bands that played for an hour each, raffles and a buffett.&nbsp; it was a good time and i think&nbsp;a good amount of money was raised.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Let's try some 'true or false' questions this week!  1. I like my job.  FALSE - it's ok.  i'm comfortable being here almost 11 years.  the commute really sucks though!  2. I find time to 'smell the flowers' so to speak.   TRUE - i definitely do the things i want to do...i may be 'smelling the flowers' quickly, but i smell them!  3. I have no problem thinking of things to write about in my blog.   FALSE - it seems i can never think of anything profound to write about like a lot of other bloggers.  i'm freestyle!  i don't have a political bone in my body, i don't feel so strongly about something to write pages about...but i can surely write about things going on in my life.  4. 'Organization' is my middle name!   TRUE - everything has to be in its place.  i love order.  5. If 'Plan A' doesn't work, there's always a 'Plan B.' TRUE - always have a backup plan...always!  6. I adjust easily to new surroundings. TRUE - i can be anywhere at anytime and fit right in.  i'm flexible...i'm gumby!  7. I'd rather work 'behind the scenes' than 'in the spotlight.' FALSE - i love, love, love to be in the spotlight...hence karaoke...give me a microphone and i will take the stage!  8. I'm happy where I am, at this point in my life. TRUE - i'm definitely enjoying my life right now.  things may be different than i thought they would be, but there is where the new surrounding thing comes in.  9. I can wake up in the morning without an alarm clock. TRUE - i always set it though, just in case.  most times i wake up before it goes off though.  it couldn't be because of chloe meowing or the damn dogs next door barking their heads off, could it?  10. I can function pretty well on less than 8 hours of sleep. TRUE - i like my sleep, but i really don't need that much.  now, if we were talking about john...he would need 18 hours of sleep!

      we held our 2nd annual pool/bbq party this weekend.  what a blast!  as a surprise, john hired a one-man band for live entertainment.  he is actually the lead singer of "the shoes" if anyone has heard of them.  it felt like happy hour!  he invited people up to sing if they felt like it.  you know i was all over that!    there was tons of food and about 100 people showed up, 30 or so of them kids.  everyone had a blast swimming, drinking, eating and just hanging out!  it is a lot of work and costs a lot of money to pull off one of these parties, but it is totally worth it.  i love getting friends together and having a good time.  my roommate from freshman year came with her family.  she says she hasn’t seen me in 9 years!  how pathetic is that?  other highlights...24 oz. budweisers, karaoke, skinny dipping, kelli & jodi's chocolate martinis, john shooting a chocolate martini (kids, don't try that at home!), the creepy neighbor guy, john getting very drunk, where is mike's car?   here are some pictures of the bash!   urlLink       me, berna and tammy trying to sing with dave. you can see me holding the 24 oz. beer!   urlLink       the kids having fun in the pool.   urlLink       the smoking section!

      i’ve been listening to waaf, wbcn, wbru and whjy a lot lately.  there are several rocker-type bands out there right now that i’m liking a lot…like jet, white stripes, three days grace, velvet revolver, alter bridge, audioslave and shinedown.  i like all types of music and usually channel surf.  at work though, i usually leave my radio on wbmx, which i have to say is wearing on me…they play the same songs over and over again.  so, this week, i’m forcing my radio at work to pick up waaf…it looks like i have a high-tension wire in my cube!  damn those low wattage stations…forget about tuning wfnx in.

      *had the neighbors over for drinks. *laid out in the sun and swam in my pool. *attended bbq at berna’s sister’s house, where much eating and drinking took place. *watched fireworks from steve’s restaurant. *we took pleasure in the imbibing of cocktails. *attended another pool party, this one at my cousin kathy and al’s . *watched the parade in the sweltering sun. *hung out with all of my cousins who i haven’t seen in a while, all who are hysterical! *made many jaunts back to the house to replenish our cups. *borrowed a shirt so i could go swimming, my white shirt would not have been appropriate at a family party. *swam in the pool w/ my clothes on. *wore a towel around until my clothes were dry. *enjoyed more food and libations. *played with cousin kerry’s two cutie kids. *let the kids shoot water into my face through a fish float, which they thought was hysterical. *cousin denise and i sang “some kind of wonderful” with the band. *fireworks were set off by the neighborhood. *singed my arm with a sparkler…not one of those little ones, it was a big ass sparkler that you could wave around! *found one of the kids glow bracelets on the ground, which made me happy (though all the glow is out of it now). *cousin denise didn’t want to go home when her ride was leaving. *more beverages were passed around as were some other illegal substances. *cousin denise explained safe sex to a couple of nineteen year olds…with props (don’t ask)! *i drove her home and stayed at auntie dottie’s. *got a terrible nights sleep. *auntie dottie and cousin denise made breakfast. *i made a dunkin donuts run for coffee, which was very badly needed.

      a woman on the T told me she loved my flip flops this morning!  then she proceeded to tell me that i can go down to this lebanese jeweler on washington street and get some gorgeous indian-style earrings to match.  she said he sells jewelry based on how he feels about the customer!  if he gets good vibes, he will give a bigger discount.  he'd lose a lot of money on me, because i'm just stock full of damn good vibes!

      my gym membership has been on hold for the 3 months.  they told me to call back at the end of june if i would like to put it on hold for longer.  i’ve been meaning to call all week.  well, today, i noticed that the gym charged my monthly fee to my checking account.  oh shit!  i didn’t know they would just automatically start charging me again!   so, i called the gym and the person i need to talk to isn’t in, of course.  so now i have to wait until tomorrow. i pray to god they reimburse me!!!!   update: nope, they didn't reimburse me.  apparently, i have to give 30 days notice, so that is my 30 days notice.  whatever!

      i know it has been a little quiet around here since the ‘big announcement’.  lots has been going on though.  we’ve been discussing ideas on when and where we’d like to have our ceremony and reception.  neither of us necessarily cares to have the traditional church-rent-a-hall type wedding.  plus, we are paying for this on our own.  that is why we thought it would be unique to get married on the cruise or an island and then have a big catered party at our house.  john’s mother was fine with that…at first.  not so fine with it when the subject was brought up again when we went over there the other night.  she started crying, saying she wants to see her oldest son get married!  i was flabbergasted!  what do you say?  i felt horrible.  when we got in the car, i said to john, what was all that about?  he’s like, i told you she could be difficult.  he said he is going to get married on the cruise just to spite her.  i don’t think so, i said.  we need to take your parents feelings into account here.  she only gave birth to you, got you through some really tough times when you were a child and seen you grow into a great man.  i think you owe her this much to let her see you get married.  now we are looking at a yacht that goes out of mystic, ct.  the only thing is that it only holds 80 people which means we would have to significantly cut our invite lists down to meet that requirement.  i would rather just have my immediate family and friends there than my extended family.  i hardly ever see my extended family.  why should i pay for a party for them?  does that sound harsh?  i would like to only invite the aunts, uncles and cousins that i see the most.  there are some that i haven’t seen in over 6 or so years!!  so, the date and place is still up in the air.  i will keep you updated as plans get solidified.

       what a restful and relaxing vacation i had. we hung out at the campground a lot, ate and drank a lot, took some day trips to boothbay harbor and rockland. we pretty much did whatever came to our minds at the time. it’s nice to be away and not know what time or even what day it is! it was great!     on friday, we rode the motorcycle up to acadia and bar harbor. it was a 2 ½ hour ride and my butt and legs hurt by the time i got there. i had never been there before. it is absolutely beautiful! we drove to the top of cadillac mountain and walked around. you could see all the little islands and bar harbor from the pinnacle. this is where john  proposed  to me. yes, people, i’m off the market ;) he totally surprised me and it was a perfect moment. the ring is absolutely gorgeous! he picked it out all by himself too. it is white gold with a diamond in the center and one on each side.  i couldn’t be happier !    the first people to know were our camping buddies. we celebrated at our campsite that night. one couple went out and got a cake and champagne, while the little girls put on a skit imitating john asking me to marry him. it was precious! we had a roaring campfire with about 12 of us hanging out. we were up until 1am, even though quiet hours start at 11pm. that would be why we were spoken to twice to keep our voices down. hey, we’re celebrating here…leave us alone! it’s not every day that someone gets engaged while camping.    the next day, a stranger went by and said, are you the couple that got engaged? i said, how do you know. she said it is all over the campground! nothing is sacred anymore.
