      Last night I spoke with my eldest son, TJ, who is 10.  We had a few laughs, I think he's got my sense of humo(u)r.  He had been to Tulsa to visit his aunt, who works in the media there, and was back on his way to Texas when I called.    It's extremely bittersweet when I speak to him on the phone, I feel so much love for my first-born son, but I've not seen him in ages and it's gut wrenching.  Absentee parenting sucks.    I think about TJ every day, wonder what he's doing, what things make him happy, sad, angry.  I dread calling because I almost feel like I'm a stranger to him, not an active part of his life, and then I miss him terribly.   This much I know: I need to see him soon.

      The canoe trip on the Styx River, near Elsanor (yes, that's how the town's name is spelled) Alabama, started out innocently enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; We paid our money to the guy, a retired Navy Master Chief, and launched the canoe into the water, complete with cooler (snacks and water only this time, saving the beer for the adults only trip), Chloris, Boo and Me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Not many people on the river, as this was a weekday, and the thunderstorms from the day before kept most would-be river rats at home.&nbsp; According to the man at  urlLink Kicks On The Styx ,&nbsp; if we just floated with the current and steered the canoe, it'd take us 3 hours to get back to the landing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would end up taking a great deal longer.  &nbsp;  Chloris rode in the front of the canoe, Boo in the middle with the cooler, and I was the captain and helmsman at the back.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a family parked under the first bridge we came to, and the damned kids tried to swim directly in front of the damned canoe.&nbsp; As I manouvered hard left to avoid them, I couldn't correct our course in time to avoid slamming poor Chloris into some overhanging branches on the bank.&nbsp; She wasn't injured, merely annoyed to the point of verbally chastising me.&nbsp; Mishap #1 complete.  &nbsp;  The weather looked lovely, slightly overcast with light blue in between the cracks in the clouds.&nbsp; It looked like we'd not encounter any foul weather.&nbsp; Unless 95 degree heat is foul.&nbsp; There was plenty of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As we came around a bend in the river, I saw a beaver dive off a branch and into the water.&nbsp; First time I'd ever seen one in the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't see the turtle on the log next to it, but Chloris did, and insisted I paddle the canoe backwards against the current so we could all get a look at it.&nbsp; This I did, against my better judgement, and we did see the turtle.&nbsp;  We also got the current broadside, and it swept us, with me now at the impact edge, into a tree that would have at least given me a nasty knock, if not decapitated me, had Chloris not yelled "DUCK!".&nbsp;&nbsp; I survived with only a scratch on my palm, the one I used to shield my head and face from the tree.&nbsp; Mishap #2 complete.  &nbsp;  The next hour continued without incident.&nbsp; We passed a few people on innertubes,&nbsp; stopping at intervals to have a dunk in the water, or some snacks on a sandbar.&nbsp;&nbsp; It really was heaven being out there in nature, and as we continued downstream, I marveled at our good luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And then that luck ran out, quicker than lightning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or more precisely just exactly as quick as lightning, as a bolt of it, literally out of the blue, struck a tree directly in front of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the sky went black, the lightning and thunder intensified, and it was like we were being bombed by God himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Boo started freaking, like the sterotypical "guy prone to panic" does in all the war movies, at the first sign of combat: "We're gonna die, we're gonna die!" screaming hysterically and crying.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have to admit, I feared for our lives, as we were soaked to the bone and there was no safe shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did the best I could under the circumstances.&nbsp; I hit the closest riverbank and we took shelter about 10 feet up on it.&nbsp; It was a steep, and now very muddy bank, and Chloris and I took turns sheltering Boo with our bodies and the one towel we had with us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We kept slipping down.  &nbsp;  The lightning was incessant, and unnervingly close.&nbsp; Several times I didn't even get to count to 3 following a flash.&nbsp; Boo was still screaming and crying "I want to go home, RIGHT NOW!&nbsp; I told you guys this was a REALLY REALLY BAD IDEA!".&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  20 minutes into the storm, and still no let up.&nbsp; Hail the size of grapes was pelting us, and we started to get really cold.&nbsp; It was bitter irony.&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle of summer in lower Alabama, and we were freezing our asses off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially Boo.&nbsp; He'd stopped freaking out quite so much, and actually became calm, even yawning several times.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  He kept asking me "Dad, why did God make the lightning?&nbsp; Why would He do this?"&nbsp; I dodged the question and told him just to say a little prayer that we'd be safe, and I promised him that we would.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I also silently promised God that I'd never look at nude pictures of Michelle Marsh on the internet again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was the real reason God sent the storm that nearly sent me to Hades&nbsp;via the River Styx.&nbsp; But how do you explain that to your six year old?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, not long after that two "good old boy" types on jetskis found us huddled up on the bank, and volunteered to take us to safe shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp; We eagerly agreed, even though we'd watched "Deliverance" enough times to know better.&nbsp;&nbsp; After being stuck in that storm for what seemed an eternity, any alternative was better than being where we were.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And then, just as suddenly as the storm had come, it was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The two "good old boys" helped us empty the canoe of rainwater, and we got back in it.&nbsp;  We thanked them for their help, and told them we'd be all right on our own now.&nbsp;  No "squeal like a pig boy" afternoon was in store for us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was nice.  &nbsp;  We made it back to the landing about 2 hours after that, just ahead of the 7 p.m. deadline,&nbsp;  all three of us tired, shaken, but closer as a family and all of us loving life that much more.&nbsp;  It pretty much kicked Disney's jungle boat cruise square in the ass. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Tomorrow, it's been decided, we're going canoeing down the Styx River in Alabama.  I love Alabama because of it's people.  Forrest Gump would describe them much as he did his mama's take on life.  It's like a bunch of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.  Some are redneck type good ol' boys, some are Petey Pablo type southern wannabe pseudo-thugs, and then somewhere in between the margins are the regular folks.  As Boo and Chloris tucked into their slumber, I stayed up and watched my hometown MLS team, the Los Angeles Galaxy, play at Colorado vs. the Rapids.  It was awful soccer.  I'm somewhat of a soccer snob for someone who never could play the game well, having lived for a couple of years in Spain, and cut my football wisdom teeth in England as a Derby County fan.   I'm also a proud American, and we're the #7 team in the world according to the latest FIFA rankings.    Which is why it hurts me to say this: The Galaxy, one of the top two teams in MLS, played like shit tonight.  If it wasn't for the outstanding play of goal keeper Kevin "El Gato" Hartman, they'd have lost 3-0.  As it turned out, it was a 0-0 draw, which is why most Americans who haven't caught the soccer bug could give a shit.  But I love it.

      It's Wednesday, and it's 10 in the morning, and I'm not at work.  Which is nice.  The first day off, I did worry about my suboordinate co-worker, and his ability to cope with things, but as it turns out, I'm not as indispensable as I'd like to believe, and my workplace didn't fall into a hole in the ground due to my protracted absence from it.   Now I'm not thinking about work at all, and I'm really basking in the luxury of having to do fuck all, not even the lawns (it's been raining again, so fuck it).    Chloris is applying the old "let's get the floor done" pressure on me, so that's probably what will happen.  We've laid down most of the "tongue in groove" (not nearly as exciting as it sounds, believe me) wood in the living room, and haven't had to make a single cut yet.  I think today is the day we'll measure and cut and fit the rest of it.   I'm not a DIY guy at all, so this is extremely challenging.  And sometimes frustrating, but ultimately rewarding.  Kind of like life with Chloris.

      It's blazing outside, again.  86F and it's not even 10 a.m. yet.  I suppose that's a good thing, since I'm off work for a week.  I told Chloris I'd go out and mow the lawns, and since I'm not doing my workout today, it'll probably do me some good.    Later on we're going to take Pez and her family (less Madre and Uncle Mike, who left for Oklahoma early yesterday morning) to the beach at Lake Frederick.  It's a lot more tranquil than Pensacola Beach during a Blue Angels show, and they'll enjoy it.    If we leave sooner rather than later, I might even skate out of lawn mowing duty.

      He sometimes does that, and it's contagious.  He's got a fantastic sense of humo(u)r, that kid.  I bought him a bike this morning for his birthday, which is tomorrow.  It's a really cool chopper that I'm sure he'll love.  That, coupled with the fact that Livvy just got a bike will make it even better, since they can go riding together.  I can't wait to see the look on his face when he gets it.

      Wow, what a day!  Started out with a trip to Wal-Mart for munchies and beachside gear.  It was already 90F at 8 in the morning, so I knew the sands of Pensacola Beach would be an inferno.  I also wanted to leave extra-early, as the traffic going over the two bridges from Pensacola to the beach on Santa Rosa Island goes into full gridlock for these airshows.    We are all a bit sunburned, and the visitors from Oklahoma and England, respectively, made it through the day without suffering full-on heat stroke (although they were definitely suffering from heat stress).  Even our pal Pez was suffering, and she's been acclimated to this weather for a year!  Mind, she's not the outdoorsy type, and she was jonesing for a cold beer, so that didn't help much.  Her brother Sone and sister Munj were with us, as were her ex-Mother-in-Law Madre, and her brother, whom we all call Uncle Mike.    Sone is a very likeable chap, with Elvis Costello glasses and a fine resonant voice.  Munj is a lively thing, very animated and curious about the world.  She's going back to the UK, then to Ireland for a wedding, and then off to Fiji after that.    I'm an olive-skinned type that tans well, with only a bit of sunblock on for the day.  As Pez, Sone and Munj are half Indian (as in the country, India) and half Irish, they're a bit darker than chalk as well, so I didn't figure they'd have a problem with the heat.  In fact, Sone was telling us the other night about his trip to India that he enjoyed very much, and about how hot it was.    He really suffered yesterday though.  He was stuck under an umbrella sweating and chugging ice water while using our personal cold water/fan misting thing for most of the day.    Uncle Mike suffered as well, but he's a proud Cherokee, who delights in eating the hottest peppers known to man without reaching for a glass of water.  He didn't complain and said he very much enjoyed the show.    Madre didn't come dressed for the beach, and in retrospect, somebody really should have put a pair of shorts on her.  She wore Levi's into the furnace, and we had to take her to shade so she'd cool down.  She did recover though.    Munj did pretty well, taking full advantage (as did Chloris, Boo and myself) of the two fire hoses spraying fine mist into the air near the parking lot.  Every 15 to 20 minutes we got up and doused ourselves, and it kept us sane, if not cool.   Livvy, Pez's daughter and Boo's best friend, did well also, but only after waking up.  She hadn't got much sleep the night before, and was still feeling the effects of the drive from Oklahoma, where she was visiting her Dad.  She ended up very tanned and very tired.  Boo had a blast, and was right at home at the beach.  Born in Southern California, having spent his first year growing up in the Caribbean and now here in Florida, he's always been a beach boy.  Even looks the part with his blue eyes, blond hair and sun tan.  He did get a bit fussy on the drive home though, as we made the fatal mistake of not feeding him before we left, and he was ravenous.    Chloris had a blast too, and we wound the evening down having a few Coronas on the porch, reminiscing about the days events, and listening to Alternative Classics on the sattelite radio.   A very good day indeed.

      I did calisthenics and a 3 mile run this morning at 6 a.m., and now I'm dining on left over ribs, a chicken breast, and a spoonful of baked beans.  All courtesy of the 4th of July barbeque leftovers.  Really I just came back to shower and change, then it's off to work until midnight.  It's not so bad really, I am going to take a long lunch and go to the beach with my family.  It will help break the day up a little bit and hopefully stop the fatigue before it starts.

       urlLink    The water was especially clear today, Chloris and Boo were in ankle deep water looking this way, when all of a sudden a pod of dolphins appeared from the right, chasing some jacks.  Chloris said one dolphin leapt out of the water, slapped his tail on the prey-fish, and went back to eat the ones he'd stunned.  Who needs Discovery Channel?   Of course she was too excited to take pictures, as dolphins are her favo(u)rite animal.

      By the time we got out of the house today, the weather changed it's mind.  It was pissing down when we left, but we were resolute in our desire to just get out of the house for a while.  Even if it meant just getting lunch from McDonalds.    As it turned out, the sun came back, just as my darling wife predicted it would, and we had 3 quality hours of beach time, and a few good dips in the gulf (masks and snorkels optional).    I swam out to the spot where I saw the barracuda last week, but he'd decided not to show his toothy grille to us today.  We did see some evidence of predatory fish though, as several schools of baitfish jumping like popcorn kernels passed us by in the current.  Well worth the trip in my estimate, and nobody got (too) sunburned.

      I really was about to get off my arse and get my family up, but then I started browsing through all the different blogs and got a bit caught up in it.  My favorite one so far  is  urlLink The Insipid Filth of L.A.'s Least Hispanic Suburbanite.    This dude had me doubling over with laughter, and it also quelled a bit of Southern California homesickness in me, as I've not been to my homeland in quite some time.   Chloris really did look stunning this morning, even with "Post 4th of July morning after hair".  I think it was the fact that she's got a lime green bra on which accentuates two of her finer features.   The tone of this post has gone a bit south. I think it's time for me to get outside with the family.  For real, braddah.

      Now satisfied with the creation of my blog, I'm going to take my leave of this contraption, wake my wife and child and go enjoy some of the sunshine that has done it's best to elude us in recent weeks.  In case you haven't been glued to the weather forecast for northwest Florida, it's been very rainy of late.  Not exactly prime picnic weather.

      On reflecting, I see many parallels between mythology and modern organized religion, but I'm not an atheist, and I recognize the value of individual spirituality.  It's the inherent corruption of evangelical authority (absolute power corrupts absolutely, right?) that I take issue with.

      So this is it, my first blog, my first post.   It's the day after the 4th of July, which makes it the 5th of July. Nothing exceptional to report, feeling the effects of two rather strong cups of coffee while Chloris and Boo are slumbering away in the bedroom.  Boo has been staying up late playing his Game Cube, and Chloris stayed up late at the neighbor's barbeque last night.    The bin men are here.  That's "trash men" to most Americans, but then, unlike most Americans I know, I'm married to a Brit.  This means linguistic cross-pollenation is the norm in our household.    Thank God for air-conditioning.  The heat and humidity in this part of the country are absolutely stifling in summertime.    That's my first post done.  Scintillating reading I'm sure, but hey it's only my first attempt.  Read on if you will, otherwise I'm sure you'll find something else to amuse you.  I'm normally resourceful about entertaining myself, and I expect the same from other people.
