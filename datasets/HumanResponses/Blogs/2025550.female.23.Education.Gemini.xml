      Just a quick rant for the day---it is about a classmate.  In the class we have to do assignments on how we would arrange our classroom, what our classroom rules would be, etc.  Anyway she constantly models whatever she does after how her teachers or high school did things.  Then she talks about it like it was the best thing in the world.....I am sorry I didn't think we were in the program so we could repeat all the same mistakes the Arkansas school system has been making for years.  The state is near the bottom of national rankings as far as education goes--doesn't that mean we need to be making changes?  Accepting reform? Argh.....

      Classes are over for today.  My first class was Science Methods where we are taught effective ways of relaying science concepts to students.  Since taking this class I have really had to analyze the nature of science, I will even have to write a research paper on the topic. I have realized that many students are only exposed to science facts and cookbook lab exercises, and don't get a chance to really experience the inquiry side of science. I hope that in my first year of teaching I will be able to expose my students to science as scientists see it, as a changing process built upon a body of facts.  I would ideally like to have my students do a year long science project as a class.  The class would research a "problem" and decide on a topic together.  They would then formulate hypothesis and develop experiments to test them.  Doing this would really give them ownership, and along the way the frameworks and benchmarks will be met (you always have to consider the standards of the state and national benchmarks in all you do) . I think a lot of teachers don't take this approach, because it means a lot of work for them--but I am up for the challenge.  I just hope that my students don't choose something which requires me to tromp through the mud--because if you know me you know I hate dirt.         The other class I had today was Literacy Development.  We learn about ways to effectively use literature and help students to read in secondary grades.  Right now we are talking about effective ways to use textbooks in the classroom.  Many teachers don't use them appropriately, often allowing the book to dictate what is discussed in class ("Class today we are chapter 1, tomorrow we are on chapter two", etc...).  I personally hate textbooks, and I plan on using which ever one I am given as a source material. It will not be the basis for everything I teach. I learned today that when the "TOP 10" science textbooks were evaluated by scientists they were found to be unsatisfactory in both explaining key concepts and promoting higher order thinking from students.  Most textbooks are also written at a reading level far above the grade they are intended for.  With such a poor tool given to teachers, it is no wonder that they are not used effectively.  I think that  academic journal articles and trade books will be more the route I take to implement literature within my classroom.  This class has been really positive, as it has gotten me to read and enjoy reading much more lately. I think that I will have to be a model reader in my class in order to prompt my students to read--this class has helped me take a step in that direction.

      I went to Wal-Mart this evening--and got all giddy.  They had boxes if Crayola Colored Pencils on clearance for 1 dollar.  The BIG boxes.  Anyway so I bought 4 boxes, for teaching purposes of course.  I love school supplies.  I know this is silly--but I really love buying them.  There is just something about getting a fresh notebook at the beginning of a school year.  I know I am not the only person who feels like this because my friend Todd and I have shared our penchant for new supplies with each other before.  I think that is a side benefit of me becoming a teacher--I will always be buying school supplies. Then again I will probably always be "loosing" them to the little gnomes in my class.

      This is my final year of school, and when I think about it last year of my currently life. Next year I will be teaching in some exotic local (fingers crossed), and this year I am preparing for that adventure.  And when I say preparing, I mean preparing.  Having finished all my biology classes, and this semester and the next are dedicated to my education classes and student teaching.  I have had a few education classes over the past few years, but now they are all I have on my plate.   Over the summer I thought this semester was going to be cake compared to my previous semesters of intensive science study.  I can only say that I was wrong.  While education concepts are by no means challenging to understand they are thought provoking.  I find myself questioning how I want to teach students--ideas I once thought would be great to implement in my classroom are now just dust in the wind.  I have become a "reflective decision maker" as my program so desired/required of me.  For instance this morning I was planning my first lesson to teach in the high school.  I spent several hours planning 50 minutes worth of teaching material.  My original plan had been developed in my head within 5 minutes days ago, but today I kept analyzing it.  By the time I was done writing my lesson plan the whole plan had changed. While the original idea wasn't bad, it didn't take into account the classroom profile, science frameworks, and all the other considerations that teaching a lesson must take into account.  Teaching is far more than relaying knowledge to students.  Teaching, as I have discovered is counseling, tutoring, disciplining, cultivating, and a myriad of other tasks.    So teaching isn't cake like I once thought it was...I wonder what I am going to think of it on May 1st when it comes time for me to graduate.  I can't think about that now though--because Thursday is on my mind, the first day I get up in front of the class--the day I teach them what osmosis is and how it relates to jellyfish.  Thursday is a big day--and while it is one of the last days of my currently life--it is in a way the first day of my new one.  The first big day of my journey.

       urlLink How Urban Schools Keep Good Teachers at Bay (washingtonpost.com)   Yesterday I wrote about how keen it would be to work in DC schools.  It seems that if I want to do so I will have to put in a bit of work, and not get frustrated. In the  urlLink New Teachers Project study    it was found that up to 69 percent of applicants to inner-city schools (who were more highly qualified than applicants to suburban schools) withdrew their applications out of frustration with the system.  And schools act like they are hard up for teachers when they turn away so many---very interesting.  Any one looking to working in an Urban district should take a look at the study.

      Seems that DC is trying to get people to move back from the suburbs of Virginia and Maryland (read it in the post this morning, but couldn't find the link this evening).  They apparently want to increase the city population by 100,000 people.  I can only imagine this means more education jobs (not as if there is a shortage or anything).  Although my parents are not keen on the idea,  I think I would really like to live and work in the district.  I suppose I am an adult at this point--and it will be my choice----only one problem aside from that-----it is freakn expensive to live in the city!  Oh, but how I would love to live in a nice little row house--to bad I would need about 5 roomies to survive financially.

      After seeing Miss Frizzles inspirational educational quote, I thought I would share one that has inspired me.  This is something I will definitely be placing at the top of any course outline/syllabus I use when I teach.    "To struggle and to understand.  Never the first without the last. That is the law." -George Mallory

      Am watching  urlLink Fat Like Me  on ABC tonight.  This is such an important issue for educators to be familiar with, as there are many emotional/social impacts on overweight children.  Whether we think about it daily or not, our job goes beyond soley teaching our subject,  but also includes aspects of mentoring and counseling.    After reading  urlLink Fast Food Nation  this summer I became irate at the lengths soda and fast food companies go to in order to infiltrate schools.  I understand that it can be very hard for a poor school district, or any school district for that matter, to pass up large sums of money in order for a company to be in the school; however schools are taking this money at a high price to it's students.  As a future teacher I will not allow my students to drink sodas or eat candy bars in my class.  This shouldn't be to hard as I will be a science teacher and food isn't traditionally allowed in the lab anyway, but I don't personally want to contribute to this epidemic.  As a science educator I think it will also be my job, when it comes to the human anatomy part of the curriculum, to relay the impact bad eating choices can make on the human body (I don't think this job should be left to health educators alone).  I'll again speak of the hidden curriculum of schools--I think that education on healthy eating choices, just like drug and alcohol abuse education, should be implemented.  Children that do not receive this support and education at home need to receive it somewhere, for their own sakes.

      I meant to share this earlier, but somehow it slipped my mind.  Thursday a deer got into the high school.  It apparently broke through some windows to get in---then appeared to chase a student down the hall (it probably wasn't really after the student, but looking for a way out).  It then escaped the school by breaking through another set of windows and made it's way downtown.  I might add that the high school isn't on the edge of the town or anything---this deer must have really been lost!  Also got to love that is was Spirit week and the deer broke in on Camo day.    Only in Arkansas....   urlLink TheCabin.net Â·Â· Oh, deer 10/24/03

          Taped my lesson today.  It went pretty well I think.  I haven't watched it yet, it is sitting here on my desk and I am resisting.  I know I should watch it before I give it to my peer for review, but still--I can't bare it.  I have resident assistant duty this weekend, which means I can't leave my dorm--I am kind of on "guard"--so Ill probably get bored and decided to watch it at some point--------

      Today was my day at the high school.  Since it is Homecoming Week today was retro day, I didn't even know it before I went--but I was dressed for the occasion.  I was looking very classic in my pencil skirt and Lavern style letter shirt.  One girl told me she really liked my shirt--and she asked if I had seen any B's at the store.  She then lamented that she had been looking up and down for a B.  I asked her what her last name was and she said Clark.  I told her she may have better luck finding a C.  She agreed , and I was flattered that this 15 year old was taking fashion advice from her "old" teacher.    Anyway so the kids were not as restless as I imagined they would be.  I always remembered homecoming week as being all fun, and not ever really getting down to business.  But they were good, and we were able to complete the whole lab this week.  They were doing the  urlLink classic meterstick/reactiontime lab .  It went pretty smoothly, aside from some students who failed to do 3 repetitions.  Observing this lab reminded me how important it is to give student's both written and oral instructions, because the oral instructions failed to reach all the students.   Some students did have a problem comprehending the idea of the measurement being the change in distance as the meter stick fell--but they eventually understood after either I or the teacher explained it.  I also really think the students should have done a pre-lab before hand----but that is what I have been saying this whole year and nothing seems to change yet.     Overall the lab was nice though, because we took the students outside and it is such a beautiful day (Sunny and low 80's).   Tomorrow I have my first video tape lesson--it is one of my volcano lessons and should go pretty smoothly.  Part of my lesson, as this lesson is for my literacy class, is to read them a book aloud.  So I have been practicing reading it aloud--I am sure anyone walking down the dorms hall thinks I am crazy----but better I practice then come out all choppy on the video.  I don't plan on watching my video before I give it to my peer editor as I hate my taped voice, and would rather not know before hand what embarrassing tidbits got caught on tape---but I do know I need to watch it eventually if I am going to improve as a teacher whatsoever.  It is just so damn weird watching yourself.

      It has been a long day.  Classes since 8 am.  I think I am going to settle in and read the  urlLink Demon in the Freezer  for the remainder of the night.  I am reading this for my literacy class, as we have to 4 four novels within out content area.  It is pretty interesting so far--do any of you science teachers use tradebooks currently in your classes?  If yes which ones?  And in what method do you use them?  Enough for now, as it is going to be another long day at the high school tomorrow.

      Watching 60 minutes right now.  Apparently there are some doctors who feel that dyslexia is caused by a malformation of the cerebellum.  For this they prescribe a set of exercises which are said to cure dyslexia (how isn't exactly explained).  It cost $3000 dollars to get these exercises.  60 minutes followed two patients doing these exercises.  One patient apparently felt it got worst but then better (he was an adult), and another felt she got better (she was a young adolescent)--apparently this is really popular in Britain right now.  Thought it was interesting and would be interested in learning more about this as I figure Ill have a few dyslexic students in my future.

      I found this article in the post and thought it was really interesting that character education, which is considered part of the hidden curriculum here in Arkansas, is actually part of the overt curriculum in Virginia.     urlLink At School, the Issue Is Character (washingtonpost.com)   Do any of you current teachers have mandates on character education?  I am not sure if one single day called Character Education day would be very productive, it seems like character education would have to be enforced a little bit everyday for it to really be productive.  And maybe since children receive character education at younger ages now, community service would be a better way for teenagers to learn civics (Maryland does this).

      Okay, I know I give Arkansas a lot of grief here, but today I actually have something good to say. I was at the airport this morning reading the Washinton Post (a real one, not the internet version I settle for every other day) I came across an article about which states have the highest teacher quality, meaning they are fully certified.  Arkansas was number 3 on the list--with 97% of teachers being highly qualified to do their jobs.  Arkansas was ranked just under Wisconsin and Idaho--so Ill give the state a way to go today.

      A funny incident happened with the cultural programs today in my mom's class.  Well they were running rather long, and since Monday is a half day at my mom's school she said that students who brought food as part of their presentation should present before the day was ended.  Well the all the kids that had brought food presented and then it was time for the kids to go to lunch (the have lunch before they leave for the day).  As the kids where lining up this one student came up to my mom and said he forgot to present as he showed her some California rolls he brought to share with the class.  As time was pressed, my mom asked if it would be possible for him to bring some more tomorrow.  He said that would be fine and that he would eat his presentation for lunch.  At the time I didn't think to much of this---just thought he was a forgetful kid.    Well my mom came home today and told me that his mom came in during the afternoon to fetch the boys math book (apparently he is very forgetful).  My mom explained the situation, to which the mother replied "I tried to convince him that California rolls were not part of Korean culture, but he really wanted to bring them.  Tonight we will work on a poster about Korean food".  Ha--the kid was not even Japanese--which was obvious if you looked at him--but I didn't even make the connection when he held out the California roll.  Apparently it was his intention all along to eat it for lunch---got to love sneaky kids.

      Today I went and visited my mother's 5th grade classroom, in Alexandria VA.  The faces were all so different from those that I see in Arkansas.  Today her class presented their cultural projects, in which they had to research their ancestry and share it with the others in the class.  Of all the presentations only one student billed themselves as only being an "American".  There were a number of students who defined themselves as being half this half that and half another thing (yes this does add up to one and a half---which kind of made it cute).  I know that if this project had been done in a classroom in much of Arkansas the projects would have been dominated with European culture, which would contrast greatly with the whole world being represented in my mothers room.  When they tell us at UCA that we should be doing group work in heterogeneous groups, it usually implies placing one minority student in with a group of white students.  But in my mother,s classroom groups would certainly be truly heterogeneous--which each student representing a distinctly different cultural group.  It was really great to see that is would be the type of multicultural environment that I would be teaching in next year.    I can't wait-because being around students with such varying world views will teach me so many things.  I see learning from my students being as important as me teaching them.  For instance today one girl presented on Korean culture, because she is half Korean (the cutest little girl)--she brought in her first birthday outfit and explained the importance of the first birthday in the Korean culture.  She told about how they place certain objects in front of the baby and which ever object the baby reaches for is an omen of sorts into the future of the child.  For example if the baby picks up the pencil she will be a teacher. It was so interesting and  I might have never learned about that tradition if I had not heard her presentation---

      I am on Fall Break now, back home in DC for the weekend.  But before I left I got the latest edition of the Arkansas Times, the free press.  Great paper.  Each year they have the " urlLink You know your an Arkie" contest .  This year many entries actually revolved around education as the colsolidation issue, as I have talked about before is big news. Here are just some of the educational bits--enjoy.  You're a Real Arkie if ….   You are against "school consolidation" but you can't spell either word.  - Clifton Coleman Jr., Hot Springs   You think being No. 1 in education means having the lowest superintendent-to-student ratio in the nation.  - Jim Pfeifer, Little Rock   You hire an educational consultant to help improve your schools, but reject his suggestions.  - Monitia Turner, Pine Bluff   You think 308 school superintendents for 75 counties is about right.   Bucky Jones, Rogers   And yes, Bucky is probably a legit name.  Anyway it provided some entertaining reading on the plane today. Have a great weekend everyone.

      You just have to love it when the good ole boys get caught in their naughty actions.       urlLink CNN.com - School says Muslim girl can return with scarf - Oct. 15, 2003   It is such a shame that 11 year old girls become the subject of attack for the good ole boys. The good ole boy system definitely dominates the school districts around here as well. Arkansas is in the bible belt and things are definitely influenced by that mindset.    Right now in Arkansas the big deal is school consolidation.  The Arkansas country side is dotted with small schools which don't have enough students, teachers, or funding to offer all the classes that should be offered for a student to receive an adequate education.  So the state government is trying to impose consolidation among the schools (which I personally think needs to happen)--but the small towns are resisting as the Friday night school football game is the towns epicenter and identity. Apparently consolidation is going to rip towns apart----and the good ole boys who played for the school team in 1972 definitely don't want to see that happen.  But what they don't realize is the risk this is putting their children in.  Arkansas will definitely remain at the bottom of the national listings for education if something is not changed now.

      We have been talking recently about the use of textbooks in today's classroom in my literacy class.   Today there was an article about it at CNN.com:   urlLink CNN.com - Some educators take issue with textbooks - Oct. 15, 2003   I would be interested in hearing from current secondary teachers as to how they use the textbook.  I see the importance of having a textbook for certain students who need to read things to understand---but I don't want to center my class around the book.  Should I assign readings?  Or should I just give it to them and let them read it if they need to? I suppose that even if I assign readings only those who probably don't need to read it will do so anyway....

      It amazes me how some people I am taking classes still need to be spoon fed.  Today I had my classroom management class and a case study paper was due.  All one would need, to know that it was due was a copy of the syllabus--it was right there in black and purple (you know ed teachers like to use the pretty paper).  So I get to class today and discover that I am one of 3 student out of about 25 that has actually completed it.  So she didn't mention it during the previous class period--I thought we were in our senior block of classes for goodness sake--and these people are going to be teachers?  If someone cannot a freakn read a syllabus--how can they expect to give one and have there students stick to it.  The prof was so mad that she just dismissed class, which I don't really blame her for.  It wouldn't be really possible to have a constructive case study discussion with only 3 participants.  I am just amazed.  So I spent part of the day working on my volcano unit and also my first day narrative which I have to write for my classroom management class.  The first day narrative is actually kind of a fun project.  First of all it is something that I will be able to use on my real first day of school.  I have to write a story of everything I would say, and then make an appendix of all the forms, papers, activities I would give to students that day.  I really had fun making the syllabus--also spent hours looking at cool  urlLink fonts    to make the papers look fun for the kids.   I also had some fun starting to develop my volcano unit.  I got some good ideas from the  urlLink USGS  site.  I am not ripping it of mind you--but it was a good starting place for me to brainstorm.      So far this is my outline for the unit:  Day 1  A power point presentation introducing the 3 types of volcanoes, how they form, and where most volcanoes are located.  Then give out word puzzles to the students to enforce the plethora of new vocabulary.  Day 2   A class activity (okay I did get this off the site) in which students will make the different types of volcanoes and investigate the different materials that make them.  Day 3   I will have students investigate the ring of fire by having them find the locations of the most recent volcanic eruptions from the internet--and then have them plot them on one big world map/bulletin board, opposed to individual worksheet maps.  I will have each student find 5 eruption sites--and if I had 25 students it would result in 125 site--hopefully making the 'ring of fire' evident.  Each site will be marked with a certain colored flag which will signify the type of volcano (cinder cone, stratovolcano, or shield) as well.  Hopefully this will teach them patterns of where certain types of volcanoes occur.  Day 4   I am using a intergrated literacy lesson this day.  I will begin the class reviewing the concepts of volcanoes.  Then I will introduce the book (Volcano: Ordeal By Fire in Iceland's Westmann Islands) and read an excerpt from it.  I will then give the students a prompt on which to free write placing themselves in a volcanic eruption.  This will give students a chance to practice writing as if there were writing for one of the many stanardized tests they have to take.   Day 5   assessment--I haven't figured out which type yet.    Okay--that outline was kind of for my own purposes, as I had yet to get it down on paper.  Any input would be accepted and appreciated.

      Another article on an  urlLink innovative teacher.  .  Wow--this is one dedicated man.  He puts in 12 hour days and doesn't take his vacations.  I am amazed.    We have learned the importance of reading aloud to students in my literacy class, he reads to his students for over an hour and a half each day, which is amazing.  Maybe there really is something to reading to students aloud if their test scores are as stellar as the article says.   Another interesting thing found in the article relates to the pedagogy of poverty, in which students are taught in such a way that the cycle of poverty they are stuck in never changes.  Esquith doesn't believe that learning should be fun, but rather it should be challenging--so that students will know how to deal with tough situations.  I never really thought if that before, but I think I like it.

      The Washington Post as started a series of occasional articles highlighting the philosophies and techniques of innovative teachers.   This is the only one I found so far, but thought it was interesting:   urlLink D.C. Teacher Lifts History Out of the Dustbin (washingtonpost.com)   "...that students are best able to learn the critical facts and concepts when they're active participants." While this article took place in a history classroom this is exactly what the science benchmarks are calling for--an authentic learning experience.  I would really like to do a long-term research project with my class next year.  Does anyone have any advice for me as far as this goes?   This part cracked me up: "She's so lively and interesting," said Charlotte Bush, 13. "She's bouncing around saying, 'I don't care about Ben and Jen, I love history,' and somehow, she gets you interested in things you don't think you are interested in. . . . I think that's kind of great."   I guess that part got to me because she was talking about something the students could relate to--she was using their lingo.  It reminded me of the other day in my observing class, I was helping out in lab.  Students were looking at a mixture of milk and iodine to see Brownian Motion under the microscope.  This one kid raised his hand and asked me "Is this what I am supposed to see?  It is so tight!"...I responded with "If it's tight it can't be wrong.  Tight is all that matters"....my mentor teacher later came up to me laughing saying that he heard what I said to the student and that he thought it was hilarious.  I wanted to respond to him by telling him that I wasn't just using the students lingo--but that it is mine as well--because I am not to much older than them--which reminded me I best watch what I say--I can't have my students identifying to much with me--or me with them.

      Today my Science Methods class was observed by an NCATE reviewer.  I tried to remain silent throughout--because I didn't want my views of the program to come out.    Enough about that---I have a case study to work on this evening, besides that I am pretty much going to be working on my integrated unit over volcanoes.  Funtimes.

      Another good artice from the post.  What do you think--should grades be based solely on academic work, or on behavior and participation as well?  Should an effort grade be separate? I think that the article is write when it says that teachers should be making work challanging enough for students so that they don't easily side by--but how do you do that with so many levels of students in one class?   urlLink How Do You Grade Behavior?

      Since I am going back to NOVA or DC to teach next year I like to read the educational news in the Washington Post to keep tabs on what is going on.  Here are a article that I found interesting this evening:   urlLink New Order in the Court (washingtonpost.com)   Finally geeks rule--I can't wait to get back to a place where diversity really rules.  This school really has a culture that fosters respect, change and progress.  If the schools culture encourages change in who they vote for the homecoming court--just imagine how must they embrace change and new ideas in other areas.

      My education program is currently going through the process of having its national accreditation renewed.   urlLink NCATE  is the organization who does the review, and they sent 6 delegates to look at my university.  Today there was a session held in which each department had an exhibition board and representatives (students, profs, and former students who are now teaching).  So I was asked to represent the science department as a student today, and I obliged.  We had a meeting earlier in the week to inform us as to what types of questions would be asked--and as to how we should answer--positively of course.    So I was asked what I thought of the format of our second internship---was it positive that we were in one school for the whole semester?  The following was my answer: "I can see both positives and negatives to the format.  For instance, we are only given one experience, rather than a variety, which going to more than one school could fulfill.  Overall though the format is positive because it allows us to stick with one class and one mentor teacher for an extended period of time, which is a more authentic experience."  I thought my answer was fine, as it gave more depth than "I think the format is just wonderful, nothing could be wrong or improved with it". But for some reason I don't think the head of my department was pleased.  I am sorry but I am not a drone programmed to love and see no flaw in my program.  Wouldn't it be a little weird to hear no critic as a reviewer?  The program is stressing us to become "Educators as reflective decision makers"--well I have reflected a bit on the format of the internship and I gave my honest view. Overall I think the format is good--but with all things there is always a drawback.  Anyway I know my one answer won't detriment the whole accreditation process---but it sure seemed like it at the time.  You can bet I remain quiet for the duration.

          My inner child is six years old!    Look what I can do!  I can walk, I can run, I can read! I like to do stuff, and there's a whole big world out there to do it in.  Just so long as I can take my blankie and my Mommy and my three best friends with me, of course.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I think that having an inner child is very important when you teach.  Children usually don't take life to seriously--and I think that is an important quality to have at times when you are in the stressful environment of the school.  I think that having my inner child be six years old is a pretty good thing.  Most six year olds are at the cusp of really starting to learn, which in a way I am doing at this point in time in regards to education.  Six year olds also mostly make it to the bathroom themselves--which I find very important...hehe.  How old is your inner child?

      Woke up bright and early on this fine Saturday morning to go pick up litter.  As part of my program, specifically for one of my classes, we had to develop a community service project which emphasizes our content area, then we had to implement it.  So my classmates and I helped out on the school clean-up.  It was the morning after a football game, so there was plenty to clean up along the streets by the school.  Since the kids were getting extra credit for their AP Bio class about 50 showed up.  We had nifty orange vest and trash bags for the kids to use--it was a great success.    The event also provided me with an opportunity to really interact with students.  We split the kids up into groups of about 5 and send them to different locations around the school grounds to clean up.  So my classmates and I split up and went with different groups.  I forgot how much of a brownnoser I must have been in high school until this one gal in my group was trying to be the teachers clone.  She was way hyper--singing a song the whole way.  While it was a bit endearing--it was annoying all the same.  After the school cleanup the boys had a great idea--they thought it would be hilarious to see how many kids they could fit into one of the guys vintage beetles.  And it really was funny watching them---until the wheels were bending inward and the car was about to bottom out----I almost had a heart attack.  I could just imagine the parents coming to us being like "you allowed them to do that"....Anyway we promptly got the kids out of the car....And it survived---so did we.    It is weird--because these kids are trying to pull the most hilarious stunts--it makes me want to laugh---but I have to enforce order--just like my RA job----my residents are crazy, and I want to play right along with them--but I can't--or that means trouble...

My goodness--even if special ed students do eventually do janitorial work---shouldn't we be teaching them more than job skills?  Don't we teach every other student more than job skills?  These are not proper modifications by any means!  I can't freakn believe these people...

      Mid-terms are over, so I can refocus on the set of lesson plans that I need to create.  I have decided to do my science curriculum unit on volcanoes, because earth science actually has alot of good resources--and I think it will be fun.  This is going to keep me busy for a while!  I am going to plan it for a 7th grade class, which I think will be a good experience for me, because everything up till now has been for high school students, and I think I should vary my experience a bit. I am going to be certified 7-12 afterall, and I never know--a junior high school just might hire me.  Plus, it seems like you can get a better response to some of the cheesy activities from 7th graders, then from high schoolers.  Not that I actually have to teach this unit, I just thinkI can be a bit more playful with it for the younger set.    I went to my high school class yesterday, and when I arrived the period that had been so horrible to me the week before told me that they really enjoyed my lesson and that it has really helped them in what they are doing now.  Specifically one student said that every time my mentor teacher refers to diffusion now she thinks about when I showed it visually with the kool-aid--and she said that helped her alot.  So that made me feel good for the rest of the day--responses like that are the reason I want to be a teacher.  So I guess they kind of revived me--and they didn't even know it.    So the weekend will be spent doing lesson plans and case studies. I have fall break next weekend, so I want to get some loose ends tied up so I can enjoy that time.  Oh yeah the next time I actually have to teach isn't until Nov 6--and I will be teaching a lab.  I have talked it over with my mentor teacher, and I am going to do a lab on DNA modeling--should be pretty fun--I love playing with lego like things....

I read an article a while back about a teaher who used PDA's everyday in his class.  Students were beamed notes, quizzes, and feedback from him.  I thought it was really great--because it also teaches students how to effectively use the technology that is going to shape the future of our buisness world and everyday life.  Cells phones--well that is another story all together....

      So today in my literacy class we started to brainstorm what we were going to do our micro-teach about.  It of course has to be a lesson in which we involve literacy in some way.  So I am totally in love with this vintage book my grandma has (she owns a library practically) about Iceland and it's volcanoes.  It has wonderful photographs and such--so that is what I am going to base my lesson around.  I just love having wonderful resources at my disposal--another assignment complete.  Now I just have to video tape myself teaching it---yuck. I am not so excited about that.

      I went to the movies with a friend today, and throughout the movie I kept being reminded of educational theory.   urlLink School of Rock   was hilarious--Jack Black totally cracks me UP.  Anyway the premise of the movie is that a slacker musician needs a job and he becomes a long term substitute teacher.  So he has no clue and no desire initially to do anything with his students--then he discovers their musical talents and hones them.  The whole way he taught his students reminded me of a truly integrated curriculum.  The class had a project in which they were forming a band--some students were in the band, others did the behind the scenes stuff--anyway they were all really learning throughout the "project" even when they were not being taught directly.  At one point in the movie the principal came to observe his class and afterward told him that "we don't look highly on alternative methods of teaching"---this reminded me how "the man" really regulates, or tries to regulate what we do as teachers.  Okay--well enough of my movie analysis...I highly recommend the movie for a good laugh--

       urlLink Lake View , Lake View, Lake View.  That the big thing in the news these days dealing with education.  Anyway I won't ponder on it long, but you should check it out.    Looking back on yesterdays lesson today I am a bit more calm.  My advisor said that he felt my lesson went well--as well as my fellow students lesson---but we are not totally convinced.  We both decided that we expected to do better, and that we didn't feel as comfortable as we thought we would.  We are hoping for a better experience in November when we teach a lab.   Once you take time to look back on things you can also find some humor in them.  For instance there was this kid who asked me if I was nervous when I was helping them with the group activity.  I snapped back "No", when really I wanted to cry.  After I said no he said that I seemed nervous, but that I was doing a good job.  I find it funny that I was trying to put on a big front of being cool, calm and collected--and this kid saw right through it.  I really am an open book sometimes.      Oh yeah--so after teaching my lesson yesterday we had a big meeting about student teaching in the spring.  We received all  the paper work to fill out--it is making the end feel so real now.  I have to go to the police station sometime soon and get fingerprinted for my FBI background check, which should be an interesting experience.  I also have to write a personal narrative which will be given to the mentor teacher and principal I will be working with during the next semester--this is so they can get to know a bit about me and my education background.  I wonder if they ever get these things, read them, then decide they don't want that person in their school.  I suppose I should really make it good.  Student teaching and Little Rock here I come.

      It is over, my first day of teaching a lesson.  And oh--during the first period I just wanted to cry.  In my first lesson I planned a group activity with 27 students--what was I thinking?  I walked around the room monitoring the groups, but non of them were staying on task.  It was really aggravating.  I also don't feel I lectured enough in the beginning, and what I did lecture about felt disconnected and choppy.  I know that teaching is something you have to practice at, an art you have to perfect--but in the mean time I am just displeased with my performance.  The second period was a bit better, yet still not all I had hoped for.  This class was much smaller, 17, and they actually stayed on task and completed the group activity in about half the time the first period did.  Luckily this was the period I was observed in, because had it been the first--I might have really cried.  Anyway-this experience has made me realized and enforced a few things.  1) I want to teach. 2) I need to practice teaching. 3) Group activities are not for the novice. 4)  I am really glad I didn't get an alternative certification, because without all this education I would be lost.  5) Teaching makes you really tired.    I know there should be a deeper analysis of this experience, but I am to tired for that tonight--so maybe tomorrow.

      Since coming back from Europe I have been fairly interested in environmental issues, especially those concerning food---such as organic and genetically modified foods.   So continuing my quest for new knowledge concerning environmental issues I attended a lecture today by  urlLink Terry Collins , from Carnegie Mellon University.  He was plugged as the leading expert on Green Chemistry--and his talk was really interesting.  I really like it when you can walk away from a lecture and have learned something that you can apply to any facet of your life.    At the end of his talk about Sustainability, he used ideas from Stephen Covey to put the importance of sustainability into perspective.  I am sure Stephen Covey's purpose was life application, which is what I took away from the lecture.    We usually live much of our lives in the waste category, playing on the internet or watching TV. We spend hours doing these things--an they are not important, not at all.  And when we are doing something non-wasteful we are often doing what others want us to, things in the Not Important, Urgent category.  Things in this category are for short-term fulfillment--and don't have the long haul in mind. This is when you have to question yourself--is what you are doing in life important for the duration, for the long haul?   Am I making a positive impact for future generations, or in essence am I killing them (in the case of sustainability)?    You can also question the authenticity of your relationships--are the people you really care about in the important category?  Do you make them a priority, an urgency? Or are they in the non-urgent category-- possibly meaning that you want them to stay around and that maybe it will take a while for the relationship to be truly defined, or authenticated.    Aside from the personal implications, this can also be applied to teaching.  Are we filling students with non-important facts that we either use to fill time or teach because society dictates it---or are we teaching students important concepts which are necessary and will give them an authentic life experience?  Are we teaching students to look towards the future, not meaning college or career, but towards future generations of people who we have a direct impact on?  Are we teaching students for life, or for the moment?    I think Ill have to sleep on this one.

So it is quiet and lonely on campus tonight----but tomorrow Ill be nice an cozy at home with the family.

Anyway that was my last assignment for the semester--so now I can just kick back and get all of my things ready to move.  In case I haven't mentioned it I am moving to Little Rock from Conway (about 25 miles) for my student teaching in the spring.  It will be my first semester off campus, and should serve as a nice transition between campus life and what will come in the fall--really living on my own.  Anyway since I am on RA duty this weekend I am stuck in the building---that is okay so because it is real rainy out.  So I think Ill spend the rest of the day watching classic movies ( urlLink TCM  is my new fav) and reading  urlLink Food Politics .  I hope everyone else is enjoying their weekend.

      I had my micro-teach video tape lesson yesterday.  I have no idea why, but I got so nervous.  I had no problem the last time I taught the students, but teaching a lesson in front of my peers is something different.  When I get nervous I talk a bit fast----okay a lot fast.  Anyway aside from the speed it was great.  Five of us taught out  mini-lessons yesterday, I was the last to go.  Like I mentioned in a previous post my lesson centered around a blogging activity.  No one in my class was familiar with blogging---so after my lesson I was berated with questions about it.  My prof was really into it--even mentioned how great she thought it would be to do a blog with her own classes.  Anyway I was happy about that--because I actually did teach them something--so they were not just sitting their bored.

      We had team time again in my curriculum class for planning our curriculum unit.  Usually I am a bit weary about group projects--one because I like control--and two because I dread slackers (I know, I know what a weird combination if you really think about it).  Anyway my group is great, and we have developed a great interdisciplinary unit on Oceans----sometimes this education stuff makes me so giddy.  But this education stuff also makes me a bit tense--I have another video tape lesson to do tomorrow.  I have to "give an assignment" simple as that---and since it is a lesson I used for another class it shouldn't be hard at all.  Interestingly enough the assignment I am giving is a blogging assignment---entries for a class blog logging science related events.

      Today in my classroom management class we discussed managing "bad" behaviors in the classroom.  I have come to realize that I think I am going to be a pretty laid back teacher in some respects. I am not sure if this is a good thing---I am going to have to find a middle ground between being a hard a** and a push-over.  The behaviors that are going to bother me the most, and become the bane of my existence as a teacher are tardiness and cheating.  I think anything else I can pretty much let roll off my back and not get upset over.  I really picture my heart breaking the first time I catch someone cheating---and I know it is going to most likely be an inevitable event.    Also I thought about something today that scares me--- my reaction to students talking back to me, or even going as far as calling me a b***** or whatnot----I really fear I might cry if that happened.  If it was to happen to me social settings I am liable to just retort with similar comments, but of course as a professional and a authority this can not be the case.  Also---compared to many of my students I am small---only 5'4'' I don't have much physical presence to throw around among the 6 ft, 250 pound football player type.  I am really going to have to have an air of confidence about myself that first day--------here I am months away from graduation and I am already thinking about my first day in "my classroom". I already have friends telling my that my students are going to give me such a hard time because I look so young, I think their comments are really building a fear in me.      I am not concerned with being the "cool" teacher at all, but I at least hope my teaching is liked-------I know this ends on an incomplete thought----but I have so much to do......

      My science methods professor went to the regional NSTA conference this past weekend.  He brought back a ton of fun stuff to share.  One of the items was this radioactive salt--which, when heated in the dark glows like fiber optics---very cool.  Would be great to use when teaching radiation.  The salt is brown in color initially, then turns white after exposed to the heat------------I tried to find something online like it, but couldn't.  Ill have to ask him for the source tomorrow.

      I know I shouldn't be so critical and write about my classmates here, but last week it came to a breaking point in my Literacy class with this one girl.  I think I mentioned her before, the girl who no matter what we are discussing has to interject "well at my high school we would.....".  (as a side note I recently found out that her end all be all great high school doesn't even have a foreign language teacher, students have to take by correspondence (which is just another reason why Arkansas schools need to be consolidated, but that aside))----anyway so in class we were discussing how pointless it is to have students look up definitions of words and have them copy them several times just to learn the meaning of the word.  Well this Girl goes off about how that is what they did at her school and she learned words just fine---the professor tried to reason with her and tell her why it was pointless------but she just kept protesting his efforts.  So finally I interject and tell her that having students do work like that is just busy work and that if she wants to be a lazy teacher and sit behind her desk she can go right ahead and do so-----but what you should really have students do is use those words in an *authentic* situation blah blah blah........She finally shut up for the rest of the class period--and was actually almost in tears----that was at the beginning of last week and we haven't heard about her "wonderful" school since.  Am I a bully now?

      So many things to do this week, so little time.  I have about 10 formal lesson plans to write for the integrated curriculum unit I am doing for a class (of course I didn't utilize my weekend at all).  I don't know what teachers have to do in the "real world" as far as lesson plans go, but the following is what we have to fill out pertaining to each lesson:  LEARNING GOALS/OBJECTIVES What are your goals for student learning for this lesson? That is, what do you intend students to learn? Why have you chosen these goals, and how do they connect to past and future learning? (Consider referring to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks in giving your rationale.)  STUDENT GROUPING How will you group students for instruction? Why have you chosen this grouping?  METHODS What teaching method(s) will you use for this lesson? Why have you chosen this/these method(s)?  ACTIVITIES What activities have you planned and how much time has been allocated to each?  MATERIALS What instructional materials will you use, if any? Why have you chosen these materials?  EVALUATION How and when do you plan to evaluate student learning on the content of this lesson? Why have you chosen this approach to evaluation?  I know these are so detailed so that we get acclimated to thinking about each aspect when we get into the "real world"--but they get a bit tiring sometimes.  In addition I really need to start the next phase of my "nature of science" paper--the writing phase.  I have done most of the research, and have found some really good sources---research papers in addition to the usual educational commentary found in education journals.  I need to get this done before Thanksgiving, so that I can catch up with friends while I am home.   I can hardly believe I am winding down to my last 4 weeks of class, before I am done with undergrad classes forever-------student teaching next semester is going to be some good "real world" experience.  One thing that will be weird to get back in the swing of is waking up early every morning and being in school "ALL DAY"-----I suppose I should try and get through this week first before I think about that.

      I was really tired today--and not feeling so hot about observing this afternoon.  When I arrived at school however the afternoon classes were all taking a test---I decided to bow out----because once you have seen one test administered--you have seen them all pretty much.  Anyway so I had a day off--and now I have a 3 day weekend ahead of me, because tomorrows classes are cancelled---hooray for me and being a slacker.

      In my curriculum class we are working on an integrated curriculum unit.  It is actually a lot of fun.  Because of scheduling conflicts our class profile isn't very diverse, just the English and science secondary major students.  So we are not making a traditional integrated lesson with English, science, math, and social studies; but rather I am in a group with one English person, a earth science person, and me covering life science.  We choose the Ocean as our theme and have developed essential questions around it.  So far we have planned out our two weeks worth of lessons and this week are working individually on our lesson plans.    I do have to add that making an effective integrated unit takes a lot of cooperation and time.  I can see how it would be very difficult to be on a team if you didn't have common planning periods.  It isn't that hard for us to develop a unit, but we are given almost 10 hours of class time to get together and work. I couldn't imagine getting a unit together if you had to commit your own time to it.    Is anyone out there in a teaming situation?  How does it work out for you?

      So the big project this semester in my Science Methods class is to write a research paper on the nature of science and how to teach it to secondary students.   I was doing some more research this weekend and came upon a journal article about how it is hard to teach the nature of science, because teachers are not clearly told what the nature of science is-------so I am sitting here now questioning the paper I have to write---is it just one big trick question?  Well of course not, but that particular article was just a bit concerning when I came across it.  It made me laugh---I suppose that writing this paper is suppose to help me not be the teacher described in the article.

      I taught the second and last of my observed lessons for the semester today.  This lesson was a lab, and in conjunction with my mentor teacher we decided I would teach a DNA modeling lab.  It went really well--I felt really good about it after it was over.    I do have one thing to say though--teaching a lab is exhausting.  I thought I gave clear directions, but students still asked questions through the whole class. I was all over the room throughout the period, helping one student or another.  The outcome was really good though--the models looked great.  The kids also seemed to get something out of it, and they were having fun.  If all they got out of it was that the structure of DNA is a double helix, and that the nitrogenous bases pair A-T and G-C I will be happy.  After my first teaching lesson I was a bit discouraged---but after this one, I see how important just practicing teaching is.  I am so glad at times like this I am not going through some sort of alternative certification program----because if I didn't have this years worth of experience, and I was just thrown into a classroom, I would be so lost!  Okay, time to recover from the day.

      Friday in my literacy class we did an interesting exercise; we answered the following questions (plus some others):  1.  How many words do you know? 2.  How did you learn the words you know? 3.  How many words do you think a entering kindergarten knows? 4.  Have you ever been unable to follow a discussion because you didn't know the words?  What were those words?  I had never really thought of the answers to these questions before--but now that I have I really see the importance of stressing vocabulary in classes.  Science is such an important course to emphasize vocabulary in, because so many of the words in texts are new.  According to my literacy book, the average high school student learns 2,000-3,000 new words each year.  That is a lot, and doesn't even include symbols and abbreviations that many student have to learn.     Anyone have any creative methods for teaching vocabulary to high school students?  I know in science it is important and helpful to break words into their roots or parts.  It is also important to have student use context clues as to determine the meaning of a word.  But aside from vocabulary test and lists, are there any fun ways to implement vocabulary into high school classes? I can imagine that foreign language teachers might have some of the best methods of doing this, as there discipline revolves around teaching students new words.   My text book mention a few methods I thought I would share:  1.  Wordwall----have students place new words in a visible place in the room.  You can even go as far as to make a huge graphic organizer with them.  2.  Teaching student to use dictionaries (the obvious) 3.  Using alphabet books to introduce new terms---the text admits this may seem elementary, but it recommends certain books (Animalia, V is for Vanishing the Extinct Alphabet Book, and Aardvarks, Disembark!) for use in secondary classes)  I just thought of one that might be interesting to try---science scrabble.  Being an avid scrabble player I thought it could be interesting to have students play scrabble, but have them link all there words to science in some way.  They would have to defend their word, and state how it relates to science.  It may not connect with a certain lesson of course--but it would get them thinking and activate there minds.  May be good for a rainy day or time after a test.  I might try this next semester when I student teach---but maybe I should first try and play with my dad (a physicist)--and see if it is easy enough to do.

      I am only observing in the high school for about 4 hours a week---though some of my education classes take place off the university campus at the middle school.  Anyway this week was pretty uneventful.  The classes were all reviewing for a test they were to have the next day.  My mentor teacher was pulling numbers out of a cup, and would ask the corresponding student review questions.  I got to play Vanna and pull the numbers out of the cup--I got some dirty looks from kids when there number got called (as if my hands were picking on them personally).  Most kids were glad though when they got their number called, because they could earn bonus point by answering correctly.  I don't know how I felt about the review because I know I have a hard time when I just hear a question verbally, I have to see it written to really comprehend it---I think if I was to do a review game of this sort I would make a Jeopardy board of sorts---so that students could see the questions as well as a hear them-----but that would require a lot of time.  Do any of you current teachers use review games?  Do you see a marked different in test scores with review games, versus tests you did not do a review for?  In my science methods class Friday we had a nice discussion about the topic I wrote about on Monday Oct 27---how schools contribute to the obesity of kids.  We were doing an experiment in the class in which we boiled different types of meat to measure the fat content of each---it is amazing how much fat is in ground beef (yet another reason not to eat it, in addition to all the horror stories "Fast Food Nation" provides about the slaughterhouse industry).  Anyway we discussed how some schools have added a BMI component to students report cards---anyone out there dealing with this at their school?

      I have been checking out a lot of blogs lately on Weblog Review urlLink   and there seems to be a trend to do a list of a 100 facts about oneself.  So since I am up bored this evening I thought I would give it a shot.   1.	My name is K---- 2.	But really I am K-------- 3.	My middle name is J- 4.	I was named after my mother's two sisters Joanne and Kathy. 5.	My dad tells me I should be proud of my last name. 6.	He only says this in teasing because I have a messy signature. 7.	In fact all my handwriting is horrible 8.	I suppose that is why I can type so fast, I have to make up for the poor handwriting 9.	My dad is in the Air Force, so I have lived all around the US. 10.	Boston and DC have been my favorites 11.	While in college I finally got a chance to live in Europe. 12.	I studied abroad in the Netherlands 13.	I am ashamed to say I don’t speak Dutch 14.	One day in Amsterdam I got ran over by a bike. 15.	I walked away without a scratch, the bike did not. 16.	The owner of the bike yelled at me and walked away 17.	I also fell in love in Europe 18.	Not with a boy, but with travel. 19.	But I can’t travel more until I am done with school 20.	I study science and education 21.	I plan to be a teacher like my mom 22.	I was inspired to teach when I was in high school 23.	This "slacker" kid in class with me told me I could explain the concepts to him like no one else 24.	It made me feel like I could make a difference 25.	I once thought I could make a difference as a doctor 26.	but then I realized that I had already spent enough time in hospitals 27.	and that I wouldn't have the life I want 28.	I want to have my own kitchen 29.	and cook wonderful things in it 30.	If I could make something now it would be a mozzarella, basil, and tomato salad 31.	I love cheese 32.	but I don’t like onion flavored cheese (yes, this is a real thing) 33.	I have been to at least 4 different cheese factories in my life 34.	I seem to find them wherever I go, or they find me 35.	My life has not been that long yet, only 22 years 36.	I do look younger than my years 37.	I was offered the child’s menu until I was 17 38.	Now I am often confused with my students 39.	My younger sister looks older than me 40.	Older women say I will appreciate this when I am older 41.	Maybe I should appreciate it now 42.	When I am older I want to restore an old building 43.	I want to make it look young and vibrant again 44.	I once lived in a town with a glorious old movie theater that needed to be restored 45.	Maybe I will move there and buy it 46.	I would have someone remove the gum from under the chairs of the theater because I am afraid of yuck 47.	I hate having dirty fingers, I have to clean them right after they get dirty 48.	I also have a thing about brushing my teeth, I do it often 49.	probably too often 50.	I have never had a cavity though, so it’s can’t be to horrible for me 51.	But maybe I don’t have cavities because I don’t eat a lot of sweets 52.	except for Sour Patch Kids, I have a penchant for them 53.	I seem to have a lot of penchants though 54.	I enjoy chewing on erasers, 55.	Writing in my journal, 56.	And listening to loud music. 57.	I don’t have a favorite musical artist, 58.	I like them all 59.	I was once a singer, but I wasn't a performer 60.	I have decided you must be both to be successful in entertainment today 61.	I do think I will be famous though, don’t ask me why, just a feeling I get 62.	Maybe Ill just be famous in my school or classroom, but still I will be famous 63.	I used to dream about how I would set up my classroom 64.	I stopped having those dreams when I actually had to design it for a class 65.	the dream and the reality looked nothing alike, because I had to many restrictions laid down in the assignment 66.	I have come to realize in most instances that life is not like the dream 67.	I am okay with this realization, though I don’t stop dreaming 68.	I once kept a dream journal, but then I never devoted enough time in the morning to write in it, so it fell by the wayside 69.	I am a morning person 70.	I don’t ever wake up late  71.	My body has it’s own body clock that doesn’t ever let me sleep longer than 8 hours 72.	As long as I go to bed on time I will never wake up late 73.	This “gift” is the bane of my existence on weekends 74.	I think weekdays are better than weekends 75.	Maybe if I slept in I would think otherwise 76.	I don’t drink coffee in the mornings, or at all for that matter 77.	I love hot tea 78.	No sugar or cream, just straight hot tea 79.	I don’t eat breakfast, though they say it is the most important meal of the day 80.	I do drink half a gallon of milk each day at least, I should buy a cow 81.	I like my milk straight too-never chocolate 82.	I can’t draw a straight line for my life, in fact I can’t draw period 83.	I wish I had artistic talents 84.	I love admiring art 85.	I could spent all day in front of “The White Orchard” by Van Gogh 86.	Actually I did one day—or at least half of that day 87.	I wish I could spend more time looking at art 88.	I also wish I could spend more time reading 89.	I seem to gravitate towards non-fiction books more often than fiction 90.	I also gravitate to my guilty pleasure in life, The Real World TV show 91.	What is ironic is that it doesn’t depict the real world what so ever 92.	I used to think the real world would be scary, now I can’t wait to jump in 93.	My mom always said I was trying to grow up fast 94.	I would always rather converse with adults than to play with kids 95.	I hated having to sit at the kiddy table when I was a kid 96.	Now I am an adult and find myself voluntarily at the kiddy table 97.	I also find myself playing on the computer too much lately 98.	I canÃ‚Â’t believe I have spent so much time on this blog 99.	If you blog to much about life you really are not living it I say 100.	So now it is time for me to go live

      I just saw another great movie, in line with my favorite one  urlLink The Emperor's Club , it was  urlLink Mona Lisa Smile .  Julia Roberts played a teacher who really challenged her student to think beyond just her subject area, and yet to also think of the world in terms of her subject area.  I really hope that I am able to challenge my students in the same way. The movie was also good because it had a few unexpected twists, which are always nice in a recipe type Hollywood that we seem to have today.  Now I just need to get out to see the new Lord of the Rings--

      I finally found out the name of my mentor teacher for spring.  I have corresponded with her through email, and she is as excited as I am (which makes me very happy).  I found out that Ill be teaching Pre-AP classes and that the spring will mean covering topics of evolution, classification, and plants.  (I guess this means I missed dissection :(, but perhaps that is a good thing--I can only imagine trying to manage an animal dissection as one of my first teaching experiences).   She also informed me that the first week I am there students will be taking finals and then the students have Friday off for Teacher Record Day---this will give us a lot of time for planning together and such.  As I have already learned collaborative planning can take a while--so this time will be well used.  Oh--I am so giddy right now.

      I am so antsy when it comes to keeping one template on this thing--sorry if it is driving you crazy--believe me it is driving me batty.  I wish I was proficient enough about HTML to make a really swell template for this thing.  I just can't get exactly what I want.  I found this great hydrogen spectrum code--and thought it was appropriate being science and all.  Anyway--so Ill probably continue playing with it for a while--- until I settle sorry for the psychedelic changes.

      Went to my mom's school today and helped manage the kids while she played in the teacher-student basketball game.  As expected the game ended in a tie, which I don't feel really does justice to the event.  But I suppose it was impossible for the 6th grades to really beat the teachers due to the height difference and such. Some of those kids were skilled though---they could really fly down the court.  The kids who of course played the best where those donning shirt that read "This Basketball Summer Camp" or "That Local Basketball Team"--I almost think they did better than the teachers skill wise--if they were only a little taller.  At half-time (I almost wrote intermission then realized this was a sporting event) the 5th graders performed a dance they learned in gym class.  I think elementary gym has really changed from the days I look it, and that was only about 10 years ago (am I this old already?).  The kids did this hip-hop dance to some pretty good music.  Back when we did dance in gym I think it consisted of square dance and the electric slide--nothing this complicated---I was highly impressed.     I really didn't have much to in the way of managing the kids--my mom's class is fairly well behaved.  Had to tell one kid to stop touching another---but that was about it. Fhew----Tomorrow I plan on going by some human resource departments of some local school districts--just to make contact and such--going over my resume tonight with my dad to have him polish it a bit.....

      I went to the Scholastic Book Fair Warehouse today with my mom after she got out of school.  They were having a special sale for teachers and such, 50% off everything.  So there I was roaming around the shelves of the warehouse starting my I classroom library.  I think I got about 10 books, mostly novels with science themes and a couple field guides.      I also picked up a book for myself:     urlLink The Essential 55 by Ron Clark   .  I have only started reading it, and it seems pretty good so far.  I don't know how well I could manage implementing and maintaining 55 rules in my classroom, but many seem more procedural than anything so it might be manageable.   Ill let you know more about this book as I progress in reading it.

      Okay, I so wrote yesterday of my intentions to head to the placement office to get the final word about my placement (which begins Jan 12).  Well of course the Dr. In charge of placements was not in when I got there, and whether she would be in later in the day according to her secretary was somewhat debatable.  She then gives me her office phone number and tells me to check in later.    So, I sit in the hall to study for my last final and a professor I really respect and know walks by and asks me if I had heard about my placement yet--and reply no! And they are instantly a bit upset for me.  I then confide that I was planning on going to the dean of the ed department, and they warn me against that.  Apparently the placement Dr. and the dean are in cahoots together and anything I say will be taken with a grain of salt----if I can even get a appointment with the dean.  The trusted prof then advises me to go to my department head (biology) and inform them of the situation--and go over the placement Dr's head that route.  So I take my last final and head to the bio building.  I stop by my advisor's office first--to see if he has heard anything and to inform him of my plan.  He tells me I should proceed, but that the department head it out--so I decided that I go talk to the assistant dean of the college of math and science (because I am in good with him, and he offered me a research job for the spring, which I can't take because of student teaching)---anyway so I head to his office---and guess what---he is out for the day as well.  So finally I am at my wits end and I decide Ill just talk to the dean--and you guessed it he was out for the day too.  Does anyone work at my school????  Anyway so I call the placement Dr. and leave a message and about an hour later I get a response---so I guess she finally decided to show up for the day.  She says she has called the school district, and left a message with the pertinent office.  She said she was waiting to hear back, and when she did she would let me know-----well at least she called.  This happens at about 1 o'clock.  So 5 o'clock rolls around and I haven't heard from her---so I guess she never heard from them?!?  I hate to be annoying, but I am going to have to call her every hour on the hour tomorrow (just kidding).  But really it is getting down to the wire.   No I am so stressed that I don't even mind that I spent the past 2 hours watching the Trista and Ryan wedding..........hmm..........

      Still haven't heard about my placement---so tomorrow I am marching into the placement professors office and telling her she best ante up.  If she is irresponsive---it is off to the dean.

      So I registered on this site as a step in my job hunt.  Has anyone out there used it?  I am getting tons of emails already from school districts advertising certain positions.    Seems there are a lot of Earth Science jobs in the areas I am looking at working, but of course they are looking for someone right now, not for next year.  Anyway I think it would be rather keen to teach Earth Science.  Being a military brat I somehow got away with never having earth science in grade school (because I would always change schools--and different schools teach things in different grades), I had tons of life science---but I missed all the rock, mineral, volcanoes, mountain building and earthquake science until I was in college.  I was actually not really excited about my earth science class before I took it, and I ended up loving it.  I will be certified in both life and earth science--and I definitely don't think I would mind teaching earth science at all.

      So it is getting near the deadline for Arkansas to make a move on school consolidation.  The small towns are still fighting tooth and nail.  As an article in the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette details  (to view the online version you have to pay something---bah!) several small schools sent buses of students to stand outside the capital and "protest" the consolidation.  Students had posters saying things such as "Huckabee (the governor) hates me".  This all occurred during a school day--and was billed as a fieldtrip! These kids probably have no idea the real implications that not consolidating means for them and their futures.  Should students be forced to lobby for something they may not understand? I don't think so.  One small town citizen was asked if he believed that students at small schools got the same education and opportunities as those in larger schools.  He replied by saying that it was totally up to the individual student as to what they receive==and sighted a student who graduated in the 80's who was now pursuing a law degree as a success to small town schools.  So someone graduated over 10 years ago and they are now pursuing higher education?  Yes--this is a great example to share about how students from small schools are the equal.  As you can tell I really think there is a need to consolidate the schools--I have tried to see it all from the view point of the small town citizen, but it seems to escape me.  Anyway it is getting much more heated as the deadline approaches.  It will be interesting to watch to see what happens.

      I just got in from the meeting over in the education department with all the other people who have student teaching next semester.  Anyway--I am one of about only 10 who don't have placements confirmed.  It is so annoying.  I didn't get my questions answered directly, I really hate it when people skirt issues.  Arh....anyway it is still a waiting game.  So for now the boxes are packed in my room, waiting to head to LR.  I wish I could throw them in my car and wisk them away.

      I had my last classroom based undergrad class today.  From this point on it is just internship. For some reason this makes me a bit nervous--it means the end is near.  The end---reflecting back these five years have really made a change in me.  A change I like-----I can only imagine what lies ahead.

      I found this fun site the other day which has anecdotes about all sorts of subjects.  The following one lent very nicely to my nature of science paper:   urlLink Anecdotage.com - Thousands of Anecdotes, Funny Pictures, Insults, Jokes, Bloopers & Funny Stories: Einstein Exams Science Physics Questions Teaching   I used it as an introductory snippet.  I don't know why, but every paper I write has to be introduced by a quote, lyric or something else before the actual introductory paragraph.  This has never gotten an ill comment from a professor, so I guess it is okay.  I guess I will be more inclined to accept alternative writing styles from my students as well.  Maybe a skat about evolution? Or a haiku about invertebrates?  Or how about a rap about cellular respiration? I think they would all be awesome.  Any interesting writing assignments to share out there?

      Today my group and I presented our integrated unit to our classmates. I think it went well---okay, maybe not our presentation (the other group did markably better I think)---but our unit rocks.  Anyway it is over, so that means all I have left is to do three finals (one of which is take home).   Ill be done at this time next week.  Since I don't have to much school work going on recently I have been busy getting my resume polished and cover letters written.  I have decided that I am going to apply to teach overseas after all.  I was grappling over that decision for a while--but I realized that I should at least apply.  Working at the American schools on military bases would be an amazing experience.  So now I have done online applications for 3 school districts.  I know is only December and that the next school year is a while away--but I have a feeling once Jan 12 comes and I begin student teaching my time will be limited.  I plan on visiting some H&R departments over the holiday break while I am back home--at least to get my face and name in the mix---I figure it can't hurt.  This all reminds me that I need to get in touch with my boss this summer to see if I can get a few hours in while I am home.  So much to do, so little time.  I am getting really stressed because the education department still does not know where I will be placed for my student teaching.  It is actually annoying in many ways--because the department is all hyper about us students getting our information into them--but they are slow in letting us know.  I guess that is how every system is though, so I should get used to it.  Anyway I really wanted to move out this weekend--but I fear moving only to have to move back in.  Plus I have to break my lease with the housing department, and unless I want to pay 500 dollars I need to turn in paperwork saying that I will be student teaching outside the city limits my university is in-------awwww---  Oh yes, and there is still Christmas shopping to do------

      Thanksgiving break is over now, and I am back to my last 4 days of class before finals.  It should go pretty fast.  I am STILL waiting to hear for sure about my placement for student teaching next semester--that way I can start moving down to Little Rock, resign from my job, and turn in paper work as to not loose my housing deposit because I am breaking my campus lease.    Over the break the reality that I need to get my resume and cover letters together really hit me.  I also really need to contemplate where I want to apply, work, and live.  This all hit me because I went interview suit shopping--------something I asked my parents for as a Christmas gift.  Anyway the suit looks fab, so now I need to focus on revising my resume and making it look even better.      I hope it is going to be a busy couple weeks--and that they fly by fast.  Because Thanskgiving break just wasn't enough.

      The past two days were my first doing all the teaching myself.  So far I think it has gone fairly well.  The first period was my test time, and I got done a lot earlier than I had planned.  I think I kind of sped through the notes/lecture portion of the lesson.  I had actually taught this lesson in the fall at my other internship, so it was kind of lucky that I had experienced it before. 	The lesson basically consisted of teaching the students the structure of DNA and the process of DNA replication.  After a laser disc and my lecture, the students used a bead kit to construct a DNA molecule and then go through the steps of DNA replication.  I have to say; those kits are made extremely cheaply.  At the end of the day more than half of the white beads, which represented the deoxyribose, were broken.  And they were not broken because students were mistreating them or anything---it was simply because the things are CHEAP!  It is almost as if they want you to buy a new kit for each period of the day….no wonder it is hard for some school districts to have the supplies for students to do hands on activities.  	In other news I had my first parent-teacher conference today.  A student’s parents came in to discuss how they could help their child better achieve over the next semester.  He/she isn’t a poor student, in fact last semester they earned a B overall.  We gave him a plan of action as to how to better use his time in going over the material, and I emphasized the fact that my lectures would emphasize the important points and that those are what he should focus on when studying.  So, hopefully that will be helpful to him.  	This week has been spirit day at school.  Monday was Pajama day, and a lot of the girls were wearing some inappropriate wear—oh vey.  Today was tacky day and I didn’t take part.  Tomorrow is hat day, and I think I am going to wear this swell vintage hat that has netting and all---maybe Ill get as many reactions as the tie-skirt got me.   It is actually homecoming week; apparently we have two homecomings, one for football and one for basketball.  A lot of the kids have been asking me if I will be going to the dance---since my teacher isn’t going, I probably won’t be either------though it is a masquerade ball—which sounds pretty cool.

      Had a busy day in class today.  Aside from teaching todays lesson (having students look at karyotypes and figure out which disorder a patient has), I was busy getting ready for tomorrow---the first day when I take over.  I have my lesson all planned out--but I am still debating on whether to hand write notes on the overhead--or by making a print out.  Hm---I have a few hours this evening to figure it out.

      Good day at school today.  Only one more day and then I am on my own teaching for a while.  I am really getting to know the students and I think that we have a good reporte with each other.   We had an assembly today.  The principal wanted to review some of the school rules with the students.  I don't know if we have been having major problems in some areas---but it kind of seemed like a waste of time to me.........

      The past week has been so busy, that I have barely gotten a chance to really write.  This week my mentor and I started team teaching.  Since we have block scheduling she spends a day teaching a lesson, and the following day I take over some parts.  Today was a modeling day for her, and tomorrow I will take over part of the lesson.  The kids have been really receptive to me, though I worry I am not going to be as lenient on due dates and such—but I know I can’t shock them with change, things must relatively stay the same.  Since I am modeling tomorrow it means,  no chocolate martini’s tonight.  	Yesterday after school my mentor and I went to another school to judge their science fair.  There were about 10 projects entered into the microbiology category, so we picked it to judge together.  Apparently their fair was a bit low quality, and my teacher assured us that ours was much better. It couldn’t be much worst considering that at least 7 of the ten projects were bread mold based.  “How fast does bread mold”, “Which Food Molds The Fastest” etc.  Even though it was the schools first year, I still think the projects were a bit below even 9th grade level—more like 5th or 6th.    	Amongst the sadness of the state of affairs were some really comical things.  For instance this one student has written an acknowledgment page within their paper.  It went something like this:  	 “Above all I would like to thank God for giving me this day.  And my mother who is near and dear to my heart….” Quite endearing I must say.   	Wednesday was my day to take over the class, and I had gotten a chance to pass back some papers which helped me get to know some students names.  Since I am fairly good with names I was able to remember the majority of them.  So I was teaching class and I called on the  urlLink girl who had earlier asked me if I like students .  So I call on her—and she replies with “How do you know my name???”.  She is utterly dumbfounded that after only having her class once I remembered her name. I thought it was hilarious.  	So I am often mistaken for a student.  When I walk in every morning through the same door and encounter Mr. Smith the security guard.  He always asks me “Can I help you Maam?” as he does to all students.  I reply each time with “Morning, I am Ms. D’s student teacher.” To which he replies,  “Oh yes have a nice day.”.  We now the problem has come into the classroom.  Yesterday during my mentor’s planning period another teachers class came into the room, because their teacher had something to “do”.  Anyway so my mentor puts on a video for them (this is a physics class, not biology) and they begin to watch it.  My mentor is busy at the computer finalizing grades to send to the district for report cards, and needed silence.  So some kids in the back begin to act up and I ask one of them to come up to the front and sit.  He wasn’t very happy and the girl behind him says (thinking I can’t hear her of course) “She isn’t really even a teacher, she’s a student.”   I lay the smack down and say “You bet I am a teacher, so when I ask you to be quite you need to comply.”  She and he shut up instantly and didn’t give me a problem at al.  	So I have decided (with my university professors permission of course) to stop using the Pathwise lesson plan, and to rather use the districts.  It is much simplier to use, and should save me some time.  I know I think about all the aspects of the Pathwise lesson plan—so I am not really losing anything by not using it.  	Students are funny creatures. They make up excuses for anything.  I think Ill be documenting the funnier ones.  This one isn’t drop on the ground funny—but it was interesting to me.  “But tomorrow is my birthday.”  as an excuse to get out of today’s in class assignment.  And they wondered why there parent isn’t letting them get a car until summer…  	For all you biology teachers out their, we did a fun sex linkage activity with Easter eggs today-if you want details let me know.  	  First big sign that my school is in the city.  Today two of the security men came into the room to search students belonging.  Students had to leave the room while their bags and such were search for contra band.  I was in the room while the search was taking place, until my teacher took me out in the hall to see what was going on there.  In the hall students were lined up against the lockers in a single file line--and one at a time they got swiped down their body with a metal detector.  It was just like airport security.  The students are really used to this happening, I don't know if I will ever get used to it.

      My first full day of real classes today.  It was a long day--but a good day.  Since we have block scheduling we will teach the same lesson tomorrow to three different classes.  My mentor modeled the lesson today, so tomorrow it's all me---say a prayer.  After school tomorrow we will go to another high school to judge their science fair.  Apparently science fair is a big deal here in the district.  The student take part from grade school on.  Going to this one tomorrow so that I can see what I am in for when ours happens in Feb.

      Before I offically colapse tonight I thought I would write a bit.  This week is going to be crazy I feel!  Of course I have classes all this week--and on Wed I am going to another high school to judge at their science fair.  So much to do---  I spent today doing some more resume stuff (mostly getting cover letters in order) and I wrote out my formal lesson plans.  I hope they are good enough for my mentor teacher--I have no idea what she is expecting.  I know my university supervisor would be happy with them---but you never know.    I am suppose to teach for the first time tomorrow. I am a bit nervous about it all.  So wish me luck.  Have I mentioned that I have a slight fear of public speaking?  I suppose I just try and pretend I am putting on one of the programs I used to do in my residence hall.  It might help---anyway---it is only 6 pm--but I am thinking bed time is in order soon.........well maybe after some mindless entertainment.

      Finally--got comments back on my blog--for anyone who was using Blogspeak you know what happened--for anyone who doesn't--don't worry about it.  Anyway it is no lazy Saturday here.  Working on getting resumes, cover letters, and educational philosophy all in order.  Once that is done I need to get down to writing formal lesson plans for the unit on DNA that I am going to start teaching in a couple weeks *(yes, I am an over achiever working weeks ahead).   Anyway the week rounded out well.  Yesterday was a teacher work day and my mentor and I planned out what were were going to be doing for the next 4 weeks.  Also got to witness parents trying to save their children's grades at the last minute.  Which is very interesting...

      Today we only had to give one final, because the other final period was her planning period.  This gave us a chance to catch up and grade some of the finals and get them into the grade book.  We were also able to plan next week’s activities and get copies made which we would need.  The more planning we do, the closer the date that I am going to start teaching on my own is moved up.  This scares me a bit.  I really am worried about what to do when and if students ask me questions that I cannot answer.   	 	A funny thing happened after I introduced myself to the class today.  At the end of my shcpeal I told them that if they had any questions for me they could go ahead and ask.  Well the class got back to their chit-chat and then a kid asked me “What is your favorite color?”  I saw this to be an elementary question, and since I don’t really have a certain affinity for a color I replied “I don’t have one.” I guess this answer didn’t satisfy him, so he had to ask another.  “What is your favorite Chinese Dynasty?”  I stood there for a second, and replied “I am rather partial to the Ming Dynasty.”  Then I walked away.  Behind me I heard the kid next to him laugh at him—and he say “I didn’t expect that answer”. I was definitely quick on my feet with that one---quite proud of myself.  	The storeroom in back of the science room has artifacts of science so old; they have to be antiques for sure. The sight of 60 year old bugs--- not very pretty-------I will try to avoid this place as much as possible!  	My mentor teacher gave me an interesting article to read “Counseling the Science Student,” (College Bound, Nov 2003).  The article citied that students who do best in college science are those who have participated in science fairs and science clubs.  This is pretty common sense I think.  The article also discussed that more women are going into the helping science fields than the engineering type fields.   Only 13 percent actually go into engineering, physics, and computer science. I think that it is important to the future of our country that we encourage students to head into this fields, so that we don’t fall any further behind other countries.  According to this article we can gear more women into these fields if we give them the confidence, as well as familiarity with the fields themselves.

                      Day two is over—and I am already feeling quite comfortable in my placement.  I met two new classes of  students and was delighted by both.  The morning started off on a humorous note when a student asked me “are you a new student”, when I replied, “No, I am your new student teacher.”  She said “Yeah, I thought you were a new student.  You look really young”.  It was bound to happen.  So anyway I give the class an introduction to myself and at the end inform them that if they have any questions of me they can feel free to ask, and if throughout the semester they have any critic or advice for me as a teacher I would gladly welcome it.  A girl raised her hand and asked, “Do you like kids, I mean teenagers?  Because the last student teacher we had didn’t.”  I confirmed that I did like students and that I wouldn’t be in the field if I didn’t.  I think the answer appeased her—but I suspect her to be suspicious of me for a while.    	My mentor and I then administered the exam.  It went much smoother today, now that we have a system for passing it out.  There are four parts we had to pass out.  The first two were the scan-tron type answer sheets.  One for her to grade, and the other for the district (they are now starting to accumulate data on exam test scores to help them determine how to raise scores because of NCLB).  So in essence the students have to mark their answers on two score sheets—which was a bit confusing to them.  The second two parts where the actual test.  The test was so thick that we couldn’t staple it into one piece—so we had to do two.  As you can guess this got a bad reaction from students—the test is how long?!?   	 	My mentor teacher is really understanding of students as they take exams.  For instance one boy (who was sitting at the high lab tables) was more comfortable standing in is place than sitting.  It was really quite interesting watching him alternate between the two.  Other students need additional time, more than the allotted two hours—and she freely gave it.   	We had a nice lunch today given by the parent organization.  The brownies were to good---yum.  It was good to have that highlight of the day before the big sadness.  The sadness came when reading one students free response answer.  The question was to compare and contrast an animal and plant cell---and in the response the student compared animals and plants---and in really poor grammar to add it that.  According to my mentor this student should not have been placed in the Pre-AP class, and next semester she will be moved to the regular class.  Hopefully she will be able to be more successful there.  	After school the kid who stood during his exam came to work on his science fair project.  This kid absolutely cracks me up with his lab technique.  He needed to clean out some beakers and this was his method.  He began by spraying some All Purpose Cleaner in the beaker, then filled it with water. Now for the best part---he placed his hand over the top of the beaker and shook it up and down.  I believe this will produce a really clean and sterile beaker which he needs for his bacterial growth experiment.  Anyway he is one of those intelligent kids who has his head in the clouds, his is definitely going to be entertaining this semester.    	Talked more with my mentor today about the plan for this semester.  We are going to really lay it all out on Friday, but we pretty much determined that we are going to team teach for the next two weeks—then I will take over the class.  This is much sooner than I thought, but I imagine I will be fine. She explained her teaching methods to me, and basically every day consists of a lab or activity—she rarely lectures.  This is great because that is just the way that I want to teach—I am very hopefully that I can learn a lot from her.  Also my university supervisor came by for his introductory visit—my mentor then realized she knew him from science fairs of the past—so hopefully that connection will make their communication go smoothly.  Alright—that is all for today.

      	Today was my first day as an official student teacher, and I have to say overall it was a great day.  I got to the school a bit early and checked in at the office-then asked the office lady if I would need to check in as a visitor everyday—and she said she knew it was a pain, but that I would have to.  Argh.  Anyway later in the day when I told my mentor teacher about that she said no way would I be checking in as a visitor everyday---I was going to be treated just like a teacher.  She then said she would get that all straightened out.  She also got me the forms to get a parking pass and such.  I asked her if she ever had vandalism done to her car, she said she has had some minor damage over the past 27 years—but nothing horrible.  	Anyway so the children arrived at school.  This week is exam week so the students have two exams each day, and then Friday is a teacher work day.  The finals schedule really makes it an ideal first week of student teaching, because it is giving my mentor teacher and I some real time to get organized together.  So I observe her administering the final—and getting some last minute semester issues out of the way.  During the final I read the massive amount of information she has provided me with: Teacher Handbook, District Required Lab, Lesson Plans she has used in the past.  After I am done routing through all that she asks me to go around and spot check student’s free response questions on the test.  It was good to see what to expect from them as far as writing goes---it really made me realize how much one grows as a writer in college.    	Later in the period the adjacent classroom teacher took me to the copy room and we discussed pedagogy a bit.  He warned me not to do what he had done when he first started teaching---to not lecture the whole class and to not make the class your own song and dance—to allow the students ownership.  It was good advice I will heed.  Since he teaches both regular and pre-ap biology I asked him what the difference where between the two.  He says primarily the difference lies in attitude.  Pre-AP students are of course the go-getters and want to get an A, while students in the regular class want to get by with a C-----.  He really made me see how important attitude is for a student.  At the end of our conversation he invited me to observe his regular class anytime—an offer I will surely be taking him up on.  	After the first final period it was time for lunch: 30 minutes!!! Apparently just enough time to shove some food in ones mouth.  A couple other teachers joined us in the classroom for lunch.  It was a nice but short time.    	After devouring my turkey sandwich and carrots, it was time to give another final.  In this class I got an opportunity to take roll, which gave me a chance to get to know some of the students’ names.  After giving out the tests, I helped my teacher update her grade book on Grade quick---and print off grade sheets so that each student could have an accounting of what she had recorded for them.  Despite her giving them a grade sheet to keep record of everything she turns back to them, they don’t keep track and constantly ask her about their grade.    	The end of the students’ day came quickly, as they were dismissed at 1:30 today.  Some students then came after school for a botball meeting and some to work on their science fair projects.  I had never heard of botball until today, but now I know it is robotics team which is just now forming.  They have a competition in March—and get a kit and project in February and have only 6 weeks to work on it.  Did that make sense?  Anyway my teacher is advising the team, so I suppose I will get to experience it as well.  I’ll take all the experience I can.  	Two students stayed to work on their science fair projects.  One who is doing an experiment to detect salmonella on grocery produce, and another who is going to determine if different colors (wavelengths) of light allow bacteria to grow at different rates.  One kid was really on top of his/her project, while the other really had to be coddled about it.  I guess there are going to be a lot more of these days after school where we help them—which should be fun. So they left and then we got to leave a bit early, at 3:30 early enough to beat traffic.    It has only been the first day, but already I think it is going to be a good experience.  When I got home I heard from one of my classmates—and apparently she is having a horrible experience.  I figure if the worst thing that happens to me is that one of my students resembles someone I used to date it won’t be a half bad semester.  (Oh yeah, and the teachers bathroom was kind of gross too.)

      Went to the university today for some pre-student teaching meetings.  They were of course long and boring.  I really wish that people would read what is required of them, so that meetings in which the same topics are covered wouldn't be necessary.  I am a person who reads everything I am asked----so to hear it all again verbally is just plan annoying. I suppose Ill have to deal with things like this when I am in the workforce--no matter which workforce I enter.  Thus is life.  Despite the rats I am feeling pretty good about my placement.  The other two science interns will have to teach 3 different subjects per day each---and me I only have to deal with one.  I have to say I was pretty smart to pick a larger urban school opposed to a rural one.    HAHA.  Watching Style Court aka trash TV.--and there is this former dork trying to get his dork friend madeover-----so much guilty pleasure--------

      I pulled my car into the area surrounded by chain link fence and walked up the many stair to the main office of the school.  After checking in and getting my visitors nametag, I head to the computer lab which my mentor teacher told me I could find her in.  I didn't know it until I got their but the students class day ends at 3:45--much later than I for some reason imagined.  Anyway so I walked in my classroom wearing my suit and instantly the teacher knew who I was.  Students were on the computers using a tutorial to practice some genetics problems in preparation for the next weeks final.    After school ended I walked with the teacher to her classroom.  The school was built in the 1920's and for some reason this information didn't prepare me for what I was to see at all.  The classroom was very old, interesting architectural details aside it was falling apart.  It is a good think it is scheduled for renovations in the coming years.  Anyway the plaster was peeling the lab desks tortured and everything else looked warn down.  Anyway it is certainly going to be a challenge for a neat and tidy freak like me to get over the appearance of the place.    We then headed to the faculty meeting, which was held in the choir room.  Apparently the meeting used to be held in the auditorium, but the teachers seemed to space themselves out to much for the likes of the principal, so it was moved to smaller quarters.  Smaller quarters indeed! Almost to small as not everyone had a seat.  The meeting was apparently the shortest they had ever had. Topics such as raising standardized test scores, process for giving students no credit, and an up coming open house were discussed.   During the no credit discussion, in which students should be given no credit if they had to many absences, many teachers asked questions.  Then some teacher piped in and said "Hey I propose we save individual questions for a later time"----------but in a rather rude way.  Anyway apparently staff meetings can get vicious here!  At the end of the meeting several teachers with perfect attendance names were drawn from a hat for a monetary drawing---a pretty nice incentive I think to having teachers attend school each day.  After the meeting my mentor teacher and I headed back to the classroom while she packed up to leave.  At the staff meeting the PTA had provided sodas and cookies.  Well she had brought a snack pack of cookies back with her and set them on the desk while she was packing.  As we were about to leave she noticed the cookies, grabbed them and said "better take these so the rats don't get them".  "RATS?" I said. "Yes, big as cats," she replied.  I then retorted with a "for real?" and she then proceeded to tell me they have a lot of rats and mice that live in the walls--then she said that I was a biology teacher and I shouldn't mind them.  HAHA.  Yeah right--I am the most prissy girl---I don't do rats, dead or alive! Especially ones the size of cats.  Stay tuned-because if I ever see one you are sure to read about that experience here.  I knew that my mentor teacher would think that I look really young.  When I got home tonight I had an email telling me that:  "You looked great!  And, you will want to look older and professional until you get the respect and attention of the kids.  After a few days you can relax a bit."    Made me really laugh, because anyone who has been reading my blog for a while will know that this is something I fear--I will be heeding her advice though--because I do want to command respect in the classroom right off.  I know though, that I won't be able to wear my suit and pearls everyday-----I am just not that formal! Oh wait--yes I am.

      I received another email from my mentor teacher today.  She informed me that tomorrow is their staff meeting for the month of January and that I am welcome to attend if I wish.  I guess tomorrow is the day I will get to meet her for the first time, which is exciting.    The students take finals next week, my first week in class.  Apparently the final will cover the topic of  Introduction to Biology, Cell, Biochem, Transport, Cell Reproduction, Ecology, Genetics, Respiration and Photosynthesis. The classes are all 10th grade Pre-AP Biology classes, which will make it really easy on me as far as preps go.  At least that is what I am hoping.  A classmate of mine is student teaching in a small town, so she is student teaching under a teacher who teaches three separate subjects. She is going to have to do preps for Anatomy and Phys, Botnany, and AP Biology.  I don’t envy her at all.  I know that one subject is going to be enough for me to focus on.    While I passed the Biology content Praxis with flying colors I still fear that I may not be prepared.  I know I can not possibly answer every question students are going to lay before me, but what if when called on I can’t retrieve even the most basic content from my mind.  I guess those are just things that will work themselves out, and as long as I prepare myself the best I can–Ill do well.  My mentor teacher also informed me that the science fair is a big deal at the high school, and she as the departmental head, seems to be spearheading it.  This should be a good experience for me as I have actually never taken part in a science fair since 5th or 6th grade.  I can imagine it would be something I need to experience because I might be put in charge of one when I receive a teaching position.  I am sure Ill have tons to write about tomorrow after I meet her and I attend the faculty meeting.  Oh..just got another email from here--seems she doesn't use the textbook much--hoorah!

      It has been so long since I have touched this thing that I figure I better get a few words in before my student teaching begins and my life goes into chaos mode.  It is going to be so weird to go from 3-4 hours of classes a day to over 8 hour days including prep and grading!  Anyway I still officially have three more days of break, so no need to think about that to deeply quite yet.  I don't start in the school till next Monday, but this Thursday and Friday I have orientation meeting at the University in which our supervisors will tell us what is expected of us.  The Internship is 12 credit hours and in order to get an A I have to be found proficient in the 4 Praxis domains (if you don't know what these are, believe me you don't want to).  I also have a litany of assignments to complete as well as a portfolio to compile.  It is going to be a crazy semester.  I just know this 12 hour semester is going to be a lot more harsh than any 18+ semester I have ever had.  I would like to mention I have always had 18+ semesters---this should be a break---what a crock.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that I drove by the school to find out it's exact location.  I have to say it isn't in the nicest neighborhood----but it is a beautiful school.   So I have noticed that many people have added New Years resolutions to their blogs.  Well I have no resolutions of substance really--I live a perfect life (just kidding) .  So--I figured I would make a blog resolution.  I resolve to title each entry with a line from a song.  I know it is kind of lame--but I have a friend who every time we email we title the emails with crazy song lines--it is almost a competition of sorts---so anyway I am going to add a bit of fun to my blog---feel free to guess song title and or artist.

      Well the week rounded out nicely.   Wendesday and Thursday I started my "unit" on classification.   I don't know if you can really considered two days of teaching a unit, but that is what I have.  So anyway I introduced it with a lecture, and then I had students create their own cladogram.  All students were to start off with the "E. furball" species that I drew on the board, then by adding derived characteristics they were to end up with 6 new species.  Some of the kids were so creative.  One students furball ended up being a dragon.  I was highly impressed with the kids artistic skills....especially since I have few, if any.   I had taken over 100 pictures at the science fair and I gave the kids a slideshow of them in class.  They really seemed to love it.  It gave me a better idea of who in one class is friends with kids in another class......  My university advisor came to observe me on Thursday.  I recieved all proficient marks (the highest possible).  So I suppose I am doing well.  I am very critical of myself though and know there are areas I really need to improve in.  I didn't go to school on Friday, rather I went to my university for the teacher job fair they were holding.  I knew most of the schools were going to be from this state, and even though I know I am moving back to DC I thought the experience would be invaluable.  I was able to talk to many schools and even had some mini interviews.  When the reps saw me walking by wearing a name tag that said "Life/Earth Science, Secondary" I was nearly attacked!  It is really nice to be wanted.    By chance a rep was their from Richmond, VA.  Talking to her gave me some insight to getting a teaching job back home.  Apparently none of the Virginia colleges produce students who can teach earth science---so I have a certification that few others will have there-----marketable?  I would have to think so.....

      Today was kind of crazy.  Made me really tired.  The day started off with four middle school science departments visiting our science fair.  This entailed us finding tour guides (our students) to take groups of 10 middles schoolers on a tour of the park, museum, building and science fair.  It started out fairly smoothly, but around 11 o’clock things got kind of crazy when it was time for one school to leave and their departure time hadn’t been made clear to the tour guides.  Some of those groups didn’t get back to the gym until 11:30 and the middle school teacher wasn’t to happy.    	I ended up giving a tour with a student because we were short on students to be guides.  It was kind of nice because it gave me an opportunity to see the park, museum and other parts of the building for the first time myself.  It is really quite a lovely facility.    	After all the middle schoolers left it was time for a quick lunch and then the awards ceremony.  The ceremony was kind of crazy, as the students in the bleachers didn’t really know how to behave well.  It was completed in less than an hour though—I thought this a small feet considering there were almost 100 prizes to give out.  And the prizes!  How nice they were.  Winning students received blankets, stuffed tigers, mugs, and CD cases.  Not bad I would say.  	After the awards it was time to get the gym back to it’s normal condition.  THAT was INSANITY.  We hadn’t developed a nice system for students to turn their things in, so it was kind of chaoitic collecting all their papers, backboards, and such.  I almost wish I had been able to stay longer on Sunday and had gotten to grade the rest of the backboards so they were not sitting in the room.  The room now looks a complete mess. So much to do the rest of the week---and Mr. Mimms is coming!

      The day of science fair has finally arrived.  It was an awesome, but long day.  I arrived at the school about 7 am and didn’t leave until 5.  And the whole time I was there I was moving, moving, moving.   Security gave me a walkie-talkie at the beginning of the day, and I was in charge of keeping track of it.  It was necessary to have in case we needed security through the day, fortunately we didn’t have any problems.  	Most of the day dealt with getting students in the right locations.  I think my students did fairly well at the fair, lots of them won awards.  I feel like a proud mom.   Some of the projects were really impressive, while some of them were rather disappointing.  I spent most of the day also going around with a camera taking pictures of the kids with their display boards.  They really love having their picture taken.    	I think that  kids really believe I know everything---they ask me everything and anything----  And now I sleep....

      	Today we set up the gym for the science fair.  It was really an all day affair, but kind of fun.  We first had to cover the floor in plastics, then arrange the tables, then label the tables with the students name of who would be setting there.   Most of the kids did a lot of work, but some just chose to sit around and do nothing.    	A few incidence happened.  One girl got her purse stolen, and it was later found in a boys bathroom (missing car keys and cash only).  Some other students thought it would be genius to do a backflip off the bleachers….and at least they didn’t get hurt—but it was quite a show. 	 	Took in my camera to take pictures of my darlings—wish I could share them here.  They are just so cute!

      Today was a good day at school.  Gave B day their tests back, and it went much smoother than A day.  I also gave out interim reports and that went fine as well.  A few kids tried to blame me for assignments that had claimed to turn in (group work, and I check all possible locals for it on my end), but really didn't.  It seems no one wants to take responsibility for themselves.    I kid told me I was the smartest teacher in the school today.  I took the kids to the computer lab to do an  urlLink evolution activity . Anyway I had printed out a chart for them to fill in evolutionary evidences they found on given web sites.  The kid raised his hand and asked it would be okay it he typed the chart in a word document, rather than filling in the worksheet by hand.  I told him, while that would look nice I wouldn't want him to end up taking any sort-cuts by using the "control-c".  He looked at me and said "You are the smartest teacher in this school, no one else would have caught onto that until I was near done."  I thought this was a nice addition to the comment made by a student the other day when they told me they thought I had a devious mind because I thought of their possible misconduct before they even did it.  Muhahaha.  Got some last minute science fair stuff done today....tomorrow we set up the gym.  Get to wear jeans!  Yeah.

      I stayed home sick yesterday from school.  And while it was kind of a nice respite, I was not prepared for the chaos I would return to.  When you miss a day and have a sub there it really gets you behind, no matter how awesome the sub.  This was also not the week to miss considering we have the science fair coming up and kids need last minute help with their projects. On top of all that there is business such as getting the science fair name tags, judges sheets together, and clip boards arranged.  It was such a crazy day.    	At the end of the day however I was feeling caught up and the lesson was successful.  Kids really do say and ask the darnest things some times.  Today a student (remember they are in 10th grade) asked me why when she drank more water was her urine more clear than when she drank less.  I couldn’t help but chuckle.  I explained the body systems and how they worked---so it was a teachable moment.  	Kids also made me feel good as they said they missed me and such.  Aw, that nice warm feeling really makes it worth it.                  Oh yeah, handing back and going over a test----what a job.  I don't even want to think about that madness that went on today.

      Home sick from school today.  To add to it my mentor teacher is out today as well.  So we had to actually get a lesson plan over to the sub real fast.  Forgot to mention that some of my students send me on of those Candy-grams they had for valentines day fundraiser.  How sweet.  Time to go back so sleep.

      The week is over, and it couldn't come soon enough.  The second day of teaching evolution went much smoother than the first.  Also my university advisor came to observe.  He said I did a great job.  I got proficient rating on most catagories (you can only get a distinguished rating if you are a grad student, so I did the best I could.)  He gave me a few areas to work on, but I wish he had given me a bit more to grow on.    Today we didn't have students because it was PCEP day. That means that parents come in to talk to counselors and teacher to figure out their childs educational plan for the next year.  In addition to the parents floating in and out of the room to find out information about science classes we also had two parents teacher conferences.  One 504 conference and another A student conference (still trying to figure those out).  Anyway it turned out to be a productive day because I was able to get interim reports made---they are all ready to go out on Monday.  The past two days I had my students read some primary source writings by Darwin, Lamarck, and Wallace.  Using them they had to write a paper on who they agreed or dissagreed with.  I haven't read them yet, that is my task for the weekend.  Even though I have been teaching for a couple weeks now, I think I am going to use this assignment to really how them what I will be expecting as far as quality goes.  I have taken the past couple weeks to see what they can do, now it is time to challange them.  Hopefully the papers will be good.

      Starting teaching evolution today. Ei Ei Ei.  The first period was horrid, but it got better through the day.  I am kind of frustrated with all this Higher Order Thinking (HOT) talk they did in the program.  I would be happy if they would just think period.  They want answer given to them on a silver platter and yet they are so afraid to be wrong.  I wish I could break them of this habit, but at this point I almost think it is best for me to just submit to them.....as you can tell today was frustrating.    Some funny things have occurred lately.  One kid in my class had taken his braids out and became the spitting image of a grammy winning artist.  So I said "hey, you know you look like Dre 3000?"  He looked at me and said no, I don't.  Well other kids hear this and they totally agreed with me on my analysis.  One girl however questioned me.  "You listen to Outkast".  When I affirmed that I did and asked her why I wouldn't she said "Well i just figured you listened to biology music".  Well if anyone out there knows of any good biology music let me know......hehe.   Also I kept calling him Dre--and it seemed to really tickle him.  Despite how horrid my day was there is always a silver lining.  Today when I went out to my car I checked my voice mail and there was a message from a principal of a school I had sent my resume to last week.  Yeah!  I have an interview lined up for when I go home over spring break. Funny thing is---the high school is my alma mater.....I am sure that has no bearing considering it's size and such....but I have contemplated working there--and that could prove interesting.  It would give me a totally different view point---and I would have kids looking through old year books finding my picture-----aw....  Alright well I need to sleep.  My university supervisor comes to watch me tomorrow.  Cross you fingers for me.

      Today I gave my first test.  After first period I was really discouraged at the scores.  The highest score was a 91.  And that was the only A.  I had hopes that the next period would be better, but that class only supplied two A's.  By this time I was feeling really down.  I realized I really needed to reflect on my teaching---what had I not done right?  I thought that all my lessons went fairly well.  Well third period rolled around and 6 A's came out of that class.  It made me feel a little bit better.  I was also discouraged by the attitude of the students as well.  They really didn't want to take a test, and they showed it!  It was almost getting me mad and moody, but I maintained my composure and made it through the day.    Anyway tomorrow is B day, and I am hopefully their grades will be better....but that will remain to be seen.

      We have block scheduling at my school.  The way it works is that we have A and B days with 4 classes each day.  This means that I only see a certain set of students every other day.  Well, there is a big difference between my A and B day classes.  While the classes are the same level and size, A day is much easier that B day.  B day seems to have alot more classroom managment issues and such.  It is almost amazing how different the days are.    Anyway, so at the end of B day I feel like my voice is completely gone.  While I have taken to standing in front of the class in silence until I get their attention, I often feel as though I am having to talk over them.  Dispite drinking lots of water my voice has fallen victim to the the day and I sound like a frog afterwards. Any tips to not loosing your voice for you vet teachers out there?

      So the week is now over.  Several things of note have happened which has delayed my writing.  The first is that my laptop broke.  Well actually just the male end of the power supply bent out of place, therefore it could not be charge up.  So the laptop is now in a FedEx box on it's way to California to be fixed.  So I now must fall back on the trusty ol desktop.  The second reason I have not written in a  while has been because I just plan haven't found a moment to spare.  Life has been so busy, and when I find some brief moments when I am not doing anything--mindless entertainment is more my speed.  So anyway--a weeks recap.  I had 3 parent conferences this week.  Luckily no parents telling me that they hoped their son would be motivated by my good looks.  Two of the conferences were 504 conferences--and of course all the conferences were related to the fact that report cards came out this week.  Why is there is delayed reaction from parents???  After the report card comes out, now they are worried about their child grade---the insanity.  The past two days I took the students to the computer lab and helped them make graphs with Excel for their science fair project.  The computer ability ranges were great.  Some kids made the graphs with their eyes closed (okay, not really), while others had to be guided step by step.  I would like to take the kids into the computer lab again soon.  We are going to be starting evolution soon, so I am on the hunt for a good internet evolution activity if anyone knows of one.  Monday I am giving my first test.  I am hoping that my students are prepared.  It will really be time for me to reflect once I have in mind how effective my teaching has been over the past few weeks.  Oh yeah, I did this really great DNA--> mRNA codons --> tRNA anticodons---> sentences activity which the kids simply loved.  I even had another teacher ask me for it.......yeah.

      Okay, when I tell people that I am teaching high school science, one of the first things that comes out of their mouths is that--"I bet your boy students have such a crush on you".  It is getting quite annoying and personally I am sure they see me as an old woman at 22.  Anyway so the other day when I wrote about my first parent-teacher conference I left out one big part of the conversation.  My mentor introduced me as the student teacher, and explained that I would be teaching the class for the majority of this semester.  Well the father pipes in "oh that will be nice, maybe it will give my son some motivation.  I remember when I was in high school and we had a young teacher we boys were always really eager to please her and do well." The the mother pipes in about how she agreed and that young men seem to respond better to young women.  I was totally shocked---here I was being professional--and they are telling me that they hope their son would find some motivation in my presence.  Totally embarrassing.    In other news teaching is going quite well.  My students were impressed that they could see the DNA we extracted from the strawberry with their bare eyes.  And they thought my quiz wasn't to hard.  The grades on it kind of laid across the board, so I am guessing it was a pretty good quiz.  The students have also told me that they like the style in which I am lecturing.  I am doing a rather interactive lecture in which I pose a question (visually on the overhead as well as verbally), and then we discuss the answer.  We will see if it really got the information to then when they take the test.

      Today I had my last observation by my university supervisor. It went really well.  No complaints.  The kids seemed to like the power point I made for today's lesson.  I also gave them a quiz via power point. I had five short answer questions, and put one per slide.  I then had it timed so that each question was visable for 60 seconds.  It seemed to work really well.  Some of the kids did well---but some had definately not studied.    I need a nap.

      Today felt like Thursday.  Why I am not exactly sure.  My lesson went pretty well today, though my first period class was crazy.  The kids really get a kick out of me talking about how sponges sexually reproduce.  Basically there is a big sponge orgy and all sponges in a location (which are hermaphrodidic) release their sperm at once---and it makes its way to other sponges to fertilize eggs---bet they didn't know invertebrates could be so interesting....just wait till they hear about the other orgies in the animal kingdom.  The true accomplishment of the day was getting grades all done--so I dont' have to worry about that for the rest of the week.  Tomorrow I get observed for the last time by my university professor.  I have a feeling my lesson is going to go really well. I am doing a big powerpoint presentation on Cnidarians----and I am even giving a quiz via powerpoint--so I should definately get a check under the technology catagory.  Found out that I will accompany my mentor to the state science fair on Friday--back at my university.  It will be weird to be back on campus during a school day I feel.  But I will get to experience a field trip which is a good idea.

      Started my unit on animals today.  And I felt my lecture was the best I have ever given, perhaps because the material is some of my favorite.  I started today with the Phylum Porifera.   I took Invertebrate Zoology and it was one of my favorite courses.  My mentor teacher said that I showed more enthusiasm for the material in today’s lesson.  I think this is a good thing, but how can I include some of that enthusiasm into lessons that I don’t care for so much.  I think I could do this by trying to find more innovative teaching methods and activities for the kids for that material.  To make it more fun for the kids, could also make it more fun for me.    	In other news no school tomorrow, as it is teacher record day.  Also—found out that I will be teaching earth science next year.  This makes me pretty excited.

      Today was the second day back after break, and it was a lot better than the first day back.  I think the kids had so many spring break stories to share with each other.  What I thought was nice is that so many kids so asked me how my break was.  They seemed to want to know what I did—or they were just delaying taking the test they had today.  Yes, I gave a test after only one day back from spring break.  At first when I was reviewing with the kids  I was a bit worried that they hadn’t retained anything over the break. But after giving and grading the test, I was relieved.  The grades were higher than they had been on my previous test, but I do have to say this test was a bit easier than the others.  The material, botany, is overall easier material than the previous material has been. I also think that I have gotten into a groove of presenting material in various ways, so this is helping the kids as well. 	 	I only have four more weeks in my student teaching placement.  Since I was kind of thrown into teaching when I first got into my placement I didn’t get the opportunity to observe in some other classes. Since I may be teaching Earth science next year in the position I got, I really need to observe that a bit.  So over the next few weeks my mentor and I are going to start team-teaching and getting me into various classrooms to observe.  Since I am in a pre-AP biology class day in and day out I really need to observe in a “normal” classroom for a while. In my current classes I don’t really have many classroom management issues as teachers in more diverse classrooms do.  Since I will be teaching in one of those diverse classrooms next year, I need to witness that a bit more.  	Over the break I got a teaching position for next year.  The interview process was not as rough as I thought it would be.  I had a team interview with an assistant principal and the head principal.  At the end of the interview I was invited to observe at the school the next day.  So I did that, which I definitely think helped me get the job.  Employers like it when you show more interest than showing up for a interview.  Observing though did make me extremely excited about working at the school.  I was there for one period in the morning, the lunch period.  All the science teachers eat lunch together and have a great collegiality.  After meeting a lot of the teachers at lunch I was then able to observer a biology and an earth science class.  All the classrooms are so nice, and seem to be well equipped.  	Sometimes I wonder if I am really adopting my own teaching style, or if I am simply assimilating what my mentor teacher would be doing.  I am developing the lesson plans and such, but I have kind of been modeling them similarly off what we did team teaching the first week.  Now that the students are done with their science projects I feel I can implement some more alternative type assessment.  I think I might do a group project/team teach activity in the class.  We are starting on the different phylum of animals and think this might be a good way to pull them into the content more.  I know I can’t totally restructure the class and change my mentor teachers rules, but I am able to reflect and decide what things I will want to do differently when I have my own classroom.  I will defiantly have certain procedures that I will want my students to follow and be able to set up a certain climate in my room from the get-go.  I think it might have helped if I had described my educational philosophy to students (not in as many words as it is written)---that way they can be engaged in a more active way in class. It would give them a better idea of what I expect from them. I don’t want them to be passive observers, but active participants.

      The day is over--except for the planning I have to do tonight.  All three classes were horrid today...talk talk talk talk.  My lesson on viruses did go really well though despite that.   Tommorow I give A day their botany test.  Hopefully they will do well.  After the test I start the unit on Animals. I am really excited about that.  Of course we are starting off with invertebrates, and I absolutely loved my invert zoo class.  The animals are just so interesting. I hope I can intrigue the kids about the.    Anyway a couple of you got out of my Friday five that I got a job offer.  Yes, I had an interview last week and scored the job.  So now I know what I am going to be doing next fall-(if it is teaching earth science or biology I am not sure exactly)-which while nice and secure is kind of scary all at the same time.  To leave the confines of my safe college life and head out into the real world of bills is kind of overwhelming.

      If you...  1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve? This may be the hardest question ever considering I am such a foody---but perhaps a resturant in which every dish had cheese as an ingredient.  I would call it Fromagorie.  2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell? I would sell shoes or vintage clothing--I don't know which.  I love both.  3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be? Muckraking-giving the dirt...  4. ...ran a school, what would you teach? Aw, I got a job offer tonight to do just that---and science it is.  5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it? Rock--with classical influence.

      So I had my big interview today.  Since it had been the vice principal who had made the appointment with me I thought the interview was going to be solely with him.  To my suprise, and pleasure, the big principal joined us.  It is kind of hard doing a group interview when the two people interviewing you are not sitting next to each other.  I don't know if it was part of the test or something, but the big principal was sitting across the conference table from me, while the vice principal was sitting to my left.  I might add that this conference table was extra huge---I felt soooo far away from my interviewers.    Anyway--so it proceeded, and they asked me the normal classroom managment, previous lesson you have taught that was successful, and you are near the students age type questions.  Since this was my first big interview I was kind of a bit (LOT!) nervous--so some of it is a bit blurry now.  I think it went well though.  At the end of the interview they informed me that this week they would be making their decision and if I get the position (they have 3 available for the coming year in Life/Earth science) the county will let me know.  Anyway so now all I can do is cross my fingers.  I was sure however to get my thank-you notes out in the mail today since they are making their decision this week---got to make that last good impression.

      The job hunt continues.  Found a summer position I am interested in attaining. I emailed my resume as the ad called for, considering it is a resident advisor position for a boarding high school--and I was a college RA for four years I am hoping my chances are good.  Not to mention they also want a teacher type--which I happen to be.  The school is also looking for a science teacher for the fall-----could be interesting.  I haven't really considered working at a private school before, but I am keeping all options open.  Best part of it is that the school is in the city--right were I want to be in my dream world.  If I were to get the summer job it would be a nice test to see if the city is really were I want to live.  But the search still continues.....

      So I noticed that several several people do this Friday Fve bit.  So I thought I would get in on the action.  1. What was the last song you heard? Who Will Save Your Soul--Jewel.  Got home this evening and put in one of the "classics" from my CD collection.  2. What were the last two movies you saw? Starksy and Hutch--made me laugh so hard.  And you have to love that Owen Wilson.  3. What were the last three things you purchased? A 1000 grand bar, Real Simple magazine, and a milk.  All at the airport so you know that cost me an arm and a leg.  4. What four things do you need to do this weekend? Well--unpack the two suitcases of stuff I have brought home in my attempt to gradually move back from college.  I don't want to have a car load of stuff when I leave college in May.  Also--wait I am on spring break I don't have to do anything else....except maybe catch up with some friends.  5. Who are the last five people you talked to? My Mom and Dad, Some guy on the airplane who was returning from his spring break.  He went to sailing school in Key Largo--tough life eh?  The Stewardest (to tell her I wanted OJ). And my sister.

      I am now home in DC. Had to make a mad dash from school this afternoon to the airport to make my flight.  Tofore sday though, the last day before spring break was quite zany.  The kids were all abuz about getting to go on spring break--and wouldn't stay in their seats.  I taught about viruses and did an activity in which students can see the spread of a virus through body fluids.  To do this activity you give each student a test tube of "body fluid" (water) and a dropper.  They each then exchanged body fluids with 5 partners which they keep tract of on a "dance card".  The kicker is that one student started out with a test tube of water and a drop or two of NaOH (Sodium Hydroxide).  After they all trade body fluids they have to go to the "doctors office" and get tested for the "virus".  The "doctor" (teacher) then adds phenophalyen (spelling?) to each test tube to see which students contracted the virus from the others.  The students then use their "dance card" to figure out who the originator of the virus was.    In one of the classes 60% of the students ended up contracting the virus.  It really gave them some perspective on how things can spread.  Only one glitch in the lesson.  Today my mentor was out and a sub was there to babysit (laws of course say I as a practice teacher can't be there alone).  Anyway the sub saw fit to jump in and throw some sex ed buisness and advice in--I sat in silence since I had talked to my mentor previously about this.  She said she avoided the topic of sex ed because of previous experience with parents being mad over her not teaching solely abstinence====anyway the sub didn't say anything out of line---I just hope students didn't take their own interpretation of it home to their parents.....arh.

      Today was madness.  One day until Spring break and the kids are buck wild.  We had career day at school today, and since we couldn't get a speaker (long story) my mentor and I decided we would show some career related videos to the kids.  The videos were horrid and the kids hated them.  By the end of the day I was pretty sick of watching them myself.  Arh.  Hoping tomorrow goes more smoothly since it will just be me and the kids, and a sub.

      Had a student come in and make up a test today.   The student was mad because I made them make up the test on the third day of being back from a week of sickness (They really should have made it up by day 2).  They had been present all the class periods up until the test, and only missed two days of my class-the test day and new unit material day.  When they came to school monday I gave them notice that they needed to come into lunch to make up the test.  When they came in they wanted to make up the lab they missed--I said "NO"--the test comes first.  The grade made wasn't too hot.  When they got their interim in class, they said "I blame Miss K".  Arh.

      Two more days until spring break.  Things were starting to get a bit restless today, a classroom management nightmare.  By the end of that I wanted to cry because no one was listening to me.  They were just not listening.  Arh. After today I am kind of scared to see what Friday is going to be like.  My mentor teacher won't be there that day, she will be with a select group of students at a weekend conference---so it is basically like sending me into a pen of wolves---except it is really going to be just 3 classrooms of crazed pre-springbreak kids.    Lesson was sub par today---did a flower disection and just graded on performace rather than having them turn anything in.  Didn't want the papers to grade.  Also gave out interims which got me a few groans.  Tomorrow is career day, and that means a speaker in the class--so not much for me to do besides manage the classroom (as if that is not enough).  Today I felt like a babysitter for the first time.  Arh.  My lucky happy streak couldn't go on forever.   Went out and saw Starksky and Hutch tonight with friends--the comic relief was much needed.

      I had two kids get sick today, and I had to send them to the wellness center.  I hope I don't catch it--this would be the worst time to catch something considering that I have my first real adult job interview next week (I dont consider my previous jobs "adult" work).  Anyway so getting sick would be bad right about now.  My lesson went well today.  My days are so long that I almost forgot that I was observed today by my university advisor.  Anyway he said I did real well--only one more observation to go and I am home free.  My lesson for tomorrow was about to be a disaster, but my mentor teacher came through for me in revising it and we are going to disect daffodils from her yard.  She really is the best.

      Aside from the quiz--see below--I had a really good lesson today.  I really had to modify and adjust during first block because student council elections are coming up and we had to watch the video of a candidates.  When I heard we were supposed to watch this I figured it would be on for about 15 minutes---well 15 turned into 45. So that took half of my class time away.  I was able to get through my lecture--but the kids were really cut short on their lab.  We are going to have to pick up where they left off on Wed.  In the other classes I had left-over time---about 20 minutes in each class so I picked up the test I had made for this botany unit and decided to divid the class in two for some review time.  Making things a competitive game really works well and keeps them engaged until the bell rings. And they did pretty well on the questions.  The kids had no idea I was taking the questions for their upcoming test--so hopefully when they see the questions they will be able to make better connections with the material.  This is something I am definately going to do more often when I have left over time.

      Today I gave a pop quiz.  The kiddies were not to happy about it or me, which I guess is fair because I gave it to them because I wasn't too happy with them.  As part of their nightly homework they have vocabulary to define. This is the way my mentor teacher had done things all year long, and I saw fit to continue it.  Vocabulary is very important in science because students encounter many new words in each text page they read and in activities.  Students need to know the language of science in order to be successful.  Anyway my students hadn't been doing their vocabulary as regularly as they should. And as my teacher had been doing I would just check for it occasionally.  It is not possible to check it everyday---that would just be to much.  I have decided though when I have my own classroom my students will have a composition book which will become their science dictionary-----  Well on Thursday and Friday when I checked for vocabulary, only half had completed it in all classes (I was suprised that even only half of the last class had it done since they could have heard I was checking it through the grapevine).  The students always complain about when I check to vocabulary--saying that I never check it when they do it. I have to always remind them that they should always be doing the vocab, reading and a bit of study on their own. So today I decided that if they wanted to earn points (they are all about earning points) for doing vocabulary they would---by doing well on a pop quiz focused on the vocab.  If they had done---and by done I mean actually knew what they were copying down from the book (gasp if they actually put the definition into their own words!!!) and had maybe studied them again.  So I gave the quiz despite many moans.  And the hightest grade made was a 10 out of 12.  Most people however got 6 out of 12.  In a way this will be nice proof for me to give them that they are not studying enough---but it is also discouraging to me.  There is simply not enough time with block scheduling to do it all--students really have to put time in at home studying.  They are in 10th grade too--so they are not new to the block scheduling system.  How can I make them study more...without spoon feeding them???

      Took my last and final praxis today.  It was the Life Science Pedagogy test.  This test consists of a 3 part prompt in which you have to write unit objectives, lesson plans, and assesment techniques for a given topic.  This test is kind of a crap shoot of sorts as the topics can be any variety of things related to life science.  As an example on the praxis website they have a prompt in which you have to write a week long unit on Vertebrate Hearts.  In my opinion with all the frameworks we have to complete through the year you couldn't possibly spend a whole week on the vertebrate heart---but anyway.....  My prompt was better than the sample.  I had to write about the "Flow of Energy and other material cycles in ecosystems."  Before the test I was praying that I wouldn't get some off the wall subject that I wasn't confident in.  God answered my prayer.  I know Energy, Water, Nutrient, and Gas cycling pretty well.  In fact in my ecology course I did a semester long research project on nutrient cycling in lake ecosystems------so yeah I think I did well today.    I actually didn't need to pass this test to get my teaching license in Virginia, but I have to have it to graduate from my university (my university is not in Virginia).  So I have to pass it to graduate, but not to teach in the state I desired to teach in.  It is all part of my universities states scheme to get all graduates to stay within the state-----but that is another story all together.

      Okay, so this evening I had my first unexpected run-in with one of my students in public.  I was with a friend at the video store waiting in line and I noticed I new the back of the head in front of me.  I then called out the students name and he turned around "Hi Miss F!".  I then lean over to my friend and say "See all of my students are taller than me".  His mother then turns around (which I hadn't noticed before) and says "And they are all taller than their mothers".  At this point I don't take the opportunity I should have to introduce myself properly and tell her what a good student her son is (which I am sure she already knows).  They are then done checking out videos and leave the store.  I guess she didn't introduce herself either so maybe I shouldn't feel that bad.  But I was just so weirded out by having my students see me "out of the classroom".  I mean--I was with my best friend who was wearing a tee-shirt saying "I Love Bazooka(the gum)".  It is just something I am going to have to get used to.

      Some days feel so long, but overall the weeks past really fast.  I can almost not believe that I only have 5 weeks left before I am done student teaching.  My kids ask me everyday how much longer I will be around.  They claim to like me--but their asking makes me feel like they can't wait to get rid of me. For me though the experience so far has been nothing but stellar.  Got a letter in the mail today offering me a teaching position.  It was from a school district that I briefly talked to at the teacher fair last week.  I would not consider the conversation I had with the rep an interview by any means.  But I guess my certification is just that needed.  Anyway the salary is great---it is just not in the location I want to live in.  I have 60 days to reply--but I am pretty sure I will decline.  This does give me hope however for the interviews I have scheduled over spring break.  In one of my classes I moved some kids around today, hopefully to curtail some classroom managment issues that I have been having--we will see if it works.

      Today I administered my second test.  It went much smoother than the last test, and although I haven’t graded any of them yet, it seems that the students feel much better about this test than the last.  I removed the free response question because my mentor and I have been so busy grading the science research projects that we have no time for grading even another paragraph.  Hopefully this test will not have to be curved as much as the last one.  It is important for us to get all this graded though because if any student is failing we have to give them a failing interim before the report card.  I think that is almost to much pressure to put teachers under, but I suppose this is due to fussy parents.  I have come to find that many parents see their children through rose colored glasses and that they can do no wrong.    	Have discussed how the science projects have come out with my mentor.  She, as well as I are rather displeased with them.  It seems she had a good system of assigning it though, it is just that students did not put the time into it that they needed too.  So many of the reports are in first person, which is a big no-no in scientific writing.  Other projects were just way below grade level I thought.  We gave back the first of the grades today and we have many unhappy kids.  They apparently felt they did A work, but we gave them a C.  I guess they just didn’t rise to the occasion.  	I have come to realize recently that I come home happy everyday.  I have never had a job were I feel good about it all the time.  I am realistic however and know that one day will be really rough and that I will want to cry.  But it does give me a good outlook for teaching to be my career.  It is just very comfortable feeling, this job is.  	I spent a lot of time this past weekend planning my botany unit.  I even went as far as to make a graphic organizer.  So I had my student fill it out after they took their test, and they were totally clueless in what to do with it---I really wonder if they have ever been taught how to take notes.  Anyway they get to many details sometime and fail to see the big picture, which is what I was hoping the graphic organizer would do.  So in the next classes I explained what to do with the organizer—and it went a bit better.    	After school today we had a faculty meeting.  It was really long and tiring.  I never get head aches, but I really got one there.  Anyway I find that the teachers act towards the principal as the students act toward the teachers.  They would get excited over the silliest things and upset and unruly at times…it cracked me up.  The principal actually snapped at a teacher---very weird I thought.

      Today was a busy day.  When I got to school we picked the pictures I took at the science fair and got them edited to put on the webpage.  Then I taught 3 classes in a row, the last class before a test.  With block scheduling there is really no time to have a "review day", but I do hold review sessions at lunch anyday anyone shows up.  Today I did have a victory of sorts.  In one of my classes there is a student who is not achieving to what I see as the best of his ability.  Last Thursday I talked to this students as he was entering the classroom and told him that I hope to see him at lunch on Monday so that we could make sure he was prepared for the test.  Well sure enough he walked into the classroom at lunch time today---I have to say there was a bit of shock on my mentor teachers face at his presence.  I later told her that I invited him to come to lunch today, and she said she had been trying to get him to come in for extra help all year but hadn't.  I don't know what finally clicked with him, but I am sure glad it did.  He even said he would be in for more help tomorrow at lunch---yippie!  Well tomorrow is the second test.  Hopefully it will be more successful than the first.  Cross your fingers for me.

      Today I had to go take care of some buisness up at the university. I picked up my cap and gown, which makes graduation seem more tangable and real.  I also had to present my portfolio today, and it was rather painless.  Saw the other two people in the secondary science ed program--I am the only one with a job so far--one of them has decided not to go into teaching--and the other still has a class to take this summer so no one will hire her till she is completed it.   Aside from the school stuff I had the dentist and other before you move appointments to attend to.  Only one more meeting at the university on Thursday for all the interns.  Then my undergrad career will be over.  Oh yeah--I am in withdrawl from my kids.  I miss them so, I didn't realize how attached to them I have gotten.

      Today was the last day of my internship.  It was a really good day.  It started out with the most getto Indian ever rapping a rap he wrote in my honor.  He then gave it to me on paper--a sure keepsake.  Then the day proceeded and we had a party in each class.  Now I know why teachers never ate at the class parties--you can't possibly eat at them all--or you are sure to gain weight.      Well I am tired from my last day, and my friends are having a party for me tonight--if it doesn't rain out.  So I am off for a nap...

      Today was my first day of my last week of my internship.  My only real order of buisness this week is handing back and going over the test I gave last week.  Besides that I am kind of just sitting around.  I would much rather be doing something constructive.    The kids are acting really upset that I am leaving---which makes me feel good--but senioritis it hitting hard---and I can't wait to graduate!

      My last friday of my internship, as next thursday is my last day.  Gave the test to B day classes, two of the classes had very disappointing grades----in one class 10 of 18 made a D or F.  They are the lower of all the classes--very low compared to one period in which 10 of 22 made A's.  Big disparity there.  Makes me think there was some approach with them that I should have taken but didn't-----  Went and saw Connie and Carla this evening--very funny.  Saw some of my students at the theater---being with my friends and having a group of kids yell out "Hello Miss _____" is kind of interesting.  I am sure I will get used to it over time.

      I gave my last test to A day classes today.  It was a more challanging tests then those I have given before, I think that is good though.  I once had professor say that a test is bad if someone can make a 100 on it.  A good test should challenge all students.  If that is the case, this test was certainly challanging.  Of the ones I have graded thus far, the highest grade was a 93.    On all the past tests I have given the same free response question to all classes.  But after some classes passing on the final jeopardy question of my review game, I thought it would be interesting and necessary to change up the free response for each class.  In my room we have one of those white boards which has several boards which slide in front of and behind other boards.  My second and third period classes of the day had shocked looks on their faces when the question was not what they had heard threw the grapevine.    I guess you could say that test was my little gift before I left.  Speaking of leaving--I only have 5 more school days to go...

      Made a way cool review game, Jeopardy style on my computer.  Made funny catagory names and everything. Used the LCD to project it on the screen.  The kids LOVED it.  I think the best compliments were  1.  "Teacher--this is just like Saturday Night Live Jeopardy! So cool..." 2. "You are just like Will Farrell Teacher"  Don't they know Alex Trebek!?!  They did get something out of the review as well I am sure.

      Fortunately my school has a lot of diversity, along with this diversity comes a lot of interesting personalities.......some of my favorites from today:  1.  The Self dubbed Getto Indian--he believes himself to be the most getto guy from India around. I told him otherwise of my friend Ali from high school and he then asked if Ali was Muslim....so he then dubbed himself the Most Getto Hindu Indian around--he comes into class rapping everyday and cracks me up.  Today it was all about the rap competition he is entering tomorrow.  He definitely makes me smile.  Not only is he a good student, but when the rest of the class is talking, he shouts out "Your out of control guys"---today we did a earthworm dissection lab.  After they dissected the worm I assigned different groups body systems to go around and talk about.  As I was milling around the room I heard him describing the circulatory system in a native Indian accent, which he normally doesn't have.  When I inquired about his change his partner informed me that he uses that voice whenever there is a substitute teacher.  One time apparently the whole class was laughing about it and the sub got upset thinking the class was making fun of the accent and then tried to comfort him-----you got to give it to the kind for having a sense of humor.  2.  The Fashion Plate---I have never seen this girl wear the same thing twice.  Her closet must be never ending.    3.  The Siamese Twins--two best friends in the same class.  They do everything together including asking me if they can one day be my bridesmaids---???  I don't even have a boyfriend...crazy girls......  4.  The Boys with the Same Last name---I have two boys in class with the same last name.  Today they choose to work together dissecting the earthworm.  My mentor teacher was giving oral instructions on how to dissect the worm, but the boys went ahead and started dissecting from the anterior end *(opposed to the posterior end where they were supposed to start)---and cut to deep basically destroying their worm.  When my mentor saw it she said they were getting a zero for they day.  The boys got so upset, but not vocally upset.  They looked like little puppy dogs who had lost their toy.  They then asked if they could get a new worm, to which my mentor replied "No".  To the side my mentor and I discussed if they should get a new worm.  We determined they could and she sent me over to tell them.  I said "okay boys, you can get a new worm."  I might add at this point they were sitting at the lab desk with their heads hung in despair.  One of them looked up at me and said "Really?" in a voice similar to how Oliver Twist might has said "Please sir, may I have some more?"  It was just to cute--they were so excited we allowed them to get a new worm.  5. The Surgeon--very bright kid--never does his homework---skips a lot--does well on tests--has to maintain thug appearance---did the best dissection of a earthworm I have ever seen.  The boy has the hands of a surgeon for sure-----

      Today, it finally happened.  The first day I wanted to cry.  I handed back some lab drawings and some students wanted to dicker over the grade they got.  I reminded them that they would need to stay after class or come in at lunch to discuss such things with me, that at the moment it was my time and we were going to move on with class.  Well one particular student gave me a dirty look the whole class because I wouldn't listen to them at that moment.  After class the student came up to me, pushed several papers in front of my face and said "It's my time now" in a voice with attitude.  The student showed me their and two other students papers and wanted to know why she missed one more point than the others.  I explained it to her, but she was still not satisified with my answer.  I then told her, she was right--that the other students should have missed one more point as well and began to lower the other student's score.  She snatched the papers out of my hands, and walked out of the room saying "Your just plain crazy".    I am glad my students want to make good grades, but they often times expect to be GIVEN good grades.  There is little work ethic involved in my students--very disappointing considering how bright most of them are.

      I have been putting off doing my portfolio for some time now.  I just pulled out all the documents I have and I think it is going to come together pretty well.  Well--I have decided to hole myself up in my room until it is all done.  Ill write more after I have emerged.

      Today we did our first disection of the year, the roundworm Ascaris.  It went pretty well, no kids flinging guts everywhere or anything.  They seemed to enjoy it.  Only 2 1/2 more weeks---it is really winding down. I am going to miss the kids so....

      Went to the state science fair today (winners won't be announced till tomorrow) and had a fun time.  Most of the day was spent setting up and hanging around waiting until the judges came.  I am crossing my fingers for all my kids.  Some interesting things did happen though:  1.  A parent came up to me and gave me tons of praise.  Going on and on about how her daughter just loved me.  It was definately a feel good moment.  2.  I meet with my sister for lunch at the universities student center.  Some of my students were there eating--and they kept coming over one by one asking my sister "Who are you?".....and of course they all later told me that my younger sister looked much older than me.  3.  I was sitting by myself with a high school aged boy hit on me---and asked me which high school I was from--he was definately embarassed when I shared I was a teacher.  4.  My students--after they witnessed the hitting on by another high schooler, told me I should take steps to look older----one commented I should start smoking because it would give me wrinkle.  Man--my kids are smart.  5.  I felt like a high schooler all day walking around campus with my purse and a dress on.  When I went to school there, high school groups would be on campus occasionally for FBLA, Science Fair, etc...and we would always laugh at the girls who were all dressed up and carrying purses (trying to impress the college guys you know).    I knew that because I look my students age that the students on campus thought I was one of those girls---and they were laughing and moaning at my presence.  Arh.  In other news, the private school I sent my resume in for a summer job and a regular job finally got in touch with me--but they wanted to hire me immediately.  I said of course I wasn't available considering I am still in school.  They did say they would get in touch with me in a week or two about the summer resident advisor position for their dorms.....this summer is looking up.

      Today was April fools day, and I was prepared for the worst--at least I thought I was.  There were a few kids who thought they would be cute and say funny things.  "Miss _ will you marry me? April Fools" (I really didn't get that one).  But then it happened--the best prank.  I really have to give the student credit--because it had me scared.    We were doing a microscope lab.  And I was helping a lab group when I heard a CRASH.  My worst fears flashed through my mind that a microscope was mishandled and feel to the floor.  I turned around to find my student standing in fear, looking down at the ground.  He then bent over and picked something up from behind his lab table----it was a microscope.  I was still afraid of what damage had been done to it.  A single lens can get out of place or scratched--then came a burst of laughter from him and his lab group, followed by "April Fools".  The joke was especially good since my mentor had stepped out of the room, and I knew I had been the one in "control" of the classroom.  He then told me how did he the crash (by slamming down a chair)---I had to laugh and gave him some credit for pulling a good one.    It kind of made me happy that they felt they could pull a good joke on me, and that I was able to laugh at it.

       urlLink    I just love moving/organizing because you come across things you haven't seen in a while.  I found some great pictures when I was organizing my digital images into folders.  This picture was taken while I was visiting Switzerland.  It was a great weekend trip I took while I studied abroad in the Netherlands.  The views of the small villages from the train were breathtaking. I can't believe it has been 3 years.&nbsp; urlLink

      I haven't blogged in a few days.  Been spending time with family before my sister goes back to school for the summer.  I have also been taking time to do some planning.  Outlining a budget based on my future teachers salary, starting to look at what type of condo/townhouse Ill be able to get for my money, and buying a  urlLink dinning room table  for the future house I don't even have yet (you can't pass up a 20 table at the Crate and Barrel outlet).    Friday I went by my boss of last summer to visit, and he asked me to come back for the summer.  So on my days off from subbing and after the school year ends Ill work for him.  Since it is really only part-time work Ill try and do some tutoring to supliment an income.  Working for him will not only mean a short commute, lovely working conditions, good steady pay, no longer stressing about finding a summer job, but it will also leave me time to do some planning for fall.  Oh yeah--and the cicadas have come to my neighborhood now--and they are loud and alien sounding(at least how Hollywood portrays alien sounds because I really wouldn't know).

      Apparently two teacher found it important to show their high school classes video of the beheading of Berg. Below is from  urlLink Star-Telegram.com     Two Northwest High School teachers were suspended after they showed students a video of the decapitation of American Nick Berg in Iraq, Northwest district officials said Tuesday.  The teachers showed the video to three classes. One of the classes was confirmed to be a social studies class, they said.  Superintendent Keith Sockwell called the incident completely inappropriate. The two teachers have been placed on administrative leave. Any further disciplinary action will hinge on what the district's investigation reveals, officials said.

      I was bored and found myself looking through list of recently published blogger blogs.  Anyway I have been thinking of how to have my students be involved in a classroom blog next year (can I require participation, how many entries required, etc).  So I came across this one from an  urlLink AP English  class and found the students entries to be intriguing and thoughtful.  It really makes me hopeful for a successful blog next year.

      So I have talked about my plight of looking like one of my students before--but again my youthful looks have hit.  Today I went to get my TB test done so that I can start subbing for the rest of the school year at my future school.  Anyway I go and get the test done and afterward the lady is telling me not to wash the area or use lotion for 24 hours.  As she is describing this she marks two dots on one side of the test site. At this point I believe she is just going to put 4 dots around the perimeter she doesn't want me to wash.  Then it happens---she doesn't draw two more dots--she draws a mouth.  You can see it in the picture below.  I know I look young, but do I deserve child like medical treatments?

      I went to some estates sales today.  I really enjoy going to them to shop for jewelry and vintage clothes.  Now that I have graduated college and am looking to get my own place soon my focus is shifting to furniture and such.  Anyway so I spend many weekends this past semester going to estate sales.  Now that I am here in VA I had to check out what the scene was like here.  Prices are a bit higher, but the treasures are way better!    The first house I went to seemed more like a divorce sale than and estate sale in which someone died.  Way overpriced in my opinion.  The second sale was at a house which also served as a dental office (attached to one side).  I got some really neat old library style index card files draws which will act nicely in holding recipes etc. Also got some file trays for my classroom, nice and wood--should hold up better than any plastic ones I might find at a teacher supply store.  There were some really neat dental pieces for sale--but seeing the dental chair attached to the house was kind of creepy.    The third sale I went to ended up being the house of  urlLink Sonny Jurgenson .   There wasn't much there that interested me.  But you could buy his Redskins blazer for almost 400 dollars.   The house was huge though, and right on the water--I bet the property had to be worth a couple million.

      I got this great postcard at the museum today.  I think these are my new rules for dating.  The Moscow Rules:  1. Assume Nothing 2. Never go against your gut. 3. Everyone is potentially under opposition control. 4. Don't look back; you are never completely alone. 5.  Go with the flow, blend in. 6. Vary your pattern and stay within your cover. 7. Lull them into a sense of complacency. 8. Don't harass the opposition. 9. Pick the time and place for action. 10.  Keep your options open.

      Today my dad took a day off of work and we went into the city and checked out the  urlLink International Spy Museum .  It was pretty good even though it is one of the few museums in the city you have to pay for.  Some of the artifact were pretty cool, while some where disturbing (a rectal tool kit?!?). After the museum we had lunch then saw the movie  urlLink Van Helsing  .  It was good--though I can't seem to figure out if he was still in angel form or not--if yes, how could be become a wolfman?

      Today I had an interview for a summer position at the Universal Ballet Academy in DC.  The interview went really well I feel.  The only downside to the job is the commute—almost an hour by metro.  I have always wanted to be a metro girl, but—I don’t know if it is realistic.  I suppose it will depend on how much they are going to pay me.  I had a tour of the school, which has about 85 students.  The facilities are lovely, and should be considering students pay upwards of 20,000 to attend each year.  It sounds like it would be a really fun job, as I love working with the teenage set-----we will just have to see….

      So summer has begun and with it a new blogger.  The new blogger has a template that I really like so I thought that at least for a while I wouldn’t modify it.  I haven’t yet figured out just where on this template to add links, but when I do Ill get my links back up.      Since my graduation I took a road trip and saw some old friends.  This week is full of taking care of business.  Changing drivers license over to this state, opening new bank account, interview for summer job, etc.  Hopefully if I get the summer job at the boarding school for ballerinas I will have some interesting stories to tell.  Next Monday I will start subbing at my future high school, so that should provide me with some tales.

      Today I graduate from college.  Starting tomorrow I can no longer claim my occupation as "Student"---after being one formally my whole life it means a big change is ahead.  Now formally I will be a "teacher".   I will start subbing next week, after my roadtrip home to DC.  Then another summer job before I get my own classroom in the fall.  Perhaps I will have some subbing stories--but more that likely this blog will be slow through the summer.  Ill be back next year with stories of a first year teacher.  I am sure there will be much more drama than my student teaching experience.  Ill really get to feel the politics of working in a school--and Ill have 150 new personalities to get to know and adore. Cheers to all, and thanks for reading, advising, and giving support.

      Been spending the past few weeks busy with shopping for the new house.  I close on the house Wednesday--which is very exciting.  I never thought I could get tired of shopping--and ladies, I am not saying I am--but it is getting nearly close to that point.  Anyway---pictures of the house coming Wednesday.  Until there here are more pictures of  urlLink Gretchen's Wedding

      Today I went and subbed at the school Ill be working at next year.  Since it is finals week, and apparently every student is somehow exempt from the exam I was subbing for, they just watched a movie.  So it was some easy, gloirfied babysitting.   I did get to chat with the principal, as well as meet my science department team at lunch.  Many of them gave me very helpful information to get me ready for next year.  I think I am really going to enjoy working with them.  One teacher did jokingly say to another--"I thought I said not to hire anymore 12 year olds"---Ill take that in jest for now.

      If you have been reading my blog for a while you may know that I am working at a real estate office for the summer, until I start teaching "for real" in the fall.  Working at the office is nice for so many reasons, but it has the side benefit that I get to look at listings for houses when they are fresh on the market--and I am looking for a place to buy.  Monday I went to work after a vacay away.  I took a quick look at the listings in the location and price range I am looking at---and one caught my eye. I talked to my realtor about it--and he instantly knew it was something worth looking at.  So I had a look at it this morning and after seeing how fabulous and perfect it was for me, I put a bid in on it.  Apparently the owner's realtor said she was getting another offer today as well-so I am crossing my fingers that it works out.  The realtor is meeting with the owner in 30 minutes--so Ill find out tomorrow morning if I am going to be the home owner or not.  Very excited!    In other news I finally got called to sub today--of course the day I had an appointment to see a house.  Yesterday I finally talked to the lady at my future high school who is in charge of subs.  Come to find out that she is the mother of a high school friend (for those of you who don't know I am going to be teaching at the high school I graduated from--something I would have never imagined--but it just worked out that way). Anyway I think I really got on her good side--which I hear is pretty important as a teacher in getting a good sub to cover your classroom.  And hopefully she will be calling me for the remainder of the school year (till next friday).

      I am currently loving a Japanese candy called Pocky. I especially love the classic chocolate variety--I think they would make swell swizzle sticks in chocolate martinis.   Apparently I am:    urlLink       what flavor pocky are you?    urlLink  [c] sugardew       It sounds just about right I think.  If you didn't catch it in the entry below I am taking an hiatus from the educational talk and using this blog to just communicate personal thoughts etc.

      Here is an interesting new science magazine.&nbsp; Apparently it is the new, hip, "sexy" (according to the press page on their website) science mag.&nbsp; I found the article on Mercury in vaccines &nbsp;interesting---so I ordered me up a subscription (the first issue is free, and if it totally reaks I can cancel with no fee).&nbsp; Anyway--perhaps some of you may enjoy it as well.  &nbsp;

      So things are a bit busy here.  Tuesday I had my new teacher orientation meeting.  I went in and signed my REAL contract, got my ID badge, registered for my benefits, and watched all those fun safety videos.  One other person at the orientation will be at my school and in my department, so it was a good opportunity to get to know her a bit.  So now I don't have any teacher responsibilities till August 25 when the new teacher orientation begins. I would like to do some planning for the year---and I have done some---but I don't have a text book because they are getting new ones---I am just not getting as ahead as I would like I suppose.

      School districts really need to get on the ball.  I am not trying to toot my own horn, but school districts really need to react faster if they want to get quality people.  Back in Feb, before my spring break, I sent out a dozen or more resumes to schools.  I did this in hopes that when I came for spring break I would have several interview lined up.   Anyway so I finally get an email yesterday from a school district wanting to interview me tomorrow.  I understand that some schools can't asses their needs until this point in the year---but hey--in this market people (especially fully qualified in science) are going to go fast.   Anyway it worked out well for me----over spring break I had the interview, got the job--and now have a wonderful house less than a mile from my school.  It is all in place for me-----
