      This is my training schedule as of today.  I've been doing this for a while now, gradually working up my running distance and time in the saddle so I feel good about completing (and in fair standing) the SC 1/2 Ironman in mid-September 2004.  Monday Run 10 miles Circuit training at YMCA or at home on Bowflex for about an hour.  Tuesday Swim 2,500-3,000m Bike 20-30 if decent out  Wednesday Run 10 miles Circuit training at YMCA or at home on Bowflex for about an hour.  Thursday Swim 2,500-3,000m Bike 20-30 if decent out  Friday Run 10 miles Circuit training at YMCA or at home on Bowflex for about an hour.  Saturday Bike 30-45 miles  Sunday Active Rest  It seems like a lot and not too well organized into actual training.  This is too true.  If I miss a day, I don't sweat it.  Sometimes I may run, bike, or swim a little more or a little less.  It depends on how I feel and the weather and how much time I can spend away from the family and still have peace at home.  Train hard.

      So I just discovered this blogging thing - yes, I'm behind the times a bit. I will try to post religeously but typically have little stick-to power on such things.  Maybe this will be different - I don't know.  At any rate, I hope to post here about my triathlon training until and maybe through the 2005 Florida Ironman.  We'll see...  Good blogging.

      Okay.&nbsp; I signed up for Ironman USA yesterday.&nbsp; I was nervous about it, just pressing the button to confirm made me twitchy!&nbsp; But, it is done now.&nbsp; Only 361 days left to train...aaarrrggghhh!  So I ran today.&nbsp; I felt terrible but made it through.&nbsp; I think I'm just too damned tired.&nbsp; I'm taking off a couple of days and going to catch up on some sleepy.

      Great ride on Saturday.&nbsp; A small group busted off the main pack and headed out for an extra 25 miles (for 50 total) at a great pace.&nbsp; I felt Lance-like at times riding in a decent paceline.

      Thursday, I got in a good, fast ride with some dudes at work.&nbsp; We rode on an unclompleted and unopened section of new highway loop.&nbsp; Unfortunately, about 10 miles in to it we got harassed by the man - yes the police came and told us to get off the highway.&nbsp; We were too "small" to ride on this unfinished section of road and we could sue the state if we got hurt.&nbsp; Okay...that makes perfect sense.  At any rate, a couple of us shot off after that and paced around 20-22 for another 15 miles or so for a total of 30 @ 19.1 average.&nbsp; No too bad.&nbsp; We've made it a deal to try to ride every Wednesday out of work - just looking for a course now to get in 30 or more.

      Well the Ironman-distance swim at Mountain Island Lake was a good course.&nbsp; The water was nearly 90F and there was a decent current because we were not in a protected cove but in the channel.&nbsp; My time was decent 1:12.13, but not good enought to place me in my age group - which shall remain nameless&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I rested on Sunday and spent a lot of time this week at the gym doing weight training.&nbsp; I have also suggested to a co-worker and training partner that we sign up for Ironman USA vs. Ironman Florida.&nbsp; It is in a better time of year for us - summer vs. winter.&nbsp; It is also a tough-looking Ironman course, chock full of hills!

      Wednesday, I ordered a new bike.  I am pretty psyched about it - although it is setting me back some coin.  I ordered a Serotta Concours CS.  It is all Ti with carbon fiber seat stays.  I also dove in for some custom paint - I chose a fade scheme (top to bottom) in Sapphire blue to Sunset (orange-red)with yellow "Serotta" decals on the tubes.  If I can cut the pic from the CAD I will.  I think I am going with Campy gruppo - likely the Chorus carbon, Bontrager Race X Lite wheelset, Selle Italia Prolink Ti Gel saddle with carbon Bontrager post.  I have not looked at stems yet but will go with a zero degree rise or very slight since the bike is custom.  More to come and pix if possible.

       urlLink tri_fish  Okay, it is a little catch up time here. This week on Saturday I biked 45 miles as part of the Y2Y ride out of Lake Norman.  Rested Sunday. Monday I ran 4 miles and circuit trained. On Tuesday, I swam 3,500m. On Wednesday, I ran an hour and circuit trained.  I also ordered my new bike; a Serotta custom bike.  I will post seperately on that. Today is Thursday and I will swim 2,000m.  This Saturday, I have an Ironman open water swim (2.4 miles) as the second leg of the Dammed Catawba River Challenge.  My last time was 1:07.28 and I hope to better that.
