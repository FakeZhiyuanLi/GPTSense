      Even though they were created from man's own rib, women are an entirely different species and should be dealt with accordingly.  They act very different from guys, and if you’re a dork that has happened to have stumbled upon this post, I tried to come up with some useful advice when dealing with the ladies:  1)  Act Casual, Be Yourself  When talking to a girl you like, it is most important to act casual and  not be nervous .  Talk to her in the same way you talk to your friends after a wicked intense game of FFXI.  As the conversation progresses, you should be getting a vibe of whether the girl likes you or not.  If you feel that you’ve fallen into the friend zone, don’t push things or it will make your relationship awkward.  If you think you might have a chance, go in for the kill - but if she doesn’t like you, don’t panic, shrug it off, and casually change the subject. (Remember my friend; liking girls is a lot like having a batting average in baseball, if you can "bat" .300 you’re doing pretty well.  Everyone strikes out every once in a while, and when you do, suck up your pride and carry on.)  2)  Don’t be cocky/arrogant/egotistical  No one likes an asshole, and very few women respond well to guys who act all cocky because  they aren’t very sure of themselves.  These are the guys who are always putting everyone down, that constantly make snide remarks, and are always looking to one up their other male friends.  There is a fine line between cocky and confident.  Women like confidence, but cockiness is like cancer - one you get it, it will lead to your demise.   3)  Be honest, Have fun  - As Mark Twain once said "Honesty is the best policy." The more that you’re honest with the lady the more trust can be built, which is the key in the foundation of a strong relationship. One thing for sure to do at all times - no matter if you’re dating the girl you like or not - is to  be honest with her . Yeah this is going to sound really gay, but girls like to know how you’re feeling and what you think about the relationship.  Enough sappy talk, its time to talk about having fun.  Being in a relationship can be a lot of fun, as getting to know your new lover is always an interesting experience. (And I didn’t mean that sexually)  Experiences with different people can have completely opposite outcomes and this is what drives the man to date around.  A leave thee with these parting remarks, have fun with the lady friend, you’ve worked hard to obtain her.    **Important side note:  If you find yourself dating a girl that you don’t 100% like or find yourself attracted to another women, dump her. (There is never any use in misleading someone)    P.S.  - If you say you’re going to call, then call......you don’t know how many girls you’ve left hanging with the line "Ok, ill call you later!"

      On the first day of summer my true love gave to me...............David Chappelle on DVD.   Perhaps the funniest and blackest person ive ever listened to, David Chappelle entertains all races with his off-color remarks (no pun intend, seeing that most of his jokes deal with something racist, which you probably know unless youve been living under a rock for the past couple of months).  His ingenious ideas have sparked a revolution in suburbia, with the phrase "Im Rick James, Biatch!" being slung around by every white kid i know. (And in Highland Park, thats alot of white kids).  Of course it is butchered severly in most cases, but never fails to be funny.  But this brings up a strong point-a point every imitator of The Black White Supremicist should know- please dont overuse his clever annecdotes.  When he says the joke its funny, when a pimply faced white kid says the phrase its awkward.  Im not saying never use his material, and if the proper timing comes up to yell "Fuck your couch nigga!" be my guest and holler with all your might.  Timing is key, and reminding someone of a Chappelle show skit you saw the other day to save a consersation is not acceptable.  My departing words are to use responsibly, and forever remember this time where David Chappelle was the comedy King.    PS -  This is for me (sip) and this is for my homies (pour out onto the ground)
