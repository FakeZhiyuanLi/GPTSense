      Today was one of those days you don't really find often. It started out simple enough with me awaking after a night of fitful sleep at sometime around 3:00 in the afternoon. Oh yes I sleep with the best of them. I can turn an 8 hour sleep into 14 without even turning over. I filed through my tasks, such as laundry and errands and then I prepared for the Maroon 5/John Mayer concert that was at 7:00. I am in love with Maroon 5. I went with a very good friend of mine and we had so much fun. But it was the car ride home that was the most interesting. We decided on that hour and twenty minute trip that we were going to plan for everything. I mean everything. We decided then and there that we were going to be a writer director team and make movies. I, being the writer out of the two, was naturally the script writer, and she being the more commanding was to be the director. And damn if we didn't work. We decided on horror because it was our favorite genre. And I clicked out a couple different storylines in about 30 minutes time. I never realized how many times a day I would think "that would be a good movie" and "wow that would be really scary", but I never thought I could turn it into anything. But now it seems our planning has allowed me to being with it. This adventure of ours could turn into nothing, but then again it could turn into everything. So as of now I have started my hand at script writing, and she has changed two college course electives into directing courses. This was a day that I might remember forever as the day I decided to become what my destiny wanted me to be or this could be a day that meant nothing in my course of life, but I do hope it is the latter of the two.

      Hello. My name is Sara for those of you who do not know me. And what follows is a small description of my origins. I am seventeen, an age which has been rather perplexing because I can now see R rated movies without being carded but it seemed the second I could prove to them my age, they no longer cared to know it. I live in a place I would rather not. And I have a life I would rather not have. I am not saying its a terrible thing, for it isn't. My family has all the necessities and a long way beyond those. But my life is a doldrum of tasks and routines. Nothing exciting ever happens. Anyway, I am part English and part Scandinavian and I chose the name Britishgal because I can do a rather convincing english accent (plus I was able to trick a close friend into truly believing that I was really a full blooded English women who put on an American accent just to fit in. She promised she would never share my secret and I let her believe it for a couple months after). I have three dogs, one of which I am sure is plotting my slow demise because he is very sneaky and I have found him numerous times peaking around corners to stare at me. I have a horse as well, which I love dearly but I think the only reason she likes me is because I carry carrots in my pocket. I also have a cat. He is my favorite of our animals and I know I shouldn't have favorites, but I cant help it. He is named Lestat, after the Vampire Lestat in the classic Ann Rice novels and also after the character that Tom Cruise played in Interview With the Vampire. We have named him this because of his nature to kill most everything that crosses his path. But he is the sweetest cat I have ever met when it comes to humans. The instant he lays eyes on me he begins to purr. I play golf and I don't know why. The sport is by far the most boring thing I have played ever and it only adds the increasing number of things in my life that never change. Every time I go to practice it is all the same. We go out hit a ball towards a hole in the ground some hundreds of yards away. I started because it was something I could do with my father that no one else could and it slowly got out of hand until I cannot get out of it. My parents expect me to get a college scholarship out of it. I don't think I could last another four years of it really. I enjoy the Ocean. I even enjoy the sand that gets everywhere. I like the smell of it and the thought that just over it is an entire other world that is looking at us thinking the same thing. I can surf but not as well as I would like. But practice can diminish that thought. I also like the City. No I guess not like, Love. I do not live in one and it is the one thing I have to look forward to. I look forward to being lost in its endless skyscrapers. I look forward to the exciting jostle of its streets. My favorite City would have to be London, though I have not visited them all yet so my decision may change. I don't know why I like them so much, but it is all I really have. Anyway, that is me. Boring old me whose life is based on trips to cities. In this blog I will tell you about what happened to me that day and what I am thinking. This all started because it is easier to write down what I am feeling then to have them heard by another human who is probably thinking about ways they can leave the conversation. If you chose to read it you may, but I don't know why you would. This is something for me to use to get rid of everything the day brings.
