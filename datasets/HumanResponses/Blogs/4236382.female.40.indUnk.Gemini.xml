         Hello,   I am a 40 year old woman that was diagnosised with LD as a second grader and then in my 20's diagnosised with ADHD. I live in a house alone with my cat. I have had a daycare and just recently closed due to lack of kids enrolled.    I years ago made mistakes when I was younger and not mature and responsible as much as I am now and wrote some bad checks and got scared. Yeah so we all make mistakes and with learning and being taught people can change. Well my family didn't teach me they said they tried they never sat down and taught me how to do alot of things and teach me alot of things I needed to know. They was busy with working, and other stuff never had time to sit down with me and help me. Well when I wrote those bad checks they didn't help me learn they took control of my $ and made it so now I am irresponsible the rest of my life and they have their darn noses in my life almost all aspects. I live in a house owned by mom but my sister has control of my $ so she controls alot of what goes on with the bills and what I do in the house.    I am dating a wonderful fellow and he has gotten me to now for once stand up for myself and my self -esteem is so much better. The treatment of the family has lowered myself esteem and they think I can't do anything or can't do anything good enough just because of my ADHD and LD I guess. Well I have news for them. I am working to get my Social Security and once I get $ I am going to paint the inside of the house like I want NOT like they want. I am the one that lives here NOT them!   I had impressions of my teeth made and backed out due to a close to getting a job. Well I decided to do the teeth and they said they won't hire me due to I won't start immediately. I need the job and $ so badly. I am now close to getting another job finally after 2 monthes of searching again and I am NOT missing this one up. I will wait for the teeth and see if I get the job. Well family is pissed and now have taken all my $ for gas, food away from me that I get from Social Secuity. I have enough food till Monday then that is it. I have barely enough gas to get somewhere if I am lucky around here right now thanks to them too. I will be ok I am keeping positive and have alot of ideas to get control of my $ and get my life back and inventing a new responsible me and show I have abilities and more of them than disabilities. I will get work and when they let me have time off I will get the teeth done once. I will have $ for food and gas and stuff while I am off a week or so.   I have turned this crisis into good though the living room furniture has been totally re-arranged and I have once a spare bedroom too. I am so excited for this. I will be getting a new mattress and springs Wed if all goes well for my room. I feel like a human and feel proud of the house again. It is clean and getting it totally organized. Turning bad into good. Well I will close for now. Keep the chin up and turn bad into good when things are rough makes it alot easier to deal with!  I will keep you up to date on the new in-vention I am going to work on losing weight and just building a new me completely and building a self esteem and being independent and happy no matter what family or others think! I believe in me and I will be ok no matter what!                                      Scatterbrain2004
