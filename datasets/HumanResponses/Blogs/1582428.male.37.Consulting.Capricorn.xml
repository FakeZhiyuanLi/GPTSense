      so I did it -- I went to an OA meeting -- this is the first time I have gone in 3 months and it felt REALLY right...... I didn't say a word except to introduce myself as we went around the room but I am glad I went.......and today I start again with Step 1 .. I AM POWERLESS when it comes to food.......

      some other small subtle changes .... really it's not complex or difficult to DO .... what's challenging is getting past the process of thinking about it.... it's so very tempting to analyze, think, re-think, re-analyze and wallow in your current existence... change seems so VERY hard, when in fact the promise that lies just on the other side of that change is so so much better than where I am now.....  just for today..... I will exercise when I get home from work.....   just for today .... I will begin my food journal.....   the past is gone.... and I need to be the change

      why would God allow these feelings & thoughts fill me if something weren't missing?  those "empty" feelings are rooted in childhood something you didnt get as a child it's therapy 101 i think  once you figure it out, and work through any negative feelings toward your parents or whatever ... then you can look at what you DO have and feel fulfilled (that's my take on it anyhow)  as an adult, i felt so happy when xxxx was born, and then after yyyy. like my life was shaping into what i wanted....everything centered around the kids. but now, i am craving things for me, yet somehow that leaves me feeling empty. i am not sure the hows or whys, or what i need to do to make things better in myself  a common thread for you AND me is that we never were on our own..... when we were young....no time to build or mold what WE are.....   and we have become something, but it feels as if circumstances have molded US........ like something has HAPPENED TO us.....rather than us MAKING something happen  when the truth...... the root......is that we made choices..... whether we were concious of them, or ready to make them or not......we made them.....  so in reality......we made what we are today but NOW we are VERY aware of our choices....... and want to pay attention to our SELVES perhaps for the very first time in our lives  and for some reason we have guilt about that.....when really it's ok   when really it's impossible to take care of someone else.....if we do not take care of ourselves too  ***************

      so I am travelling again..... being on the road makes it VERY challenging to eat right, always eating in resataurants and no direct control over ingredients nor portions -- however, so far I think I am doing ok ...... I am trying to eat what I normally would for breakfast and lunch.... I did have an indulgent dinner, but I ate mindfully....... also I am getting some exercise in the hotel gym..... one more day here and then back home.......  so my plan is to eat right.....and then work out just a little bit harder this weekend....  I also will try and go to a meeting on the weekend, since I missed what I hope becomes my regular meeting

      so my f-i-l was in town this weekend, a birthday celebration and then joined also by the m-i-l on sunday -- she always brings tons and tons of food... earlier in the day I had turned down ice cream knowing more food would be coming... I slipped a little and had some chips with a cheese dip, but then did avoid a bun with my hamburger at dinner.... all in all not a horrible weekend eating-wise.......  just for today -- I will turn over any indecision on eating to God  just for today -- I am going to not drink any soda, diet or otherwise, I suspect that the nutra-sweet isn't all that great for me anyhow
