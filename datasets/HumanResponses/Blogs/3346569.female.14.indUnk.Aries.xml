      i think that i have finally moved on. i think that i can just see past the one that i have liked so long n fine someone new. its going to be hard but ill find a way to get over it. ill find a way not to cry any more and ill find a way not to think about him anymore. i can finally sleep and not have those restless nites of stayin up to late thinking about him. she can have him now because its no use for me to like him anymore. GOD Y HAVE I LIKED HIM FOR SO LONG??? I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND!!! why did i fall head over heels for him. i knew i should have listened to her when she said he wasnt good enough for me.i should have listened to everyone who told me he wasnt good enough for me. but did i listen?? NO!!! OF COURSE NOT!!! i dont listin to anyone. and i got hurt because i didnt. god why does this have to happen to me?? why do i fall for someone who only talks to me because he wants some from my best friend??? WHY WHY WHY???? i guess its just the many questions in life that will never be answered. but i know now that i must move on n get over that one person. because once i do i know that i will feel like a new and better person. hey courtney~if you ever need me u know im alwayz here. im just one call away. n if i dont answer its because i may need your help at the time. n dont forget that that butthole doesnt deserve you because u can do sooo much better!! its gonna b hard to move on i kno. believe me i kno!!!! i luv ya sooo much!!! xoxoxoxoxo!!! sara~hey girl!!i luv you sooo much n ill alwayz b there for u like uv been here for me. weve been through everthing together n i hope our friendship lasts forever!!! megan~hey gurl!!! ur the greatest n ill alwayz b here for u if eva u need me!! n u know that for a fact!! i luv ya so much!!!! dont eva change n b tha best person you can be!!! ~!*PoEmS*!~ everything changes and nothings the same but as we grow up one thing does remain i was with you before and will be till the end 'cause nothing on earth could replace my BEST FRIEND!!  once upon a time it happened to me the sweetest thing that could ever be it was a fantasy, a dream come true it was the day i met you!!  this time its over im keepin my heart im gonna be strong and not fall apart it'll be better i'll not want to cry in a couple of weeks i wont want to die i wont want to go back ill be able to sleep it wont hurt so bad and i wont feel so deep!!  theres so many things i could say to you most of them you may already know you have made me a better person its like you have a piece of my soul every morning i wake up  all im thinking of is you thinking of what your doing and if your thinking of me too you make me so happy with just the things you say or the way you hold my hand and tell me its ok i cant picture being without you i just love you to much to let you go no matter what happens you'll always have that part of my soul!!
