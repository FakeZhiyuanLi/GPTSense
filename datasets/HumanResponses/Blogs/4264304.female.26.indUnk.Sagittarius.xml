						   At the behest of a good friend, I've created a blog. I figure, this be the perfect place to spill the random thoughts that fill my head. So, where to begin?  I am a single mom, and have been seriously single for over a year. I have a terrible history as far as relationships are concerned. Starting from way back at 14. Yeah, I dated a guy that was 10 years older then me. Actually took him from his long term girlfriend. We did a show together, he was the sound guy and lights guy. Local theater, you don't need more then one person manning the station. To Gillian on her 37th birthday. I was the daughter, Rachel. I made people cry. I think it was that play that made it evident that I could act my way outta anything I wanted by faking it. Anyhow, but yes, the light guy was my way of testing just how much appeal I had. Through the light guy I learned that just because you wanted it, doesn't mean it's good for you. Because I was young, he took advantage of the fact that I was just learning what relationships were. He was also very jealous, of everything. My friends, the guy that lived next door... He went as far as telling me that I couldn't audition for the next show cuz there was a guy in it that was closer to my age. It was a sick twisted relationship, that ended very shortly after it began. He even tried to pass off poetry that had been published, as his own. I don't miss him, but I learned a lot.  Then I met Christine. She was undoubtedly the most beautiful girl I have ever met. And will remain the most precious thing in my life. Her beauty forever captured in her final casket at a lovely 17 years of age. Ok... Here's the way I figured out I was more gay then I wanted anyone to know.  Chris was in my freshman year English class as well as my drama class. At the first moment, she and I became fast friends. We would make it a point to do all of our projects together, hang out after school, and sleep over at each others houses on the week ends. Then there was the fateful night when I discovered I was in love with her. We were watching some bad B rated movie on a Saturday night, and she went to change into Pj's. She asked if I wanted to come get changed too, and I was all about it. It was late, and I was tired. So we went to her room, and she shut the door. I remember watching her change, and how the lines of her body were crisp and clean. She was thin, and her background was American Indian mixed with polish. Strange combo I know, but her skin was perfect. Slightly tan year round, and soft as anything I've ever touched. Her long black hair seemed to cascade in a waterfall of shiny light around her shoulders. I remember watching her change, memorizing every inch of her. To this day I can still smell her, if I think hard enough. And then it happened. She looked at me with those huge black eyes, and said, "I've been thinking about you too." I didn't know what to say and was completely embarrassed that she caught me watching her. But then she kissed me. And life as I knew it ended. From that point on, our relationship blossomed into more then I'd ever though I could have. She and I were inseparable. We had our secret moments when we had slumber parties, and no one was the wiser. I did date a "guy" at some point, just to cover up some things, as well as Chris did. I never knew love could be like that.  So, two years go by, and we've been together the entire time. I'm now 16 and she just turned 17. Our bodies bloomed into lovely young women. Chris and I enjoyed every inch of each other, the taste the smell... The feel of having two people become one in a moment of love. At about this time we started doing some pretty heavy partying. Another friend of mine had introduced us to ex, and pot and Oh yeah.. K. For those not familiar with K it's Ketamine, which is a horse tranquilizer. It makes you drunk and high and motionless at the same time. Some people use it as a date rape kinda thing. SO... Chris and I decide to head to a party. July 7th, 1995. It was hot, she rode her Motorcycle and I came up later to the party. I got there, and man there were a ton of people. I looked for Chris, who people had said was really fucked up. I wanted to make sure she was ok. Well, when I found her... Can I just say that it felt like my soul had been ripped from my body. She was naked, and standing up with a guy named Mike behind her, inside her, and her mouth was around Eric. She looked at me, tried to say something, but was to fucked up to make much sense. I ran from the house, got in my car and drove home. My cell phone rang twice, it was her. The message she left was that she was going to come to my house, so we could talk. That I should wait for her. I'm still waiting it seems, because she never made it to my house. There's a road in this town that has a really nasty curve in it. Royce. All I know is that I got a call from the PD asking if I knew Christine, and that I should call her family. See, all she had on her was an ID bracelet that had her's and my name on it. In her back pocket was my school ID. So I called her Mother, and we went to the ER. They made me wait outside in the lobby when they told her mother she was dead. I heard her scream, and I passed out. When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed. Mrs. L was crying and holding onto my arm. It was surreal. I didn't believe what they said. Then Mrs. L asked if I wanted to look at her once more. I didn't understand what was happening. So we went, and I vomited when I saw her. Her perfect skin was ruined by the gravel on the road. Her hair was a mess of tangles ond knots. I wanted to touch her, make sure it was her. Then I got sick again. And they made me leave.  I locked myself in my room for days. I did not go to the funeral, as it was my fault she was dead in the first place. If I had only stayed at that house. If I had only made her stop what she was doing. If I only knew that I'd never be able to say I love you one more time. That was the first time I tried to kill myself. There's a song by the Cars, it was her favorite, and everytime I hear it... I cry. Who's gonna take you home, tonight? I miss her. She's tainted every relationship since. I can't love the way I loved her. And have a hard time getting close to women now because of it. Maybe one day the pain will cease. Maybe oneday I'll have that sollace I long for. But until then, I secretly miss her, long for her skin, smell her on the air. For those who know me, leave me alone on June 20th, that's her birthday, and I spend the day at her grave.  So... that's enough for now. I'm exhausted. I've not written this down ever. It's amazing that after 10 years, the pain is still so new.
