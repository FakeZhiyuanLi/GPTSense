       Well this is the first time i used this thing. i have a live journal but i get lost with it so i find this one much easier to use...i think.At least i can choose my font style! Thank god! Anyways not much has been happening. Just alot of school work and so on. bloody school work. I bought 2 books. 1 of them is called illuminated manuscripts-its about the art during the middle ages i guess i found it interesting, and the other book is called Enochian Magick - im in love with anything Enochian. Thanks to Seb for that because he introduced me to it. Its abit confusing though coz there are 4 Watchtowers for the elements yet they have it in Enochian language i kind of know some of the words but when you have a look at it - doesnt really make sense to why they have it there. Anyway i bought some fabric for my pants for fashion design. Im going to put these little butterflies on it and i got lips but im not sure where im going to put them at the moment. I have this blue laungerai (dont know how to spell it!) kind of fabric im going to put it at the bottom but my mum says i should make a belt. I just want them to look different since almost eery girl wears em and im sick of looking at them! Well i must head off. Homework to finish and sleep to catch up with! CYA!

        I have been neglectingthis for a long time now. Dont know why. Not much has happened. I watched Secret Window and The Butterfly Effect yesterday. My sister kept giving me kissy noises when John Patrick Amedori came on. (yes i know his name only to put it on here sheesh!) Shes such a moron...anyway i  am now known as Billpat. My friend and i were pretending to be Patsy and Eddie from Absoloutly fabolous(so upset its now off) and i was Patsy. Then we were like ok i want to be Bill from Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. So she is known as Teddie (Ted + Eddie = Teddie) and i am known as Billpat (Bill + Patsy = Billpat) yes its lame but its something we look into. Teehee...i guess you could call us mroons but meh! Must go now my ever shitting-me-kill-me sister is about to open the door and yell at me for being on this dam computer and argue some more about my homework and so on...even though i have done it!! SHEESH!! Nighty Night!
