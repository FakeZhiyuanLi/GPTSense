       Bonjour! I know that my blogs are boring, but I have NOTHING interesting to write about. Well, I have read quite a few books over the week... I read Awake and Dreaming (by Kit Pearson), The Daring Game (also by K.P), The Great Gilly Hopkins, and I just finished The Sky is Falling. I do a LOT of reading, since we don't have a T.V. When I am not reading, I am on the internet, studying, or helping my mom. My cousin, Sahithi and her family are going to come on August 15th, so life might get exciting again! So....  AU REVOIR!!!

       Hello! Guess what? we went to port elgin with my cousin from detroit and we had soo much fun there! we went to the beach, and there were humongous waves, and we were crashing through them! but my cousin had to leave the next day, but we were gonna stay there for another week. So, on tuesday my brother and I went to see the movie "Signs". The rest of the week went by, on thursday we went to a restaurant called "Jangles"! Then, when we were coming back to toronto, I begged my parents to take me to one of the many farms we passed by, so that I can actually see a horse up close. I guess i was lucky that day, because not only did my parents take me into a farm, but the farm owners were walking their 2 horses after giving them a bath. they were brown horses with a patch of white on their muzzles. One was a 3 year old boy named Scat, and the other was a 4 year old girl named Willow! They were magnificent!!! That was the end of my trip to Port Elgin!! c ya!

       Hi! Guess what????? I went to camp last week! Camp Wenonah was the best trip I've ever been to!(other than our india trip last summer) It was extremely fun! We stayes there for 3 nights, with our friends, in bunk beds (i got the top one), and our cabin was called ELM! The ppl in my cabin were nousheen, catherine, kim, teresa, teriann, aditi, tracy, and jana. when we got there in the afternoon, we ate lunch, and the instructors intoduced themselves.... there was john (nickname- GORDY!), Mellisa (Alice in Wonderland!), Matt (Matty cake!), Bootsy, Simon, and Derek! Then, we went to our first activities..Canoeing! Too bad though, just as we were getting into the canoes, there was ligtning and huge thunder. So, we had to play other games till later. Before dinner, everyone was hanging on the deck, attached to the eating lodge, well anyway, everyone was talking when suddenly i hear a ear-splitting crack, i jerk my head toward the sound,and what do i see, but a HUGE tree crack! The piece fell on the ground. It was scary. Then, everyone got called in to eat dinner. During the trip we did activities like kayaking (it was fun!), outdoor adventure- where we had to build a shelter, intiatives-we had to jump from one swinging tire to the other, co-operative games-we had to work as a team to solve the problems, orientating- using a compass, rock climbing- almost made it to the top, vertical playground- had to climb on ropes, and tires, didn't even try, and of course archery! At the campfire every night, we sang sings like "There was a great big moose", and "Mmm Mmm went the little green green frog one day" and lots more. We also played the Wenonah stock exchange, which was okay, and on the last day we had monster realy. All the kids get split into 2 teams, and each person in the team has to do something like kayak, or sing "O Canada" while pouring water into a bucket. I had to put a broom to my nose and run in circles 10 times. I was very sad to leave, knowing that i will never go back again, but at least i got to go!!!!!!!

       HellO! I am still at Sahi's house. Today is the last whole day we will be soending here. We are leaving tomorrow afternoon! Well, Yesterday we went to the Detroit Science Center, and we watched a thing in the planetorium, and we watched an imax movie (Jane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees)! It was fun. We were at the science center for about 5 hours! On the way back, we picked up some videos, and then the adults dropped us three off at home, and they went shopping. So, we put in the Lord of the Rings, and relaxed with popcorn. At around 9:30, they came home with pizza and breadsticks. I was STARVING!! After we ate, I was sooo tired, but I satyed awake beacause we were watching Sontham, and that movie was hilarious! After that I had to drag myself to brush and change, and as soon as I lay in bed...I fell asleep!

       hola! one week of christmas holidays are already over... so fast. On saturday we went to Raji aunty's housewarming party, and on saturday we set out to daddy's place in Bruce for one last time. We stayed there for three days and during that time we mostly played cards and watched TV. On tuesday we watched a movie at the Port Elgin Theatres - Mona Lisa Smile. It was okay, though the theme was confusing. On wednesday evening Sahithi &amp; family came over with a surprise guest... Mahesh Babai!! For christmas I got a Discman with a car kit from Santa Claus! I got a sweater from Sasi attha and lots more. The rest of the time we watched movies (Kal ho na ho {very good!}, Dil, and Ownu, Vall-Iddaru Ishtapadaru), and we talked. Sahi, Anna, Mahesh Babai, and I also went to watch the last of the trilogy of Lord of the Rings - Return of the King. It was extrordinary!!!!! The best! Today we went to Choudary Uncle's place for lunch and we came back at 5:00, and they all left back to Detroit soon after. That's all for now... only one more week of holidays left before the terror of High School and exams start again. Until then...adios!!
