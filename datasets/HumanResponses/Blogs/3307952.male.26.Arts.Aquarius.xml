      This is where you'll be able to keep up with what my friends are involved in.  We'll start with  Eugene Cordero :  I met Eugene in an improv intensive we took last summer. Eugene just booked a pilot on the  urlLink Oxygen Network . The show is an improvised comedy about a salon. As far as I know, Eugene will be portraying a character he came up with for the audition. He played a "thug" who only sweeps the floors at the salon so that he can see all the "hot girls" that come in and out. I'll let you know if/when the pilot airs, and whether or not it gets picked up.   Andy Zilch    urlLink Andy  and I went to college together. After finishing on  urlLink Spider Man 2 , Andy just started a new job on a film called  urlLink Art School Confidential , directed by  urlLink Terry Zwigoff . Another bit of good news: Andy's film  urlLink The Custodial Code  has been showing at short film festivals around the country and has taken a few awards. I wish I could be more specific... I'll call Andy and have him provide me with the updates. Anyway, it's a funny film. See it.   Matt Peterson   You know... my best friend since fourth grade. He graduated this Sunday with his Masters of Divinity, and is accepting a call in Green Lake, Minnesota. He's gonna be a pastor. He's my golden ticket into Heaven.   My CWRU Classmates   Patrick is working at Sylvan Learning Centers tutoring children in math. He starts up the UCB intensive on June 1st, and then goes off to teach at skateboard camp. He's got a fun summer lined up.  Virginia lives with me and is awesome. She's on the prowl for temp jobs. I like her.  Simon works for Polo/Ralph Lauren. He's a bigwig now. Don't call him, he'll call you.  Matty is putting in a bid on a house in the next couple days with his partner, Scott. Crazy. Then he's gonna start that theater we're all going to work at.  Cat just moved into her new apartment with Joe! She's excited. She also just had a birthday - May 25.  I haven't heard from Mary Gen or Emily since coming out here... I know M.G. will be in South Dakota this summer performing in "The King & I" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf". Emily and Jon either have already moved or are about to move to Sacramento. I'll let you know more when I hear more.

      I've now heard from Mary Gen, Emily and a little more from Matty J.  Mary Gen has just opened "Playboy of The Western World" at  urlLink Black Hills Playhouse  after only eight days of rehearsal. Crazy. She's working overtime to make up for the guilt she feels about getting her first full paycheck just for acting. She's crazy.  Emily is in Sacramento and is working part-time with her realtor. She said to give her a few years, and she'll be like  urlLink Annette Bening  in American Beauty. I believe it.  And this just in from Matt Joslyn: "Here in Sandusky, I am now the pinch hitting director for Ohio's oldest Community Theatre's production of Annie. 56 kids. Oh yes. 56. The original director decided to leave without telling anyone after 3 weeks of rehearsal and having only staged the first scene. None of the kids knew the music. At all. And they don't want me to cut anything. And his prop list was 6 pages long... like he was doing a movie. And we open 2 weeks from today. $0 and stage parents.    Priceless.   Seriously though... I love it."

       What a bummer.  Virginia, our friend Elizabeth and I waited in line at 6:30 this morning for standby tickets to  urlLink Saturday Night Live . We arrived at the evening standby line at 7:00pm, and waited & waited... until they told us that they were full. We were about 20 people away from getting in. If only we had arrived 45 minutes earlier! I wouldn't be so bummed if it wasn't the season finale... but it was. Oh, well. I guess I'll have to wait a while before I get to see Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen in person. C'est la vie.

        urlLink    Even better? They've renamed 15th St. "Lee Strasberg Way" as some attempt to honor ol' Lee. *sigh* Let me remind you of the glorious Stella Adler quote, following the moment of silence she required her class to take upon news of Strasberg's death: "It will take a hundred years before the harm that man has done to the art of acting can be corrected." Agreed.

       So we're in our place. You can see from the photos that it's a little guy. But we love it! I think that once we're unpacked, we'll find that we can survive quite nicely in a place like this. The location is  unbelievable.  Virginia and I took a little stroll around the blocks near us and found everything we could ever want - video place, grocery stores, pizza joint, Barnes & Noble, The Strand, et cetera. It's awesome. We've got a pizza and have settled in for the "Frasier" finale. Hope all is well with all of you...

       Guess what.  Rain makes things wet.  Especially things that are being carried in a backpack on someone's back while he walks through some of the most horribly torrential rain he's ever seen.  For ten blocks.  *sigh*  Anyway, the recording gig was great. I could hear Chas from Stern Advertising in my headphones as she directed me from Commercial Recording in Cleveland. It's nearly the same script I did for them last year ("Dinosaurs" at  urlLink Cleveland Metroparks Zoo ), but it's been 'updated' for the return of the exhibit. Chas seemed to suggest that I could expect calls from her in the future... here's hoping.  We saw our apartment for the first time today, and we move in tomorrow... more on that then. (hint: it's not huge)

       So, as I was leaving to meet with one of my professors for a farewell coffee this afternoon, my cell phone rang. It was my agent in Cleveland, asking if I was in NYC yet. I said that I  would  be in about 24 hours. She said, "can you be there by 3:00?" She then went on to explain that the Cleveland ad agency with whom I've done a few spots has a gig for me, but they thought I was in NYC, so they booked a New York studio space for an hour tomorrow afternoon so that I could still do the job. I'm very excited to already have a New York gig! No, it's not for a New York client, but it'll be great to get in there and meet with New York pros on my first day in The City.  Yay!

       Although I had originally planned to do a monthly newsletter for The Rich Sommer Fan Club, I've changed my mind and decided to begin this web journal. I will be able to update it whenever anything of note occurs, so you can safely assume that nothing much will have changed since whatever the last posted entry says.   I leave for New York in about 14 hours or so. Virginia (my girlfriend, for those of you who don't know) and I just ate at  urlLink Nighttown , one of our favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I'm just about to do my final pass through the apartment to get any trash or dust or candy wrappers thrown away. I'm excited and sad to be leaving, but I know it's going to be a blast in NYC. I can't wait to get there/out of here.  I have three appointments this Thursday and Friday with temp agencies. I've got to begin making money ASAP.   The goodbyes here in Cleveland have been sad, weird and drawn out. We began our farewells about two weeks ago, and they just keep coming. There's been at least one per day for about a week now, and it's emotionally draining. Tonight I say goodbye to Jeff Marsey, a lovely gentleman whom I befriended when he was an undergrad during my first year here. It'll definitely be one of the harder goodbyes.  So, here it goes! I'll keep you posted on how things are going. Feel free to live vicariously through me. Although you might be bored doing so, because I spend most of my time playing around on my computer.

       I read on the  urlLink IRC  about some people trying to put together a dodgeball team. I hadn't played since I was a wee lad, so I was a bit curious. As I checked into it, I discovered that there was a city-wide invitational tournament - the fourth since March. It's called  urlLink The International Dodgeball Tournament of Champions IV . I could have joined a team, but I decided to answer the call to referee some of the matches. I have no experience reffing (anything), but I'd always thought it looked fun.   I learned one major lesson: when you make a call,  stick to it . It's tough when entire teams are bitching about a decision you've made, but you have to stick to your guns or your authority will be diminished to nothing. One call will haunt me for the rest of my days (or until I forget about it)... an incoming ball hit the foot of one of the players and bounced into his arms. He caught it. Now, the rules state: if you're hit by a ball, you're out. If you catch a ball, the thrower is out.  If the ball hits you and you catch it before it hits anything else, the thrower is out.  This latter rule is the one that I momentarily forgot. I called the player out after he caught the ball. I stuck to my call, even after his team's protests. It wasn't until about thirty seconds later that I realized I had been incorrect; that the  thrower  should have been called out. Now, this was not a decisive call - that's to say, this call did not really affect the outcome of the match either way... but my guilt remains. I only ended up waffling on about ten percent of my calls, but that was way too many. I need to remain open to the possibility that I was wrong, but stand by my decisions on the whole.  Anyway, it was a total blast, and I can't wait until the next tourney. Spectators are welcome and admission is free, so check it out sometime. By the way, people from  urlLink WB 11  and  urlLink WNYC  radio were there doing stories on the tourney. The guy from WNYC said that the story would be archived on the internet, so I'll be sure to post the link when it's available.

       Hooray! Today, I joined the ranks of the New York working class! You'd better believe I put that Master's degree to good use! For $12.50/hour, I became a productive member of society. If you're planning to move to New York, you'd better be ready to  work ! Here's how my day went, from start to finish:  10:00 Arrive at work 10:05 Begin shredding documents 10:40 Finish shredding documents 10:42 Get water 10:45 Read improv book 11:33 Get Coke (caffeine-free, after watching "SUPER SIZE ME") 11:35 Continue reading improv book 1:05 Meet Virginia for lunch 1:35 Return to office 1:36 Begin sorting documents 1:48 Finish sorting documents 1:49 Begin surfing internet 5:30 End of day!   Whew!  When you work as hard as I do, it's nice to relax in the evening with your girlfriend and watch "Colonial House" on PBS to unwind. So that's what I'm doing tonight.

       Well, we made up for last night. Virginia and I decided to call for reservations to the  urlLink The Upright Citizens Brigade 's "ASSSSCAT 3000" show. As some of you may know, this was the improv theater where I was enrolled in classes last summer. In tonight's cast were SNL cast members  urlLink Amy Poehler  and  urlLink Seth Meyers , and UCB regulars  urlLink Rob Riggle ,  urlLink Rob Heubel ,  urlLink Jack McBrayer  and Miriam Tolan. The special guest monologist was  urlLink Jason Bateman  from "Arrested Development" on Fox. It was awesome. We sat in the front row, courtesy of one of my poker buddies from last summer.   I love that place. If any of you come to NYC, it's one of the first places I'll drag you.  I was reminded, as I sometimes need to be, why I love improvisation so much. The  ease  with which they create characters, interact with each other, et cetera is so amazing to behold. It's something to aspire to, that's for sure. So smart. So smooth. I love it. I can't wait to get back into it.

       Virginia and I saw  urlLink Fiddler on the Roof  tonight. It was lovely. The singers were a) loud and b) friggin' good.  I laughed, I cried. I want to be Tevye in about twenty years.  And here's why I like  urlLink Alfred Molina : There was an understudy in last night for the role of Tzietel, and, as he came out for his big, Broadway star bow, Molina stopped to kiss her hand and recognize her. I thought that was nice. Many other "big stars" would have raced on out for their moment in the sun, but he stopped to give her a little nod. I thought that was great. It made me happy.  Understudying sucks, and it's nice when your castmates know that and celebrate your hard work.  Especially if your castmate is freakin' Alfred Molina.

       I've added an area to this site with information about my friends, if you're curious. Go into my profile and click on the link. Enjoy. My friends are cool.  Virginia and I are going to visit her sister and brother-in-law this weekend in Connecticut. Should be nice. We're also going to see "Fiddler" tonight. I like Alfred Molina. I hope he's good.  My job is stressful.   But I like having a job.

       I got a new job yesterday. This one is supposed to last "indefinitely," which could mean three days, three weeks, or three months. No one seems to know. I am temporarily replacing an administrative assistant who is leaving her post to work for her company's main competition. She's nice. Her name is Belinda. She's showin' me the ropes.  Oh, and there are a lot of ropes. This phone system is one of the most screwy I've ever encountered. I can't guess how many people I've hung up on while attempting to put them into someone's voicemail. And emailing is done through a program I have zero experience with - Lotus Notes. I seem to recall Dad using the program when I was growing up, but that doesn't count for much. Not that email is that difficult to figure out, but it's not just my email... I have to access the email of the three people I support, so it's their signature... but it's my ass.  Anyway, performance anxiety aside, it's a nice office where the people are friendly, if a little stressed. I hope the job lasts for a little while. I could stomach some financial stability right about now.

       1. For fun, I took some pictures of my work area and stiched them together. Did you need to see this? No, but I thought it would be fun to try stitching five pictures together:  urlLink     2. Virginia and I witnessed something horrible tonight. As we were walking home from dropping off our laundry at the local laundry joint (because we Manhattanites pay to have our laundry done for us), we heard squealing tires behind us. We wheeled around just in time to see a young woman get hit by a taxi. Luckily, it wasn't a full-blown frontal hit... it was more like when Matt Peterson and I hit a deer with his car on the way home from Metigoshe. She rolled along the side of the car and smacked her head on the windshield. I ran over and was the first person on the scene (lucky her). She was almost immediately in shock/knocked out, and blood started dripping from her mouth. I yelled for Virginia to call 911, which she did. I got down on the ground and tried talking to her. The cab driver got out and tried to roll her onto her back. I stopped him and told him not to move her. I had two shirts on, so I took the top one off and put it under her head. As I did so, a guy in shorts came up and identified himself as an emergency room doctor. Thank goodness. He took over and started talking to her. He had just asked me to check her pulse, when a woman stepped up and said she was a nurse. She took over on the pulse thing. Thank goodness again. Anyway, long story short, there were three ambulances there withing ten or fifteen minutes. The doctor told me to stay as a witness, but I didn't have much to offer since all I saw was the impact itself.   I felt bad for the cabbie. I don't think it was entirely his fault. The roads were wet and, as far as I could tell, the chick walked right in front of him.    Any way, it sucked. Glad I was there and was able to help in the little ways I could... although I'll miss my free Cleveland Indians shirt from MBNA. Oh, well.  Scary stuff.

       This has possibly been the busiest day I've ever had... or at least one of the most stressful. My "job" actually began for real today, since the woman I'm replacing was gone for the first time. So that sucked. Then, they took away my computer so that they could remove all of her stuff and put on all of mine. So that left me with no possibility of being productive, but that didn't stop my boss and his minions from assigning work to me.  Which I couldn't do.  Then, I went straight from work to The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater to start my internship. In the coming weeks, this won't be so bad. But today, when I'm coming off of a very stressful day, the last thing I want to do is embark on another job I don't know how to do. I'm doing okay at this one, because I have in my possession all of the requisite tools to do my job.  I've had a relatively leisurely few weeks here. Now begins the busy season... work five days a week, intern two nights a week, and take two classes on the weekends. This is what I wanted. It is. It's just too bad I have to eschew sleep/friends/food/my girlfriend to do it.  But enough complaining! I AM JAZZED FOR THIS.  I mean it.  (I know that sounds sarcastic, but it's not.)

        urlLink    Here you go. Something creepy for your files. This is a wax statue of Reagan. It's been in front of  urlLink Madame Tussaud's  on 42nd Street since the announcement of his death. He looks bloated and too red-headed to me. I had to fight through lots of tourists who were getting shots with the statue. Yikes.

       So, in the ever-continuing search for my motivation, I decided to research Boot Camp workouts. These are workouts designed to simulate military-style physical training for one hour a day. Fun, right? Yeah. Fun.  The one place I could find in NYC that does Boot Camps is a company called  urlLink Platoon Fitness . They give you three free workouts, so Virginia and I decided that we would give one a whirl this morning. The catch: They meet at 5:30. In the morning. Since the meetings are in  urlLink Central Park , Virginia and I had to get up at 4:30 so we could catch a subway, transfer at Times Square, and make it there on time.    The good news : Central Park is awesome. It's one of my favorite places in New York, and it's even better when there's no one there and it's brisk outside. We got a big ol' dose of "brisk/no one around" while we were there this morning.   The bad news : Apparently, and no one informed me of this, military physical training is challenging. Not much resting. Not much walking. Lots of running up lots of stairs. Your reward for running and climbing? Push-ups! And sit-ups! And various other ways of having pain-inducing fun!   Yes, it was fun. Yes, Virginia and I had a helluva workout. No, I won't be going back, and not necessarily because I didn't like it. I just can't swing the whole 4:30 reveille thing, especially when I'm doing stuff most nights for my improv internships. But  you  should go! Have fun! Let me know how you like it! My guarantee: if they begin offering afternoon/evening classes, I will give it another try. Until then, don't call me until after 8:00am, at the earliest.

       I have an audition this Saturday for a group called  urlLink Chicago City Limits . My friend Eugene is a member of the group, and recommended me for the invite-only audition. I'm excited. I'm trying out for their touring company, which would mean I would get to leave the city once in a while and get paid for it. I'll let you know how it goes down. Fingers crossed, expectations low.  I started my class at  urlLink The P.I.T.  on Sunday. It's a class on writing a one-person show, and I'm scared. I've never written anything in my life (save some edits on The SlushPuppies final show in 2000), so this is a big hairy deal. I have a 5-8 minute solo performance as my final project in about nine weeks, so I'll let you know about that as the time comes.  I've decided to re-take the last class I took at UCB because it's been a year since I took it, and I don't want to advance until I'm ready. The good news: there are two scheduled class performances, and one of them happens to be on the Saturday preceding my agent showcase here in NYC. So, MFA friends, if you're in town the day before our big rehearsal, you are invited to join me at UCB for what is sure to be a fearful ride. Plus, it's being taught by my poker pal  urlLink Kevin Mullaney , and I hear he's fantastic. Should be fun.  One last tidbit of weird info: Through a connection with  urlLink Rich Melheim  in Stillwater, I got hooked up with  urlLink Thomas Ian Nicholas  (from the  urlLink American Pie  movies) to help with promoting a movie he and his brother made called  urlLink L.A. D.J. . Long story short, after some emails and a couple phone calls, I got him slated to do the monologues at  urlLink ASSSSCAT  this Sunday. Virginia and I will meet him at the theater and introduce him around. Should be pretty fun!

       The meeting at Chicago City Limits was fine. Nothing unexpected. I did learn the following fun facts:  * As a member of the Touring Company, I'll be understudying the mainstage show. * I'll be performing every Wednesday night as part of my understudy duties. * I'll get paid. Not much, but I'll get paid. * The fall will be the big touring time, with stops at colleges all over the place.  I'm excited. I start rehearsals on Wednesday night...

       So, I got into Chicago City Limits! I got a call from Paul Zuckerman, the artistic director. He said that they had enjoyed my audition and would like to work with me. Then he asked that I come in for a meeting with him to discuss the commitment the group is going to take.   That part makes me nervous.  It shouldn't be a big deal. I'm fairly aware of what the group requires time-wise. It's my understanding that they rehearse Wednesday nights and travel 1-2 weekends per month, sometimes taking longer trips of up to 10 days. I'm guessing they're just going to suggest that I keep on temping so I'm available for gigs. Something like that.  But I still get nervous when someone wants to discuss the "commitment" something requires.    The good news:  I got into something I auditioned for. That's a nice thing.  urlLink Plus, they travel all over the country.  My hope is that the group will, at some point, give me the chance to see some of my friends and family... That'd be a nice perk.

       As if this site wasn't fun enough...  See those two little buttons at the top of the bar on the right? The one that says "Subscribe With Bloglines" allows you to receive an email every time I update the site. Won't that be fun? The other button, the green one with the guy heading for the door, takes you away from this site instantly in case your boss comes around the corner and doesn't like you looking at pictures of Reagan's wax dummy. Try it out.  I just aim to please. It's all I know how to do.

       So, I auditioned for Chicago City Limits on Saturday, and had a callback with them last night. I didn't say much about the group before... basically, they're New York's longest-running comedy revue. Whatever that means. You can find out more about the group and its history  urlLink here . Anyway, it's the place where a few Minnesota improvisers cut their New York teeth - Victor Varnado and Colton Dunn, to name two.  SO. My audition on Saturday was fun and felt good. I wrote the following in my "improv nerd notebook" on the train ride home:  The thing I appreciated was their effort to lower the pressure on us. 'If the worst thing is that you had fun on stage for two hours, that'd be okay.' We did a 45-60 minute warm-up: group games, then half the group worked on conducted stories and the other half worked on scenes upstairs - then switched. For the actual audition, we did two 2-person scenes, a conducted story and the verse and chorus of an improvised solo song. All in all, a good time. I think I acquitted myself well. I had fun, made good moves, etc. My only wish: I could have varied my energy a bit more. I was the 'loud, semi-angry guy' for much of the day. Could have shown them another side.  Yep. That's how the first day went. I heard on Sunday that I had a callback. When I arrived, I saw that eight of the original thirteen had been called back - Five men, three women. From my notebook regarding last night:  Ugh. Didn't feel as good about this one. We did mostly the same stuff as we did in the initial audition, with an added character creation exercise....My song? SUCK. Hey, did you know 'can' rhymes with 'can'? It does.  Needless to say, I was a little salty following the callback. I'm hoping my slightly off night won't affect my eligibility to be in the group. Oh, well. I'll let y'all know as soon as I hear anything.

       I got a call earlier today from some guy at a law firm, saying that he was calling on behalf of a client whom I had witnessed being struck by a car. ( urlLink Here's the story ) I stopped him right there and asked if she was okay. He said that she was, but that she was considering legal action against the guy that hit her. He went on to ask if I would be willing to give an official witness testimony regarding the accident. I said I would, but that I hadn't really seen much of what actually happened, just the aftermath. He didn't seem to care. He wants whatever I can give him.  I'm just very happy to know that she's alive and well. It's bugged me since the incident, and it's nice to know.

         These guys are on many street corners in the major traffic areas of NYC - this guy was on 45th Street and 7th Avenue in Times Square yesterday. That shiny thing in his hands? A big gun. It's not an entirely uncommon sight anymore, but it still freaks me out a little whenever I notice one of these guys standing right next to me.   I see them talking to tourists a lot. Maybe they're our equivalent to the Buckingham Palace guards, except they talk and smile.   Maybe.

       Boring, loring, zoring.  Boring.  I wish I had more to update everyone on, but I don't.  Ooh, but I  have  developed a new insecurity. After being an improviser for so long, I've developed a pretty thick skin to funny stuff on stage. Essentially, I can get through almost any scene without laughing.  Until very recently.  I've had two rehearsals for CCL since being cast in their Touring Company, and I couldn't get through either of them with a straight face. And not just little cracks, either. Full on, talk-stopping, outloud laughter. Ridiculous. It doesn't make me look that great in front of the company I've just joined. Plus, it's like friggin' church: once you start, there's no stopping.  I'm hoping it's just because I don't know these guys well enough yet. Once I know them better, maybe I'll be more ready to stay in a scene. But for now, they're just too damn funny, and I can't help but laugh.  P.S. I think I misuse commas. If you notice me misusing commas, let me know. It'll be our little summer project: Fix Rich's Punctuation.

       About a week ago, I was heading to the R train in Union Square, and a guy with a blue shirt that said "Jews for Jesus" handed me a pamphlet. Usually, I walk right past people trying to shove something in my hand, but my curiosity got the best of me this time. So I grabbed one.   As I continued walking and descended the stairs into the waiting area, an older man wearing a yarmulke caught up with me. "Excuse me! Excuse me!" I turned around, and he shoved a different pamphlet in my hand. I said, "thanks" and continued on.  Frankly, I figured the guy saw me take a brochure from someone else, so he pegged me for an easy mark. However, when I unfolded and read his leaflet, I learned that he chased me down because I took a leaflet from a "Jews For Jesus" reprensentative. This guy was  counter-leafletting  - a term I only learned as I read his paper.   To be honest, I don't really care. I just thought the whole thing was very interesting. The counter-leaflet claimed that "Jews For Jesus" and groups like it are Christian organizations masquerading as Jewish groups.  urlLink Here's an article regarding the schism.  The claim was that neither Christian groups nor Jewish groups should support such a melding of the religions, and I might agree there. I just think it's a cool subculture - counter-leafletters. I think it's fascinating. It might add a little excitement to the mundanity of standing in the subway and trying to pass things on to people who don't want them.

       The Republican National Convention will be held in a few weeks, a mere four blocks from one of the theaters I work at. This was the cover of  urlLink AM New York  today:     Now, admittedly, this newspaper has the journalistic integrity of a sub-par New York Post. Still, parts of the article made me squirm just a little in my subway seat this morning:  A Madrid-style train bombing could be terrorists' next move, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said yesterday, citing no specific plots against the convention or the city but a "consensus in the intelligence community that New York is the number one target." It's silly, really. I know I'm just buying into the whole "fear mentality," but it's difficult not to when this is on the cover of the newspapers you read and headlining the news every night and being talked about by every person on the street or at work.  By the way, those are antidotes in that guy's hand in the picture. I hope I don't need to have one of those needles jabbed into me. I don't like needles.

       I just got back from my first gig at Chicago City Limits.   Yes, it  is  the middle of the day.  Yes, I  have  only had four or five rehearsals.  Yes, it  was  for 200 nine- and ten-year-olds.  But it was a blast. I was terrified, believe me. I still don't know the forms very well, nor do I know the way CCL likes to introduce them. But I had to figure it out right quick, and it was fun. My fellow players were  urlLink Kimmy Gatewood ,  urlLink Morgan Phillips  and  urlLink Brian Finkelstein . They were very accomodating, considering that they've all done a million gigs at CCL, and this was my first one.  We opened with a  Campfire Song , which we decided to do because the group was from a camp. We then did  urlLink Ding  (aka New Choice),  Pillars  (aka Hesitation),  Audience Sound Effects , a  Conducted Story  and a  Musical . It was fun to get to play like the old days... it felt a lot like The SlushPuppies did. Very playful, very creative, anything goes.   I'm certainly not saying that this type of performance is easier than, say, long-form improv. Or any less or more fun. It's just very different, and I didn't realize how much I had missed it. Now, I'm just looking forward to doing it with a little more confidence and a slightly more interested crowd.

       I just got back from my meeting with the other manager.  Nice guy, but I don't know. These managers seem like they're really just agents who get to charge a larger commission. This place would take 15% of everything I do. That, combined with the 10% the agent takes, makes 25% of your income,  before taxes , that goes away. Poof. I don't know how I feel about that.   I don't know that having a manager is necessarily the thing for me yet. One thing I've heard is that they can be useful when an actor decides to be bicoastal... but I'm still working on being  uni coastal. Who knows? I did leave a few headshots with him so that I could begin freelancing with him, but that will go away if I decide to sign with the agent from yesterday. We'll see what happens.  Ooh, and this was fun: I forgot to mention that I hand delivered my headshots to all of the places that said they wanted them. I wouldn't do this for cold submissions, but these were direct requests. As I was dropping at one of the offices, I asked if the person out front could make sure that the requester received it. She said that the requester had just stepped out, and she would see that she got it. As I was waiting for the elevator, I heard footsteps. A woman came around the corner and said, "Oh. I was at your showcase the other night." I introduced myself and we shook hands. Long story short, she told me that she was the assistant to the head agent, and would be passing my info on to her. I called today to follow up, and I got another appointment! Yay. That's good news. The more agents I can meet with, the better.  Bye.

       I received nine responses from the showcase: two from managers, two from casting people for specific organizations, and the rest agents. Two of the agents wanted meetings, and the other three just wanted me to submit my headshot and resume. I've had two meetings so far, one with a manager and one with an agent. I'm going to be careful with the whole "naming names" thing... I'm too new here to have some agent Google herself and find me bitching about them. I know, they're never gonna know who I am, blah blah blah... shut up. I'm overly careful. Deal.  The manager and his partner were very welcoming and kind. They had nice things to say about the showcase. I asked about their client base, and they said, "It's right behind you." There were about 20-25 pictures on the wall of the people they represent. They were very encouraging, not at all pushy, and happy to let me think about things. They said that their commission is 10%. Some problems: 1. Only about 1/2 of their clients also have agents, which probably means they are serving as agents themselves, which falls into the "against the rules" category. 2. They're mainly theatre-focused, and I would like to focus elsewhere. (But the fact that they're mainly  anything  again leads me to believe that they are acting as agents, which is, again, against the rules.) Not that I won't participate in regional theater - I would love to do  anything  - but I want people who are more evenly covering theatre, film and television.  In the end, they offered to freelance with me for a few months, but are ready to sign when I am. All in all, a great meeting, and, were they agents, I might consider going with them. But I'm not sure yet.  My agent meeting was nice, too. I bumped into Patrick (one of my classmates) on the way out. That was fun. They have both a legit and commercial division, and I met with their commercial representative first. The commercial division is brand new. They aren't even signing any clients yet, so that's a little less pressure for me. She was very nice, and we had a great chat. We had to kill a few minutes while the head honcho was finishing up a phone call, so we chatted about the showcase and my engagement to The Lovely Virginia. It was nice. I showed her pictures. I like my fiance.   Any way, I finally got to meet with the head agent, who mainly focuses on legit work, but works in film and TV fairly extensively. That's a bonus. She was great. She was very honest, which I love. She said:  Look. Here's why I hesitate to sign people like you. You're young. There's not a lot for you beyond the commercial world. You could do Law & Order, but there aren't many episodes shot on college campuses, and that's all you could do right now. You know there's not a lot of roles for you in theatre, either. It's tough. In a few years, you'll look older. It'll be easier. But for now, even if I send you out on every single thing that you're right for, it's not going to be very often. Huh.   Well, I know that. It was one of the tough truths that were pounded into me during our "Business of The Business" class. It's strange to hear someone else say it, but not shocking. I asked if she even thought it would make sense for me to sign with her, or whether it would be a complete waste of her time. Her:  I think you should. It's not a waste of time, as long as you have a chance. I can't promise you parts, but I can promise you the chance at parts that you're right for. You won't get that on your own. Okay. I can go with that.   I think we hit it off well. She gave me the contracts to look over and said to call her when I'm done meeting with my other nibbles and ready to make a decision. Oh, and she refuses to work with managers. So, if I go with her, it's her and her alone. Which is fine. I don't think I want a manager anyway.  Oh, and one more thing: as I was leaving the office, the commercial rep. called me back into her office. She said that she had made a submission for a commercial earlier that day featuring actors who could do weird stuff. As she was glancing at my resume, she noticed that I could balance large objects on my chin. She called the Casting Director and asked if that would be something she'd be interested in seeing, and it was. So I have an audition on Monday. Not a big deal, but I thought it was cool to have an audition as I was leaving my first meeting. Kinda fun.  I have another meeting with a manager this afternoon, and another agent meeting next week. I'll keep you posted.

       I did an audition yesterday for a new MTV show. It was a fun audition. It was entirely improvised, and I like those the best.  The premise is along the lines of  urlLink Punk'd , but with real people instead of celebrities. The idea of the audition was that a kid is left home alone for a weekend, and his parents have told him that "a couple people may be stopping by," and to let them do what they need to do. Then, those of us who were auditioning had to choose which visiting character we wanted to be: a plumber with terrible eyesight, a manager who is planning to bring some strippers over to the house, a realtor who is eyeing the house for a sale, etc. I chose to portray an "Irate Employee" who has just been fired by the kid's dad.  The dude playing the kid was probably 22-or-so, and was fun to play with. He just sat in disbelief as I ranted against his father for five or seven minutes. It was a blast. It was the ind of audition I dream of: one where it's just fun for the sake of being fun. Of course I hope for a callback, but the audition itself was damn fun. We'll see what happens.

       This is weird. Does anyone know who submitted this?  From yesterday's Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper:   Love on stage:   Ah, romance, and a master of fine arts degree. At an actors showcase last week in New York for six students receiving the degree in a Case Western Reserve University/Cleveland Play House cooperative program, there was some added drama. Graduate Rich Sommer dropped to one knee onstage, surprising classmate Virginia Donohoe with a marriage proposal. She said yes on the spot.     Almost accurate. Didn't do it on stage, eight of us graduated... but still funny. I'm curious.  Here's a  urlLink link  to the article.

       I just got word that I was not cast in the Law & Order episode. The good news: The casting director for the show called the manager who got me the audition in the first place to give me feedback. She said that I just wasn't what the director had in mind for the role, but that I gave a very good read and probably have a Law & Order in my future. Besides being cast, what more could I ask for?  I've only been in the game for ten days. I'm pretty happy with it so far.

       I just got back from my Law & Order callback. These are my interpretations of the thought processes surrounding an audition where I felt like I gave a good reading.  Before the initial audition:   Wow. Look at this script. I'm surprised that I got submitted for this. I guess I  could  be this guy. Maybe. They may have to stretch their imaginations a bit, but I could do it. This is tough material. How the hell am I supposed to say  that  line? This is hard. Oh, well. Here goes nothin'.   After the inital audition:   Huh. That was interesting. Well, if they can deal with how young I look, I might be up for a callback. But I'd be surprised. This is hard. Well, it was fun while it lasted. At least I got to read. And I didn't end up entirely humiliating myself, so that's a good thing.   After hearing about getting the callback:   Holy crap! I did it! I can't believe I got the callback! I might actually get this part. I never considered myself right for it, but I must be in the running! Wow. Wow. This is awesome. I am happy. I wonder what the set will be like. Will I get to meet anyone famous? I wonder how hot we'll be when we're filming. I hope it's not too sunny that day. Man. I can't wait.   Upon arrival at the callback:   Uh oh. Look at that guy. He looks a lot more like a firefighter than I do. Wait - he has a different script. Whew. He's here for a different part. One competitor down. Wait - look at that guy. He's got a FDNY t-shirt. Shit. Why didn't I think of that? What am I doing in khakis? Firefighters don't wear khakis. I'm screwed. Plus, he's 35 or so. That's more like a firefighter. Crap. What are the lines again? Why do I keep forgetting that word? I'm screwed.   After the callback:   Could have been worse.   So that's how it goes. As I always say, my hopes are high and my expectations are low. The experience alone was a blast, and I am so excited that I got this far. I hope it's not the only callback I ever get.

       I had two auditions yesterday. One was fun. One was not.  Let's start with the not fun one. The audition was for a commercial for a new candy bar, and they wanted people who could do weird tricks to come in and perform them. I made the mistake of telling a prospective agent that I could balance big things on my chin, so they submitted me.   (Sidenote: I  can  balance big things on my chin. A guitar, a ladder, brooms, 2x4s, etc. I can do that. But I'm not a professional.)  Anyway, I wanted to bring in something fun to balance, since I wanted them to remember me. After scouring our apartment for something interesting, I landed on the most fascinating thing we had that could be balanced. I thought, "It's unique, I can break it down to fit it in my bag, it's perfect!":  A friggin'  urlLink Swiffer .   I'm stupid.  I ended up having almost no chance to practice with it. Had I taken to time to practice, I would have discovered then (instead of  at the audition ) that a Swiffer's lightness and low density, while great for getting dirt out of hard-to-reach places, is not conducive to balancing on a chin.   After a short interview (read:  lie ) about "how I discovered this amazing talent," I tilted my head back and placed the handle on my chin. I weaved back and forth, trying to remain jovial and confident. "I'll get it!", I proclaimed. I began sweating and shaking a little. Again - I'm no pro - but sweating and shaking add a little challenge to balancing. I know. Shocking.   Needless to say, I didn't "get it." I took the Swiffer off of my chin, took it apart as quickly as I could, shoved it in my bag, thanked the auditors, and got out as quickly as I could.   FUN SIDE NOTE:  The guys ahead of and behind me in line were members of a college clown troupe. And were balancing large objects on their faces. I think we can safely count out the chance of seeing me advertising any candy bars any time soon.
