      So, the Greens chose David Cobb. Now, the question on my mind is: Who the hell is David Cobb? Is anyone going to vote for this guy? I get the feeling that after 2000, most people's opinion of the Green Party went from "undecided" to "negative", and choosing someone who nobody's never heard of isn't going to help matters. Meanwhile, the far-left who thinks Kerry sucks is just going to follow the Pied Piper of Nader,  urlLink whose ego continues to grow each day.   It's like I said downthread: if they're going to make any impact (other than "spoiling" the election), third parties need to gain some legitimacy. Don't keep going for the the blatant attention grab, concentrate on actually  winning  elections.

       urlLink The story.    urlLink Official press release   An ex-Socialist candidate for President?  Ex-Green candidate for governor of California?  What, exactly, is Nader trying to pull here?  Is he trying to get me to vote for him?  You?  I thought he was only after conservative votes this time around....  Ezra of Democratic blog Pandagon  urlLink weighs in.   I think a bland socialist who has never won an election would make for an optimal Vice President.  Camejo would be far better than anyone on Kerry's short list.

      The Independent Media Center has been an important organizing tool ever since its creation (only about five years ago). It is run by dedicated volunteers who want to help people figure out what is going on in this crazy world of ours. In times where we can never be sure when the corporate media is feeding us misinformation or omissions about events at home or abroad, the IMC has been a bastion of truth and democracy at work.   urlLink Independent Media Center   Here are my two examples:  This is an article that reports on the situation in Chiapas, Mexico right now. Many indigenous groups are struggling for autonomy but are met with violent resistance from the government and their paramilitary groups. Recently there have been some broad daylight murders of Zapatista supporters and the police have refused to open an investigation. Sound sketchy?  urlLink Zapatistas   And here is a link to an article about the anual biotech industry conference in San Francisco. There was a large group of protesters there that desparately wanted their voices to be heard. They had concerns about a number of issues that industry head who be making decisions about. Such as the continuation of genetically modified foods in our country, and the concept of genetic code as intellectual property. I always try, to no avail, to find info about these events in the mainstream media, but I always have to rely on Indymedia to tell me about these incredibly important events that will affect all our lives.  urlLink Biotech Conference

      Come on guys, what are you reading?  Post!  Here's my next link.  It's to  urlLink Jesus' General .  Hosted by General JC Christian, Patriot, it shows how manly and powerful it makes you when you are both a Christian and a patriotic American.  One of his big things is writing letters, like  urlLink this one to CNN's Aaron Brown  about how great it is to have had all the Reagan coverage.  He also gives our Dear Leader some  urlLink advice  on his campaign and shows us how great  urlLink our American values  are.  Oh, and a must visit:  urlLink The Republican Jesus archives.  (he does a new one about every week.)

      Are there any?   Nader  is cozying up with the reform party, introducing new anti-immigration and anti-porn and 'values' rhetoric into his campaign.  This  urlLink article  is from the American Conservative magazine.  Now, I don't know if this is a bad thing or a good thing.  He's still anti-corporate, but now it seems like he is just pandering to whomever he can to get a break.  But he's still fighting the two party system, and that is worth it.  Now, we have  the Libertarians , who recently held their nominating convention and picked  urlLink Michael Badnarik  as their nominee.  Yes, I know, I was just talking about not wanting to vote for stodgy old rich white guys.  But this is probably the direction I'm going this year.  They mostly want to get rid of government, and I agree with them on foreign policy (withdraw our military from other nations), drug policy (legalize), and most of their other major policy initiatives.  The only one I'm not too sure on is affirmative action (they're against it).  But, to contrast with Austin's view of getting rid of government because it enforces the concept of property, they want to strip down the government until the only thing it does is enforce the right of private property.  And I feel that at that point we would be much closer to being able to have the debate that Austin wants to have (and I want to have too).  So that's making my case here.   The Greens  seem to be planning their  urlLink nomination convention for July 24  but are considering endorsing no one.  If they do end up choosing someone, hopefully I'll be weighing in on that choice.  If anyone wants to research some other party like Socialist Workers or Constitution or something, I'd be happy to entertain their ideas.  So, the point is, why choose from the best of only two evils?  There are at least 5 or 6 evils to choose from....

      Many blogs have a blogroll, that is, links to other blogs that the author frequents.  So now we have one.  But the links don't have to be blogs, they can be any site that doesn't suck!  But, to get on our list, one of us has to post at least two examples of non-suckiness from the blog/site/whatever.  Vice versa for the links that suck list.  So, first link of the site!  This one doesn't suck!   urlLink The Poor Man   This is a blog that is chock full of inside jokes, interesting perspectives, and funny folks.  I'm a big fan.  And here are two things that I found today that didn't suck.  First,  urlLink this post  about movies such as the Shawshank Redemption.  The Editors think that the Shawshank Redemption is a bad movie, because it is so uplifting.  Now, hear me out, I loved the movie, and I bet you did too, but I think they have a good point.  The movie was uplifting, but was it realistic?  Did the uplifting qualities distract you from the fact that people in prison are generally treated horribly?  It was basically a rags to riches tale in the classic American sense, and these tales distract us from the fact that many people in this country and around the world are still in rags!  The other movie they talk about I haven't seen, but it seems to prettify war and joining the army.  I think they have some valid points.  Second,  urlLink this new Bush ad!   I don't know how he did it, but he got storyboards for Bush's next ad.  Quite impressive.*  So, now the Poor Man is on our blogroll.  Objections should be noted in the comments.  New suggestions for links that suck and links that don't suck should be posted to the blog.  Don't be lazy.  Post.    *Don't get me wrong, just because I enjoy a good Bush bashing doesn't mean I'm a Kerry fan.

      Okay guys, there's a choice for how we can do our comments here.  The way it is now, only people registered with Blogger can post with their names, and all other posts come up as anonymous.  There is a system available to us (called Haloscan) where we can make it so that everyone can post with a name and don't have to register.  It's a lot more public and all the "best" blogs usually go that route.  Of course, all the comments we've already made will be erased.  I'll re-enter all of them for you, if you like, but that's why we should try to make this decision early!  So, vote for haloscan or blogger style comments (in the comments).

      Note: Refer to previous comments for reference to this thread.     It is always difficult to know where to begin. I know my base set of assumptions about how the human world operates is very different than that of most people. I am constantly (without end or relief) reminded of this. I guess what I am used to doing is saying something that seems simply obvious to me, yet outlandish to you, and then having you question my intentions/logic/sanity. I can then respond with more detail because I have a better idea of the gulf between us. So lets have at it:  It isn't that I think the United States has an inherent flaw that other nations do not. In fact, I think the US is very good at being what it is. It is a state among states. And here-in lies the problem. The US is the best at being a state, which is the very worst form of human organization this planet has ever seen. Yes, 'best' and 'worst' are of course relative terms and mean nothing out of context. I say that best at being a state, meaning we are the best at doing what I perceive the central function of a state to be (historically speaking): maintain the institution of private property by dividing and organizing the laborforce towards cultivating and guarding resources(primarily agricultural but secondary and tertiary resources as well).  I say the worst form of human organization meaning of all the possibilities we have chosen the one that best facilitates growth without end, inequity(within our species and between our species), violence and suffering(also within and between), unsustainability, and a disconnect from the land itself. So why do we continue on this path? Why do we continue on this path?  I know, easy for me to say, right? We continue of this path because it is the only path, right? How many of us say that because we have never bothered looking for another way? How many of us belligerently deny the existence of any other way because we are afraid there might be one? And we can't imagine the guilt...because we can longer use 'this is the only way' as a justification.  Well, I say that there is another path other than the nation-state organization, and no we don't have to feel guilty about admiting to its existence. No, it isn't any kind of utopia. Everything being relative, I've never believed in perfection as a concept. It  isn't necessarily free of pain and suffering. But it is perhaps, better suited the current stage of evolution of our species. And perhaps better suited to the continuation of other lifeforms on this planet as well.  The assumption here being we are concerned with the continuation of life on this planet...

      All right, all right, here's my first stab at this thing. And no, I don't get the title either.  Kerry's likely candidates have been whittled down to a quasi-official "short list" of four people. Let's start out by taking a look at them.  Anyone for Edwards? Yeah, he's everyone's favorite. I certainly won't be surprised if Kerry announces Edwards as his pick. He's the charismatic young (in political terms, anyway) Southern populist. If the word "Clintonesque" isn't too early to be introduced into the lexicon of politics, he fits the bill (so to speak). And there's no reason Edwards shouldn't take the job: if he wins, he's got employment for the next four years (and he can always secretly hope for a heart attack during one of Kerry's impromptu hockey games), and if he doesn't, he's got all the setup he needs for a run in 2008 -- ignoring the fact that the Democrats' last failed VP crashed and burned in the primaries this year.  Two of the other candidates on the "short list" aren't very exciting. Gephardt? So unpopular outside of his congressional district, he placed fourth in the Iowa Caucuses. Vilsack? Another midwesterner that nobody cares about. If you're going to pick one of those, at least have some balls and go with Kathleen Sebelius.  This leaves us with one more guy, my personal choice for the job, General Wesley Clark. I'm not fond of Edwards' brand of all-style-no-substance politicking, and Clark's list of contributing factors are pretty attractive: he's Southern, he's got military cred, and (for those of you who think this really happens) his home state has the potential to swing for Kerry with him on the ticket. Also, he's the best choice to woo the white male voting bloc, the place where the Democrats are the weakest. And if you're worried about his lack of political experience: who cares? After November 2, the importance of the running mate decreases several hundred times.  However, my new favorite choice is Delaware Senator Joe Biden. After the  urlLink verbal thrashing he gave Ashcroft recently , he's become one of my favorite politicians. (That's Maryland for you, by the way -- even pissant little states next door have better politicians.) Of course, him getting the job is just an outside chance, so I'll stick with Wes.  Speaking of outside chances, how about that John McCain? He'd sure love the job! I can only assume that the Democrats are trying to use the tactic favored by six-year-olds of asking over and over until McCain finally throws his hands up (though not too far, what with those war injuries and all) in frustration and says "fine, I'll be on the ticket, now stop bugging me!" Look, people, the last cross-party ticket was Lincoln/Johnson in 1864, and you know how that ended up.  Anyway, you never know what might happen. He might pick the obvious choice, or he might go with someone as random as House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (who is tied with Dutch Ruppersburger for the title of "Maryland Congressman with the goofiest name"). And there's always McCain!

      Yesterday we went to  urlLink the National Zoo  and saw Tian Tian, the panda.  The other panda, Mei Xiang, was hiding in the back of the exhibit.  The pandas were very cute.  Tian Tian was enjoying his fruitcicle.  On a sad note, however, the zoo seems to be pretty poorly designed and/or run.  Even before I heard about  urlLink this stuff , I knew there were problems.  When we went two years ago, the lions were skin and bones and most of the animals were either not viewable or in sad shape.  And the ape house stinks.  So, I'm asking, should we have a national zoo?  The Smithsonian Institution is one I support wholeheartedly (mostly because I like going to the free museums), but the zoo needs a lot of work.  Is it really the government's job to do this stuff?  Perhaps we should use the dreaded p-word, privatization!  Is this yet another topic where I agree with the libertarians?  I don't think they have a position on this but I can guess what it would be.  More on that later perhaps.  (I'm shooting for at least one post a day to keep this thing from being stagnant.  Cole and Austin, please also post! Don't just comment! Give me a chance to comment.  Austin, tell us about your new school project.  Cole, tell us about your vice presidential picks and your political pet peeves.)

      I hope ya'll like the name.  I chose it because I wanted to do some play on words on "outside the box."  Something like "there is no box" or "fuck the box."  But then I realized, I'm just tired of people using these same old paradigms all the time anyway.  Hopefully this blog will happen, and hopefully my friends who are politic-y will join in.  I'm going to invite several of them.  So, we'll see.  But we run the spectrum from anarcho-tribalist to straight left-of-center progressive!  So all the important opinions are represented!  I kid.

      The libertarians have an   urlLink interesting  take on the 9/11 Commission's report  that probably won't be much  discussed in the mainstream media, of course.  They argue that the best  way to fight terrorism is to stay out of other peoples' business.  For instance, remember when we were selling weapons to both Iraq and Iran  when they were fighting that war?  Didn't that turn out just peachy keen.

      We've talked about the Presidential election, but not the Senate. Obviously, the incumbents usually sweep the election, but this year there are a lot of retiring Senators. Which seats do you think are likely to switch?    My thoughts:    For the Democrats, Illinois is a given at this point. Jack Ryan had to abandon his (trailing) campaign about a month ago, and the GOP still hasn't managed to find a new challenger for Barack Obama. Colorado is also vulnerable, given the long, drawn-out primary battle between beer magnate Peter Coors and former Rep. Bob Schaffer. (Clue to Coloradans: never vote for the guy named Schaffer! We Marylanders have experience with this.) It's been  urlLink pretty ugly .    Not to say that the Democrats aren't capable of the same thing. In Georgia,  urlLink the recent Democratic debate  played out more like a circus than an exchange of views. With a campaign like that, there's little chance of them holding on to Zell Miller's seat.    Several of the other seats are toss-ups. In South Carolina, Democrat Inez Tenenbaum has a giant lead in fundraising against Jim DeMint, and she also has the advantage of following one of South Carolina's most popular politicians, fellow Democrat Fritz Hollings.  urlLink A June poll  showed DeMint having a slight lead in the race, but the addition of Edwards to the Kerry ticket the other week could be a boost to several of the Southern races.    Speaking of Edwards, North Carolina's seat is also up for grabs. Erskine Bowles, who lost to Elizabeth Dole in 2002, is trying again to get in the Senate. He'll have an easier time this year. His opponent is Rep. Richard Burr, over whom he currently enjoys  urlLink a ten-point lead . And for you third-party lovers, Libertarian candidate Tom Bailey is also in the race.    There are several other vulnerable seats, but the last one I'll cover is Alaska. Incumbent Lisa Murkowski could be defeated by former governor Tony Knowles. Murkowski's father was the previous senator holding that seat, and when he was elected governor, he appointed her to his seat. Nepotism at work. It'll be a nice upset, to see a Democrat elected in the heavily-Republican state. (Ted Stevens, in fact, is the longest-serving Republican currently in the Senate.)    Anyone from one of these states, or other Senate battlegrounds, care to comment?

      The libertarian political convention was at least  urlLink interesting , though their candidate seems a little idiosyncratic.  Would it be good for the country if the republican or democratic nominee was not chosen until the convention?  I think it would, although it would also demonstrate the delegate system that we have always used a little more clearly.  Much like the electoral college, I'm sure a lot of people don't even know that the nominee is determined by a set of delegates.  Anyway, this is another strike *against* the libertarians, although the comments section  urlLink here  helped keep it from swaying my opinion too far toward the negative.  If this liberty unbound thing takes off, we should definitely add it to our links that don't suck section.  Can anyone else find blogs or more respectable news sources that deal exclusively with third party issues?

They've chosen New Hampshire.  But anyway, a bit of a microcosm of the Free State project has taken place in Grafton, New Hampshire, and it  urlLink hasn't gone well .  In general, I think the Free State project is a good idea.  I was excited about it when I first heard about it.  People are trying to do something to further their beliefs, change the world, even though they may not fit the dominant paradigm.  They've distanced themselves from this Free Town projects, but I recommend that they take great care to make sure they don't inadvertantly cause some sort of New Hampshirean civil war.

      Alright, I'm going to go there.  The democratic blog  urlLink Pandagon  has been ripping into Nader an astounding amount lately for seemingly no good reason.  This is quite bad form, I think.  One of the proprietors of the blog, Jesse, works for the Jerry Springer campaign for the senate in Ohio.  What he doesn't seem to understand is that many Nader votes are not likely to vote at all if there isn't someone like Nader on the ticket!  And, when Nader is a choice, they tend to show up to vote, and then they tend to vote for people in races for, oh, say, Senate.  Generally they pick populists who are interesting and think outside the box.  Sound like anyone running for Senate in Ohio?   So, basically, riffing on Ralph seems to me to be counter to Jesse's interests, and also, it sucks.  So, while I often like a lot of what they have to say, I'm going to have to add Pandagon to our list of links that suck.  Here's two examples:  In  urlLink Jesus Hates a Liar , Jesse points out that a whopping *ten percent* of Nader's money comes from Republicans.  Oh, my stars, ten percent?  In a year when he's trying to court Republican votes because Democrats are upset with him?  Yet somehow he seems to think this is bad for Ralph or Ralph's fault.  In  urlLink Officially Sold Out , under the category "That &#^$*& Nader", Ralph is knocked because the Michigan GOP is collecting signatures to get him on the ballot.  Is that his fault?  I say, the more candidates there are to choose from, the better.  I guess Democrats like Jesse and Ezra from Pandagon would prefer it if there were only two candidates on the ballot for President, both multi-millionaires from elite Northeastern families, who both favored the Iraq debacle and were both members of the Skull and Bones secret society at Yale.  Not to mention the corporate donors that both accept loads of money from.  No one else is allowed to run for President.  Or else.

      Sorry friends, I was on vacation.  Luckily, Gary and Cole filled the void with their insights.  Anyway, since  urlLink the PAT RIOT act , due to a  urlLink recent vote , still allows the government to see what I check out of the library, I might as well make it public.  So you, my friends, are going to be given the privilege of hearing about what I read on my trip!  I love it when I am reading several different types of books and they all seem to run together in my mind in a common thread.  This definitely happened last week.  I encourage you to pick up and read as many of these books as your local library carries.   Crash ! ng the Party   Ralph Nader   Ralph, two or three years after the 2000 election, justifies his participation by giving us a window into his activities of mid-to-late 2000.  The book emphasized, for me, the local nature of the Green party and its reasons for existence quite well.  It also showed me how important it is to get into the presidential debate and how the 'bipartisan' commission that controls the debates works.  From now on, whenever I hear 'bipartisan' I will read 'corporate' and I encourage you to do the same.    Bushwhacked: Life in George W. Bush's America   Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose    The authors of  Shrub: The Short But Happy Political Life of George W. Bush  return with a book about the way Bush's policies have affected the lives of people in very real ways.  Many of the stories were related to those that Ralph recounted in his book.  The book also shows the results of policies Bush used in Texas which are the very same policies he is trying to implement nationally.      Snow Crash   Neal Stephenson   In something of a parallel universe, America has gone bankrupt and sold off almost all its assets to private companies.  A samurai / hacker / pizza deliverer has to save the world from a telecommuncations tycoon and a group of religious zealots, with many interesting twists.  In the same way that Ralph steered me back toward the Greens, this science fiction book may have steered me away from the libertarians ;)    Antarctica   Kim Stanley Robinson   An assistant to a Green (well, Green turned Democrat) senator, co-op forming workers, adventurers, oilmen from chile and zimbabwe, scientists, eco-terrorists, and 'native Antarcticans' all play a part as they try to save Antarctica from the US Congress which is about to fail to re-ratify a treaty keeping it free from resource plunder.  The book takes into account many current trends, and sums up a  history of capitalism:  That it first defeated communism, then defeated democracy, and now is trying to defeat science.  "What's true in Antarctica is true everywhere."    Foundation   Isaac Asimov   The galactic empire is about to crumble and one man has an idea about how to save it.  This book makes many comments about human nature and ingenuity, and is rather clever.  It essentially argues that some forces in human history are stronger than our proclivity for violence, and can defeat it.  Among these are religion and trade, though both are imperfect.  This is the first in a very famous series that I hope to read over the coming months.    When You Drive Alone, You Drive with Bin Laden   Bill Maher   A brilliant coffee table book which uses propaganda images from the 40s to illustrate what the government *should* be telling people to do to help defeat terrorism.  Finding ways to conserve oil, ending the drug war, and doing away with political correctness are among the things he argues should be done.  I think these issues are more salient to both the Greens and the libertarians than the major parties, yet no one seems to see it.  (Bill Maher did. In Ralph's book, he talks about the support Maher gave him in 2000.)    The War on Terrorism and the Terror of God   Lee Griffith   I must admit, I didn't really read this one.  I didn't get very far at all.  But the introduction was interesting.  A pacifist Christian explains how terrorism and counterterrorism are two sides of the same coin (obvious to anyone who plays counter-strike). He says that both of them are unnecessary forms of violence, and while God is often cited to support both, a true Christian would see that claim as erroneous.  In the first chapter, the author attempts to define terorrism and comes up with something akin to "violence perpetrated against the system of the state."  An interesting definition, and one I think more people should try to understand in this era.   So, capitalism, terrorism, human struggles, environmentalism.  Things to think about certainly and all of these books give interesting perspectives on these things which I think don't fit the standard paradigm. That in itself is something to support.

      This was sent to me by my congressman a few moments ago after writing him concerning the same-sex marriage amendment asap H.J. Res. 56. Does anyone else find the "God Bless" disturbing considering the issue?  Dear Gary,       Thank you for contacting me with your views regarding the Federal Marriage Amendment.  I appreciate hearing from you.       The Alliance for Marriage organization held a press conference on July 12, 2001 to introduce a proposal regarding the Constitution and its definition of marriage.  Its purpose is to gather support for its Federal Marriage Amendment, which states, "Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman.  Neither this Constitution or the constitution of any state ... shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups."         This effort culminated in the introduction of H.J.Res. 56, the Federal Marriage Amendment, by Rep. Marilyn Musgrave (R- CO).  As envisioned, this legislation would amend the Constitution by declaring that marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman.  Furthermore, under this language, no Federal or State law could grant marital status to an unmarried couple.  This restriction would include efforts to amend the U.S. Constitution or any State constitution.         I firmly believe that marriage is a union between a man and a woman.  This definition should not be undermined as we seek to uphold the sanctity of marriage.  As a cosponsor of H.J.Res. 56, be assured that I will support it should it come to the House floor for a vote.  Please feel free to contact me again with comments or concerns on matters that are important to you.  God Bless You,  Jim Ryun

      Remember when Disney decided to drop "Fahrenheit 9/11" because it didn't want to release a "political" movie during an election year? Well, guess what just plopped out of their studio orifice?  urlLink "America's Heart and Soul" , a collection of "vignettes" of Simple Americans Living Happy Lives which reads more like a WWII-era propaganda film than an actual documentary (coming just short of a peppy narrator exhorting Americans to Buy Bonds). You know, another arm of the Republican "everything is okay, nothing is ruined" credo. Way to suck up to your corporation's benefactors, Eisner.  Okay, the inevitable caveat: I'm not saying "Fahrenheit 9/11" isn't a propaganda piece, but at least it's  obvious  that it's Michael Moore's view of the events. Every interview I've seen with him (which, admittedly, is about two), he's said so himself. I'm still not a fan of his blowhard style of punditry, but at least he's honest.

      The Republicans have recently been trying to accuse the Democrats as being "pessimistic" on the economy. This is what Kerry had to say about that...  "The administration says this is the best economy of our lifetime,"..."They say this is the best we can do. They've even called us pessimists. Well, the most pessimistic thing you can say is that America can't do better."

      Now here is an insightful view by an earlier poster:  "protests don't do shit."  There are so many reasons why your post was ignorant its hard to know where to begin. How about first off, lumping all protests together is like lumping ALL political parties together and saying "man, political parties don't do shit."  There are many different kinds of protests, comprised of many different kinds of people working for many different goals using many different tactics. Let me give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant to clarify that you were talking about short term political street protests. Even within that much more limited scope there are still a wide range of possibilities we could be talking about. What I come across most of the time when I hear people making these reactionary (and frankly socially conservative) remarks is that 1: they have little to no experience actually being at or involved with protesting, and 2: they think they know the intended goals of the protesters but in reality are projecting their own wishes for the future on the protesters and then pointing their finger when said protesters fail to live up to the critic's goals. I would say that you are dead wrong that nobody cares about protesters. Its clear by the overwhelmingly brutal police presence (every fucking time) that someone is indeed taking notice. Which brings me back to my earlier post and the point therein (which was obviously lost on you Cole): There are huge demonstrations at the rallies for both major political parties in the country and both will be met by violence from soldiers working for the government, and paid for by our tax dollars. I think this raises some interesting questions as to what the hell is going on. Back on subject, please note that I haven't even attempted to go into reasons behind the effectiveness of any tactics such as protesting/lobbying voting/etc. But I do have three questions for you: 1) Towards what ends do you think the DNC and RNC protesters 'don't do shit,' your ends or theirs? 2) What do you think the protesters' goals are? And what are your goals within the same scope? and 3) Assuming they could be used towards the same ends, what is preventing someone from, say, doing both protesting and lobbying?

       urlLink Who needs the nominated candidate anyway?   Yeah, Ralph, try to tear apart the state Green Party with the highest number of members. That's really helpful.

      It looks like the Nader campaign is foundering.  urlLink According to the New York Times , Ralph's only made it on the ballot in six states so far. Compare this to 2000, when, as the Green Party nominee, he was on the ballot in about 43 states. He's not doing any better from a money standpoint, either; a quick check at  urlLink opensecrets.org  has revealed that Nader's raised about $1.5 million so far. Quite a drop from 2000, when he managed to raise $8.4 million.  It sounds like Ralph's glory days are over. At this point, I'll be surprised if he breaks 1% of the vote.

      Of course we all heard about how George W. Bush wants to be the  urlLink ">Peace President , but what you may not know is that libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik ran ads earlier in the season proclaiming  himself  the peace candidate.   (commentary on this  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  I couldn't find an actual link to the ad, but I did see it more than once while it was out.)  What of Ralph Nader?  Of course, he devotes an entire page on his 'issues' section to  urlLink peace .  David Cobb of the Green Party  urlLink says : "I am a peace candidate, and we are running unflinchingly on that message."  And don't even get me started on the "Peace and Freedom Party."    But, for Democratic Nominee John Kerry,  urlLink Peace is Not On-Message.   So, we have 6 parties, 6 candidates, and 5 of them are talking up peace.  Which one are you going to vote for?

      I randomly stumbled upon a blog today, and the guy seems to have very few readers, and he was complaining about having no one linking to him, and I liked the cut of his jib.  I could relate to all of those problems, plus he's a huge geek.  So I figured I'd give him some interesting link text:  urlLink a great blog!!!111@   I mean, why not?   I also added him to the blogroll.  I don't know why I do anything around here.  In fact, I suck at blogging.. but Cole is getting pretty good at it.
