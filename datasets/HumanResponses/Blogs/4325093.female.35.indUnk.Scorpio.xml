      I will be the first to admit it will be a cold day in hell if the pope should ever decide to canonize me into sainthood. Besides, I don’t think the name Brenda is godly enough, sounds a little too much country and a little too much rock and roll.  I do have enough Catholic guilt instilled in my non-practicing soul to last me a triple lifetime. In fact, I believe I have a flat forehead, not from genetics, but from all the brow beating and head thumping I’ve infringed on myself over the years.  Lately, I have been waging an inner battle within myself. I have an army of little plastic khaki colored men in my brain, my heart and my soul, ½ in an aggressive stance, the other half cowering from the fallout. When I sleep, I can hear the army men tumble around inside me as I toss and turn, sounding similar to a LegoLand village being poured out of the canister.  I cannot even begin to define what is eating me, let alone explain what I am feeling guilty about except to say I almost hate someone and I do not even know this person.  Really. I have never met her. Came close on a few occasions, but luckily I have never had the pleasure of meeting someone perfect.  Opps. See, there it is, cattiness. It is coming out of me again. Time to thunk my head and move on, but god I just cannot and I don’t know why. In fact, if you were to know this long sordid and unbelievably silly story, you would probably thunk me on the forehead as well.  One day when I feel like spilling my guts I may do so. Maybe that is not such a bad idea if it settles down the infantry within me, but I need time to collect my thoughts and figure out where to start and where to finish, if there even is an ending.

       Psychologists say all of our earliest memories are located in the fourth year of life, between the third and fourth birthdays, and yet I can recall short clips of my life as early as the age of one and a half.      Having been born in Las Vegas in the late 60's, you would think my memories would be of dazzling lights or a barage of color when in fact most of the moments I recall are ones of pain, be it physical or mental.     And before you think my parents abused me in any way shape or form, the pain came from my own doing. My zest for exploration landed me smack into a cactus, and while I do not remember the actual tumble, in my mind's eye I can see and feel my mother and aunt tugging at my skin with tweezers to remove the spines.    I have other memories as well, but all are clips and images with no real story behind them, just little things my brain never purged to clear the way for bigger and better things.
