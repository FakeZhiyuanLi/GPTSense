       hey, im bored rite now. so im posting.   im prolly goin up to guitar center this week. i need a new strap, a new cord, and if i cant buy one from danny, a distortion pedal. i watched a rerun of an ashlee simpson show. its the one where she does a concert. she really sucked. there was sumthing i didnt understand abt one of her songs. before a song called shadow she said sumthin like "i love my sister i have always been there for her and she has always been there for me. and so i wrote this song." but the song's lyrics were like all i have been living in you shadow and now im free. i can get away from u. i dont understand. before it sounded like this was a song that was all like thanks for being there for me. but it turns all pissy.and then she says dont feel sorry for me. what? that doesnt make sense. and then she tripped. hahahaha. thats funny. and she looked like she was trying to get sumthin out of her hair. and trying to grab the air. hhhhmmm, insane? yes yes. and not in a good way. glanaginflabinwigenwabesalatyrenenyneenee. well g2g,    Nomekiller

       hey finished watchin the eye. it was pretty good. i like the sixth sense was better. but it was better than a LOT&nbsp;of other horror movies ive seen. i liked it better than ringu. japanese have better taste in horror. they dont really have the theory that many american horror movies have: the more nudity the better it will be. or the gruesume kills make for an excellent horror movie. i still&nbsp; want to see the grudge tho. non of the theatres around here have it. amc mite get it soon. they usually have foreign movies there. u no what i figured out last nite? i realized that i whine a LOT on here. abt "oh im having the worst adolescents EVER! feel sorry for me."   and i am going to try and refrain from doin that. i kinda sound like (*shuddershudder*) ashlee simpson. and i really dont like that. but i will still and always complaine abt ppl who piss me off. ugh my keyboard is filthy. theres a bunch of cat hairs in between the keys.&nbsp;ok now there a little better but we still need to get a new one. well g2g,   Will

       hey, its 1:00. i cant fall asleep so i thought i would bore myself ranting to u guys. well i finished stepford wives. its not that amazing that i finished it in a day. its only like 125 pages long. it was good. not wicked awesome but definitly worth reading. i hope rosemarys baby and a kiss before dying (both ritten by ira levin) are better tho. hmmm, make sure u take my new burton quiz rite below the old one. this stuff is a little harder than the other quiz. i have to start summer reading. i read 3 pages of the magicians nephew and im already bored to tears. and i dont think ne one gets killed in this one :-( thats what makes king books better than they already are; descriptive deaths. i really wanted to finish the stand before school starts but its not gonna happen. i just didnt feel as compelled to read it as i did sum other SK books. speaking of SK; a new movie based on his award winning e-short story riding the bullet will be released around halloween. i saw the trailor and it looks like it could be one of the better page to screen adaptations. also a movie based on the girl who loved tom gordon is in production. staring dakota fanning (*vomit vomit*) but directed by the one and only george romero! the talisman is set to be (i think) a mini series. um bag of bones movie has beened suggested but no script is being ritten yet. and the eye of the dragon is also a movie that is currently in pre production. im exited abt all of these. especially bag of bones. changing the subject tho. i really hate denzel washington. hes arrogent. and it always cums across in his rolls. also. his last movie that he was not sombody "who was defying the rest. against all odds (imagin that in a big intimidating voice)." was antwone fisher. or whatever that movie was.he just flat out sucks. hhhmmm, i have church this morning. thats ok. i geuss. God does deserve sum of my time since he made me and the world and stuff. oh i figured out that i will be able to buy all the dvds that i want in august. i have a dogsitting thing and i usually make abt $80 fer that and i make another $18 a week. enalbling me to buy kill bill vol 2, futurama vol. 3 and 4, king of the hill season 2, and sealab 2021 season 1. muahahaha.    i wont get much done this august. my very least favorite month (its the whole thing w/ school. im sure august is a very nice month but i really on feel the connection that i have w/ july. its not august. its me). ne ways g2g,   Will
