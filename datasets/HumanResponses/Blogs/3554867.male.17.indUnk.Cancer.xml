      God has regressed me back to a little kid. I can't explain it, but i kinda forgot all the evilness. I did so many indulganced prayers on Holy Thursday, and read the Bible with indulgenced prayers, i honestly think that helped heal me, and now i really don't even think about sex at all.  That SSA has not gone away, but I have changed in my soul to the point where i no longer desire that kind of relationship. I still find myself not attracted to girls but to boys, i could tell when i was watchin some dumb movie i didn't get excited from the girl-guy seens but there was one guy-guy seen, and yeah we'll just say i can say for sure it's still part of me. But there have been no thoughts or ideas from within me at all, my soul has been healed and i simply don't do anything bad like that because that's not what i'm made for and it never even crosses my mind! I honestly have forgotten all of my previous impure thoughts, they're gone! i prolly couldn't even bring em back up if i wanted to! it's sooo great.  it seems like i've been given an oppurtunity to start over, because basically i'm like a pre-puberty completely little kid! My soul rediscovered real innocence i think. It really caught on when i just started watching little kid movies and deciding to dream big and don't let anyone complicate things too much. I still have like knowledge and stuff, which i entrust to the Divine Will, and i read and wanna grow more in wisdom and pray to grow more in grace, but it's all so simple now.  And i wanna tell you, even though it may seem crazy, God seems to have laid out a mission for me in life, and it's Athanasia. Honestly, i don't wanna seek glory or nothing, i'm more scared to do something like this that the world thinks is nuts than anything, but the more I pray the more it seems to be God's will.  Now, with this oppurtunity to start over. I need to mature right this time. I need to get naturally attracted to girls without the use of any lust or nothing. So my prayer is that God fixes my body the way He fixed my soul, and that He sends me the right girl who I can start a family with. And with this dreaming big shooting for the stars attitude He has set me into, that family could be a royal family.  Anyway, God is so good, and anyone struggling with stuff needs to know that. Indulgences seem to be the lost treasure of Catholic Theology, they truly can heal your soul. It's time to be optimistic, dream big and go for it, and remember that it is He who leads me every step of the way.  Pax Amorque Christi to you and your families, and your friends and all your loved ones. Pax et Amor of Christ be to all of us and lead us and make us holy and pure, young innocent and idealistic to our last days. :-)

      I have to say I am quite dissapointed to wake up and realize that it is light out already, for I was hoping for some stars in the sky.  Oh well, such is summer, I guess.  The morning-- the begining of the day.  I have to say it's been forgotten by anyone and everyone, it's been traded in for the late night.  I don't understand why, though, the morning is the best part of the day!  In this daily dose of life, it corrosponds to new life and beginings, while the end is preparing for sleep and the end of another day that brings you closer to the end of your life.  I am in a morning of my life, the begining of something great I hope.  This is my time to prepare for the rest of the day, to stretch out all the sores of last night, shower off all that may have gotten on me yesterday, and begin anew.  I have been in a night for a while, a night filled with nightmares.  But this morning I awaken to a fresh start.  While I still have the same fears and temptations of the night before, my soul is rested and refreshed, ready to fight them off.  A reader of mine, well probably one of the only readers here, didn't quite understand what I meant about my "homosexuality"; how it was gone but it was still there.  I guess I can say that this full homosexuality that I had found in myself was but a long night starting when I was about 12 years old, well ever since I can remember being attracted to anything it's been a homosexual attraction but 12 years old is the best estimate I can give you, yet now all that remains are the sores to stretch out.  I am physically attracted to boys, mentally and hormonally attached to the idea of homosexual sex, but I am no longer attached to the idea of a homosexual  relationship .  I believe the attraction to that type of relationship is what most distresses most homosexuals who want to live by the Church's teaching on chastity.  Because no matter what anyone tells you, the nature of homosexual and heterosexual relationships are fundamentally different.  Being attracted to a homosexual relationship doesn't entail simply being attracted to boys, just as being attracted to a heterosexual relationship would not entail being simply attracted to girls.  It is an entire way of thinking and desiring that is fundamentally different, and I have begun thinking and desiring towards the ordered life: one with a wife and children who I have helped bring into the world, no longer one with a partner and possibly children who we have adopted.  Those are two fundamentally different desires in life, and somehow I've decided I want to take my place in the "circle of life" and desire the real one and not the man-made dreamworld of a life that is the stuff of my nightmares.  I have awakened from this long night, and I am dissapointed to find that I am still physically disordered.  Such is morning, I guess, not finding yourself cured of all of last night's consequences, but finding youself with a cleared head and an invigorated spirit and preparing to take on a new day in which you don't seek after that which your nightmares were about, but you seek after new daydreams, and look towards a new future.  Of course, like always, this may or may not make sense to you.  I am quite complicated and am sure you're not going to understand me through simply reading my shifty words.  But now it's time for me to begin this day, both the real day and the metaphorical day, in the most Holy Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.  Amen.

      Naaaaaaaaaaants ingonyama.... bagithi baba... sithi uhhmm ingonyama  I have decided that I love the movie, The Lion King. It sounds pretty dumb, but when I watched it I got a whole new insight into my life. It's kind of wierd, but now I am really psyched up about learning and growing and going somewhere in my life. Also, I found a change in my transcendent deeper level of desire that leads to relationships.   The way I see it, and I have been thinking about this and reflecting on this for a long time now, we have two main levels of desire and attraction that are responsible for romantic connections. Ever since i can even remember, both of these levels of mine have been quite disordered and out of sync with the way the world works. The one level of desire is our desire for what type of relationsip we want, for love and affection and the overal impersonal transendent desire for a relationship. The other is the personal physical and emotional attraction, which usually works to bring about the fulfillment of the transendent desire of a relationship and of love.   Anyway, as I was watching the Lion King I recognized an answer to my prayers. See, both of those levels before has always desired a same sex partnership relationship. But seeing as how I was completely unclouded by attractions watching the two cartoon lions in their budding romance, I could definitely "feel the love tonight." I believe an answer to a ferverent long prayer I made on Holy Thursday this year may have been answered. I prayed that if it be possible these attractions that rebel so much against the natural order be lifted from me. So, watching Simba and Nala with the song "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?" I realized that my transcendent desire for what type of relationship i wanted had been shifted within me without me even realizing it.   This deep desire of relationships which had always been in sync with my attractions has been completely shifted. The type of relationship I want is the type Simba and Nala had, a heterosexual beautiful natural order of union. "The world for once in perfect harmony with all it's living things" as the song goes. That's the one line that really got me. Anyway, my physical attraction is still attracted to the same sex, but I believe that it is finally just a physical thing and no longer poisons my soul from within. Now the poison to the soul comes from without, because my soul desires an ordered relationship, and any offense against that is simply of the flesh.   Same Sex Attraction in most people is not simply a desire of the flesh, but a poison of the soul from the very inside depths of it. People are not simply attracted to the same sex by their senses and their hormones, but they are completely focused and disordered in their soul to be attracted to the same sex. By God's grace and power, however, this soul is purified. It does not happen by absolution, but by indulgence. This experience has completely clued me in to a deeper understanding of the nature of the difference between forgiveness and healing, absolution and indulgence. I believe my soul has been healed, but this just opens me up to a bigger war of the Spirit verses the Flesh.   My mind has almost always been on the side of the God-created natural order of things, composing of simply my intellect. It's been outnumbered, but since it was on God's side it was prevailing over my emotions and my poisoned soul. And now, my soul seems to have had a cleansing experience. I do not know if it started after my ferverent prayers on Holy Thursday, or when I first told a close friend of mine about my same sex attraction in December, or maybe when I first started learning about the fact that I don't have to follow this in-depth attribute of myself nor did I have to live in unhealthy denial through the testimony of Hyperdulia Again and Good Friday (may God help and heal them both) when I first joined the Phorum at www.PhatMass.com. Regardless of when it started, I never realized it until I watched The Lion King.   God works in mysterious ways, so why can't He work in cartoon ways? Anyway, not only has it given me insight to what God has done to me and for me, it made me decide to prepare myself to do things well and face responsibilities. I have decided to learn as much as I can learn, read as much as I can read, run and work out as much as I can, and live a life of complexity in simplicity. That may or may not make sense, but it's quite invigorating. And this is why I have decided I love the movie: The Lion King.
