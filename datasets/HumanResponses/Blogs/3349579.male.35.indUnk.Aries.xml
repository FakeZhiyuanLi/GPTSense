      Fellas, just got my new edition of Men's Health and was reading my favorite editor David Zinczenko. There is a quote that I would like for you guys to really take to heart:  "Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at 20 or 80. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young." - Henry Ford.   Maintain youthfulness throughout life is part of my mission in life and to encourage others to do the same.  Good things for the Heart -- Check it out!http://www.menshealth.com/cda/subcategory/0,,s1-3-124-179-0,00.html

      I believe that there are 5 keys areas to life: Spiritual Relational Financial Phyical Educational  I believe that there are 3 focuses which applies to all 5 areas: Public Personal Private  Take this test and let me know where you stand: 1. Rate yourself from 0-10 (10 being the best) of where you are in each of the 3 focuses 2. After deciding on where you are now in life, then tell me if you are increasing of decreasing in that focus area. 3. Ask yourself the question: "What must I do to improve this focus."  Goal setting is key, here is something to try. Break your life into quarters:  QTR 1: Jan, Feb Mar QTR 2: Apr, May, Jun QTR 3: Jul, Aug, Sept QTR 4: Oct, Nov, Dec  For each QTR set 1 goal in each of the 5 areas and try to attain it. The Goal should be measureable and achieveable.   Well that is it for now, more to come.... :)

      Well are you ready to take this incredible journey together? I'd hope so! This is the first of many post that I will generate from time to time to encourage and build you guys into Men who are ready to take that step to The Next Level.  I am in the midst of reading Andy Stanley's Book titled, "The Next Generational Leader" and it has touched me right where I am in life; I would like to share with you guys some key points of the book.  Andy has identified five concepts that are the irreducible minimum for Next Generational leaders:  Competence Courage Clarity Coaching Character  Do you possess each of these? (I would like to have feed back when you get the chance, Post here)  In the first chapter he starts off hitting me in the gut...  In the area of Competence he says: Paul, (well he doesn't really say me but)   You are doing too much! (Does this apply to you too?)  Yes I realize this Andy and I am trying not to do so much. Since this is my first lesson, it is one I would like for you guys to hold me accountable on. Recently I have decided to make the shift from the Government world to the Private sector. I am excited but yet challenged. I am partnering with one of my small group brothers in business. Our company name is named "Infoition" and we are a Dedicated News Reporting Company providing the news that matters most to our clients. It is our desire to help decision makers -- make good decisions by being informed. The reason I tell you this, is because I am going to exercise 2 key secrets that Andy discusses in chapter 1:         1. The less you do, the more you accomplish        2. The less you do, the more you enable others to accomplish.  I believe that with all my heart. So as a result I will remain your coach. I want to encourage you in your walk, in your daily lives, and in your future growth as a individual and as men of God. I will be available via email and phone. My personal visit time will be limited these next 6 months as I am trying to help get a startup off the ground. I will need your prayers and encouragement. Sooo...with that let the fun begin shall we?!

      Why do we communicate?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. To Create a Positive feeling or Amplify a Postive feeling we are already having. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Get rid of a negative feeling &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Create a new result  Why do we want to do the above?&nbsp; Because we want to feel good! There are a couple&nbsp;things we must do: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. We need to communicate to ourselves first more effectively, then we can communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better to other people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If we are going to communicate well with others, we can't do that by making them  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrong/attacking them and&nbsp;telling them how screwed up they are.  Core beliefs about people are key: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Do not Judge people/Do not attack people - This destroys communication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Never question the intent of a person (you can question behaviors but not intent). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;People are not their Behavoirs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. There are always two sides to views on life.  Here are&nbsp;4&nbsp;questions to ask yourself for&nbsp;a reality check:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. How do I communicate when I am stressed? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. How do I get leverage when I don't get what I want? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. How do I communicate well when I am stressed? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. How can I communicate better in the future? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  All of this information was&nbsp;provided&nbsp;by a series called "Passion for Living" by Anthony Robbins and this is just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;You can pick a copy up from your&nbsp;&nbsp;local library (get it on audio) and you can listen on your drive to and from work.&nbsp;May your communication improve each day.&nbsp;
