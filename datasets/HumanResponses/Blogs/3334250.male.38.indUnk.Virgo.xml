						   You know: "what goes around comes around". There are a bunch of different flavors of it floating around in various eastern religions and echoed in the "cast your bread upon the water" of the judeo-christian tradition. The idea is that good things will happen to you if you do good things and bad things will happen to you if you do bad things. It's as if the world is a giant slot machine and if you keep pumping in your coins of goodness eventually you'll hit the jackpot and they'll all come streaming back to you. It does have a certain capitalistic appeal. One can almost imagine a cosmic accountant keeping a tally and allocating the appropriate payouts. But that's not the whole story. Karma is a wheel that keeps going around and around. It's true that what you send out tends to come back. But, more importantly, what comes to you tends to be what you send out. If someone does something bad to you it inspires a strong urge to retaliate and that is exactly what we tend to do. If we can't retaliate we tend to pass it along by taking it out on someone else. But we are not a cosmic law, blindly keeping the scales balanced. We have a choice. We can respond to evil with good. We can look into the pain behind an unkind act and respond with compassion and kindness. When we do we remove some evil from the wheel and replace it with good. Good that will keep on going around and around the wheel indefinitely. That good will probably come back to us one day, but that is not what is significant. What is significant isn't what you get, it is what you are. Changing the composition of the wheel of Karma is more than a way to transform the world. It is a way to transform yourself.

						   "Do you know what you're asking? Normal? You aren't normal. Do you want to die? That's what it would take to make you 'normal'. You'd have to become something that you're not and what you are now would be destroyed."    "I don't think that 'normal' is what you want at all. I think that you want to have your needs met. I think that you want to be healthy and that, to you, normal looks healthy. Personally, I have my doubts about that. But it doesn't matter. Healthy for a normal person isn't necessarily going to be healthy for you, but there will be some things in common. Acceptance, for instance. That's what you want isn't it. You say you want to be normal, but what I think you mean is that you want a place in the world. Well, the bell curve needs people hanging out on the ends in order to be complete. You don't happen to fall right smack in the middle of the curve. It's not your job to be normal. Your job is to give some shape to another part of the curve. A thinner part. A part that's going to be harder to find. You won't get accepted by going to the part of the curve that's easy to find and pretending that you belong there -- you don't and it's too obvious for you to fake it. The only way you could get acceptance there is to lie, and then it would be the lie that was accepted, not you. You can't be safe by shutting out the world either. You'll starve to death if you do that, and your place in the world will whither and fade from neglect. You need the world and the world needs you."    "So you see, you're just like everyone else. 'Normal' if you will. You have a place. You can get what you need. But you'll have to work harder in order to do it. You'll have to search farther than most people do in order to find your place. When you find it you may discover that you still need to grow and change to really fill that place and start getting what you need from it. You'll probably have to change and grow some more in order to be able make use of what you get. It'll be like eating a new food, you may experience some discomfort before you get used to it and start digesting it properly. Your efforts to fit in have made you something of a broken vessel. It'll take some work to get you to the right place, doing the right things and really appreciating what's there for you."     "In the mean time you'll have to start making connections to the world around you whether those connections are comfortable for you or not. You need them in order to move around and you need them in order to see where you are. It's time for you to come out of your cave. You are right that it'll be miserable on the outside, but, at this point, it won't be any more miserable than it's gotten to be in there. The difference is that on the outside you have a chance to make things better."

						   Religion, philosophy, psychology, ever think about how similar these all are to each other? They are all about the big questions: why are we here? Why am  I  here? What is important? They are all about our relationship with the world around us. For me it's the questions that are important, not the particular disciplines that try to answer them, so if my personal quest for answers takes me out of the realm of one discipline and into another it doesn't worry me too much. Neither does getting the right answers. What I want are  useful  answers.    I was reading, once, about an AI model of cognition that got me thinking about building my own model. It seemed pretty simple at first. There are only a few basic elements really: thoughts, actions, feelings, sensations. All of human experience can be neatly partitioned into one or more of those catagories. Then I started thinking about the interactions between these catagories. I wanted to model how thoughts and feelings interacted and lead to actions and how sensations provided feedback from the outside world that would alter the thougths and feelings. Pretty quickly things started to get complicated. Some of the feedback mechanisms were automatic. Memories and associations, for instance, would produce emotions almost automatically. Other mechanisms depended more on individual choices, like how to interpret the input and how it fit into or changed an existing world view. As I spent time exploring this growing knot of relationships I started to wonder how much of this stuff was being done by my brain and how much was being done by me. What is "me" anyway?     There are all of these brains in the world and they are all doing pretty much the same thing in their own peculiar ways. Except for one. There is one brain in this world that operates in an extrordinarily different way. It is my brain and it is different because it affects me. All those other brains function very much like mine except that they are not connected to me. Whatever "me" is, it is definitely real and it is definitely separate from, but connected to, my brain. Otherwise, I'd be aware of what was going on in all of those other brains too. It might seem as though "me-ness" could be an intrinsic part of the brain; that the brain could actually be aware of itself and that, as a result, I am actually my brain. That could very well be the case, but even if that theory is the truth, it's not very useful. The model it provides predicts that decisions are something that happens to me along with the sensation of having been the one to have made them. There is another theory that I am separate from my brain and that at least some of the decisions I make are not mechanical inevitabilities. This theory is more useful because it predicts that we have an influence on our destinies and that the sense of power we have over ourselves is not an illusion. Belief in this theory has lead me to living a more satisfying life. I think that most people reach a similar conclusion, although I am aware of several reasonably well adjusted individuals who have not.    This theory is essentially the belief that we each have a soul. Most of us like to believe that this soul is immortal. I do, although I can think of no reason to believe it other than the comfort it gives me. This soul, then, is connected to our brains and, through our brains, to our bodies and then to the rest of the world. This brings me back to the Big Question: why? What's the point of our souls being connected to the "real" world in this way? I have another theory. It may or may not be the truth. It does seem to be useful, but I'm not sure that it's the most useful possible. It's what I'm running with for the moment. Here it is: we're all connected to the world because it's the only way that we can get connected to each other. Your soul connects to your brain, your brain to your body, your body to the world at large in general and to other bodies in particular. That connection to other bodies leads you to other brains and, ultimately, to other souls.     I think that people tend to get stuck interacting with the world at large and all too infrequently get to the point where they are interacting with other souls. It's hard to get to that point because you have to successfully negotiate your way through the world before you can even begin to start connecting to other souls. If you can't get enough to eat, or you are addicted to some kind of drug or other stimulation, or you can't navigate through advanced primate social interactions, then you can get locked out of making a connection with other souls.     I don't know what that connection is for. Maybe it's supposed to transcend physical reality, or it's supposed to transform us, or satisfy our curiosity. Perhaps we are all supposed to ultimately come together and form some greater whole. I don't know. And maybe all of this is completely off base, but it's interesting and it's led me to some fairly satisfying life choices. So there it is.
