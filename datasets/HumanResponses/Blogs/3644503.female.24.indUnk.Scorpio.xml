      no sleep.  again.   it is hard to cop a few zzz's when you have people busting into your home at  12:30 A.M.  in a frenzy after getting into a fight at the  Fireside .... your roommate fighting with his girlfriend that  doesn't   technically  live  here until  3 A.M.  the  other  roommate making the infamous sneak-in  at  5:40 A.M.  and a phantom cell phone going off in  constant spurts  from who- knows - where  spread out within the hour between  6:50 A.M. until  8:30.  i admitted defeat at  10:30 A.M.  and  wandered down the stairs that caused the girlfriend to shut off the living room  television and  leave . i figured i would be  done  with these kinds of  dramatics when i was  17 .... 19 at the  latest  after moving out of  iowa city  and deciding that the  university of iowa  was  not  the  place to be at that moment in time.  and, i was writing in tempestuous need over these  events that  got lost  when this  damn laptop decided to freeze . the lack of sleep, shot nerves and  elevated circulatory system from my asshole habit of the amount of coffee i consume only escalated  further  into furious mania.... an  hour and a half lost  to this  piece  of  shit  getting  constipated !!?? i really don't wish to be in my  own company...i can only  imagine   everyone else's handling on my present attitude.  i am  astounded  that our government "decided" to pull a move as petty as giving Iraq over  a whoppin'  two days  ahead of schedule. it's like a jerk-off guy taggin' a  bunch  of chicks at once,   proclaiming monogamy  and  not  using protection. after a  few months  of this,  he is  forced  to admit   some  of his fault in order to decode who inflicted him with whatever STD or incurable blood pathogen he successfully contracted while boning the masses in seemingly methodical surreptitiousness. and  NOW , he decides that he  MUST  use a rubber in order to prevent any  further  damage in order to  still  get his rocks off. who cares if he lied? who cares if he is being a "good" boy now?   two days , my  ass.  the damage  has  long  been done. and  Bush doesn't anticipate pulling our 140,000 some-odd troops out anytime soon.   it's like  Britain's attempt 80 years ago  to aid in governing Iraq. yes.  the record of history is on a periodical skip.  i urge y'all to scope this site i was tipped off on:  urlLink www.votingwiththeunderground.org  quit bitching and take action.  after group rehearsal in the tundra that is   Superior Street , the vocalist for  American Motherload  asking about yours truly, (it's the tattoos.... aaaawww .... how  predictable ) my cherry was burst with the  introduction to  "The Broadway Project".  i am  always  in search for new sounds that  can detatch me from current headaches.... and this took me to a  whole new zone .  after this instigated enlightenment from joe axis,  (the man with a  million books  and   severely  extensive music library)  i  MUST  pass word about this  felicitous solo experiment from Britain.  can't keep everything furtive...especially when  it's as good as this exposure was for me last evening. with joe being friends with the man responsible for  The Broadway Project ,  i  may   get the chance to  indulge in witnessing him perform live . hopefully my introduction  won't instill me to weaken into an over-exuberant zealot. it's just great music is a challenge to ascertain anymore. i tend to get over-the-top in enthusiasm sometimes....   damn  it. my coffee mug is empty.  "  OBSEQUIOUS:   excessively respectful, servile, unpleasantly complimentary; A.K.A. oleaginous; supporters of Bush."

      a  wonderfully  relaxing evening... especially when in the comfort of people that  permit you to feel solid enough  to say whatever the hell may come to mind,  and  not  have to apologize for it later.  i had taken up the offer to hit up the   Heartland Cafe  and mingle with joe and julie.  it was a collaboration of people spending  the last few  moments before their friend mollie took her leave  to the Big Apple.  i had encountered many wonderful individuals who  had great things to talk about,  and for once, i didn't feel completely uneasy or  suffocated. no need to tap-dance and act like something i wasn't to maintain an ease in the environment.  i was floored at seeing  Trisha Star  there.... a  beautiful  girl whom i haven't spent any sort  of time with since my relocation to the  state of Illinois back in August of 2002, when i  worked the  Tattoo The Earth  convention that was thrown at the  All-State Arena   by  Paul Booth .  he's the new york ink slinger that owns  Last Rites , and has done much work on many a rock star in the metal genre....he even hit up the boys of  Slipknot ... (the ridiculously insane costume-wearin' unstocial million member band from my homestate. funny how they named such a heavy duty album after one of the most  vacant  spaces in the country....)  trisha had to do a double-take....since the last time we saw each other, i had a  shaved head  and she had  multi-colored extensions . for a  change , we both had our  own  hair... ha.  weird  how hair changes a person's appearance so drastically to  the point of unrecognizable. but, she is one of my  favorite  people  i have  ever  been introduced to...i hope that our re-introduction after  two years  of  change  and  absense can pan out to a great, solid friendship. check out her site at   urlLink www.trishastar.com.   she is an amazing person.  for once, i have nothing to really bitch about or feel like analyzing.   yay!  simply reporting a  decent  evening... figured since that it's  still  somewhat of a rarity of having non-stressful moments, i better jot it down!  when i got home after reaming the topics involving political matters and things that aggrivated whomever contributed in the conversations about this crazy planet, i watched some mind-numbing programming on  Adult Swim .  very  odd that i am getting hooked on  3 A.M. television after not watching  any  sort of t.v. for  four years ..... but i can't help but love  Home Movies ....

      i must say, kudos, props and a thanks  for the nice comment from   "Slash" , for his full-fledged support on my enthusiasm for metaphorical excrement.  dig it.  it's all natural.  even though we all may be unique with the ways of passing....as well as complications with the consuming and passing....the digestive system can be  a demented model for life.... some more gassy, solid or fluid.....some not able to handle things as well as others can.....some in need of supplements to work properly.... it makes us all relatively equal.   just like the grave.   well!  after a day of photoshooting for the  lovely sweet boy that claims he's 37.... Keith,   (who  just  had a  successful  showing of his film at the  Gene Siskel Theatre ! way to GO!!) at the Lava Lounge....  i was permitted to reflect and finally snag a bit of  a level-head. so, for a few hours, i traded in my emotionally saturated mentality....for a   nice  change of pace.   i was then capable to disinter, distinguish and accept some things that have  held me back from so much...  and  finally  omit  some of the nostalgia that was doing  nothing  but  carving me open slowly with  every   passing day and month for the last long,  confusing  transitional year.  i feel that i can be  much  more audacious,  without being petrified at making more felicitous decisions.   "about fucking time,"  i can hear some say now....   i have no time for painful, murderous love ....and need to  respect   that these three tend to  travel hand in hand in their sadistic, yet appealing triumvirate. i gotta be comfy under the nimbi by myself before offering to share any space.   ahhh,  fuck it . ignore this rant. it's just another hopeless romantic whining again....   YES!   Michael Moore is rockin' the country again....i think it's funny to  hear the ones that this movie  infuriates  exclaim that Moore is loose with the truth,  and is doing nothing more but  "distorting the facts to make it  fit and support his argument." sounds like an everyday run of the mill politician  move, if you ask me. kinda the same reasoning as to why we are in a dumb war anyway,  that is doing no one any good except pissing alot of people off....and causing our own country's citizens to begin fighting against each other....let  alone  overseas  with  people who want our country to butt out. he even goes on to bash both sides of the fence....  how the Democrats VOTED for the war as well,  instead of challenging the Supreme Court's decision  to anoint Bush....and ignored many who  questioned the Florida elections....mainly the black congress members.  i also continue finding the ridiculous  battles over who is stupider and  REALLY  "telling the  truth ."  like, the book:   "Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man"??  that book, ironically,  was published by  Regan Books .... the  same  publishing company that  published    MOORE'S book: "Stupid White Men."   i suggest dropping in on this site:  urlLink www.michaelmoorehatesamerica.com  perhaps share your viewpoint, whether you agree with anyone or not... and pass it along to those who take that minute for such things.  corporations and right-wingers  this   overly paranoid of the world viewing this flick is  suspicious enough as it is .... trying to tag moore as being a redneck idiot is even  more  disturbing,  since that  seems to be their only solution  thus far.... and is displaying a  huge  example of censorship  and attempt in silencing  our own people,  when we deserve nothing BUT the truth.    "let my own lack of a voice be heard."   " GENUFLECT:   to bend at the knee and lower the body; especially in worship."  in my attempt to recall the correct spelling of this word....i found it a bit twisted that it was in direct line after the words  GENTRIFICATION  and  GENTRY ...and, with an  extra  dose of satire.....the word  GENUINE  ended this odd line-up.   huh.

      i was e-mailed recently by an individual that expressed their aversion towards my  remorseful viewpoints on the vast majority of  people. i guess i was giving off musky fumes that signaled my  supposed effigy that screamed   "I FEEL I AM BETTER THAN EVERYONE!"  to this particular subject matter that noted this understandable but  heavily  inaccurate analysis.  now, to  ease  this baffled accusation, when i say that i tend to "forget"  about most people i encounter.....except for the  ones that  "spark something and  causes intrigue" ...that is  not  me confirming  that i am some superior judge of character, nor am i allowing  anyone to assume that i feel that i am the  definition of  perfection  and  bigger  than everyone i meet. believe me,  people from my past that have sparked that "interest"  weren't  always wonderful individuals to get caught up in. how could i be caught up and absorbed in confidence that  isn't there  to presume i can read  anyone  like a book!??   silly heads .  and those i have run into now that  caused my eyebrow to raise  in slight curiosity have managed to  stay  along  that level....i'm still learning to be a bit more  conscientious  when opening up and evolving a sense of trust.   but, i  have  found, through trial and error,  living and learning...that   most people do suck some serious ass ; i find it all to be  depressing .... not   something i  love  boosting my ego on. hell, i have my good side, evil side and the side that  is completely indifferent. as stated in an earlier entry...  no one  is blameless. i just get  so casuistic  with my attempts in understanding behaviors that i cannot grasp.... no  wonder  everyone tells me to "hey, c'mooon.  relaaaax , girl!"  (the sentance reverb sounds like  saddam  portrayed in a  South Park  episode ....)  but, i  will  say, i  have  been doing  much  better. as many of my close friends have continued suggesting,  i have decided to treat such accusations made  by the ones that won't bother regaining the facts as expressions of supercilious jealousy. and jealousy is one of the  biggest  wastes of time  ever.    so, i will take their covetous words and butter my toast with it.... cause goddamn it!!!!  toast is fucking  good , and lathering my hunks of toasted concepts with these pats of envy in sinful amounts  to consume in all in juicy melted crunches, swallow, digest and poop it all out, wipe, flush and forget  all about it.... is  the  most  satisfying  movement i have come to know.  alot better than  staring  at it....letting these  words flaunt, tease, torment, and eating  ME  by  putting up with it being there.  it's just the fuel needed to keep this shit flowing.   i will now leave with me jacked up on  good  coffee....   " man!  this is some serious  gourmet  shit!"  "shut up... i  KNOW  how good my coffee is. alright?"   yeah...after my stomach, which i am  sure  is developing a  million ulcers slowly, couldn't handle the garbage grounds that  kevin likes, which  isn't  shocking since he chugs  Old Style  and  PBR .....he went and surprised me with  a whole pound of ground  Caribou Blend . i prefer to support the mom and pop shops around my neighborhood and supply myself with delectable coffee from my nearby Caribou. (starbucks?...nooooo) if i can be a  snob  with  anything .... it would be my  coffee, tea and alcohol.   the three main food groups. although,  this self-proclaimed vegetarian  loves  Meatwad ..... and would cook bacon for  anybody .... since i know any dietary decision is by educated choices.... hardly   by  instinct  anymore.  one of my favorite words: "  INCOMMUNICADO:   not allowed, or not wishing  to communicate with others ."

      i was  poorly  mistaken by miscommunication. the funeral is  today ....  not  tomorrow, as believed. kevin came in all exhausted last evening and mentioned that  it all is happening "so fast." she had a healing tattoo on her arm by tim done a week ago..... another bitter reminder of how quick this all is. i felt even worse that i got her  final resting day incorrect. kevin was just as shocked  over the rapid time lapse...  everybody, give your friends and those dearest to you a  huge  hug and a notion of appreciation today. take a  SECOND  in your self-indulgent whirl-wind schedules, and say a few "i love you's"  just for the fact that it's  true .  to all of my best near and far, those who have passed, from the antiquity periods, and those i have yet to encounter:  my life hasn't been my life without your company, presence and contributions .   whew!  gettin' all serious.... time to toss in a bit of humor. okay, now.... since i am  filthy  broke, i haven't really been able to swing effort towards any form of  groceries for a little while. living somewhat apathetically, (for there isn't any way to better a situation by  freaking out ,) i manage to keep the ball rollin' with eight varieties of tea,  brewin' shit-instant coffee that is typically found in those little local diners on seedy corners in questionable neighborhoods, and a food group that  many would stick under the category of  "condiments."  i am tormented with the new chinese restaurant next to our house....we get some mighty  good fragrances finding it's way  through open windows, pumped up the nostrils and causing the  stomach cavity to announce it's  well-known vacancy. now, during an attempt to be creative with an ancient box of risotto, vegetable oil, tap water, minced garlic and seasoned salt the other evening after i refused to consume popcorn for the third day in a row...something struck me as being  another  demented aspect of this  backward nation.  i find it to be  unreal  that there are  willfully emaciated celebrities ...and people like me and most i choose to mingle with that have lack  of immediate options to have enough to even buy a gallon of milk. and some of you have already read my tangent  on  that  matter. so i won't drag it out any further here.  but, i  refuse  to sob over a  starving millionaire .  on other matters, last evening,  Comedy Central  posed a familiar face for this household. during the  "conservative punk" discussion  on  The Daily Show  with  Jon Stewart  the guy  brandon kelley  that was interviewed  had been involved with both of my roommate's circle of friends "back in the day." i encountered him once, i think. maybe twice. i dunno.  some people i've been introduced to tend to melt together with everything else after a while if they  don't strike me immediately. they were  sure  to tape the second showing.  i have to remember that the music world is just like any other clique or organization...seemingly vast and confident, when in reality, it's small and introverted. the specific leaders of the packs, those that are the most...ummm.... lack of a better term here....  "popular",   get ego-boosts constantly blown up their asses by those that willingly follow with tongues hangin' and tails waggin'  furiously behind each and every butt-kisser.  about as bad as religion.  i was  more  than happy with watching  Lewis Black   bust out a few good ones over the campaigning going on between the republicans and democrats.  Hunter S, Lewis B, the late Hicks  and others that bash  political strings.... "these are a few of my  favorite things...."   ***FAHRENHEIT 9/11 OPENS TOMORROW.***    NO EXCUSES.  ATTEND THIS MOVIE.   and now.... "  EGREGIOUS:   outstandingly bad; shocking; severely surprising."    how some  have  and  will  describe  Michael Moore's  historically groundbreaking flick being  unleashed Friday, June 25th, 2004 .

      yes..." JEREMAID:   a tale of sorrow, disappointment,  a complaint; a tirade."   the word of the day kicks off this still rather sophomoric blog. the paragraphs are being  initiated with this word passed along by one of my best comrades  Erica.   ( BTW:   she rocks , completely amazing, one of the most intelligent women i know, i tattooed her first two tattoos in one session, true  to her convictions and  not  afraid of saying so, introduced me to the group known to a few as  Clutch  during a  crazy weekend  in the snowy depths of  Michigan in February ....but, another story entirely)   the word is  very  fitting.  especially for the past few days that have come along, all taking on the disguises of nebulous forms... indiscernible periods and moments that can be placed, nonetheless, in the elite category of  "milestones"...   hazy and rapid in advancements from the start to the finish, simply because they  are  too overwhelming  for the system to take in and fully ingest when it  actually  occurs. and half the time, my poor head is ready to blow  completely  off of my sore and knotted shoulders with thoughts and worries about shit i cannot control.... but  continuously  adjust and adapt and  hope to execute my decisions as judicious and honest as possible.  the ultimate ideal destination hasn't changed. the journey and settings can't help but fluctuate and morph, though.   yes ....i was attacked the other evening.  yes, i am "okay."  i would  love  to be as jovial as possible with these topics, but  so many other black letter days had followed.  kevin got rear-ended the same night i was jumped. a  friend of mine was shipped to Iraq on monday.... can't help but be a bit petrified, considering i already lost a friend last year to this  supposed war that has been "over" for near a YEAR ....  an acquaintance of mine and a co-worker of Kevin's  at  Deluxe Tattoos  was  killed  by a  hit and run  accident over the weekend. on saturday evening, to be exact. she was in a coma and brain-damaged, which translates to  "no hope whatsoever."  kevin left for the wake an hour ago. (i had to tie his tie for him.) she was  slightly  older than me.... not as old as most of my friends. just a nasty and terrible reminder that  we are not invincible by any means.  her funeral is this friday.  i felt  completely  debilitated....i wished i could have  molded my words into  some  form of  structure that could have been detected as a comforting attempt. i could only shake my head and bite my lower lip  on occasion as i messed with his silky beige tie. i had lost yet another close friend of mine a little over a year ago after he got behind the wheel when drunk, which he  NEVER  did.  Shawn Schutter   was the only one killed that May night last year....  i  still  haven't been able to erase his email  address from my list of contacts....  and, my younger brother jason... ( not  the golf whiz... adam  is the  youngest ... jason  the  middle , and i lead the heard with tomboyish elocution) well, THAT boy announced that  he is  ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED . what.... me   flip out  and  keel over   in  spasms ?? only because i couldn't even  imagine  being pinned down  right now...  "i don't need no ball and chain...."  and naturally, with that news comes more news of people i have graduated with reproducing still and remaining exactly  where they grew up.   the  remedy  for  this ?  roll the eyes, shrug the shoulders, and just focus on my shit.... the only sure fire way from keeping  that already unstable head  on .  while seeking a payphone yesterday downtown, i actually was in  a place.... Clark and Division , where having permanent dermagraphics goes  beyond  the point of getting  the disapproving curls of upper lips that have probably witnessed it's fair share of Botox needles.   nononoooooo .... THIS  is the place where you actually become  COMPLETELY INVISIBLE.  i apparently blended with the customer service desk at the  Jewel  placed in such a  strange  area of convergence.... the well-to-do aging housewives with the husbands that pull in hefty paychecks with the meaningless  positions to fill in the voids and ignore the apparent clashing with the  ones just  trying  to keep their heads up while their  possessions are tossed onto the street of Michigan Ave....  their kids off to the side, stumped as to why they no longer have a roof over their heads... (joe witnessed this while coming to save me) yeah. my disposition was altered and mended  when i went to band practice.   joe humored at my  "salty"  mood as he picked me up  from the  Dunkin Donuts  on that corner... i just can't appreciate any form of ignorant conjectures that i am more than likely some form of a  punk rockin' diabolical concubine of a  burn-out   ex-con ...both of us trying to lay off the smack fighting the custody of our seven illegitimate kids, living on foodstamps  with six other relatives in a two bedroom apartment.  c'mon.... we are  all  probably  equally  fucked up....  we just have different methods of coping with the bullshit.   hell, i just displayed my hints of being hypocritical sometimes... i just assumed these two hags that cut in front of me yesterday  have had botox injections and husbands that bring home the bacon. ha.  noone  is immune or blameless.  i actually  signed  a few cd's last night at  our  JUTE  promo thing last evening. i am  not even on  that particular one! kinda weird....amusing, but  definitely  a weird evening.... but i will write about that another time.....

      she shook. breathing hard...the only form of movement emitted from the typically hard-to-tolerate energy that literally seeps from her skin. the pseudo-masochistic garrulous-when-comfortable pacifist is  nothing more than a silent weeping heap upon the cold concrete.  she hears someone ask if she's "alright". wiping her nose.....grabbing her pulsating head, a knot already growing rapidly, she looks up at a car with an expression of concern semi-distinguishable on the face in the driver's seat. the near blackness of the early Saturday morning and her disorientation making it all the more unbelievable. befuddled as the soreness begins to spread from her thighs, her  tailbone a burning spot that usually goes  unnoticed in day-to-day passing.    the assault made her body a difficult thing to navigate.  she pulls herself up, anyway.  what other choice is there.   coaxing the invisible strings attatched to move her limbs with her vehement will, spatting out the distinguishable coppery flavor of crimson bodily fluid upon the place she had been thrown against, she thuds her suddenly heavy legs towards the aid of the nameless one. "just take me up to Irving and Ashland....thanks. i am fine," she said to the  figure that (thankfully) didn't feel the need to put her in any worse position.  (she  still  can't believe that she took another  risk entering a foreign vehicle.)  where did her friends go to? where were they at instead of meeting with her like they said they would? now, some stranger's hands would be burnt in the form of  bruises upon her lower back... the palms and thumbs could be outlined. she would be able to inspect them in a few hours. his nails leaving a few raised welts. her pants ripped. her confidence as well...receiving yet another blow. his fingers could be detected as well  around her slender neck.  she enters the house...hearing a television on.  the anger builds out of nowhere.  unexpected, fuming and headed up the stairs,  the physical pain shooting up her entire core as each step is tackled with  the frightening resurrection of strength she wished she had to ward the aggressor off of her.... would soon be fighting off another one.  her former necessity layed out upon his bed,  and immediately threw verbal  defenses against her infuriated and crazed expression. she couldn't even take the chance to get a word out....jaw open and hanging in awe, more tears managing to swell again in the dehydrated ducts.... she retaliated by throwing the fan. he lunged and began pushing her out his bedroom door.  restrained again for the second time that night, she refused to submit....  screaming and throwing punches and kicks  furiously again. a tiny fist landing upon a mouth  she used to smother with her own. more bruises scattered upon her translucent skin,  the brusque scuffle  would be even more shocking than the first. she fights against the second body that pinned her down under the roof she rests her head. the kinetics taking her nowhere,  a sobbing writhing creature that would have to hold her  head up alone, regardless, after it all was over.  finally, she wails in defeat....confessions spill on both ends.  two days later,  her body still sore, her only remedy is new music.  polly jean  growling, whispering, calling,  humming and taking her away with the English girl's erratic melodies and severely accurate lyrics in lullabies sang by her waifish savior... some of pj's words make her blush as if being exposed herself. she keeps  "uh-huh her"  on constant loop. borrowed literature from her friend's  golden mine of a personal library to flood the memories with knowledge.  drown the fact  that she was handled like a  lathe .... again.  "  LATHE:   a machine used for holding and turning   pieces of wood or metal as they are worked ."

      really, an amusing  twist of events as i reflected while i  picked at my cuticles and bit my nails last evening....  i had recalled a moment last friday evening as i headed to the neighboring bar next to my house. kevin and i had returned from the   Subterranean  gig that my friend played. he threw a glance over at me, one hand on the caddy steering wheel, the stereo bumpin' some Detroit emcee  ( noooooo ... not  the blonde wonderboy) during the trek home,  and mentioned that he was "rather drunk".  i asked to take the wheel....my condition no better,  but have directed a car before in much worse conditions. he's so funny to watch get  a little buzzed....his equilibrium gets thrown all outta whack... but in this surreal slow motion sway kinda way. i dunno how he holds that head on straight sometimes.  that poor willowy cutie is built like Jack Skellington.... ( danny elfman  interlude: "  the Pump-kin Kiiiing !")  we made it okay. we managed to take our semi-sloppy gaits through the alleyway, up the front stairs,  through the door and into the house. we dodged my two cats, who were happy to see us... them wanting to display their affection by butting their small heads against unsteady legs and feet, bobbin' and weavin' through limbs carried by the rather intoxicated duo.  he retired to his room.  i grabbed my keys and i galloped out the door again,  continued along through the alleyway, little nutcase giggling to herself  in a black sundress with small maroon flowers and boots (right?!  me  in a  dress ....!!) to enjoy a moment of a rare good mood. slight drizzle and distant lightning set off the orangish hue of the streetlights....trust me when i say i did  NOT  need another round, but was too hyper to  zonk out, and figured i would tag a last call somewhere. i entered, with slight contempt, into the rather unusually packed bar. " what  in the  hell  were  all  these  people   doing  in  my  space??!!"  the iddy-biddy back-of-the-skull bitch of mine  interposed through the  shouts of laughter, all amplified by buckets of the liquor and beer that had been consumed  long  before my arrival.  this is the night a bombed amateur palmist  took a look at my worn and beaten right hand after her  old high school reunion male counterpart had been  asking if i had "anyone to go home with that night." i had assured him i  didn't  sleep with anyone around or older than my own parents age... with my parents being the ripe young age of 43...this leaves  my already slim-pickin's even more so. she went off over my "physical beauty"....i soon tuned her out, since i  don't find many people to be all that interesting, especially  when there is the non-intentional  reciting of the  same conversational trash  i get  everywhere . asked again about my decorated left arm.  i always have to remember that to the  majority of anyone , i am a prime choice cut,  a supreme stereotypical "fuck the world, i want attention" visual. the ones that know me best are  fully aware that i  wouldn't  even have  any  form of ink stains anywhere if they weren't done by a  well-crafted artist ,  in my case, kevin starai.  (which is  disgusting  in how difficult it is  to  FIND  a "gifted" tattooist.   ANY  monkey can learn to tattoo.... it's who takes it to that next level...) anyways.... back on track....  she basically said that her analysis determined that i am  to "live a short, unmarried life." "look on the bright side...you are  gorgeous  in the face!"  was her slurred words of comfort after feeling my "gorgeous" face fall a bit. well,  some  of you can celebrate this good news,  right ?  they soon headed off, and that's when i noticed the guy  sitting to my left...with a black t-shirt whispering the words of  Bob Dylan : " You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows ." we struck up a quick convo,  me noting that i drop in the place when it  isn't so chaotic....him agreeing as he broke from his  "Factotum"  novel...which  encouraged a few more exchanged words.  i recalled all of this last night after watching   "The Weather Underground"  for the second time.  highly recommended ..... it's scary to really know that history is only  eating and repeating itself right now.  earth serpent(s). world snake(s). everyone guilty proclaiming innocence.  and now i come to the  "Donkey Bong."  check out one of my fave links:  urlLink www.joecartoon.com  you will find Supah Fly, small creatures in blenders... and all sorts of demented juvenile redneck hillbilly humor. boost the I.Q. a bit....or knock it down a few points.  it could be one or the other for some of you. and even more good times:  "Make America Laugh".   the cynical genius that is  David Cross  has  medicated me for yet another early A.M. moment of solitude.  with all of this encouragement on silliness and humor, i leave you with the contradicting word of today: "  APOPLEXY :  informal definition of extreme anger ...  or reference to a stroke ."

       holy hell .... my little brother Adam...the youngest of our brood of three, turns the age of 21 today....the moment everyone tells you  it's "all over from this day on." hey, he's got his head screwed on just right.  i love telling everyone how fucking awesome he is at  golf . and, naturally, the reaction's of most people when viewing me in the flesh.... "golf" being emitted from my mouth is one of the least expected four letter words i could be allowed to say. seriously, he's really damned good.   i believe if you are passionate about something...be it your cell phone, (which, i am proud to say, have been weaned from one for  over a year now) gardening, dancing,  playing an instrument, writing a letter... (although  NO ONE  does this anymore....Illiteracy  continues to climb...anyways....) backgammon, chess, hopscotch, doing shots, driving a vehicle, tattooing, wearing a business suit or even a goddamned sport...and it  isn't  for money,  or some sort of  "title"  you get to  ride out  and  flaunt  for a couple a years...until the authorities say your expiration date has arrived,  schmoozin' to people you will  never  care about, shaking hands when you'd rather be home just chillin'..... and  how many of us  will  realistically  be remembered in  less than 100 years  from now anyway...?? i say  do it , and do whatever "it" is without giving a shit over  other's opinions.  we suck on those pacifirs worse than any other culture on the planet.   opinions  are like  assholes ....everybody has 'em,  and more often than not, they stink and need a cleansing.  my brother has pro-am sniffing him out....that is amazing to me, since i am not skilled, nor care to be good at any form of organized... well, "sport" in this matter. and, in turn, he is astounded at my abilities....he couldn't draw or sing to save himself...and he doesn't care to be great at these things, either. if we were all dexterous at the same thing....uuugghh... granted that most everyone dresses the same...and listens to the same music, and watches the same television, and buys the same cars, and has to have the latest whatever's...   huh.    i guess i was trying to say that this world would be a humming systematic machine with everyone going through the motions like a bunch of wanna-be dopplegangers. in truth,  it already is .  if  only  we could eradicate the expectations we pressure and place upon ourselves with  little  to  no satisfaction  in the end... i wonder how much happier everyone could be when they just   tap into themselves and live for simply that ... and  the ones they love and can't live without ?  then again, what the hell do i know....  an acquaintance of mine invited me out to a show he is attending at the Metro tomorrow evening...if you haven't received the word yet, i suggest maybe checking it out if you have no other shindig to make an appearance at. show is at 6 P.M. for those of you out in Chi. if anything...scope the website:  urlLink www.molemen.com   the word of today is: " PANJANDRUM:   a mock title for an 'important' person.

       uuuuuuugggggghhhhhhh........   this  is what happens when a  24 hour  sleepless stint strikes again.  the danger zone of my mentality creeps even futher to  making estranged comments, some strictly  "prima facie,"  due to the cloudy-headedness brought  upon by sleep deprivation....comparable to the sensations felt  during that anxious moment right before the walls begin to melt....   why am i on such a merciless schedule? hmm...after an encouraging group rehearsal with my recent stellar finds in the two human beings joe and julie axis, we went and scoped out the  Lava Lounge  (where our group  "Jute"  will vogue for promo purposes....) and expressed all of our agreements in cogent conversations over a variety of subjects.  i was treated to a new concoction....Bacardi Razz and rose-hip hibiscus tea on ice. i felt all spiffy....the drink gave me an intellectual buzz that kept me  rattling off until my normal four in the A.M. i am certain that the Axis's didn't mind. they only had to handle me for a few hours....but my fervent self-inflicted asphyxiation with another individual had  him cringing in a corner.   my millionth time to beguile the emotions of another soon became a weak emphatic attempt that only lead to the success of me  sobbing until three hours ago in my room. i feel like i have the worst hangover....head pounding....eyes swollen, puffy, dry and sore....my insides a mess....my heart similar to the termoil left by most mass killers  after a passionate slaying.  it's flattering that many think i am younger by my outward appearance. the song and dance would be completely different if it was possible to turn the insides out....every small and strapping young lad in a boy scout uniform would always insist that a "little old lady like me could use help getting across the street". then again....i'm sure i could receive similar treatment if standing at the corner of Roscoe and Halsted......  so, let's make up for all of this crap with a few  comprehensive  thoughts: hell hath frozen over, certainly. i mean, shit. the pistons WON...and Detroit is  still  standing... well, "standing" being a semi-operative word here. i have always called my dad's hometown "the land of the humbly depressed"....  announced today that quantum physics took a "leap", and rather literally. the  physical characteristics between atoms have been successfully exchanged and transported ....think along the lines of "beam me up, scotty."  some wild news, right??  come oooon....it was  JUST  announced today that there  IS NO LINK TO IRAQ/SADDAM AND THE AL-QAIDA.  and there will  STILL  be  SHOCKWAVES  in this nation over this obvious newsflash???  i  love  the sound of the right-winger gasp as they hustle (and grip strongly upon their "hard-earned" and cashed-in support) the reasons as to why Bush "still kicks ass." believe me, i have been buttin' heads with more than half of my blood-relations.  don't delay! invest in your Bush toilet paper roll today! wipe out that closet misogynist in  real  two-ply fashion!  Turkey will now be  ACTIVELY AIDING  Iraq  in their reconstruction to democracy. do i even dare ask where all of this can go???  and now, i leave again, with the word of today: "  BILLABONG : Australian term for  "BACKWATER" , which is defined as:  unaffected by progress, stagnant, stays the same; portion of a river that doesn't change since the current doesn't reach it. "  why in the hell anyone would sport that as a kick-ass name brand is an even further confirmation on most people's intelligence.

      oh....  how  hilarious is  this ??! i pondered this for a couple of days after the multiple suggestions  stemming from many a reliable source to  create this newborn "blog".....am i REALLY doing this right now? as one of many an elder i admire,                                                       (i will shamelessly regurgitate many other's  words here on this recently devised, one in a  trillion  blogsites) have put so eloquently, and many times:  "You bet your ass I am!"   naturally, most of my relations find many that i hold admiration for to be  nothing short of lascivious. in this case,  Robert Evans ....i wouldn't hold that presumption against anyone  that would rather send me psalms via email than a "hey, hon! how are you holding up out there in that sea of people swimming to their material destinations?"  i guess, this being my first post  ever , i better apologize to  anyone that stumbles across this that i do go off.... for a  long  time.....never flinching once to "waste time" in proper punctuation....and will probably forget to spell-check, or remember that  i may ramble into thoughts that some would consider appalling, confusing, perhaps even worry a few...more often then not,  "altered" in some way shape or form. i worry myself on most days. this is not an admittance of weakness.  just a fact i know about myself. i say this, since i am certain that people i would like to believe i know fairly well may be taking a moment to read some of this garbage.  i tend to roll my eyes over my own words, and that's over the discourses that  DON'T  leave my head in a terrible, wrecked up mess of unanswerable crossword puzzles....half the time screaming to myself via my hands fingering the home row keys in trying to get the thoughts out   JUST ..... RIGHT ....and sending the massive pile of words to each person that probably filter the compost heap straight to the trash can.  although, i am sure the conception of this blog  is relieving to  most ...since i will no longer be clogging their inboxes with another four in the morning  panic attack in the form of grappling texts.... poems cavorting with themselves to the level of too obscure for anyone to grip fully by their hands and dance to any comprehensive rhythm.  (sorry to the ones grinning over that   blatant habit of mine.....)  my explanations usually need explanations....and pretty soon, even  i get consumed in the thought...leaving it dead in the water after a while. there is only so much air one can breathe into a  rotting concept, even though our culture is attempting to thrive on  ideas that haven't carried a pulse in decades. i certainly am no martyr of anything.... shit, i am subversive at best... and that's on a  GOOD  day.   well! not bad for a first time entry....i think. i will be focusing on posting my attempts at poetry, which, incidentally is being developed into an actual publication by late next year called  "Catastrophic Wrecks."   maybe someone somewhere will put it to good use when it is thrust into actual existence. if anything, i am sure many a thrift store will find a use for it to fill up a space in a fifty cent-pile. i will pass along books or flicks i found to be intriguing....or had caused something to spark a few moments of lucidity...or were simply entertaining. like...if you  STILL  haven't seen  "Waking Life"  ....get with the program, and  don't  visit  this blog written by this "nobody" again until you have.... at least twice.  ;-) i will pass along information that is impacting us as a whole,  yet most choose to escape it.  ESPECIALLY THE LADIES .....honey-bunnies. i have some severe news to spread involving breast cancer.....this is a huge issue for me, since i have a grandmother  giving her all in fighting off a very aggressive form. and how  the rate of girls under 18 getting breast enhancements  for   GRADUATION GIFTS  has  GONE UP BY 300 PERCENT . what the hell happened to  self-acceptance  and  priorities ??  it's been a love/hate relationship, full of divorce and reconciliation  between me and my America. she is a whore....a picturesque, charming, sweet-talking,  full of the false promise, buried moral, and back-stabbin' whore. i keep telling her that this is all signs of de-evolution. she will ostracize me continually....i find it to be refreshing.  but, i do have my days where i am rather needy  and need her supercilious cold-shoulder to lean up against.  like Linus and his blanket..... a junkie and his syringe..... me and my gallons of coffee and whiskey sours.  i leave you with the word of today: " SCHADENFREUDE :  the enjoyment of other's misfortune ."

      "yes" are the three letters thought. breathing in the calm and  taking in the acceptance straight into the uneasiness. seeking the calm without effort. crawling upon knees until  maimed and lacerated. what else can one do after misplacing the motions, the routines, the  familiar and comfortable. how to even perform a basic walk unassisted... "yes" was the only word of comfort that apprehension finally got delivered as the promising answer.... for it was the only one available to accept. dragging now, directing the body  across the floor and to the new door. asked if any hand was needed or necessary. "no" were the two letters this time emitted from the cracked and parched lips longing to be drenched... but the drought shall insure it's presence for a while longer. parched from dehydration,  skin cracking and flaking from  malnutrition. "yes" was the word in the backseat of the skull...for pride had bullied and shoved it back  into that corner. sore... throbbing.... starving... needing.... the doorknob turns..... breathing calmly to face the  environment behind the door.... and embrace what awaited upon the other side.  blahblahblaaaah....completely  BURNED  researching  topics with financial situations to  the point of my eyes bleeding from the sockets. i am SOOO lusting for a break right now.   there are drunk fratheads in the alleyway currently... one chick is yelling to someone on her  cell phone....kinda like tourists.... the  "i'll-be-understood-if-i-YELL-and-talk-SLOWER"  syndrome. in her case, she was just  a sloppy-ass drunk giggle-bomb.  gulpin' down some chamomile tea... recalling a few sick comments made by a few walking wanna-be buttplugs when picking up  some things at the grocery store....  finally feeling the body collapsing....and for once, there is  a small peace of mind.   Blue Moon Today....July 31st.

      "No  wonder  everyone drank beer. Looking over the beer tent&nbsp;at her less than frequented neighborhood watering hole, stirring a rather timid-in-price whiskey sour... she couldn't help but feel her jaw drop open a little while skimming the list.  This&nbsp;habit has been&nbsp;noted when she snapped from the unconscious zones she wandered into many times in a day. Thank god no drool has been found yet. For a canned shit-domestic, one could fork over a measly two bucks. She assumed that a chaser would cost more than  the beer.....she is&nbsp;an expert on many things that held no pertinance in long-term happiness. Take that back....if she was drinking anything.....the beer would be the chaser....pussies and their watered down Old Style....the Schlitz.....the fascination with  crap in this overabundant society. The "real" people settling for the lowest forms of&nbsp; the whatevers.   Now that she had let her gaze wander down the list like a man  sizing up a pair of well-shaped hips, she noticed that the pocket could suffer when having a snobbish palate for a bottled import. She sucked on her straw....swallow the fimiliar sweet-tart of Southern Comfort and sweet n' sour....and her eyes landed on the check-busters. "Melbourne Brothers Strawberry" and "Frambois-Peche." Eight bucks a head. For her...that was equivalent to twenty-bucks a head. "What a crock.....it's just fucking BEER," said the whiskey that tossed the thought into her traffic-jammed cranium.  She had noticed her new obsession with  skimming pricetags, learning&nbsp;the crafty art &nbsp;in figuring out how one could get drunk with little to no income.  She calls it "crafty". Others call it "thrifty or frugal".  Point blank, she is piss poor white trash. Technically, she should be living in the streets. Three dollars and some change gets nothing. Maybe two loads of laundry. The legitimate&nbsp;intelligence is seeping from this woman  on somedays.....like, the ones where she  dismisses the bars and stays holed up alone in her bedroom. Or pretends&nbsp;to "hate" a best friend to keep everyone steady.  Belching one of those deep, close-mouthed internal bombs that leaked  an odd backwash...she shoves the un-used ashtray away to concentrate on the dilemmas that needed immediate solutions.  Trying to have a drink with her Anxiety  and Panic, to come home stumbling drunk to  her lover Insomnia."  &nbsp; a snippet (hahahaaaaaaajuteinsider) of a concept being developed. huzzah for progression.... i'll snippet more tomorrow....  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

Insomnia  and i eloped on  Sunday.   she's    my    bitch now.  and a  big huge props  to   Andy....   he may be one of the few lifesavers i have  encountered recently....and  sincerity is a  rarity  for this modern day humanity .

      these&nbsp;pathetic mechanisms.... and their stagnent follow-throughs.... as stated in an email with the barrel fully loaded.... the desperate need for a pestilence to engulf it all.... shooting off from&nbsp;my fingers as if they were my mouth..... typing in the normal fury.... and stating that i love life.  but,  i told a few that&nbsp;  i hated living   amongst these    shit-throwing   monkeys that call themselves    "driven sophisticates."   each of us all&nbsp;a day closer to  being&nbsp;nothing more than carrion for the worms.  equality&nbsp;will be&nbsp;reached when none of us will have  the adaptibility to appreciate&nbsp;or the competence to fully grasp it...for we will all be rotting somewhere.    dead.    gone.  forgotten faster than we wish to believe. scramble for the signifigance NOW. IMMEDIATE gratifications blind and take over....  wasting life after life in pursuit of nothing.  diaphanous titles landed by  prevarications and the ones that  have nothing left to do but tag along.  i will continue to bathe in naphthalene to deter these&nbsp;blood-suckers..... keep these assassins with smiles away.

      that's the way&nbsp; this  life&nbsp;goes.  events continuing the eradication  of jubilations built as high as i can construct them...  only for the  tides to  barrel  and  rip  right on through .   no mercy shown.  left  soaked  and  breathless   on another foreign shore  that should be familiar by now.   taking me for walks on my own leash  in the middle of the nights  with   air thick enough to drink  ,  head full of nonsense and  ninety percent  of the  same  thoughts  running around the same loops is only  pushing this   aging youth'   s  impetus  insanity   even further to rancorous authenticity.   i  cannot  sleep with  the   M  oment   anymore....she has been cheating on me   always  .   this life has been exposed&nbsp;to  many a city&nbsp;well-stocked with   Big Talkers .....boasting skills and talents  with   no walk   to support their  fractious  works.  their  cheap canvasses  painted with   the brushes      of plundering derivatives  ,  bristles dipped in pigments  made of  tempestuous lies ....presentations  decorated with   more  &nbsp; "important" &nbsp;human&nbsp;figures&nbsp;to   sell sell sell  that image,  with&nbsp; names dropped  in   massive   heaps  like   turds dripping from their facial assholes   to be  certain that these bogus efforts are   beyond  credible...  therefore making them  more&nbsp;lavish  than  their needy audience, who  are the   starving artists&nbsp;with the      occupation of being &nbsp;"hip by association."     slip in the  right mickey  and feed it to these hungry....  now stand up on that podium and   direct the drugged little  gluttenous  herds  that  give  marvelous  handjobs.....the  best  jack-off material  that   this   side of the  Mississippi  has    EVER    seen....  to constantly  stroke  these morons and   keep their whores    and unimaginative devotees&nbsp;in their place.      any   humdrum mountain of steaming  bullshit  can   taste like a delicacy when      frosted.     capitalism and greed&nbsp;in it's&nbsp;purist form.    wiping their mouths to  display their shit-eating grins, keeping the   daggers well hidden  behind their   own   backs.....  dispose and ignore the kind that     aren't    taken by their  false humanitarianism .   which is why i&nbsp;prefer to keep to myself.   i might as  well  be   bona fide outta-my-mind  .  one person attempting to  confute  with the   populace   has   left this drowning fish/flying mammal antagonistic.   what a thing to   announce    and form an acclimatized relationship, for i  have    no choice  when it comes to    sitting beside myself  .   well, now that  THAT  is all out of my system....  i went about with joe last evening  which helped  boost a bit of confidence .  it's refreshing to be a part of the few remaining  things that could be   constituted   as  beautiful.   an  adorable  little old woman was selling roses  and had help by the front doorman  in coming up and into the   Liar's Club  .....  which was thankfully peaceful and   freezing   inside.  she exclaimed that my "gorgeous purse went  well" with me....  (i guess she believed me to be a picturesque being.)   the  same chump  that gave  my   cleavage   a   thorough   study  began mackin' on  two women to the right of me .  he   declined   the chance  to be diferential and  whisk  those ladies  right off of their chairs  by&nbsp; turning down  the woman with the   three dollar roses  .   i'm    sure    he didn't blink all night to  buy them more    drinks to "better his chances".   what a friggin'  MAN .   i do hope&nbsp;that rose&nbsp;made   julie all warm n' fuzzy  ......joe was  the   only   gallant man in the room  and had bought one.   she went off slowly with  a smile that made my heart sore,  and made her way  humbly out the door.   rain is coming and the rain is falling.  the breeze is delicious right now.   &nbsp;  " PROSAIC :&nbsp;  plain and ordinary, unoriginal, lacking imagination, the American public in general ."

      for  ONCE. .....i can say that i am  slightly   content. i am not sure how often  these moments come to me.  i can only be honest with saying they are  still  quite  rare.  &nbsp;  i wrote  sections  of a small poem to a friend of mine  that i don't hear from very often.  his lifestyle keeps him  rather occupied...be it professional or personal vendettas  that keep his schedule  hectic and cramped.  even though he crops up as much as these points of  peacefulness and semi-happiness....  i  consider him a decent find .  &nbsp;  i had gone to see " Born Into This"  at the  Music Box.   it permitted various emotions to expell and  caused the thoughts to invade spaces again....  rampant and staggering  some were.  i always believe that i will be conditioned to maintain  some form of stability over  sensations like this someday.  but whenever it happens...it's like a challenge i hadn't faced yet,  even though&nbsp;these are&nbsp;fimiliar battles...and the  enemy is typically myself anyways,  there never seems to be a proper stratagem  to execute the perfect solution.  &nbsp;   misery comes from attachements .... always.   &nbsp;  it inspired me to write these few small  portions of nonsense. i gave my friend only pieces  in order to avoid driving the poor boy insane with  my rants:  &nbsp;  " i was jesus for today.......  &nbsp; walking upon waters.  &nbsp; some would say  &nbsp; that this  &nbsp; was a blasphemous declaration.  &nbsp;&nbsp;but my introspection  &nbsp;&nbsp;says i am merely describing one  &nbsp; hell of a hangover.  &nbsp; one must believe  &nbsp; before it could be  &nbsp; considered  &nbsp; blasphomy.  &nbsp; on my knees.....  &nbsp; such litotes  &nbsp; for a person&nbsp;like me to say.  &nbsp;&nbsp;the bottlecap says  &nbsp; "please try again."  &nbsp; sometimes it says  &nbsp;&nbsp;"you are a winner."  &nbsp; alas, not today.  &nbsp; not today.  &nbsp; a dark&nbsp;day for now.  &nbsp; this is a  &nbsp; faux pas&nbsp;christ's  &nbsp; nativity."  &nbsp;  minor in obscurity. i guess it only matters  that&nbsp;i understand what i was talking about.  &nbsp;  we had a  wonderful  rehersal last night.   very  encouraging, considering it  all got off on rather troubled footing.  i missed my friends when i was off  having alone time, family time and old friend time  out in the farmland.  i was happy to be back in chicago....  for  once .  &nbsp;  our drummer, joe st. charles....whom i will call  "joey"   to keep confusions down for  any readers that skim my prose...  was telling   dead baby jokes   after  rehersal.  how sick that i admit&nbsp;a few&nbsp;cracked me up.....  at least i couldn't answer  the  serial killer question  correctly.....  or how  most  convicted  serial killers  have&nbsp;answered&nbsp;it.  &nbsp;  and to think,  my penmanship  has been  noted as  looking    like a  serial killer  scribed my words and    birthed my literature.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  and that goes   right   back to  my friend mentioned before.  &nbsp;   maybe  i will hear  good words  from him  soon .  what goes around comes around.  or so i have been told.  &nbsp;  "  CRUCIFORM :&nbsp;  cross-shaped .

        soooo , i am in the process of nursing    a hangover....the first major one in  quite  sometime.    sheesh.....    all swimmy and surreal.....waking up    to a room that still wants to move in different    directions....the eight pound    object that&nbsp;stores the nervous system's powerhouse    is shut down breifly from regular easy    goin' motions and basic motor skills have been    placed upon the backburner somewhere else.     &nbsp;   you feel the sloshing of last night's    consumptions splash around as the liver and kidneys    strain to work even harder    to detoxify the chemicals swallowed without&nbsp;protest    or second thought.&nbsp;    you know that your poor brain isn't hooked up    to the wires that make up the spinal cord....    certainly not executing like it still might.     &nbsp;   a day like jesus.    where you might as well be walking on water.   i wrote a poem about that.   &nbsp;   i wonder if that fellow "dork" i watched writing    breifly is swimming today, too.    or another adorable girl named julie.....    poor thing was already swaying in the invisible    tides when she walked out the bar door at 4 A.M.    or the guy with the hilarious dog stories    which will be posted when i am a bit more functional.     &nbsp;   am i the only person that has ever felt like    they are being  point-blank lied to ....by a supposed "best" friend?    possibly to  "spare&nbsp;my feelings?"     or  "it just simply isn't any of my buisness??"     guys?    is it  normal  for you to  lie  to women?    ladies?    is it  normal  for you to  lie  to men?     &nbsp;   i need to understand that i may be the only one left    that taps into and goes through emotions.....    not fear and avoid them.    there is no such thing as "too intense."    that's where real&nbsp;discovery and experience&nbsp;can happen.    perhaps that it why i feel like i am potentially outgrowing    a few people that had me    under lock and key for a silly amount of time.     &nbsp;   for some reason, i can't seem to understand    that people can be out until seven in the morning    attempting a mock bullshitter project....    (like a two hour album&nbsp;complilation of nonsense)    and this happens several times a week....    for a few months....    with  no results to be proud of yet whatsoever .     &nbsp;   or four in the morning when the bar was    closed at two.    and the tattoo still didn't get finished in    an allotted six hours.     &nbsp;   sounds like an aspiration to be a super sleuth.....    or completely paranoid overthinking habits.    or simply not wanting to be    dicked around anymore.     any  feedback  anyone ?   &nbsp;  and i was beginning to remember all these other  crushes i have held before....and movies i  couln't list due to limitations on  the profile size.  i have to  thank joe  for the few reminders.  like,  Jared Leto ....i forgot him momentarily. the list had been posted.  &nbsp; and i had spelled "Labrynth" wrong.

      the  promising job interview  turned into  a  landed position . about friggin' time i managed to  snag a decent source of income. and i have yet  another photo shoot  for  this job tomorrow.... in a week, i will have graced...(? right word for this maybe??)  two websites  promoting me, myself and i and am on my way to being a  "recognized"   resident of this city. i dunno if i should be  thrilled  or even  more  paranoid.   haha.    strange enough , while walking to the  interview....believing it to be a  "nice" evening...taking  Ashland  all the  way down to the corner of  Fullerton  and  Clybourn ... some guy shouted at me from his car on the other side of  Ashland in pursuit of the opposite direction i was headed...right before i hit  Barry.   he shouted,  " HEY!    one of your favorite rapper's is    MURS !!!"  i looked around as other motorists looked at the maniac screaming "facts" about me.... wondering  who  in the  hell  he was. i yelled back, no flare or evidence that i knew what he was talking about, uncertain that i had really heard this guy right...   "WHAT??? ..... MURS ???" feeling a bit  uneasy over the capricious moment taking place.  " YEAH ..... MURS ! i  SAW  you  THERE ! you were  TALKING TO HIM !  AT THAT SHOW !!!"  i had one drawn-on eyebrow cocked at this man yelling  at me injudiciously.... my nature of analysis came into play instantaneously:  " what  in the  hell ?  was he  hoping  i  scream  my  digits back at him so  every monkey  and estranged  unknowns in their car could  write it down ? did that kinda shit  really  happen?   has it worked for this maniac before ? was he waiting for me to cross four lanes of traffic, (in slow motion....arms outstretched... elaborate soundtrack of a romantic interlude of passionate awakening at  FINALLY  finding  my  long-lost lover )  hop in his car, both of us  speeding off into the dusk of the blazing Tuesday evening?  amazed that my  Prince Charming  had  finally  come?? was this one of those examples of somebody  attempting to be  more  captivating by   freak association ?"   i simply waved him off while nodding my head.... he then appeared defeated... waved back. the light had turned green. off the familiar stranger went.  i continued walking....  please , dearest unknown deity...  please  don't have that wacko put up a  Reader Ad  to continue his  elusive search for the girl he saw at  an  April  show.  the unimaginative cheesy headline will read:  "Looking for my Tattooed Rapper Girl."   maybe this is another reason i am being placed upon the  "Wall of Tolerance".  i seem to not have a problem with rolling odd shit off of my back anymore. it makes for a brief amusing storyline, though.  i received the invitation to be honored on the Wall of Tolerance by  Rosa Parks  and  Morris Dees  for my   personal efforts in making America a place of tolerance ... since i am one of those types that can't stand the ignorance of people black-listing their  fellow citizens, executes hate and  unfair behaviors towards their neighbors due to personal preference, religion, race, creed, age.... like, what this entire nation was  BUILT  upon.... love your friggin' neighbors already,  you  dorks .  the Wall has been designed by architect  Maya Lin ,  the  same individual  that  developed  the   Vietnam Veteran's Memorial  in Washington, D.C. and is being erected in time for the  50th Anniversary  of when  Mrs. Parks refused to give up her seat.  i will be a  Founding Member . check the website at:   urlLink www.Tolerance.org   i watched a  very  demented version of  "Alice in Wonderland"  done by a Czech animator named  Jan Svankmajer  in 1987. the animation reminded me of the old school  Gumby  episodes that were twisted in their own right. this movie...simply entitled  "Alice"   made my head cramp. it was surreal....very nightmarish. the White Rabbit freaked the shit outta me when he first came "alive" and ripped himself off of his platform. being a victim of taxidermy... whenever he got a "cut" or injured... sawdust would pour out in representation of his blood.  there was a scene where he was eating a bowl of sawdust.  his eyes all bugged out.... his buck teeth more like fangs.... he clicked them rapidly....and often.  and it only perpetuated in  its creepiness. i dunno how easy it would be to find a copy of this....  i recommend it to anyone who can stomach such absurdity with dillusional, dark undertones . and these reasons are why i  loved  it  so much. this guy probably hung out with  Timothy Leary  back in the day.... or simply created these animations to pacify and control his obvious madness. his  wife  made  many  of the dolls. a creative and insane couple.  i can relate.  i have decided if i am  ever  gonna  get married, it will be to  Angelina Jolie . sounds predictable and  totally  obvious when  i  say this, but it's true. she just got a brand new enormous tiger tattoo upon her lower back done in  traditional ancient method of tapping upon  skin with tools that resemble nothing more than a sharp stick. that  IS  what the name  "tattoo"  means....  "to tap."   if she wants to adopt a million kids from  a million countries.... and she is apparently  out of her mind .... that's  fine by me . if she wished to keep a vile of  my blood around her neck  and have insane rampant sex multiple times a day....several days out of the week... i will be  more  than happy to  tolerate her madness.  hell, invite her  brother  to join.  it's been over a year for her. it's been a year for me. i would stroke her long hair while she rested her head in my lap. she would take me to get a traditional tattoo upon my leg in Thailand. we would  travel the world  and  freak  everyone out by  saying things that  "normal"  people simply don't say. we would marry  just  to piss off the government and those who feel we would be  defecating upon the "definition of unity between two people who love each other  unconditionally" , and have a stupid slip of paper declaring us  "legal".   it would be a  beautiful  thing.  if we don't work out....i will always settle for  Helena Bonham Carter , who hasn't married   Tim Burton ... or  Audrey Tautou ..... or  Juliette Binoche ....(my crush since witnessing the  "Three Colors"  series) i've given up on  Christina Ricci . she needs to eat a couple grilled cheese sandwiches......  four times daily .... for at  least  a year....with a six pack of   PBR  to wash it all down.  if there is  no one left  in that lineup.... and I am on the  brink  of  pushing 50 ... i guess i'll have to take up   Nicholas Cage's  offer that i keep  turning down respectfully. by then,  nobody  will want our aging asses.... hell, he may not even be functional by then.

      and  now ...a small story:  she's back in the house implanted in the depths of a city a mere   five hours  from the places where the phantoms dwelled. this time, she opened the door... her smile widespread across her tired  (yet youthful) face.  she gripped her demon's hands... this time,  she  lead them in.  she  lead the dance moves.  she  had the last word.  she was appraised this week as something she has yet to accomplish. in the mind-set of a few, she's  already  peaked. in the mind-set of a few others, she has failed  miserably . it matters  not  what these few believe, think and say. they  do not  construct her walls.  many times, they've helped to tear a few down. maybe even take a  stab at alteration.....redecoration..... rehabilitation.  on the  good  days, she can walk straight. on the  not-so-goods , she can  pretend  she's okay.... shaking hands firmly can be  like riding a bicycle. one  never  forgets how to please those  that hold no viable importance to what could be the rest of her life. on the  really dark  days, she can only mumble... gaze off in distances and zones only  a few can tap into.... as if she had become ridden with  aphorism.  the week  plunged  her into moodswings  that she chose to  finally  handle and attempted to  avoid  reacting immediately ... absorb  everything like a sponge in attempt to squeeze herself of it all later. wring it out in the confines of her morbidly hot bedroom back in Chicago.   one occasion  during the week  did  cause  a swelling burst  of irascible despair. disturbing and confusing....but when has anything  ever  been clear? that sliver in her interior.... poking at her  constantly  to keep the  reality in check   made the infection progress and  worsen  briefly. she wished that  numbness   could be an option, but  scabs can't heal when always picked upon.  figuring someday, her emotions would get their chance at being   nothing more than scar tissue.   for now, she's trying to  push  the diseases out.... the frothing pus of virulent memories seeping out slower than  most  would be able to handle.  she debated on  gnawing  the infected pieces  off .... but an  amputee still feels  the limbs no longer present .  not  an option. she knew she had to nurse the infestations back to health. she wouldn't doubt that she may  potentially die trying.  the  entire  week was  not hideous ..... she witnessed  two days of rainbows .... she hoped it  might  reflect  good fortune   was coming soon. hunks of juicy cantaloupe, watermelon, a specific herb  and coffee was provided by her parents, who finally embraced certain decisions she had made  quite a while ago. she  picked green beans  from the garden and  mowed the lawn . she looked at the stars like she had planned. she introduced  "The Big Lebowski"  to her mother... her father had already seen it. they watched  "Mad TV"  for a whole saturday afternoon talking and laughing... trying to feel better. it was  the most  television she had had in  years .  she watched  classic episodes  of  Flip Wilson  cast  an embarrassing penumbra over what  she believed to be the rare few "innovations" of today's  broadcasts..... Dave Chapelle  can hardly  compare to guests like  Ray Charles ,  Richard Pryor ,  The Pointer Sisters  and a black man named Flip   dressing in drag back in the  early 1970's.  it became another reminder at how quick americans forget their history, even with television.  she drank  jagermeister  for the first time in a while one evening, and hated the two  days that passed afterward. some guy at the bar called  "Muddy Waters"  told her his sister housed   "The White Stripes"  before they  hit it big. her ex, the bartender pulled  strange moves and apologized later. some aging cover band called   "Cheese Pizza"  tried getting her to  hang with them in their room. she copped a worker's shirt from "Muddy's". she watched fireworks with her dad and brother outside their minute town...and another night while  hanging with faces from  years long past.  she saw  "F/9-11"  with a friend who hadn't in the  ONE  theatre that played it. the  owner  of the place  thanked everyone  in the crowd for coming and showing support.   he shook everyone's hand again at the end of the show, and after the standing ovation.   she drank whiskey sours out of a mason jar.  she ran into many who placed her in a strange mindframe.... suddenly she was  16  all over again.  she was blatantly hit on and groped by  a man that has been with her  grandmother for 21 years. chaos insued within her family again. she felt ill for a couple more days.  she listened to an old friend's punk band called  "Sadistic Kids."  they were going to tour with  "Rise Against."  he was with a girl now. he was much happier. his younger brother was crashing on an air mattress in his one bedroom apartment due to the lack of work up in the town his brother was going to school at. both were happy to see her. she drank vodka and cranberry juice on ice. she falls in love with   "Against Us"  and  "Streetlight Manifesto."  he offers to play a show  in her basement someday.  she says she would like that.  she met her younger brother's fiance. the emphasis of her own loneliness  became enormous....she took the introduction  in a totally ignorant context.... and it caused her to retaliate and  approach the brief hello with a hint of remorse.  she  immediately  regretted it.  she sobbed over some of her behaviors while on her way home... tears blurring the road at midnight as she passed over the  Mississippi . she pondered a moment over pulling over and  hurling  her body over that bridge. would the water be cold? would she suffer from the impact, or would the waters be a  hard welcoming slap  before  the peaceful silence  tucked her in... to be washed ashore  in a bloated heap a few days later?   no.   she was home by three A.M.  and  her band  would be  touring the Midwest  soon....  St. Paul  and  Detroit  already on the roster.... and a  promising  job interview is happening tomorrow. and her dad called to be sure she  got home okay. and she had been invited to go paddleboating with  a woman who's  kids looked up to her ....  and she had yet to meet them.   there would be  no  jumping off of bridges this year.

       where  to even  begin ....  i attempted to write about my adventure had in my  car out to iowa...got to the point of the "Fourth" events sprawling nicely as if i was being  witnessed and  documented by a vivaciously observant storyteller... when this  dinosaur  of a machine  still  classified as a  "computer"  had a lock and freeze over some  illegal operation that had been instilled.  after my  rabid howl  over losing witty one-liners, words that breathed lightly and hummed softly....  sounding like it could hold sagasity without being too ardent,  paragraphs built with  just  the right amount of strategic metaphors with a couple slices of  quirky vocabulary....  i calmed.....   and decided it could've been executed much  better yet, anyway.    still  in the state of corn and  NASCAR . drank  whiskey sours  out of a  mason jar  in a bar  on  First Ave .... saw  "F 9/11"  again with an old friend at the cheap seats.  the owner of the theater thanked everyone for  showing, for supporting.... one of two in this  ENTIRE STATE   is showing this flick.  after the standing ovation during credits, filtering out, he  thanked us all individually , shaking hands...encouraging us to tell our friends. an amazing experience back in my hometown area.  god damned , it has  been  a while.  today was run-ins with people of the past.... i was suddenly  fifteen  all over again running into the father of an ex from high school. he was impressed with me still. we joked over his habit of "warning you n' matt"  with his footsteps down those stairs  while matt and i "got to know each other better."  hahahaaaaaa.....(and  now ??!  god , it's been a  year??!! )  and his son, my ex from close to ten years ago, is rather successful and getting hitched next year.  some of the best news heard all week.  i knew  Matthew Fee  was going to go far. beyond happy for him.   uuuggghhh ....i will return in a few days. ironic that my guitarist  Robb Shakespeare  just dropped me a note... he is back in iowa for a visit. he was originally from the same spot as me... now we may hang  in spots where we just missed crossing paths ten years before.  i have been up for a  consecutive 43 hours ... words and thoughts are fuzzy.   bed sounds good right now.  my parent's cat corkey...pushing eleven years old, has a wheezy little snore when she sleeps.  i hear it now: (".....*wheee!*...snuuuuu....*whee!*)  laughing out loud briefly.  sentances..... shortening!   must-sleep- now !  yes.  nighty-night.

      prepping for a weekend  trek to the  homestate . i always feel a bit eccentric...more so than usual,  before taking the four and a half hour drive to territory that introduced my existence. it continues to  grow slightly more foreign every time i visit.  there are so many small plots of land, alleyways,  apartments, houses, streets, backyards, trails, cornfields, graveyards, clubs, schools, and ped malls that  still have an uncomfortable grip upon some of my former selves that peek  their heads in and try to carve a spot for an old opinion or thought to pinch my new developments off for a few days. hardly ghosts, barely shadows anymore, yet, i can still sense the invisible presence of  the figurative youthful corpses  composed mainly of black memories awaiting eagerly for my arrival. their strength never fails to surprise me still.  in each  place that remain mortuaries for my dead past, i wander through it all in my present context, hardly noticed by those who have never left it. i have become unrecognizable in the one place  that contains most of my adolescent roots and childhood traumas. makes being a nomadic yet determined woman pushing 25 even more difficult to accept when  people you spent at least 15 years with can walk past....not having enough prevalent evidence to even  do a double-take.  the only thing i love to do in my own  archaiac ritual happens when  the evening fully develops and i can lay out on the cement in my parents backyard and actually SEE the night sky....take in the infinite, deep atmosphere decorated in astrological glitter. it's a spectacle almost forgotten about,  since one can't see it through the glare and man-made overthrow of citylights eliminating such a scene. summertime nights have always been the best,  for the slab of concrete is still warm from the sun having beaten down upon it all day.   erica  sent me a  hilarious  analogy  of  earth being an anal bead  for the huge gaping black asshole of whatever supposed god may be out there.  you know....there  is  a  suspected black hole   in the  center  of our  Milky Way . hmmm....  permitting this to be the case.... i bet "god" can't wait for  good ol' Saturn and Jupiter.... saturn's rings  alone   carry hunks of rock the  size of mountains .  i found this wild... for  prior  to reading  her email today, i had  read about the discovery of the most ancient, and supermassive black hole ever encountered. it has been entitled  "Q0906+6930."  you would think they could call the thing  "Brobdingnagian Bob"  or  "Excessive Edith"  ..... or  "A Goddamned Gargantuan Pile of Black".  it's  12.7 billion light years away ....in the constellation of  Ursa Major.   all this talk coming from  me, an individual celebrating a year of celibacy.... makes it even more  humorous in a way.

      "sometimes i wish i was a man. and it's those times when  i noticed that i tend to stop thinking. there are my  points  i wish that i was a man. those are times that i start drinking... provoking  sensations that  will never be constituted  as being a pure chauvinist. always gonna be that striving verbal  termagant.... too small for her  britches  and words. sometimes i really wish  i was a man. those ideas of sleeping with Her "just this once" becomes enough for my self-assurance's Promotion Via the Male Emptiness.

      "Poppies will help them sleep....."  Rumsfeld is taking Action. Yep.  and this only means our Government wants  to spend more Money and  RULE THE WORLD IN THE NAME OF  GOD AND DEMOCRACY!!!   The Cultivation of Opium Poppies is a huge business in the lovely country of Afghanistan. HOW huge???? Three-Quarters of the WORLD'S Opium Poppy Trade  comes out of Afghanistan.  Most heads up to Europe, which aids in  supplying the junkies  with their beloved Heroin.  $2.3 BILLION accounts for more than  HALF of the nation's gross domestic revenue..... here in the States, we also keep that  trade flowing from this monstrously profitable crop.  Naturally, the genius that is Rumsfeld made this whammy of an observation that the United States needs to  Intervene with ANOTHER affair. when Afghanistan will have the World Record Poppy Crop this Year.  AND, this is AFTER the fact that the  Taliban's Religious policies.... (a method continually used by various  governments...BUT NEVER WORKS as a preventive method fully....) eliminated quite a bit of the crops, but farmers still find ways around the system, and the cultivation and harvesting has flourished since 2001.... and after the Fall of the Taliban.  Good-Ol' Donald also  makes another wonderful exclamation that  these "Criminals are Opposed to  a Strong, Democratic Government"  (yes kids....the wisdom is OVERFLOWIN' NOW....) and that the Drug Profits  can be tied to the Taliban and Al-Qaida... kinda like the weapons of mass destruction phenom.... so....we best get our asses in there and do something about that, too.  On top of dropping $3.3 BILLION for a  FIVE YEAR MILITARY PACKAGE towards the "efforts" down in Colombia to eradicate the cocaine trade.... which has made no dent whatsoever in getting it off the streets or downplay the street value here in the U.S.... for there still is "no shortage of the supply"... how the hell does it  make sense to continue the  financial plunge attempting to "Stop" something else?? sending more troops off for  another "just" purpose??  So....diminish the starving farmers that are merely  surviving off of addicts and rich assholes that stock the supply for the U.S. in the first place...since coffee doesn't pull in shit for  income compared to the cola plant... that became a drug and is purchased by those with the money to do so??  like, the "War on Terror"...with more threats than ever??  why does this sound like an overpriced equation that nine year olds in business suits  can't compute, explain or figure out?  hopefully....the meteor shower can be  visual tonight....reminding me that we are nothing but  floating particles announcing our "purpose" in the most meaningless ways possible.  it's all so conspicuously benighted....  " FONTANELLE :  a soft spot on an infant's skull               where the bones have not yet fused together....needn't say more..."

      that is what i am calling everyone... for Cunts, Bitches, Pricks, Motherfuckers, Whores, Sluts, Assholes, Dickheads, Skanks,  Hookers, Trash, Bastards, Shitheads, Eels, Slimeballs, Dipsticks, Dipshits, Numbnuts, Ignorant Fucks,  Back-Stabbers, Idiots, Jerkoffs, Buttplugs, Retards, Morons,  Manipulative Selfish  Pieces of Nothings..... It all has been over used to emit frustrations and attempt to "Make" someone or something look or feel horrible.  The brilliance of pushing the good stuff away and allowing the rotten  to sit and decay even longer.... will do nothing but place one  on the exact same spot.  intelligence is measured by  recorded knowledge obtained by  someone else who lived before  everyone else..... we just regurgitate..... quote the brain and mindset of another and make it be our own. walk someone else's gait. talk someone else's origins... live and pretend to be  content in a lie.... for that's  what we are Supposed to do.  so.....does one risk losing the most valuable thing for the shit that  keeps the misery present? how frightening it has been to  always wake up every FUCKING day to what is viewed as nothing..... but to speak the Truth would keep it all in the same place....  risking what has never happened for the sake of those who will never be involved nor understand.  witnessed as a sacrifice no longer..... when the rest of one's life is fully at stake....

       Deja Vu....  and not really.  the ever familiar routine of placing belongings into rectangular cardboard containers that have seen one too many variations of habitats.  recall this week when the  Squealing Little Copper  had his cherries twirling.... ....flashing the implication to move a compact, soon-to-be reposessed  vehicle to the right and into a speeding semi. figures we'd all get  off on the same exit. figures the agitation wouldn't  be worth it.  how much  more energy  needed to be drained  into uselessness?  resting the head on a fantastically suitable pillow...... without even having to  make  contact.  recall that:  "Pigs may not be Snakes.....  and  Beelzebub was  a Fallen   Angel."   what to make of  The Facts .... when something will always  be prepping  to challenge  and dismember  The Theories ?

      The eccentric and  highly influential painter   Salvador Dali  took his pet  ocelot to a  Manhattan  restaurant.  The exotic creature caused a woman in the same facility to be  completely frightened  and began exclaiming her protest in panic and rather loudly over the wild beast being permitted to  sit and dine in such an accommodating atmosphere. (the   feline  ... not   Dali ...)  Dali, applying his charm to reassure the  understandably flagrant with agitation woman that his ocelot was actually an unusually large  domestic feline that he had  "painted over with an Op Art design."  he explained with such speech, eloquence and confidant disposition.... that he managed to  present a masterfully unsolicited  and inviolable cajolery.   the woman retorted with immense relief: "oooooh, my Goodness!....i can see  NOW  what it is!" she breathed in and extracted a  sigh  that sounded   somewhat desperate  as she gripped the explanation that became   Truth  for her  presented in the moment of  emasculated fear.   she then said to a grinning Dali:  "at first....i thought it was a real ocelot."    " INTRINSIC:   existing in a thing as a natural or permanent quality; essential; used to identify one's existence."

      as the patience lives up to the virtuous myth.... as trust becomes rediscovered... the hours have all blended as reality kicked on the fast-forward button.  and the ends of eras are being adapted into the  scraps and fragments of new beginnings.  reconstruction is still an uneasy task...for one still has to hammer, saw, cut, paste, measure, realign, get more supplies, better insurance, knock down to expand and improve, rewire....  i had told a friend just now that even the day  breathed effortlessly.... the weighty coat of dense humidity had been shed and thrown away. the wind blew hard and confidant. the moon in the halfway phase of  turning back to black.   "feeling the resonance  from the remnants of every event past. finally consuming  the harpooning affect that had been applied upon this discontented body. the wasted wont and gravitational pull, all of it  was unneeded. the familiar is the easiest to salvage. nonetheless, one can't help but feel  slightly defeated. the seeds planted. the seedlings destroyed. plants grew, but their fruits they bore had become rotten. there wasn't much for a harvest. still,  all reaped what they had sown. using the decaying material to fertilize the  overturned soils. the corpses of weeds sprawled out, roots spread like the legs of worthless strumpets.... lifeless upon the battlegrounds. for the new days are  in incubation.... thriving amongst what most would consider  devastation."

      i know that i am proceeding to  blow back the Lake affect by molding and restructuring the hypertension and  direction...  my little packet of tea says  "Sweet Dreams."  it's my late-night  fortune cookie replacement.  my Homestate just conducted a study  in the spring over  drinking whipworm eggs to sooth and alleviate  inflammatory bowel disease.   nuts , man.  totally  nuts!!   "welcome to the crow's nest."   and the  FDA  has approved maggots and leeches before humans. hahahahaaaaa.... MAGGOTS ....and  LEECHES.  most people i know can be classified  as blood-suckers.... not for the betterment....  like i need mind erasers. or maybe i do.  and i;m so glad we have developed a new drug to  pop in order to achieve a safer and more rapid tan when there are people  DYING  of shit left and right.  i've lived amongst those who live and feed  off of their  excoriations  of others. i'd like to breathe soon.  " MANQUE :  having failed to become something one might have; almost everyone."
