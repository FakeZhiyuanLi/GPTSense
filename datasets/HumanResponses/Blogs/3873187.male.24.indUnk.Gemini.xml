      Well this morning I have taken the first step to become the person that I should have been a long time ago.  There is a diet/workout plan that a friend of mine turned me on to that I have to say is very exciting.  It is not surrounded by all the hype that you seem to find when you talk about getting into shape.  Basically it is the old fasioned eat right and work out plan.  You eat 6 small meals a day and work out 6 days a week.  I got up this morning at about 6:30 and did a cardeo workout and I had it proven to me on how out of shape I really was.  But now the challenge is staying on track and not getting burned out.  It will be a challenge but the results will be worth every minute spent on this.  The book that I am reading about this asks you to write down what it is that drives you to make this change.  I have to say other than the obvious of getting into shape I want to do it to make others think "Oh, what did I let go!?!"  For those of you that know me you can only imagine who I am refering to in this situation.  For starters my most recent ex-girlfriend but I wouldnt mind getting that reaction out of one of my older ex's too.  Mandy and Katie, beware....there is a new kid on the block and you are going to be kicking yourself for the rest of your life that you gave this up.  Your loss and my gain...not only will I be in the best shape of my life but I am also with someone now that makes me smile!  Sure I smiled before with the others but not this much or this naturally.  This is one small step for Dan and one giant leap for Dan's Mind!

      I was in the middle of the worst possible day of my life.  My ex-girlfriend managed to get back into the spotlight of my existence and took it upon herself to make my life a living hell.  Nothing was said, not even single word; just the presence of her along with the unforgiving imagination made me fight against the rip currents that keep pulling at my heart.  There she was, right in front of me, telling me about her new boyfriend, the one that she shouldn't have, the one that makes this whole equation come out to nothing more than a far fetched guess of why my existence plagues this earth, the one that should be me standing there, I am the one that she should be speaking about, she knows it but it is almost like it is a game for her, to see how long the salt can be pushed into the wound before I just scream.  She wanted time, she wanted space, so what the f**k is she doing with another man that is just going to sh!t on her.  I gave her the world and part of the moon and I was putting a bid in for a good chunk of Mars.  I would have done anything for her....just to see her smile.  Now looking back I remember few times that she truly smiled....depressing really.  So back to my day, she is telling me all this sh!t about this new excuse for a man.  I am over her, I keep telling myself that, I can be honest in saying that I don’t miss the drama that surrounded everything, but I do miss her.  Standing here hearing her say all of this was like being sentenced to death by paper cuts.  The pain was so much that I just wanted to blow up, there was enough atomic energy within me to completely wipe out several small countries, one more word and that’s it, it will be all over with, I just cant do it, I have had it.....and then it happened............it was like everything stopped to listen to the sounds that followed, a loud click of the trigger setting off the furry that was within and then a crash that didn’t do justice to the power that was going to be unleashed upon its victims.  And then it hit me....literally....as it is 4:30am the cat is thinking that it is time to play while the click of the remote control sliding across my headboard and hitting the other as a jar of pens crashes to the bed inches away from my ear.....the furry within me released as the cat was QUICKLY escorted from my room and the door sent the statement of unwelcome as I stumbled back to bed for another three hours.  I freaken hate my imagination!

      So it has been 3 days short of 2 months since the split from the love that I had.  This was the one that was supposed to be with me for the rest of my life.  I recently moved and it was amazing the things that I found of hers.  From the business card of the jewler that we talked to about engagement rings to her hair spray, everywhere I was and looked there was more to remind me of her.  Sure, I am dating someone else now...trying to move on with my life but every day at one point or another she comes back into my mind.  I am not saying a flash of thought but more of a flood.  Everything that I dreamed of comes back, I want her back, I want everything back.  Then I remember the hell that I had gone through at the end...where nothing was working, there was nothing that I could do right....or nothing I could do at all because she had decided it was not her time to be in this relationship.  I remember making love to her....the first time, the last time...and many times in between.  I remember telling her that I love her for the first time, and I remember her reaction.  I remember talking to her about where we were going to send our kids to school while eating dinner at Houlihan's.  I remember her family and all the fun that was had.  There is nothing to hide....I love her...I still love her....I will always love her.  At this point of my life I have to say that I dont know what is going to happen with me.  I have a girl now that says she loves me....but I can not bring myself to say it back....I dont know that it is there....i am still too stuck on my lost love.  From this point I do not know where to go or what to say or what to do.  I just want to be alone.  I want no one but my friends.  I dont know if I want the relationship but at the same time there are things that I do like about it.  But right now it just doesnt feel right or natural....it feels like I am having to force a smile.  It isnt fair to her or me.  But I am too far in to be able to just walk away without bad reprocussions. (sp)  The shit that I get myself into.....if there isnt any drama involved I will make it....I am convinced of that.  But anywho.....I need to get the hell out of here...it is 5 and time to go home.  Catch ya all later.
