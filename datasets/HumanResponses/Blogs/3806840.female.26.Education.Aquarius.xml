      Well today is another glorious day, back on the sublect of RVC (Rock Valley College)...it is just a terrible school, that in my experiences the classes are not structured properly and the quality is just terrible. Kids who are just starting out should try the larger campuses...why? Because when you live on campus you gain some type of independence and you become apart of the college community and that can be very valueable when it comes to having a good GPA, my first time living on a college campus I got a 3.4 GPA, now that could be due to me being an older student and knowing what is at stake, but all in all, I think that it is better than commuting by far. The quality of classes like at Slippery Rock University in PA is a very good school with quality Professors and a caring community of college students. Rock Valley might be good for adults who are working and trying to take night classes, but in my experiences at RVC were not very good, and I am a guy who never did good in High school, but when I went to RVC I didn't do well there eith with the exception of one semester and this recent class that I just got done taking... I suggest to you young readers is that check out going away to school, cuz the experiences will be educational for you as a person... thus it will make you more well rounded.    Do it now while you are young...cuz you will regret it later.....

      Today, I'm helping my mother set up for a garage sale this weekend and hopefully it can be prosperous financially.  Not much else is going on, got school tonight and I dont like the school.  If anyone out there is anticipating on going to Rock Valley College, dont go, cuz it is a shitty school.

      I just got back last nite at midnight from a trip thru 4 states and 1 country, showing my friend Niagra Falls and where I live when I am not in school in Erie. I am exhausted from driving so much, I heard on the new that we had an earthquake, oh well, I slept thru it. The Hilton hotel was great, the best hotel I have ever been in. Our 1st room was dirty and I complained and the guest rep hooked us up with a jacuzzi suite! The hotel had a 3 story circular water slide inside and there was a new 1.3 billion casino across the street. If you go make sure you take lots of $, because the prices are high as hell.    CYA

      Greetings to ALL,                   Welcome all, this is my first time recording my thoughts and opinions and I like to share them with the world. I write under the name of Annasdad, I will let you figure that one out. I will eventually start to write some of my daily experiences down in this blog and respond to reader inquiries as much as I can. I do ask that you keep it clean and please respect others as well, I appreciate it.    Tonight I open this entry by stating that my wild niece came to visit at 10:30pm with her boyfriend, I will never figure out what she was doing out so late. Anyways, I am currently in summer classes at a local community college that I feel sucks...academically anyways. I currently attend SRU in PA, and I think that is a great university. Not much to do around town, but if you don't mind the drive to some nearby cities, it can be a great place to go to school. I recently completed my first semester there with a 3.4 gpa...thank you...that is the best I have ever done academically in my life.   This blog is open to Opinions, Logic, and Thoughts, as well as political topics and just my everyday thoughts and real world happenings, so I hope you join in my conversations and enjoy this site!    Sincerly, Annasdad

      We had a pretty nice time in IL last weekend.  It flew by so quick.  Anna really enjoyed seeing her daddy and Macka (grandma for those of you who do not speak toddler).  We had our ups and downs (as usual) but through it all, I guess everything went quite smoothly.   It is hard being back and getting into the grind again.  I am just so thankful that it is a short week this week and Friday is tomorrow.  Have a full weekend a head of us... and then only 2 more short weeks and daddy will be home.  I've asked him to help out around the house while he is here taking care of our little girl (and saving me a little money by keeping her outta daycare for a month) He is a bit hesitant about cooking, but I'm sure he'll do fine... his mom is a cook for goodness sake, had to pick something up along those 20 some years!!! ~ttfn!!!!

      I am here at RVC bored out of my mind, waiting for class to start. The only thing about this that I like is socializing with some of my classmates. Anyways, I had a good 4th of July and I got to see my daughter and wife so I am happy and just a few more weeks and i will get to go home.  Chow, annasdad

      Today another beautiful day, a lil muggy, but tolerable. Tomorrow starts the retirement garage sale, many of my mothers things are being sold; things dating back to 1955 and earlier. Some nice bedroom furniture and dressers. I am selling some of my old Windows 2000 series computer books, getting rid of some old things that have piled up in these recent years.  I will get to see my daughter this weekend which will be the greatest. I got to see her last weekend when I went to Niagra Falls....So I think it will be a nice weekend.  Have a good 4th of July!!!

      Well, Annasdad asked me to join him in blogging (if that is the correct term) so here we go! today is a beautiful day... However, here in the basement of my workplace I only get the update from the weatherbug I installed on my computer.  Just getting ready for Anna and i's journey to IL this weekend.  Trying to get as caught up on work as possible in the mean time so I don't come back to a disaster (even though that is probably inevitable) I spoke with my brother last night and think I have decided on running for School Board. My daughter will be entering the school district in a few short years and I want to be sure it is the safest, most formative place she could be... Not only for her, but for all the children of the city.  I have a degree in education, and although I do not currently teach, my heart is always with the children.   Well, break is about over, so I must be on my way!!! TTFN~
