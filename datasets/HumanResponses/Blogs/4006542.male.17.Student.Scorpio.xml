        from other blogs I see you guys who read these, you don't really what to know a bout us but about what we do and the people we know.Any way I got a hair cut last night it was weird.the stupid hair dressers have put there prices up. fucking $18 dollars for a cut instead of $15.My girl friend has brought a car last night.$1000 it was a&nbsp;Mazda its pretty good but not the best looking car.my friend Matthew and his enemy Sam mudgway are still at it,waging war against each other,its more like guerilla warfare.one of then will strike a blow and then the other will.and my mate I live with he sat ends,he needs to decide what he's doing for the rest of his life since hes going to uni but that's really indecisive at the moment with school and work and with the ordeal of getting over his ex even though hes gone out with this hot blonde he brock up with her because he keeps thinking of his ex.he hasn't gone out with his ex for the last 6 to 7 months he needs to get over it really.my other mate I live with brought a $600 amp for his bass guitar and hes buying a guitar this weekend in tauranga.Im going with just for the ride.or I could spend the day with my girl friend but who would want to do that?Just to get this off my chest, I shouldn't have done what I did at the after ball I really shouldn't have.well that's all for now.

         Its monday and im in computing again.its as boaring as always and we have a relever this time.I geuss if you have read my blog you can tell im quite the hipocrate of sorts.What i mean is I was a dick about the reading my blog thing at the end but its true to some extent.If you have time to read this you have time to do other things as well.          &nbsp;    Im going for my lisence in a few days.I know i should have it by now but i just havent gotten round to it.I should be able to do it.       my two mates are worrying about there lives after school and what unis to go to and if thay should split up and go to different places or not.They should just go with it.       For me who knows what ill do may be ill go to wellinton with my other mates and do a computing course or go to auckland with some girl mates of mine.work with my uncle in auckland also or go to hamilton and flat with my mate.even go down to otago and stay down there if i wanted with one of my mates.       But i more then lickly will go to australia to work on a tourisum based job living with my aunti since shes offered.It will be a change for a while.       Who knows aye.

        Well this is my first entry and id like to start by saying I've only started this because my computing class is so fucking boaring.  I go to Waihi college and its a decent school with alot of fucking weirdos and mentaly divergent people who think they know every thing and are loved by every one.  this town called Waihi is a hole its a small town thats soully dependant on a mine thats closing in about 10 years.  this place is a    "HOLE"   evry one leaves as soon as they can and if they dont they end up staying for ever.  I&nbsp;live with my mates in this renivated garage thast got its own bathroom, toilet facilitys and the works.  I've got a 20 year old girl friend who's the shit and oh so beautiful.  I've got heaps of mates,of who im not going to name in this&nbsp; except one who has his own blog here, his names Mattew will's or Murk.  its friday im board i cant wait to get home to get   absolutley Motherd   and play a little  X box  then go out or some thing maybe get some subway or &nbsp;KFC&nbsp;      if you read this i hope you got some injoyment from reading about some one elses life and what they get up to.&nbsp;    If you read this I ask you "Why?" you should be out side or in town, at a mates or fucking out clubing not sitting in some pour conditioned chair at home with most the curtains closed reading about other peoples lives to make your self feel alive. &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    F I N&nbsp;      (Sorry about the spelling)
