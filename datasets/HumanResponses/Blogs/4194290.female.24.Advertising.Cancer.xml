       urlLink    I had to use max zoom on my camera to get a picture of this guy, as well as chase him through the meadow for five minutes until he found a nice spot to hang out.

       urlLink    Mackay Hall. Always dark and foreboding for some reason. Maybe it's just because I went to school here... Or maybe because it's  haunted . Yes, I went to a haunted school. Half the buildings are haunted. The original Chapel burned down on Christmas Eve in the very early 1900s. There was a pyro student on campus who successfully burned down Alumni Hall, needlesstosay the thought crossed my mind occasionally while I was a student there. Plus, we have this really nice clock tower as you can see.  Anyway, I climbed onto the roof of this building when I was a freshman there. Me and two other guys in class. We were told to not do that anymore.

       urlLink    Cicada Killer from Powell Gardens. This is as close as I got to the thing...  Pretty sure Cicada Killer = Hornet or Cicada Killer = Bee of some sort or Cicada Killer = Buzzy, stinging pain.  Don't care for insects.  There were tons of these critters in one part of the garden.  And this cute little sign that said something along the lines of "Don't mind our bugs."  I will mind your bugs if I damn well please, thank you very much.  But at least this one is kinda famous now.
