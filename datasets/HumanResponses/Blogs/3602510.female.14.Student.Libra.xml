      Today I had so much fun.  I met a new guy, his name is Kenny.  I met him at my friends house where we were rehearsing are skit for the MDA fair.  Kenny is the magic mirror in the skit.  He is hilarious. Most of his part is him just making stuff up off the top of his head.  He is 18 and acts like a 15 year old.  Today he tackled me, it was so funny because I play insulted him and he jumped me. We called a truse after that but kept messing around.    most of my friends are guys.  I don't really know why but they are.  I just feel really comfortable around them.  When I am around girls all they do is gossip and talk about you behind your back.  But guys are not like that at all, except for the gay ones but I only have one gay friend.  The guys I hang out with are usually what people call geeks or nerds or whatever you want to call them.  Have you noticed that all the really nice guys are nerds or geeks?

       Looks like an other boring summer.  But this time I am with out my two best friends. Well they used to be my best friends.  I don't think I did anything but we more have just grown apart.  I have just completed my first year of high school.  Now I am really wondering where the time went. I can't even remember what I did most of this year.  But I guess that is just high school.   right now my life is kinda a mess. For starters my parents are ganging up on me and it is getting really old. And my sister is being a real bitch to me.  When he bf gets back from Hawaii she will be back to normal...I hope.  Then there is my love life.  Right now it is taking a break because my bf is working at a summer camp and I can only see him when he comes home on Saturdays. Which really sucks.  He is a junior, my parents hate that I am dating him. They would rather have me date someone my own age.  But if you know me you know that telling me not to do something will make me want it more. Some of my guy friends were upset when I told them about my bf.  They are a bit protective of me. And they are all like brothers to me except for one...
