      So I thought the tennis thing in the title was just a vaguely clever fluorish at first but, as it turns out, it relates to real-life happenings: I am going to the  urlLink  US OPEN !! Two nights, even!! Early round action in nosebleed seats has never sounded so appealing.  I decided today that I want to buy a digital camera. I think. The whole digital thing kind of freaks me out. This could lead to pretentious rambling about the nature of analog "aura" and the materiality of film photography, but it won't for now. Really, the accessories you have to buy just seem so plentiful. Maybe that's just because I only looked at the Circuit City website, and they are sort of in the business of selling accessories people don't really need. Like digital cameras, for example. My shitastic snapshot camera should be fine for my travel needs, and does not require hard disk storage or the purchase of expensive memory cards. The idea of dragging my laptop along on the plane to far far away is not all that appealing either. I guess it's understandable why I feel really old sometimes.   Being able to take pictures whenever I wanted to would be most stellar, though. Imagine all of the Kodak moments I've been missing thusfar. I could take pictures at the US Open even. And a new  urlLink  Friendster picture  or five. I am also coping with IPod lust as well. I find I deal with my digital desire much in the same way as I deal with my ex-boyfriends: by alternating rationalization with ridicule. It's ok to spend $275 on a portable music device because I ride the subway a lot. Really. I do. But people who spend $275 on a little thing the size of a matchbox when they could have a non-skip portable CD played for a fraction of the price are stupid and probably have a trust fund. Fucking IPod rich kids. (See what I mean??)  I should leave my apartment now as it's nearing six o'clock. It's also  urlLink  beautiful outside . Oh the christ, I'm talking about the weather...

      Venture into blogging part two. I think being alone in my apartment with an old repairman and a variety of potentially-toxic, spackling-related fumes may have gone to my head and caused me to voyage back into the world of online journalling. I don't even keep a  regular journal, so this blog will probably be just as tastefully sparse as urlLink  my last one . Also check out the new website for my band,  urlLink always/already . Drummer Emily B. made it. She's certified awesome and also makes wonderful vegan chocolate cake.  Okay, so what else? I just got back from visiting my hometown of St. Louis Park, Minnesota for a few weeks. Good times! Minnesota is really awesome and I miss it a great deal of the time. The air is so clean, the movies are so cheap, and, yes, the people are so nice (albeit at times in vicious passive aggression). It is also home to the best fucking ice hockey team in the world: the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Rah rah rah for Sky-U-Mah! I am an utter hockey dork ( urlLink Miracle  is my new favorite movie. (Disney also owns a big chunk of the Twin Cities radio dial.)).  urlLink Target  was born in Minnesota in the 1960s. The  urlLink rock'n'roll music/bar scene  is clouded by American Spirit cigarette smoke and peppered with ubiquitous regulars. It's wicked.  urlLink Literally wicked : recklessly aloof, rapidly aging bespectacled boys in bands and gaudily over-themed indie-rock mean girls chatter endlessly behind the backs of others. The whole enterprise is framed by a sprinkling of spray-tanned sorority girls and their frat boyfriends who have recently taken up salsa dancing. The drama is high, and the overhead is low ( urlLink drinks are cheap  and there's no sales tax on clothing or shoes). Rarely a dull moment. I miss it already.   In a mere 23 days I will be  flying to Berlin for two months to be  urlLink intensively schooled  in German. I am going to be living on Torstrasse in Berlin-Mitte. I have no idea what that means. At any rate, I aspire to be the best Eurotrash I can be while I'm there. More on this, I'm sure, later.  I guess for now it's back to entertaining myself in my room while I wait for the repairs in my bathroom to be finished.  urlLink The heat is less sweltering today , which is a start. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be sitting on the Promenade of Rockefeller Center in drive-in themed  style tonight. I'll probably just watch some tv and fold socks.
