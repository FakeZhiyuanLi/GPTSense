       urlLink    Hi!  Don't you love it when your sitting at a red light or just cruising and happen to glance over at another vehicle only to see something you don't want to? One thing I find disgusting is people thinking that just because they're in a car and their windows are up people can't see them. So they decide to pick their nose. That alone is a nasty habit. But when the finger is drawn to the mouth and you decide to eat what you pull out...THAT IS JUST FU**ING SICK. HOW OLD ARE YOU? I thought that picking the nose and eating a booger stopped in early childhood. But to do it as an adult? REALLY GROSS!! GROW UP PEOPLE! If you're going to pick your nose actually look to make sure people aren't looking. And if you decide to do this during the day, tint your damn windows!!  Blessings, Moxi

      My husband and I have been married now for almost 3 years. And so far they have been the best 3 years of my life. There have been some times when I just feel like squishing his neck but through all the good and bad times he's always been there for me. About 2 years ago I was hospitalized for an ectopic pregnancy. About a month before that I had a miscarriage so I was already depressed. Now they have to cut me open and take another one away from me? It was a very painful and depressing time. From what my Doctor at the time said I was pregnant with fraternal twins. One I miscarried and the other just decided to attach itself to my tube. I didn't want to have the surgery but it was either the baby or me and the baby. I was in the hospital for about a week. Since the surgery I've had 5 more miscarriages. It gets so depressing. I've pulled myself away from my family and put a little distance between my husband and I. I've been feeling so empty. I want children. I'm just a little sick of people telling me that it's going to be OK. Especially people who have never been through it. There have been times where I've even considered suicide. But my husband has been so supportive. As of right now my period is almost 1 week late. Losing 7 kids in less than 3 years is enough. I can't take another one. So I give it one more week. If I don't start, I'm going to a doctor to get tested. You know the losses wouldn't have been so bad if I had a better Doctor perform my surgery. He was the most insensitive bastard I've ever seen. And if any woman out there sees Doctor Joseph Bell here in Ogden I suggest you see someone else. To me it doesn't matter how far along you are in your pregnancy. You're pregnant with a baby. Even if it's only 3 weeks it's still a living growing person inside of you. After my surgery I was curious about how big my baby was. So I asked. Dr. Bells words were "It wasn't big enough to be considered a baby. It was just a growth." I was about 2 1/2 months pregnant. It was a baby. My baby. And since then I can't help but think of that every time I miscarry. It's depressing. He wasn't even concerned about how I felt. He just kept telling me that I was too fat and that I needed to lose weight. My husband was there with me the whole time. I got the worst possible care from Davis hospital. The nurses were total bitches. They didn't take care of me. My husband did. My stomach was just sliced open and they expected me to be able to get up and walk like it never happened. When I did walk my husband dragged my I.V. while I held the little pump that sucked up and leakage from my wound and the nurse held my catheter. I was in a little too much pain and asked the nurse to stop and she said that I was fine. I stopped and she kept walking almost pulling my catheter completely out. It was a nightmare. I'm just glad it's done and over with although I do feel a little empty at times. Especially since my cousin had her baby last week. I can't help but wonder how life would be if my husband and I had children. Lately the only thing I can do to keep myself busy is to concentrate on the craft and create new spells. Let me get off this computer and sulk to myself. Thanks for listening. Even if you don't know me.  Blessings, Moxi

      The other day I was flipping channels and happened to see a show called amazing animals on animal planet. This woman had a cat that woke her up because her apartment was on fire. Last night one of my cats was going nuts. Meow meow meow! At first I wanted her to just shut up. Then it clicked. Maybe something is wrong. So I got up and got dressed and looked around. Nothing was wrong so I laid back down. She was in my face again. Meow meow meow. Turns out nothing was wrong. She just wanted to crawl under the covers and wanted me to lift them up for her. Now if you think that's bad. She woke me up to let her under the covers. No big deal. But she didn't even want to cuddle with me. She wanted to cuddle with my husband. She did this all night and most of this morning. Amazing? I don't think so.  More like annoying.  Blessings, Moxi

      I'm so damn tired. My stupid neighbors have their radio blared up so damn loud. When I was younger I loved loud music. Sometimes I still do. But not this early in the morning. Maybe I wouldn't care if he listened to something decent...  1 sheepy sheepy... 2 sheepy sheepy... 3 sheepy sheepy...  I don't have a serta so I'm stuck counting sheep.  4 sheepy sheepy... 5 Sheepy sheepy...  Guess I'll try and sleep.  Blessings, Moxi

        My husband and I have been living in this duplex for almost 3 years. When we first moved in our neighbors at the time were awful. They were selling drugs and the women were selling themselves. We were able to get them evicted about 2 1/2 weeks after moving in. It was great. It was quiet for a little over a month. Then a lesbian couple moved in. It was still quiet. They honestly have been the best neighbors we have ever had. We got along great. We hung out together we partied together. I loved it. Then about 7 months after moving in they moved out. It was quiet for about 3 weeks. Then the neighbors from hell moved in. My husband and I have tried to be nice. We really have. Our new neighbor moved in with his teenage son in November of 2002. At the time he was 45 (now 47) and his kid was 17 (now 19). We'll call the older one Patrick and his son Alex. We live in a duplex. It's not the same as an apartment or the same as a house so a little common sense can go a long way. At the time they moved in my husband was working swings so we normally slept until sometime in the afternoon. 3 days after he moved in my husband and I were in bed sleeping when we woken up by a loud noise. BANG BANG BANG!! This ass starts banging on his drum set. Not playing...banging. Why have a drum set if you don't know how to play? Our walls are so thin you can hear almost everything that goes on in their half of the house. All the time with the loud music and the drums and now he's got an electric organ he loves to turn up. Yet another instrument he can't play. These people are trashy. He doesn't work. And when he does all his money goes to alcohol and drugs. He's only 47 and has already filed and used up all of his social security earnings. His mom pays for his rent. Sometimes they have up to 6 adults living in his one bedroom rental. Yet none of them seem to be able to work. What I really hate about this place is we have a shared basement. We used to have a washer down there because for awhile those were the only hook-ups available. No big deal right? WRONG!!! Even though they had their own washer they were using ours. Our electric and gas bill went up and we never had any hot water. I got so sick of it. I sure as hell didn't want the washer knowing his nasty clothes were in it. So we cut the power to our half of the basement from the breaker and cut the power cord so they couldn't use the washer. We bought a new washer and dryer and hooked them up in our back room. Problem solved? NO! They reconnected a power cord and plugged it into their half of the basement. We still had no hot water. My husband had to go to a hardware store and buy a plug and some cap to put on the water connection so they couldn't use it. So far it's worked. Then about 2 months ago my husband had to go down into the basement and turn the water off so he could fix our tub. He noticed an orange extention cord running from our half of the basement to the inside of the house. Now I know I said we cut the power the basement. Or at least we thought we did. All the lights on the main floor, upstairs and in the basement run on the same fuse. We didn't know that. When our bill went up almost $20 we didn't think anything of it. In the light socket on our half they had one of those things that allows you plug an electric cord into it. They had their power cut off due to non payment and was stealing ours. We couldn't cut the power to it because we needed our lights too. It really pissed me off because they were using our electricity to crank their radio up and piss us off. So we took care of that too. In the daytime when they had their radio cranked up we flipped the switch in the breaker and the music stopped. We were told to take pictures of the cord running from our half into their house for proof. So we did. And then we called to cops. It wasn't as simple as going down there and unplugging it. They would just plug it back in. These are drug addicts and alcoholics so confronting them was out of the question. It's just my husband and I. What can the 2 of us do against 6 drunk and high pricks? So like I said we called the cops. Then they have the nerve to get mad at us for calling the cops so they would stop using our electricity. They even threatened my husband. Alex is currently in jail for robbing and beating an elderly man for his money. It's so sad. He learned all that from his dad. His dad has been in and out of jail since he's moved in. And all the problems we have don't matter to our landlord. As long as he gets his rent money he doesn't care about anything. It's really sad. And now we're trying to keep his cat alive. When they first moved in their cat weighed about 12 pounds. He was healthy. Now he looks like he weighs no more than 3 pounds. He keeps his cat outside and never feeds him. So when we see him we feed him. If my husband and I didn't have 6 cats of our own we'd take him in. But we just can't do that. Patrick's cat has been losing his hair and we don't know if he's seriously sick. We want to catch him and take him to the vet so he can get better. We'd like to find him a good home. He deserves that. And he's so sweet. Even if all our neighbor did for that cat was put dry food out he wouldn't look as bad as he does now. It's only $8 for a 25lb. bag of dry cat food. But instead he chooses to spend it on alcohol and drugs. Sad really. Why have an animal when you can't even take care of yourself? I love every one of my 6 cats. I can't ever imagine mistreating them. My husband and I would starve before we'd let our cats go without food. Our cats always have food and water. Sometimes they get special cat milk. They almost always get treats and catnip. They have so many toys it's unreal. We even bought them a 7'2" house. My cats are spoiled. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Just knowing that I live next to such a loser sickens me. Not only is he sh*t but his cat is suffering. I hate that. I hate him. I know that hate is such a strong word. But I do. I hate Patrick. He's such a loser. He's 47 and still depending on his parents and the state because he's too lazy to work. He's a piece of sh*t and I hope he soon suffers the way his cat is. He deserves that.  Blessings, Moxi

      My husband works with a short fat ugly chick that claims she has a boyfriend. Not that that is the problem cause if that was the case I could care less. But when she claims they're getting married and he hasn't even proposed....COME ON!! "I've spent $1500 on a plate that serves 4 people." STUPID! Why plan a wedding when the guy hasn't even proposed? This chick makes me sick. She talks about herself too damn much. Normally people like this wouldn't bother me. But when she calls me fat behind my back to my husband when she doesn't even know me and she weighs like 500 lbs. herself it really pisses me off. She's pretty damn lucky my husband needs his job. Believe me my fist and foot would love to become close friends with her fat ass. She even had the nerve to ask my husband why I don't like her. Like it's that damn hard to figure out. Woo! It feels good to get that off my chest. And if that nasty slut just happens to read this....I have only 2 words for you : F**K YOU!!  Moxi
