      Lately I've noticed something. People are pissed off. It's perfectly acceptable, most people (with the exceptions of those living in say, Iraq) are free to express their beliefs in a peaceful manner. (In Iraq, one burst of gunfire means yes, two bursts means no.) So, I thought to myself, how can I get my own view across? Through media of course!   In the past, only the incredibly wealthy controlled newspapers. They got all the readers, they could preach what they believed, they could tell their contrived crackpot theories to the world. But that was then. Today, there are thousands of small community papers in circulation. However, these papers have a readership of zero. The only people who get their messages across are media barons like Rupert Murdoch or Conrad Black. Maybe things haven’t changed.  But wait! We have the internet!   Today, Blogs such as this are a wonderful means for one to get up on their own virtual soapbox. With the marvels of technology, anyone can have their own little rant. Of course, there being two hundred million other rants, just like it, whether it gets read or not, that's a different story.  Well there's my story, I don't know how much of this is interesting, but now you've read it and it's stuck in your head forever.  Haha.

      Trying to set up PHP nuke... doesn't seem to be working, I got ages to figure it out though...  I often wonder, why is it that we are always forced to check the little box that says we agree with the terms of whatever we sign up for? Noone ever reads them, the just check them off. They could be checking off a confession to being islamic militants, which would lead to them being dragged off. But they check them off anyways...

      Exams. With the exception of a few misguided individuals, they are one aspect of school that people would miss the least should the suddenly be removed from the system. Of course this is my opinion only having just finished this year’s exams. However for the first time ever, we the students have been required to take a double set of exams. Why? A wonderful little pain inflicting invention known as “Provincial Exams”   These extra exams are ones sent to all the schools by the Ministry of Education. However, if they were sent by the Ministry of Torture, I wouldn’t be surprised. These results do not reflect the marks of the students however. They go on a report card, but not ours.   These marks are used to determine which schools are the most “successful”. Every year, these results are published and the papers will speculate on how and why some schools perform better than others.   The papers usually comment on the teaching staff as the prime reason for a good showing. Chances are, they’re wrong. The real answer is something more simplistic than that. Remember how I mentioned the 2 sets of exams students are required to take? There’s a reason. One set of exams are the ones given out by the school. The others are provincial exams. Why take 2? One of them counts towards the student’s marks. The other, doesn’t.   Which leaves the question, why would anyone actually try on the provincial exam? If they don’t count towards your own mark, what incentive is there to try?  Why waste your time doing a test when you could be standing around playing pong in the school library?   Schools that fare poorly typically get funding to improve their programs, or rather they should. That gives students the incentive to do poorly in hopes of garnering more money for their school to spend towards academics, or coke machines. Which ever is more important.  Almost always, it’s the poor schools that do. They probably pay their students to actually try.
