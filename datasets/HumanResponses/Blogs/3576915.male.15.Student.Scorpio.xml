      Hey all.  I know i haven't been online for ages, and i'm probably a little slow on the uptake of things, but now it's time to catch up.  If i hurt you with what i say then that's too bad. Enjoy.  Let's start with: me. Surprise, surprise. i'm human. i'm not infallible. i know i can be a jerk. and believe me, i hate myself more than anyone ever will. Pst Mike's service has impacted many people, and i'm no exception. On our own we are nothing. God makes us who we are.  Next: Adam. Don't be ignorant. make everything you do deliberate, and assume responsibility if you've done wrong.  Timothy Wan. If at first you don't succeed, try again. even God can't please everyone. patience is the mother of virtue.  Brendan. Very glad you're learning stuff. whatever it is, it's time to grow up. don't take offence so easily. be proud of what God has made you, and use it as your edge.  You can't control the wind, but you can adjust your sail.   Juliana. If you can't say anything good, then it's probably not worth saying. don't be ignorant; you're not stupid. things only make you angry when you remember them. the best revenge is to  forget .  If i'm wrong about something, feel free to call to hurl obscenities at me. oh look, my sense of humour is back.

      Hey all.  Just felt that i needed a change, so i have deleted all previous posts. they were boring, anyway.  My grandmother is in the hospital again. she's been puking and having dizzy spells, and the doctors don't know exactly what's wrong with her. so much for modern technology.  Read the  Da Vinci Code  by Dan Brown. interesting book. it argues that Jesus was not divine, and that the church invented his divinity. Also argues that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. well i'm not going to go in depth to argue anything, but i think Dan Brown made lots of mistakes in his assumptions. for example, he writes that Peter was the one in the picture " The Last Supper " who was making threatening gestures. apparently that man is Judas Iscariot, not Simon Peter. that explains a lot about the hand gestures.  Anyways, there's a reason why the book is under the fiction section in book shops and libraries.  Thinking of getting a new cpu.  Thinking of you, too.  Bye all.
