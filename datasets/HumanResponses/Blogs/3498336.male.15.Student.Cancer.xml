       Well, today was the first day of summer band.. I think it went by pretty fast.. well it was only two hours.. but still.  Theres A LOT of trumpets! ah! like 40 or something. I didn't remember there being so many last year.. maybe there weren't.. but OK.. Mr. Merritt made me be the model for Remington going-up.. I hate playing in front of people.. well.. it wasn't that bad..We played the opener.. and like no one was getting letter E right.. well the first kinda were.. we still messed up though.. and yah  Matt and Chris taught the fish the Indian song and some other stuff.. that was interesting..  Well thats about all that happened today at Summer Band... WOO......

         I haven't updated my blog in a while.. so I thought I would now. There's not really anything to say.. but i can try.      Summer Band starts tomorrow.. meaning my summer is over.. I'm kind of looking for to Summer Band because I'll get to see everyone, but I'm not looking forward to it cuz i don't feel like practicing eight hours everyday! I guess I'll have to get over it.. there's nothing I can do about that..cuz i guess it'll pay off at Nationals! wooo      I'm officially sick of my Rock/Pop playlist.. I've listened to Simple Plan way too much.. so now i'm sick and tired of it.. and I don't feel like listening to Classical music.. so I guess I'm stuck with rock.. unless I wanna listen to Hip-Hop and Rap.. not really.. hmm.. maybe i'll find some cool music in the next few days..      Tomorrow we're gonna find out what its like to be without Margie :-( but there's nothing I can do about that.. Well i guess it won't really be tomorrrow.. cuz last year she missed summer band.. so I guess when school starts we'll really know that Margie's gone..      I've started To Kill a Mockingbird.. it takes FOREVER to read!! lol can't do anything about it.. I'm on like page 15.. something about Boo Radley.. i think thats the neighbors nephew or something.. don't really remember.. I should read somemore :-P I don't want to though! at least we don't have to read ALL of the books on the list over the summer.. the summer that ends tomorrow! NO!!!! but we'll still have weekends.. and I'm going to AstroWorld! and hopefully to see The Village.. I wanna ride SWAT! that ride is soooo awesome.. you should ride it sometime.      I'm probably boring you to death.. but thats OK! I'm having fun typing.. i guess... kinda not really.. but its funner than just sitting here staring at the monitor doing nothing..      OOOO a new Degrassi episode on Friday!! and a new Girls v. Boys too! and we get to find out what degrassi stars made it on Girls v. Boys.. w00t!!!!! you should watch these shows sometime.. they are on The-N (Noggin) yup its great.. lalalala      I think thats enough writing for today.. I'll give an update about summer band tomorrow.. yey.. I bet you're looking forward to THAT post. ;);)

       I love this song   Another day is going by I'm thinking about you all the time But you're out there And I'm here waiting  And I wrote this letter in my head 'Cuz so many things were left unsaid but now you're gone And I can't think straight  This could be the one last chance To make you understand  I'd do anything Just to hold you in my arms To try to make you laugh Somehow I can't put you in the past I'd do anything Just to fall asleep with you Will you remember me? 'Cuz I know I won't forget you  Together we broke all the rules Dreaming of dropping out of school And leave this place to never come back  So now maybe after all these years If you miss me have no fear I'll be here I'll be waiting  This could be the one last chance to make you understand And I just can't let you leave me once again  I'd do anything Just to hold you in my arms To try to make you laugh Somehow I can't put you in the past I'd do anything Just to fall asleep with you Will you remember me? 'Cuz I know I won't forget you    I close my eyes And all I see is you I close my eyes I try to sleep I can't forget you nanana (...) And I'd do anything for you    I'd do anything Just to hold you in my arms To try to make you laugh Somehow I can't put you in the past I'd do anything Just to fall asleep with you  I'd do anything To fall asleep with you I'd do anything There's nothing I won't do I'd do anything To fall asleep with you I'd do anything 'Cuz I know I won't forget you   :'( I miss you Margie!

       Well today was kind of boring I guess..  Yesterday I went to the big new Ikea.. omg its huge lol people were parking like anywhere it was soo crowded, but we got extremely lucky and got a spot like 3 parkings spots away from the entrance. I bought a new desk.. and my 'rents got some chairs for the living room. hmm.. all last night I built my desk.. and then I went to bed because that wore me out lol.  Then today I put my computer and stuff on my desk, and cleaned up my room because everything from my desk was everywhere. Then I had a dentist appointment at 10:30 and they still think I need to get braces :-(. i DON'T want them.. that would suck.. cuz of band.. I might be getting them in May. Then I would have all summer to get used to playing with them. :-(;:)      Then I was kind of bored the rest of the day until like 4:30. I read some of To Kill a Mockingbird.. and then before I left for band, and I had some vanilla ice cream with whipped cream.. but it was kind of weird.. I dunno.. it wasn't old.. but it was weird.. the whipped cream like left this stuff on the spoon.. and well that ice cream kinda grossed me out... maybe I shouldn't eat anymore of it.. well at least it wasn't like rotten or something and I didn't get sick and throw up at band.. that would've sucked..  Well, band was a lot less demanding today.. lol.. well except for playing.. my lips were still dead afterwards.. like they always are.. damn high notes! there's a reason to hate first part.. lol.. grr Well outside practice was kind of fun today I guess.. well for the hour we were outside cuz then it started raining at like 8 so we had to go in.. and PRACTICE MORE MUSIC! damn music and high notes! lol well the opener sounds awesome.. and I want to try and find the music for the closer.. is it called Wild Nights?.. I'll look on iTunes.. I wanna learn more drill! thats the best part.. cuz i HATE fundamental block :-(. no new drill today :( we worked on the only 4 sets the trumpets have! lol (10-13) stupid props! well i guess since we're behind a prop for 9 sets then we don't have to really worry about style as much for the beginning.. unless a judge is back there.. =-0   Ok that's enough for today.. I guess I'll go search for Wild Nights.. and maybe someone will get online and talk to me! its only 11:52!

       Well 8 hour band is finally over! woo! lol Well yesterdays practice wasn't so bad.. lol cuz we got to set 10 where the trumpets come out behind the props so now we actually get to learn drill.. woo hoo.. but i have this giant 12 count move when the block shrinks down.. o well.. i guess i have to get used to it.. Hmm i tried playing the region music.. its harder than last years.. i think.. well i only practiced it for like 2 minutes.. go me.. lol  Hmm.. theres a band barbecue today at Northshore.. and I wanna go.. but I don't feel like going lol I dunno.. i do but i don't.. hmm.. well i have like 20 minutes to decide if i'm going lol.. well I decided i'm gonna go... so I'm gonna go get dressed..  Oh and don't bother reading my schedule from the other day.. cuz i got changed to French 45 mintues.. so I'm pretty sure that will be second period with health and speech.. so yah.. everything will be moved around..

(long story).. well to make a long story short.. all the lifeguards were like random people not in lifeguard clothes.. on thunderrun it was this like 12 year old kid.. so were all like uh.. its a gang.. lol... well hanna thought of it.. then we ate some food.. and susie and lauren got a huge snow cone.. it was like BAM in your face big.. lol we all had to eat some to finish it :-p... and then we dared Susie to drink the like jucie at the bottom.. lol it was like a mix of bubblegum, grape, lime, and cherry.. she got 1.50 for that hahaha.. she said it was kinda good.. even though lauren was like dying next to her when she died the bubblegum.. :-p  well.. that was during the day.. now its 2 AM lol more like 2:30.. me and phil found out something new about a friend (no names.. unless he/she doesn't care and i can add his/her name later..)lol even though phil was a little confused.. and then we got delirious.. and then phil left..so thats about all that happened today.. o  i watched Paycheck earlier.. that was pretty good i guess .. I kinda liked The Village too.. even though IT WASN'T SCARY!.. i just like the weird twist it had to the story.. that was kinda surprising.. well I guess I've written enough for today.. lalalalala back to doing nothing
