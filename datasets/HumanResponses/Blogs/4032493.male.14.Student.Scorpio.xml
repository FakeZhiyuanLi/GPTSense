      This is a new segment that I will call "If I ruled the world..." Basically it is what I would change to better society. Usually it is just something that has been pissing me off. My first Installment is called: "If I ruled the world: Crying Children In Movie Theaters." Enjoy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If I ruled the world: Crying Children In Movie Theaters    &nbsp;  Lets face it. Most people like enjoying a movie. When I go to the movies these are usually the things that make it a good experience:   - A dark theater  -&nbsp;When everyone turns off their cell phones  - No fatass sitting next to me&nbsp;who hasn't showered in 3 months and is eating a 50 gallon&nbsp;bucket of popcorn  -&nbsp;No one talking...At all.&nbsp;But especially&nbsp;someone talking&nbsp;about what is about to happen 10 seconds before it happens  - A quiet theater   Hmmmm...Now lets just think about that last one for a minute. I could have made a 50 page list of things that fit under that general subject. The main thing I hate about that is  parents bringing crying children to the movies .   Everyone knows about what I am talking about. The one very "responsible" parent who brought their 2 month old child to the theater. If you didn't realize that I was being scarcastic suicide is still an option. Please remove yourself from the gene pool. Anyway, I think that this is what goes on at the hospital when a child of two idiots is born:   Man: "Wow look how cute he is..."  Woman: "Life is so beautiful."  Man: "I know...Anyway lets hurry up and cut the cord so we can all go see a movie."   I'm sorry, but that is my only explanation for what is going on. I really don't care if you bring a newborn to a G/PG rated flick...But a PG-13 and R? What the fuck is wrong with you?!? This&nbsp; happens all the time in these kinds of movies. What the hell are the theater owners thinking when they sell little&nbsp;fresh out the womb&nbsp;Timmy&nbsp;a ticket?...   I mean,&nbsp;what kid wouldn't want to be traumatized 5 minutes after birth?   That is why if I was the ruler of the world I make taking your newborn&nbsp;child to the movies illegal. Not only that, but if found guilty&nbsp;the sentence&nbsp;will always&nbsp;be instant capital punishment....By firing squad.&nbsp;       - OrcSolidSnake
