      well yesterday i got a call from an ex. somebody that i totally blew off for no reason. i really really cared about him, and that's not easy for me. i have cared so much for him for 4 years. this summer he tried to get back with me, but i was too afraid to be with him because i had no clue what to do about my feelings. i just pretended like nothing was there. that was easier to do than to let him back in.  well, we've been talking about issues and tonight is when we really talked. he knows me. and i like to think that i know him. he gets me and puts up with all my stupid crap. i've realized that i don't want to just be with anyone that come around. i want to be with one person. and that's him.  i'm being so sappy, and for those who know me, u know that i'm soooo not like this!

       I am so sick of my mom sometimes. i wanted to tell my story about something that had happened today to my dad, and she kept interrupting me, and then she was just like fuck u.. i was like what? i don't have any idea what i do wrong to her. i am rude to her alot, i know that, but it's because she has changed so much. my mom used to be my best friend, and for the past couple of years, it's like we've totally lost that. ever since i got my license, we've gone even farther back and i just don't get it. she doesn't want to let me go. give me freedom. i believe i've been rebelling against her and her ideas of how i should be lately, and i feel totally guilty about that. i wish i could talk to her, but she either gets her feelings hurt or she gets mad. i don't know what to do.

       hi everyone! i'm starting this only because clayton TOLD me to start it.. i'm a little late, but it's aiight! for my very first bloggy thingy, i'm going to respond to a certain other person's blog.      ok, so i'm in a van, making out and all naked and he's naked and we're about to have some fun.       until he puts on the condom.      that's when he loses his.. um.. self. now in the past year or so i've done some bad stuff and i've had a little fun, but i've NEVER EVER felt as dirty and just downright slutty as i did at that moment. he could not get it back up. his reason: i miss *ex girlfriend*. what the hell? what girl would not feel absolutely shitty about that remark? so you're saying that i'm so repulsive that u can't even forget about your ex for a few minutes?      maybe i'm just insenstive. maybe i should've been a little more understanding. but not to a guy that then turned around and told several people about the little incident. he also went and told someone that he couldn't get it up because he just wasn't attracted to me. which was it? i'm fucking ugly or you're overly emotional? hmm..
