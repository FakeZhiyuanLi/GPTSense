      Are you ever in a situation that the harder you push, the more nothing happens?  I'm in that situation right now and it's frustrating as hell.  I can see all the inefficiencies the situation leads to, all the trodden on toes and snubbed noses and all for no Just Cause.  It sucks, the whole damn thing.  Sucks like an bright yellow translucent ultraleach from the planet Gweegthsthle III.  I wonder whether Gravity was really such a good idea.  If anyone comes up with an alternative, I'd be pleased to hear them out.

      Avril Lavigne's 'Sk8er Boi' is perfect reprisal for Thomas Dolby's 'Europa and the Pirate Twins'.     "Thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges"  - Shakespeare, "The Taming of the Shrew"  As I have noticed though, some people, being full of themselves, are their own vengance.

      Sometimes there are good days and sometimes there are bad, and then there are days like these - no real wind to speak of, no dragons to fight, no Birthday cake.  Status: indeterminate.    On days like these, home is a pretty conceit.

      Well, I had oodles to say and now I sit down to post, it's all dried up.  Must have eaten too much I guess.  Anyway, here I am, all the way from circlesquare.blogspot.com, which I'm putting out to pasture because I fancied a fresh look and, well, because life is change.  So there you are.

      I was, in as much it is possible to do so, given the context, looking forward to my McDonald's Quorn Supreme, which leapt forth from the counter menu as a lively and colourful item, unlike the animal protein-based products served there, which are limp and appropriately, lifeless, no matter how well prepared.  One can hope for too much it seems:  The focaccia bun was ultra-processed and had no levity; the quorn steak itself was a mean-spirited sliver and the salad garnish was presented in standard warm and limp mode.  The saving grace was the chilli condiment which slaked my thirst for some zing, not found in the rest of the sandwich. I refer only in passing to the fries as that's all they deserve (ie. passing).

      It's great, sometimes, to shed the mantle of parenthood, (having passed that safely to someone else appropriately-qualified) and just do what you want all day.  Today was such a day and the peace and freedom from responsibility was well overdue.  So what did we do? Drive, walk, shop, eat, drive.  That breakdown doesn't seem so different from circumstances  avec les infants  yet it cost more, somehow.  What a worrying thought...perhaps I won't retire after all.

      If anyone would like to give me a reliable method of maintaining an abundance of different username/password combinations without recourse to pen and parchment or equivalent digital means of preservation, I would be most obliged.  The Internet age is great, an' all that, but it's Achilles heel is the need to prove identity with such a clunky mechanism.  We need ubiquitous retinal or fingerprint scanners.  Of course, it would be lovely if everything could be done on trust...oh I'm SO naive.

      For those of you unsuccessful in finding a gmail account invitation, I have one or two to give away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave your e-mail address in the comment field and I'll send&nbsp;invitations until I'm out of stock.&nbsp; One per person, reserved for people partial to red wine and chocolate.

      &nbsp;Great, now we can do more funky stuff to posts without needing a degree in HTML.&nbsp; 'Bout time too:&nbsp;the 'Post'&nbsp;GUI has&nbsp;caught up with the rest of Blogger, which, in it's latest iteration rocks.&nbsp;Wizzy it izzy. Just, please everyone,&nbsp; let's agree not to do rainbow letters in every post jus' 'cus&nbsp;we can, huh?&nbsp; Unless you want to, that is.
