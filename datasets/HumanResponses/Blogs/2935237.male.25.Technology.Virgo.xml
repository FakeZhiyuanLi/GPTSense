      Travelling in a train in the subway is like being in a pessimistic persons mind. Everything outside is dark! The best way to entertain is, listening to music or reading a book. Currently, I am reading a Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry. The blog is just  a description of my commute today from home to work.    ===================== Damn this elevator. It’s slow. Wish `was like one in my office. Its late. Dukhi is listening about the fate of the Bhola. Lucky Bhola. His fingers salvaged his hands. Doing without the fingers is much better than without the hand. Sigh!.The lights have to turn green right when I have to cross. While the gap on the roads were being filled by the cars, the gaps in Dukhi’s understanding about the world were being filled by the daily conversation of Dhuki's father and mother at supper. Oops the snow. Why does it have to turn to ice! Dukhi's mother is fasting. Whenever she said that it meant there was not much food. Horrible! The train driver cannot leave the doors open for one more sec. Dukhi had learnt to bring the carcass and remove the hide and tan it. The meat of the carcass is delicious. But it’s hard to get dead cattle. The do not die often. Yikes! People dont even realize. Why do they have to always stand right near the door? Move in folks!! Make room! Dukhi's wife would steal the milk for Ishvar every night. The nights are pitch dark but a mother would do anything for the kid. Dukhi wondered if he should offer to do it. But he lay indifferent. He also lay in oblivion as the mother was mishandled by the chokidar in the orchard. This is pathetic!! I chose the wrong car. This car does not have air conditioning. Ishvar was excited to have gotten the chance to accompany his dad to bring the carcass home. Dukhi had instructed Ishvar to stay close and observe what they did. But the cow was alive. Ishvar's cheek was pierced by the horns. They traded the carcass to survive. Etrade! Americas` best e-broker. Ting! Thank god the office elevator is not as slow.

      * The necessary condition for life is survival, the sufficient condition is happiness.  * When you are thinking you are surviving. When you are not, you are happy

      The thing that amazes me most, is the tranformation from an abstract thought ,lacking tangibility, to a concrete realization. It is magic. From nothing to something. It is like solidfying the air. The air, we cannot touch. The air, we cannot see. Yet we know it is there.   That which is tangible, we call it reality. The abstract is like energy. The energy somehow gets transformed into an electron or a proton. A particle ! The tangible comes to life. A body losing life is similar to an electron losing its energy.   If there is one thing that is abundantly available in this universe, it is energy. Energy is beyond space. Simply because it does not occupy any.    It is difficult to comprehend the abstract , because "thinking", which is used for comprehension, itself is abstract

       Working on a Saturday  I realized how refreshing it can be coming to the office on a Saturday!! I had to come to work to cover if something were to go wrong. And good Lord!! Nothing yet. And that is the precise reason why I am blogging!! I got so many thing done! Bills. Bank accounts. Emails to friends. Blogs. Notes to myself. And if I were at home, I would still be in my bed! Later in the day I would have gone to the gym, watched a few movies and met friends and felt bored at how I passed my weekend in the same old way! But this is good. The day begun early and I am chilling!! Listening to music. Simple pure relaxation!     - Kandarp

       SIMPLICITY    The obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses it simply. -Khalil Gibran. Simplicity is a very important virtue all programmers should possess. Arriving at a solution that is simple is a non trivial task. The simplest solutions are the most elegant. Simplicity requires breaking up each difficulty into as many parts as feasible and necessary to resolve it. The solutions to the most difficult of the problems lie in simplicity. Never should one be afraid to roll back to a simpler solution if and when one becomes available.

       CONFUSION    Confusion is a very good thing. People think, confusion is bad. That complexity is bad. But being in a state of confusion or dealing with complexity, means, you are trying out something new, something different and something which you do not know whether will be a success or just a learning experience. How can assimilating something new, exploring something new, be a bad thing. No matter what the outcome, the end of confusion is always clarity. And clarity of mind is a great feeling to have. It is like having hot cup of tea on a hot summer day. When tea gets over, you feel good!!   >> Someone pointed out that I should be giving Kudos to the source of this post! It has been done !!!

      Comparing humans/life to a log floating in the river is not a good analogy. Because log itself does not know that it is in a river and that it is flowing. But we do. we also know that there is land around. And at times we swim out of river ,call it time out, and sit on the land and see the river flow. Try to understand where the river is flowing why the river is flowing.  Aftersometime you dive back and at times try to swim against the flow. At times with the flow. But the important thing to realize is that the log can float. WE have to swim.  There are not rules in life. As bhai says we have been tagged all our life. Our happiness is tagged with the fulfilment of desires. I think it takes almost a life time to realize that happiness and desires are not connected and at times even more.

      Why do relationships break ? Why do they do not work out ? Do you have to make them work ? I have been in United States for the past three years. I was alien to the concept of a break up. And believe me I am not kidding, I was introduced to words like "going out", "making it work" , "break up" only recently and I am 25. By now you have guessed that I have lived a great chunk of my life in India. I am not saying that relationships do not break in India. Nor am I great fan of arranged marriages. No matter where they break, they break because of one fundamental reason. Lack of faith. Here in the United States and especially amongst Men, "going out" is a fashion. It is a status symbol amongst their other guy friends. The same thing exists to a lesser degree amongst girls also. What ends up happening is that they "try". And in trying they stop being honest to themselves. Most relationships do not work out simply because the characters involved were not honest to themselves. They do not have faith in themselves and in their relationship.   Being in love is such a wonderful experience. And what people have done? They have ruthlessly quantized this experience. How do you fall in love? You "start talking". Then you "hang out". And then after a bit of thought you go out. And when you go out you have a relationship. Where is lovein all this ? Where is faith ? Where is the friendship ?

      This city is amazing. It is beyond comparison. There is wealth, there is glamour, there is diversity and there is the subway. If you wakeup from your sleep on your way home, you may find an African American to your left, a Chinese blocking the sight of a Jew sitting across. A Scottish in deep conversation with a Jamaican, a Pakistani catching up on sleep and an Indian, lost in himself, within. They are all New Yorkers! Together but not united! This city has a lot of energy - both negative and positive.  Its nights are brighter than the days. Your mornings start in a crowd on a train whose faces suck all the energy out of you. You feel it is the end of the day even before it has started. Chances are that you are not alone but you are lonely. If there is anything you want on this earth, you will mostly likely find here. You can find musicians on the train and performers on the street. Every street and avenue is famous for its rareness. Broadway for is its performances and 28th for its cuisines, 8th Ave for hookers, Time Square for its timelessness and Wall street for being a wall that is street!  It is neither an empire nor a state but it has the Empire State within.  This city holds the gold of all the nations of the world underneath itself. And besides all this you may be lucky to find some peace of mind also!  It is the eye of the world. Yes it is the big apple!

      They say when you follow your heart the whole universe conspires to realize your dreams! And they say you have to watch out for omens on your search for dreams. And you have to enjoy each moment of your search. The heart may tell you that it is feeling sad. But you have to tell you heart not to feel sad. Because you are following your dream. But what if you do not have a dream ? Or may be what if your heart does not desire. This happens where there is indifference, where there is fear of failure! You cannot listen to your heart in these conditions.   Boredom is caused by indifference, indifferece  by inaction, inaction by inertia, inertia by fear and fear by ego.  Ego is present when you see yourself as  one and finte. Because there can be many finite ones. When you see yourself as one and infinite there is no ego there is no boredom and that is what living is all about. Happiness!
