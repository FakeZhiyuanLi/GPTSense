						    Most books on Capricorns say that Capricorns are serious, tedious workaholics who climb steadily and surely up the mountain to their goals. I scoffed every astrology book that claims that about Capricorns. 

  I'm  a Capricorn, and all my life, I had never been a steady and sure mountain-climber. I was a lazy bum without any goals that lasted five months. To my point of view, I was as far as possible from the traditional Capricorn. 

 Then I read a book that said a little more about Capricorns. Sure, Capricorns climb up mountains, surely and steadily, but only when they have found their goal. Most  young  Capricorns, who have yet to find their goals and dreams, tend to be listless, lazy bums that turn workaholic overnight when they have objectives in sight. 

 The book also said that there were actually two types of Capricorns. The positive side of the coin are the mountain goats who climb up to achieve their dreams, steadily and surely. The negative side of the coin are nanny and billy goats who are pegged to the ground, going round and round and round, never actually getting anywhere. 

 For years, I've been the nanny goat. I've been running round and round without a goal I believe in, without a dream I want down to my bones. Then I found my goals and dreams, but I was still running around as a nanny goat, because I didn't know how to get rid of the tether that held me back. My negative self-image, my ignorance, and my arrogance were ropes that tied me to my peg so tightly, I couldn't even see the way out. 

 Now I feel like I'm a nanny goat who has just learnt to untie a few of those ropes that pegged me down. I can feel my opportunity to turn into a mountain goat nearing. Maybe I'm even now at the bottom of my mountain, and I've already taken the first few steps towards my dreams. 

 I feel excited and full of hope. I must remember however, not to fall into despair if I fall. Only the mountain matters. I must climb it, no matter how often I fall. That's the secret to being a mountain goat. 

 It's not that mountain goats don't fall. It's that they refuse to stop climbing the mountain no matter how difficult or scary it gets. I can smell the fresh air now. I can smell the freedom of being on the mountain. 

 I refuse to return to the limitations of being a nanny goat, no matter how safe and comforting it feels. In the end, nanny goats get slaughtered, while mountain goats roam free.

						    So here I am, typing out blog posts. 

 I should be announcing the world that I'm up and blogging once more. 

 Except that I'm waiting until I've got my HANIcomb and my pretty face up. 

 Except that those things aren't up yet. 

 Because I can't be arsed to. 

 Damn it, I'm hanging out with my boyfriend too often, when I start saying "I can't be arsed to." 

 I really do have more important things to do than put pictures of my bosom on my blog. 

 Except that I'm not doing any of those important things either.

						    At age thirteen, when I invited friends over, I'd tell them: "Self-service!" 

 I wasn't a very good host. 

 I remember someone being shocked when I came back from New York and was actually serving her drinks like a semi-proper host. 

 I was the family baby in Malaysia. When guests came, my elder sisters did all the drink-serving and small-talking. Everyone just told me to get out the way. 

 It was only in New York, when Mom had to rely solely on Adik and I, while entertaining guests, that I picked up the skills of a host. So, while Mom planned the party and entertained the guests, Adik and I made sure the food and drinks were continuously available, and I even picked out poor lone-wolf guests and brought them into Mom's fold. 

 I enjoy the running of a party. There's so many balls to juggle, and it's fun to juggle them. 

 But I have yet to master  planning  a party. Me and plans don't do very well. I'm more a trouble-shooter. If we're suddenly out of Coke, I'll suddenly pop up with a solution. But to figure out how much Coke we'll actually need? 

 Erm, why don't we all just go clubbing?

						    I've been thinking on discretion, and I think HANIdiscretion should be defined as: 

 Anything that HANI's Mommy can read. 

 Now, that sounds  very  discreet. 

 The problem with  that  level of discretion is that there's very little about myself that I can then blog about. But what the hell. We'll see how it goes.

						    This is my first proper post to my new Movable Type blog. 

 It feels weird. 

  I  feel weird. 

 I haven't blogged in a really long time, and I don't feel like  really  blogging the way I used to. I must practice "discretion." That's the word. 

 Why the hell I have to practice "discretion" for, anyhow? Well, because apparently,  in discretions get people into trouble. Have yet to encounter indiscreet troubles, but I have been assured that they exist. 

 Being prudent, if not discreet, I bumble along, trying to figure out how to practice "discreet blogging." 

 At least it's an exciting new challenge....

						    Hello world! This is HANI. 

 Actually, HANI did not write the above sentences.  urlLink Tariq  did. Just because he owns the site, he thinks he can mess with my blog.

						    Here's a moment of HANIhistory! I'm finally going to state my political position! Anyway, it was the boyfriend who pointed me to  urlLink The Political Compass  and had me finally committing to a position through the quiz provided by that website. 

 Other than the specific topic of education, I normally hate thinking or discussing politics. As a kid, I watched and listened to my parents and their friends discuss Malaysian politics. I listened to my grandparents' stories of the upheaval they went through, in the times of the Japanese occupation and communist threats. I haven't stopped listening. I haven't stopped watching. 

 I've spent so much time listening and watching that I never voiced my own political opinions or sought out my own political experiences. Truthfully, I have other priorities. After all, if you want to change the world, you have to start with yourself; I'll be the first to admit that my self needs a lot of work. 

 So here's the results from  urlLink The Political Compass :
 Economic Left/Right: -0.88
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -4.05 

 That means I'm a Libertarian with a slight left leaning. 

 In actual terms, my political beliefs are similar to my beliefs on raising children. When a baby is trying to walk, I'll just make sure all fatal things are out of the way, and let the baby stumble and totter around as much as it likes. And really, that's what I'd like my government to do. Make sure the environment is safe enough for all of us to make fools of ourselves to our hearts' content. Comparing the government to a parent, I want the government to also provide good education. 

 Alas, at the moment, Malaysia doesn't provide safety nor education that is good enough to satisfy me. But as I said before, I'm too busy worrying about me right now, to give a shit about the world at large. So here's my rare political voice, shutting up  now .

						    I used to be obsessed with blogging. 

 I spent  hours  on blogs. I'd read other people's blogs, write my own posts, and fiddle through my html. I actually visited every single link on my blogroll  daily . I changed my images and quiz results manually, through html. Blogs ate up a serious chunk of my life. 

 At first, it was just fun. It felt like an accomplishment, and a way to enhance camaderie with my blogging friends. Then it became an obligation. First, to read other people's blogs, then when  urlLink Aiz  labeled me Queen of Bloggers, an obligation to  post . It became a responsibility that I had to fulfill. 

 I've come to realize that all this obligation is imaginary and delusional. So I've eased back on my personal mental bullshit. Now, I can't be arsed to even put up images. And don't make me look at tags. I see tags and my eyes glaze over. 

 If people are disappointed at the lack of HANIposts, they can just go find other blogs. If I end up clueless at friends' thoughts and doings, they can just call me and personally update me. 

 HANI has some seriously better things to do than look at tags. Like actually  going out  with bloggers. 

 HANI also has other things she  should  do. Like studying for exams....

						    "When the cat's away, the mice come out to play." 

 That's the saying. (That's  approximately  the saying. I can't remember things exactly. Anyway--) 

 The mice played for four wonderful days, and they were pleased. It had been so long since they had been able to truly let loose and just  play . 

 Always, they tip-toed when they ventured out, lest the cat spotted them. Always, they stayed quiet, lest the cat heard them. Always, they had to hide in their little mouse holes, lest the cat felt them. 

 At first, when the cat first came, it had been very difficult. Such constant control. Such repetitive repression. The mice felt they would go mad. 

 But gradually, it became second nature. Always tip-toeing. Always quiet. Always hiding. The actions became ingrained until they forgot that such things weren't usual. 

 At first, when the cat went away, the mice didn't know what to do.  They had forgotten how to thump the floor. They had forgotten how to screech and squeal. They had forgotten how to run around in the sun. They had forgotten how to play. 

 So they invited other mice, from other places, to play. And for two days, the mice from other places taught them all they had forgotten. And when the mice from other places left, for the next two days, the mice who now remembered how to play, played with the desperation of mice who knew what it was to forget playing. 

 The cat came back, and the mice tip-toed, quieted themselves, and hid. Though they could not play once more, they were not sad. 

 They were glad. They were content. They had played and played, and they were sure that this time, they will never forget what it was like to play. They had hope once more, and they knew, it wasn't only cats who could go away. 

 What would the cat do, when the mice are away?

						    Wow. On June 17 of this year, 2004, I will have officially blogged for exactly three years. That day is the last day of my final exams. So it will be a good time to party. 

 To commemorate this event, and for lack of better content, I shall put up right here, a reproduction of my very first blog post. 

  Today, I went to Tariq's for lunch. Ate  pulut kuning , yum! That's a Malaysian delicacy to the foreign folks! Means "yellow sticky rice." 

 After that, we went to buy me a new pair of glasses. :) Check it our folks, you might see me with new glasses on-going next week! Silver, with clip-on shades! Cost RM800 (US$235.29). I'm hoping my mother won't kill me. It was the RM320 (US$84.21) frames. I could have gotten RM165 (US$43.42) frames, but they weren't clip-on and they were cheap never-last type.... Surely mother cannot blame me for investing in a good pair of glasses? 

 After that, Tariq and I rewarded ourselves by a visit to  Kino-Kuniya , the ultimate bookstore of Kuala Lumpur City Center.... 

 Then I scavenged dinner from family members, picked up some books, came back to my computer to chat to everybody! 

 Got to talk to Yu San, and Zurina, and Lilian, and Nina! And then voila, she conned me into blogs. ARGH!  

 Loads and lots of gratitude to Grandmother of Malaysian Bloggers,  urlLink Nina , for persuading me to take up this journey.

						    I made the mistake of sleeping very late last night. 

 Well, my plan was just to ride roller coasters until lunch, have lunch, watch Shrek II after that, and then just go home. 

 I forgot that when one goes to Berjaya Times Square, one's basically doing a  lot  of walking. I forgot that when one goes to KLCC on a Sunday to watch a movie, you have to deal with a  lot  of people. I also forgot that when a day turns out good, people tend to want to prolong it as long as possible. 

 So, I've been out of the house from 9a.m. until way past 10p.m., on about three hours' sleep. 

 I am  exhausted . But it was all worth it, because today was a very satisfying day.

						    That's why we gossip about him so consistently. 

 And today's story on Mr. X was provided directly from Princess B, who tells us that Mr. X refused to believe her when Princess B explained to him that breasts hurt. 

 Yup. Ladies and gentlemen, breasts hurt. 

 But Mr. X doesn't believe this statement. 

 Princess B apparently went to great lengths in her attempts to convince Mr. X, including comparing the sensitivity of breasts to the sensitivity of the testes and scrotum. Mr. X was said to be convinced that "nuts," as he referred to testicles, have nothing in common with female bosoms. 

 Princess B told Mr. X to ask other people, but Mr. X declined to follow this suggestion.

						    As everyone knows, Tariq comments on blogs under the name T-Boy. I think this name needs changing, however. 

 As a woman has pointed out today, Tariq isn't a boy. I quote: "You're a  man ." 

 But considering all he is to me, and all I love about him, I think from now on, I'll refer to T-Boy by a new title: 

 T-Toy!

						    I was at KLIA's McDonald's for dinner tonight. Sending parents off to Adik's graduation ceremonies. 

 To my delight, both my fries and my nuggets came freshly cooked and piping hot. 

 It occurred to me that my dinner was like the rest of my day today: 

 Fresh and hot.

						    My computer is driving me nuts. 

 It's in the corner of the huge ball/kenduri/living room which is just too large to air-condition. And the fan is ineffective in this heat. 

 So I am suffering while sitting here at the computer. 

 I can't stand it. And since most of my work consists of sitting in front of the computer, I'm not getting it done. 

 I'm miserable. I hate the heat. I hate sweating. 

 I hate whining.

						    In the middle of a dark club, standing beside (or on top of!) a stereo bigger than me, the beat pumps into directly into my heart and drives my blood to my head and my groin. 

 The music and the tempo builds and builds and builds, while you're writhing in your own sweat. Adrenaline surges throughout your body, and you keep on dancing with the beat, until you're begging for release. 

 At that very moment, the music will suddenly break. The beat stops and you think even your heart stops. It's like an orgasm of the mind. 

 You pant and pant, anticipating the next surge of music and rhythm. You scream. You shout. You wait and wait and wait. Seconds ago, you were begging for the music to ease. Now you're begging for the music to start again. 

 And it does. And it brings you high and low and high and low, like waves of orgasms that don't stop until the dawn.

						    I think that every breath I am about to take will be an extremly arduous task. Yet somehow the next breath is always drawn, as if when I exhale, air just enters the lungs to fill up the emptiness. Breathing is more effortless than anything else on earth. 

 Yet every time before that breath is inhaled, I am fooled into thinking it will be arduous. 

 My throat feels dry. All the secret places of my body tingle, and my ears strain, expecting magical music to tinkle. 

 Yet everything is silent. 

 I brace myself for my next breath. 

 But that's as always, a pointless act. Suddenly I realize the reason for my constant misperception. I somehow confused breathing with living. 

 Breathing is so easy. Living is the biggest challenge we'll ever face.

						    Oh well. Luckily it's just Jikon. 

 Alas, knowing my community as I do, you can bet the neighbourhood moms know each other. Then again, my mom knows everybody's mom. Or at least their uncle. 

 But Jikon! Now that you know where I live, there's no excuse for not meeting up with me any longer! 

 Now, we're just waiting for those scary internet stalkers to find me....

						     urlLink Mama  called. She wanted to know my bank account number. Apparently she intends to send more money. 

 I don't know what is going on in that woman's head, but it's  still  not screwed on properly. 

 I mean, there's nothing that brings me the same kind of joy as money, but money was never what I wanted from Mama. From parents, yes, but not from Mama. 

 As a teenager, I wanted Mama to cuddle me and listen to my day, as she used to do when I was a baby. But I grew up and she didn't know how to deal with it. 

 Now, she's miles away, and she wants to give  money . Now, I have no idea what I want from her. 

 I don't think I want anything but her own peace of mind. 

 She was such a troubled and unhappy woman. I'd like to know that she's found some peace and happiness. 

 But I doubt it. Mama was always the type of woman whose emotions were to complicated for simple things like peace and joy. 

 Every time I accept the money she pushes on me I feel like I'm taking bits and pieces of her that should best be with  her . I don't know how to deal with this unwanted influx of generosity from Mama.

						    Someone told me that she couldn't see much difference between my old blog and my new blog in terms of content. 

 I still sound like me, apparently. 

 Well, hey, it's good to know I haven't been possessed by some strange alien so I no longer sound like me. 

 What can I say about the lack of content-difference? 

 Truthfully, I have no clue what I'm supposed to write about.  The Shrine  was about revealing as much of me as I could get away with.  This  blog is just a confusing muddle of day-to-day words. 

 Hey, look people! HANI's reduced to talking about what time she woke up, what she ate, and what she did today! 

 Except that I could never do such a thing if my life depended on it. 

 My brain's damaged. 

 The nearer to my finals it gets, the more my parents are telling me that I'm capable, intelligent and educated. I'll pass! I'll make it! 

 So why do I still keep feeling like I'm just totally, utterly, and completely screwed?

						    I ruined my skin-colour dress. 

 See I was refilling my Canon ink printer, while watching TV. Was not really paying attention to what was in my hands, and of course it overfilled, and dripped right onto my dress. 

 So now I have two random black-green faded spots on my dress. And they're not subtle.

						    I had tons of ideas for a post last night. 

 But last night, there was  urlLink Ash's birthday , and we partied till they kicked us out, so I got home really exhausted, and all the ideas in my head fled from the pain in my feet.... 

 Fun! Fun! Fun!  urlLink Ash ,  urlLink Meesh ,  urlLink Pick Yin ,  urlLink my boy  and me! We couldn't of course be ordinary clubbers, being bloggers, so Ash, T-boy and Pick Yin felt compelled to play some weird form of patty-cake right there in the middle of the bar/lounge/whatever-it-was. 

 We also did some Spin-the-Bottle. Amusingly enough to me, the people who spun the bottle didn't realize the significance of the bottle-spinning. Ash spun and got Pick Yin. Meesh spun and got Pick Yin. Pick Yin spun and got Pick Yin! T-boy spun twice and thankfully, both times, he got me! I spun and got nobody at all. So T-boy and I kissed twice, but Pick Yin refused to kiss anyone. Mwahaha! 

 It was such a simple evening, all in all. Yet it was so enjoyable. I wish such magic could always be repeated. Hmm, hey, who's birthday is next? Make that wish when blowing the candle, won't you?

 Getting somewhat tired of very very short hair. 

 Unfortunately, growing hair is an awkward process. Luckily my smile is so amazing that it makes my disreputable hair look cute. 

 Or maybe I should use the old deep cleavage trick so everyone's too busy looking at my boobs to look at my hair....

 Sometimes, I think my head is just filled with fluff. Or with the cotton I use to apply toner to my face or wipe off make-up remover.

 It's practically a miracle that I can form words at all.

						    Tariq and I have this tendency to have no clue what to do together. I mean, we have only so much money for food, coffee, and the usual entertainments. I've been banned from Tariq's house by his father. Tariq's allergic to my house. 

 So we've been trying out a few different things. A few days ago, we drove around looking at houses. Not bad, but since one of us has to keep an eye on the road, it wasn't something we could equally enjoy. 

 Today, we tried an evening stroll around a park. We only did one turn, amounting to half an hour, at a rather slow pace. I made Tariq carry my handbag. 

 For some reason, people were staring at us holding hands. Or maybe, like usual, they're staring at my boobs. Who knows why Malaysians stare? 

 Other than that, it was very fun. Lots to see. The park had many people to watch, but it was not as packed as a mall. There are trees and lakes and supposed waterfalls that weren't running. We stopped on the bridge to look at weird insects that Tariq says were treading the water. 

 At our slow pace, we had a lovely conversation, stress-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and stimulating, both physically and mentally. 

 In a world with so much entertainment and things to do, it's nice to realize that some of the most enjoyable things are still the simple things like walking through a park, holding hands with your best friend.

						    So I stayed up until 4:40 last night, studying. 

 So now I'm sleepy, sleepy. 

 Sleepy. 

 Oh and I'm suffering my first day of period. I always feel like my body is being corroded by acid and is about to fall apart into two pieces, on my first day of period. 

 So add that to sleepy. 

 Actually, I guess it's a blessing I'm sleepy then. Makes the pain not so bad, since I'm more desiring of sleep than for pain to stop....

						    I'm getting very irritated by how my blog looks right now. But I can't seem to get the focus and concentration to fix anything. That includes school stuff. 

 I'm just shuffling along, doing the absolute minimal that I can possibly get away with. 

 It irritates me. Well,  part  of me. 

 I'll be very glad when the semester is over. When it is, I think I shall kidnap Tariq's laptop, sit in Starbucks, and buy myself a non-stop flow of rhumba frappucino until my blog looks satisfactory. 

 Hmm, must save the money for such an expensive endeavour.

 But strangely, I'm not in the mood to be online anymore. 

 Hell, I have a report due tomorrow and I'm still reading silly novels today. I need to stop, but I don't  want  to stop. I want to say fuck everything! 

 I think next semester, if I pass this semester, I'll ask Mom to take me to another psychiatrist. Sigh. This is just too ridiculous for words.

						    That psycho problem with the phone has returned. 

 A long, long time ago, the phone went silent. As in, it had no dialtone. And when someone tried to call the house, we'd only hear the ringtone when we actually picked up the phone and listened into the handset. Which meant that even if we picked up the handset, the call could not actually be  answered . 

 We called Telekom and they  eventually  fixed it. This time round, it happened on the Friday evening of a  very  long weekend. We won't even be able to complain to Telekom until Wednesday. 

 Worse is that I really really really need the Internet. I have a report due next Monday, and I need to access my amazing and wonderful reference library online. 

 I think the world likes to make things as difficult as possible for me. Sigh.

						    Lately, I've become obsessed with  urlLink tarot . 

 I'm not sure why it fascinates me so. 

 Maybe it's because I'm very similar to a cat, and I've got a curiosity that will eventually kill me. 

 Maybe it's because I like connecting random pictures and symbols into a cohesive story. 

 Maybe it's because I want to help people, and this is a way that I'm quite good at it. 

 Maybe it's simply because I'm good at it, and I'm addicted to doing things that I imagine I'm good at. 

 There's just some kind of energy that tingles in me while I look at the cards that I've laid out. I love the comfort of shuffling. I love looking at the pictures. I love the stories involved with tarot. 

 I love giving advice to my friends and being actually listened to! 

 Sometimes. 

 I think they're starting to get bored of my tarot cards....

						    Finally HANI's Honey is revitalized and reborn! Welcome to my new site. 

 Was using Movable Type for a while, but if you look through the archives (yes, I already have archives), you'll see that I was not pleased with it. 

 There'll be plenty of changes to this blog. It's not fully up yet, but all the essential conditions of the contract are up, leaving only the unimportant warranties to be added (we just finished a Law Contract exam).... 

 It's the day after my first blog's birthday. I began blogging three years ago! 

 So I figured that this was the best time to pop back onto the blogosphere (phrase used specifically to annoy beloved boyfriend). 

 Enjoy, and please comment! I've missed all my readers very much! (Not the HANItrolls though. They found their way here even while blog was in trial stage!)

						    I hate that question. How was the Exam? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't. Do you think you'll pass? 

 No, I'll fail! I'll fail! 

 I wonder how people would react if I said  that . 

 You know what? I don't actually want to know. I don't want to know anything about my exams after my exams are done, because: 

 There is nothing more I can do about it. 

 If I pass, or if I fail, it's all out of my hands now. I submitted everything to the examiner. Why ask me  after  the exams, when I can do nothing anymore? 

 It's like poking someone all bound up immovable. You poke, and ask, "Can you move?" Poke. "How about your fingers?" Poke. "No? Wiggle your butt! You can wiggle your butt!" Poke. "Erm, maybe you can swing around instead." Poke. 

 Poke, poke, poke. 

 Look people, I'm bound as tightly possible and I CANNOT move. Poking me won't make me miraculously more mobile. Give up already. 

 Don't ask about the Exams.

						    Adik says she admires me because I have a "pure heart." When asked for an explanation she said she wasn't really able to describe it, but in attempting description, apparently, I have no spite, no envy, and I mean no harm to anyone at all. 

 She says Geza, her current boyfriend, also has that "pure heart." 

 In conclusion, I think what she means is that we judge people kindly. If people were glasses, we'd see them as half-full, rather than half-empty. 

 But I've often wondered whether I'm so admirable. I may have a pure heart, but I sure don't have a sensible brain. 

 Which is worse: hurting people on purpose, or by accident? I've always thought that when you hurt people on purpose, at least you're in control, and you can choose  not  to hurt people if you want to. 

 But if like me, you're oblivious, inconsiderate, and thoughtless, you tend to hurt people without even realizing it. And since you didn't do it deliberately, on purpose, it was not within your control, and you couldn't have stopped it. 

 So what's so admirable about a pure heart that's combined with a silly brain? 

 A little note: The title's inspired by law report titles (Volume 3, HANI's Honey Blog, page 1). My two exams next week are Law subjects.

						    There's something about heat, that saps the awakefulness of a person attempting to study. 

 I keep falling asleep over my textbooks. 

 Or maybe it's the serious amount of food I've eaten today. 

 Whatever it is, I'm really really sleepy. 

 Which is not good, because we're nearly entering the exam week. 

 And I'm not ready! I'm not ready! Argh!

						    Today, my little sister's white American boyfriend is driving my little Kancil car! 

 I wish I could have gone in the car with them, to watch the white boy drive his car. It should be hilarious! Especially since my Adik isn't reliable in her navigational skills. 

 But they haven't gone far. Only to the neighbourhood photo shop, and then to buy me my Burger King lunch. 

 But I'm really looking forward to hearing all about the Adventure of the White Boy & his Asian Girlfriend in the Really Small Car.

						    In studying, my biggest problem is that I feel totally and thoroughly intimidated by my textbooks. They're big and fat, and full of words. With no pictures. 

 I feel very intimidated when there are no pictures. 

 My marketing textbooks are pretty. They have  huge  text and  tons  of pictures. 

 But this semester, my exams are for Law (Contract) and Law (Marketing), and there are no pictures, and everything's in long, combobulated words printed in teeny weeny text-size. 

 And I look at 'em and I try to make pretty mind-maps. I try to motivate myself by drawing my mind-maps on pretty green paper, too! But there's so much information, that nothing fits onto my paper. I add and add and add, until there's no space. And the more notes I make, the more certain I feel that I know less than I started with. 

 Except that I've been through this before, and I  know  that studying works. 

 So why do I keep feeling intimidated by studying still?

						    After seven years of living in America, my sister arrived today to live at home. It is so good to have her home again. Adik's only fourteen months younger than I am, and we're closer to each other than to any other sibling. 

 Adik's been worrying about living in Malaysia. She recognizes that she's become quite Americanized and that there are many people who would disapprove of that. The values of Americans and the values of Malays tend to clash on many points. 

 While she was telling me all this, Tariq was receiving a lecture from his father about his non-Malay behaviour at his cousin's wedding tonight. 

 Each and everyone of us who returns home from a Western culture must find that balance between what our parents taught us and what we discovered on our own. There's a lot of bumbling around, embarrassment, and pain, while that balance is being sought. 

 While Adik is just about to go through it, and Tariq's right in the middle of it, I've already passed it. I've found my own little balance, and I never quite realized that I did, until tonight. 

 That's very silly of me, considering that I've been home for three years....

						    Too many people associate tarot with fortune telling. And since I read tarot, too many people think I tell fortunes. Too many people think I dabble in predicting the future. 

 Children, if I wanted to predict the future, I'd take more Analytical Marketing classes. 

 I don't use the tarot for fortune telling. I've tried it from time to time. I bet no one who has ever used the tools of fortune telling has avoided trying to tell the future. Personally, the results have always been shitty to me. Completely false. 

 So, since fortune telling is false for me, I don't use the tarot for fortune telling. So what the hell am I doing with all my tarot cards? 

 It's a focus tool for my mind. Let's use a loose metaphor. Think of my brain as the Internet. It's full of information that all sorts of people and computers put in it. But it's all jumbled up and disorganized, and really difficult to find specific information. 

 Someone comes along and needs information on something specific. Her relationship. His career. Her lack of purpose in life. The seeker already has the information. It's just in that confused jumble that is the brain. Just like the Internet. How do you find a specific website on relationships or career on the 'Net? You hit Google! 

 So I pull out the tarot cards. They're the Google of my brain. I "type in" the keyword, and I get relevant webpages in an organized sequence. Sometimes my Google tarot churns out irrelevant rubbish, but most times, Google does not fail me, and I find what I'm looking for. 

 Did that in any way make sense? 

 Maybe I need to pull out the tarot cards and Google my brain all over again. Do a search for "coherence."

						    Sometimes, I wonder why I don't give up. 

 Why do I smile, laugh, and jump around all chirpy-bimbo-style. over and over again? 

 What's the point? 

 Why do I keep up this routine? Why do I blog? Why do I go to college? Why do I date? Why do I even bother waking up? 

 Why do I bother trying to sleep? 

 I should just put on my best pair of sneakers and walk. Walk and walk and walk in a straight line until I collapse. 

 But the world is round, and sooner or later, I'd just be in yet another routine. 

 But just to have that temporary change, would be damned nice. To know that I managed to  break  a routine, to make a new one.

						    Today, Tariq taught me to play  urlLink Illuminati . He would be a pretty good strategist, I suppose, if he would stop succumbing to what he calls my puppy-dog look. 

 "Tariq, don't attack my Mafia. Then I won't have  any  income--I'm new to the game. You have to be nice to me, Tariq! Please, please, please!"

"Please, Tariq, let me have the Communists! You have so much income--you don't need the mere 6 megabucks! Pleeeeassse!" 

 You can't get the full effect without the look and the tone, really. Think Frank Herbert's  urlLink Bene Gesserit Voice . Mwahahaha! 

 Later, I made him waste about 50 megabucks interfering with my attempt to control some violent criminal communist group and then presented him with a special card that in effect said I'll win the group no matter what. 

 After that one, he cruelly hardened his heart against my entreaties. He declared his intention to destroy my largest source of income! So I pulled my last weapon and strategically became shocked by the time, and demanded that we immediately go to my college before it closes. 

 That way, though I don't win, I don't lose. I hate losing. Very heart-breaking. 

 And my boy is really quite brilliant, with the advantage of being more familiar with the game. A girl  has  to pull out all her artillery in such a situation! 

 Hmm, an Illuminati of women would make a lot of sense....

						    It's been four years since I first met Tariq. 

 The girl I am today is so different from the girl who first saw Tariq. 

 That girl was desperate for attention, a lot more manipulative, and more interested in collecting men by quantity than by quality. 

 The girl today is more content with herself, unmotivated to be manipulative, and more interested in settling down. 

 Yet the girl yesterday, and the girl today, have plenty in common. We're still picky about English grammar. We're still very fond of spending other people's money. We're still horrible at budgeting. 

 I could go on forever on how me-now and me-then are still alike. 

 But the truth is that four years affects a huge change on a person. Me-then didn't know the independence that being able to drive and having your own car gives you. Me-then didn't know what it was like to be committed in a long-distance relationship. Me-then didn't know what it was like to live by herself. Me-then didn't understand that my parents could never ever be disappointed in me. Me-then didn't believe that a man could really  know  me and still love me. 

 Me-now is very glad to be who I am today. 

 Now I wonder what the girl tomorrow is going to be like?

						    I think it's a possibility that I live in fear. 

 You'd think fear was a very definite emotion. You either feel afraid, or you don't. 

 But I'm beginning to suspect that fear is not that simple. 

 Fear can be something so constant, you don't even realize it's there. You've become inured to its presence. 

 Or perhaps, you're a master of denial, and you're lying to yourself so well, that you don't even recognize fear anymore. 

 Either way, fear is there, but you've been claiming it's anger, or hurt, or stress, or depression. You've been calling it everything under the sun but what it is. 

 I guess I'll have to admit it. I am  very  afraid. 

 I won't tell the reason I'm afraid, because I've explained these things in other terms before. I'm bored of my fears. 

 They constant and repetitive, and they never seem to change. 

 So I pushed them aside and pretended they were other things. 

 And everytime I didn't want to acknowledge my fears, I failed subjects, I picked fights with the boyfriend, or I abuse my body or my possessions in some manner. 

 It's time to stop pretending that I'm not afraid. 

 I am. I'm so very very very scared. 

 But now what?

						    It's been a month of holidays and soon, I'll be back in college. 

 I've been ignoring the Internet and the Internet activities of my friends for nearly a month, despite having plenty of time for it. 

 Now that I'm about to get busy again, I'm scrambling to catch up with what's going online. 

 I have often made this observation about myself: I like making things difficult for myself. 

 Despite knowing that there are things I  need  to do, I'm just feeling really, really lazy.... 

 I wanna go and watch  I, Robot  again. (Yes, I've watched it.) The best example of fanfiction ever. Hahaha!

						    Have been pondering a dream I had recently. Like most dreams, I don't remember  all  the details, but here's what I do recall: 

  At Which Point a Prince Desires Me  

 It began in the throne room of the  Agong , where I was sitting in an audience for the Agong's royal heir. I was dressed like a Malay princess, in yellow-and-gold  songket baju kebaya  and  sanggul  holding up&nbsp;my hair. I sat on my heels as I watched traditionally dressed men run through the formal greeting (" Ampun Tuanku beribu-ribu ampun !") and go slightly further. The men started doing some kind of  joget  hand moves while kowtowing to the prince. 

 I was feeling amazed by how the men were willing to strain their necks and backs to suck up to the stupid royalty when the prince caught my eyes and I couldn't resist them. They kept looking at me throughout the royal audience. He was dressed as a traditional prince should be, complete with  keris , and he had compelling, arresting eyes that bore right into my heart. I kept trying to look away, but my eyes always returned to his. 

  Exposition that the Prince Always Gets What He Wants  

 Suddenly the audience was over and with his compelling eyes, the prince drew me&nbsp;into his private chambers. It was actually a sitting room, and he had friends in there. The Agong was Kelantanese and the prince's friends kept interrupting him with Kelantanese interjections which the Prince was obliged to reply in the Kelantanese dialect. 

 His Highness looked me over, and as he held my chin, he explained that I was very tempting, and he always got any woman he wanted, but he had made a bet with a mutual friend of ours, named Jack, that he would lay off seducing women into his bed for a week or so. As&nbsp;the prince&nbsp;considered aloud whether to forfeit his bet with Jack to have me, I held my breath, because I knew I couldn't resist him, but in the dream, I was a good, traditional girl and I didn't want to give up my virtue. 

  In Which the Reason I'm a Transvestite Remains a Mystery  

 In the end he decided to mull it over, and sent me home. My "home" looked like one of those tourist shops at Kuching's waterfront, selling tourist t-shirts and  batik  sewed up into weird free-size pieces of clothing. When I told my family (consisting of a father and two older sisters) about the Prince's interest in me, they all panicked, because I'm actually a male who'd been raised to dress up like a woman. 

 In the dream, I knew the reason I had to pretend I was a female, but when I woke up later, I realized that the dream had not revealed this reason. However, it was apparently a very compelling reason that would keep me in drag for all of my life. 

 My family in the dream did not at all resemble my actual family. My "father" was a portly dark-skinned Chinese man whose head was bald in a wide strip from forehead to the nape of his neck. My sisters looked like Disney princesses, but were as opinionated as  Mean Girls . 

  At Which Dates Include  Sound of Music  and a Kryptonian Battle Suit  

 No one told of my true gender to the Prince, for fear of his anger, and he came to court me. The first date, he took me up to the hills and sang  Sound of Music  to me. The second date, he got seven children to sing  Sound of Music  to me on the same hills. I liked him and would have enjoyed the dates if I wasn't so worried that he would attempt to remove my clothes and discover my penis. I was terrifed of his reaction to such a revelation. 

 Suddenly, there was a battle in a valley among the hills. The Agong's assault team was surrounded by some terrorists in a stalemate and the Captain called for the Prince to save the team. So the Prince excused himself, and in a Kryptonian battle suit, went to beat the crap out of the terrorists. 

  In Which an Attempt to Dress Me as a Male was Made  

 I went home and told my father that I needed men's shoes to date the Prince, as he kept insisting on dragging me through the outdoors, which was hell on my&nbsp;high heel shoes. My father was glad, and decided this was an excellent time to finally dress me as a man. However I had never ever dressed as a man in my entire life (yes, even in the dream where I'm a male) and I felt frightened. Nonetheless, I was a dutiful daughter and wanted to please my father. 

 We went to the back of the shop where my father's assistant gave me men's pants to wear. I spent a few minutes being fascinated by the pants, as I had never worn pants in my life (in the dream). Then the assistant gave me one of those Vietnamese tops to put on over the pants. My father was displeased by the Vietnamese top because he wanted me to dress as a man, but the assistant insisted that I was meant to dress as a woman, and while he was willing to compromise and put me in pants, there was no way he would be a party to giving me male clothes. My sisters agreed with the assistant. 

 My father tried to score some points by saying that the Vietnamese top could be considered a male Vietnamese top, since the top was worn by men too, but the assistant said there was no way that the Vietnamese top was considered male clothes, because of the Cheongsam style buttons. My father then suggested cutting them off would solve the problem, but the assistant insisted that that would be pointless because of all the embroidery on the top proclaimed me a female. 

  In Which I had a Depressing Realization that Concluded the Dream  

 After all this debate by the people around me, in which I stayed silent and increasingly distressed by the fact that I had to  live  such a lie, my father conceded defeat. On my way to the mall, I stopped by the Palace to visit the Prince and show of my new clothing, hoping that the significance of male pants and male shoes would hint to him of my true gender. I wanted him to know the truth, but I didn't want to tell him. 

 As I faced him in his living room, I realized that I couldn't tell him, because I didn't want him to stop desiring me, as I desired him. In the dream, I became distressed at the idea that I could never get married with a man and have kids. 

 There, I woke up. Throughout the whole dream, I was pretty much very passive, and didn't speak. Any moments when I spoke was actually "jumped," as if a movie had been censored. 

 There're so many tantalizing details in this dream, but I can't figure out the significance of it at all. So I've been pondering it at any quiet moment.

						    Naughty girl! Naughty girl! Oooh, HANI is such a naughty girl! 
&nbsp;
 I haven't touched my computer  at all . Not since my last post. 
&nbsp;
 I didn't check my e-mails, I didn't check blogs, I didn't IM anyone, and I wasn't even invisible! 
&nbsp;
 I was, quite simply, internet-free for the past month. 
&nbsp;
 I wouldn't have been online today either, except that exam results are out and I had to go check 'em online. I got one Distinction, one Credit, one Pass, and one Fail! Actually, the Fail was a Did Not Attempt (because I didn't submit projects, as usual), but it counts as a Fail, nonetheless. 
&nbsp;
 So what did I do while I was away from my computer? 
&nbsp;
 I went on a three-day trip to Sarawak with Adik and two of her Princeton collegemates, I re-read Harry Potter (books 1 to 4), hung out with my boyfriend's little sister, had my hair cut into a new hairstyle, and acted as my little sister's driver. My sister now owns one of the twenty-six purple Gen-2s on the road!! (Yes, only 26 purple Gen-2s have been purchased.)&nbsp;But since Adik doesn't know how to drive, I get to drive it! Mwahaha! 
&nbsp;
 Next week, I will begin hounding the college for registration forms and booklists, and I will hound Mom for money and guarantee letters (her company is still paying for my medical necessities, as I'm still a student). Adik is pestering me to go to the Ear, Nose, &amp; Throat specialist, to the Eye Specialist, to the Dentist, and to the Gynecologist and I'm praying she stops at that, and no other doctors. That girl is obsessed with medicine and she takes it out on me!

						    I'm getting really, really lazy in expressing myself. 

 I think in the olden days, I desperately expressed myself because I felt invisible and ignored by family. 

 Of course I've learnt since then that it was all a delusion in my overdramatic, teenage-like, late-blooming head. 

 So now, being heard and understood doesn't seem so important anymore. 

 I mean, is it really so important for a bunch of online people to understand me? Hell, I can't seem to remember why it's important for  friends and family  to understand me. 

 What's the problem of people looking at me like I'm the weirdest thing on earth? What's the problem if they don't even see me? 

 No problem at all. 

 I used to spend so much energy trying to push my thoughts and feelings externally, to a place where they can be heard, acknowledged, and be responded to. Today, it feels as if pushing my opinions is just a tiring activity. It's work that takes effort I'm not willing to expend. 

 If you hear me and you understand me, I'm very pleased. I just don't want to take a lot of effort to help you hear and understand. It's not my priority anymore. 

 I've learnt that there are more important things in life than being heard and being understood. And trust me, after three years of blogging, they never understand you anyway.

						    After the  third  time in my life that this discussion came up, I must now state it on my blog. 

 Condoms should be used  with lubricant . 

 I can't believe that three  separate  women have told me that they don't like using condoms because they're "uncomfortable." 

 If  men  told me that, I'd believe them. But if women say that, that means the condom is being   in correctly  used! 

 Use common sense, damn it! Condoms are rubber! The natural secretions of the human vagina is not sufficient lubrication! 

 Walk into Guardian and pay a little extra for  lubricated  condoms. If you're cheap, a tube of Ansell Personal Lubricant costs less than eight  ringgit  and goes down to  six ringgit  during the Malaysian Mega Sale! (They're right beside the condoms). That will get you  months  of  daily  use. 

 And if you're "too shy" or "too embarrassed" to buy condoms,  you don't deserve to have sex . 

 My tip: pretend you're married. I know a few married couples who use condoms because the wife doesn't want to mess with her natural reproductive system. 

 It's things like this that make me so pissed off with people who disagree with sex education. Everyone  needs  to know how to use a condom  properly .
