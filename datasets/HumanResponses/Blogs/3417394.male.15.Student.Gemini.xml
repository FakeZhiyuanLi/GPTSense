       2 hours until summer break!! I just got done with my Computer Final so I'm gunna write something. The printer is so damn slow so I'd be able to write a freaky book here before the paper came out. My birthday is tomorrow! I think my mom is gunna take me to a movie. Well i don't know what else to type and i don't wanna get caught on here.

       After my health final this kid said,"Dude, I heard you were Bi is that true...That's what everyone is saying." I can't stand people. Sometimes people don't know why I get mad about being called a fag but it's because I can count on hearing it every day. Sometimes I purposely take different routes to class or sit in different spot when I can. Tomorrow is the last day of school and I might actually not have to worry about other people.

       Hey, I just got back from prison. The prison cleverly named " urlLink  school  ." Today I got pissed off because of this girl I can't stand!! Anyway I can't wait for my B-day. This girl who I talk to a lot (Lacie) is convinced that my b-day on the 26th when in fact it is the 28th. Oh well. I expect presents from all! What sucks more than finals? Nothing. I should probably study. I can't wait  for my  urlLink order  to come in! Who cares? I do now i can use my camera for webcaming without draining the battery in 30 seconds!!! Anyway the party mess is cleaned up and one psycho neighbor sent me home with a bag of trash that got in his yard. I should of told him to go to hell! Oh and if anyone knows why people are moody (and dramatic) lately please comment!!

       Today I went to Relay for Live with my mom and met up with Chaley. Her and I walked back to her house because we were gunna swim. Chaley's boyfriend doesn't want her talking to boys and most of all me. So she was a little worried. But we were swimming for awhile when the dog started barking and Chaley's boyfriend can out the back door. I couldn;t do anything but laugh I thought it was really funny but apparently not her boyfriend. So though it'd be best to change and leave so I did.
