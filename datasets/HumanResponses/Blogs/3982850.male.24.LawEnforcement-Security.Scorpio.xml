      OH MY GOD!!!!  Heee heee heee heeeee *girly hysterical giggling*  *regains composure*  Ok, this is a FANTASTIC Batman fan film I've just found :-  http://theforce.net/theater/nonsw/grayson/  It's a little out of continuity and the basic premise is that in 20 years, Batman has been murdered, and DIck Grayson (the very first Robin), comes out of 'retirement' to become Robin once again and avenge his mentors death. And very good it is too! It's in the form of an extended trailer and is WELL worth the download. I won't spoil any of it and your comments on it are always welcome. Even if you aren't a girly,giggling fan boy like me, it's still worth a watch! :)  It's called 'Grayson' and by Untamed Cinema http://www.untamedcinema.com/      While I'm at it (and I've just found more...Hee heee heee *AHEM*), here's a link to Dead End. A Batman fan film by Sandy Corolla. http://www.collorastudios.com/  This starts off as Batman VS Joker...But has a few twists along the way! This is also fantastic, and better than the last 2 Batman films. Most definitely better than Catwoman too (which will be utter drivel and I refuse to ever watch it)  http://www.theforce.net/theater/nonsw/batman_deadend/index.shtml  Again, Definitely worth a download. :)

      Badoowmmmmm! The scanks next door are at it again.... *THUMP* *BANG* *SLAM* THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP*. I've definitely added them to my ' LIST'  - Y'know, like really important people like...Ben Afleck have...Where they remember everyone who ever pissed them off - and kill them at a later date. Bwahahaah! I'll leave it 40 years and when I'm dying of ass cancer, and not only can't I fart anymore, but I won't be able to live anymore - I'll track them down and murder them :)&nbsp;

      I really like art. I dont mean just any old crap - like anything that gets the 'coveted' Turner prize - I mean good art. It doesn't need to be techincally perfect, or be exactly right - just have that factor that appeals to you so much that you wish it was hung on your wall, and you that you could tell people that YOU produced it. I especially love seeing a picture of one of my comic heroes that instantly evokes the sensation of their essence in yourself - not just with well known characters as such - just any picture you see that speaks to you. Or stuff that just makes you go 'wow!' ;)  &nbsp; Anyways, I've been looking for some decent fan art today and found some fantastic stuff. &nbsp; First off :- &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.deviantart.com  &nbsp; Not just fan art - but photography, poetry etc - Can take some time to trawl through all the stuff you aren't interested in - but still good excellent all the same! I didnt keep the links to my fave stuff (which was a bit silly lol) &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.cgtalk.com &nbsp;I found some ace stuff here - a serious amount of wowness! :P &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.popcultureshock.com/timm/ &nbsp;Bruce Timm is one of my fave comic artists - along with Jim Lee, Neal Adams, Michael Turner, Shane Gline, Michael Avon Oeming...Stopping now lol. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
