       Yes, be amazed, I actually am writing about something that does not have anything to do with a book.      My family, and Jason my boy friend, went out to a baseball game last night. Angels vs. Tigers. We lost...again. *sigh* I went to two back to back games against two different teams and the Angels lost both times. Oh well, they're only a game and a half out of the wildcard race so I'm not too worried but still...I like it when the halo is lighted as we leave. It was a close game too, except they kept Lackey in too long and he gave up three runs...ugh. Terrible. Then even Perci didn't do his job last night...he gave up the final two runs...and he's our closer...eh, whatever. I still love the Angels and I'm not going to let go now just because of two measley losses. I bet they do better soon.      It was really fun last night because there were fireworks afterward, and it's always fun spending time with Jason.       I haven't told you about Jason before. We met almost two years ago and we've been dating for fourteen months now. He's absolutely the love of my life. We've talked about marriage but we're not going to get married until we're both older (I'm 17, he's 20) and through with college. I know that some people will always say things like "How can you know that he's the one if you're only 17?" And I thought so too. I was really unconvinced that I could fall in love with someone at 16 (which is when I told him I loved him) but I just knew that I did. It is something you just know. It always annoyed me when people said that but now I totally understand. They tell you that because it's the truth. I've had crushes on other guys and I thought that it was love once but compared to what I have now, it wasn't much.       Anyway, I just wanted to drop in and give you a hello again.      All I want is one comment :-p      ~Katrina

       Not sure why I wanted that as a title but I figured, what the heck, I might as well. It was  a spur of the moment thing and I like it.      Well, I spent the whole morning reading books. Today I read   Ella Enchanted   for the second time. I hadn't remembered much about it except for basic details. I really love that book. I haven't seen the movie but I feel a little uninterested by it. I read the description and it's totally different from the book. It makes me really angry. I mean, I know that I shouldn't be surprised by it. Most movies from books aren't similar. But it does disappoint me. I mean, suddenly the prince has an evil uncle who wants to take over the kingdom...the only thing similar between the two is the fact that her name is Ella and that she's cursed! *sighs* but then I realized, there was no hope for the movie from the beginning...it's a Disney movie. Not that I don't like Disney Movies...I do. But they are never close to the original stories. Well, I won't be totally closed minded about it. I will rent it and see how it is. I'm sure it's a cute movie.      So, I'm sort of lost about this whole blog thing. I still don't know how you get people to view it? Do they come by themselves or what? *grumbles* no one is interested in all my book grumbling! Eh, oh well...      My parents still haven't started reading me story to start editing it...ugh. Hello?! They made this rule that I couldn't publish it until they had finished editing it. Mom got mad because she was rushed last time. Well! I gave her time now! Hello?! Where is even one mark on the pages? Has she even taken a look at it? Has she even read the title? I don't think so. I don't really blame Dad. I mean...he's dealing with trying to find a job and that's been stressful for him. And I know Mom's work is hard, but couldn't she read like a page a day at least? That can't be that hard.      We're going on a cruise next week and she   promised   that she would start reading it but you know what? I bet they forget to take it? I just want someone, anyone to read it and tell me how it is. I worked   SO   hard on this and now it's just like...I can't get the final peice finished. *groans* this is so impossible.      Whatever, no one wants to hear me complain. Lol. That's about it in book news for today. If I   ever   get this stupid book released, I'll tell you.      Thanks guys! Bye!      ~Katrina

        Well hello there. I just wanted to drop by and leave another note. It'll be much shorter this time. I just wanted to write something because I was bored lol. I hope this color isn't too blaring. I'm starting to get used to this blog thing, even though I'm not quite sure how people find them because I've only seen about ten of them total...how do I get to other people's blogs? If someone actually reads this and can help then I'd be very greatful!      Anyway, thanx guys. That's all I wanted to say. Bye guys!      ~Katrina

        Hello there, this will be my first blog ever...is that what this is called or is the blog the entire site? Eh, oh well. I was kind of sick of waiting for Bolt.com to get their journals back up so now I showed them didn't I? I'm not bolt dependent anymore. I'm sure you're all glad to hear that :-p.       Anyway, my life has been pretty good right now. I finished the sequel to my story and I decided to title it,   Catarina's Return: The Battle for the Dark Stones  . Pretty good if I do say so myself. Does it make you want to read it? I certainly hope so. However, it is a sequel...and the first one still hasn't been published seperately darn it. That's my next authorian project, to finish editing   Catarina's Quest  .      By the way, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, go ahead and take a look at my website. Really, its my dad's website because he runs it but the books are all there. Or if it's too complicated for you, go to  urlLink http://www.bn.com  and search for   A Journey Into Imagination: The Adventure Begins  . That's the name of the book that my dad and I wrote together. He wrote three really awesome stories, I wrote two. Mine, I'm proud to say, was the longest in the whole book, around 170 pages I think.      Well, I'm not sure what else to say. Maybe I'll leave another entry here sometime later today. I don't really have much to say except hello, and I hope that someone somwhere reads this stupid thing because if I'm just sitting here talking to myself then I feel like a real idiot. ;-) Please someone leave a comment so that I know I'm not all alone in this world!      Oh, and before I go, did you know that J. K. Rowling, author of   Harry Potter   if you don't know, is going to have another baby? I personally hope it's a girl. I really wish she would name one of her kids after a   Harry Potter   character...but something tells me she isn't going to fulfill my wishes. Oh darn. Ok, tis all. Bye now.      ~Katrina
