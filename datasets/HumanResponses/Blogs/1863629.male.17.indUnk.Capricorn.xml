      Alright, I've finally given in.  I'm writing out a Blog, and hopefully I'll stick with it for awhile. We'll see how it goes.  First off, let me say that this is not going to be a day to day journal of my life.  That would bore you to tears.  No, this will be a little more universal than that.  I want to use this to help me think, help me clear the clutter from my mind.  And maybe, just maybe, something I type will help someone who reads it.  But that would just be a fortunate side-effect.  B, this is not by any means perfect writing, and I am well aware of that.  Constructive criticism is much appreciated, but there's no need to scan my entries for grammatical errors.  Honestly, you don't want to waste your time doing that, and I don't want to hear about it if you do.  Finally, I'll try to update this thing bi-weekly, but that's flexible.  If you have anything you'd like to see written, drop a line, IM me, or something of the sort.  I suppose that will be all for this entry.  I'll get around to posting another in the near future.

      After that mess, I need something more upbeat, more uplifting; something that can always brighten the mood.  Music.  Music is and probably always will be one of the most important aspects of my life.  I can go to music of nearly any fashion for nearly any event.  Rough day, music; great day, music; bored, music; you get the idea.  A song can inspire such a change in emotion, I'm always amazed.    Yet some people don't seem to realize that it's not the words, its the feelings the song as a whole creates.  As a quote I keep around in my profile puts it, "Where words fail, music speaks," and this has always held true for me.  A song can recreate an emotion, provide sympathy, and let you know that others have felt the way you do now.  It's comforting, relaxing, and simply an amazing art.  **By the way, check out my song of the day (or so) in my profile, especially if you've never heard of the song/artist before.  It's always an good to broaden you're horizons.  If you've found a song/artist you think I or anyone else would be into, let us know.  New music is always good**

      I feel some need to post, though I have little to talk about.  I wanted my first real post to have some meaning, some deep emotion to it, but I suppose I'll settle with this.   I think too much.  Simple as that.  I overanalyze the simple, try to make things complicated in my mind, and put a lot of needless stress over my head.  I try to rationalize everything, turn it all into yes's or no's, 1's or 0's, and in doing so, I miss the point on almost everything concerning love.  In relationships, I have always blamed myself for every mistake; I've always placed the people I love on pedestals, perfect in my eye; I've done everything wrong for I've no idea what's right.  I've been afraid to talk, for I might say something dumb.  I've hoped for the world, yet not wanted to work for it.  I've tried to turn love into a rational thing, while it's the furthest thing from rational.  Damn, I'm ridiculously critical of myself, but that's a load off my chest.  View this sporadic mess not as organized writing, for that it is not, but rather I look into the mind of one Jeff K.  I'm glad to have cleaned out that garbage, and feel free to leave your opinions.

       Ah yea...   I'm definitely happy today, the happiest I've been in quite a while mind you.  For those of you who haven't heard, I made it.  I'm in the GT Mentorship program for 2004-2005.  And today, for the first time in a while, I feel truly blessed.  Everything seems to be clicking into place.  It's as though all the work I've put in is finally yielding a reward better than a mere grade point.  I'm going to be able to work along side a true Robotics (hopefully NASA)  Engineer, and actually help with the research and design.  To say that I'm thrilled would be an understatement.  Also, throughout this whole ordeal, I realized how unbelievably great my friends are.  Everyone I talked to was behind me one-hundred percent, even if it meant quitting band.  I really think that it's because of you, and all the confidence you gave me, that I made it.  I doubt I could have pulled this off with out all of you.  And for those of you in band, fret not.  'Siak and I are trying to make a deal.  There's little hope for marching, but I might be able to pull of concert season.  We'll see how that works out.  And if it doesn't work, I'm still coming to every game I can, every concert, and every performance I can make.  I, as others have stated, love music and love making it, and I don't want to quit, but if I get overwhelmed with everything, I'll have to.  Now, if I can survive it, next year will be an unreal experience.  I can't wait.

       Ah shit...   I did it, unfortunately.  As I told Matysiak I had to miss part of tomorrow's rehearsal for an interview, he, being curious, asked what for.  I, being a dumbass, said GT Mentorship program.     urlLink       He's not as dense as we all once thought.  He knows of the program, and bluntly responded, "You're asking me to miss rehearsal so that you won't take band next year."  I've got nothing on that.  I expected some resistence, but not outright assholery.  He went on to say, "You'll get in, don't worry, they're glad to take anyone." Before, he just caught me off-guard; now he made a blatant attack on a organization he knows nothing about.  I may be a dumbass, but he's an   urlLink       Before, I was going to make an honest effort to make peace with Matysiak and leave on good terms, but now I find he isn't going to play ball.  If he's going to be harsh and rude to me, I'll do it back.  I'm tired of his crap, and now I hope more than ever that I'll make the cut for mentorship.  I'm just sick of the directors in general... I want out.  ** If the pictures above do not show, click on them.

      Alright, though this was quasi-nice while it lasted, I'm probably not going to update this for a long time.  There is so much I would love to write about right now, but most of it needs to be kept to myself.  This medium is so limiting - I feel as if most people shouldn't see what I'm writing about and I can't write about anything to personal for a fear that it will be misunderstood.  So I'm switching to a journal of some sort.  Or not, I'm not really sure.  I haven't really felt any great release from writing this mess, so I don't know if a journal would really do the trick.  Anyway, you need not check this blog for quite a while.  Until I have a change of heart, I bid you farewell.

      The Under-toad is strong.  I have this sense that all the good things that are going on in my life could be swept out from under me in an instant, and it's, to put it lightly, quite bothersome.  A commercial on the radio said I suffer from "Deficient Checking Syndrome"... something tells me thats not quite it though.  I just have this sinking feeling that all the stuff I've worked for could be gone in an instant, and all the work I've put in lost.  Maybe I worry too much.  I know I should just chill out and enjoy it, but part of me can't relax.  Anywho, I'm ready to branch out and start something new.  Anything new, really.  I need some excitement and such in my life.  If anyone would care to join me, I'm thinking of taking up rock climbing at the Texas Rock Gym (it's about a 20 minute drive from here).  It's a little expensive to get started, but I think it would be an awesome experience.  Just ask me about it or check out  urlLink Texas Rock Gym .   That'll be all for tonight.

       Song of the day:   Let me take you down, ’cause I’m going to strawberry fields. Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout. Strawberry fields forever.  Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see. It’s getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn’t matter much to me. Let me take you down, ’cause I’m going to strawberry fields. Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout. Strawberry fields forever.  No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low. That is you can’t you know tune in but it’s all right, that is I think it’s not too bad. Let me take you down, ’cause I’m going to strawberry fields. Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout. Strawberry fields forever.  Always, no sometimes, think it’s me, but you know I know when it’s a dream. I think I know I mean a ’yes’ but it’s all wrong, that is I think I disagree. Let me take you down, ’cause I’m going to strawberry fields. Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout. Strawberry fields forever. Strawberry fields forever.   ~The Beatles

      On another, completely seperate note, I'm definitely getting  urlLink this shirt .  For those of you who haven't heard my almost constant coughing this past week, I've got asthma, and what shirt could be better to show-off both my disease of choice and my love for the hip-hop industry?  There is none - how can I pass up such a wonderful shirt?  Hopefully it'll be ordered this weekend and worn by the end of next week.  It's off da heezy, fo sheezy!

       Ah Office Space   As I watched one of my favorite movies today, the question arose "What would you do if you had a million dollars?"  Personally, I would do as many things as I'd have time to.  I'd attempt to write music, design some complicated (and probably pointless) machine, rebuild an old car, read to my hearts content, and who knows what else.  I'd want to do anything relating to design - be it a melody or machinery.  And, as sad as it sounds, I get a massive rush and sense of accomplishment from creating something from nothing.  I'd do something "Junkyard Wars"-esque; build something somewhat eyecatching yet useless.  All and all, I'd have to design and construct.  So, to you, the reader, I pose the same question - what would you do if you had a million dollars?

      Random Fact of the day:  Not only does helium raise the pitch of ones voice when inhaled, but also the pitch of a wind instrument goes over a half step sharp.  Proven today by my brother, my sister's month old birthday balloons, and me.  In other news, Megan should not post such unflattering pictures as the "cover" of her online album.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's better that way.  Fortunately the next photo isn't half as disturbing... I really don't know what was going on in that first one.  Stars' show was amazing.  I'm still trying to decide whether I liked Linda's or Meg's dancing better... it's a close call.  Question to the readers - me as a stud next year - yea or neh?  I know I may not seem like the dancing type, but you all know you want to see me make an ass of myself trying.  Flutes - we almost got a II in sightreading because of you!  Learn to play in the key or else, and Melissa, your tuning is horrendous.  I'm going to tell Mr. Matysiak all about you and your plotting against band.  This is a state year, darn it, and we can't have section leaders not pulling their weight.  And you don't need to go to your lessons, you can do that on your own time.  Why can't you be a spineless sheep like your supposed to?  On a serious note, I'm not feeling very serious, so I'll just call it an entry here.

       urlLink   Find Out If You Are John Stamos!    These quizes at so much meaning to my life.  I can really find out who I am and what I stand for by the vegetable that represents me, the instrument that suits my personality, and the high school stereotype that fits me to a 't'.  And they always seem to describe exactly what I'm going through.  For instance, I was told that there is "more to me than meets the eye" and that I'm "a fun loving person"!  Thats so true, and so few people know that about me, but this quiz got it right within 2 minutes.  Here's what one guy said on that awesome Emode.com website:  "I could NOT believe that the results of my personality test were, "Mark, you're a rock star". I've been writing songs on my guitar my entire life. How did you know?!" — Mark, Boston, MA  It's true! I bet his songs are really emotional too, about depression and how he isn't satisfied with his life.  And I know that feeling too - that kind of music is right on with what I'm thinking, and he just comes out and says it.  I bet he's really talented, and he's going to make it big - look out for Mark!  Well, this fun loving person is going to go to bed.  There's so much more I'd love to say, but I guess I'll just save it for another time.

      Here it is.  It's not too bad for a late night paper. Enjoy.      Through my times in high school thus far, I’ve come to the obvious conclusion that I, Jeff Kammerman, am a stress addict.  It’s really not a chosen habit, but rather one, it seems, I can never avoid.  Through a twisted, disturbing combination of perfectionism and procrastination, I manage to turn seemingly simple assignments into the Ironman Triathlon.  A worksheet, put off until the period before it is due, suddenly becomes a frenzy of desperate writing, yet I can’t do a mediocre job of it.  Every answer must be checked, every ‘t’ crossed and ‘i’ dotted as the clock ticks down to the last seconds.  Finally, the last question is answered as the bell rings, and I can breathe.      Now, you may be asking yourselves, “Why on Earth does he care that much about a worksheet?” and in truth, I usually don’t.  I’m too relaxed, laidback, some would go as far as lazy, to let a minor assignment worry me to that point.  But, ironically, it’s never the minor ones I put off.   It seems to be the journals, the papers, and the projects always become night before endeavors.  I’d like to clear something up though – it’s not only in English class that I procrastinate, just usually.  And that is not because I don’t care about this class by any means; rather, it’s because I do care.  Procrastination is a strange, strange disease that, in my dealings with it, causes a person to reverse his priority list.  All pressing tasks are put on hold for things that don’t really need to be done.  For example, before I began the essay you are presently listening to/reading, I finished a Computer Science project, practiced my horn, enjoyed the company of my friends, and took my dog on a long walk.  If I hadn’t had been procrastinating a major essay, that would seem to be a fairly productive day.  But of course, that would be too good to be true.  I had only delayed the inevitable, and in the back of my mind while I pretended to be industrious, I knew my time was ticking down.       I wish I could explain to you why I procrastinate, why I bring all this stress upon myself, but I honestly can’t tell you.  Instead, I’ll share with you the time-tested excuses that have served this purpose long before I began procrastinating.    The most popular of these is the ever famous “I work better under pressure.”  We’ve all heard it, and I’m sure some of you have used it yourself.  However, this excuse is just that, an excuse.  I know I would do a much better job of something if I began it weeks in advance, checked it, edited it, and added the final touches for its presentation to the public (or just Ms. Liscum).  But, if I start it the day of and work late into the night, my sense of judgment is a tad bit impaired.  I’ll think an essay that’s not (to put it colloquially) a piece of crap, is A+ material.  It is seemingly my finest piece yet, and I did it under a time constraint of a day.  I guess I do work better under pressure.     Also, I’ve been fond of the “I’m afraid I’ll do a bad job” excuse.  This logic just doesn’t add up.  I’m worried that I’ll do badly; therefore I’m not going to do it until as late as possible.  This way, I’ll have a good excuse if it’s a mess.  “That paper, goodness, I threw that together at 10 o’clock last night.”  It’s as though a person’s procrastination gives him/her the right to do a horrible job.       The worst part of these excuses is that they’re usually not told to other people – they are saved for myself.  I use these justifications to let my lazy side convince me I can put it off.  Major essays, journals, Region Band audition music, and even simple worksheets are put off as long as possible, because after all, I work better under pressure.  I should know better by now, but it seems I’ll never learn.

      Reflexive Essay on how procrastination has affected my life - started at 2 in the afternoon, the day before it is due.  In the event that it's not horrible, I just might post it for all to view, critique, and cherish.  You just might gain a more insightful perspective into the mind of Jeff (the odds are slim).  (Sorry for those expecting a real entry and found this tease.  Fret not, something is on it's way.)

       A Sign?   6/2/04 - My air conditioning went out.  It reached a pleasant 89 degrees in my house, and hovered around there for most the day.  6/3/04 - My cable/internet was down.  Way to much of my entertainment comes from those two sources.   I think someone's telling me to go outside more often.

       My Brother Won   Yesterday, as my brother and I were wandering around Schliterbahn in search of the rest of our family, we had this pleasant conversation:  K: Where are we? J: Here. K: Then where are we going? J: There. K: Where are we now? J: We're here. K: No, we're there. J: No, here is there, and there is now here. K: That's neither here nor there. J: Damn, I've got nothing on that.   Lessons Learned:   &#9688; My brother is a Bio wiz.   &#9688; Getting airborne on the water slides does not necessarily make you faster.   &#9688; Three kids in the back of an Impala isn't nearly as comfortable as three kids in the back of a Suburban.   &#9688; Not everything fun must be planned out; aka Spontaneity can be grand.   &#9688; Eye contact can do amazing things.   &#9688; When jumping to grab the wall in a wave pool, make sure small children are not behind you.   &#9688; The park opens at 10, not 9. (Thanks Dad, who needs sleep anyway)   &#9688; On the Cliffhanger tube ride, the  right , not the left path, leads to the river.   &#9688; The Boogiebahn (Fake wave to boogie board on) is more fun when you know what you're doing.       I however, did not.  I could go on, but I think they're getting worse and worse... I'll stop while I'm not too far behind.

      Hey, Jeff bought a CD:  urlLink I Should Coco - Supergrass     It's a rather brit-pop-punk album with a dash of psychodellica mixed in and a whole lot of energy.  And for your enjoyment (perhaps), Track number 4 -  urlLink Alright , and it's lyrics.  We are young, we run green, Keep our teeth, nice and clean,  See our friends, see the sights,  Feel alright   We wake up, we go out,  Smoke a fag, put it out,  See our friends, see the sights, Feel alright   Are we like you? I can't be sure, Of the scene, as she turns, We are strange in our worlds  But we are young,  we get by, Can't go mad,  ain't got time,  Sleep around, if we like, But we're alright  Got some cash, bought some wheels, Took it out, 'cross the fields, Lost control, hit a wall, But we're alright  Are we like you, I can't be sure, Of the scene, as she turns, We are strange in our worlds  But we are young, we run green, Keep our teeth, nice and clean, See our friends, see the sights, Feel alright  Are we like you, I can't be sure, Of the scene, as she turns, We are strange in our world  But we are young, we run green, Keep our teeth, nice and clean, See our friends, see the sights,  Feel alright.   Feel alright!

      One heck of a Father's day/birthday gift:     Oh yeah, we got it.   In other news, Clements band rocked the Region.  Due to some fluke (or perhaps talent we didn't realize we had) Clements got first in Region 17.  Check out the  urlLink website  if you're doubtful, but it's true.  Area judging begins June 19, so we'll have to wait and see on that.

      Sunburns suck.  I had to pass up a chance to go back to Galveston for another day because of my damn sunburn and my parents good sense.  And I, perhaps foolishly, wanted to go again to spend the day with a couple of cool kids.  Also, I managed to sunburn my lips as I found today during a not-so-hot practice time.  Response ↓, Suckiness ↑.     Boredom sucks.  We need to find more random fun stuff, be it playing video games or ultimate, hide and seek or marco polo.   That is all.

       So Much To Say   I suppose I should catch you readers up on the ongoing events of my life, or something to that effect.  Summer school's in full swing, and I'm incredibly glad I took it.  Rather than waste a whole semester and likely be required to do worksheets, take quizzes, etc, I'm getting it over with in 3 weeks with little more to do then speak and listen.  The teacher, Mr. JP Mayer, is one of the cooler teachers I've had the pleasure to meet, and he has a really relaxed class setting.  Plus, we played Taboo for 3 hours one day because he didn't have anything else planned - my kind of teacher.  Besides the guy in charge, I've met quite a few other cool cats that I doubt I would have come across otherwise.  It's surprising how quickly you get to know people when you spend 6 and a half hours a day with them... well, maybe not that surprising.  In other news, the Eagle Project is finally coming together.  I've got approval from most everyone for it, and I'm planning to start the real work on it the week of July 12th.  If anyone needs some YES hours or anything of the sort, I'll be needing volunteers for any day that week most likely from 8:00 in the morning (early, but at least you miss most the heat) to 12.  For those of you who don't know what I'm doing, I'm taking Barbara Jordan Elementary's blank hardtop and painting it into  urlLink this .  I suppose that'll be good for now.  Check out the song of the day or so in my profile!  By the way, what do you think of the background image?  I like the image itself, but is it too hard to read the actual entries?

       I've got a bike   The past two days I've tried my luck at cycling, and I think it suits me a bit better than running.  If anyone's interested in joining me on a 5-10 mile bike ride, let me know.  I'll probably be up for one any day of the week, so just IM or call me about it.  Also, I need to get a much more padded bike seat.  My rear is a wee bit sore from just two rides, and I don't quite like it.  Lyrics of the day brought to you by  The Shins , with their song  New Slang .  And if you'd 'a took to me like  A gull takes to the wind,  Well, I'd 'a jumped from my tree   And I'd a danced like the king of the eyesores   And the rest of our lives would 'a fared well.

      There is a very  very  thin line between chillin' and being bored out of your mind.

       I'm sick of spending these lonely nights, training myself not to care.  --Interpol in the song NYC   Eagle Project's approved.  Work is scheduled to begin the week of 7/19 and will go from 9 in the morning to 12-3 in the afternoon, depending on the day.  Call me if you want in on the service hours or feel like lending a hand.  I like these short entries.  Leaves more up to the imagination.

      Big thanks to Jack, Erik, Sara, Meg, David, Daniel, Ashley, and Melissa.  And I mean BIG.  One big step towards eagle is complete (for the most part) - I'll post pictures later.   In other news, I love, love, love stress.  Love it.  That's why I'm so broken up about switching to advanced Gov. tomorrow.  But alas, it is something I must do.  I really cannot handle that packet with everything else I have to get done.  Screw it.  I have better things to spend my time on, and I most certainly do not need this much anxiety before school even starts.  So to you, good packet, bah!   In more other news, teching (or whatever you want to call walking around the marching field) beats the hell out of marching.  Yeah for that!  And yeah for not being as sick anymore!  And yeah for my own Conn 8D (french horn)!   And yeah for ending a blog on a happy note!
