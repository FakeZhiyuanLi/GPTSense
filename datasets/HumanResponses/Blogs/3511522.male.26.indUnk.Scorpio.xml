        I sit alone, a dark theater, Watching the people arrive hand in hand, everybody but me. Oh... I stay behind, watching the credits roll by.  Roll, roll, roll right by me.  Well I know, I won't cry cause there is somebody, somebody,  Somebody waiting for me out in the rain. I won't cry, not tonight, Cause there is somebody waiting for me. Ohhhhh yeahhh.  I take a walk, The streets are busy tonight, And I'm searching for you,  Waiting to brush your shoulder. When I'm alone, I watch the faces roll by. Roll, roll, roll right by me.  Well I know, I won't cry cause there is somebody, somebody,  Somebody waiting for me, out in the rain. I won't cry, not tonight, Cause there is somebody waiting for me.  How many words will go unspoken? Ohh. 'Til I hear knocking on my door? I need some talking the nights I spent heartbroken. But tonight I know, I won't cry no more. Ohhhh.  I lie awake. I left the porch light on. I hope it helps you to find your way.  Outside I hear the thunder roll by. Roll, roll, roll right by me.  I know, I won't cry cause there is somebody, somebody,  Somebody waiting for me, out in the rain. Not gonna cry tonight No Cause there is somebody waiting for me. Not gonna cry tonight No no no no no no no Oh yeah Oh ohhhh, not gonna cry, Not tonight Cause there is somebody waiting for me. I stay behind watching the credits roll by.  Roll, roll, roll right by me.

        Well I was drivin' down I-95 the other night.  Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.  I decided it wasn't gonna do any good to get mad.  So I wrote a song about him instead.  It goes like this...   Were you born an asshole?  Or did you work at it your whole life?  Either way it worked out fine  'cause you're an asshole tonight.   Yes you're an A S S H O L E...  And don't you try to blame it on me.  You deserve all the credit.  You're an asshole tonight.   You were an asshole yesterday.  You're an asshole tonight.  And I've got a feelin'  you'll be an asshole the rest of your life.   And I was talkin' to your mother  just the other night.  I told her I thought you were an asshole.  She said, "Yes. I think you're right."   And all your friends are assholes  'cause you've known them your whole life.  And somebody told me  you've got an asshole for a wife.   Were you born an asshole?  Or did you work at it your whole life?  Either way it worked out fine  'cause you're an aaaass...hole tonight.

        I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons; Finally content with a past I regret. I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness -  For once I'm at peace with myself. I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long. I'm moving on.  I've lived in this place and I know all the faces; Each one is different, but they're always the same. They mean me no harm but it's time that I faced it: They'll never allow me to change. But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong. I'm moving on.  I'm moving on, at last I can see That life has been patiently waiting for me. And I know there's no guarantee But I'm not alone. There comes a time in everyone's life When all you can see are the years passing by, And I have made up my mind that those days are gone.  I sold what I could, and packed what I couldn't, Stopped to fill up on my way out of town. I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't. I had to lose everything to find out. Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road.

        I know when he's been on your mind That distant look is in your eyes I thought with time you'd realized its over, over It's not the way I choose to live And something, somewhere's got to give As sharing this relationship gets older, older You know I'd fight for you But how can I fight someone  Who isn't even there I've had the rest of you Now I want the best of you I don't care if that's not fair  Cause I want it all or nothing at all There's nowhere left to fall When you've reached the bottom It's now or never Is it all or are we just friends Is this how it ends  With a simple telephone call You leave me here with nothing at all  There are times it seems to me I'm sharing you in memories I feel it in my heart But I don't show it, show it And then there's times you look at me As though I'm all that you can see Those times I don't believe its right I know it, know it Don't make me promises Baby you never did know how to keep them well I've had the rest of you Now I want the best of you It's time to show and tell  Cause I want it all or nothing at all There's nowhere left to fall When you've reached the bottom It's now or never Is it all or are we just friends Is this how it ends With a simple telephone call You leave me here with nothing....  Cause you and I Could lose it all if you've got no more room No room inside  For me in your life  Cause I want it all or nothing at all There's nowhere left to fall It's now or never  Is it all or nothing at all There's nowhere left to fall When you've reached the bottom ItæŠ¯ now or never Is it all or are we just friends Is this how it ends With a simple telephone call You leave me here with nothing at all  Or nothing at all There's nowhere left to fall When you've reached the bottom ItæŠ¯ now or never Is it all or are we just friends Is this how it ends With a simple telephone call You leave me here with nothing at all

        I've seen the storm clouds in your past. But rest assured 'cause you are safe at home at last. I rescued you, you rescued me. And we're right where we should be when we're together.   I know the questions in your mind, But go ahead and ask me one more time. You'll find the answer's still the same. It won't change from day to day, for worse or better.   Will I promise to be your best friend? And am I here until the end? Can I be sure I have been waiting for you? And did I say my word is true? Baby, I will, I am, I can, I have, I do.   I know the time will disappear, But this relationship we're building on will always be here. No way that this is sinking sand: On this solid rock we'll stand forever.   Will I promise to be your best friend? And am I here until the end? Can I be sure I have been waiting for you? And did I say my word is true? Baby, I will, I am, I can, I have, I do.

        What a perfect question for me.  I should have learned my lesson long ago.  If its too good to be true, then it is.  I met this wonderful girl, and now she says she dont know what to do.  She says she is still in love with one of her exs and that its not fair to date someone, when she cant give it her all.  I am willing to take that chance and only get whatever she will offer me now.  I know i am a good person, and that if just given half a chance she will realize that i can possibly be that person that she needs in her life to be happy.  I used to think that id never be happy.  It was all starting to make sense to me long before i even met her.  But for some reason it only takes a split second to lose all you have worked for.  I was really beginning to think that my life was gonna be great.  I cant even get that chance to show her anything.  We have talked on the phone, on here, and even met.  I guess i dont understand why we even did all we did if its just gonna end up like this.  I dont regret anything about us meeting or talking except that i must not be the best man for her in her eyes.  I feel like she talked to him last night, and they might get back together or something.  Maybe i dont know what i am talking about, but i sure can tell you whatever it is, it hurt me to talk to her tonight.  I feel like i lost something, and to be frank with you, i never even had her.  I fear that tonight will be the last time i get to even talk to her.  I fear that she will avoid my phone calls and messages on the internet.  Well i am off to bed, got a long day tomorrow.  So Ava if you read this, pls understand that i have no intentions on hurting you or wasting your time.  I hope you will call me and say yes we can still go out and do whatever.  It would really mean alot to me.  So until next time, Goodnight!

        I have to say, just by meeting a person, its funny how you can change your whole outlook on things.  If i had only known how simple it was to change things in your life, i would have started a long time ago.  Most of the stuff i read on peoples journals are about sad stuff.  I am gonna do my best to write about only happy stuff.  I know everyone has those bad days, where you cant smile no matter how hard you try.  I started my day off great today, then for some reason, it went from great to terrible in a second.  I thought to myself, what can i do?  Do i just let it be terrible, or do i make the most out of the day.  I chose to make the most out of it.  It ended up being a very good day.  I came home and was about to take a nap, when the phone rang.  It was my aunt Linda wanting to know if i wanted to ride along with her and my mom.  I used to do everything with my mom.  I really miss those good ol days.  Its not very often that i get to do that kind of stuff with her anymore.  I had a very good time, just riding along with them even though i didnt buy anything.  For some odd reason we always end up laughing about something that we had done in the past or something that we just did.  I cant tell you enough how much i enjoy doing those things with them.  Well enough about that, let me tell you about my cousin.  My cousin has met a girl, and we dont really hang out much anymore, because of her.  She is a great girl and i really think that he is happy.  It makes me happy to see him happy.  I to have met a girl and i feel happier also.  I dont even know her all that well, but we get along so well so far.  Well at least i think we get along great.  She is still talking to me, so i must be doing something right.  We have a date on friday night for sure, and not sure about sat. yet.  We dont have a whole lot of money, so im sure as to just all what were are gonna do, but id be happy just going for a simple walk and talking, or even just hanging out on a porch swing talking.  Im scared that i am gettin my hopes up too soon, but its hard not to, when you meet a good person.  I am so sick of the dating game and all the games that people want to play.  She seems really honest and tells me what she thinks.  I hope friday goes really well, so wish me luck, and i will be sure and let you know how it went also.  Let me close this by saying...I CANT WAIT TILL FRIDAY!

        I had a great day today.  I got up and went outside to a wonderful day.  I started my day off, by waxing my car and detailing the inside really well.  I take great pride in cleaning my car.  I had to go to a baseball game at 6pm, and i usually show up about an hour early with all the kids to talk to them and watch them warm up.  But today i didnt get to make it there that early.  I got on the computer and this girl that i have been talking to for a few days or so was on.  We talked for a few, and then decided to go ahead and meet to see if we like each other on more of a physical thing.  We talk on the phone and on the computer, and we get along great.  She really makes me smile when i see she is online or when i talk to her on the phone.  I have had so many bad experience in meeting people off the internet, so needless to say i was a ball of nerves.  She called me and told me she was about 5 mins or way or so, and then i really started to freak out.  Then she pulled in and i was like phew, finally a good one that didnt lie about what she looked like.  I told her she looked better in person than in a picture.  I really didnt think that she would like me as much as i liked her.  So we drove around for a few, and i really had to get back home to get to that baseball game, so she followed me up to the game.  When we got to the game, all the people i know was giving me crap about which girl this one is, and the boys on the baseball team were going nuts.  My cousin kept yelling at her telling her that he was my cousin.  His bestfriend Dillon was saying to her, that i was gonna adopt him.  I was thinking to myself, oh man what is she thinking.  When i walk in with her, i was like all smiles.  Its funny how just having someone with you makes you feel better about who you are, even if its nothing serious just yet.  I was having a great day, and then i met her and it was like how can it get any better.  I wish she could have stayed longer and seen the kids play baseball.  We ended up winning in the 5th inning, by ten running them.  The final score to the game was 18 to 5.  I havent seen those kids play any better.  The showed up to play some baseball tonight.  So after the game, i took the baseball stuff back to my cousins house and i seen his son there.  I told him good game Parker, but he wasnt even concerned about how he played, just about where that girl went and why she left so early.  I asked him what he thought of her, and all he could say man she was hot and that she was a hottie.  I do have to tell you i agree with him 100%.  Well i just thought id share a little about what i did today with the few of you that do read this.  Hope you are as happy for me as i am.  Until tomorrow god only knows what will happen.  I cant wait to talk to her again and soon......

        I think that the company i work for should listen to this song and understand how important its employees are.  They think we are just some clock number and dont have feelings or pride.  Maybe if they took the time to say Thank You once in a while, then it wouldnt be so hard for people to believe in their job.  I think i am one of the few left that really do care about their job and take pride in how hard they work.  So this song is for all the company people that dont think we are important!    There are people in this country who work hard every day Not for fame or fortune do they strive But the fruits of their labor are worth more than their pay And it's time a few of them were recognized  Hello Detroit auto workers, let me thank you for your time You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line  This is for the one who swings the hammer, driving home the nail Or the one behind the counter, ringing up the sale Or the one who fights the fires, the one who brings the mail For everyone who works behind the scenes  You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields In the city streets and the quiet country towns Working together like spokes inside a wheel They keep this country turning around  Hello Kansas wheat field farmer, let me thank you for your time You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line Hello West Virginia coal miner, let me thank you for your time You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line  This is for the one who drives the big rig, up and down the road Or the one out in the warehouse, bringing in the load Or the waitress, the mechanic, the policeman on patrol For everyone who works behind the scenes  With a spirit you can't replace with no machine Hello America let me thank you for your time

        It ain't nothin' but a small frame house on an acre lot It ain't that much diff'rent from any other house on the block And it may not look like we got all our share of the promise But at least one thing's for sure, I got it honest  Roll out of the sack every mornin', head on down to the mill Give 'em all I got for eight, 'cause that's the deal If you'll check out my paycheck Well, you'll see that there ain't that much on it But ev'ry single penny I'm paid, I got it honest  I never had to hang my head in shame For puttin' a price tag on my name Never turned my back on what I believe Or let my heart be ruled by greed 'Cause buddy if I didn't earn it, I don't want it That way I can always say, I got it honest  Now you ain't looking at some dude That was born with a Silver spoon in his mouth And I might seem like some kind of low-life To that high-falutin' crowd But I'm plain spoken, straight talkin' And damn proud of what I have acomplished Some folks appreciate that and some don't But, I got it honest  Now when I die, I may not leave my kids a fortune But I hope they know'd my life stood for things that were important And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma It made me every ounce of what I am and I got it honest  I never had to hang my head in shame For puttin' a price tag on my name Never turned my back on what I believe Or let my heart be ruled by greed 'Cause brother if I didn't earn it, I don't want it That way I can always say, I got it honest Friend there ain't no doubt about it, I got it honest

        How do you say no to people when they ask you to do something for them, that you dont want to do?  I always just say yes, that way i dont have to hear about it.  When did i lose my backbone?  I need to take a stand and live my life how i want to live it.  But like i said in a previous post, then i am the bad guy, or i am mad.  Why cant i just get what i want out of life instead of what everyone else wants?

        I want to dedicate this song to my mom.  I used to treat her so bad when i was a kid, and she is still there for me even after all that.  So mom, this one is for you.  I Love You, and I Am Sorry!  Live your life to the fall With a lifetime of smiles Made us know right from wrong Always knowing a lie You made us to be tough But never too rough Rise above what you said Never easily lead.  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song I wrote it for you It won't take all day Just a minute or two  You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song  So I'll try and go on Loving all that we know Through the hardest of times you put on a show  You made us stand tall When all around us would fall Even when you were alone You believed you could fly  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song I wrote it for you It won't take all day Just a minute or two  You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song We wrote it for you It'll take all our lives Just to help us get through You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song

        Where do i begin?  I feel that nobody understands who i am, or what i want from life.  I feel like the best friend that i have is my job.  How bad can that be, to think that your best friend is your job.  I got laid off from my job on Feburary 27th, and i have no idea if i will ever get called back.  So i feel like i have lost the best part of me on that day.  The money situation is gettin worse by the day, but i want to keep hope that i will get my job back.  I gave everything i had everyday that i worked there.  But i never realized that nobody even noticed how hard i worked and how much i wanted to be the best at what i do.  All i ever got from anyone was to be used.  I was always the one that had to run the bad jobs, because nobody else would or could.  Maybe if people gave what i gave everyday, the company wouldnt think so bad of its employees.  I hear all the time how people hate their job and this place.  I can only say it is only what you make it.  If you dont like it, then leave, quit, or just shut up and do your job.  Enough about my job, god knows this is boring the hell out of you if your still reading it now.    Well should i talk about my life and how i feel when i am alone?  Do i even have enough time to write all that in one night?  I think id be here all night.  I wonder sometimes if i am only happy when i got money or if i am at work.  I think that people think i am happy all the time, but little do they know that i am not.  I feel like i can put on a good show when i need to.  I take a lot of crap from people about things, and i feel like im the one who the jokes on all the time.  I just sit back and laugh with them, wondering if it will ever stop or if i am really what people say.  I guess ill never know, because i am to that point where i just let it go.  I used to get mad and say something, but that never got me anywhere.  I feel like i am always there for people and that only a select few really appreciate what i do or try to do for them.  I have someone in my life that thinks im gonna be here forever to do what they need.  I never get anything back from them and i am always there when i am called upon.  When i start doing things the way i want and living like like i want, im the bad guy or im in a bad mood or something.  Why cant i just have a day to myself without people thinking im mad at the world.  I know over the years of growing up, i havent been the best person to be around, but i am not as bad as people think i am.  I just want to be understood in a way, that i dont think anyone will ever know.  I feel like i am alone all the time, even when i am with friends or family.  I had everything that i wanted in my life as a kid growing up, but i never had that quality family love.  I guess that is why i am the way i am.  I am the one that can change all this, but i dont know if i know how or if i even have the energy to do so.  Im gonna put some song lyrics on here, that kinda sum up how i feel about things.    What About Me?  Well there's a little boy waiting at the counter of the corner shop  He's been waiting down there, waiting half the day,  They never ever see him from the top  He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground,  He gets to his feet and he says...    What about me? It isn't fair  I've had enough, now I want my share  Can't you see, I wanna live  But you just take more than you give   Well, there's a pretty girl serving at the counter of the corner shop  She's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream,  Her dreams walk in and out, they never stop  Well, she's not too proud, to cry out loud  She runs to the street and she screams...    More than you give...   Take a step back and see the little people  They might be young, but they're the ones that make the big people big  So listen as they whisper:  "What about me?"   And now I'm standing on the corner, all the world's gone home  Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved  And I'm feeling cold and alone  I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot  But sometimes I wish for more than I've got...   What about me?  What about me?  What about....me?  Well i wonder if anyone will get anything from this, since i am only writing to myself here.  The people i want to read this and see how i feel, will never get the chance.  I dont want to have to explain everything about my life to them over and over again, knowing that they wont understand or even care.  So i guess ill just leave it at Poor Me!

        I've had enough of danger And people on the streets I'm looking out for angels Just trying to find some peace Now I think it's time That you let me know So if you love me Say you love me But if you don't just let me go...  'Cos teacher There are things that I don't want to learn And the last one I had Made me cry So I don't want to learn to Hold you, touch you Think that you're mine Because it ain't no joy For an uptown boy Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  When you were just a stranger And I was at your feet I didn't feel the danger Now I feel the heat That look in your eyes Telling me no So you think that you love me Know that you need me I wrote the song, I know it's wrong Just let me go...  And teacher There are things That I don't want to learn Oh the last one I had Made me cry So I don't want to learn to Hold you, touch you Think that you're mine Because it ain't no joy For an uptown boy Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  So when you say that you need me That you'll never leave me I know you're wrong, you're not that strong Let me go  And teacher There are things That I still have to learn But the one thing I have is my pride Oh so I don't want to Hold you, touch you Think that you're mine Because there ain't no joy For an uptown boy Who just isn't willing to try  I'm so cold Inside Maybe just one more try...
