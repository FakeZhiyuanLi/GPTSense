      From cnn.com:  'After Cheney's statement on CNBC, the commission asked the vice president to come forward with any additional information he could provide about any ties between al Qaeda and Iraq.  'One Cheney aide who spoke on condition of anonymity dismissed Tuesday's commission statement, calling it a "nonstory."'  ###  Wait a second.  Your boss possibly lies to congress about information, and probably lies about the reasons he's giving for going to war and killing people, and is accused of lying by a commission he helped to form, and that's a "nonstory"?  What is a "story"?

      I spent the Fourth of July in Pacific Beach, and something that came up in conversations with people was the savageness of the entire celebration.  It wasn't in the intent, but in the execution.  The entire beach was covered in people out only to get drunk and have a good time - there was almost nothing about patriotism at all, and all pretenses to civility were absent.  From pits with girls wrestling to trampolines for them to bounce on to kiddy pools filled with beer, there was a void of morals on the beach - it made me very sad, and made everyone in our group uncomfortable.  I think that if the people who authored the Declaration had seen it they would have been disappointed.  It was savage.

      Some people are born into greatness, some achieve greatness, some have greatness thrust upon them.  I think that being born into greatness and having greatness thrust upon you are two things you can't really control - perhaps you can set yourself up to receive it, but if you're naturally gifted than you're naturally gifted, and if you have greatness thrust upon you then you're just receiving it.  Achieving greatness, though - I think that's where people who aren't naturally great should spend their time, and I have a hunch that people that achieve greatness do so by focusing on a single thing, or focusing on single things throughout their lives.  You can be a wrestling champion, then a baseball star, then sell insurance and give motivational speeches, and be great at all of these things over one life; you can focus on real estate in New York and achieve greatness there.  The key is focusing.  You're less likely to achieve greatness by being a jack-of-all-trades than by being a master of one.

      Today I spoke to Roselva for a while, and she mentioned that she might be coming to Europe with Jarmilka and I.  Her dad is encouraging her to, and I think it would be good.  Something that came up was that when I tell people about my plans, they're invariably impressed, but I don't really see why.  It seems like most of them have this belief that they could never do something like this, and they're stunned anyone else could.  I guess I'm just not all that surprised that I'm doing it or something - I feel like it's completely possible and almost normal to move.  Rosi said that people were surprised she moved to New York on a whim without knowing anyone; this is just a new continent, but otherwise not that different.    I'm getting a little worried about work.  If I have to end up in Eastern Europe then I end up in Eastern Europe.  I'd very much prefer not to, but I just have to keep telling myself that this is for long-term good.  I know it's going to be harder than I anticipate right now, but I know that if I stay here I'll end up stuck in comfort, which is worse than the hardships I'll face.

      My thought du jour: all of these books on ethics and morals and leadership are fad books designed to make people feel like they are making progress.  Some do have universal appeal and lessons, but very few of them add anything to the grand sum of human knowledge.  People would do better to focus on morals and ethics and on figuring themselves out rather than trying to add fad leadership theories to their knowledge.

      This is the first posting on my blog.  I'm starting it to chronicle my trip to Spain, and I'm getting nervous now - wrapping up work, trying to get all my papers in order, and generally questioning what made me decide to do this in the first place.  Jarmilka's having the same thoughts about Prague - what are we thinking?  Why leave the relative comfort of our existence in San Diego, which could conceivably last indefinitely, for unpredictable Europe?  We obviously have second thoughts, but I'm sure that's normal.

      Tonight Ben and I went out to La Rambla. I’d planned on not going for as long as I could stand, but it seemed like the natural thing to do on a Friday night and we couldn’t very well avoid the inevitable. All the tourists were out, but we ran into surprisingly few Americans. About one a.m. two ladies came up to us looking for a light. I took out my Zippo, and one put her arm around Ben. Suddenly Girl: English? American? Ben: Espagnol y Ingles. Girl: Drinky drinky, sucky sucky, fucky fucky (other one makes the international blow job symbol).  They were real live prostitutes. I’d never seen one up close. One had to wonder what they did in their lives, how they became prostitutes, what an average day/night might be like for them. What was their natural habitat was before they were captured by the city and the economy? What did they eat? One was missing teeth, the other had a huge burn mark across her chest. They had an air of desperation about them, and they were both really, really sad.  That’s all I remember. Ben wrenched out of the grip of his girl and we kept walking, all the while checking our pockets to make sure they weren’t pickpockets.  Come to think of it, I actually wanted to see a pickpocket in action. I really wanted to catch one, to confront them, take them out if necessary (and it would have been necessary). It was all scripted. There was going to be an initial confrontation, where I demanded that they return the stolen wallet/purse/camera to the victim. They would deny it, then attempt to stun me with a poorly thrown punch, which would be blocked easily. Then I would deliver a roundhouse kick to the stomach, a follow up punch to the face, and a good knee sweep to take them to the ground. Then I would have returned the wallet/purse/camera and bowed and walked away with everyone giving me golf claps. I would wave, wink, point people out and thank them for their support, and everyone would have loved me. Vigilante action – it would have been great.  I moved into a room about 50% bigger, with a queen-sized bed, kitchen table and a lot more horizontal space – I even have drawers now. I’ve also managed to blow the power out with my computer 4 times so far. The plugs just don’t work – it’s almost like they installed different voltages in the same apartment. Hopefully our landlady, Gigi, will be able to explain. Gigi is a Chilean woman who moved here with her mother and son, and she dresses in long flowing silk dresses with matching head scarves, and she smokes hand-rolled cigarettes and drinks drain-cleaning-strength black coffee.  She´s really great - a real character in all the best ways.  I would say she was a hippie if she didn’t have her head so squarely on her shoulders most of the time. I think she rents out the rooms to cover the mortgage, which is a great idea, especially at this time in Barcelona´s history. She also has a great relationship with her son, Bruno.  Last night, though, at about 3 a.m., she returned from the bars to find Bruno waiting in the foyer, punishing her for lateness with a trip to her room. Bruno is perhaps 16, really likes AC/DC, and has a shirt with a picture of Frank Zappa sitting on a toilet. He picks up where Gigi leaves off; for example, yesterday he was the only one around who knew how to work the washing machine or restore power to the apartment. Good kid.

      When I got into Barcelona, I didn’t fill out a customs form because nobody gave me one – I think they might have come with the meals, which I didn’t order. I got to the customs and immigration window and told the man that I didn’t have one but that I’d be happy to fill one out. He looked at my passport, got this, "Don’t be stupid," look on his face, stamped it and said I didn’t need the form. So except in a few airline computers, I’m not even here.  It’s a little past 2 a.m. on my second day in Spain. Technically – I’ve been here about 10 hours so far. I’m set up in this long apartment – it has a huge hall with rooms on each side, and views of a major street at one end and the rest of the city at the other. Two guys from the previous course are still here and they said it’s one of the best apartments available. I have a fairly spacious room with huge wooden closets on an entire wall (half of which are filled with the clothes of the girl that had this apartment before me) and a window looking out into a alley/column. It’s hard to explain – I’ll take pictures.  I met one other guy on my course – Ben. The woman that showed us around the city tonight said that good apartments here can be had for about $250-300 per month, and that the average wage in Barcelona is about $1000 per month. Gym membership is about $35 per month, and Spanish classes can be had for $90 per month. If I’m good with my money I can stay here for one to two months and look for jobs after my course until I either find something or I have to move elsewhere (like Poland). It’s looking increasingly likely that I might be able to find something here.  I’m exhausted, but good. I need to sleep, and tomorrow I’m going to get a run in, do some shopping and try to get on schedule. However, even though it’s 2 a.m. on a Wednesday, it doesn’t appear that I’m at all alone in being up this late – the streets and cafes are filled with people, all looking fresh and rested and ready to keep going, sleep a little and work tomorrow.  I got a number of bloody noses on the plane. I think it was a combination of the dry air and the fact that I was blowing my nose all the time since I’m sick. It was ridiculous – I kept on having to go to the bathroom to get Kleenex or toilet paper, and I had all these wads of wet, bloody tissue paper. I found a use for it, though – I hid my passport and wallet in inner pockets of my cargo shorts and put the wads of bloody tissue in the most accessible pockets, thus ensuring that if a pickpocket tried to get into those pockets he/she would find a biohazard.  I found the Grand Lodge of Spain today with the help of Ben and Jenny Koskinen, Saara’s friend. It’s almost completely unmarked, with tinted windows and an imposing interior (I peeked inside). Truly beautiful.  I’m sure there will be more tomorrow, but for now I’m going to sleep.

      1) The front door of my apartment building is sometimes locked, sometimes not.&nbsp; It's up in the air if you have to use your key or not.&nbsp;  2) I theoretically live on the fourth floor, but it should be the sixth.&nbsp; I know what you're thinking - Americans, they don't know that people here don't consider the ground floor the first floor.&nbsp; I took that into account - in America I would live on the seventh floor.&nbsp; In France or theUK it would be the sixth.&nbsp; I am going to find someone to explain that to me.  Pictures being added to my galleries as I write!

      Well, in the technical sense.&nbsp; They just stamped my passport when I came in - the guy said I didn't need an entrance slip.&nbsp; Very strange.  I'm here and will post more when I get a chance.&nbsp; A few observations from my trip:  'Airplane Philosopher' should be a term used more often to describe people that get philosophical when they are in positions where they feel they have no control.&nbsp;   Girls in Spain aren't too big on thongs.&nbsp;   Beer is cheaper than juice here.&nbsp; I thought I would stop drinking alcohol to really save money, but it turns out it won't work.&nbsp;   You can get a scooter for $300.&nbsp; Insurance for a year is $300, too, and you don't need a license.&nbsp; So if I stay, I'm out $600.&nbsp;

      Today, talking on the phone with Jarmilka, I seemed to suddenly realize the enormity of what we're about to do.&nbsp; It's not scary so much as shocking.&nbsp; The reactions of people that were shocked and excited seemed strange to me - I thought that it was normal for me to move to Spain and they all seemed incredulous.&nbsp; Now if someone I knew was going to do this, I'd be in awe at their choice&nbsp;- I guess other people saw earlier how much this move involves.&nbsp;   Jarmilka's handling it well - she's sort of freaking out right now, and letting it show, which I think is healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I never realized how much work was required when moving to a different country.&nbsp; My parents have been especially supportive of me, although my mom doesn't really want me to leave.&nbsp; Today we had a little beach party with some really great people, and Jill Chlebeck taught some beach volleyball skills, Shimona brought some great beef kebabs, and Jarmilka was an organizing pro.&nbsp; It's sad to think that most of those people I won't see for a long, long time.&nbsp;   I'm sick.&nbsp; Not bragging - I'm physically ill.&nbsp; Nose, throat, fever.&nbsp;   Everything is down to two duffel bags and a carry-on.&nbsp; I am even bringing a few luxuries, like incense.&nbsp; It's exciting!&nbsp;   I'm torn between keeping this for myself and keeping it for other people.&nbsp; I think it'll have to be a mixture of both.&nbsp; For other people, I'll write about updates; for myself, I want to chronicle what's going on in my head during this transition period.&nbsp;

      Something I noticed is that while I'm pulling away from things and people, other people seem to be more interested in clinging to me because they know I'm leaving.  Internally, I'm distancing myself from San Diego and everything in it so that it's easier to leave without attachments, but at the same time I feel pressure to hang out with people as much as possible.  The people staying still have lives to maintain; for me, much of my life here is over.    I think that goodbye dinners do more good for the people staying than for the people leaving.

      I know that this post might seem obsessive to some, but when you get close to leaving you don't think about anything but time.  It's not just the 26 days left before I get on the plane, or the fact that it's only just more than 4 weeks, which is roughly equivalent but is really different than one month - it's also the 7 minutes before 10 a.m., the 8 hours left in my working day, and the time lost in inaction and fitting everything into the time I do have.    This morning I pulled out books I'd like to take.  I figure it's most efficient and logical to take anthologies, but then I pulled out most of my anthologies and they would take up a large backpack themselves.  Dale Carnegie books, the Bible, Morals and Dogma - there's too much good stuff to read.  An argument for e-books.

      Confession: I never really thought Spanish would ever be useful to me. I mean, it might help me talk to people about water, socks, vegetables or bathrooms, and it would probably look good on graduate school applications, but I didn’t think it would ever really come in handy in my daily life. That attitude has really helped my self esteem when dealing with the fact that I know almost no Spanish; if knowing Spanish isn’t applicable to my overall daily life then it doesn’t affect my ego if I have am stupid when I hear the words la silla or la correa mojada or el tiburon loco.  Today, I was waiting for Ben to check the map in the metro so we could go home from the topless beach. Out of the crowd a beautiful girl walked up to me and kissed me on my cheeks. I was convinced she thought I was someone else, so I just tried to keep up the illusion for as long as possible – maybe I’d somehow trick her with my ability to say, "Quieres una naranja?" and get an invitation back to her apartment, or if not I might at least expect a polite full-mouth kiss for my efforts. She said something in Spanish, and I said something brilliant, like, "My name is Andrew" – in English, of course. She looked confused, said some more stuff, and this time Ben heard it; apparently she was really trying hard to find out if I was just waiting there, if I was with anyone, etc., and I just had no idea what she was talking about. Ben spat out a sentence which roughly translated to, "He doesn’t speak Spanish, but he’s an ok guy if he’s sober." However, he might have just as well said, "Andrew is only interested in sleeping with blow-up dolls" – she got embarrassed and said something like, "Oh, it’s all good, thanks," and walked away. I was still so surprised that she did that I couldn’t call after her, even in English.  I frantically looked through my pockets a couple of minutes later – that would have been a great trick for a pretty thief. I’m still waiting to take one out.
