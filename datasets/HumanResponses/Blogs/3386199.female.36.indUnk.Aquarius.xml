      cathartic ramblings - that's how my friend, Shannon, described her blog writings.  well -that can only be a good thing.  as for myself, i could sure use some catharcism!  i have 3 children.  2 from a previous marriage and 1 new baby.  i was married for 8 years to a very nice man - our girls are 12 & 8.  people are always asking why i got divorced and seem disappointed when i have no juicy gossip to give them - we just weren't "together" anymore and i chose to make it official.  after 4 years of being divorced, i decided to move from texas to colorado.  the kids stay with me during summer and all school breaks - i also got a job with an airline so they could fly back and forth more often.  it actually works pretty well - and they are supposed to come live with me in 2 years for school and do vacations with their dad.  i hope they still want to do it when the time comes - i have always told them they didn't HAVE to if it would be super awful for them but i think they want to - they just like their school/friends.  their dad remarried a very nice girl - who has 2 girls also.  we have known her since high school.  her oldest daughter is actually coming for 2 weeks this summer (she came up last summer too) and people think that's weird.  of course - people also have to comment (when i bring up my girls moving with me soon) that "they didn't realize i had custody of my children."  well - i'm not on parole or anything.  i've been having a hard time dealing with other people's preconceived notions on who i am, i guess.  after i had lived here just a week, i met a nice, young policeman - not really my type - and we married in 2001.  thus, the baby that i mentioned was born in september of 2003.  she keeps me busy and exhausted.  i only work seasonally (ski season) at the airport here and i have learned that i reallly need a job in order to be a whole person.  a life-giving job as well - not just something that i stand around at.  and where i live - pop. 6000, there aren't any!  my education level could be higher - i only have a 2 year degree, but i have a lot of professional experience and have run my own businesses in the past.  someone suggested to me the other day that i apply to cashier at safeway.  again.  i'm NOT on parole.    i'm definitely having a hard time with this "job thing."  for the most part, i'm not taken seriously and can't get my foot in the door - then the jobs i DO get interviews for - well, i'm overqualified.  like i don't know that?  what i do know is that my checkbook is more dead than it has ever been and diapers aren't cheap.  my husband pays the bills - but we need more than that.  we moved away last year - to a town near denver (out of these mountains) but it was disgusting - so we moved back to have the baby here and give this area another try - i really thought something would work out!  guess not.  i was watching tv - i do a lot more of that these days than i usually do; only so much you can do with a baby in one hand - and this "older" actress was complaining about the lack of work for overage actors in hollywood.  now - this isn't hollywood, i know.  but she was describing exactly how i was feeling.  there's only so many "good" jobs - and they are taken or have people already in mind to take them later.  it's disappointing.  well, that's good for today...
