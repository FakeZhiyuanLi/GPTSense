       Hey I haven't wrote in a while but nothing really exciting has happened.&nbsp; Just been sitting around being lazy.&nbsp; We finally got the basement finished, it looks pretty cool. I don't know if I said that in my last post or not, but i don't want to go back and check.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today I was either on here, listening to music, or talking on the phone.&nbsp; It was pretty boring.&nbsp; Now I'm sitting here waiting for my dads boss to call so we can find out if we get to go on this boat ride the 31st. Its going to be awesome if we can, we're going with my moms friends family who has a couple boys that are around my age. So I'll have somebody to hang out with. I can't wait so i hope we get to go. Well thats all I really have to say. Buh-Bye!!

       Well today was pretty boring. I didn't do much untill about two this afternoon.&nbsp; This morning I just sat around talked on here and ate pancakes, which were pretty good, I hadn't had them in a long time.&nbsp; Then I got up and finished redoing the basement, well kinda.&nbsp; I can't really do much untill we get some kind of floor to put down there, but we got the coolest zebra print couch from cousin to put down there.&nbsp; So it'll be pretty cool as soon as I get it done.   &nbsp;   Now I'm just sitting here listening to music, becuase theres nothing better to do.&nbsp; You know what I just thought about to.. how like in school you talk to all these people and your friends with them and all then summer comes and u don't even talk to them anymore...lol that just came to my mind.     &nbsp;   Well I'm going to becuase nothing interesting really happened today, and my grandmas here. Buh-Bye!!

I dance, sing and cheer but I'm not going to talk about that, its no good lol.&nbsp; Well my life is pretty boring so this probally won't be that great to read but its somthing for me to do.        &nbsp;   Well today I stayed home and cleaned out the basement, we got a pretty cool couch to put down there. Black and zebra print, and tomorrow me and my sister are going to finish it up.&nbsp; Yesterday I about got in a whole bunch of trouble because two of my guy friends came over when I was home alone and my grandpa decided to stop by so ya know how that goes. I thought i was going to be in&nbsp;a hell of a lot of trouble but my dad saved my ass.&nbsp; Thank god for him!        &nbsp;   Well I don't really have that much to write about tonight so&nbsp;I'll try to remeber to write again tomorrow. Actually it probally won't be that hard to forget because I'm not going to be doing much tomorrow. So thats all for tonight...Bye!
