      It did, too. At 4pm I was relaxing, thinking "I can't believe how much I get paid for this..." Ah, Sunday. Has all the potential to be the best day of the working week. Unfortunately, because I got smarmy, the shift was cursed. For all of us. At 4.45 I was dodging punches and being called every name under the sun. Apparently, if I didn't get killed whilst at work tonight, I would certainly be on the way to my car tonight. Damn it. I don't have the absolute best head in the world, but I am attached enough to it that I don't want it to be blown off or smashed in.   Suffice to say I made it home. Tonight. Drunks-they are only tough while they remember who they hate.   So, after hours spent on security guards' forms, police statements and incident reports..back to my little room to catch up on 3 hours of neglected work. Again, damn. The cranky man is calling me a useless bitch because he missed his cup of tea.....the crazy man is naked again and has peed on the floor. The dying man's family is in attendance and I just have no answer as to why he is tied to the bed......and my gorgeous little saviour in the corner has somehow turned "bad" and slaps me when I gently encourage him to take his pills. I retreat to my patient in the single room and find her naked and wet too, and crying because she wants to die. I heal what ails her with a cup of tea and a hug-best medicine. All is well in room B, at least.   All in all, I'm glad to leave at 10.15 after 45 minutes of unpaid overtime. Again. Visit the sisters and dad for a cheese binge, and now debriefing to myself before sleep and cuddles with sister3 and the dogs. Owch. I seem to have pulled a muscle useful for typing somwhere along the way, too. Crazy times.......  On alcoholism (to even things up): a quiet week by my standards. Friday found me trying room 19-good food, cute waiters, revolting decor...and then moving on to several pubs before sliming my way in to see spiderbait for free. Pretty good. Am having some sobriety time at present. Boring! If anyone has any tips for staying sober, I'd appreciate them. Even caring for people dying of alcoholic liver disease cant seem to help me quit. I am sure my liver is tough.   Cold hands. Sleep time.  Nurse crazy.

      Hello hello........... So this is where it all begins, my career as a blogger. I'm a nurse. I'm an alcoholic. I can write good. hahaha. Allow me to share my life with you.........  Geez, this feels like doing stand up comendy, I'm all nervous. I love watching standup, the painful anxiety of the would-be comedians is sort of endearing, at the same time as uncomfortable. Perhaps I shall quickly relay an overview of my morning.....a usual morning by all accounts. By 12 noon I had seen 5 men naked. I had handled 5 penises (penis'?? I've never had to write about them in plural before...typical. One day I will perhaps...). I was wearing about 4-5 different body fluids from various patients. By my standards (incredibly all of my standards have dropped even lower since nursing..), I would still call my white dress-"clean". It was a good day-no one died. At least no one in my room, which means I am all but absolved from any guilt, or even more inmportantly-from blame and subsequent lawsuits.   Well. That is enough about work. It's over now and I am visiting my dogs. When I got here they had made somewhat of a mess. I covered for them by completing a whirlwind clean-there is talk of them losing their house privelges, or at least their couch priveleges. Poor bastards, what else have they got? Dried biscuits twice a day. Even the sight of a ball sends them into raptures of joy....kind of like me when I see a beer...SAD.   Oh gosh. Dad just came in and left. I didn't admit I was at his house, did I?......well, I am. He is upset again. As usual it's over money.....I couldn't see the point. I try to educate him. People don't change. Or do they? Not in my family. With remarkable predicability we follow our own and each others patterns. You could say we suck. I suppose most families do.. Hopefully I will one day marry someone whose family sucks in a different way and then I will not realise how much they really do, in fact, suck.   And onto the fun. Must be leaving now to head for home. It is time to wash off the nursing grime, torture my hair into slick sofistication, squeeze my aching body into clothes that in no way gel with the weather and head out for a refined dinner with the other grad nurses. When I say refined, I mean we will get blind drunk, maybe pick up random terrible men and probably vomit. Perhaps then tomorrow I will have a more interesting tale to tell..if not I have many to fall back on.  Ciao and goodnight. Think of me, out in the cold and rain with innapropriate cleavage and a large redback in hand,  Nurse Crazy. xx

      In the pulsar returning from Kalbarri to Perth. Hurting really badly, when we stop the car-my sister and I are unable to walk. Legs are jelly, although I never realised jelly could be so painful. We are almost run down by several trucks, and are overtaken by all. We promise never to tell that road trains are overtaking us. Our headlights are so bad that we can only see, maybe 15 metres in front. We rationalise that in order not to hit a kangaroo we have to drive slowly. Really, we are just shit scared, because we can't see shit.   Stop at lovely Geraldton for food. Starving. All we both want is something that could not have ever been cooked on a camp stove in a gorge, something really special-our first proper meal after 4 days of smokey packet food and urine flavoured river water. In our desperation, we settle on Hungry Jacks. Bad choice. The hicksters at Gerro obviously didnt get properly trained by the big smoke big cheeses (?). Our burgers (aussie, double bacon, double cheese-upsized. oink, oink..) come with unmelted cheese. As we wolf them down we moan about countrified burger techniques. Then we get onionn rings and pudding. Then we get more coke. We both feel sick all the way home. I have to stop at a servo for crampy diarhoea. Thanks, Jacks.  Summary-40 klms over 3 days of crazy hiking and climbing, all whilst carrying a 12 kg backpack......did not burn as much energy as consumed in one big, revolting meal at Hungry Jacks. Once again, Thanks, Jacks. A wasted trip......
