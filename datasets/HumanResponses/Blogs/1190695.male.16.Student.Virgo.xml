      Let's just say I hardly expected to be talking about religion (not matter how indirectly) on my second entry, but such is the world we live in. To set the stage, I'd like to entertain you with a little anecdote:  So the greatest guy in the world - for ambiguity's sake, let's call him "Adrian" - is playing Counter-Strike online one Victoria Day afternoon when a certain individual - who, for ambiguity's sake, we will call "Priscilla" - hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet, signs onto the server Adrian is playing in and changes his screenname to "i fight for allah". Adrian, being such a smart guy, corrects Priscilla, saying Allah is, in fact, spelt with a capital 'A'. To which Priscilla responds, "allah is not my god, so i choose not to capitalize it." Adrian is struck upside the head by this comment, and as a result, ceases to refer to himself in the third-person.  Yes, folks, believe it or not, "Allah" is a proper noun, and as such should be spelt with a capital 'A'. Priscilla's comment is the equivalent of saying "George Bush isn't my president, so I'm not going to capitalize his name" or "I don't drive a Ford, so from now on it will be known as 'mustang'".   Even so, the word "Allah" isn't specific to Islam; it's the Arabic word for "God". Even Arabic Christians and Jews call God "Allah". So, unless Priscilla does not believe in any higher being, Allah  is  technically Priscilla's god.  Ah, but what can one do? Much to my chagrin, I can't spend more than thirty seconds online without coming across this sort of garbage. As a result, I try not to talk much while playing Counter-Strike.  So what does our petulant protagonist do? He proceeds to make Priscilla eat hot lead, four rounds straight. Doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?  The End.

      Yes, this is it. Much to the delight of all connected to the Internet, if not the world, I have decided to start my very own online blog. There shall be rejoicing in the streets! Drinks are on me.  Sarcasm aside, I feel this will be an interesting experience. It's hard to pinpoint my reasons for choosing to publishing my deepest, most personal thoughts only for the world to see. The man living in my right auditory canal, but we'll leave that subject alone for the time being. No, let's focus on a couple succinct, less personal reasons:  1) Being a self-professed geek and technophile, I figure I should have some semblance of a web site, lest my PDA reject my body and eat its way through my pocket, thereby ruining a perfectly good pair of pants. In my history online, I have started exactly three personal web sites, and have finished exactly zero. Let us pray this one will live long enough to catch interest in online communities, making yours truly an Internet sensation overnight. One can dream.  2) A few of my good friends, both online and in that frightening void know as the Real World, have similar online journals. I have yet to come across a trend more worthy of my endorsement.  3) My mind is a raging sea of useless knowledge and half-finished thoughts. Hear that gurgling sound? Could just be the three-day-old leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken using my stomach as a medium to communicate with the living world, but let's not go there. Anyway, I feel I should have a place to write down some of the things that spew forth from my cerebral cortex on an hourly basis.  4) Being at the height of my teenage years, I feel it may be time to indulge in a little navel-gazing and soul-searching. Therefore, during the lifespan of this blog, I will successfully deduce no less than the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You can take my word for it.  Having seen this, I'm guessing that this blog will end up being some odd combination of  urlLink Slashdot  and  The Catcher in the Rye . Nevertheless, a good time will be had by all. I hope I will be able to find the time to stop by and update regularly.  I can see that nearly an hour has passed since I started this composition. The Internet and instant messaging services are indeed powerful forces of distraction. And unwatched episodes of  24  are calling. 'Night.

      According to  urlLink this article , there's a Rainbow Six motion picture in the works. Of course, my first thought was, "it's about freakin' time".  Then I noticed that John Woo will be directing the film. I don't think I've ever gone from overdrive to reverse so quickly. John, stick to Hong Kong shoot-em-up action flicks. That's what you're good at. The Rainbow Six name is neither about slick gunplay nor fancy camera angles.   But who knows? Maybe he'll pull it off. If not, we'll have another  Mission: Impossible 2  on our hands.

      I'm in the process of discovering that it's  really  not easy to find time to update this blog. It seems that new posts have become a weekly occurrence. Hopefully once exams are over in a couple of weeks I'll be able to get on here more frequently. In the meantime, let's go over the past week, in insufferable detail, replete with witty idioms and colloquialisms! I'm quivering just thinking about it!   Wednesday:  Uh, Wednesday. Wednesday... Hmmmm. Must not have been an overly interesting day if I can't remember a thing about it. According to my PDA, I had a math test and the last day of my Accounting summative, but I'll be damned if I can remember. I  do  know my team managed to blow the two-goal lead we had going into the second half. End result: 2-2. No, I didn't score, but at least I didn't have to rip a loose flap of skin off my heel again. Moving on...   Thursday:  Thursday was quite an eventful day, comparatively. My mom finally dragged me across town to the licencing center to get my G1 ("learner's permit", to all the less enlightened out there). Some forms, an eye test, and 40 multiple-choice questions later, and I can now drive! I'm free as a bird! A bird who has to fly with 0.0% blood-alcohol level, an adult with at least four-years flying experience in the passenger seat, an only between one half-hour before sunrise to one half-hour after sunset. But I digress.  It's not that I don't  want  to drive. It's just that I have no  motivation  to start. I'm not going to have my own car, or have regular access to one, and as soon as I pass my road test, I'll be relegated to the position of "taxi driver" for my little sister. Add $600 for driver's ed. and the early onset of grey hair thanks to having to drive with my dad, and the whole thing just didn't seem worth it. Ah, well, things are now in motion.  After working at the library from 3:30-5:30, I got  the  best exercise I've had in months. Certainly felt like it anyway. It seems the Powers That Be decided to have me referee a 14-year-old boys' game way up at Notre Dame High School in north Burlington. Of course, my dad is out of town, and my mom has to work, leaving me stuck with a bicycle as my only means of transportation to said game. Of course, the route I have to take it  uphill , into a headwind, for about 2km. Needless to say, I was puttering along on my grannie gear for most of the trip. Truth be told, though, I'm not in the best shape. On the other hand, coming home was a blast: I'm sure I hit a good 50 clicks going downhill.   Friday:  Friday, hmmmm... Friday. A lot like Wednesday. Got my math test back (aced it), did a Cisco practical exam (aced it), had to work at the soccer club from 6-9. That's just about it.   Saturday:  Six hour shifts at the soccer club are  not  fun. Especially now that the season has started and there's really nothing to do but surf the Internet, random odd job exclusive. So after working 9-3 I came home and... slept? Did homework? Played  Morrowind  for four hours? Your guess is as good as mine. This is why I need to update more often.   Sunday:  Sunday morning I got up and no one was home. It was a nice day, so I went for a walk... and bought a new  urlLink mouse . It was on sale, what can I say? This is why I shouldn't go for walks very often: I always end up buying something. I highly recommend the mouse, by the way.   Monday:  Let's run through this quickly - My Computer Engineering class managed to talk my teacher into letting us write our summative test on Wednesday instead. I say to them, why bother? You're not going to be ready then, either.  - Learned about alkenes in Chemistry. Whee!  - Hung around in Physics class longer than I had to. Double whee!  - Worked at the library 6-9  - Came home and watched the Flames lose the Stanley Cup. While studying for a Cisco exam. Right, "studying".   Tuesday:  That's today, so hopefully I'll be able to remember  something . Wrote my Cisco exam, and got 85%. Pretty good, considering it was on chapters 1-14, and we've only covered 1-8. During lunch I crammed for the Computer Science summative test I had to write last period. After getting out of Accounting early, I went down to the cafeteria to pick up my yearbook, sign a couple others, and participate in some rousing games of euchre. Math class consisted of more yearbooks signing. What do you expect for the second-last day of school? Anyway, the Comp. Sci. test was a breeze, so I was able to go home a bit early.  Which brings us to the here and now. Wasn't that fun?   Now, I must go suffer through another three hours at the soccer club. Ciao!

      With the end of school looming on the horizon, it's hard to find time to check my email these days, much less update a blog. Today's topic is: Random Things That Have Popped Into My Head In The Past Few Days.  1) When browsing through the CD collection at your local public library, please reseat all of the CDs you have flipped forward. It will save the library staff muchos pesos on Advil.  2) Don't you hate it when you accidentally drop something, make an amazing diving/rolling/what-have-you catch, and no one is around to see it?  3)  urlLink Luigi's Conjecture . What a brilliant idea. I must test this newfound theory over the next couple of weeks. Kudos, Scratchy.  Subconsciousness calls, so that is all for now. Until next time!

      In case anybody was wondering, I've been in British Columbia for the past 12 days. It seems I forgot to tell most people, as John called me on my cell phone while I was driving through Revelstoke, BC, on the way to Canmore, Alberta.    Our trip took us through Salmon Arm, BC, to Canmore, Alberta, which is very close to Banff and Banff National Park (read: mountains). Then back to Kelowna, BC, for a couple of days before returning to Vancouver and Surrey to schmooze with the relatives. I'll compose a travelogue over the next couple of days, complete with pictures (I snapped almost a full 256MB SD card full of them).    I'll leave you with a tune by the Arrogant Worms:    'Cause we've got  Rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees   And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And water!     All right, everyone!

      ...and I don't know why. I played billiards for a couple of hours this afternoon, but surely that isn't too strenuous an exercise... Maybe I'm coming down with something.  Anyway, it's been nearly a month since I last posted here. And unfortunately, due to the current unsteady nature of my extremities, I'll have to cut this one short. Perhaps I'll be back tomorrow, after a good night's sleep.   I'm off to watch the Euro 2004 final that my father conveniently taped for me. I'll leave you with this thought-provoking quote:  "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones." -Albert Einstein  Tot volgende tijd!
