      Im really tired of lots fo things. I hate my job. I hate my boss....how can he be so stupid? I hate that blue school. I hate this cold weather...im freezing. I hate driving and i hate that bunch of people begging for money at traffic lights....get a job! I hate being hungry...theres nothing to eat here. I hate teaching. I hate being poor. I hate living in this house. I hate when my brother uses my computer and downloads 1 million songs. I hate when i get home and i realise ill always live here. I hate to know ill never be able to do anything i want just because im stupid. I hate this city but i hate sao paulo more. I hate spending my whole day at that school. I hate my life I hate those guys who stop what theyre doing to stare me...Am i freak?? I hate when people think they can be nice and help me ...i dont need any help. I hate that stupid video "out of the blue" i wish i could kill Pauline slowly....  I hate working until 10  I hate to know my friends always go out in the evening while im teaching I hate to call people and listen to their complaints....why dont they try to b on my shoes for just one day? I hate to know my dad gives everything my brother wants I hate to know my brother stays at home doing nothing but still gets paid because my father is fucking stupid. I hate when my dogs bark for hours I hate to wake up early , go to work and see my boss getting to work late because his alarm clock didnt go off I hate the smell of that school I hate the way people think im irresponsible just because i have a different life style and i hate the way they judge me I hate taking tests every time i look for a new job I hate lots of things...I feel much better now.

      1) What kind of people go to the movies to talk about life? 2) What kind of people go to the movies to bother someone whos really interested in the movie? 3) Where can i find a butt like brad´s to buy?  I had so much fun tonight.....Fabi was really mad at the couple that couldnt stop talking and i was about to stand up and kick that guys ass when Gus talked to him ...nicely. hes so sweet. Stop doing it? Thats what he said.....i created a monster! LOL.  Its almost midnight i ate too much i cant go to bed....i dont want to dream with the sea swallowing me anymore....thats scary....i should learn how to swim.  Tomorrow i have only 4 classes.....ill be free then. Im going out with Eddie tomorrow night.  My day was good....i worked, laughed and once again i tried to explain things...im so tired of it. Everythings so simple but people like to make it complicated.  thats all for now....

      Lately ive been thinking about how nice my life would be if it had a soundtrack.I always imagined how wonderful it would be to have a very sad song right at the moment someones dumping me or a super happy song at the moment im eating chocolate ice cream....umm or a sexy song at the moment im flirting with the hotest guy ever.  I started to write down the name of my fav songs because i want to have my top 100 fav songs. I never really liked Jewel I always thought she was boring but one of her songs is just amazing....its my brothers fault hes in love so he keeps listening to this kind of song all day long....love sucks!  Tomorrows Monday again and i have another job interview....i hate working and dont tell me i should be proud of myself because i can teach sth....actually i cant i just know how to make people believe i can :))  Colleen shouldnt invite me to do crazy things.....damn girl! She knows ill end up doing what she wants.....but i know ill have lots of fun ....well ive never been to canada. And i miss her and im sure ill miss Amanda.  i went to a new park today.....B-O-R-I-N-G....LOL .....everythings boring....maybe im boring and everythings not.....maybe im not from this planet! Maybe im from K-PAX! And thats why i dont think things are fun.....i knew id come up with a good explanation!  You people from earth stay away from me ...im dangerous.  Im selling my heart....good price, its brand new,it was used only 3 times .....wanna buy it?  Just one more thing You can call your baby Ocean because i got another name for my baby. Im not pregnant because im not stupid like someone you know.  I better go.......

      Pictures of You   I've been looking so long at these pictures of you That I almost believe that they're real  I've been living so long with my pictures of you That I almost believe that the pictures are  All I can feel Remembering  You standing quiet in the rain  As I ran to your heart to be near  And we kissed as the sky fell in Holding you close  How I always held close in your fear Remembering  You running soft through the night  You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow And screamed at the make-believe  Screamed at the sky And you finally found all your courage  To let it all go Remembering  You fallen into my arms  Crying for the death of your heart  You were stone white So delicate  Lost in the cold   You were always so lost in the dark Remembering  You how you used to be  Slow drowned  You were angels So much more than everything  Hold for the last time then slip away quietly  Open my eyes  But I never see anything  If only I'd thought of the right words  I could have held on to your heart  If only I'd thought of the right words I wouldn't be breaking apart  All my pictures of you Looking so long at these pictures of you  But I never hold on to your heart  Looking so long for the words to be true But always just breaking apart My pictures of you There was nothing in the world That I ever wanted more  Than to feel you deep in my heart There was nothing in the world  That I ever wanted more Than to never feel the breaking apart All my pictures of you   Pictures .....theyre bad memories even when theyre good theyre still bad...... Its so hard to remember things and actually miss them and know theyll never come back. theres no second chance, theres no let me try again. Its so hard to know that some people are still around but you just cant talk to them for some reason..... ai ai ai ai ....i better get some sleep ive just started to have hallucinations!

Im an expert in fucking things up....at least im good at something :) Im not upset anymore.Life has always been messing with me but it just cant beat me. Im Lia and like it or not nobody can bring me down.....i do feel sad but not longer than 2 or 3 days. Ive received lots of msg , people ive never met, people who want to be nice ans some who want to be mean......thanks everybody ! &nbsp; Aconteceu de novo e pelo jeito nunca vai parar! Eu sou otima em foder com tudo...bom pelo menos eu sou boa em algo neh! A vida sempre me zuou mas uma coisa e certa ela nao pode me vencer. Eu sou a LIA e goste ou nao vc nao pode acabar comigo.....triste eu fiko mas nunca mais do que 2 ou 3 dias. Venho recebendo um monte de mensagens , de pessoas que nem conheço e que sao legais comigo, alguma maldosas tb ....mas e dai as que ven de gente legal compensam....Valeu! &nbsp; &nbsp;
