						   Protesters trying to get their Andy Warhol-specified 15 minutes of fame, as the Democrats annoint John Kerry, are  urlLink wailing and weeping over being kept in a single location . Apparently it's fenced (which, given the horrific security surrounding the convention as a whole, seems not much less of an inconvenience than what's being imposed on others), which they don't like, and it's too far from the Fleet Center.  This, they claim, abridges their "free speech" rights.  Yeah, you heard that right. Putting them in a single location abridges their freedom of speech. They think.  While I don't mind them speaking their minds, I need to point out that the idea here is not to silence them. It's to keep everyone safe. (Not that I think the overboard precautions are even necessary ... but the security in Boston this week will be a major headache for everyone there; conventioners, residents,  and  protesters alike; they'll hardly be the only inconvenienced folk there.)  Yes, I know freedom of speech is guaranteed in the First Amendment. But I'd like to know where in the Constitution a "right to be heard" specified?  Don't bother looking. It's not there.  If these protesters want to make a point, they should simply make it. Coercing themselves into the convention hall (which is  really  what they want to do) is not going to happen. They have to think of  alternative  ways of making an impression. And if they can't (or won't) do that, I'd have to conclude they have nothing to say worth hearing.  Lastly, pinning protesters down in certain locales has been standard practice in many large events, for a long time; since 1992 for Democratic national conventions, anyway. 12 years later these deadbrains are still harping on the same tune. Whole bunch of 'em should just grow up. "Want any cheese, with that whine?"

						   For those who are opposed to gay marriage, for whatever reason, I'd like to ask a question. It's a simple, innocent one, but its very simplicity may lead you astray. So I need to add caveats, after I ask it. And that question is:     “What is it about gay marriage, which will harm  you ?”

						   One of the things I find most annoying is that people's use of language is rapidly devolving into chaos. People don't seem to care much about pronouncing things correctly, they pay no attention to usage, many can't spell very well, they overuse jargon, and the list goes on.  No, I'm not trying to be your English teacher. And no, I'm not trying to trample on your "freedom of expression." And, I'm aware that certain uses of language are connected with social identity. I know all of that. Really!  These are, however, all just excuses for lazy speech and writing. Yes, you read that right! And it's incredibly self-defeating. You see, language is based upon social convention; it doesn't mean anything unless everyone agrees on it. Using language in a unique personal style, beyond minor differences, makes it harder for people to understand what someone is saying.  For example: If you think that paying attention to pronunciation is unnecessary, guess again. People who are hard of hearing, or who are near-deaf, can easily be confused if people don't make an effort to say things correctly. Or worse yet, what if you're interviewing for a job; if you can't, or won't, make yourself understood, you won't get it. If you want others to know what you're saying, you have to say things  correctly . Your English teacher has already told you how to do so, so rather than make excuses why you can't, just  do it !  In future entries I'll go over some specific problems. But to give you an example, people have a habit of inventing new words when old ones will do &mdash; and they do it merely to impress others (they think). Well, I never fall for it, and neither should you! The word "utilize" usually  seems  impressive, but honestly, I can't think of  anything  that one cannot "utilize," which one cannot also " use ," in two fewer syllables! The business world is full of words which are actually non-existent; everyone would be  far  better off, if people simply used ordinary, everyday speech.

						   Welcome to the all-new &ldquo;Think, For Once!&rdquo; blog. To the detriment of our society, intellectualism is rapidly dying, in the United States. Being highly educated and intellectual, isn't always welcome in our culture. Sure, people want their doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc. to be well-educated &mdash; but simply being a "thinker" isn't always acceptable. Terms such as "egghead" and "know it all" are used as pejoratives, as if being a "thinker" is somehow a terrible thing. It's a shame.  There are, of course, people who  want  things this way. The mass media, for instance, like it, since as people become less able to think for themselves, it becomes easier for them to steer people into watching certain shows, movies, etc. They turn people, quite literally, into sheep, gather them into one pen, and constantly sheer them of money. As if that weren't enough ... politicians do the very same thing, and what they do, is far worse!  And religious institutions also like this. It makes it easier for them to whip up "the faithful" and keep them clinging to notions which are often irrational. This doesn't mean that all religion is irrational ... it just means that it can be used as a "wedge in the door," by the nefarious, to steer people into irrational thinking. This allows them to control their flocks (hey, the "sheep" analogy again; how appropriate that it should come from Christian tradition!).  What's needed, of course, is for people to learn to think once more. This enables them to look at things rationally, and not fall prey to those who want to manipulate them.  You may be thinking I'm some sort of "arrogant smart guy" looking down on the less-intellectual among us. No way! I think  everyone  is capable of mental prowess sufficient to keep from being manipulated. (I'm an egalitarian; my philosophy is, if I can do it,  anyone  can do it.) It's just that most people don't know how to go about learning to think critically; it's not taught in schools, any more, and hasn't been, since about the end of World War II. Time was, courses such as Rhetoric were integral to school systems, but this disappeared. It's time this was restored to our schools ... and that's just a starting point.
