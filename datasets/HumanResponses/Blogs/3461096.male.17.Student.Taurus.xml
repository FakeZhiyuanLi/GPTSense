       The way their tears make you want to change the world so that it doesn't hurt her anymore.....Yet regardless if you love them, hate them, wish they would die or know that you would die without them ...it matters not. Because once in your life, whatever they were to the world they become everything to you. When you look them in the eyes, traveling to the depths of their souls and you say a million things without trace of a sound, you know that your own life is inevitable consumed within the rhythmic beatings of her very heart. We love them for a million reasons, No paper would do it justice. It is a thing not of the mind but of the heart.

      Yawn*...woke up early todae to see my fren swim at a countryclub competition, wanted to see if he had improvement after training in china for the hoildays. But seem to me that his speed drop but his stamina has greatly increase, i think that at china they train on lap swimming to built up stamina so sprinting wasn't that much.  Lol...after that went to play bowling and the good thing is that one of the swimmers father paid for us...said that it's his treat. Was Wondering why did he treat us? I mean like we wasn't very familiar with him, well all that comes well goes well hehe. After the competition i and my fren went to yishun shoping mall to walk and sat at starbucks to chat. Took the MRT back home at Bishan hehe my new home...i've always wanted to live at Bishan, the place there is peaceful and all my swim frens stay there...ahhhhh so great to live at a place where you can meet your frens anytime you wan.  In the evening, I was invited to a buffet dinner at parkmall with my cousins...wow the dinner was great, there were so many variety of foods and thinking of it makes me want to go back there hiaz.  Was eating like mad, had many rounds of food...lolx must be thinking that i like never ate in ages...well when if comes to buffet you must make use of the money that you spend on the food or else the money that you pay so much will be wasted, so the point of having a buffet is to eat more than what you pay hehe.  I was so full when i got back home, never ate so full before for a long time hahax...went to fren house to play com which was juz two to three blocks away...lolx thats why i said staying at a area when all your frens are staying is juz so great.

So the time we have now, we went to play pool and lan gaming than went to cineleisure to Bowl at the 9th floor, went to eat dinner at Mos Burger and went to HMV...saw alot of chio gals haha really is alot loh...it was 8.50pm already so we went for the show and was so excited and can't wait for the show to start. Dam...the show was great man , dam nice and its funny, exciting, spooky and better than the previous Harry Potter movies, dam i giv it 5 stars for this movie. i denfinetly will watch it again haha.

       They will always smell good even if its just shampoo  The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder  How cute they look when they sleep  The ease in which they fit into our arms  The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in the world  How cute they are when they eat  The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end makes it all worth while  because they are always warm even when its minus 30 out side  The way they look good no matter what they wear  The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that you think she's the most beautiful thing on this earth  How cute they are when they argue  The way her hand always finds yours  The way they smile  The way you feel when you see their name on the call ID after you just had a big fight  The way she says "lets not fight anymore" even though you know that an hour later you will be arguing about something  The way they kiss when you do something nice for them  The way they kiss you when you say "I love you'  The way they fall into your arms when they cry  Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly  The way they hit you and expect it to hurt

       She makes eye contact and smiles at you.  She calls you for homework..... a lot!!   She flips her hair when she's talking to you.   She touches your arm when she talks to you.   She says "No, I'm not telling you who I like!!" with a big smile on her face.   She asks you who you like or who you would go out with seeming interested.   When you go to the movies with a bunch of your friends, she's almost always next to you.   She criticizes (put downs) the girl you like.   She knows your WHOLE family's names including your dog).   She knows stuff about you like your birthday, eye color, favorite color, screen name, favorite food, favorite band, what music you like and favorite sport.   Her friends outside of school know about you and say she talks of you a lot.   She knows your phone number and address.   She will try and talk and spend time with you as much as possible.

The Euro Cup juz gave me a new night life, and that is watchin soccer...well before the whole soccer thing came up i was like playin console or online games or even goin out till very late...hahax until the Euro Cup came up, it was like a change to my night life lol but sad to say that the Euro Cup will be ending real soon.

Life isn't that bad when you know how to enjoy it...make every second useful and not let one single breath get wasted. Hahax haiz...goin to watch Cze vs Greece now...whose gonna win well my guess is Cze may win it, we juz have to see...
