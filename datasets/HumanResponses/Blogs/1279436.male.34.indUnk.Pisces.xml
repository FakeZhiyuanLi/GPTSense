      First the Good News: The Radicati Group estimates that 26 percent of American companies use instant messag-ing as an official corporate service and that another 44 percent would acknowledge that their employees use instant messaging on their own.

But other panelists disagreed, like Adam Dell, managing general partner of Impact Venture Funds.   Macys.com president Kent Anderson had some interesting thoughts to add, however. . . (excert lifted)  Macys.com president Kent Anderson had perhaps the most sober point of view as chief of the online division of the Macy's department store chain.   "Pay per performance ... [has] an equivalent in the real world -- commission sales people, who are your best people in the store," he said.   In a recent test, macys.com appealed to different types of affiliates based on spring and fall messages and not on price.   "We tested on affiliates and found it to be very productive," Anderson said.   That said, e-mail marketing plays a critical role in building awareness and driving online sales for macys.com. That tactic, along with the Web site, also pushes traffic to Macy's stores.

Of course, Google's not talking, at least not since my conversation with Sergey Brin. But Bosworth is, as Phil Windley noticed in his RSS Middleware post

      This from DMNews Daily. . .   FRANCE DEBUTS STICKERS TO REDUCE MAIL POLLUTION  France began a campaign last week to distribute  stickers to households warning against the pollution of  marketing letters and brochures. Environment Minister Serge  Lepeltier unveiled the "Stop pub" stickers, the French word  for advertisements. According to Agence France-Press, the  stickers say: "The abuse of brochures is dangerous for my  planet. Please spare my mailbox. No to unaddressed leaflets or  brochures, yes to communal newsletters." The stickers will be  distributed to communities and are available at energy and  environment offices. Lepeltier said letter carriers and the  direct marketing industry must abide by the stickers'  instructions. The CFDT, a union covering mail workers, said  the measure will endanger 50,000 jobs.

The Radicati Group estimates that by the end of this year there will be 362 million IM users at companies, of which only 42 million will be using enterprise-only IM systems. The other 88 percent of users will be using the public systems through 768 million accounts. The large number of accounts reflects the lack of interoperability of IM systems.  &nbsp;

      LiveMessage has captured the media's imagination and attention with a number of laudatory mentions in the past week.   First up was eWeek, which published a straightforward  urlLink piece  on July 2 that many of you may have seen.   Then came a story in India's CXOToday.com on July 9, which emphasized our RSS strategy as a way for legitimate marketers to set themselves  urlLink apart from spammers.  We've contacted them about some kinks in the story and they plan to make changes but you can get the gist in case you see it before the changes are made.   That story was picked up by Google and Yahoo News! and seems to have generated some buzz and other press inquiries.   Like the story today in ClickZ News. The piece  urlLink highlighted  our ability to harness the emerging RSS technology for marketers and help them to deliver messages on channels that people already understand.

      And more importantly, our no-SPAM message has supporters. . . Take this posting on a French website, with translation courtesy of Google.  RSS n'est pas du spam ! A voir...  RSS is not Spam! To see... On the other hand, the choice of format RSS is particularly judicious for two reasons: first of all, this format which wants to be universal is adapted to all the forms of media able to receive contents on line, computers, telephones mobile or PDA, for example. But especially, the RSS currently does not enter the techniques of Spam, and thus escapes the systems from fight anti-Spam, which makes it possible MessageCast to affirm that LiveMessage is ' No Spam '. A manner of affirming that as the firm does not use the same techniques as the spammeurs, its forwardings in mass are not Spam! Final, the adoption of RSS for the advertisements resembles a good way rather of circumventing the technological and legal restrictions which impose laws anti-Spam and the rules of diffusion of intrusive publicity, and to continue to submerge the Net surfers of not requested, but ' legal ' advertisements. posted by Yves Grandmontagne  Actual Link:  urlLink http://grandmontagne.blogspot.com/2004/07/rss-la-rvolution-sur-les-messages.html#comments
