      You slide into the seat, knocking her leg off the armrest.  She looks over at you sharply then gives a sneering smile.  "Oh, goody."  Sister Corpus, the girl's warden, comes up from where she'd been talking to the pullman.  "No Melissa, behave for Miss Jones as if it were me."  She glowers.  "I'll know."  Missy sighs.  "Yes, sister."  Corpus turns to you.  "If she gives you any trouble, just let me know...I'll deal with her on her return.  Enjoy the conference."

      That's right, only up to your full 20....  The school has been kind enough to also provide taxi fare to the train station.  You arrive at the station sunday evening and find your train on track 4.  There's a few people milling around, climbing aboard.  You get on.  The seats are arranged in 4's, two forward and two backward, with a little table in between.  You find your seat, in the second car, seat 16, which is on the aisle.  You can see a head in 15 (beside yours) as you approach.  You get closer and see a long, shapely female leg sticking out from under a Saint Ivan's skirt hung over the armrest.  As you get to the seat your worst fears are confirmed.  It's Missy Thorson in seat 15.  She's staring out the window chewing on gum and hasn't seen you yet.

      The train ticket is for a round trip from New Paris, Mass to Sharpe's Lane, Mass, leaving Sunday evening, 7pm from the New Paris central station.  The Conference is at the Sharpe's Lane Convention Centre and Hotel in downtown Sharpe's Lane.  The town is the county seat of Prince Rupert county and has historical roots reaching back to the original 13 colonies, having been created by charter of King Charles I in 1640.  The conference sessions themselves look eye-glazingly boring, and you notice that there are two tracks listed, a "teacher" track and a "student" track.

      Sister Sequilous shows up the next day with a small packet for you.  It's got the conference registration, hotel registration and a train ticket.  "I hope you have a nice time at the conference," she says, and gives you a bit of a mysterious smile as she leaves.

      Okay - I have to clear something up. Regarding MS. Anderson and the whole deal with her injuries and all.  Well... Jack Stone was a demon and Miss Anderson was in an altercation with him while I was in the chapel trying to get a bottle of really old brandy that would basically have started Armageddon if it had been drunk by the students, or whomever imbibed it.

      "Oooooo, field trip!  That could be fun."  (yup that's him) "Yeah, you can usually trust him....well as much as any superior.  And no, no hint.  Just handed it over and said 'you might find this useful'.  I mean WTF?  Can't these guys just tell you something outright?"  *rolls eyes*  "Well, I'm gonna go get ready for class.  See ya later...."  So is there anything you'd like to do in the week between now and the conference (aside from heal and recover essence, that is?)

      Didn't he give you any hints on what it could be for? Not to be mean or anything, but can you actually trust Asmodeus (OC: that is the right dude isn't it?)

      "Aw, well."  She holds up her wrist.  "Look I got a present from my boss too."  There's a spiffy watch on her wrist.  "I haven't the faint foggiest what it does, but it must be something decent right?  Otherwise, why give it to me?  What'd Sister Holier-than-thou want anyway?"

      The shoulder bag is just that.  Its style is exactly *you* and it makes you feel warm to see.  You also notice that it seems to have a very similar interior volume as the suitcase.  The journal, when you open it, is filled with blank pages.  Just the sort of thing to write you thoughts and ideas onto.  It comes with a lovely crystal pen inside too.

      "What? Oh, that....oh, very odd...You and Miss Anderson it seems.  Fighting here on campus with a wolf, who was with Ms. Trent for some reason.  Very odd dream.  Oh, Ms. Trent has injured herself, gone to hospital it seems.  She tripped while jogging, did some major damage to her leg...impaled on something or something.  She'll be back when she's healed, they told me."

      "Excellent! Thank you very much!  I'll see to it you get all the information about the conference and such."  She pauses, cocks her head at you.  "I had the strangest dream concerning you....ah well....dreams..."  And she goes, closing the door behind her.

(you can hear the capital letters as she speaks)  "All classes are suspended and the students spend the week in special education, related to the feast.  But....next week also coincides with the Annual Special Conference on Continuing Seperate Education, and Saint Ivan's School always sends a deligate, usually one of the junior faculty members."

      You split the wrapping and discover inside....a funky new shoulder bag!  It's exactly the style you'd love.  Inside the bag is a leather-bound journal tied closed with a rawhide thong.  There is a knock at the door.

      You slide casually back into your dorm room.  It's still fairly early in the morning, classes haven't started yet.  Your room is just how you left it.  Flipping open the suitcase, you see a wrapped present, in happy red and silver paper with a bright, shiny bow on top.  The card on top says (in bold, masculine hand) "Far more convenient, I think! - L."

      "One thing."  He holds up a plastic cricket.  "For when you really  really  need me."  He squeezes it and it makes a *click* sound.  "One click," he says, "is answered by two clicks."  He squeezes it again. *click*click*  "Click once, and I'll answer.  Please, use it sparingly."  He hands it to you.  "Be careful.

      He smiles at you gently.  "Cody....let me tell you a few 'open secrets' okay?  "In this war, you do what you have to...and that's exactly what you did here.  What needed to be done.  Sure, it'd be nice to say we never hurt the mortals, but when they're on the side of evil, sometimes we have to.  It happens.  Don't beat yourself up about it too badly.  "And as to what was going on here....well, there was lots of activity.  Did you know that Blandane herself was out in the Marches?  She was.  I saw it.  Beleth too, if what I heard is right.  And while you were saving the world that way there were two dozen other angels doing the same thing in different fights different places.  You aren't the only agent of Heaven, you realize."  He smiles again.  "Yes, I realize that your partner is diabolical.  But there are very few who would take such a distinction personally.  Blandane is a political neophite.  She doesn't  understand.  In the end, really, we're all angels...some are just flipsides of the others.  Even Dominic (Judgement) understands that."  "As to the humans...mortals have a surprising way of picking themselves up from reality and carrying on as before.  YOu'll be amazed!  The truth is always the truth, and it will always set you free.  Don't worry, you did well.  Trust yourself."

      Nicely done? Nicely done? **annoyed as all get out ** I ordered a demon to shoot a teacher and a student - I kicked a mortal in the head - or didn't you hear the crash in the symphony? -  I am so wiped out by trying to stop my allies from getting their asses kicked because we were seriously outnumbered most of the time... caught the attention of one of the scariest evil Gods - luckily placated him for the time being - because no-one on this side of the game offered any assitance and Blandane doubted my trustworthiness because the only thing willing to help me out was a demon who had originally wanted to kick my ass and shit down my throat to quote her.... and to top it off I picked up a note of dissonance because I skirted the truth - which I intend to fix, but the truth is so UNBELIEVABLE that I'll probably get my teaching job  taken away and sent to the Aberdeen Home for the Insane....and there is no way I want to be caged with those blood suckers.   Now there's a huge mess and if Ms. Trent blabs how the hell do I explain why Miss. Anderson shot her on MY ORDERS? Again it's another situation where the truth is unbelievable and if I skirt the big issues again I'll probably end up falling.  (Pick up a rock and chuck it into the ocean) *huff*

      "'K"  She goes, and Missy follows her.    Elizabeth comes over to you, she's got some scratches, but not too bad. "So, did we save the world again?"  She motions toward the trio on the ground.  "What can we do with them?"

      (how very non-destructive of you)  You hear a crash of the symphony as your foot connects with her head, but it's enough to send her sprawling.  The machine shuts down with a quiet *boop*. (perhaps the blue screen of death would be more appropriate?  would this be a windows app?  :-)  The world spins, swirls, shakes, draws inward then spews out again.  Ace lies on his back, unconcious, on the roof.  Carol and Owen are unconcious and bleeding.  Amber, you and Elizabeth are the only ones awake.  Raven, Wolf, the warriors and the village are gone.

      You swing at the bird and give a glancing blow, keeping it off balance.  Amber tosses the computer.  It bounces off the A/C and skids across the gravel.  But it's a Dell and keeps working.

      She takes another shot.  This time Owen goes down.  "That oughta help."  Wolf leaps at Elizabeth, tackling her, as Raven dives at you.  You take two points damage from it's claws.  You see Amber stand up, holding a small black-cased notebook.  The screen is swirling with shapes and figures.

      "Lil' bastard, goin' down!"  She flashes off another shot but it's wide.  "Damn!"  The warriors all pause, scratching their heads and looking confused.  Wolf and Raven, however, are still coming.  Amber is crouching down doing something on the ground, but you can't see what.

      She grins.  "With  pleasure ."  She aims and squeezes off a shot, spinning Carol Trent around.  The comp-sci teacher drops to the gravel.  All heads snap around in your direction.  "Get them!" snarls the Wolf.  Raven takes to the air and Owen rushes forward to continue whatever Carol had been doing.  On top of the warriors before you coming at you, you can hear the ones from behind coming foward too.  Across the roof you see Amber sneaking forward, unnoticed.  To do what, you can't tell.

      A *lot* of dust.  Some large power generation equipment, all of which is silent and stopped.  It doesnt' look like anyone's been here in ages.  Hax appears in the door, with Missy behind him.  "Hmmmm, not too much power generation going on here is there?"  A metal walkway is suspended about 25 feet above the floor.  A stairway at the wall leads up to it.  In the back of the room, you can see on the upper floor a sort of control room type thingy overlooking teh main floor.  Under that are doors that appear to go into some other part of the building.

      You follow the road up.  As you reach the top the sun does as well, cresting the hill.  (restore 1 point of spent essence).  The road and the trees end at the same point, about 20 feet from the building.  Across the way you can see teh building sits dark and quiet.  There are no cars about.  A single green door is on this end of teh building, beneath a large arched window of smoked glass.

      You head out from the hotel, a small knot of celestials out to do good (or evil) as their natures demand.  You make your way quickly over to River and down the way to where 1024 would be.  As you get closer, you can see a large and somewhat sinister looking power plant lurking darkly on an embankment over the river.  Power lines run out of the plant in all directions like a steel spiderweb.  As the city starts to peter out you reach a gated area with a sign.  The gate hangs open, and the sign reads "Electrimass, 1024 River Street".  A rusted sign on the fence reads "Keep Out, No Tresspass."  A gravel drive winds up toward the plant building, lined on either side by tall trees and bushes in a very wild state.  It's just before dawn.

      Without a word she swims over to the edge closest to the door and climbs out, then stands in profile while wringing out her hair.   She gives you an evil smile.  "They weren't gonna do anything anyway..."  She quickly towels off and pulls on her "Lil' Devil" t-shirt and low-rise jeans.  As you re-enter the hotel she drops her underwear into the hands of one of the guys still standing there.  "A little souvineer," she says with a wink.  You cross the lobby to a quiet area.  "So what's up?  And who's--this? (looking at Robin)?"

      "Um, uh, um..."  They all start to look even more embarassed.  A few start drifting away, suddenly having thought of other things they had to do.  As they depart you get a look through the window.  Outside, pathway lights are on around the pool, as is the light in the pool itself.  A small pile of clothing sits at the water's edge across from the door and in the pool, naked as the day she was never born, is Missy, swiming and making an obvious spectale of herself, while pretending not to notice anyone.

      As you approach you overhear them talking.    "Is that legal?"   "What do you think, moron?"  "Man, that's hot!"  As you speak, they all jump, startled, and spin around.  They are obviously tryign to block the view out the door iwth their bodies.  They all look sheepish, as if caught, a couple blush.  One, seemingly a bit more mature than the rest, clears his throat.  "Um, yes, um, m'am, what can I do for, um, you?"

In fact, I'd say that my thing is now secondary to yours..."  Robin nods.  "See?  If it wasn't Hax here, you'd have gotten roped in somehow.  Trust me, it's the way fate and destiny works."  You reach the hotel and enter the lobby.  It's quiet (middle of the night) and there's few staff about.  One woman on desk (looking grumpy), and at the back of the lobby, there are about five guys all looking out through the glass back door toward the pool.

      Robin starts cleaning out the pipe with a pen knife while talking.  "Well, Hamish tends to make a bit of a nusance of himself with anything going on in this part of the world, so *shrug* you deal with him when you have to..."  Robin taps the pipe on a palm and shakes loose black grit from the bowl.  "And why you?  You're one of the souls involved, that's why."  "So why not me?" Hax asks.  Robin shrugs again.  "Maybe you're not as involved as you think you are..."

      Okay.... but..... how is it that I am involved in all this... I mean it would make more sense that this scalar thing is after Hax than me.... and isn't the issues of fate well... kind of up to the souls involved - how can anyone else affect that?

But that's nevermind."    She pulls the pipe out of her pocket and fidgets with it.  "As to that thing...the scalar manifestation is what we call it....it's a physical representation of an entwined destiny unfulfilled.  Things like that will appear to those touched by the thread.  If we can resolve the issues of fate, then we can make it disappear too."

      Hax thinks a second, looking more than a little boggled.  "Um, yup, that seems to fill it out pretty well."  Robin considers everything, looking surprisingly non-plussed.  "Yeah, I can see why I'm here.  C'mon, let's go find your succubus, and I'll try to explain."  You start walking in the direction of the hotel.  "Y'see," Robin starts, "I used to work for Yves.  But I did so well, *derisive snort* I got my own word.  I'm not an archangel...thank goodness, but I'm also not a servitor anymore either.  Guess I'm Heaven's middle managment...anyway....my word is actually two words....*destiny entwined*.

      You start back toward the hotel.  As you go past a small park shortly before the conference complex begins, you see a 20-ish woman (man?) leaning on a tree, smoking a pipe.  She(?) is dressed in white t-shirt and black jeans, with high doc martin boots and a long vinyl-looking trench coat.  Her(?) hair is short and spiky, colored the most natural looking green you've ever seen.    She nods at you as you come up.  "Mind if I tag along?"

      "Hang on...lemme check."  Reaching into the rubble he pulls out a Yellow Pages and riffles through until he finds the listing.  "Uh, 1024 South River Street.  I think that's this side of the bridge, but near the outskirts of town.  You going alone or do you want to dig up the succubus and we'll all go together?"

      Um... I am not entirely certain that I was really talking to Liz. I think it was her, but she was not at all specific on how and where she got the information.  It was also expressed that I have to be the one to go get him.

      Well my past dealings with her have shown her to be reliable, although she is a demon, so I have to take her at her word until she proves otherwise.  So where does this leave us - other than at another dead end?

      He shakes his head sadly.  "Nope, not a hope in--well, not a hope anyway.  But I honestly dont' think Adara or Zara knows that.  All of their documentation is quite earnest.  They believe it totally."  He thinks a seocnd.  "So can we trust your demon friend to tell us the truth?"

      Hax looks concerned.  "Wonder where he's ended up?"  Jean takes over Hax's attention.  "Keep on this.  I want a solution.  If someone's interfering with mortal scientists, we need to know aobut it.  Too much information is as bad a too little.  Cody has agreed to continue helping you.  I'm going to go and check with Yves.  Now that I know where you are, I'll come back to see you shortly."  He turns to you.  "Good luck, call if you need me."

      "What I mean by politics is, if he's fooled mortals into thinking it works, they may want it destroyed so that it won't compete with them, little knowing that there's no way it can.  Y'know?  As to the creature...that I jsut don't know.  Could you phone calls be on the net but somehow untracable?"  Jean explains how you both saw the creature on the bridge.  Hax is surprised.  "Really?  It came to see you?"  "Yes, and it seemed incredibly focused on Cody.  I must talk to YVes about this.  What does your research of the disk say?"  "Looks to me like a non-starter, boss.  But I do get the impression that Doctor Tom doesn't even realize his machine doesn't work...."

      Huh? I don't think Hax is aware of the history..... [tell him what I found out, but not how]  So what does this thing do that could trick people? and what mortal politics. I am not seeing direct connections at all, and what about that creature thing that is attracted to me for some reason - how does that fit in?

      Jean holds up an obviously 'super-duper' ethereal palmtop.  "Here, use mine."  Hax takes it and quickly starts scanning the disk.  Jean turns to you.  "Do you see any connection between this and the historical issues you've discovered?  Could all of this just be a ruse of some sort?"  Hax looks up quickly from the computer.  "Or could it all be just mortal politics?  It took me some doing to figure out this thing didn't work.  It might fool mortals...especially ones not fully versed in physics, electronics and unified field theory."

      Jean hustles you along, going exactly where you need to get to.  He knew all along, he was just letting you lead...  You get there and find Hax in the demolished lab.  He spins around as you enter.  "Hax, we need to talk...."  Hax is obviously nervous.  "Oh, hey, boss, um, I ws gonna call....um, listen, I've got news here."  Jean is unimpressed.  "Oh, you do, do you?"  Hax nods.  "Yeah, yeah, I do.  Y'see this?"  He indicates a machine on the bench.  You recognize it from teh video and the dumpster.  He's taken it and rebuilt it.  "It's a total load of crap.  Never could, never would do anything but hold a paper down in a strong wind..."

      "Okay, okay," she takes a deep breath.  "I mean, Tom's a great guy and all, and I mean, he's really nice and stuff, but he and I?  Um, well, I dunno.....That's a good idea though, I'll go and start calling people.  Are you sure he'll be okay?  Call me when ever you hear anything, I mean anything!  Okay?"  She looks around.  "Max!  Max!  Where'd the damned dog go...."  She starts off after the pooch.  Jean smiles at you.  "Nicely done.  Now let us find my errant servant."  He whisks you off across the bridge.  Are you planning on just following him straight to the lab?

      "Yes sir"  Walk over to Zara - okay I get the distinct impression from your incredibly deep concern for Tom that you and he are a little more than just co-workers. You've already been through enough trauma. Go get your dog.... go home and phone as many people as you can think of in the area that might have an idea of where Tom could have gone if he got away from  these people.   Since that *thing* is attracted to me.... I would rather you stay out of danger and not come with me and Jean (nod to Jean). If there's going to be trouble because of it - I'd rather you be safe.   We're going to wander by the dumpsters.... and track down Hax which could take awhile.  Call me on my cell (give number again) if you need me.

      He speaks low and quietly so no one else can hear.  "He's at the laboritory.  Deal with the human, but see to it that she stays here.  I want to be able to speak to you both openly."

      "No sign of Tom??" She becomes quite upset.  "What's happened to him??"  Jean: "Yves will find that creature quite interesting, I should hting.  He may have some idea of who or what or why it is and where it may be from.  Quickly now, we must speak to Hax."

      Zara is absolutely speechless.  Max is long long gone.  Jean turns back to you with a totally blank expression.  "I don't know, and it's not telling.  I have to tell Yves about this."  From behind you, you hear an electronic version of the Batman theme.  You turn, and Zara looks shocked, until she realizes it's her phone.  She answers then goes a bit pale, before holding the phone out to you.  "It's for you...again."

      He starts forward, slowly but intently, approaching it.  He holds out his hands toward it but the thing appears to take no notice of him.  As it hits the end of the bridge, it looks at you, and you get the uncomfortable feeling that it's looking straight through you.  Zara has dropped Max's leash and the animal has hightailed it for home.  After a second, the thign shoots skyward at great speed, until it's just a red dot in among the stars.  Jean turns back to you.  "Well, that was quite odd."

      He laughs, very hard.  Even some of the others at the table chuckle.  Finally when he's done whiping his ghostly eyes.... "Oh, well done!  Well done indeed!  Why if we were both alive...."  Takes a deep breath.  "Anyway,  mostly the dark arts are those knowledges not mean to be known by humans."  He turns a pointed eye toward Missy.  "In my day they said it was the devil's doing.  That dark creatures would come and whisper in the ears of humans....."  He trails off.    Then, directly to Missy "Do I know you?"  "I'm just a student at Saint Ivan's school. I don't see how we could have met before."  Smiles sweetly.

      "It's true, Tom," Zara says.  He thinks about it for a further few minutes, with no one saying anything.  Finally he looks up at you.

      I told you that it got weird, but please sir explain why Hax is driving that van, and why would your own lab tech lie about being taken hostage to a run down, abandoned electrical plant? I know this defies logic and reason - trust me when I say it makes me uncomfortbale too, but Zara can confirm that the guys who took her hostage said that they took their orders directly from Samantha Paxhill.

      [gotcha]  He sits very quitely listening.  Zara fills him in quite fully on the events at the lab.  Hax helps out the best he can.  Missy just tosses off jokes.  Liz tells her part quite honestly.  Robin says nothing.  At the end he raises a finger.  "Cheque please.  This is just crazy.  I'm supposed to believe that Samantha Paxhill is out to distroy my research and possibly kill me and that there's a red-eyed bugaboo running around?  I'm sorry but my imagination isnt' that good."  "But Tom," Zara says, "I've seen it.  Cody saw it, her friend Jean saw it..."  "And my work...the lab..."  "You can recover, don't worry," Hax says.  "But I'm most worried about this Paxhill lady."

      You settle in to a large booth with a couple of chairs pulled up to the outside.    The waitress (a different one from the overnight shift) comes up to take your order.  Liz just gets coffee, as does Hax.  Missy wants a cherry coke and a very complicated hamburger order, Tom gets breakfast, Zara just has water.

      Missy smiles.  "We can all get cosy...."  Liz tosses down the tire iron.  "Screw the rental."  You all pile back into the van.  It's pretty close, but you've still got room for Tom's luggage.  Hax drives back into town.  The traffic's fairly light, being a monday morning, mid-morning.  The ride is quiet, with no one really talking.  Hax finally pulls up in the parking lot of a diner.  It's George's...again.

      Emotionally, Tom is a confused mess.  He's overwealmed right now.  He doesn't understand who anyone is, why he is where he is and why on earth Zara is hugging him like he's her long lost lover.  He's also more than a little frightened.

      Missy gets a sneering smile on her face.  "Oh goody.  Miss Anderson."  She hauls out a tire and rolls it around to the side of the car.  "Damn rental car....I couldn't take it....all this feast stuff was driving me nuts.  I thought you might need a hand so I got a car and came up.  Ran into this one on the way...he'd rolled into the ditch."  Zara looks at Tom shocked.  Tom's still looking strangely at Zara.  "Um, yeah.  I got this phone call and as I was getting off the line, some animal jumped out in front of the car....I was lucky I just went in the ditch...."

      He pulls the van off the road and Zara is out the door in an instant.  She runs up and throws her arms around Tom.    "TOm!  Oh thank god you're safe!"  At the word God, a head pops up over the trunk lid.  It's Liz.

      "Gotcha chief."  Hax turns the van toward the on ramp and hits the highway.  He drives for a good half hour and there's no sign of anything untoward.  Then, in the distance, you all spot a car pulled off to the side of the road.  It's a little red two door, tilted up at a funny angle.  There's a jack under the back wheel, the trunk's open and you can see a man standing at the side of the road near the car.  Zara's eye open wide.  "Tom!"

      You pile into the van and with a madman's grin, Hax makes it start, though there's no key.  As you peal out you see the mercenaries standing in the door.  One even waves as you go.  The wheels hit the pavement and Hax turns toward town.  "Where to now boss?"

      Her eyes go wide as she's grabbed by someone she didn't see, her eyes not having adjusted to the dark yet.  The guy leading her from outside gives a "hey!" and charges in, but also stands blinking in the dark, trying to adjust his eyes.  You've got an advantage for the second.

      The boots crunch toward the door.  As they do, the thing drifts off to the side, diming in strength until you almost can't see it.  The door opens and you see Zara pushed in roughly.  "Get her inside.  We'll hold her in the control room."

      You don't really find anything else of interest.  But as you make your way back into the main generating room, you see a red glow emerge from the gloom.  It grows brighter and stronger until you can make out that it is the eyes of the dark thing, though in the dim light you can't see the body.  It stands there, between you and the exit, just staring.

      You're not talking about the Beleth incident are you?  *sheepish grin* So why is Litheroy so scared of you then? You seem reasonable and all, and you run a very nice place. I understand "your word is law" and stuff, and I am certain I wouldn't want to get on your bad side.... but I believe it was implied - if not specifically stated that I should avoid you. I don't really want a demonstration of you power - and explanation would certainly suffice. *smile*

I mean if Litheroy realy wanted me out of here - I would have left... not happily but I would have.

He turns his head to Missy, who's still on her knees beside the quickly fading Samantha.  "This one is a trouble maker.  She was the last time through as well, but she keeps returning.  Not so much a trouble maker though to be rejected."

      You hear the heavy crunch of shoes and look over as a large police officer in uniform approaches.  Robin gives him a smile.  "Hey Hamish, I wondered when you'd show up."  He nods to her. "Robin."  His hands open to encompass the group of you.  "Are you all done here, in my place?"  Robin looks over at you.  "Yeah, pretty much I think.  You think Cody?

      "You know the way human courts work...firearm use in the commission of another felony, in this case kidnapping...No I think he's pretty much doomed.  But look at him, he doesn't want it to be any different."  You look over and see Tom.  Liz and Hax still have him pinioned to the table, but all of his fight is gone.  He's staring at Samantha with tears and an agonized expression on his face.  "No, not this way, no that's not how it was supposed to go...."  Samantha, meanwhile, is in obviously bad shape.  Zara and Missy are doign what they can but it's not much.  "Karmic revenge is a funny thing isn't it?" Robin asks.

      Robin pulls the pipe out and begins loading it.  "No, not really.  Mostly I come to these things to make sure that not too many of the wrong people get injured or killed."  Outside the bug-eyed creature begins to dissolve.  "Had a real disaster on my hands back in '63, in Point Plesant, Ohio.  That one went really really wrong."  Lights the pipe.  "This one...well, you know that this state has the death penalty, right?"

      Oh he's there alright.  Closer to the window, staring in at you.  What you hear in your mind is "History, repeats."  The restaurant is in chaos. Patrons and staff make for the door. Liz slams Tom down onto the table, wresting the gun from his hand with Hax helping.  Missy is up and going past you toward where Samantha is. Only Robin is sitting calmly and serenly at the table.  Somewhere in the fog of background noise, you hear "She's been shot!"

      He swings the gun up toward you.  As he does, Liz makes her move grabbing for the pistol.  You start your song of Harmony.  The gun goes off as Liz gets her hand on him, thrusting his arm up toward the ceiling.  The few other patrons and staff of the restaurant look, some diving for cover, others letting out a scream.  You see Samantha Paxhill crumple to the ground.

Okay Tom - how about this.... there really is no way that you are leaving here with Zara, and if my guess is correct you have a choice - you can rationally put the gun down and start talking OR it will be taken from you. I give you 10 seconds to make your choice... (If he does not put the gun down I will spend 1 more point of Essence on Harmony the sluggish kind)

You'd think it was the money, wouldn't you?  But it's not.  Not by a long shot."  You can see that Liz is trying to judge what she can do to get the gun away from him.

      Some songs will operate "ethereally" on a target or "celestially", but what that means, I think, is that it hits them in their ethereal or celestial abilites.  But other songs (like the dream ones) will only work on the ethereal or celestial plane.  So, yes, you can ethereally zap Tom.  You succeed, btw.  You've got 3 minutes of rational thought.  He doesn't lower the gun, though.  "No it didn't have to be this way.  But it is now.  You interfeared.  You stuck your nose in and you shouldn't have.  And now we're leaving."  He starts to get up from his seat, trying to get Zara to come up with him.

      He looks up at you with a smile, not embarassed any more.  His look is dark, malevelant.  "Because I needed someone to blame. Someone to take the fall for my broken experiments, my failed research."  He pulls a small pistol from his pocket.  "I don't know who or what you people are but I'm pretty sure that you'll bleed and die just like us."  He jams the barrel into Zara's side.  "And I know she will.

Why would I want to do anything to the man who's going to bring my company back from the brink of destruction?"  She points across the table.

      A mysterty that needs solving - is a secret to be exposed (now where's my cape?) I'll give it a go.... I have no idea *if* I'll be able to find him. What about the school though won't they be expecting me back? and... do you have a hint at where I could start looking? I like mysteries, but mysteries with no real clues..... that's um....   almost   impossible...

      "He was in the company of a group....they were headed to New England to found a charity hospital, seminary and public school.  It was a mixed order known as the Order of the Stary Cross."  The book is now, somehow, sitting open in his lap, dispite the fact that Yves never stood up and you never saw the book move.  "Yes, here it is....Order of the Stary Cross.  Left Ireland aboard the clipper  Redepmtive  in June, 1868.  No record of it having arrived in America.  In fact, that's where the record ends."  He shows you the book.  The text stops half way down the page and the remainder of the sheet is blank.  "Do you think you can find him Cody?"  (um, btw...this might be an appropriate time to pass on character points to finish off from last time....you've earned another -- say 5 points...added to the 6 you got earlier, we can make a total of 11.

      "Ah, yes, the sad case of Uriel.  He'd been an archangel....but he was perhaps a bit overly zealous in the execution of his duties...slew all the creatures of myth.  Dragons, everything.  He was -- recalled -- in 700 and some odd."  He thinks for a few minutes.  "No, I can honestly say that I can recall no times when one of those recalled was not recorded immediately.  And there have been very few of those even."  "The sad truth is, Saint Ivan has disappeared!"

      Yves gives you a bit of an indulgant smile.  "No not Ivan he....  Him  he...."  Yves looks up toward the ceiling.  "Though usually the only time someone disappears like that is because they've been recalled to the higher realms, higher than this one I mean.  And if that happens, we usually have a record of it.  I mean, look at Uriel."

      "His ship was departing to somewhere on the east coast.  He's not supposed to be able to vanish like that.  I mean, yes,  He  could do it I guess, but  He  doesn't.  The heart will only find him for us if he comes back to Heaven.  We've tried to find him with it as a beacon, but it's taken us nowhere.  Some strong forces must be a work to do this, but we don't even know really what we're up against."  He smiles at you.  "Not like that's a new thing for you though is it?"

How does something just get erased like that? and if you know wher is heart is why can't you find him with that? Wouldn't his heart be kinda like a homing device to find him?

      He actually looks a bit embarassed as he takes another sip of his tea.  "*Ahem*, um, well, yes.  Yes, we're supposed to know where they are."  He nods over at the bookshelf and you can see a big olive green bound book.  "They're  supposed  to all be in there, but um, Ivan's missing.  It covers his departure from Ireland to America and then....."  He opens his hands. "Nothing.  It's like he was erased from history."  "And in answer to your other question....no, celestials aren't supposed to disappear like that.  Unless you are truly killed and your heart is broken.  And Ivan's heart is still strong and whole."

      Okay - so you're saying that um... saints don't come with homing devices. It is posisble for us to lose someone then? Isn't there some big directory book that lists where everyone is at any given moment that could be referred to? How do you lose a saint? Can celestials be lost like that?

      You make your way back to Yves' library.  This time, you go in through the door and inside is a very small room, no larger than a bedroom, with a single small wicker bookshelf against the wall.  The usual two chairs are set up with the small table between.  A steaming cup of tea sits at his elbow, and an obviuosly cold bottle of coke sits by teh empty chair.  "Cody, c'mon in, have a seat.  I knew you'd be by...."

You've got me curious...and you know what that means."  He turns back to the box.  "Are you a dragon?"  The creature looks up at him with an almost-smile and lets out a puff of flame that singes Litheroy's nose.  He leaps back with a yelp and you can't help but giggle.

      "Sure..."  You whisk back to earth.  You're in the desert.  It's very very warm and the sun's barely crested the horizon.  It's an archaeological dig site of some sort, with white tents and folding furniture everywhere.  You see Litheroy looking into a small pen.  You wander over and look into the pen yourself.  Inside is what looks like a tiny dinosaur.  Something like a cross between a tricerotops and a stegasaur.  "Now, I ask you," Litheroy asks, "does that look like a dragon to you?"

      You land on your beach.  It's empty but for your heart.  Heading to the Litheroy's Library, you find a few other celestials but no Litheroy.  "Oh, looking for the chief?  He's gone to Mongolia...apparently someon's found a real live dragon, or so they claim...he's gone to see if it's real."

      There is much milling about and pointing of fingers at the restaurant.  Hax and Missy stand nearby, Hax trying to appear nonchalant, Missy trying to chat up a cop.  Zara is still inside, talking to the police.  Beneath a tree across the road, ignoring the action and the crowds, Robin holds on to the pipe bowl and watches the smoke rise out of it.  The majority of the crowd is whispering (and not so whispering): "So what happened?"   "...heard Samatha Paxhill was shot..." "...know who did it?" "I heard a gang of robbers." "Really, I wonder if it was a corporate hit..." "Man, I'm not gettin' coffee today!" "Saint Oswin, we ask in thy name, the protection of our fallen sister..."

And now I'm stuck with this whole lost opportunites thing.  I really feel like things should've been different, like we missed out on something, something that would have been really wonderful.  It's depressing.  I then spent the trip back to the office with a driver talking about his dead father....wonderful.  That just made the afternoon.....

It's not like I'm worrying about anything real....like what I have to pay my ex-wife, or how my kid's going to grow up or where my next meal is coming from or anything.  Just what size of toys I want.  Why does writing this thing always make me melancholy?  Am I just so used to *drama* in these things that it doesn't feel right unless there is some?

      Feeling better today.  I often wonder why people say and do the things they do.  Why does stuff come up when it does?  And why does it seem to come up at the strangest of times?  Just makes me wonder really.  I mean, if I were to be having the discussion I've been having with someone over the past few days, because of something tangable that I could tell where it came from, I'd feel a lot better.  I'd have something I could point to and say "Huh, there, that's what caused this" but I can't.  Lemme get a little more detailed here.  I've been dancing about with someone very dear to me about the fact that we've got something special, and that we should have more than we do, but don't and when will fate ever decide to let us get on with what we want to get on with?  But I have no idea  why  we're having this discussion.  I have no clue where it came from.  None.  In other news...my son isn't sleeping.  Which, of course, means that my wife and I aren't sleeping either.  But, she's so paranoid about me and what I do when she's asleep, she refuses to go to be without me!  I mean, talk about trust issues!  Okay, now reading that in light of the paragraphs above....I mean, that person and I aren't going to do anything about things.  It's not like we're about to leave our families and shack up.  Heaven knows, if she'd wanted that she coulda had it when I left my first wife, but she blew her chance there.  Which brings me back to being confused.  All will become clear, I guess...someday....

      Okay, start of a new week, right?  So, of course, I've got a bitch of a headache that's trying to develop into a migrane.  I haven't seen those flashing lights in a dog's age, so where the heck is it coming from now? Well, wherever it's from it can just scoot right back there.  Had a very nice weekend.  Valantines day spent with the wife and child.  I went the macho route and bought her underwear.  It actually went over far better than I ever expected.  I even got credit for paying a fortune, when I really didn't!  She didn't buy me anything, but I got my present back in service....  ;-)  Even my dad was out for V's with my step-mom!  Now that's something...getting him out of the house!  Work sucks, but that't to be expected, I think.  I have the best fun playing an In Nomine RPG with my best friend (in the whole wide word), rather than doing work.  Then again, it's not that onerous here.  Okay, that's enough for now...back to work and psuedo-work while waiting to see if my head'll explode....

      I came to a realization on thursday (or was it wednesday) heading home from work.  She, that is the woman who I feel I should be with, the one who I'm truly in love with and feel is my soul-mate...her, well, she's giving me all that she can...all that she's prepared to right now.  And for that I am extremely grateful.  I cherish everything we have and do together, and for now that's got to be enough.  I've got my family, she has hers.  If some day we can be a family together, that's wonderful too, but until then, I take all she can give and give all that I can.  And that, is a relationship.  What a weight off that was to learn!  *Whew*  I can breathe again.  I can relax again.  I can understand and live a life and not be tormented.  What caused this?  Where did this revelation come from?  I have no idea.  I'm just glad it showed up.  :-)

      I'm tired as hell and sick of not having a life.  I feel like I never have the opportunity to do anything for myself anymore.  It's always somthing for my wife, something for my son, never anything for me.  I read in my horoscope this week that I'll be "getting rid of something I no longer need".  I fear that this means any sort of life or personal interests I ever had.  *sigh*  And I just wish I could have a decent night's sleep!  I keep having these royally screwed up dreams.  I have no clue where they came from or why I'm having them, but they just keep me from having a decent sleep!  By the time I drag my ass home at night I'm just about ready to nod off at the wheel....  Now it's home for another weekend of slaving to the family.  Well, only 20 years until my son's old enough to be out on his own...maybe then I'll have a chance to breathe for myself.

      I'm an Angel! LOL    Incarnated Angel  An exquisite spiritual being you are. The world is starved of love and kindness, and it turns forlornly on a rusty axel forged by man's treachery and greed. Your assignment here on Earth is to teach the values of true, unconditional love and to reach out to those with no-one else to turn to. Your heart is immeasurable in its compassion and pain for the human race. Everywhere you see death and poverty, evil and despair, and your Angel heart feels at the point of breaking. You're so willing to love and blossom in the love of another, but beware. There are those who will wrecklessly play with your fragile emotions and take advantage of you. Don't let them. Surround yourself with people you know you can completely trust, and let your inner light shine.    urlLink   Which Earth Angel Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      How much do you love your life?  Last night (well yesterday in general) I was having a pretty good day, and then I hit that question.  It's a good one.  I went from "well, sure it's okay, but do I really love it?" to "what is love of life anyway?".  I eventually worked out a scale.  0 - I wish I'd never been born. 1 - Put a pillow over my face and get it over with ... 3 - It's okay, but I've *got* to make some changes ... 6 - It's generally better than worse. ... 8 - I think there are some general changes I'd like to make but other than that, smooth sailing! 9 - I'm happier that a clam at high tide. 10 - I'd carve out an eye just to keep breathing.  So I figured out I was at about a 6 myself yesterday, mabye even a 7.  Then I got home and got ambushed by the wife.  I dropped to a 0 so fast it would make your head spin!  Even today I'm still only at a 2 or a 3.  Add to this the fact that I've got another migraine....I have a feeling this sliding scale will come in very handy!  On other news, I had a realization on the bus yesterday.  She is the only person I've ever met who I can fall in love with (and I mean mad passionate obsessive love) over and over again on a regular basis.  I'm on my second wife here and a few girlfriends, and never before have I expeienced this.  I've heard it's not even possible.  But it is....

      Status....migraine.  Woke up with a real bugger this morning and it's hung on all day too.  Yaay.  I have a feeling it's going to keep lasting too, like into tomorrow and even the next day.  *sigh*  But I content myself that I'm not as bad as my best friend, who regularly runs 10+ migraines in her cute little head.  I don't know if I could deal with that.  Had an interesting dream last night.  She, the one who I truely love, handed me a box of crystals.  She's big into crystals.  Well, turns out that the crystals she handed me are good for healing, delving into past lives (which I've dwelt on a lot lately) and also issues of love.  The whole thing really adds up to a divinitory meaning of "wait, take time, learn lessons and it will come, enduring love will last".    It all adds up in my mind to the answer to a question I've been asking myself a lot lately.  Could we, She and I, have been brought back together in this life only to be kept apart?  I like to think no, but I've not been sure.  Until now.  Now I have this dream, and it answers my questions for me.  Perhaps it just wish fulfillment, but how could I dream things that I don't know about?  I'm good, but I'm not that good.  It gives me some peace and contentment to know this.  I followed it on with a "crystal tarot" reading...and the result was basically the same thing!  I think I'm being given a message here.  I'll take that and go with it, I think.  And I've been lucky enough to have been paid large and wonderful compliments by Her lately.  They make me happier than I can say, more than I ever would have imagined they could.  So I guess you could say, dispite my migraine, I'm still happy.

      End of another week.  *sigh*  I feel so tired today.  Just dog tired, worn out tired, run down tired, tired.  I'm thinking that patience is the lesson I really have to learn.  I mean really really have to learn.  But it's the hardest one  to  learn.  How can you have patience for years?  I don't know.  And the multi-channel, instant gratification universe we live in doesn't help.  I'm just rambling now.

      Live in the present.  That's a tough thing to do.  At least for me anyway.  I always used to live in the past.   Why didn't *that* happen?  *This* would have made such a difference.   But since that revelation about She, and what we share, I've been over that.  I've gone past the past, as it were.    But now my thougths turn more and more to the future.  Could, for example, She and I have found each other, made such a profound impact upon each other, but yet be destined to stay apart for the rest of our lives?  Surely not, says I.  Surely we're destined to be together someday, aren't we?  Well, I had a though on that score.  I am a firm believer in past lives and reincarnation.  Not only that, but I am of the school that says that between lives, you plot out what you want to happen in the next one.  Certain way points along the path that you'll meet in your efforts to learn the things you need to learn.  Kinda pre-destination lite.  She believes in pretty much the same thing.  That being said, I think that what this means is that we've set everything out.  I think it's all set up.  I think that we will be together someday, because I think that's what we laid out before either of us was even born.  So now, my mind is forever turning that way:  So *when* will this happen?  *How* will it come about?  I'm terrible.  I just get past one and get caught up in another.  I have to learn to live in the here and now, and that's the trick.  How much do I  urlLink love life ?  7

      What t'heck is up with that shuttle guy??  I was taking the work shuttle again, and the guy was going on and on (yet again) about his dead father!  I mean, what do I look like?  Am I some obviously sympathetic type or what?    I mean, obviously he misses his father, but I'm a total stranger!  I know he needs support and help and all that stuff, but do I really have to spend a half an hour telling him what a great guy his dad was dispite the fact that I don't know either of them from Adam?  *sheesh*  On more important matters....She gave me a present.  I got a crystal from her...a green calcite.  It wasn't anything I was expecting, and I think it was so sweet of her to think of me like that.  It made me happy, and still does....  Also, been playing with my new Past Lives Tarot deck...interesting stuff.  But it's getting late...more on that later....  Love life?  Let's give it a 7 for now....  :-)

      Okay, a fairly quick post today....I have to get home to spell the mrs. with the little one.  She's been battling depression lately and it's been a tough slog.  She doesn't really care about him any more and it worries me.  Not to mention the fact that she's threatened to do herself and him a damage a few times.  Scary.  The one bright spot in this, however, is that the mrs. is now much better inclined toward Her, which is nice.  At least I can mention Her without raising a load of ire.  In fact She will even be comming to my son's first birthday, which should be a fairly surreal experience all around.  Migraine comming on, won't blather any longer....  Love life?  Call it 7 or so, thanks....

      Last time I said what a surreal experince I figured my son's birthday would be....and I was not disappointed... LOL  E was the first to arrive and I can tell you how strange it was to have her there.  Imagine talking, not at work, not on email, face to face, with spousal consent...it was strange and wonderful.  She met my dad, which was nice.  She met my son, and they didn't do well together...that didn't surprise me.  I think they've had past dealings with each other that didn't end up so well...  This time'll be better, I'm sure.  I talked to E after and we both had the same experience.  During the party, there were moments for both of us when it seemed like we were in a different reality.  That it was our home, our family, that we were a we....  And now it's something that we both miss, dispite never having had it.  At least not in this reality.  Yet. (hopeful aren't I?)  Okay...time to close...

      Another song that has made me think of you - always   If You're Not the One  "If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?  If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?  If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call  If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all    I never know what the future brings  but I know you are here with me now  We'll make it through  and I hope you are the one I share my life with    I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't understand  If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?  Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?    If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?  If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?  If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?  If you're not for me then why do i dream of you as my wife?    I don't know why you're so far away  But I know that this much is true  We'll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  And I wish that you could be the one I die with  And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with  I hope I love you all my life    I don't wanna run away but I can't take it , I don't understand  If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?  Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?    'Cause I miss you body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away  And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today  'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right  And though I can't be with you tonight  You know my heart is by your side    I don't wanna run away but I can't take it,  I dont understand  If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?  Is there any way I can stay in your arms?"

      Had a chat with E on friday and she asked a very interesting question.  "Why" she said, "do you have a journal that no one can read?"  She was referring, of course, to my paper journal which no one sees but me (at least that's the intention).  And the simple answer is, I have things that I need to say to myself, that perhaps I need to go back and see another time, to review and remind myself, but not anythign anynone else needs to see, or indeed  should  see.  But that brings me to this blog.  This is a public journal.  Something that anyone can see.  She's made me realize, that maybe this isn't such a bad idea too.  No, I don't think I'm going to dump my deepest and darkest here, I have enough trouble doing that on paper.  But some stuff, some of the lighter stuff, should go here.  And it's a good lesson for me to learn here too.    Don't edit.    Just type.  So that's what I'll do here.  Don't edit, just type and tell some of the things I need to....  So I'm putting it back on(the)line.

      I want to know what the future holds.  I can see that black toad from hell sitting on the horizon and I would really like to know what he's got in his pockets for me.  I know it's not good, whatever it is.  I'd love to know when we can be together.  I can see a shining light in the distance and feel the first rays of it's warmth, but I want to know when that brilliant star will shine in my sky for me to adore.  I'd like to feel like I'm making a difference...somewhere, anywhere.  I feel like I'm not doing anything for anyone, like I'm just wasting time and effort and could be doing so much more.  I'd like to do that "more".  I long to kiss her.  Someday.....  I wish I could see her more, talk to her more, hold her always, remove her trouble and her pain and let her do the same for me.  I want to know what I want to be when I grow up.  But then again, I don't, because if I know, then I'll have to grow up and be that won't I?  That would be bad, because I don't want to grow up... :-)  I want to be happy again.  Really truly happy, all the time.  I miss feeling that way.  Did I ever really feel that way?  It's been so long now I don't remember.  How do I love life?  Believe it or not, I'm about 7 or 8.

      I've often been asked "Which battleship are you?"  Well, now I know the answer, I'm     Richelieu  class ( Richelieu, Jean Bart )  Elegant, distinctive, innovative, and excellent. The premier french battleship, and one of very few battleships actually built that respected the 35,000 ton displacement limitation set forth in the Washington Treaty.  The  Richelieu  sported numerous unique systems, such as foil-skinned bouyant foam capsules to prevent taking on too much water from torpedo hits, excellent void and and water filled torpedo blisters, exceptionally well designed armor, some of the best (and longest range) 15 inch guns ever built with a unique loading system. Although it started life with a relatively weak anti-aircraft system on par with the Vittorio Veneto, it was refitted by the Allies during its rather eventful history to carry a much heavier anti-aircraft suite. This class was retired in the 1950s-1960s, with the  Richelieu  being finally scrapped in 1970.   2x4 15/45 9 6/55 12 3.9/45 12 37mm (pre-refit #1) 24 13.2mm (pre-refit #1) 56 40mm (post-refit #1) 48 20mm (post-refit #2) 28 57mm (Jean Bart, post-war) 20 20mm (Jean Bart, post-war)     urlLink   Battleship Quiz     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      E gave me a gift.  She made me a present.  A lovely moss green hand-woven cord with neat little beads and a pair of silver dragonflies on the end.  She made me a gift.  Taking the time and the effort to put it together with her own two hands.  Taking the time and the effort to collect ther materials.  Taking the time and the effort to know me and to include those things that I like.  My favorite color, my favorite insect.  She gave me a gift, and it means so much more.  No one has ever taken the time or the effort to make somehing like that for me.  Never.  Every time I see it, it reminds me of her, and how much she means to me, and how lucky I am to know her, and how sweet and wonderful she is.  She gave me love.

      What does the Dragonfly mean?  I love them, always have...but what does it mean?  Well...  Dragonfly: Illusion - Transcendence   The dragonfly, creature of the winds, represents the tricking of the senses and change. Its iridescent wings are reminiscent of magical times and, thus, let us realize that there is only seeming reality in this world.  The dragonfly teaches that nothing is quite the way it seems, and that is therefore necessary not to allow our senses to be tricked. Furthermore, the dragonfly conveys messages from elementary beings and plant spirits.   If you wish to make changes, call to the energy of the dragonfly.

      I feel the same, and I know you know that.    Every morning I get out of bed and I wonder why I did.  I don't want to face this reality.  I come home at night and I wonder why.  And always I dream of a home, one in the future, one where I'm me and I'm with my best friend all the time and I can just be and I don't have to explain or feel small or stupid.  I want to go home, too.    And you do matter, love, you matter to me a great deal.  More than anything.  You are the most important person in my life.  I couldn't do it without you, I really couldn't.  Thank you, thank you for being who you are.    I know how tired you are, tired in a way that sleep cannot touch.  Tired in your soul.  You aren't selfish, you aren't childish...you're just trying to be you, to be the real you, the you you've become.    Sorry, this is probably way more reply than you ever wanted, but I can feel the pain in what you've said, and I hate to see you hurting.  I just want to reach out to you, to ease that pain, to brush your hair with my hand and somehow make you happy again.    You are always in my thoughts, and in my heart.

      Went to visit E today.  Swung by in the morning with my boy for a visit and had a wonderful time.  She looked fantastic, and it was so nice to be sitting there with her, and playing with our three kids together.  They all got along fanastically.  My son taught hers how to play with a toy.  Her son fed mine.  Her daughter was wrestling with me and we were all laughing and having fun.  It was just so nice, and I felt so good.  It wasn't until I left, that I realized something.  I felt like I was at home.  I felt more at home sitting there with her, and the kids, playing and laughing together than I've felt in a long long time.  I don't even know when the last time was I felt that way.  It just felt so good, so right.  I just wanted to write this down, so I'll remember it.....
