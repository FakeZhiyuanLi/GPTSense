      Listening to:: Darling Violetta - Blue Sun Feeling:: Annoyed with Clare  This is my hideaway until Clare gets over the blog "fad" and leaves me alone.  I stereotyped Hannah yesterday - Weirdo Loner Goth.  We even have tables in our Maths room. The Chav table, the Goth table, and the mixed tables. Admittedly, we should sit at the Goth table, but then we would be classed as "Popular" Goths. Ew.  Never mind.  Our Art teacher sucks. Hannah got to do cool things and we have to draw shells and colour them in.o0  Yay! In music we get to do a presentation of one of our favourite bands. Me and Sophi are doing Darling Violetta. Even though she has never heard them :)  Never mind.  Moo Moo.  Bah Bah.  I have talked about school all the way through this.  Hmm.  xx

         I have merged three day's worth into one for easy posting and reading. Enjoy :)      &nbsp;  Feeling::Ill    &nbsp;  I went to the Gloucester Music Festival on Saturday. It was Ok. Well, Mediocre.    &nbsp;  I went with my dad, step-mum, s-m's friend, s-m's friend son (who has long hair ^^)    &nbsp;  I had a bad feeling on the way there. All I could see, as far as my eye would look was CHAVS. Small chavs, Big chavs, short chavs, tall chavs. etc. etc.    &nbsp;  There was a group tent, (which looked best) an urban tent, AKA chav tent, and an open air stage, where we settled.    First there was a bad replica band doing old songs, and then they went off and a band called "Stateside Hombres" came on (who have toured with _James Brown_. Wow. I am so amazed. Yet sarcastic at the same time), a ska band.    &nbsp;   My definition -     Ska- n - a type of music similar to rap in which the members must say the group name, "ska", or repeat a word several times during their "song". Only enjoyed in small doses.    &nbsp;   Dictionary's definition -     Ska&nbsp;- n - A type of Jamaican music similar to reggae.    &nbsp;  They were Ok. But they made my feet vibrate >   As soon as they were on the whole bloody festival flocked over! My dad hated it though. Plus I could hear the chav tent music.    &nbsp;   Boom boom yeah woo respect! MC Slide boom yeah boom woooh!     &nbsp;  Yuk.    &nbsp;  Anyway, that was that.&nbsp;I had a wet bottom and had consumed several cans of coke.    &nbsp;  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    &nbsp;  I missed the activity day. I have tonsillitus (again) for&nbsp;about the 4/5 time.   Mmm. More antibiotics.    &nbsp;  Round Chelsey's on Friday. yayayayay!    &nbsp;  Come back you minion. Comment!    &nbsp;  Baaaa *cough* aaaa.    &nbsp;  *tonsil falls out* Ew.    I have to have more teeth out. Crap crap crap crap. They won't give me general anaesthetic. If I want it I have to go to Wales and pay 200 quid. Or gas and air. Or injections again. *shudder* That will be 7 out in preparation for this stupid brace. I don't care if I get a cystic infection.    Moo....   -----------------------------------------------------------------    &nbsp;  Well, at least I bothered to show up for the last day. I have tonsillitus for god's sake and half the class couldn't be assed. "On holiday" they say. Yeahh. Of course.    &nbsp;  And you Hannah. Even if you are "knackered". No antibiotics for you. *takes them away*.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Lucy   xx    &nbsp;

       Get away from me you wax sucky doctor you :(   I still have nightmares from my otolaryngologist appointment. he was pulling my eardrum. I could see it all on T.V. I was practically crying :(  School's nearly out for summer. Yay!  Still have activity day, orthodontist and pointless last day to go. And Friday.  My wrist is so thin. And painful. Come back Miss. Physiotherapist!  I am a medical miracle. I must have seen about 6 or 7 different doctors in completely different fields :P (cardiologist...paediatrician etc)  Let's talk about what doctors say(stupidly).   Are you Ok? How are you? Do you need help? Well that was a bit stupid. Don't do it again! Does it hurt? What kind of pain is it? Have you done your exercises? You big chump.   P.S  Writer has experienced all above sayings.Unfortuantely.   Got Biccit? xx

       ...A Year 10 was running, then she noticed her hair... ..She tripped and she fell, yeah,yeah,yeaaahhh... ...uh oh...uh oh...uh oh...   Anyway, aside from my wonderful rhyme making abilities I can also make websites *cough* In FrontPage temporarily *cough*. It should be up soon in some nice shades of blue :) So calming.  My otolaryngologist(Ear, Nose and Throat) appointment is on Monday. I have my hearing back, which is a good thing, but i have to have a hearing test before I see the consultant.  I also think my wrist is sprained as it hurts like hell when i bend it. Thank You Clare!  My History Book Review is in for Monday and I have not started the book.  I must be the most organised person in the world right now :)  xx

      Feeling:: Depressed  NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I am not in Hannah's form. Because her group is too big and all 5 places were used up by them. She got Jess H though. ;(  It sucks.  Someone broke Mr.R's cup in the frenzy of trying to get a computer. Heheh.  That'll teach him for leaving cups on stairs. Muahahahahaa.  :;Note-I did not break the cup;:  Reports tommorrow. Uh oh. Judging by my tests I doubt they will be very good. :o  Anyway, I think I should go as some VI formers are prowling for computers. Tarara.  xx
