						    Today I saw Andy leaving the parking lot at work. I saw him crying. Tears were streaming down his face. I presume I know why. He informed us at work that his father was going into the hospital yet again. He was supposed to have another angio. The last time his father had this done was about 7 months ago and&nbsp; they put in medicated stints. Now here he is again, going for an angio. He said his mother would call him with how things went. His father called him the night before and made a joke about if his mom calls and is crying you know it isn't good. Well, by the rears rolling down his face, I can guess the news that he heard. I hope his father pulls through this all and I guess I wont see Andy at work&nbsp; tomorrow.

						    Thinking back I can remember many things from my childhood. One particular one I can remember so well, I can feel the emotion pulsing through me. It was Christmas 1982, I was just about to turn 4 and all I wanted was a Cabbage Patch Kid doll. Christmas morning, there she was! Jenny Bethany with her dirty blonde hair and blue eyes (just like mine) and her light blue dress with tiny white polka dots finished off by a tiny pink bow. I was in complete ecstasy. Nothing, not even the torment of my older brothers, could interfere with my happiness.   But What if?! What if my brothers were being typical brothers and trying to torment me by taking My Jenny doll. What if they were fighting over&nbsp; here and her arms ripped off. I would have been completely mortified at the sight of something I wanted so terribly being destroyed and especially by my brothers. The would have been a day of me in my room, on my yellow checkered bedspread in tears clutching my heart-shaped 'Tara" pillow my mommy had made for me.   Guess I am lucky they didn't torture me like that. :)

						    My first job was being a cashier at a local produce store in East Meadow. I was 15 and in 9th grade. My Earth Science partner worked there so she told me to go. Oddly enough, she was an assistant manager at the age of 15... Goes to show how weird this place was.   I worked there for about&nbsp;3 weeks. I got mono and strep and obviously couldn't work. So, they fired me. I was peeved but it was alright because they paid terribly and there really weren't any breaks. It was all a shifty&nbsp; place to begin with and the managers / owners didn't really speak English so that didn't help. After all, we got paid in cash so that should tell you something about the place.

						    My fairy Godmother's name is Faith. She is very patient and understanding. She is always around to lend an ear or for advice. Her words of wisdom are sincere and accurate. Her perserverance is a model of how I would like to be. She never gives up on anything she does and she never gives up on me. She is intelligent and uses her smarts to help others. Her love is unconditional and pure. Her heart is big nad she holds life as a scared thing.

						         &nbsp;    I see this little girl. She is on the swings in the park. And she goes front and back and front and back. She does real good pushing with her legs and arms to make her go fast. Maybe she is trying to spin around the bar. I hope her hair dont get stuck in the chains. That hurts.       I was walking in the park and I came upon this little girl alone on the swing set. She was so pretty with her golden her swaying back and forth as she pumped her arms and legs. It seemed she couldnt get high enough, like she was trying to excape and fly into the sky. When she leaned back to get the momentum to go forward, her hair pulled away from her face to reveal a huge smile, 2 dimples , a button nose, and 2 big blue eyes that were the color of the sky. She looked as if she no care in the world. I miss those days.

						     &nbsp;  Throughout junior high and high school I admired my best friend. She was so close to perfect in my eyes. Besides the fact that she could eat anything she wanted (like a whole can of Durkee potato strings or a half a bag of Cool ranch Doritos with a huge can of Arizona Iced tea while in bed) and never gain a pound, she was gorgeous. She didn't need to do anything to look that way. She was a natural beauty whether she knew it or not. Her wardrobe made me look like a homeless person. She was so smart and pulled great grades. She seemed to excel at whatever she did whether it be bowling or just playing basketball in her driveway. Of course every guy was in love with her and all she had to do was blink her eyes and they would flock. I had wished I emanated that kind of aura. She had such confidence (its obvious why)&nbsp; and it showed. I guess I admired her because I thought she was perfect. She was someone I could rely on and who was always there when I needed her. What else could there be?

						    If one were to look at the screen on my forehead they would see how much I am filled with love. I constantly think about my husband and how lucky I am because he waited for me. He is my best friend and I am completely i love with him. I think about my 10 1/2 week old little boy. How he is a true miracle. After more than 2 years tryingot conceive him and 10 months of carrying him, he is here. He is a perfect little baby and he is a mirror image of me and my husband. He is ours forever and we created him. That is still so unreal. Then of course I always think about things I need to do; clean, do laundry pay bills (wondering wher we are getting the money from this time), think abotu what to make for dinner.
