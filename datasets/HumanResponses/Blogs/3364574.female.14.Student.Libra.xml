      I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on her hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do

      oNe oF mAh Fave sOng  oF mIcheLLe bRanch  Something ‘bout the way you looked at me Made me think for a moment That maybe we were meant to be Living our lives separately And it’s strange that things change But not me wanting you so desperately  Oh why can’t I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better ‘Cause there was something ‘bout the way you looked at me And it’s strange that things change But not me wanting you so desperately  You looked me way and said, “you frustrate me” Like you’re thinking of lines and times When you and I were you and me We took our chance out on the street Then I missed my chance And chances are it won’t be coming back to me  Oh why can’t I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better ‘Cause there was something ‘bout the way you looked at me And it’s strange that things change But not me wanting you so desperately So desperately  Oh why can’t I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better ‘Cause there was something ‘bout the way you looked at me And it’s strange that things change But not me wanting you so desperately  I want you so desperately I keep giving in but I should know better I keep giving in but I should know better So desperately I want you so desperately

      hehehe >for mAh fRendz :)  Lift your head, baby, don't be scared  Of the things that could go wrong along the way  You'll get by with a smile  You can't win at everything but you can try.  Baby, you don't have to worry  Coz there ain't no need to hurry  No one ever said that there's an easy way  When they're closing all their doors  They don't want you anymore  This sounds funny but I'll say it anyway.  Girl I'll stay through the bad times  Even if I have to fetch you everyday  I'll get by if you smile  You can never be too happy in this life.  In a world where everybody  Hates a happy ending story  It's a wonder love can make the world go round  (And/But) don't let it bring you down  And turn your face into a frown  You'll get along with a little prayer and a song.  (Too doo doo...)  Let me hear you sing it  (Too doo doo...)  Now it's time to kiss away those tears goodbye.  Ooh...

      Sorry na kung nagalit ka di naman sinasadya Kung may nasabi man ako init lang ng ulo Pipilitin kong magbago pangako sa iyo  Sorry na nakikinig ka ba? Malamang sawa ka na Sa ugali kong ito na ayaw magpatalo At parang sirang tambutso na hindi humihinto  Sorry na talaga kung ako'y medyo tanga Hindi ako nag-iisip na-uuna ang galit Sorry na talaga sa aking nagawa Tanggap ko na mali ako wag sanang magtampo Sorry na  Sorry na wag kang madadala Alam kong medyo nahihirapan ka Na ibigin ang isang katulad kong parang timang Na paulit-ulit kang hindi sadyang nasasaktan  Sorry na saan ka pupunta? Please naman wag kang mawawala Kapag ako ay iwan mo mamamatay ako Pagkat hawak mo sa iyong kamay ang puso ko  Mahal kita sobrang mahal kita Wala na akong pwedeng sabihin pang iba Kundi sorry talaga di ko sinasadya Talagang sobrang mahal kita Wag kang mawawala Sorry na

      Not Meant to Be Alone and brokenhearted, I remember the time we departed. I know that it was hard for you, It was hard for me too. Lying in the cold, Crying in the night. I wish this feeling would end. Yet, people see me happy, but only I pretend. Still, you call me on my phone, Hoping that I'm still home. It's not fair to me and you, I know that because it's true. You're trapped in your past, Not knowing when it will pass. Looking sad and depressed, Your life became a mess. So please, try to understand, Hoping we'll still stand. Let's call "it's quits" and make a deal. You don't have to accept the way I feel.
