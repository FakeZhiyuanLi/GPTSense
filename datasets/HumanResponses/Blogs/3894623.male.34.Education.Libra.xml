      Well I grew up in the 80's, and like all 80's fight fans I was a big supporter of Iron Mike Tyson. Then all the craziness that has become his life started to set in. Last night he began his umpteenth comeback, this one brought on by the IRS. He needs to pay back 38 millon in back taxes and other assorted fees. He might have to get a regular job, or go back to jail or something, because the way some British slob in boxing shorts man-handled and ultimately knocked "iron" (or is it lead these days?) Mike Tyson out in 4 rounds; it looks like his days of raking in the money via a squared circle may be behind him. It really is sad to see how his life turned out for him. Even sadder is to think of what a washed up, ex-champion, ex-con; with no savings, and no friends,  has to look forward to in life... Only time will tell.

      They really don't care about customers. I bought a Sony Vio laptop less than a year ago. They told me that it's out of warranty because they stopped making the model in July and even though I bought it in August, they start counting down the year when they beginning churning out the newer models. They certainly don't compare to Dell or Gateway when it comes to working with their customers. My advice? Buy something OTHER than Sony...

      Well with a&nbsp;little less than 1/2 the season left the Red Sox are still stinking. They have to get things together and learn to win on the road soon. Or else it will be another long, sad offseason for Red Sox Nation.  &nbsp;

      Well saw Spider-Man 2 again tonight. It was even better the second time around. I highly recommend this movie to all that enjoy a great show. Go now! "I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.... MY BACK!"

      I am extremely bummed out. I was bidding on a GTO on eBay, and I got sniped by 100 bucks... I wanted that car so badly too. Oh well... I'm on the hunt now, I even have my liscence plate picked out.... Stay tuned.

       urlLink    Well it's all over for #5 of Red Sox Nation. In a trade that will mark this season, hopefully in a good way, Nomar was traded to the Chicago Cubs. So he went from one historical loser to another. I hope he can be happy there because he was miserable here in Boston this last year plus. Wouldn't that be irony if we did seem him again in Game 7 of the World series and he slapped the winning homerun for his new team...&nbsp; urlLink
