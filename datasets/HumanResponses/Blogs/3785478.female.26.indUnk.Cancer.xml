      Mom originally posted this as a comment, but I'm the midst of switching over to Haloscan for commenting services, which will wipe out all previous comments. :(               This is Mom to say that I don't know much that is new about Ev at TBS. She can't receive phone calls yet or check email on base yet. She is keeping VERY busy, though. Anyone know of a good church near Quantico? I'll add more when I hear from Ev. :) Thanks, Krist for setting up this Blog!

      Another Foist is now on the blogging bandwagon.    Since  urlLink Evie  mostly only has weekends to contact friends and family, I proposed that we start a blog to keep all of you updated.  urlLink Mom  will probably continue to forward emails and send summaries of phone conversations to you, but this way several of us who keep in touch with Ev while she's at TBS can keep her friends, fans and family in the loop on what she's going through.    Don't forget to leave comments for Evie to read when she's online!

      Just got off the phone with Evie this afternoon. She finished yet another rough week — which will pretty much be how they all go.  As I understand it, technically her liberty should begin sometime Friday night and continue through Sunday afternoon, but increasingly she’s had to go back to base Saturday morning for an early morning run, or PT or other activity. Today she had to be back on base to be up at 6 a.m. (sleeping in compared to her normal rise time, which is between 4 a.m. and 4:30) to run the obstacle course, which she failed this week.  I don’t completely understand it, but the obstacle course is a timed event in which they have to clear all the obstacles, and make the time — not once, but twice. She’s totally done it before, and once this week ran the course three times in practice, clearing all events, but there’s one particular obstacle she has trouble with. Apparently it involves jumping up (out?), catching a bar with her arms, and then swinging her legs up above her head. Once in the past, however, Evie fell while attempting this and hurt her back or her tailbone. Ever since, as a result, she’s tended to be more tentative because of this mental block. She can do it fine in practice, but sometimes the pressure of having 10 people standing around, shouting at her and trying to motivate her, gets to be a bit much. This week when they ran the course, it had been raining (probably because of the tropical storms moving through) and she failed that event. When it rains, the bar gets slippery and that’s what she fears. At some point I forget how many times she tried that individual event, but it was a lot — and a lot of times I think she fell onto the dirt, on her tailbone. I’m not sure how many feet she fell, but obviously that gets to be hard on her body.  Friday Evie was on the range, and qualified as a sharpshooter in both rifle and pistol. She was a little disappointed with her result in the rifle, because she was two points short of expert, which is the highest you can qualify. Apparently her pistol score was pretty good, because it’s really hard to control your shots given how much the pistol kicks or something.  Next week will be long and full. They’ll be out in the field a lot, practicing shooting from various buildings and things that model an urban environment. They also have lots of hikes in store, including an overnight hump Thursday I believe, so it will be a particularly long and challenging week. For the hump Thursday (6 miles) they have to carry some kind of pack that supposedly could be up to 100 pounds. There’s some confusion on this; Evie’s not sure it will actually be that heavy this time, but possibly by the end of training the pack could weigh as much as 100 pounds.   The following day, Friday the 20th, is Warrior Day, which used to be called Jane Wayne day. Apparently it’s a day for spouses and family members to come on base and experience “a day in the life of a Marine.” They get to go around in special vehicles, maybe shoot some stuff and … “best of all” … eat MREs! Ha. Ev said it’s a bit weird for those of them who don’t have family in the area, but evidently her roommates are really great. One will be hanging out with her adopted family (more on this in a minute) and has promised Ev that she will hang out with them all day and have a great time.  The “adopted” family has some to do with the fact this girl went to the Academy, I guess (the Marine equivalent of West Point?). Anyway, when you’re at the Academy, apparently everyone gets adopted by a military family who just kind of help you out, support you, encourage you, etc. Often these families are pretty high-level officers I think, so they can provide a really good perspective on things.  Not this next week but the one following will be even more intense for Evie because they’re doing martial arts all week. She’s excited about this because she really enjoyed her kick-boxing classes in Seattle (in which she left bruises through the padding on various classmates assigned to practice with her!), but also prepared for a brutal week. Basically, she said, you’re assigned a partner and you spend all week just pushing each other down, which understandably proves very hard on your body.  Then, toward the end of this physically intense week, she has to qualifying on the obstacle course for real! (This is when they actually score it; the one that counts.) You can be praying for that especially, that she’s able to be calm, do well, and overcome her mental block to qualify. I should mention, she said that a lot of times when people fail on an event in the obstacle course, they don’t go on to the finish the event. But when she ran it this week, she continued (despite her troubles on the one event) and actually finished very strong. It doesn’t count as passing because she initially fell on the one event, but it’s a mark of her character and determination that she nonetheless followed all the way through to the end.
