      Well, today being Memorial Day, we have no school. Wahoo. But of course, it`s raining. So, I can`t go for my usual two-mile run. At least, not when it`s raining hard like this, and since I`m only fourteen, my parents won`t let me run alone. Even though I live in this nice development near a mountain where there are very few perverts and creeps...okay except for that one drunk that scared one of my friends half to death and then her mom got out the gun since her husband wasn`t home...but other than that it`s safe. Sort of. But hey, being a red belt in tae kwon do and running a mile in six minutes, I should be pretty safe, right? But instead, I am content to do crunches in my room and then watch Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Our pastor`s son Avery let us borrow the DVD. The pastor lives about two miles from us. Avery is eleven, I think. Taylor is thirteen. And Tanner, the youngest, is nine or ten. We watched from the part where Eowyn tells Merry to ride with her to the end, skipping the boring parts with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. I think Eowyn should have had more fighting parts! I can`t wait for tomorrow, because we have the eighth grade class trip! We`re going to Baltimore, MD! Yay! The problem is, since we live in central PA, we`re leaving at 5:15 am and we have to be at the school by 5:00 am. It takes about ten minutes to get into town...so I have to be awake by about 4:00 or 4:15. I should probably be in bed now, just so I can sleep. Some of my friends have decided not to sleep, since there will be about an hour of "silence" on the buses. Yeah right, like they expect complete silence! Someone will be awake on each bus, I can guarantee it! Unfortunately, my group got stuck on bus 5, which means we`re stuck with Mr. Orris and Mr. Runton...not the most fun teachers on Earth. They have got to be the most boring ones around! Eep, shouldn`t say that, Mr. Orris is my neighbor! Ya, I live with the teachers...Mr. Orris, Mr. Underkoffler, Mrs. Tanner, Mrs. Fickis, Mr. Reeder, Mrs. Bailey...but Mr. Runton is the librarian, anyway. But Beth, Chels, Ashlee, and Casey are in my group. Aah! Why can`t Katie be in my group! And Emily? But I`m glad that Ashlee and Casey are in my group. Beth and Chels are two of my bestest friends ever! Katie is the other. Emily and I are going to speak Mandarin Chinese wherever we go, since noone knows us. Beth said she`d disown us. Emily will also speak Spanish, and I`m going to speak French, too. I`m going to be missing tae kwon do class tomorrow, since it`s from 1815 hours-1915 hours, and we don`t arrive back in Mifflinburg until 1930 hours! Oh well...

      Well, we have arrived home from Scranton, and I've finished unpacking.  I'll never see my paternal grandmother or grandfather again, which saddens me.  My grandmother (Nana) said to my dad that if he walked out of that door, it would never open to him again.  She has always put us on guilt trips (especially when Sarah or I was alone) and my dad says she seems to enjoy pushing his buttons.  But this rarely happens to my dad's older brother, Carl.  Dad says he was always the whipping boy, since Carl left for Vietnam in the war.  Carl and his wife Minda left a little before Dad grew really angry (which rarely happens).  Nana told him she didn't have to listen to this, and left.  Dad then followed her...she really aggravates me...us.  I have never seen Dad so angry.  He and her woke Sarah and me up, with their yelling stuff.  Mom said she was washing her face when she heard them start yelling, and then didn't want to leave the bathroom.  Anyway, it all ended with Dad and Mom going upstairs to talk with Nana, and then Poppy said he hoped that we'd all make up before we left.  Which never happened.  He told Sarah and me to make sure that we gave Nana a big hug before we left.  We began to walk up the stairs when Mom and Dad came down, but then Nana was standing at the top of the stairs.  She just looked at Sarah and me like she was ready to rip off our heads, and slammed the door.  So I left the house and went in the van and blasted my music.  That had to have been the worst, and final, visit.  Nana kept dragging Grammy into the conversation.  I pretended to be asleep when Dad and Nana were in the hallway.  Nana walked in and said, "he never treats Grammy like this, now, does he?"  Sarah wanted to tell her that Grammy never pushes Dad's buttons, and I wanted to tell her not to bad mouth Grammy.  Dad says Nana can be controlling...I can't wait to see Grammy, Papa, and Cindy later today.   I need to relax.

      Many people will come and go in your life But some will make a lasting impression I'm lucky to have met someone like you Full of so much warmth and real compassion  A great distance may separate you from me Yet at times I feel like you're so close Not just lines on a screen or a voice I hear Like flesh and blood I can feel and touch  I feel so calm and peaceful with you around Most times making it the best part of my day  If memories are all that we leave behind in life Then you have already left many to cherish I look forward to the many days that lay ahead The good times we share and were destiny may take us  Thank you so much Ian! xoxo

      Well...where to start...hmm...this morning in English...I was hyper...as usual.  And then I was a bit tired the rest of the day. Quiz in Algebra...I think I did pretty well on that.  The last part, where you have to make up your own domain or whatever, really confused me for about five minutes.  Then I was like, oohh!  Ya. Homeroom...meeting about the Baltimore class trip on Tuesday...Hooters is off limits, y'all.  And...I have to be at the middle school at 5:00 am...too early for me!  Meaning, I'm going to have to get up at like, 4:15 just to get ready on time.  And of course, my dad, who wakes up at about 4:30 each morning, is going to be laughing when I don't wake up right away.  Wahoo. Ya, I was just a little bit angry about that letter that was sent out secretly...Logan has it in his blog.  http://www.rebelionaires.blogspot.com/.  Check it out, read it...especially if you have music this half of the school year.  Yeah, just a little insulting...I'm no longer going to pursue acting as a career!  So I'll just stick with the doctor, medic in the Army or Navy, or CIA career goal. Countdown- 4 days until the last day of school!

      Last night I was scared half to death!  I had just turned out my lights in my room, and I had my back to the door, almost asleep.  All of a sudden, I heard the door open a crack.  It wasn't one of those the-wind-blew-the-door sounds, it was one of those sounds where you  know  something's on the other side.  Well, I heard it again.  I froze, and started thinking, "What if someone broke into the house?  Why isn't Sally barking?  What should I do?  Well, I could pretend to be asleep.  What if they want to kill me?  Feigning sleep...not an honorable way to die.  My knife is on the other side of the room, so is my bo staff.  My bat is under my bed.  Great, I don't have anything on my stand.  Stupid!  Well, I could always use tae kwon do!  I am a red belt, I can disarm knives and guns.  I can do this."  So, I turned around really fast and assumed a fighting stance while sitting up (really weird).  And, there was Mom!  "Mom, you scared the crap out of me!"  And, then she said, "I'm sorry, I just wanted to see if you had any windows open without waking you.  It's thundering."  So, about fifteen minutes later, my heart stopped beating violently (just kidding) and I went to sleep.  We had a huge thunderstorm with lots of rain and thunder and lightning (duhh).  And hail, too.  And that was at 1715.  Now, it's 1945 and there's still hail in the yard.  Mom's flowers have been mutilitated by it.  Mr. Gemberling (Kevin) taught tae kwon do tonight.  He really worked us out.  That equals my two-mile runs for the next two days, at least.

      Well...nothing exciting happened today.  Now, if I think about today, I might find something exciting that happened that is going to entirely contradict the first sentence.  Soo...if we all go back to first period English class today... English was English.  It was fun, as usual.  My favorite class.  Even if I like the teacher more than I like the subject.  But anyway, I was hyper again, as usual. Algebra notes...we're starting a new section on functions.  They're not as difficult as I thought they'd be, since I missed the beginning of them yesterday when I had band. In Music, we worked on our CD projects for a lot of the period...at least I think it was a lot.  They're due Thursday, by the way. Gym class...we handed in our locks to our gym lockers.  I have a whole gym bag full(literally full) of clothes from both field hockey practice and gym class...about three pairs of shorts...three or four shirts...shin guards...the list goes on.  And, then we played softball indoors in the gym.  It was really fun at first, because it was only the girls.  They guys were still handing in their locks.  What is up with guys being slower?  Is it because they're mentally slower than girls (seriously), so that makes them slower physically, as well?  Anyway, then the guys came out, and all of the girls were complaining, and I think some of them were swearing about it.  Oh well...there went the fun in gym class...the girls hated the remainder of the period.  Why can't the boys play outside?  The girls...all of us...hate co-ed gym! Lunch...hmm...went pretty well...pretty funny, too.  Funny story!  To protect one of my best friends...her new name is Mary.  And the one boy...his name is...Tom.  And the other boy is...Dick.  And the third will be Harry.  So, I was in lunch line with Mary, but unfortunately I wasn't paying attention when this happened.  She saw Tom, and he seemed to have this air bubble in the front of his shirt, up at his chest.  Mary said she had seen it earlier in the week, and was curious.  So, thinking it was an air bubble, she poked it.  And, "It was hard as a rock!  It was solid!" she laughed later at lunch.  Tom said, "Hey, Dick, Mary just touched my manboob!"  And us, never hearing the term, laughed our heads off.  Anyway, Mary didn't say anything but, "can you get me a sandwich, too?" when I went to get a sandwich because the other two choices for lunch were nasty...what were they...Rib BQ and...hot italian, I think.  Anyway, after typing in her school ID number, she ran into Harry, and he almost plowed her over.  It must have been the strangest lunch I've ever eaten. We watched a movie on Pearl Harbor, made in 1991 (50th anniversary) in Social Studies.  It had men and women from both sides.  Okay, there was one American woman in the whole movie.  But anyway...you get the point. In science, we learned how to use a Bunsen burner.  Pretty nifty, yup.  One of the girls in my group, Sheila, couldn't get the flint to work, and the other, Justina, was afraid of fire.  And then I was giving it too much oxygen...but we got the hang of it. In Communications, we read more of Tom Sawyer...okay I read while others were giving their brief summaries of the chapters they had read...so I was half-listening to them.  Emmy, one of my friends, said that Tom got an implant. However, I was on AOL a while ago.  One of my friends had a link on her away message to urbandictionary.com, so I clicked it.  There was a definition for manboob.  It's a guy thing...here is what it said: "highly pronounced male bosoms (you may refer to them as 'Bresusus'). Usually the result of inactivity, slothfullness, or gladular irregularities."  So yes, now I know what they are. I took a two mile run...pretty fun.  But, I am never doing two mile runs for three days in a row.  They must really tire me or something...it's the second time in a row I've used body wash as shampoo.  But yeah, that was my day. And, we had steak and spaghetti and scallops for dinner. And, I'm listening to Fur Elise by Beethoven at the moment.

      This morning seemed to drag on forever.  First, in English there was a vocab. quiz, but then Logan and I left for Enrichment.  Second period, I missed Algebra to go to band.  Then, I had to finish up the CBA (Curriculum Based Assessment tests) during third period; after the tests I went to FCS for the remainder of the period.  We watched Mrs. Eberhart demonstrate cinnamon rolls.  Fourth period, we had music.  It was the only morning period I had without any interruptions.  We worked on our CD projects most of the time, and we didn't stay in our chairs often.  Lunch was, well, lunch.  Social Studies...we had three quizzes on South and Southeast Asia.  I think I did pretty well on them.  Then, we discussed the Cosmic Voyage movie in Science that we had watched on Friday...thank God I took notes!  Finally, we gave our little presentations on the chapter of Tom Sawyer that we read in Communications. Tonight there is a banquet at the Middle School at 1830 hours for everyone in eighth grade who has been on the honor roll all four years and who has achieved an 88% or higher on the PSSAs (Pennsylvania State Assessment Tests).  I am still getting ready for it, which I have been doing for over an hour now.

      Youth Sunday went perfectly (yay!) Whenever someone went up to sing/act they would introduce themselves.  Take Lisa for example.  She went up and said, "Hi, I'm Lisa" and then the whole youth group said, "Hi, Lisa" like they do on Finding Nemo with the sharks.  Anyway, everyone was laughing because we said that like, three times.  It was really fun; I really enjoyed it. Then, we came home, changed clothes, and went to Grammy and Papa's.  We ate dinner there. After we came home, I ran two miles (I didn't walk at all the first mile, but I did the second).  I ran one mile in about six minutes (very happy with myself). I got a shower...and now I'm on the computer.  Woo. We're supposed to get rain sometime tonight...but there aren't that many "potential stormcloud" clouds...stormcloud...is that a word?  I like that word.  Anyway... That was my day.  Weird...I can fit in a box less than 7x5 inches...

      Today was a busy day...in a way.  From 0900-1400 my sister Sarah and I were at the church (Mifflinburg Assembly of God) preparing for Youth Sunday tomorrow.  Erica Kuhns, Sarah, and I are singing "Fly Away" by FFH.  We're first tomorrow, after worship.  Then, I think Lisa Trego is singing "Alabaster Box," which was made popular by Cece Winans, and then Chelsea Houdeshell is finishing with "Found a Place" by FFH.  After that, Josh Spade and Ryan Fluharty are performing a skit called, "Faith-O-Matic 5000."  Lastly, we are all doing a human video to the song "Invincible" by Skillet.  For Invincible, Sarah, Josh, Ryan, Erica, and I play "evil" people, demons or something (for the part about you can't stop the kingdom of God) and so we have to reach out at Lisa and Chels like we're trying to grab them and drag them down with us, but we can't reach them.  So, LaRue (the counselor) told us to pretend we were those weird things in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (remember, the Dead Marshes scene where Frodo falls in and the evil things are trying to get him?)  That really helped, LaRue said we were really convincing.  That made me feel soo much better lol.  We practiced our songs, skit, and human video so much, most of us ended up laying down on the pews while someone else practiced.  We still haven't worked at all on the songs for worship, which comes before the songs, skit, and human video!  Then, we went to Weis to get groceries.  Not much happened there, woo.   When we came home, I ran two miles just for the fun of it.  I need to work out more.  I'm getting fat (Chelsea Goss hits me every time I say that, she says I'm skinny).  I did it in about 15 minutes, I'd like to cut that down to 13 or maybe 10.  I got my shower and then watched part of Places in the Heart on WE (Women's Entertainment).  I still have yet to see the whole movie.  I think I'm going to work on my Mandarin Chinese later.  Emily Lepley also has a book on Mandarin Chinese.  On the class trip to Inner Harbor, Baltimore, on June 1, we're both going to speak Chinese whenever we go into a restaurant or something.  And Emily knows Spanish.  I know a little French.  It's going to be really interesting.  The sun is shining, the birds are chirping...this reminds me of a poem Mr. Mesher told us in Social Studies once, when he came to talk to Mr. Johnson, but I only remember the last two lines out of the three...  The grass is riz, I wonder where the birdies is.  Johnny was a scientist, but Johnny is no more; what he thought was H20 was H2C04....sulfuric acid.

      Well, today turned out to be quite interesting.  During first period (English) I was once again my hyper self...though normally I save that for Monday.  Chelsea repeatedly told me to shut up, though I did not (of course).  Algebra was funny.  We had a substitute who didn't allow any talking at all, and so of course they guys were talking or punching the wall and acting like they didn't do it (mainly Curtis...we're eighth graders, not first).  I didn't know we had gym today, so I had to borrow Brooke's sneakers...I wore flip flops.  In FCS we made banana bread.  That was fun.  Curtis was being hyper again.  Constantly hyper people annoy me.  I had a meeting for the high school concert choir during homeroom...I will be a Soprano 2 next year.  We did worksheets during Social Studies.  Mr. Sundin, our substitute, threatened to "knock both your skulls together" to Anthony and Joey, because they were acting all macho and stupid.  We watched a boring IMAX movie in Science that I've seen a hundred times before, and then in Communications we read more of  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer .  Well, I read Chapters 18-20.  I didn't know Becky and Tom acted so childish!  They never do in Wishbone.  I love that show...too bad they took it off the air.  Anyway, I straightened out this whole thing with this one guy I like, so now life is just peachy keen.

      Today turned out to be a not-so-good day for a field hockey picnic...especially when you have to walk from the middle school to the park in the rain.  But oh well it was fun. My church has raised at least $100 to help me pay for the cost of the National American Miss Pageant, which will take place July 24-25.  I'm very excited, as soon as school is finished, I'm going to look for a dress. I think I'm going to stick with French...maybe I'll take Spanish in college or maybe my Junior and Senior year of high school.  Parlez vous Francais?  Non. Anyway, I still have algebra to finish.

      School ended June 4, quite a while ago.  Now I'm a freshman, woo!  I'm going to miss my favorite teachers though...there are five of them.  : Mr. Joe Southerton : Mrs. Lynch : Mr. James Southerton : Mr. Fee : Mr. Sanders :  I could have alphabetized them...but anyway...  I ran two miles today...in the rain.  But yesterday at Brooke's, Katie, Beth, Josh, Adam, Brooke, and I played volleyball in the rain...we were all soaked...and then we went to Brooke's gram's to swim in her pool...in the rain.  It was pretty fun...even in the rain.  But it was kinda cold for me...76F.  I like 84F...you can tell I prefer Florida and the Bahamas to Pennsylvania!  The National American Miss Pageant is steadily approacthing...July 25-26!  I'll be competing in two optional contests, actress and spokesmodel.  And, I have to introduce myself on stage...I don't know what to say.  I have to say my name, hometown, and ambition.  "Good morning!  I'm Elizabeth Gordon, I'm from Mifflinburg, and my ambition is to become a successful doctor and make a difference in the lives of the people around me." Like I'll remember all of that when I'm on stage *rolls eyes*.  I still have yet to buy my formal gown and business suit.  I'd better hurry!  Good luck to all contestants!  Maybe I'll cook dinner tonight...I mean my younger sister Sarah and I cleaned the house today.  And the fish tank.  Well, I cleaned it.  It was fun.  We have the two side-by-side sinks in our kitchen.  I cleaned the tank in one, and filled the other with water and put in the fish.  Then, Sarah and I put the fish in our bathtub...it was really fun.  Except Sally tried to get at it.  And Sally hates baths, but loves to swim.  Weird dog.  Anyway, I could always make fetticinne al fredo...I can't even spell it.

      Well, today was track and fun day at school.  It was supposed to be yesterday, but we were supposed to get rain, so it was supposedly cancelled until today.  Supposedly.  Anyway, I hung out with Katie and Josh, Bethany, Brooke, Chelsea and Phil, and then me and Timmy.  The people connected with "and" are going out.  It was fun.  I became tired of writing my name and the same "have a great summer!  This year was really fun!  I can't wait to see you next year at the high school!" and then a tiny note about something that person and I did during the year.  Chels kept yelling at me to hold Timmy's hand or something...she thought he was being prude.  Half of my friends do, I think.  But hey I had fun. I ran two miles today just for the fun of it.  Okay, so I ran more like one and a quarter before I stopped to walk.  Well, I think it was more than that.  I don't know. Tommorow is the last day of school!  You know what really bugs me though?  I have an 83% in algebra...I need an 84% to be on the honor roll!  That will be the first "C" I've ever had on my report card!  Ever!  In my life!  I'm not going to tell my parents...I want to survive until tomorrow.  I'm never taking another cruise again!  Ms. Shade said we'd be reviewing...ya right!  We did like, three sections while I was gone!  Thanks a lot.
