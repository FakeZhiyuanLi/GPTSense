      Hey now,  What's up people? Want to know how much I won? Fuckin nothin.   It is difficult to know what to talk about in these things. I think I should go find some topics to write about. A random topic a week should be nice. I will find them over the weekend. Monday will start the new format.  I have been out for the past couple days. 1:00 am now and I just got home. Not tired though.   I have been e-mailing an old "girlfriend" of mine. I use the "" because we were never really serious. Just physical as they say. Anyway she IM'ed me a while back and we have been chatting. She always seems to be interested in my sex life this one. I am not sure why. This girl was not at all my type though. In fact I had some friends over to her house one time and everyone, yes including me, were talking shit about her. You should have seen her music collection. All crap. She had ABBA and Winger. You should have seen the faces we were giving each other.   We were seeing each other like 7 years ago and then I broke up with her when I met my baby's mama. We also started hanging out about 4 years ago. She had a shaved head when I first met her which was cool but she worked on her own car. That was what I remember liking the most. I know another girl that can do that. Why is that so hot? So when we were seeing each other 4 years ago she ended up leaving that time. It wasn't even anything like seeing each other really I guess. She would just come over once and a while. That was back in my parting days though. Every time she came over I was drunk. I don't think she liked that very much. I don't think I would either. Actually I know I wouldn't. I remember the last time she was over. I was in my bad passing out and I couldn't stay away for the life of me. She was sitting over me looking at me like I was degenerate. It wasn't more then a couple weeks after that when she met her current boyfriend. They actually met at a club right by my house. At the time she and I lived about 30 minutes apart. So now she is doing well and I am happy for her. She is graduating with a BA soon actually. Funny enough she is in graphics now and using a computer all the time. I remember when she got her first one and having to get her connected to the internet over the phone. She had plugged the RJ-11 plus into the wrong jacks in the modem. Anyway this is getting boring now.  Maybe I should make relationships my first topic. Seems I have a lot to say about it.   I am not tired at all and am hungry. I think I will go grab something to eat and look for a DUI check point to go through. They give you free pens and shit sometimes. What a Friday night huh. Haha.  - Matt

      Another day another dollar.   Isn't that what they say? I figured out the solution to my financial dilemma the other day. This quick fix has been attempted by many but only a select few have attained it. I am going to win the lottery. I got my ticket and it's a winner for sure. Five quick picks. How can I be so sure that I am going to win and still have to buy five tickets instead of one you ask? Well you're just going to have to figure that shit out on your own.  I didn't go to work today. My back is tweaked out again. I may be looking at back surgery again actually. I had the same surgery back in 2000. It did the trick then but it has since regressed.   I am moving soon, did I tell you that? I just have to get the hell out of where I am at. I will be moving out the Corona. This is by the Inland Empire for those of you who do not know. Just think Riverside area. This will be happening in Oct. I am going to be moving in with my friend Ron. This I am happy for. One of the reasons I have not moved yet is because I am really picky on who can live with me. I don't want my son around people drinking or smoking pot all day. To tell you the truth, I don't want to be around that either.  I used to work with Ron at an old job of mine. We were doing sales together then as he is still doing now. He is at another company though. Ron is an honest person and is great with Avery. All that I can ask for. He and I, in the seven years that we have known each other, have never fought about anything. I would live with him even after I win the lottery.  These are my thoughts for today. I will check in to let you know just how much I won.    Matt

      Hello,  My name is Matt (Zero). I grew up in southern California. I did spent a year in Texas but I was a kid and all that I remember is that the place sucks. Just not for me. Most of my younger years were spent in La Mirada. When I got into High school I spit my time between La Mirada, La Crescenta, Montrose, and Santa Clarita where I live now.  I am 27 and have a six year old son. My religious beliefs are not the norm I would say. I am single, 5'8", have been in committed relationships but have never been married, green eyes, pack some extra weight as I almost always have, and am straight edge. Straight edge for the most part that is. I do not drink at all...Anymore.   I like computers and technology, my kid, my job (kind of), and studying. I do not like religion, WWF or anything like it, religion, dancing, clubbing, and religion. Guess there is more that I do not like huh.    Matt
