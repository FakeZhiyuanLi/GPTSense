      I've really taken off on this story. My profile includes a random question to answer - mine was, "The children are waiting! Tell them the story of the frog and his wig," or something like that.  I worked on it the first two days, and I know what I'm doing with it, I just need to finish writing lol.  It's taken a turn I hadn't expected at the start, but I'm happy with it.  It's shown I have talents for writing other than depressed poems. However, I might have to edit the story in order for some friends to like it.

      I'm at a weird place.  I know I'm at a weird place.  For months I've been likening myself to a piece of gum. Ie: A kid takes a piece of gum out of their mouth and stretches it. The gum is now spanning one hand to another, with a clump at either end.  I resemble this because I'm feeling pulled into Chrisianity, and feeling pulled into the secular.  I like my music, but I like the peace I know He can bring.  I'm at a very weird place; I totally believe the Bible and agree with the principles and theology of Christianity, but won't 'succumb' to the urgings because I want to keep some things in my life.  I think music is my biggest thing.  Modern rock, for the most part, isn't following Christian guidelines.  There are some pretty good Christian bands - some have made it big (Evanescence, Switchfoot, Chevelle) but there's so much more selection in the secular.  I don't like being where I'm at, either.  Part of this (I'm paraphrasing) is my being uncomfortable with the statement, "You cannot serve two masters. Be hot or cold, cuz if you're warm, I'll spit you out." Ooo. I also don't like the indecision, and angst over trying to decide one way or another. I want to love him with all of my heart... but I like what I have now as well. Everytime I go to church I feel a pull - I've felt a presence - and then I come home, and do things that totally negate that. I'm kind of just watching myself wander all over the sidewalk right now.

      exactly how you wrote it (you know who you are)  gaining someone else's job well done is the only compliment good enough for ur job well done, so how is it, that something that u can produce make more, yet something is more, if energy cannot be made or destroy'd but merely change form, then it has to b E=MC², that the universe is an nearly infinite M=mass, n therefore, has an infinite E=energy, with the power greater than light, (agrumentively god's best creation). so the miracle of the universe, is the ability to live, the way to rather energy, that is so much, so easily, when making E=MC² energy, it takes a lot of energy, but dense, to make more energy, the E=MC² energy cannot be control'd as easily, but just released, meaning we would eventually run out of raw energy to use on matter, n in order to live, we'd have to destroy us, more than we can produce. w/o god, we're screw'd. n to think, a baby is a miracle, because it has more energy than an atomic bomb! bak to the job thing, money was excerised in the thoughts of so many ppl, the "thought" took over the "moral" of the idea, it is my hope, n theory that all thoughts, have, had, or have had a moral behind their creatation. but the more mind is involved the more feelings aren't. yet we could not live off of emotion alone, is y we have to wait for ur soul mate, because our emotions r so unquie that they can't possibly match w/ everyone else's. its kind of a theory that, sex(uality) is a helping tool of god, that substitutes emotion, when it is useful, but once again, corruption is something humanes were cursed w/. as for money. it soon became "how to get money" which came from "what is money worth" which came from "what does money mean". as in real life, a question ask'd usually leads to a better question, hoping for a better answer. when the answers to a weak question is ask'd then it is the hope that those answers can lead up to answering a harder question. it is mind blowing to think, all the question in the world, in the universe that is asdk'd are all lead up to one big questoin, which has one unfadable answer. this question is even more phonminal, then "what is the secret to happiness, what is the meaning of life, how did all of this become" because once those questions r answer'd, the big one will come. another amazing thing to think about it this. this ultimate question is so beyond human, that it will take many billions of years of existance to have enough questions answer'd to have the big one ask'd. who would answer this question? god probably, but that is also a huge question. amazingly that is one person slacks off, who may have the answer b holding us bak, from the ultimate answer. so is life like a question, that needs to be ansewer'd? it may b so, but that also leads to the question, what is death, if not the answer? death is the solution, yet life isn't the problem. something that no man, that has lived n e way. has come to find. mayb a person (man of woman) has found this answer, but merely thinks it is better to have us think of more questions than to have given us the answer. it is almost as if, people have not become good enough for us to no longer exist. but its kind of scary, does this mean we exist because of a question?

      I'm so disappointed, and I could cry... I just finished typing out a three-page story, was so proud of it, and I lost it... forgot to save... I think I need to bandage my heart... I can't believe this... I loved that story, and I only had it for the while I was writing. Shall try to recreate...  Update: (5 minutes later) All is not lost. I still have the concepts I created to hold on to and cherish. What I felt for that story was more than enjoyment or self-congratulation. It took so much and so little. I spent maybe half an hour writing it, but I poured my soul into it, giving birth, in effect. I  loved  it. And it's still with me. I was sick at heart, but my soul-child survives. Maybe I  can re-create what I lost, but not tonight.  My mother will never see a reason for me to stay on the computer. She is solid, and I am fluid.

           This is my sanctuary when I cannot handle the pressures of dealing with broken tools, the wagging tongues, the hollowness I feel. Where is that safe place where I can be content, relaxed, at peace? Are not all places what we make them? Then, that place is in my mind. But now, I cannot find it. Now is not the time for me to feel gleeful or amused. Now I am at war, fighting the forces of melancholy emptiness vying for my emotions. At times they besiege me, and it is then that I come here. To a place that cannot judge, cannot offer unwanted taunting or charity. It is emotionless, so it absorbs. And after a while, the mist disperses. As do I, knowing that the twilight is inevitable, knowing that I am bouncing my soul off of something soulless. An echo. A wall I can't climb, but can touch and feel its hard, cool stones. And suddenly a section of the wall unhinges, and I am allowed through, journeying from one damp heath to the next. But I am home now. This is my plain, these are my rodents scurrying through the grasses. I feel a peace. Not the peace of contentment, but the peace of familiarity. I know all will be well soon. The sun is setting, and windows twinkle in the waste around them. It is warm in the cabin, and she will have something hot ready for me. Soon, surrounded by humanity, I will come back to myself and forget my dispair at coming home empty-handed, forget even walking through the grasses beset by winged parasites. I will be warm. I will feel the warmth of their smiles. I will be happy.

      A week ago I was walking back from town and gave a start at the statement a poster was making: Hot Buttered Blues @ Reds!  Here's my train of conciousness:  "Hot Buttered Blues! That's the name of my old band teacher's band, Mike Butterfield, he's in town! *glee* He had to move away to Quebec because of cancer, but he's back, he was so amazing, had the town under his thumb, I learned so much with him..." So anyways I stole the poster from its telephone pole, my mother excitedly bought us tickets, and we went tonight. Well, we would have gone. I cannot get into the back of Panama Red's - it's a bar. I'm disappointed. My mom was mad - she can't get her money back. I feel like pouting, it's just that there's no point. I really wanted to see him. I think they should have planned better, because he did teach a lot of kids. Chris (from band) couldn't get in either. Aw, dammit. It would have been so much fun with Chris there. I wish we could have known it was in the bar beforehand...

      I think a soul is hard to define, but I think the best thing to call it is the "self". It's an entity unto itself, but it also sums up the state of being. People associate it with 'being' ex: poor souls, lost soul, etc. It's like, people get so used to identifing the heart with emotions, they forget it's just a muscle. Everything you feel is foremost in your head. When people feel like they have a weight on their chest, what is that? It's a body's response to feeling sad/restricted/burdened. A soul is the essense of a person, then. As for the tastes we can't imagine... I think the soul experiences everything the person does, because the soul is always with them, part of them. Everything in your 'heart' and head combined - every emotion and trait. And then, along these thoughts, where would you be without your  essence ? I think it's impossible. But imagine, if you couldn't feel love, couldn't experience joy at a sunset, you would have a desperate soul. This is just what I think. And I'm gonna blog it, haha.

      is one of the greatest eighties movies. It makes me smile, it makes me cry, and at the end there's a flood of smilageness. The movie deals with feeling neglected, social status, and pressures without being corny. The parts I find touching (read: I smile/get tears in my eyes) make me love the story. I like that it brought emotion out of me. Ironic: the sticker says "Comedy." That appeals to my sense of humour. Funny: It's rated R. Those naive folk back in 1985, heh heh. Ironic: The story's set in 1984. (Orwell!)

        To Siam and Sir, You're two of the few most significant people in my life. I would be so lost without you. Siam, you're my inspiration. I love it that you make me actually think about things, instead of just pass them by like I would be doing. And you usually don't even know you're doing it. Sir, you're my Plan B. As in, you're always there for me to fall back on after I run ahead and trip. You inspire me as well, and Siam, I know you're there for me too, but when I think about it, these are the things that I love most about you. Just wanted to remind you guys that I appreciate you, and I love you. Cheesepuff  p.s. - I composed this while thinking about you in the shower. Aren't I sexy.

      Yay, she's back, she was just going down to see her guy. Sneaky girl. It's kind of a relief... All it was, was her going down for a few weeks. I'm now glad that she got away for a while - last time I saw her, she needed to.

      This girl I'll call Taisa, whom I'm not the closest to but care deeply about, told her dad she was going on a trip with one of her friends, for her birthday. She ditched the car in town, did some other travelling, and got a plane to New Mexico, where she's living with a teacher. She had to have had a plan a while ago, and the teacher probably supplied funds. The police tracked her down, but she's 18, so no one can make her come home. I don't know... her family life was going to hell, but her parents do care about her deep down. She'll be happier doing what she wants, I guess... it's just, I think she's lied to me about certain things, and no one likes that feeling. She's extremely bright, she graduated with scholarships galore, so I really hope she doesn't sacrifice stuff for her education. Idk... I think she needed to get away from her family, but I kind of wish she was staying by herself, and going to university where she would have.

      I walked downtown this afternoon, in the heat, to get Sir her birthday present. She'd better be happy :P. I drank a litre of iced tea before I went. The thing was, when I got back, my brother was  still  on the toilet. He either enjoys sitting there way too much, or he needs prunes. Btw Sir, Happy Yester Day of Birth. Love ya

      I was awakened at 6:10 today - awakened with a rude awakening. Actually, it wasn't rude, but I had no desire to be woken. Even with, "Becca... Becca... papers, dear." This is the second time this week I've done my brother's papers. He's escaped off to camp. If "escaped" is the right term. So I ventured out into the cool morning in a tee-shirt, thinking surely the exercise would warm me up, right?  Wrong . My heart kicked in halfway through. I could imagine it -  must... make... warm... the... extremities... also . Aside from being slightly chilled, the walk was pleasant enough. I like sleepy times with no traffic :]. Walking right up to strangers' houses reminds you of all the humanity you've become numb to. A few people were awake. I got a dubious expression  (Why are  you  here?)  from a man heading off to work. Also a gentle, "Thank you, dear," from a lady watering her lawn. I was traipsing across lawns, but I didn't get yelled at from any kitchen windows, so people either didn't see or didn't care. I finished in about 30 minutes. My brother takes longer on his bike. Interesting. My path home wasn't full of dog do like the one my brother takes, either. I consider the neighborhood conquered on that front.

      I've had thought about this: Our languages are so formulated.  For example, yes or no questions. If our ancestors way back when had established different thought patterns, questions might not even exist today.  We might be severly behind where we are now, or very advanced. A positive/negative answer is an odd thing when  you really think about it. Or would we have questions no matter what? Sometimes there is no positive or negative answer, because there are too many variables. But questions are the essence of wondering and speculating, and people need to do that in order to move ahead. It's just that, when you have a question, you know which type of response the answer is going to be. "How does this work?" garners an explanation, while, "Is it raining?" can be answered with yes, no, or somewhere inbetween. Does this make questions a  needed  part of the language formula? I guess so.

      the Allegory of the Cave&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink click here  &nbsp;  This passage is especially inspiring and reminding for me.&nbsp;It says, "Rebecca, keep your eyes open!" as well as some other things. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I wish they would do philosophy in English class.&nbsp; The kids are as ready for it as they'll every be.&nbsp; Socrates, Plato, Freud, Poe, Elliot, Tolstoy, etc. etc. etc. I am a geek, but it's like, I wanna know!

      It was too weird... I was looking for synonyms for 'sparing' and&nbsp;found this word   ab·ste·mi·ous Eating and drinking in moderation.  Sparingly used or consumed: abstemious meals.  Restricted to bare necessities: an abstemious way of life.  Notice how all the vowels are in order? Maybe you didn't.&nbsp;But I did. Anyways, about an hour after seeing this, the same thing comes up on an anagram site! "Look, all the vowels are in order!"  lol, Considering this is like my one point of interest for the day... yeah.

      Well I didn't exactly pay attention to the whole service today - my mind has this habit of wandering whenever there's a monolouge. Bad me. But I did hear the pastor read out Ecclesiastes 3:1-8.&nbsp; Here, for reader gratification ( New Living Translation) :   There is a time for everything,  a season for every activity under heaven.  A time to be born and a time to die.  A time to&nbsp;plant and a time to harvest.  A time to&nbsp;kill and a time to heal.  A time to&nbsp;tear down&nbsp;and a time to rebuild.  A time to&nbsp;grieve and a time to dance.  A time to&nbsp;scatter stones&nbsp;and a time to gather stones.&nbsp;  A time to&nbsp;embrace and a time to turn away.  A time to&nbsp;search and a time to lose.  A time to&nbsp;keep and a time to throw away.  A time to&nbsp;tear and a time to mend.  A time to&nbsp;be quiet&nbsp;and a time to speak up.  A time to&nbsp;love and a time to hate.  A time&nbsp;for war and a time for peace.   It makes you think... Many Christians have qualms about killing and going to battle, but when it's for a good cause, is it justified? The other acts mentioned are more straightforward. It's hard to know what to do sometimes, but I think people feel the most conflict when it comes to killing. That's why they pray :]

      *Cringes* I think I've written one of those dreaded examples of teen poetry - the one's where the focus is on a person, and a relationship, and the rhyming is forced... I hope I'm wrong.  I saw you standing in that line  When your eyes brushed and held with mine   And you saw me standing there  Staring back like I don't care   About you  But I do   I still can't talk to you that way  I still don't know what I would say   Yes, I know that they  all  say  You give a part of you away   Instead, I carried you with me  And you, you liked to laugh at me   And then standing in that line  I knew the laughter was all mine   I saw you standing in that line  Out of space and out of time   I saw that strange look in your eye  Me pinned there like a butterfly   I saw your smile in that line  And it told me I'd be fine

      I sent Krista the other part of her birthday present today - a story called Kriscotilion. I basically just wanted to write something, and her birthday was handily coming up, so there it is.  It's kinda mean to a girl we know, but only because I needed a scapegoat. I feel guilty about that though. There are a few inside jokes imbedded into the story, but not so that it's excluding. (btw, Krisaat, if you read this: You've got more coming.) There's a link under Creations in the sidebar ~~> Rb out.

      People need a purpose, something to cling to. If there isn't one intrinsic to their lifestyle, they find one. This is why Macleans featured a recent, beautiful convert to Islam. She's found meaning, and it says something of society that people are very ready to read about it. Religion thrives where ever it's oppressed. Communist China? Chrisians gather en masse. People smuggle Bibles like cocaine and weapons. And here, in apathetic fat North America, nobody's really recruiting. They're allowed to be religious, and it suddenly takes a big element out of things. They don't  need  to pray for their next meal - if worst comes to worst, there are always food banks. Hurt yourself? Here's a doctor. No need to pray for healing. I think bin Laden should have bombed his own followers, and  then  blamed the Western infidels. People gather together after a blow - they're defensive, co-operative, and supportive of one another. Hell - why am I strategising for a terrorist? For the record, I also think bin Laden should be made to have a sex change, then live as a widow following his own principals. There's my piece for now.

      "Is love a fancy or a feeling?" Everybody has questions. I think I have an answer to a big one -  love  is the meaning of life. There, how does that grab ya? Think about it. Without love, or without feeling love, peoples' lives have no meaning. When nobody cares about you, and especially if you don't care about anything - you have a sad, solitary  existance . There's very rarely a case where someone is this way - because it means they have reason to love themself. If you saw a starving child as you passed by on the street, and their eyes didn't haunt you, I think you'd have a hard time finding something respectable in yourself. Then there are the zealots who care about a  cause . I've never felt this kind of attatchment to anything, but it's kind of like a replacement love. Everyone needs something to obsess over, think about when they're lying in bed awake.

      Sparkling eyes and pointed ears Crouching there with silent tears The wind whispers, as she waits Of things to come and hidden fates  She's the Keeper of the elves Night and day she digs and delves Wisdom written on her face Resignation to her place  Winter, summer, autumn, spring She doesn't dance, she doesn't sing Always searching stones and scrolls For things the elfin used to know  Before the wars that took their might Before ignorance, plunder, plight The elves had manuals and myths To learn and pass on knowledge with  Now all burned and left untold While consequences still unfold The elves don’t know the histories Of burgled gems and old glories  But, the Keeper, hunting still Alive because of stubborn will Finds tidbits of wisdom lost Of ancient spells and bridges crossed  Of proverbs and of prophesies Of how to calm black stormy seas Of a time when there would come A wise new king; a blessed one  So her tears of joy are fitting While she waits, serenely knitting The new King will come today She’s seen the signs - he’s on his way

It's been Monday for 5 days now ;). But, she's right here, so I can't really say what else she's getting. Has to do with a joke, and a girl to make fun of, and stuff... I'm kinda creative. Kinda. She'd better have a memory tho. Phantom horses. Er.. I mean... horses trapped in the army! I mean.. yeah haha. You can't know Krisat.

      I'm going to be at camp for a week. I think I'll miss Blogger. Strange how I feel an attachment to a server, template, and thought host. But it's like... Blogger can't judge. Blogger can't smirk. And Blogger lets me tell multiple people (read: the world, if the world was interested in me, haha) the same thing at once. I can gather opinions. My thoughts reap me more food for thought, as I see things from other perspectives. Paper seems fusty, comparatively. It's tangible, but slower, duller, and I can't explain what I mean. Maybe removal is a good thing. I could come back refreshed, with more to offer than raincheck comments and tired opinions.   I decided to pull an allnighter instead of rushing myself. I like the night. I might take a walk.

       urlLink See Article   What makes a person different? So different that it's noticable, that s/he gets put into different programs, different environments, a different life? People have this idea that retardation, autism, etc. make a person less worthwhile. What  is  "normal" anyway? It's usually defined by what it isn't.  Not  bi-polar,  not  paranoid. What if these conditions aren't really Wrong? What if God put certain people on the planet who were meant to be more and less special than the mainstream? What about savants? People who can't tie their own shoes can solve complex mathematical equations. A three-year-old can conceptualize a drawing better than most adults. What does that tell you? I just think we need to stop rating people by what they can't do, and start looking at what they  can . A person might fail all of his classes, but still be the nicest, most compassionate, intuitive guy on the planet. A old woman might not be able to express herself eloquently or pay her rent, but she still has a wealth of wisdom to learn from. Everyone is in a league of his or her own.

      I was running around uptown with my mom a couple days ago, doing errands and whatnot. Nothing especially interesting happened, but I did run into both Robbie and James, both of whom I haven't seen in a while. James told me I needed to get a job, which struck me as rather ironic, considering his lackadasical approach to life. Also considering that  he  was the one with the doobie in his hand, while  I  had just gotten back from responsibly stocking money in my new bank account. He's right, though. Standing there on the street, with him blowing smoke and everything... it just seemed a little off. Then there was the cashier at the store where I bought my new (gorgeous) shirt - I liked her right off the bat. She was 20-ish, pretty, and a little plump, and even though I could tell she was weary, she tried to be cheerful. When she went to go ring my shirt in, a little boy came over by her, and she was trying to discreetly tell him to go back where he'd been. He was probably her son, but it made me wonder, if she had to take him to work with her because she couldn't afford babysitting or something. I'm not sure she was even allowed to have him there if she was working. And then I noticed her tugging the front of her shirt down so I wouldn't notice her stretch marks. Like, here's this sweet, gorgeous, articulate mother trying to make ends meet, and she's nervous about me seeing that she's been pregnant recently. My heart melted. I wanted to hug her. And now there's going to be devastation in Cuba, and... poor Florida. People's sentimental treasures, the lives they've carved for themselves... some of them are going to have to leave that behind forever.

      We've had a damp week, and today was so grey, so cold, so sterile. It left me feeling alone, but not in a bad sense. It was solitude, not loneliness. A pure feeling where I just felt like flopping on the floor and not  being  anything, just another piece of dust on my way to nowhere. It was peaceful, and the whole mood of the day ...it felt like it was waiting for something. The Cyrs came over for supper. Charlotte is sweet, and Christy manages to be fun but dignified. Michelle is so  real , so earthy, so tangible. And sooo funny. We walked to Ashlee's after, and she had us in stitches. Tomorrow I kind of hope the weather keeps up, and then Ashlee (with her artist's eye for detail) and I can go out, and I can take pictures. I have this urge to walk downtown and observe - right now picture taking feels like this rite I  must  accomplish. I feel removed from everything, like the world is behind a window and I'm outside looking in. I know it has to do with my wanting to take pictures, but I haven't quite figured out how.

      No, not the band... What are kindred spirits? Souls that brush up against each other, that can be familiar with one another without having to meet, or without having to spend a whole hour together. Entities because it can happen between a sick old woman and a business man, or a child and a dog, or a person walking and a lonely teen staring out from the doorway. People can know each other from a gesture, a glance, without having to go for coffee and make superficial conversation. What gift is this? It isn't a bond between the two - more of a silver thread they both know is there, they both might not mention, but that replenishes both, quenches their thirst. It heals wounds, gladdens hearts, brings tears to eyes, draws people together and leaves them wondering if the other felt the same thing. It somehow brings slight pangs of what can only be described as compassion or nostalgia, the wish to know the whole of someone, not just what the hazy window of the retinas shows. It turns two into one for an instant, and in that instant they are each other's grandparents, each other's children, friends,  soulmates , vulnerable but strengthened through each other. Some friends can achieve it over time, some friends have it from the very beginning. But everyone feels it once in their lifetime, that this person understands them, could embrace them, could cry on their shoulder and have the other cry with them.  ...or maybe that's just me.

      I was able to rewrite it (see below) last night. It's not as long, or as good, in my opinion, but at least it exists. This time around I wasn't able to capture the moods of different things like I had before, but I guess this is good enough. Will have a link to it under 'stories' in 2 secs - it's called  Dreams .
