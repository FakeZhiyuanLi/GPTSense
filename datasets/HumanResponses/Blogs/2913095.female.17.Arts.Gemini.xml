So i put up a face..act fierce lar. But tat made me look like a gangster! haha   crap rite??    &nbsp;  I noe i do sound intimidating. I can be bitchy. I do seem arrogant.   Snobbish-brat?   Nah. i'm too lame & way too crappy.    &nbsp;  Just putting up a face..coz if not ppl will step over u..n perhaps even try to hurt u cuz u look weak. Defence mechanism...

        My throat hurts like hell..its terrible. Anw, heres alil' story..Yesterdae i accidently left my wallet @ the sch lib. Realised it only after i had luch @ Al-ameen..wanted to pay for my food & ta-da..Wallet not dere! *slaps head*     &nbsp;   So had to walk all the way back to skool. Thank god narita accompanied me. So herez da crux..i bump in2 IndoChine along da way. He was busy on the fon But he asked y im heading back to sch. So i explained &amp; we said our goodbyes.    Abt 1/2hr i received a msg..Guess who? yeah IndoChine lar. He asked if i found my wallet. I den told him not to be kaypo. He was like "Ei..asking oni wad"..I was like "I noe. U care 4 ur mcs ppl wad..Its ur duty. Ur kindness is acknowledged." Obviously, being the slow-mo he is he didnt realise i was being sarcastic. Y muz he so nice?? I was harsh man. I swear i've NEVER been soo mean to him. Hah..juz leave me alone lar. I dont deserve any1's kindness...Sorry.

       Well Siti was sick yesterdae. I'm extremely worried. Somehow it dawned upon me how real she is..how human?? Not tat she wasn't human all along..but i've always perceive her as this cherubic-angelic being. So wen she's attack by this sickness its as if even my lil' angel isnt exempted from this illness.Ok fine, im exxagerating. Its juz flu & cough..but hey its my blog &amp; i have every right to sy wat i think and what i feel. Juz imagine..when she coughed, her frail little body throbbing back & forth..Aww tat poor child _HUG_ kakak hopes u get well soon k..i love u soo much.    &nbsp;  Friday we went to Chinese High..SYF Gold performances. How idiotic of me. I thought 3 instituitions had to fight for the gold award. Padahal they we already awarded gold merit. But Anglo-chinese jc received the Play of the Year Award & VJc da bez actor ward &amp; MI bez actress award. Kudos!!!   Sat we went to watch the JcDc 2004 finals. Raffles lost to Acjc.   It was kinda boring..anw, we went dere to collect our COPs. The reception was excellent tho. LOVED the choc cream puff :)    &nbsp;  So here goes: im like CCa hopping rite. haha well dey opening a proper debate team..so mayb datz where my future lies anyway.. i don't know. I would like to consider myself more of a multitasker!! hahaha    &nbsp;  Oh narita- armani junior did us proud!!! She got selected tryouts for bridging minds or world debate 2005 :) -hug- i dint make it but i've always believed if its destined to be yours, it will be. If its not, bukan rezeki kitekan. So i'm realli proud of her & at least derez sum1 who can propell Millennia Institiute nationally. Rock on Chic! Anw, she deserves it. Besides, she can now prove to dose minahrians they soo haf no right to belittle her liddat. Eat up ur remarks scumbags!    &nbsp;  So we both will be hosting da NE mock election. Cool rite ;p    &nbsp;  My tummy hurts pretty bad..will put up more pics soon :)

       urlLink    Quite moments like this is the essence of time  urlLink     Look at me You may think you see who i really am But you'll never know me Everyday it's as if i played a part Now i see If i wear a mask i can fool the world but i'll never fool my heart  Who is that girl i see s taring straight back at me When will my reflection show who i am inside  I am now in a world where i have to hide my heart and what i believe in But somehow I will show the world what's inside my heart and be loved for who I am  Who is that girl i see Staring straight back at me Why is my reflection someone I don't know I won't pretend that I'm someone else for all time When will my reflection show who i am inside  There's a heart that must be free to fly And learn with a need to know the reason why  Why must we all conceal  what we think, how we feel Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide I won't pretend that I'm someone else for all time  When will my reflection show who i am inside....

        I wish i could tell you how i feel everyday.     I wish you could hear my cries of maloncholy.     I wish you had understand all of my pleas.     I wish you knew how much im hurting inside.     I wish.. I wish.. I wish..          I wont deny yesterday was bitter.     So bitter.
