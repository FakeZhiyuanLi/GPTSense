      hmm...just now i was working on a paper of sorts of what i plan on doing in life. i will end up sending it into the sen/rep(s) of mn for a nomination into the academy. i have a bit done but i really need more info in there. hmm... i asked my dad for his suggestion and showed him my paper so far. he suggested that i put more details into the paper. then my stepmom came into the picture. she started to talk about how i am planning on talking with a recruiter soon. but she seems to try to shoot down any ideas i have. example: i would really like to become a pilot in the air force. that would be my dream job. but to do so, i would need to get lasic surgery done on my eyes. according to a recruiter, the air force would be able to provide for that, and then i would be eligible for pilot training. my stepmom decided to bring up that i should not trust a recruiter's words at all. she said that why would the air force pay for my surgery when there is most likely many more people who have perfect vision that the military would not have to pay for to send them to pilot's training.  i dunno... but it just seems like she is trying to bring down my goals and dreams by showing me everything that could go wrong. its kinda depressing to be told that i am not going to be able to even enter the military straight to my face. the military is all i know for my future. if it does happen to where i cant enter, i am pretty much screwed. i dont know what else i want to do in the world. hmm... i'm going to get back to my paper now. enjoy this post aight?

      rain. rain... it is raining. or wait. no. its not raining. it actually decided to stop for now *as ominous dark clouds approach from the west*. i enjoy the rain. or let me rephrase that. i only enjoy the rain from within a building. but then again, i do like being outside during a nice sprinkle every now and then. that sounds odd. eh. moving on here.   i am spending way too much time online and on this computer. i feel like calling somebody, anybody, but i got nothing to talk about. yesterday, Derek and i were going to go the lake. but he stopped by Softee's while i was working and told me that he had to leave early. so there's a no-go on that show. i feel like doing something. just hanging out with a friend would be cool now. hmmm... i dunno. ever since i started this blog, i've wondered if anybody actually reads this stuff. i'm not sure if i even want them to. i should go get myself a real journal that would be cool. but this blog will do for now. i dont care anymore. i am going to put whatever i am thinking about at the time. this shall be my journal. hmm... that sounded as if it were trying to be deep, but failing miserably. haha. i like it.   guess what! i saw the matrix revolutions today. it is an awesome movie, though the first two are better. revo's seemed to be a more action movie rather than a deeper semi-philosophical movie like the previous two. eh. that was the best i got since i'm not much of a movie critic. if you want movies go talk to Glick. just dont dis Middle Earth. i'm out. ciao.

      surprising. i actually made it this long without having to take a nap, considering i've been up since 3:30 this morning with about 4 hours of sleep. damn softee's. that place is actually getting to the point where it is ALMOST bearable. BeerBottle decided to have a talk with Spitshine there today. BeerBottle quit back in March and apparently he might be coming back. that's good cuz then he could take some of the stress away from the place. but TYRONE and Glick have yet to talk to Spitshine. they need to come back to the place.   ...  i meant to be at Adriana's graduation reception right now instead of here, blogging. but i tried to get a ride from TYRONE but he had already left by the time i called him. i didnt know of anybody else to call so, no going for me. i want my license. oh well, by getting it when i turn 18 i wont have to pay 400 bucks. yay. and 18 is only half a year away... the possibilities.    this summer is most likely going to turn out to be worse than i thought. i just got flipped on last night for my fourth quarter grade in Chem. dammit dont they understand that there is more to me than my f*cking GPA!!!!!!!!!!!!! arrr... (venting blog remember)  but anyways. i want to go skate again. that was so much fun, even by myself. it was great. i must admit i am a loner skater. but that's fine cuz it lets me skate without the psychological pressure of trying to impress your friends. well anywho, enjoy my posts thus far, leave a comment or two, then get the hell off of my site!! jk. mr. roboto... haha

      today is the first day of summer. that's fine. i went skating this morning. 'twas very fun and i actually got back to the skill level of where i used to be. so im not that horrible now. i went down to the "skatepark" (its a slab of concrete with a box, a few highway dividers, and a pyramind) at about 8 this morning. yes i said 8 this morning. i was actually able to do quite a bit of stuff. i actually manualed the box which was very very surprising. i managed to throw down some other things as well, but now i dont feel so bad about skating whenever i think of Boyd's video. i dont think i will ever make it to where they are, but skating is all about fun. kohler, you should heed this advice. anyways, i think i'm gonna go and skate a little more now. happy summer, kids.

      well today was the last day of my junior year. yay. i am very happy to get out of that damn school and to know that i only have one year left. but then again, its like " i only have one year, but i still have one more year." i should be happy that its the summer now, but i feel kinda mixed. i am elated that i am done with this schoolyear but yet, i think that this summer will be very very boring. i am starting to have my doubts about being able to go to BT this summer. apparently thinking about my future and actually trying to take actions to help it are bad to my parents. jiminy they suck ascot. i also think that i am going to miss many of my friends. i know i will keep in touch with TYRONE, kohler, simon, and derek. but i will admit, i am going to miss quite a few others. i dont think i'm going to be seeing Raine at all this summer, or Sophie, Penelope, or Cynthia. that little trio are my best chick friends. i want to spend time with them as well but i doubt i will be. this summer is going to be like last summer. nothing but eat, sleep, work. dammit. but oh well. that is another reason i want to go to BT. i wont be having much of a life here, so i might as well get a head start on my career. but oh well. moving on now. all of today i had nothing but yellowcard and brand new stuck in my head. it was kinda weird, but i like those bands so its all good. i did see some of Glick's infamous "Gay Artsey Films" today though. those are a flippin riot and a half. best part is of Sophie acting beautiful. props to you on that one Sophie. g'job. no but seriously. i also got to see Boyd's skate video today. jeez. after seein that i feel like giving up on skating because he has progressed so far. i cant even do all that much. but i enjoy skating too much for something like that to stop me from keep going.in fact, tomorrow i will be skating almost all day. that will be interesting. i'm sure i wont be able to walk for the next few days though. oh well, legs are overrated. anywho i think i've said enough. a shower is calling out to me. damn the funk of softee's. dammit all to hell. g'bye folks.

      today was interesting. i had my last day of senora swanson!!! sweetness in its entirety!!!!! yay! but other than that. i got a low A on the first part of the chem final. someone decided that they would set the curve at 63, with the most possible being 63. damn them. but then came today's portion. holy hell that one is going to be bad. the thing was very tough n rough. and i found out that my quarter 4 grade will be an 81. that's alright for that class, but tell that to my parents. arr... but if i do good on the final, my sem grade should be pretty high right? ... right? no? yeah that's about it. i really should get working on this "life plan" paper. i need it to send to the rep/s and sen/s from mn, for recomendations to the academy. i dont even know how to start the thing. any ideas? no? does anybody give a flying f*ck? anyways... today is the eve of the last day of school. i'm not even looking forward to summer all that much. it will probably prove to be very boring. i will be very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very dissapointed if i dont go to basic this summer. its such a good oppurtunity for me and i really want to go. but i got nothing left. off to the life plan crap. i will leave you with some offspring..." have you ever been at some place, recognizing everybody's face, until you realized there was no one there you knew?" good song. "falling" by the offspring. listen up...

      hmm...intros are like titles. they're both completely overrated. so screw an interesting intro. i cant even remember what i was going to write on here. i know i had something... got it! over the past few years, i have noticed that i felt like i had something to prove to the world. why cant the world just accept me for who i am?? everyday it feels as if i have to prove myself to someone, whether it be friends, teachers, my boss. it seems that everybody has high expectations of me and i cant deal with that crap. i mean, just see that i am me and its not going to change. if you dont like who i've become, tough. i guess that this is actually the reason i want to go to BT so bad. maybe then, people'll let me be who i am. that and it will look very very good to the Academy. i cant wait to get out of this stupid town. this is kind of mean, but i actually want to go meet new friends, sorry. i think i have left a bad impression upon my friends.they are all very very very very cool but...i dunno. i just feel as if my friends are on higher level than me. i dont know why though. i think its because most of my friends are so busy all the time. i feel like i am being left behind. i dunno now. i have decided that this blog shall be my venting blog. yes... my venting blog... but anyways i'm done here.

      One PAYDAY, MR.PEANUT wanted a BIT O'HONEY so he took MARY JANE behind the POWERHOUSE on the corner of CLARK and FIFTH AVENUE.He began to feel her MOUNDS. That was pure ALMOND JOY. It made her TOOTSIE ROLL. He let out a SNICKER as his BUTTERFINGER went up her JUICYFRUIT and cause a MILKYWAY. She screamed OH HENRY as she squeezed his PETER PAUL and ZAGNUTS. MARY JANE said, "You are even better than the THREE MUSKATEERS." Soon she was a bit CHUNKY and nine months later had a BABY RUTH.

      hilo. the politically correct hello. it has hi and lo so no one feels bad. well, if it has only hi and lo then i guess that "in between" must feel left out. sorry in between. anyways. i said i'd give a review of last night so here goes.   i went to Fruitcake's party last night. it was his birthday yesterday and today is Langdon's. wow. anyways. it was very boring cuz he had a bunch of freshmen chicks there and almost no one from the junior class. plus, i wanted to go skate and nobody else did. but when i did go skate, the tail of my board decided to snap on me. dammit now i have to buy a new deck. i think verycontent has blanks on sale for 20 bucks. thats not too bad. Kohler was there though with his lady friend. he needed someone to put his bearings on his board so i did. then i used it to go to Simon's place. he had quite a few people over, more than i thought he was going to have. they all played texas hold'em and i'm not much of a card guy so i headed back to Fruitcake's place. when i got there, not many people were awake and those who were, were going to go hotbox Fruitcake's car. definitely not something for me. so i headed back to Simon's place. eventually everybody left to where it was just me, Simon, and TYRONE. we had a very cool talk about things. it was very good. then we went driving around. that was...eh. then i slept. that is my summary of last night. enjoy.

      have you ever had that really weird, bad taste in your mouth after waking up? well i do right now. disgusting. i just woke up after taking a nap. had to work at 5 this morning... and then everybody that worked today had no idea what the hell they were doing, so let me tell you, i was mad. then again everybody, at Softee's, means nothing but freshly-hired people. hell, i dont even know half the people on the freaking schedule. and that's not an exaggeration. i went over the schedule today and seriously did not know about half of the people on it.   tonight should prove to be an interesting night. i'll provide a full review of it tomorrow so i'm not going into details right now.  well i got nothing else. i'm going to go take another shower. damn this funk of Softee's.

      i was bored so i decided to go to quizzilla. it turns out i am all about indie rock. the hell is indie rock??? eh, that one was weird anyways. but apparently i am the greek god morpheus, the god of dreams. after reading the description, i thought it worked pretty close to who i am. props to the fellow who made that quiz. i enjoyed it. here's what it said by the way. while you read this, i got some angels and demons to keep track of.   "You're like the Greek God Morpheus, of dreams. Believing there is something bigger out there, and often lost in thought. You're imaginative, and smart - not always a leader, but usually the one who came up with the plan. You often ask, What if... and long to get out of the darkness and through the window."

      hello... hi... howdy... sup... how's it going?... hola? no. alrighty then. now that we got the pleasant greeting out of the way. today was an interesting day. i actually felt very content today for some reason. i dunno why. school still sucked. i still didnt do anything... hmm... must just be that the planets are in alignment... yeah whatever. George is so annoying. arr... and i have to go to boy's state with the fruit. dammit. he never stops talking about boys state to me. dammit George, SHUT UP! oh well... he's dumb.  anyways. i have nothing else to say, yet, i have nothing better to do. i want to go play baseball. tomorrow i'm actually gonna get some skating done for once this year! yeah! Kohler is even going to be skating as well. yeah! go Kohler! i really like this song. i dont even know what it is. but its good. music is one of my favorite things. i enjoy many types of music, from Godsmack and the Used to, get this, Eric Clapton and Elvis. yeah i know, elvis is gone now. but his music is still good. yay. alright now i really got nothing to talk about so have fun with this for a while. dammit i have to work at 430 tomorrow morning... shoot me. now. wait. i do have something i'd like to say. lately i have noticed that i am becoming jealous of the stupidest stuff. i have been somewhat depressed as well lately. its definitely not cool. i think its just that i want to spend so much times with my good friends yet the ones that i want to hang out with most, i have no idea if i am even going to see them at all in the summer. i really want to but oh well. maybe they'll read this, realize who they are and keep in touch this summer? as i leave will you be someone to say goodbye. sorry. little bit of the all american rejects decided to sneak in. they kick ass like no other. well lost prophets and thrice are both better. so is godsmack. so is hoobastank. so is sugar ray. alright so the all american rejects arent that great. go away.  blah

      hello cruel world. hahaha...just kidding...mebbe. anyways, moving on. i found out some interesting little scrap of info the other day. 'tis about langdon, the military and myself. langdon, supposedly, is going to be joining the army now instead of the air force. apparently the air force doesnt want him back. hahaha... that sounded mean but its my brother, he doesnt matter. hahaha...  anyways where was i? ah yes. after seeing my act score i decided that i was going to apply at the air force academy. chances are, as of right now, that i will be hard pressed to be accepted. they are looking for many extracurricular activites and all i got is stupid work. yay. but anyways. i was speaking to langdon, discussing my military options, and he brought up the national guard. usually i would absolutely reject the guard porque no me gusta. ah! i have spoken the language of satan! but back to the subject now. apparently i have the option to join the guard right now, go to BT this summer, then when i apply at the academy (and if i am accepted) my guard obligation will be voided. meaning i can get out of it then. all the while, the guard would look very good to the academy. hey look, a new paragraph.  last night i had the worst sleep ever. i went to bed at around 1030 thinking i might actually get some sort of good night's sleep but NO!, the korean doesnt deserve to have a peaceful night. i awoke at 2 to find my computer still on somehow (cough*langdon you bastard!*cough) after shutting it down, i could not get back to sleep at all. so i went to get some cereal and then watched videos until i had to go to school. i dunno.   good news. apparently TYRONE might actually come back to work. hooray. Glick is also coming back for the summer before he goes to college. double hooray. speaking of Glick, i feel i should be somewhat sad or whatnot that i wont see him for a long while next year. usually that would suggest some sort of going away gift to him (i.e. graduation gift) but screw that. sorry Glick. you know where i work so you know i dont have money.   i cant wait to graduate. school is so overrated. especially the last few weeks. in mr.b's what are we doing? watching movies for 2 weeks. come on now. just let us go home. but after high school should prove to be interesting. hell, half a year from now should prove to be VERY interesting. emphasis on the VERY if you could not tell. i wish i had more of a life right now... i blame that on my parents. arr... but to leave on a good note... i dunno. um... the sky's stil blue? shoi.

      i am very bored right now. i should go do something but there's that little problem with a lack of motivation... i seem to have a bit of motivational problem... oh well. but i must say i am progressing very fast on "angels and demons". the book is so good, emphasis on the second o in book. hahaha...sorry. this book seems to hold so many little facts about the catholic church and about things in general. dan brown has probably incited a few cults with "angels and demons" and "the da vinci code".   religion is a very complicated subject. i am an admitted atheist. i do however somewhat believe in reincarnation. i do believe that we have a unified force within us and that we each have an individual soul. i do not believe in there being a god who has set a life plan for each of us. but i must say that "the da vinci code" almost provided enough info to get me going to church. almost. especially with the concept of 'phi' aka "the divine proportion". according to this concept, everything in nature has a proportion to a related object by phi or 1.618. some examples given in "the da vinci code" include something like the number of male honey bees to the number of female honeybees in a nest, the distance from your shoulder to your elbow compared to the distance from the shoulder to the tip of your hand. this concept is kinda cool in the way that if everything really does have this proportion, it could be used as evidence that god has created stuff. i thought this was kind of interesting.  anyways... i have completely exhausted my train of thought right now. this should provide some good reading material for now.

      um... tonight i made a blog. i have no idea what i'm doing here. but i think this is sposed to be somewhat of a journal so here goes. today i did absolutely nothing. i should probably done something with my social report but neh, whaddya gonnna do right? i didnt have to work today though. and it is saturday. usually i work on saturdays at 5 in the morning. today i slept in till 11! yeah! then i did absolutely nothing the rest of the night as stated earlier. oh oh i did do something. i got angels and demons! well i downloaded it at least. 'tis a very good book. the da vinci code and it are so alike and both have so many weird interesting facts. i love it! well thats pretty much all i got. hopefully this is what a blog is meant for...

      This is something I found that a person walking in NYC said.  "There was also a charming young man talking to his girlfriend on the phone next to us: 'Hon, we should go out dancing or something tonight, it’ll be nice. And then afterwards we can come back to my place and have some awesome sex. Yeah babe, it’ll be sweet.' One tends to worry about the gene pool."  I thought it was quite humourous. Hopefully, the feeling is mutual.

      They are organizational. This way my "recent post" or whatever list isnt full of cut off sentences. Hahaha. Now I feel good for accomplishing something that doesn't really matter.   I have noticed recently that certain songs/things (but mostly songs) remind me of certain people. Example: Cum on Feel the Noise by Quiet Riot reminds me of, who else, TYRONE. Try Honesty by Billy Talent reminds me of Kohler. Poker anything reminds me of... well you know that one. Hmmm... to continue the list for no apparent reason or go find something productive to do... the list it is! The Offspring remind me of Boyd. The Used remind me of Dalton and Nate (can't really think of any catchy names for them so, eh, whatever). Ben Folds reminds me of, well, my good girlfriends? That doesn't sound right... let's go with friends of the female genre. Hahaha... I'm a geek and I know it! Remember kids, the first step to rehab is to admit you have a problem. Hi, I'm Pbre and I have a problem. Hahaha.... ok I'm going to leave now before I start creeping anybody out.   Hey look. Grammar.

      dia de el padre. eh. just another excuse for corporate america to sell gift cards. 'twas a boring day anyways. went to see the g'rents. sat around and slept for about 5 hours. then came home. eh.   is it a bad thing if i already wish i were back at boys state just as an excuse to get away from nearly everything here in c-town? no? didnt think so. this place sucks. i have nothing else now, though i was called shallow again today for some reason. eh. that person can go f*ck off for all i care. sorry. dont mean to be bitchy here.   i have money. did you get that? i...have...money... must be the planets in allignment or something... i dunno. i did have a thought today though. i was talking to someone else, i think it was Langdon, and we brought up the subject of girls. i kept referring to them as "chicks" and it occured to me that girls might find that degrading. hmm... answer at your own risk please, i'm out for the day/night/afternoon/morning/dusk/dawn (depending on where you live).  by the by, my hair is supa long. i have been converted to the brandon boyd look. wings.

      i am back from the bs. and that can stand for either bullshit or boy's state, depending on your preference. but the week went well. made quite a few new acquaintances. by the way, Poker Guru, do you know an Adam Fitzpatrick of Forks? and sophie, do you know a certain person by the name of Andy Swenson? he seemed to be a cool person, though he was located in the town of stillwater at BS. stillwater and my city of austin weren't on the best of terms. 1 in the morn and we were running down the halls, opening the doors to their rooms, chucking balled-up, wet paper towels at them... hehehe... RHINO!! haha... sorry. but anyways.  it felt as if we were at more of a boot camp then a governmental camp of sorts. our counselors consisted of a fruit, a hardass, and another fruit. but we did impeach and try our mayor for fraternization with the ladies (that's illegal). oh and he resisted arrest as well. but eventually we got him tried. guilty. haha... but we had so many assemblies throughout the week in an auditorium that had about 6 inches of leg room, combined with no arm room, monotonous speakers, and being awake since 5 that morning. all of this together led to a full BS nap time during the assemblies.   our volleyball team sucked it up though. we did win the toilet bowl. RHINO!! PETER!! hahaha... inside joke that absolutely no one that reads this will get. we did hold many a game of ultimate frisbee though. we tried tackle style but... ouch. i also sprained my knee doing monkey rolls during cal. great fun.   as for other entertainment subjects, i played chess many times. i ended up with a 9-2 record. not bad but could be better. plus we played hackysack plenty of times. that was fun.   some people decided to thouroughly piss off the minnesota sec of state though. somebody asked her what her opinion on gay marriage is and she responded " marriage is a bond between a man and a woman. done." many people then went up to the mic's and proceeded to tell her about their own opinions on gay marriage. now these mic's were set up for questions, not debates. let me tell you this, the sec of state was not a happy camper when about 15 people kept telling her that it was a person's choice to who they marry and trying to change her opinion. not good. counselors were pissed.   on another note, our city won the war with minneapolis. after they decided to dump water on our counselors outside, we agreed on a cadence run at 5 in the morning the next day. we went to sleep early, then at 5, we were outside. as we ran past their dorms, with open windows, we yelled out " HEY YOU!! MINNEAPOLIS!! WAKE UP!! MINNEAPOLIS!!" and let me tell you, we saw many birds that morning.  we were told at the beginning of the week that we would most likely leave BS with a new view on things. oddly enough, it's true. but i don't know how. i just feel like i am a new person, as if i am reborn. eh. i'm not going to waste many brain cells on that issue.  oh by the way Penelope, bill and i did recieve your guys' letter. we were going to write back but it would've been pointless because there weren't going to be any more speakers traveling between BS and GS. so i decided i would just talk to you later. and tell Acceb that we can take the death threats.   well anyways, i am going to go write in my real journal. more info in there. and now i have 70 bucks. yay... hehehe... TYRONE... the plan is going as planned? shoi.  poopscotch.

      well boys state is running along nicely. this place sucks to be honest. nothing but 3 hour long assemblies with about 2 inches of leg room plus the most boring speakers ever. running and campaigning for office is fun though. i have acquired 4 positions as of right now. i am the city of austin and the nationalist party convention photographers, the city of austin treasurer, and the county of houston treasurer. great fun. as i write this, i believe that the city of austin treasury has approximately 65 cents in it. big money. the county treasury has diddly squat. nada. but calistenics at 6 in the morning is fun. 'specially when you go run in cadence. now that is great. but anyways. we have a city meeting as of right now. i think we are going to discuss our war with minneapolis. ciao.

      Well, I have just arrived at St. John's University for Boy's State. Surprisingly, we have access to the 'net from here. So I guess my blog will not become as neglected as I had imagined. The bus ride here was very boring, and yes, Penelope, you were right. We did take a freaking school bus. No charter for the guys. My room is creepy. It's located at the end of a dark hallway. But I don't have to room up with whatshisface though. So that's good. It was odd though. The very first thing that the "guide" said to me was " You are? Okay so your room will be right down the hall. You have about 2 hours of free time until our first meeting. If you could just be there at about a quarter to three, that'd be great." That last line creeped me out because it felt like it had come straight out of Office Space. But anyways, I'm gonna go get my stuff unpacked in my room. Would you look at that alliteration. I'm out.

(all american rejects) but yeah, give me a week and i'll update this baby. and the week after the one at boy's state, surprises galore... hehehe... me and my mischievious plans... cream savers.

      well tonight we had another poker tourney. i didnt do so hot, but thats fine. i got second in the first game, then was promptly killed in an early hand in the second game. the poker guru won of course. it was still fun though. i enjoyed it, though i wasnt there for long. but i still think we need to have them on saturday nights. those are the best time for me. but anyways.  today i actually went to the bank! and now i have money!! 25 bucks baby!! now i only need that other ten, and quicker is better... hmmm... dammit Blindy, you owe me 20!! give me money!! i sound greedy but this money is for a better cause as i have previously stated. eh.  you know what? all of today, i have been plagued by a very depressing thought. somehow, over the course of the day, i have started to question myself. i have been asking myself "what is the point to my life right now?" (dont worry, i am mentally healthy...) no but seriously though. i wonder what the point to life is at all. all life consists of is birth, growth, reproduction, death. dammit whats the point of it all?? someone tell me. eh. i think i am just in a depressed mood for some reason. oh well. have fun with this post.

      i have officially been brainwashed into the world of texas hold'em. yesterday i watched the 2003 world series about 3 times over. great fun. i have figured out that if i were to play against phil ivey i would seriously piss my pants. he is the best player ever, though he didnt win the 2003 series. then later that night, the Poker Guru and i decided to enter an online hold'em tourney, no limit of course. i didnt do so hot in that tourney, as i ended up about 300 something out of ?800? people or so. the Poker Guru of course did quite well in that one. the next no limit tourney was at midnight so we both registered for that one as well. this time around i did alright. i ended up getting a straight out of my first hand and someone at my table decided to go all in against me. so i called and bam! he was out and i doubled up. i folded my next hand then on the third one, i ended up with a full house. the pot was somewhat large for that early in the game and my bets just kept adding. i eventually won that hand and was in 8th place in the whole tournament at that time. but i think i used all of my luck on those first three rounds. i had pretty much nothing for the rest of the tournament, though i did make it past the first intermission (the Poker Guru's goal for me) speaking of which, the Poker Guru was screwed out of a hand and ended up at (insert your place here Poker Guru) out of 804. but i dont mean to put him down with that comment, as he helped me along with the rest of the game. eventually i accidentally placed a call on a very large bet with a pretty much worthless hand. at this time i was at the big dawg table as everybody around me had up to 15000 chips ( i had 1500). so even if i bluffed and went all in, they could easily call it. so after that i was pretty much screwed. and i ended up taking 141 out of 804. not too shabby if i say so myself. but it was thanks to the Poker Guru. he helped me and has taught me well. next time we have another poker night, you better watch out Guru, for the student may surpass the teacher... doubtful. so that was my online poker night. enjoi.

      well its been a while. yes three days is a while for me. so whats been happening in the past few days... really, not much. lets backtrack to... thursday...i think? yeah thursday will work. i cant remember what i did thursday. oh i got called in early to work. yay. although thanks to that, i got to get home an hour early. did i do anything that night...? no most likely not. so that's thursday in a very small nutshell. acorn i believe. then came friday. hmm... early that day, i did some more skating. yay? but the rest of the day was spent doing absolutely nothing up until that night. i went to a nice little texas hold'em get together for about an hour and a half. i sucked it up but thats fine. i'm not much of a card person. i did have some caffeine though, bad mistake. saturday i had to open at Softee's at 5 in the morning. hmm... got home right around 10 from the hold'em and didnt get to sleep until...last time i saw on the clock was 12:54 i think. yes that's about it. so then saturday came rolling around. wow was i tired that morning. i keep thinking its saturday right now but its sunday. but anyways, then the rest of the day sucked though i did get to work with Glick for the first time in about 3 months. yay! i never realized how much i missed working with friends. but after work, took about an hour nap then did absolutely nothing for the remainder of the day, though i was invited to go to harry potter, pero no tengo dinero.   so where are we? we are at now sir. what happened to then? we passed then. when? just now. i'm out.

      i have done a lot of thinking within the past few hours that i have been awake. many thoughts run through my little mind. i have done a lot of thinking about my friends, my interests, and mostly on "relationships". somehow i got to thinking about some people i know and their relationships. especially one gal, who shall be named Judith (think of Saving Silverman and you will know what she is like), who thinks that she is deeply in love with her boyfriend. come on now. he is in the army so he most likely is not even going to have much time to see you anymore. especially if he is stationed overseas. plus, you are still in highschool. but if they really do become serious about their relationship, then who am to tell them they are wrong?  on the verge of sounding hypocritical here, i have had my share of "feelings" though i have never used the word "love". i dont know about this concept of "love". it is always said that everybody has their "one and only someone", but if everybody has this person, why is there so much depression in the world? eh. this is a subject i think that will be saved for that paper journal of mine, whenever i get that.   a glass of powerade on ice, music videos in the backround, watching birds on a post in the sun. bliss.

      life would be grand right now if it weren't for this headache... need fluids... anyways. i feel happy right now. i went skating again this morning. how fun, though i decided to leave the slab of concrete alone. but i am happy with my skating performance finally. yay. i also decided to go for a run today. a korean? run? get out. no really. go on. but yeah i felt like getting out and exercising a bit despite the weather so i went running/jogging. great fun. double yay. but i was called into work today. no yay there. in fact that shall not be mentioned anymore within this post but most likely will in the blog in its entirety. tonight langdon and i decided to go for a good ol'game o'b-ball. hehehe... we played HORSE first and i won that. then we did a little 1 on 1 and the korean won (but you're both korean!) hehehee... no but seriously i won. yay. 10 - 8 i did i did. can you say "pump fake fade-away"? so can i... seriously i can. i am not verbally handicapped. i feel bad for those who are though. that would seriously suck. but anyways, kinda getting away from the subject there for a bit. what was the subject again? i dunno either. time to leave.    am i a shallow person?

      ... ... ... i never know how to start off a new post. oh well. as a comedian once said, " if i were ever in a big city, i'd want to go up to any random person and begin talking to them from the middle fo a conversation. 'well how do you think i felt?' *laughter and cheering*"  nevermind. good humor is usually wasted on unemotional things such as this. anywho.   i think i really need to get a haircut. i have super-long, jet-black hair, right now, in the summer. not a good mix. but a haircut costs money and i still owe money to people plus i have other ideas for my paychecks... so i figure i will see how long my hair will get before insanity takes over or i cut it. hmmm... i tilt my head back and look into a mirror just to see that i have grown myself a black mane. i am brejchamon!! hear me roar!!   i havent held a deep conversation with anybody for quite a long time. hmmm... i really feel like having one though. how odd... damn the rain. i have a sudden urge to go running. i am completely out of shape right now. wow. i have the peculiar ability to completely change the subject within the matter of about two sentences. yay. i'm turing into Glick. now if only i can get tilting back in a chair while flipping a pencil down...  hmm... i want a journal. something i can write my inner most thoughts and whatnot down in. i get paid today... this week sometime a journal i shall have. wait. did i already say something like this in a previous post?? oh well. i tend to that kind of thing often.  books. i want books. now. tons of books. hand me something to read please. dan brown is getting old. his books generally have the same plot. person dies, person 2 goes to investigate, person 2 meets person 3, person 2 & 3 investigate further and end up getting themselves too involved, person 2 almost dies, person 2 & 3 finally solve the murder. person 2 & 3 fall in love. the end. BORING! hmm... as you can tell, i'm over that genre. "i want something else, to get me through this" (third eye blind) but anyways. my brudda wants me to get off the computer now, my computer. oh well. he is going to be trying to get some sleep i guess. this is brejchamon (with the mane) signing off. sayonara.

      I am in the worst possible mood right now.&nbsp; The worst.   I wanted to go to poker tonight so I asked for the night off from work.&nbsp; What happens?&nbsp; My&nbsp;shithead boss goes ahead and schedules me, damit.&nbsp; Oh, and he decides to make me the closing manager.&nbsp; I'm sorry, do I ever close?&nbsp; Do I know how to close anything but fucking lobby? Um, no.&nbsp; Do I know how to do deposit or even bag tills for that matter? Hell no!&nbsp; And who am I stuck with the whole night?&nbsp;  SON OF&nbsp;A BITCH!!!!  Is Mr. Bossman even there when I arrive, in case I needed any pointers at all? No.&nbsp; Our close went about as good as... hell, there isn't anything to compare it to.&nbsp; Now, the morning crew are going to bitching me out like hell because 1) Deposit wasn't done 2) Their beloved 'extras' weren't done either 3) Truck decided to come in the morning instead of tonight. (Hell, the people who were scheduled for truck didn't even decide to show at all.) and 4) Our close sucked.&nbsp; Bad.&nbsp; I'm going to be expecting a call tomorrow morning that will go something like this.   "Hi, is Pbre home?"  "Yeah, this is me."  "Pbre, why wasn't deposit done last night? And why was labor so bad?"  "Don't blame me.&nbsp; Hell, I did my best.&nbsp; Blame Spitshine for scheduling me."   And that is going to stop there.   I have found that the past few days, weeks perchance, have not been the best for me.&nbsp; I really would like to just sleep for a long while.&nbsp; Wake me when I'm 22.&nbsp; But yeah.&nbsp; I have been very very fucking stressed out for the past few days.&nbsp;   I have figured out that the Academy is going to be a very very very longshot.&nbsp; Hell, just getting the senatorial nominations will be a feat in itself.&nbsp; The senators are only allowed 5 nominees each.&nbsp; Same with the Rep.&nbsp; That means that already, I&nbsp;have a 1/15 chance of being nominated.&nbsp; I'm sure that not all candidates have waited until the middle of the summer to start trying for the Academy like I have.&nbsp; These senators want a shitload of stuff too.   Example:  Congressman Collin Peterson wants:  1) A military Academy Application.  2) A transcript of high school record.  3) ACT scores at the EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE.&nbsp; Wish I would've known that when I took them.  4) Two letters of recommendation.&nbsp; I have talked to my asshole boss about writing one for me but I'm sure he isn't going to do shit.&nbsp; I have no idea who to go to for the second one.  5) 1 page essay of why I want to go to the Academy.   And his is the easiest nomination process from what I have read.&nbsp; Dammit, I am becoming very discouraged about the place.&nbsp; My backup plan is to go to UND AFROTC but, not to sound snotty, with my ACT scores, I would like to try for someplace better, more prestigious perhaps.&nbsp; But I don't know where else to apply to.&nbsp; I even came up with a poker metaphor for my chances of the Academy but we aren't going to see that now.&nbsp;   Lately, my parents have been&nbsp;the worst in&nbsp;a very long ass time.&nbsp; I really don't know what to do anymore about my home life.&nbsp; It's getting to the point&nbsp;where, whenever I am home, I am completely emotionless.&nbsp; If I ever showed emotion, it would most likely end up becoming close to an all out anger or all the way&nbsp;to tears,&nbsp;two things I try to stay away from.&nbsp;   This brings me to something else.&nbsp; I'm a person who is always thinking about the future, what it holds and all that good stuff.&nbsp; That's mostly what I think about whenever I happen to zone out, which happens more than is healthy most likely.&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyways, what I'm getting at&nbsp;is how&nbsp;I have heard from random sources that a parent&nbsp;will usually act as a parent based&nbsp;on their own parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that make any sense to anybody?&nbsp; But, what I'm saying is,&nbsp;does that mean that&nbsp;if&nbsp;and when I become a father, am I going to be a major asshole like my own father?&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;actually scares me.&nbsp; I really do not want anybody else to&nbsp;have to go through what I am.&nbsp; I realize that at least I am not an Ethiopian child who wonders if they will be waking up in the morning, but be realistic here.&nbsp; I'm definitely not looking for sympathy here by the way, just to clear things up.   But I don't know anymore.&nbsp; I have so many things going through my mind right now, work, Academy, parents,&nbsp;and even other&nbsp;issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to be optimistic about things, but that's starting to become a chore and a half.&nbsp;   I'm sorry for this post people,&nbsp;I just needed some way to let it out. I'm done now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I think I am getting back into the blogging groove now.&nbsp; This will be my first back-to-back posting for a long while.&nbsp; How fun.&nbsp; Now time for some 'most inane details of&nbsp;you're (meaning my) &nbsp;life that no one in their right mind would actually care about' (straight from the blog of Karl.)   This morning, Kohler and I went to play tennis once again.&nbsp; We actually didn't do too bad and were both surprised at our performance, considering Tuesday's wonderful time.&nbsp; We also shot some hoops too.&nbsp; That wasn't all that great for once.&nbsp; Usually, I love to play b-ball (as long as the Vanilla Gorilla is not playing) but this time, it was all about tennis.&nbsp; I have learned to like tennis, thank you Kohler.   Today, as I was about to leave for Kohler's place, I noticed something.&nbsp; In our living room, there are individual pictures of each family member, with&nbsp;each picture next to the others to form one giant&nbsp;family picture,&nbsp;on the wall, each one updated every school year.&nbsp; I happened to glance at the wall and it occurred to me.&nbsp; My picture hasn't been on that wall for years.&nbsp; I don't even recall seeing it up there at all.&nbsp; My dad has even told me before that this wall was for pictures of each person in the family.&nbsp; As I looked at the wall, that came to mind.&nbsp; I thought to myself 'Ok, so my picture isn't even worthy enough to be on that wall now.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; I can see when I'm definitely wanted.'&nbsp; Usually, this type of thing would enduce a depression of sorts, but I just became very very neutral about it.&nbsp; It didn't even phase me a bit.&nbsp; I think I am joining Derek on the 'cold, cruel, and soulless' list.&nbsp; But that's fine.   Random thoughts: I remember what my best friend from 6th grade ( that was 5 years ago!!!) &nbsp;was like back in the day.&nbsp; We did absolutely everything together.&nbsp; The summer 'tween 6th and 7th grades, I think I stayed at his place at least once every week.&nbsp; Now, he is one of the most prolific stoners of C-town.&nbsp; This makes me think.&nbsp; If my best friend can change like that over the course of 5 years, then where are my present friends and I going to end up in 5 years down the road?&nbsp; Hopefully, not the same as the one described.  After thinking about that, it got me to start thinking about myself.&nbsp; Maybe my friend wasn't the one who changed.&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; That's completely stupid.&nbsp; He  IS  the one who changed.&nbsp; But anyways, after thinking about that, I wondered how much have I changed in the past X years?&nbsp; It's impossible for me to not have changed but how much?&nbsp; How much am I going to change in the up and coming future?&nbsp; Am I even going to remember C-town? ... Do I really want to?&nbsp;   I think that's enough thinking for the day.&nbsp; It felt good to express myself like that.&nbsp; And that, Karl, is a reason for blogging.

      Hey look. Another non-poker related post. Well, somewhat.   We were supposed to have a poker night tomorrow. When I was first told, it was going to be at either Simon or Derek's place.&nbsp; Then, the second time, I heard it was going to be at Derek's.&nbsp; Next, I hear that only a few 'regulars' are going to make it, but a few others that Derek knows will be making an appearance.&nbsp; Next thing I know, poker decided to move to Happy Joe's then to Hardee's, then back to Happy Joe's.&nbsp; Um... whoever was behind the planning (not pointing any fingers at all...) we need to get this straight next time.&nbsp; You tried, and that's all we ask.&nbsp; Hell, s/he never reads blogs at all, so let's just say this.&nbsp; Dammit, you suck at planning.&nbsp; I (most likely we) appreciate that you were trying to arrange something, but damn.&nbsp; I don't have anything else to say on that subject.&nbsp; Poker topic is done.&nbsp; Now, I have some good news, and no, Geico is not involved.   I went to work today.&nbsp; Yeah, that's not exactly what you thought I'd put immediately following "I have some good news" is it? Sneaky Korean that I am... hahaha.&nbsp; No but seriously though.&nbsp; I do have some good news.&nbsp; A co-worker of mine used to be a DJ before he came to Crookston.&nbsp; He tells me he has some turntables, slipmats, mixer, the works.&nbsp; They are supposedly at his sister's place for now.&nbsp; He is going there in the near future, so I asked him if he could bring them back to Crookston.&nbsp; He never knew I was interested in turntables at all but he agreed.&nbsp; He even gave me an offer.&nbsp; He is willing to lend me whatever equipment I would like for a while, take everything for a test drive (and I don't even have my license! HA! ... sorry)&nbsp;and if I do like them, he is willing to sell whatever I want to me, if it turns out that mixing really isn't for me, then I will be able to give them right back to him.&nbsp; This is a very cool oppurtunity and I can't wait for him to bring them here.&nbsp; I just hope that he is not just giving me a whole crapload of crap just to make it look like he was a DJ or something.&nbsp; I have gotten to know him a bit, and I don't think he would do that.&nbsp; Please be telling me the truth... please...   I WANT SOME TURNTABLES NOW!!!      &nbsp;     Hey, look, I have made use of the options though it is a little difficult to make everything stay in its place.&nbsp; Well, hopefully my faithful blogging cult has an enjoyable read here. &nbsp;     Turntables... so close...

      So Tyrone, you want something other than poker in here. Fine, we can do that. Wow. There is a lot more options here. Cool.  &nbsp;  But being as nothing really has been going on for the past so many days, I have had no reason to put any new posts on this here blog.&nbsp; In fact, I have not really had any desire to blog either. Overall, I think its a fair trade.  &nbsp;  The only thing I want to put on this post are my current favorites in the music department. Don't ask why, because I don't know either.&nbsp; I'll do my best to keep it to a 10 point maximum here. Actually, I'm going as far as I want to, which is probably a bad idea, being as my playlist is 106 songs long... (As you can see, I am somewhat bored right now...)  &nbsp;  1) We Still Kill the Old Way -  Lost Prophets   2) Best of Me - &nbsp;Starting Line   3) Desert Rose -  Sting   4) Beautiful Ways -  The Pat McGee Band   5) Stand by Me -  Oasis   6) Stop Crying Your Heart Out -  Oasis   7) Wonderwall -  Oasis   8) Hey Julie - &nbsp;Fountains of Wayne   9) Counting Blue Cars -  Dishwalla   10) 100 Years - &nbsp;Five for Fighting   11) Superman -  Five for Fighting   12) One More Time -  Daft Punk   13) Brick -  Ben Folds (Five)   14) Army -  Ben Folds (Five)   15) Rocking the Suburbs -  Ben Folds (Five)   16) Mr. Bartender - &nbsp;Sugar Ray   17) Letters to You -  Finch   18) I Stand Alone - &nbsp;Godsmack   19) Serenity -  Godsmack   20) Certain Shade of Green -  Incubus   &nbsp;  Twenty will work. Don't want to completely go insane here with this. I missed plenty of songs that are at the top of my favorites list but those can wait for another pointless blog entry. Have fun with this.    &nbsp;

      Alrighty, so on Thursday at about midnight, I entered an online poker tournament along with the Poker Guru and Derek, maybe, I can't remember if he entered or not. But anywho. Yeah, he entered, because both the Poker Guru and Derek were both out quite early and around the same time too. Wait. Maybe that was a different night? I don't know anymore, summer is becoming too monotonous to remember exact dates.  But back to the tournament. After they both went out, I still played on. After a while, the Poker Guru asks me how I am doing and then decides to watch my table while I play. Eventually I made it to first intermission, 55 minutes into the tournament. The Poker Guru was quite impressed that I had once again reached his very first goal for me. Midway between the first and second intermissions, he started to help me on decisions with what hands to play. Now some of you may accuse me of cheating this way, but I have not taken credit for my final place. I made it past second intermission and this is where I entered that other post. I can't remember if there was a third intermission or not, though I think there was one, because I was up until about 3:30 playing poker and there is an intermission every 55 minutes. Do the math... and yes, there should've been a third intermission. Eventually I made it to the final table of the last 10 people of the 999 original entrants. I was among them. After quite a few ups and downs, I made 4th place. That's right. I didn't stutter. 4th place... Needless to say, I was happy. But as stated earlier, I did not make it this far on my own. Without the Poker Guru, I doubt that I would even have made it in the money. So for that, Mr. Guru, I am grateful. Thank you.   On a final note, I'd like to say that I am sorry for any doubt that I may have had for the Karl. I went all in quite a few times pre-flop with a Karl, and not once did it fail me. More poker awaits me...

In that multi-table tourney the other night, Mr. Pbre (which also happens to be my online poker alias) finished in a very comfortable 4th place, thanks to the Poker Guru. Gotsta go. More details later, if anybody cares.

      On my bro's cd i found this. There was piano and some sort of orchestra in the backround as this was said.   Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word, fuck. Out of all the English words that begin with the letter f, fuck is the only word referred to as the f-word. Its the one magical word that, just by itself, can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from the German word, ficken, which means to strike. In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories. As a transitive verb for instance, ‘John fucked Shirley‘, as an intransitive verb, ‘Shirley fucks‘. Its meaning is not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective such as ‘Johns doing all the fucking work‘, as part of an adverb, ‘Shirley talks too fucking much‘, as an adverb enhancing an adjective, ‘Shirley is fucking beautiful‘, as the object of an adverb, ‘Shirley is fucking beautifully‘, as a noun, ‘I don’t give a fuck‘, as part of a word, ‘abso-fucking-lutley‘, or, ‘in-fucking-credible‘, and as almost every word in a sentence, ‘fuck the fucking fuckers‘. As you may realize, there are very few words with the versatility of fuck. As in these examples describing situations, such as, fraud. ‘I got fucked at the used car lot’. Dismay. ‘Aw, fuck it’. Trouble. ‘I guess I'm really fucked now‘. Aggression. ‘Don’t fuck with me, buddy‘. Difficulty. ‘I don’t understand this fucking question‘. Inquiry. ‘Who the fuck was that?’ Dissatisfaction. ‘I don’t like what the fuck is going on here‘. Incompetence. ‘He's a fuckoff‘. Dismissal. ‘Why don’t you go outside and play hide-and-go-fuck-yourself?’. I'm sure you can think of many more examples. With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use this word? We say use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech. It will identify the quality of your character immediately, so say it loudly and proudly, 'FUCK YOU'.  I found it quite humorous as well (mostly because of how serious the guy sounded as the music played in the backround), but if you feel differently (i.e. you are offended by this) then I apologize here.

      1) Blogger doesn't like me much. 7 tries until I was finally able to log in. Stupid.  2) I haven't listened to a single piece of techno ever since I started listening to Oasis and whatnot. Odd...  3) CD's. He has my CD's... yay.  4) Where are the turntables??  5) Meow?
