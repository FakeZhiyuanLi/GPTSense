       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I am in the internet cafe checking on my emails and posting another blog. I'm running out of ideas as to what title I'll give this so please bear with me...My day at work was pretty productive. I was busy investigating the bug Mr. Yabe emailed this morning. I've already finished the modification so I'll help Armi tomorrow with the other 2 bugs. I'll be gone for about a week so all bugs must be fixed so as not to burden Armi. Later this p.m. Utik came to the office and brought some jewelries. As usual I was excited to look at them and luckily I found the bracelet that I like at first sight! It was expensive but it's a gift for myself. It's my first real italian-gold&nbsp;bracelet that I brought. =)     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is Friday!!! Plenty of things to do at the office. There's the Sportsfest meeting, bugs to fix, call Citibank to inquire about the cheque, go to Macro to buy diapers for grandma and our team meeting. Of course, there's the usual Friday Night Out with my girlfriends but we are planning on eating at Shakeys' and later on go to Maricris' hotel room to watch DVD. Then off to the bus terminal at 2a.m. But before that, I have to pack my bag tonight and do some last minute preparations. Well that's all for now. I have to go home now and talk to my sister. Goodnight, my dear blog!!! ;p

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the pitter, patter of the rain outside, I long to go out and feel the rain on my skin. As I read Claire's blog, I do agree with her that life as a child is much more simpler compared to that of an adult.&nbsp; You don't have to worry about money, lovelife and life, the only thing you have to worry about is when you'll be able to have fun again. But looking back, I did enjoy my childhood. I played with my sister, cousins and "hacienda's" children. Television was not much of a factor back then, we interact more with each other. We played "taxi!", jackstones, "tumba-preso", hide-and-seek and all sorts of games that we could think of. Injuries abound me especially since I like to play boy's games like somersaults(which resulted to a broken ankle ;p). I had lots&nbsp;of childhood friends up until now eventhough most of them are married and have children of their own. I do wish that my children, i.e. if God permits =), would have the same opportunity to experience those things.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always have mixed feelings when it rains. It makes me happy when it's weekend and I can sleep all day long. :p It makes me sad when I'm depressed and i feel so alone. But i'm only human so i'm entitled to being moody once in while. Right now, as I'm writing this blog, I'm a little bit worried that if this rain keeps up it would be a bit dangerous going home to Bacolod. The roads are slippery and I have to pass thru steep mountains and slippery roads before I can arrive to my destination. Rain or shine, I want to go home. I miss my parents. It's been months since we last saw each other. I'm so excited, one day more to go and i'm going home!!! I don't have that much activities to do there except visiting my family, Pio's family and of course, Pio...two months more to go before his 2nd death annivesary and I miss him still. Maybe I'll always miss him. I wish.....But enough of my gloomy thoughts! I'm glad to know him and knowing that he's happy wherever he is. He's my angel... =)     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a happier note, I'm busy at work meaning Armi and I have something to do. hehehe...I'm also excited to see what Utik is bringing this afternoon. Hopefully she'll bring jewelries that I'll like. Andy emailed me early this morning. It was good to hear from him especially after clearing up some issues. I'm sweet, eh? lol...

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is full of surprises! Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down. It's like a big game being played out and I'm one of its players. Yesterday was pretty emotional time for me especially finding out that my brother failed in 2 of his subjects. It feels like I failed too as a sister since I didn't know why this happened. But things have a way of working out. On a positive side, I'm glad it happened and made my brother realized his mistakes. Last night, I've seen how sorry he was and wished that it never happened. It was heartrending to see someone you love cry but in the end it matters that he knew and learned from his negligence.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family and friends are real treasures in life. Thanks Papa for the words of wisdom. Thanks Ri for listening to my ranting. Thanks to all you guys for the jokes that enables me to forget my problems. Thank you God... I feel so blessed today. It rained but the sun shines after it. I got in from work by 8:01a.m. but the guard consented to my filing of failure to swipe in at 8:00a.m. The canteen has the Thirsty stand built. My Japanese client gave his permission to my leave of absence next week. We will go to Slimmers later on to have a workout. I'll be able to watch the Amazing Race by 8p.m....So many things to be thankful about. Hopefully, you'll have a good day like mine!!! =)

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hello again my dear blog. i am bothered. my sister told me this morning that one or 2 of my brothers' grades were either NC or 5.0. i am afraid that he'll lose his scholarship because of his negligence.&nbsp;i sure hope not. i wish to almighty God that it's not true. please please don't let it be true. if it's true, i hope that he'll be given another chance to do better...    afterthought : ************* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:52p.m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after talking to Papa thru email, I feel much much better. he said not to worry, if that is God's will&nbsp;we have to accept it. though there was no stipulation in the scholarship that says it will be cut-off if the said student doesn't pass. so i'm hoping that won't happen to Toto. =)

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello my dear Blog! Here I am once again writing to you about the details of my life yesterday and today...Monday is a blue day for me since it means another boring day at work. And it's true since I had an undertime again for this week because I woke up late. ;p My morning was routinary, I check my mails, answered some of them, post to my blog, chat with Ria thru IP, had brunch and read fanfiction stories of Harry Potter.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon, Armi and I attended the SWQC Training courtesy of Carlo M. for project related activity. It was boring but educational. I was sleepy the whole time I was there so I went out and bought some chocolates to chew from Georgia. It worked!!! That was 2hours of training for me... =) By 3pm, I am so ready to go out and eat at the canteen to revive myself. Surprisingly, the newly promoted SV's of module 1 treated us to a Pizza Party! It was huge, there were about 5 big boxes of JCA pizzas and enough to feed a small army. Claire, Arlene and I stuffed ourselves with the pizza and coke. Due to the abundance of the pizza, we got 3 big slices of it to give it to Monette, Ria and Georgia who were in the canteen. That was break time... As time neared for 5pm, Armi and I received some emails from Mr. Yabe. Thank you God! At long last, we would have something to do now. In the excitement, we investigated the problem right away. We found out that the modification was minimal and we could do the necessary changes in a day. Too bad nothing to do again in a couple of days. =(   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jewelry is the one thing that I really love to collect. But with jewelry should come hand in hand with money and that I am in scarcity of. :p Utik came at around 6pm and bought some jewelry with her. At first, I don't have any intention of buying one since I knew that it was&nbsp;expensive. But I've fallen in love (??? ;p)&nbsp;with the necklace right away. So I took it and that my friends I have to pay for the next 5months. lol... It was fun trying out the jewelry and checking if it suits me. Utik also shared some insights on lovelife, married life and the right attitude in keeping the relationship. So that counts too... As time rolled into 8pm, we went out and ate our dinner at Tsibogs and ordered adobong Kangkong, grilled Pork Belly, grilled Bangus, coke and rice. It was fun eating out with friends, talking just about anything that we could think of though mostly it focuses on men. haha! After that, we went to Kirstin's apartment to check out some jewelries again. I loved the bracelet at first fitting with the heart and pebble-like design on it but it was too expensive for my budget. Maybe later, I still have to check Utik's wares on Thursday so I'll decide then if I'll get it or not. On the other hand, Georgia got a very nice heart bracelet. =) Right after then, Claire, Georgia and I went home, Georgia went back to the office while Claire and I went home.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I cursed last week or what? I feel like I'm not in control of my life last week. My aunt and grandma are in the hospital and my brother is still the same old self, i.e. troublesome as usual. My parents are always at odds especially when it comes to money. Salary of my father didn't stretch out that much since there are plenty of bills to pay in addition to the food expenses due to my aunt and grandma's hospitalization. I wish I am a millionare, billionare even&nbsp;so that I'll handle all expenses. But what could I do except help in some small way. That is why I decided to go home to Bacolod and settle some matters. Hopefully, my supervisor will allow me to have a 1week vacation. Wish me luck!!!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday(Sunday, July 25) was a very frustrating and tiring day to me. Saturday night, I slept around 2am and woke up to Andy's text that he's online around 5:50am. So I hurriedly got up and went to the internet cafe to chat with him. Unfortunately, the yahoo messenger was acting up. I was really pissed. I have only one hour to chat with Andy and the damn computer was not cooperating with me. I did everything from downloading yahoo messenger and reinstalling it to restarting the server and other computers as well. All to no avail, good thing was I did connect and we chat for about 5-10min only. It was a big disappointment. So I went home listless and hoping that we'll do better later when we chat again around 2am(phil time, 1pm u.s. time).    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;I slept most of day so that I'll be awake when Andy and I have our chat. I had a problem that time since all the internet cafe in my subdivision were closed by 2am. So I text Otep if I could use his account and laptop. I couldn't use his laptop but the account I could. So before I can text Ria or Arlene if I could borrow their laptop I inquire with Nang Ilongga if they have telephone.They have! and they have internet connection too only it's prepaid. So I ask permission from her employer if I could use their computer at 2am and she agreed. As night rolled by, I always watch the clock as to what time is it. I watched Horse Whisperer to make me awake...lol... By the time 1:30am arrived, I was all set. I called and called Nang Ilongga for about 10min before she woke up and opened the door for me. I was embarrased to wake her up but I told Andy I will make a way. By the time I turned on the computer it was 10min to 2am. So I immediately connected to the dial-up server and there my problems began. It was a nightmare!!! I hurriedly login to ym thru my mobile so that Andy will see that I'm there. Unfortunately, whatever I did still I can't connect to Mozcom. It was a torment to be there and not be connected. It was 2:45am in the morning, I haven't been connected, I still have to work tomorrow and I didn't have a chance to chat with Andy!!! grrrrrr!!! So with a heavy heart and head(since it was pounding with lack of sleep) I had to call it quits and try again next time.. =(    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully this week will be much much better!!! I'll do better next time. And hope to God these trials, hardships and&nbsp;disappointments, I too shall pass and learn from it. As long as I live, there's still hope...So don't give up Maila!!! Be strong and smile always!!! =)

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank God it's Friday! Last working day of the week, I can't wait to sleep until 11a.m. I feel pressured today. We'll have an interview with Mr. T together and I'm stressed out as usual. Besides that, I have a headache. I slept around 2a.m. again this morning and had 4hours of sleep. My head feels like cotton, I have a cold and my body feels like lead. Please bear with me, ok? Am I sick or what? Maybe lovesick,eh? ;p Not really, I'm a little bothered that Andy haven't emailed me for the past 3days. I know he's busy but I'm annoyed with him. Maybe we're just really friends and I'm making something out of his emails and chat. I don't want to feel this way with somebody who is thousand of miles away from me. We may never meet in person... =(   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is my sister's birthday, she's 25!!! I'm so happy for her and her accomplishments. I wish that all her dreams come true...Love you sis!!! Thank you for being a wonderful sister to me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, I had the "TALK" again with my brother. He disobeyed me again. So I lectured him on what he should and should not do. I pray to God that what I said to him is imprinted in his mind. Hoping that he'll try one day at a time to change his ways. That's all I ask. It's never easy avoiding addiction, may it be computer games, drugs or anything. But with time and perseverance on his part, he can do it. I just pray that he'll do it and make me proud of him... =)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, my plans for this weekend is not really that hectic. I'll accompany my sister to Bridges to have her hair cut. We'll see what happens if what my friends say is true. Also, Andy and I have a chat date on Sunday 6a.m. so I had to sleep early on saturday night. Then again maybe not since he didn't email me confirming our chat. Hoping I have a good and stress-free this weekend.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAPPY WEEKEND TO ALL!!! =)

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life yesterday started with the usual rush to the office with 4minutes to spare. Traffic as usual in the Talamban-Banilad area was heavy. I don't where all those cars came from but it seems like 7:30am is the time everyday goes to the office, school, etc. So far I didn't got late for this week so that's good news. =)    &nbsp;  10:40a.m.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just had our brunch in the canteen.&nbsp;Of course, eating took about 10-15minutes but chatting with each other took&nbsp;even longer.&nbsp;As a result, we even had a bet for P10.00 as to what is the national sport of Philippines. Ria, Arlene and I bet for "sepak takraw" while the rest of the gang go for "Sipa". Unfortunately, we lost the bet. =(    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lunchbreak arrived and I napped for about 35minutes. I slept&nbsp;around 3a.m.&nbsp;the day before and my body feels weak. Didn't have that good sleep since the chair was uncomfortable as a bed. That's ok at least I felt a little bit refreshed with my nap. ;)    &nbsp;  1-5p.m.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With nothing to do, spending 8hours of my time in the office was pure boredom. Though, I've spent some of them studying Nihongo and Java. I have an interview on Friday with Mr. T and I'm still not ready. Have to try though otherwise I'll always regret not trying the best that I can. By the time 3p.m. arrived, I'm hungry for food. We will&nbsp;worked out after work so I had to take my early dinner in the canteen... Had a bet again with Arlene daring her to ask Jason for a date. The bet was P50 we'll pay her if Jason agree and if she lost then she'll pay us P50 each. Of course, provided that Jason knows nothing of our dare. It's a fifty-fifty chance so let's wait and see. ;p    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exercise is good for the body." That is what you'll always hear from people. Easier said than done since&nbsp;exercise takes a lot of effort from oneself. Hip-Hop&nbsp;is the best aerobics&nbsp;for me. Especially with Lisa intructing&nbsp;us. She's only 19yrs old and doing great as an instructor at Slimmers. I stayed for an hour at Slimmers then it's time for Claire and I to go home and watch the Amazing Race. I did arrived on time for the start of the program. The only disappointing thing last night was my brother. He disappointed me again. Are teenagers really that hardheaded? Is it me or him? Am I not understanding enough or patient enough for him to be this way always? All I ask of him was to get his certification of grades from USC so that we'll be refunded of our expenses in his school. He's so irresponsible. He's our only brother and he's supposed to be responsible, dependable and independent. Hopefully, he'll someday&nbsp;change for the better. Finally, I slept around 2a.m. again...

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Reading Ria's thoughts on "The ONE" gave me some affirmation to some of my realizations. Happiness should come from within. To make someone happy, one should also be happy. Being with someone should be for all the right reasons. I may rant and rave sometimes of not finding "The ONE" yet but I don't lose hope that I'll find him maybe&nbsp;not now but&nbsp;in the future. I still have nightmares of going through the same experience of losing someone you love more than&nbsp;life itself,&nbsp;but one must make a choice to be&nbsp;strong or be a coward. I chose to love again. Love, true love is never easy. Obstacles are constantly in the way but worth it in the end. That is what I'm hoping for, to be with someone who'll love me and I love in return. So, to all those people out there looking for "The ONE", good luck and don't give up!!!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mornings are usually hectic for me. This morning is it! I had to sprint from the construction site near my office to the office log in machine with 5minutes to spare. I had the bad luck of riding a jeepney who had a flat tire 50m away from my destination. It's a bright day since Andy wrote me another email. He always make me smile whenever I read his emails. He told me about his day and what is happening with Hailey. I've already replied to his email so we'll see if he'll email me back tomorrow... =)      &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21minutes more to go and it's time to get off from work. It's been a little bit busy afternoon for me with the meetings, appointment and other stuff. Time flies so fast when you're doing something. That is what I want to do, to do something. Perhaps it's time for me to take stock of everything that is happening in my life and do&nbsp;something about it. Don't worry I'm getting there, just be patient with me...    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *-*-*-*-*   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as i recall my life   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i wonder if i did right   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people i met   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; places i've been   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etched in my mind and within.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *-*-*-*-*  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was listening to the song of Gary V. "How did you know" at lunch break, I wish I could fine someone that could fill the empty space in my heart. Things I want to change with my lost loved one that I could never bring back. Chance lost and hopefully someday be found again.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday is the start of week I'm so not looking forward too! I got in for work around 9:33am so it was undertime. It was ok, its the first undertime I got these last 2weeks.It's a feat!!! Then the usual checking of emails, deleting emails and writing to my blogger. Nothing interesting to tell... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's 4:53pm...I'm so bored!!! I want to do something. Something exciting! Not to study Java, C++ or Nihongo but to go out of here. Maybe I'll write a poem. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - Mine - - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is like a river &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free&nbsp;but obstacles in the way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunrise, sunset &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like my life's high and low. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help me find myself &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I'm meant to be...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why I write this one. At least I feel fine already. Something to remember this boring day I spent in the office. =)

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is saturday! Andy woke me up early in the morning!!! Could you believe it. 6a.m. and he sent me a message saying hey! he's online. I wasn't expecting it since he didn't reply to my last email. Men are so inconsiderate sometimes! Still he's Andy so I was excited.hehehe...I had to knock on all the internet cafe at my village before I found one. It was embarrassing but what the heck, I had to chat with him otherwise I'll spend plenty of money sending text to him thru my mobile. In the space of 20min. we talked. Unfortunately, he had to go since the library is closing. I wan't to rant and rave that time is too short but don't have the right really. My sister even text me where I was since when she came home from work at 6:30a.m. I wasn't in bed. Hahaha! So our chat was over and I went home and slept til 10:30a.m.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was late going to Ayala to meet with Arlene and Ria. We took our lunch at Manpuku(again :) ) and after that went to the jeepney station. Our ride took about 40min just going to Gaisano Mactan. It was a hot and sunny day. Brrr, the sun just sting at times. Then had our shopping galore at Gaisano. You could not believe how many blouses I bought in Mactan. It seems like a lot. I can't believe I only&nbsp; spend around 800pesos all in all for all my purchases. I bought 5blouses, 1 sleeveless shirt and 1 flimsy blouse.It was tiring but fun. Had a great time trying out clothes. Even the salesgirls were ignoring us. It took us about 3.5hours of roaming around the women's department. Then had a snack at Greenwich, ate a pizza and drunk iced tea. Finally it's time to go back so we rode by taxi and I got off Mabolo since Jan and I have to meet.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan and I was supposed to meet by 6p.m. near the entrance of Ayala. As usual he was late again!!! Grrrr, aren't Europeans supposed to be on-time all the time. Then he arrived by 6:20p.m. and we went to the cinema to watch movie. Unfortunately, the movie houses are closed til 9p.m. since Mike Francis will have&nbsp; a show in the activity center. So we decided to go to SM to watch a movie there. Conversing with Jan is so frustrating at times since he won't talk. So I decided to keep silent and wait for him to make the effort of talking to me. It works! hehehe...He's trying to converse with me. It was a start I guess. By 7:20 p.m. we went inside Cinema 3 showing "Around the world in 80 days". He's the one that paid for the movie of course but I offered to buy my own ticket. hehehe...Had a great time watching the movie. Though Jan and I didn't talk much. What is there to talk about anyhow.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 9:15p.m. the movie ended and I was so hungry. So I ask him if he wants to eat. I was even thinking of treating him out just so we could eat. But all the fastfoods are closed so he ask me if I want to go to Colon. I was afraid at first since I haven't been to Colon at night but I'm hungry so I agreed. It's funny just thinking about it now, he was trying to talk to me but I'm not really listening to him. People are staring at us in the jeepney wondering what's our relationship with each other. It was weird. Then we got off near Gaisano Metro and ate at Jollibee. I had spaghetti and coke. During dinner, he talk about his journeys to Malaysia, Thailand, Spain and even England. I ask him about his family but not much. I only know that he hasn't been home in 5years. He told me he's planning on going to Bohol and was wondering where he could store some of his stuff. So being a good Samaritan I offered to store his stuff, no need to pay me. So we agreed to see each other again on Monday in Ayala. After that he accompanied me to the jeepney stop and I'm at a loss whether to shake his hand, kiss him on the cheek or what. So I just pat him in the arm and told him thank you, see you Monday and get on 13C jeepney. What a night!!!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My alarm went off at around 5:55am. Andy and I will have a chat by 6a.m. so I woke up early. He sent me a message that he's online at exactly 6a.m. so I had to walk fast to go to the internet cafe. I had a great time chatting with him even if it was too short. We talk about the weather, dating, his family and other stuff. I had a great time chatting with him. Next week Sunday(phil. time), we'll chat again so I'll look forward to it. I was supposed to post my blog after Andy and I chat but I erased my draft so I decided to go home and get some sleep... =)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept till 11a.m. until my sister woke me up so we'll have our brunch. I was lazy to get up but I got up anyway. My siblings and I watch TV until 3 p.m. I have to go to SM to look for Juliet's gift. I was lazy again to go to SM but I have to go otherwise Shermin and I won't have a gift to give to Juliet. So by 4p.m., we went out of the house to go to SM. SM was packed! Plenty of people around. My sister is sleepy that she gets cranky at times. Then I had to buy her stuff like lip balm from body shop and sandals from artwork as part of her birthday gift. She said I had to give her other stuff besides the one that I bought her!!! She wants it to be a surprise, you see, so I'm at a loss as to what to give her this coming Friday July23.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had our dinner at Jonie's and as usual I didn't consume all of my chicken. Then we had to look for the gift of Juliet but the maglite and victoria secret was not suitable with the budget and the scent so I decided to forgo my buying and ask for the opinion of Shermin the next day. As we got out from SM, the soil was damp from rain and my sister wants us to go home by taxi, so taxi it is. By 8:20p.m. we arrived from home and got ready for bed. I read some books while watching TV until 11p.m. and dream of having a good week ahead of me... =)

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday is here again!!! It's my favorite day of the week. Today I had my usual morning meeting, get&nbsp;in late again for the 3rd time this month. I have to not get in late before the month ends otherwise I'll get a written warning this time. Arlene is still not talking to us but we decided to talk to her sort of like an open forum to clear things up.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time 5p.m. arrived, I'm excited and apprehensive of what will our open forum result to. I received an email from Jan yesterday asking me to meet him again.I'm a little hesitant of meeting him since I don't know what to talk to him about. He's not that talkative when we meet and I get bored with him. =) Still I have to try it the last if we have something in common so I sent him a text saying I'm free on Saturday and he text back that he'll contact me on the same day. Back to the forum, we started our forum at around 6p.m. it was awkward at first since it feels like we were high school again. But once Monette started to ask Arlene what went wrong, we started to open up to her. I found out of her feelings toward us, why she won't talk to us and what's the problem. It was simply a good thing to have that forum otherwise we won't know what she's thinking and feeling. I just hope that whatever we told her she got it in good faith. We just want her to be happy, independent and strong to whatever problems she may encounter in the future. The end result is we got our friend back and hopefully it stays that way... =)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 7:30p.m. we were really hungry so we went to Neo Neo to have our dinner. It is my first time to eat there and plenty of people I know say that the food is great. Though the service is very bad, the food is good. We have our fill and talk simultaneously while eating. I feel like I really belong to this group. It's the first time that I found really good friends that I can tell them anything that I feel. Good thing, don't you think? Well after that we had to go to SM to watch Liberated 2. I was hesitant of watching that kind of movie since I know that it won't have a good story behind it. But the stores are closed by 9pm so we watch the movie anyway.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liberated 2 was a flop. There were some scenes that we could make fun of but in its entirety, I didn't like it that much. Good thing though is we watch the movie at the balcony even if our ticket was only 50.00...Had a good laugh at it too. The company then decided to have coffee but change it at the last minute. We went to C24 near Lahug overpass by 11p.m. I bought Sprite and we sat around a table outside the store. Had a good laugh talking with each other really. Ria was the life of the party so to speak... She's really good at joking and all the things she says are so funny I had a hard time breathing because I was laughing so hard. hahaha!!!&nbsp; By 12:30p.m. we decided to go home and Claire and I went home by taxi....

          This is my first post to my blogger. =) It's funny how simple things can go wrong in just a split second. I told myself when I get up this morning that "Today is our badminton day. We will have lots of fun...".      I got up early this morning since I don't want to be late again for the 3rd time this month. Traffic is very heavy near Talamban and Banilad area. It took me about 25minutes to get out of countrymall. Good news for me, I didn't got in late. =) Then the usual morning meeting, met my sister outside the office for a bit, and check my mails for the day. I received plenty of text messages today since I logged in to yahoo messenger using my sms.Unfortunately, no email from Andy... I even had a chat with Pipo whom I haven't heard of in months since he resigned from NEC. We had plenty to talk about work, married life and his life in Manila. So far so good.      By 10 'o clock, Ria,Claire,Georgia,Arlene, Mau and I went to the canteen to have our brunch. While we were waiting for our turn to be served, we talked about our plans on playing badminton in abellana. I don't know what happened but I guess she has gone mad again. It's difficult to adjust to somebody that act all the time like a child. Have to take responsibility of your actions that's why it's called LIFE. We usually go together to the restroom after lunch break to brush our teeth, but she didn't she just passed me on my way as if i'm nothing. Well i'm through pampering her, if she wants nothing to do with me and throw away our friendship for 4years then it's her loss not mine. I'm at the end of my limit. =(       Around 9p.m., I had the TALK with my brother again. His grades and bag are nowhere to be found and his attitude is getting out of hand. Luckily, he told me why he didn't get his grades, he was afraid he didn't pass all his subjects. Well, all in all my evening was fine, my relationship with my brother so far is doing ok.

           Today is wednesday, August 18, 2004. Amazing race will be shown on AXN at 8p.m. this evening. It is a race around the world where there are 13couples competiting. The first team to arrive at the last destination wins! I guess life is like one amazing race. You could be eliminated early in life or you could be the winner. Either way it depends on what you decided as the game goes along. My life was like that. Sometimes I fall but I've learned to picked myself up. Sometimes I lose but I value the lessons I learned. It's an everyday learning process.      It's been a week since the last time I visited my parents. It's lonely being without them but I manage. I have my friends who are always there to cheer me up. My sister went home to our parents' for a week. She'll be returning to Cebu on Monday. Then my brother will be going home for a week after my sister arrives since they have no school due to Intramurals. That's a good thing us visiting our parents. It'll also be the time to visit our grandmother who is sick. She's at home and doing better now but she still needs help for her respiration and that's where the oxygen tank comes in. Sometimes I feel bad for her since she's suffering so. I sometimes wish that God would take her that way she'll be at peace. But whatever God plans for her, it has a purpose... =)           A lot of things had happened last week. I got news that my niece of few days died due to respiratory failure. It's a loss for us especially that she was our only niece on my mother side. Wherever you are little Samantha, be happy and be an angel and look after your family. On the other hand, my friends and I went to see a concert of Freestyle with the special participation of Ogie Alcasid and Jaya. It's a great night to go out partying. Had a great time with my friends. We ate our dinner at Gerry's. After the concert, we went to TimeZone and as usual we played Daytona Racing. It was fun especially that some of our officemates(men) joined the game. We also played basketball shootout and Dance Revo. Had a good game of basketball with my highest score of 36.           Yesterday was hip-hop day at Slimmers world. Arrived at the gym around 630pm. Had some warmup exercises before Lisa(our intructor) arrived. I always enjoyed hip-hop since you're dancing and exercising at the same time. It's fun eventhough some of the steps were difficult but fun nonetheless. By 8p.m. aerobics ended and we were fooling around kicking as high as we could based on the level of the hand we set. Claire went down in a bang!!! lol...She slipped on the floor as she tried to touch the hand of Georgia with her feet. Owwww!!! I got scared since I thought she hurt her wrist but the good thing is the only got hurt is her butt and she was embarrassed... =) After that, we went to the Foodcourt to have some dinner and talk some more. I always wonder why it seems you can't run out of things to talk about with your friends. I mean we see each other everyday at work but whenever we got together there's still something to talk about. Well, I guess that's what friends are for...          Today I got an email from Andy. It's great hearing from him again after a week of no communication. I'll be sending a reply to him after I finished writing to this blog. Today is also our bloodletting day. I'll be donating blood. They said it's also another way of being healthy and I could help someone with my blood. :) Well, that's all for now. Till next blog. =)

           It's been a long time since my last post. It's been a long week for me especially with my grandmother being admitted again to the hospital due to pneumonia. Had a scare too especially with her delicate heatlh but thankfully she's now doing fine and the doctors' said she has clear lungs. I'm not so sure when she'll be able to transfer to a regular room since she's at the ICU right now. Today is sunday and it's my last day here in Bacolod City. I'm not so sure when will I be coming back but hopefully it's soon. Had to go to Rolling Hills to visit Pio before I go back to the hospital. Just a quick visit to say goodbye for now.          My cousins, father, uncle and I visited my uncle's last night. Had a rough ride ahead especially with the rain. Had a good soak too with the OMC vehicle overtaking us and had me and my father splashed with road water in the process. ugh!!! It was gross. We had to go home to our house in Mountainview and take a bath before going to my uncle's place. Still it was nice to see them and had a visit. Going back to the hospital was slow with me as the driver since my father had to many to drink. We even had to leave my uncle at his brother's place since he's drunk and all he did was sleep the whole time. So the four of us went back to the hospital to drop off my cousins and pick up my aunts. I was even supposed to sleep in the guest room at the hospital but due to my father's drunkeness, I had to be the one to drive so that leaves my cousins to take watch at the hospital. But all in all, it was fun...          Well that's all for now. My cousin and I had to search for napoleones since my girlfriends ask me to bring them some. I'm not so sure if I'll be able to buy some but I'll try. See you again next time when I get back to Cebu...      P.S.        Jan text me the other day saying that he's back in Cebu. He ask me out to dinner and later on pick his stuff at my place. I told him we'll meet on Tuesday since I'm tired on Monday. I haven't told him yet of the time and place so maybe I'll do that later...

           Hello Blog. I'm here again and right now I'm sitting at my cousin's computer here in La Carlota. It took us about 1.5hours from Bacolod and it was raining as we entered the city. Driving was slow especially with the bad road but we had no idea since it wasn't raining when we drove from Bacolod. But before we came here, we visited Pio's grave at Rolling Hills Cemetary. It's always saddens whenever I go there but I try to be cheerful and be thankful for the gift of life. Anyway, traffic was bad especially that it's peak hour. I was so nervous about my driving but thankfully I get off from there... hehehe... It seems like a long way coming here but at long last we arrived around 11a.m. here.

           here i am sitting in JRS internet cafe, it's sunday around 3:35pm in the afternoon. too many events has happened in my life since i came to bacolod. saturday 4a.m., as i sat in the bus waiting for the time to travel to bacolod city, i recalled the happenings the night before and recalled that i had a great time with my girlfriends. we ate at Shakey's and boy we really had a great time eating cheese pizza, mojo's and shakey's combo meal. lots of laughter and fun. afterwards, we went to see a movie, "Ella Enchanted". Anne Hathaway is really fit to be a princess. the movie was funny, enchanting and had a little bit corny on the side. hehehe =) as usual, after the movie we went to East West to have some drinks and later on went to Time Zone to play Daytona's Car Racing. I was 1st place 2 times in a row...        the whole trip going to my parents' was a blur. i was asleep the whole time except for the occasional stopover where we ate our breakfast. around 12:30pm, i met with my cousins Diane and Angela as I got off from the bus. my parents weren't there to meet me since they have a Braveheart meeting at Bacolod pavillion from 8-5pm. Lunch was great since Mama prepared my favorite foods,i.e. adobong manok, shrimp, tinoling manok. It was nice eating foods prepared by Mama... =) In the afternoon, I spent it mostly sleeping until it was time to meet Pio's family to have dinner. It's Nang Ging2x's birthday and I invited them to dinner together with my family. We ate at Buto't Balat. It's the usual filipino cuisine, there's some Lechon Kawali, Sinigang na baboy, bulalo, camaron rebosado and fried chicken. unfortunately, Daddy and Mommy(Pio's parents) weren't able to come due to car trouble and bad health. still it was fun seeing Ng Ging2x and Ng Neneng. We haven't seen each other in months.       Sunday... I spent it sleeping again and around 12noon, my cousins and I went to Bacolod Pavillion to watch my parent's dance the Rigodon dance, part of the program of Couple's for Christ. They were great. Unfortunately, they only got second place but I don't know why they lost. Around 2:30pm, we went home but we got off in Robinson's to do some shopping. We dine out again and ate at Robinsons till it's time to go home. It was a great week... =)
