         Music:    Fiona Apple - Shadowboxer    Mood:    Bored      Yes, yes, I've been sucked into that large group of people who writes down every freaking thing that happened in their day and then posts it on a website for the world to see. What can I say? It's summer, I was bored today.  My sister took the car to Ontario to take her BAR EXAM! That leaves Ryan and me stuck at home with no car... Eh, we're computer geeks anyway. We dont' need to go anywhere. No one's online. I'm so incredibly bored. Oh well...      X  o  X  o

         Music:   Ashlee Simpson - Shadow     Mood      :   Tired              OMG so much to write and I'm tired so I don't know if I can do it LOL!  Ok well yesterday was pretty tight.  Lisa and I went shopping for a few hours in the morning but all we bought were 2 coffees lol then the whole family went up to my aunt and uncle's house.  We just stayed for a few hours and that was pretty boring so we left at like 6.      Then the "fun" started LOL!  Lisa, Ryan, and I went to this party in the valley.  It was Ryan's aunt and uncle's house.  They have 2 kids.  Russell is like... well I don't know how old he is but his friends are young.  And his sister Emily who is one of my new favorite people.        Emily is like the awesomest chick ever!  She's only 19 but a junior in college.  She goes to school year round so she's gonna graduate a year early.  And with the straight A's that she has, she want to go to Harvard Law School.  And if she gets in there, shes going to wait to go, and go to film school for 2 years.  Then law school for 3 years.  Then she wants to become and entertainment lawyer.  And then a screenwriter (love writing , majors in English).  Shes already working on a film story and she eventually wants to write a novel.  So cool right?  To make her even cooler, she plays guitar and has an album.  She's not Avril Lavigne or anything but hey, how many of you have your own album.  She's cute too.  Skinny, blonde hair, Ashlee Simpson bangs that I want, nice style.  I'm soooo jealous!  But anyways, back to the party...      Ok so this party is all Russell's friends.  Just a bunch of drunk people basically.  Tons of smoking, underage drinking... and would a valley party be without some pot?  We got that too LOL!  Well as soon as they started bringing the pot out we figured it was time to go HaHa!  Got home about 11 last night and then stayed up looking at cars!!  Go here:       Ok well today was boring, nothing to write about lol!             X  o  X  o
