       We finally have our new web-site!!!!    The lowdown    The main link is http://www.lavweb.tk .  The site is mostly a portal, which opens up to introductory information  that isn't too reliant on knowledge of micro-nations in general.  The most exciting part is the forum, which can be accessed from the  main page.  Most of all...Lakturui!  -----Xon

      Lavalon now has its own Web Space. It has been registered in Lavalon's  name, although e-mails from HostCubix will go to my e-mail address,  that part can easily be changed.  Lavalon is now well on its way to having an all-new website. I have  just logged into our new web space, which is being provided by the  EXCELLENT HostCubix.com. Not only is this web hosting, but web services  as well. We will have 50 megs and e-mail adresses also.  Over the next weeks I will keep everyone updated on the website  developments.  Hopefully Lavalon will end up with its own domain name. But before we  do that, I've been thinking about Lavalon's name sounding a little too,  lets just say "lavender". That's right, all citizens can now suggest a  new name for Lavalon. A really cool name might get us many more  citizens.  Xon

      This is somewhat of a long post, so don't feel rushed to reply to   everything....  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------ ON MY BLOG SITUATION:  Hi, this is Xon (Matthew M.). I finally have a Blogspot account I can   log in to, which is "trxon". BUT, I notice I am not listed as a contributor, so all you have to I   guess is add "trxon" to the list. Whenever I click on "Post to this Site", it just takes me straight to   my blog control panel, which has nothing to do with the Lavalon blog.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------ ON THE NEW ACTS:  Also, I would like to announce that I HEREBY DECLARE the following   drafted acts as Acts (actual law):  1. The Cultural Enhancement Act. The full text of this Act, which has   been modified from the earlier draft and is /now/ found at a different   link, is at the following address:   http://tbctv.3321871.tripod.com/cultureAct.html .  2. POTA, the Patents, Ownership, and Trademarks Act. This Act's text is   found at the following address:   http://tbctv.3321871.tripod.com/ownershipAct.html  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------  ON THE WEB SITE SITUATION:  You will notice that both of these Acts are hosted, temporarily, on   space I have donated to Lavalon. Until I gain full access to this blog,   I would like for someone to change the link for the Cultural   Enhancement Act to the tripod one. Unfortunately, Tripod is now my only   web server because the free ones I get by "knowing the right people"   always go offline after about a year (such as expunged core, which   won't let be log on with FTP).  The Blog is a very excellent resource for Lavalon. However I realize   that blogs alone won't keep Lavalon alive long term, and a real website   is necessary. So I will be investigating the possibility of purchasing   a domain name for Lavalon and finding some better web space. At least   from that, we can have a simple portal web page directing users to the   Blog or any of the old forums that we have or the New Forum that I hope   will come soon.  If anyone has ad-free hosting with FTP access and one would like to   donate a portion to Lavalon, that would be excellent. Just contact me   at mrtn332@mail.ru . I do not live in Russia.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------  ON ACT PUBLISHING:  All published Acts, except ones that result in a veto override in the   General Assembly (as the Executive Branch cannot dictate the form of   those Acts), shall from now own resemble the two Acts that have been   approved today in these specific attributes:  1. Background must be blue. 2. Flag. Lavalon flag must be displayed somewhere on the page. 3. Text must be white. 4. Abstract. This describes the document's overall structure and goals. 5. Text. Text should be in a separate section and, preferably, have   some sort of hierarchal formatting of its elements.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------  Regards,  Xon

      I, Zachary Klaas, President of Lavalon, hereby appoint Matthew Martin (Xon) to be the Chief of Staff of my Presidential Cabinet.  He shall have the power to act on my behalf, with all my authority as President, except as countermanded by myself, or in cases where I choose to exercise directly rather than delegate my authority.

      To everyone in Lavalon:  I would like to place on our agenda the question of what to do about our forum situation.  The forums designed by Panevi, our current Vice-President, were not working.  That was why I invited people to try this web log instead.  Now it is becoming clear that the web log is not working either.  I am now looking for alternative solutions.  It has been brought to my atention that finding such solution is considered to be entirely within my mandate as the President.  I disagree.  It needs to be within all of our mandates as citizens.  I need suggestions.  If we are looking for another forum server, we already know that Proboards have fairly decent forums servers.  The Republic of West Overbrook Proboard server we used temporarily seems to work for users, as does the International Association Proboard server.  Would Lavalon citizens consider moving once again? (I know this blows, but obviously we've got to fix this problem, and it's affecting the progress of Lavalon, so time is of the essence.)  Let me know here, and we'll move from this blog to some new location.  Help me fix this problem and it will get fixed.  Zachary Klaas President of Lavalon

      The link on the left that refers to the "Lavab Language Tutorial" is a  bad link. Its my fault, or rather the fault of my FTP client--which  doesn't want to upload a PDF. So, I have uploaded the tutorial as an  HTML file, but as a result of this some of the formatting has been  lost. The link to the tutorial is:  http://www.expungedcore.net/mattm/me/ltutor.html .  Also I have finally drafted the Cultural Enhancement Act 2004  that--because of its very nature of extending and codifying the  President's cultural authority in Amendment One of the  Constitution--needs to be approved by the President into law. The link  to the draft is:  file:///Users/matthewm/Documents/Lavalon/cultureAct.html . As far as  the future of Lavalon goes, this is important legislation. It restores  some of the traditions of the Sovereign Principality, and provides a  way to encourage new ones. There is a provision for a "Lavalon Day", as  well.  And, if you want to see what the Cultural Enhancement Act will offer  immediately..take a look at the University of Lavalon page:  http://www.expungedcore.net/mattm/me/college.html .

      	Lavalon culture was obliterated along with the monarchy. It was a   necessary exchange: democracy for despotism. But the basis of Lavalon,   the reason it was created, the customs it evolved during the Sovereign   Principality, ceased to apply to Lavalon as the once had. 	Now that our government-revolution has taken place, I would like to   move to restore Lavalon's culture and history. I recommend reading the   following thread at the website, which gives important details of how   our cultural-revolution will take place: 	http://www.lavalon.t9x.com/republic/index.php?  option=com_simpleboard&func=view&catid=2&id=83  Regards,  Xon

      I am currently shopping around, as the International Association Interim Prime Minister, for a Minister of Internal Affairs.  This person would be responsible for making sure the internal processes of the IA are accessible, understandable and workable for people, and to ensure that documents produced by the IA are useful for its Citizens, Associates and Councils (Member Nations).  Now that Mr. Zancer is Lavalon's IA Senator (and given that the Upper House of the IA is not yet very active), I wonder if he would also like to be the Minister of Internal Affairs...  Nate's already the External Affairs minister, and I suspect I will want to appoint Xon to a new Ministry dealing with his planned IA Currency system.  And I'd basically like to ensure Mr. Z has something to do, since he's been so active thus far and I hate to see a willing hand with nothing to do.  :)

      I had the chance to write a very persuasive letter to someone enquiring  about Lavalon at Breudwydd's web-site. Knowing that what the poor soul  would receive would have been propagandistic slander against the  republic, I offered my own reply. This letter is a classic, and feel  free to quote it when responding to questions about Lavalon:  "President Kelly,  For a period of about two months, former Sovereign Prince Kieran was  unable to administer Lavalon because of a computer problem. At the  time, the Sovereign Prince was virtually all-powerful in matters of  decision making, and at that time his decisions were lacking. Lavalon  was losing activity; it was falling-apart.  With the support of the webmaster, and several new citizens, Lavalon  was able to be revived. A Provisional government was set up and a  Constitutional Convention was held. Lavalon was transforming into a  Republic. Meanwhile, Kieran returned. At first he was neutral on the Transition.  He was neither for nor against, the change in government. However, as  fallen leaders often do, Kieran later moved to protect his waning power  by calling the Transition illegitimate. He publically derided the  Provisional Government, and then did the same for the new Republic  government. Sometime, in the midst of debates at micro-nations.org, the Kingdom of  Breuddwyd was set up. The Kingdom of Breuddwyd is an absolute feudal  monarchy with Kieran Bennett as its head.  Now, up until this time, Kieran Bennett was a legal citizen of the New  Republic. A crony of his, George Tsilis, was also a legal citizen. The  Republic was very forgiving, and hoped for the best. After attempts by  the Republic's Executive, Judicial, and Legislative branches to  reconcile failed, a suggestion was made for an International Tribunal  composed of judges from several micro-nations. This attempt, which  possibly could have spelled doom for the Republic, was also refused. I,  as Chief Justice, had no choice but to declare Kieran Bennett and  George Tsilis traitors of the Republic and to remove their  citizenships.  In my action of naming them traitors, I encountered substantial  criticisism from within Lavalon's Republic. The new President of  Lavalon, Zachary Klaas, publically reprimanded me for my judgements.  The issue simmered after that, and we watched carefully to see what the  external reactions, if any, would be. To our surpise and pleasure,  Lavalon benefited, though did suffer some losses. For example, a  micro-nation known as Gabilonia, hailing from Romania, adopted a policy  of non-association with us. Breuddwyyd established the infamous "f***  the Republic" pronouncement.  Alrodria and Natopia allied themselves  with Lavalon, and other micro-nations offered encouraging words.  Now, Lavalon is on the upswing. We have a fantastic website, and you  can check it out at http://www.lavalon.tk . Many things are planned, including a currency system. I offered my support to the change in government at Talossa /before/ it  occured. Talossa's situation was very much paralell to what occurred in  Lavalon. Even the way in which its provisional government came together  seems similar to what had been Lavalon's situation.  Lavalon is not anti-monarchy. Lavalon does not wish to foster  anti-royalist tendencies, nor proclaim revolutions or coups everyday.  Lavalon simply wants to move in the direction that Kieran once  envisioned for Lavalon: a Lavalon of democratic tendencies. There are  words in Lavalon's own invented language, Lavab, that express these  ideals.  Of Lavalon,  Chief Justice Xon"

      Welcome to the Web Log for the Republic of Lavalon, a small (but growing) micronation located in various places all over the globe, as well as across the internet!  This site has been created to allow Lavalon's citizens, as well as guests, to interact with one another in a free and relatively unfettered net environment.  Lavalonians have had some difficulties interacting with one another of late, given some technical difficulties on the Lavalon forums.  Hopefully, this web log will make it more possible for Lavalonians to interact with fewer obstacles and impediments.  If you're a citizen of Lavalon, welcome to the Web Log!  Take out an account here and post as soon as you have something to say!  Hopefully, we'll have some material built up on this site soon which will interest others who might just be passing by.  If you're just visiting, feel free to drop us a line, and enjoy looking around this site.  Zachary Klaas President of Lavalon
