      I've been looking for a (free) service that will send an email notification when someone posts or comments on this blog, or the Eva Pictures blog.  I thought I had found something yesterday, but ran out of time trying to configure it and couldn't find the link again.  What a maroon.  I'll continue looking.  This isn't a perfect solution, because it only tells you that the site is updated, and not exactly where, but it beats randomly checking with regularity and frantically searching the site for any updates.  With any luck, the notification will include the name of the post, and whether the change is a new post, or a comment to an existing post.  I'll let you know if I find anything, and make it available.

      I've added a second blog (the link  urlLink Eva Pictures  below to the right) to put any photos that you want to share.  This will enable those with the available bandwidth to view and send, without causing this page to take too long to load.  If you'd like to contribute pictures, there is a  urlLink tutorial  that explains how to get the software that you can use to send your local pictures to the picture host, which costs nothing.  The main page will display thumbnails (200k at the smallest setting, which I recommend) with the ability to view a larger version by clicking them.  I've put a couple pictures from our cruise, and will add more as time goes on.  With luck, you'll all be looking at pictures from the race festivities within a day or so of the event itself.  Won't that be fun?

      I had forgotten about the "context sensitive" nature of the ads that show up in Google, until I looked at the top of the main page and saw two ads for rodent removal.  Look at that as a plus or a minus, but I found it amusing in this particular case.  The  urlLink Easy-Set Mole Eliminator  and the  urlLink Rodent Control Products  are waiting for us like an obedient dog.  Or an obedient watch-dog, in this case.  That's probably a topic worth exploring here, or somewhere.  Where do you people stand on this topic, vis a vis expressing yourselves freely in this forum?  Is that enough of a cause for concern to go to a different service?  It's the same technology that Google uses to put ads into your searches: Nobody reads your stuff (presumably; it would be awfully time-consuming), but our commentary is scanned nonetheless.  The article, originally in the Wall Street Journal,  urlLink "My Tivo Thinks I'm Gay"  explores some similar themes, long before Tivo announced that it had access to just how many times you paused and rewound to get a glimpse of Janet Jackson's  urlLink nipple shield .  So the question is, do we don tin foil hats and move on to a forum where we can suffer the illusion of privacy, or lay our thoughts and dreams open for Ashcroft's perusal?

      We returned home, against my better judgement.  A few thoughts:  1) Going to the beach with friends who have a two-year-old in tow, no matter how much you care for the friends, and how good the toddler is, is a  buzzkill .   2) When you're at the beach, a two-year-old child, no matter how badly behaved, can't bring your spirits down very much, especially if you don't have ultimate responsibility for the child.  After all is said and done, you're still at the beach.  3) Going to your own place, knowing where everything is, and having access to all of the alcohol in the owners' closet, makes for a great weekend.  You don't have to go out to for every meal, or even any meal, if you don't want to.  If there is a small child in the area, sometimes, you want to.

      There has been evidence of a rodent intruder in this house for months.  It started with the now renouned Berty Bott's Everyflavor Beans episode in M's bedroom upstairs.  Since that time, droppings have been discovered on at least 4 occasions.  I've promised each time to take more serious action to eradicate the pest, but I never went further than putting out the capture trap that we put down upstairs after the first evidence.  This time, I came home and discovered that a hole had been chewed through a breadsack, and a chunk of the bread eaten.  Droppings were left.  So now that I'm home, had the traps right there, had some peanut butter...I put out 4 traps.  I have to admit a moment of hesitation.  I'm not too keen on discovering the carcass of any animal that was killed by such cruel means, but I really want to get rid of it (them?)

      After  hours  of cajoling, we've decided to leave for the beach tonight, as soon as we can get the girls ready.  This five or six hour drive promises to be an adventure, and I've committed to doing all of the driving.  A few well placed weaves into the rumble strip about midnight should take care of that, though.  We'll be there through next Tuesday, so I hope you all can put something worthwhile in here during that time.  In the meantime, here's a bunny with a pancake on his head.

      I always love it when flock gets their instructions from the pulpit.   urlLink This  is particularly amusing to me, though, as he's working to ensure that the next President of the United States is not Catholic.  What strikes as funny, but not particularly surprising, is the comment from the Catholic District Attorney (is all of this capitalization necessary?) admonishing the Bishop, but only because he's afraid it will impede the ability for Catholicism to grow, and, presumably, get more cash and land.  He doesn't appear fazed by losing his vote to invisible ghosts.   He said he singled out abortion, stem-cell research, euthanasia and gay marriage for criticism because they are "intrinsically evil."     Evil , I tells ya!

      My disenchantment with the current administration has begun to take over more of my personality than I’m comfortable with.  I’ve begun to divide my friends with the same “ urlLink us versus them ” mentality that I believe the Bush supporters do, and I don’t care for that.  While I have a fair number of conservative friends,  I’ve begun to separate myself from Right Wingers with a ferocity that I once reserved for lepers, Amway salesmen and Alabama fans.  While this mentality doesn’t sit well with me emotionally, it does fit within the spirit of my overall  urlLink political convictions , and I think it may be a key to recovering the liberal faction of the political spectrum from the jaws of non-existence.  If we don’t fight the warmongers as if we’re in a war ourselves, we’ll be irrelevant before we know it.  It says something that we have settled on someone as milquetoast as Kerry, when we so recently had someone as dynamic as Clinton to lead the charge.  If Democrats had known at the onset of Clinton’s run what we know now (vis a vis his inability to keep his penis exclusively in his or his wife’s pants), we wouldn’t have even nominated him, and that’s a damn shame.

      On July 3rd, 2004, the Alice-Lee-and-Joe-Joe-Smith family will gather at Ivy's for a reunion.  This year will be the third annual reunion, and we expect the same fun (lots of it) as the years before.  (If Mamaw's funeral counted as a reunion, would this year's be the third or fourth reunion?  Anyway, we can never expect the same fun as provided at  that  event.)  Some of you are unable to attend this year.  I would like to take some stories with me on your behalf, tell 'em around the camp fire.  Eldest son, could you please clear up this confusion in my head about "Yeah, the winners, Bob and Jack!" and Joe Joe creating a tornado with his newspaper to blow down your house of cards?"  Did these incidents occur at the same time?  Was it really our beloved grandfather who crushed your artistic spirit forever?  Gock, how about you?  Besides running from Mamaw after putting out papers, what did you do with your grand folks?  Maybe you weren't running; again, I think I have my stories mixed up.  You and Mamaw were pretty close, if I remember correctly.  And Daya Daya, surely you have the most to tell us, what with being their favorite and all.

      Melanie just spent a week with her aunt Marsha, part of which was spent with uncle Jack, as well (some of you can guess where this is going).  Melanie and I just got back from Wolf Park (more on this at another time), and, when we came back in the house, she saw the printed copy of Joe Conason's interview with President Clinton still lying in my printer, with Bill's face on the front page, and said "ew, Bill Clinton."  I didn't think I could have heard correctly, and asked her what she had said.  She was reluctant to repeat it, but finally did.  She went on about how she didn't like how his wife sat there with a frown, and how he fell asleep and President Reagan's funeral.  I explained to her that he was praying, just as many other people at the funeral were, and she got upset and left the room, as she does many times if she senses I am angry.  For now, I'm just mad as hell.  I'm tempted to say "well, to hell with that, she isn't going to be visiting there anymore, if he is going to be filling her head with lies," but I'll reserve on that until I've had time to calm myself.  Back to your regularly scheduled program.

      Some disappointing news today:  Kristen's EEG this morning indicated seizure activity.  The clinician (nurse, whatever) called this afternoon and gave us a prescription for 5 mg (a very small dosage) of  urlLink Lamictal , (lamotrigine) which, according to that link, is used for "partial seizures", though we've not heard directly from the doctor whether this has been determined to be a partial or a Tonic-Clonic.  We're going in next week to talk to him, and will know more at that time.  In the meantime, we're just doing homework to ensure that we ask the right questions, and taking care of Kristen, which consists of making sure that she gets back the sleep that she lost last night studying for the test.

      1. Buys slew gobs of rib eye steaks, we're talking dozens. 2. Buys gobs, without the slew, of boneless pork chips. 3. Plans to take the rice cooker so he can serve rice with this     stuff. 4. Who knows what all he will have accumulated by the 3rd.  Since I    leave for Ivy's on Wednesday he will have plenty of time alone    to shop.  I think he is excited, although he would never admit to     such a strong feeling. 5. Does his rehab exercises 3 times each day.  He saw a Doctor of    Naturopathy who gave him a list of exercises plus vitamins and     icky stuff to mix and drink each AM. Mostly it is all several     of the B vitamins, which are supposed to make the brain work better.     The exercises are rehab for disequilibrium related to the     labyrinth system.  I looked on the net and they originally     came from an ear, nose and throat, (ENT) doctor who specializes    in this stuff. This is a good thing. Plus some other stuff the    naturopath recommends, such a brushing his body, except for     his abdomen and chest with a little plastic brush each time he    exercises.  I get to do his back and the soles of his feet.    He, your pa, says at least all this will make him able to     function better even while dizzy. His attitude impresses me     and makes me feel something, admiration, humility, guilt,    because I think I know how horribly I would handle what he     is dealing with and how good he would be to me. 6. Enough! See some of you guys late on July 4th.               THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART  7.

      My attention has been called to  urlLink a review  of the re-release of Brian Eno's first four solo "pop" releases in a  urlLink music publication called Pitchfork  of which I had never before heard.  According the this article, significant improvements have been made to the production quality in the remix.  Thanks a friggin' heap.  I think I've earned a gratis copy.  The publication also rubs more salt in my wound that I won't be able to attend the  urlLink music festival  in Austin in September.  This is the second year I've been aware of the show and unable to attend, and it's one of those things that pains one.  Maybe not as much as the Crossroads concert, but still.  Look at that lineup, will you?  I like to think that next year I will be going, but with only two weeks of vacation a year....I have to pick my spots.

      We took Kristen to a Neurologist today, where she got a standard set of "raise this hand, walk on your toes, how may fingers am I holding up?" tests which didn't indicate any problems.  On Friday, we're scheduled to go back for an  urlLink EEG , for which Kristen must be up all night the night before, so that she can sleep for the test.  (Note to self: If I ever have to take this test, there will be no need for such preparation.)  Since the  urlLink cat-scan  didn't indicate anything the day of the seizure, as long as there are no indications that she is predisposed to more seizures from the EEG, that will pretty much be the end of it.  At that point, we're just to keep her out of situations where another seizure would be particularly dangerous (heights, baths, operating heavy machinery) for a few months, and to be aware of the  urlLink proper course of actions  should another one occur (lie her on her side, remove her glasses, keep her from hurting herself).  Should she have another seizure, we'd call the Neurologist, who would prescribe the recommended drugs.  Should she have more than one within a few hours of one another, we'd take her to the emergency room again.  I'll update this when we have results from the EEG.

      Same place as the first one - between the end of the love seat and the wall to the downstairs bedroom.  It may have been there for a couple of days; I had long since stopped checking regularly, in fact, it's probably just my laziness that kept me from picking up all the traps.  Prehaps I should put down some more.

      At the time you officially became  my  Daddy, the occupant of the White House was from Texas, and he was busy shipping teenage kids to a hostile environment in order to prevent the hostile environment´s spread.  How times have changed.  Today, the world is a much more peaceful place.  And nobody would ever dream of putting a Texan in Washington.  But if you think that I sent this letter to pay tribute to fearless leaders of  Daddy during Dip , then think again.  This is a tribute to the concept "daddy", and your having decided several times over to contribute to it.  ...and Happy Fathers´ Day to Gock ´n´ Dew as well, and any of those fellas at Homeland, who, when they´re not looking for potiential clients, remember that they have children as well.  Davidly yours.

      Kristen had a seizure this morning, but is OK now.    She had been at a sleepover last night (and, of course, got very little sleep).  While Dave was taking her home, she was expressing a strong desire to go straight home to sleep.  On the way, she started "twitching".  The twitching got more animated, and she returned a little of the dinner from the night before, and fell asleep in the car.  Upon arrival home, Dave couldn't wake her up to go inside, so he took her to the emergency room, where they hooked her up to an IV and the usual array of monitoring devices, where she got a little sleep, and gradually felt a lot better.    A number of tests were run, including a CAT scan, none of which indicated any problems.  We've been recommended to a Neurologist, and will go as soon as we can get an appointment, but it's not an emergency.  Concensus is that we'll find nothing.  The doctor at the hospital declined to start her on any drugs, citing that 50% of people who have a seizure never have another one, and recommended that we just equip people with whom she'll share time with what to do if it happens again.  The net for the moment is this:  She's just to take it easy and try to get a regular food and sleep schedule.  During the seizure, she pulled a muscle in her back (sore, but not too bad), bit her tongue (kinda nasty), and is sore on her arm where the IV was.  I'll let you know more as we get information from the neurologist.

      I had d/led and installed  urlLink skype  months ago, but didn't have anyone to talk to on it.  Some dude posted a message about wanting to try it out, and gave his username, so I took him up on it.  It totally cool!   The sound quality was much better than any speakerphone I've ever used, and the fact that I'm using the mic in my monitor and the speakers on the side didn't result in feedback the way it did in applications that we tried before.  There was a *little* bit of a noticable...kind of a single duplex phenomenon?...like...conversational sidewalk bumping, but that may just be attributable to the awkwardness of talking to a total stranger.  Of course, McAfee was howling about the app now and then, but I pimped out to the app each time.

      This doesn't solve all of the update problems, because it still doesn't email you when we have updates, but if you're tracking more than one blog, there are ways to keep track of which ones have new posts in them.  I purloined some information from an article in  urlLink Time Magazine on blogs .  See the end of page 4 of the article for more of the pertinent information:   urlLink Kinja.com   "Launched April 1, this is one of the best ways to sample and automatically subscribe to a wide range of blogs."  This one seems to track the changes the best for our needs, based on what little I've done thus far.   urlLink Bloglines.com   "This site lets you organize your blogs in much the same way that your browser sorts its bookmarks."  Unless there is more to this, it appears to be not much more than an alternate front end for the pages, but I'll keep looking to see if there's more than meets the eye.  I'm gonna play with these a little, and see if I can find one suitable.  Among the problems that I already see is that the time stamps aren't updated when a comment is entered into the site, which is probably the most difficult problem that we face here.

      I've been streaming my favorite XM music channel (Channel 51 - XM Music Lab) for about 30 minutes now.  If they let me do this all I want (all the time)...well, it's a reason for joy.  Of course, there are other channels you can stream, too, but who gives a frog's fat ass? ;-)

       urlLink Family values alert!   I don't wish ill on anyone, not even Feedbag.  I have to wonder why Marta doesn't want to deal with him any more, though.  Seems like living with a gasbag would be bad enough.  Is being with a  drug-addled  gasbag just too much to bear?    Or perhaps it's the other way around:  She can't tolerate him when he's not sedated, because for the first time in years, he comes sniffing around for some lovin'.

      I'm sure many of these people saying "great President" really believe it.  They just played a speech clip where he said something about "appealing to your hopes, not to your fears." Give me a friggin' break.  OMG.  They are going on and on about how "courteous he was, even to his opponents".  Please.  "There you go again!"

      That was junior's catch phrase at convention in '00.  Or more likely, something simple he wouldn't botch.  And he delivered it even better than Quayle (the other Jr.) could've, makin' Senior proud (sparing him embarrassment).  Does anyone remember a certain female Air Force fighter pilot, whose marital indiscretions (she wasn't married, he was) were said to have been a representation of the lack of moral leadership by her Commander and Chief?

      We survived the race again, but this time it was more dangerous than it has been since the days when alcohol poisoning was the biggest risk.  The repeated drone of Tom Carnegie's  " There is a tornado warning.  Please leave the stands immediately!"   haunts my dreams still.  I'll get some pictures of the event up on the other site when I get a free moment at home.  Turns out I can't use the utility for that when I'm behind my corporate firewall.  Meh.  Everyone in our party had a good time, and we were probably the only attendees that had the luxury of a steak dinner at home during the break in the middle of the race, even if it cost us a few laps.

      Warning: Many stupid statements and assumptions ahead.    I have recently discovered that we have something of a bat problem. They've probably been there for a year an a half, off and on. We noticed droppings around that time, but I didn't give it much thought, because the droppings were outside of the house. I thought that it might be squirrels or something, but wondered how they were getting to the attic vent, around which there was staining, indicating some activity. The guy painting the house at that time let me know what I was dealing with, when he told me that he saw a dozen or so fly out when he went up to paint that part of the house. I figured that he scared them off, and that was the last we'd see of them. Yeah.    Last weekend, when I noticed that the droppings had returned, and sprayed a hose up toward that attic vent, whereupon about 20 bats flew out, and bat guana ran down the side of the house like Willy Wonka's chocolate river. I returned the next day with my hose, and chased the bats off again. I had hoped that being disturbed like that would cause them to leave for good. Yeah.    The good news is that they're not in the attic; rather, they're hanging out on the outside of the screen, but protected by the slats outside that attic vent window on the side of the house. I went online and ordered some  urlLink Bat-a-Way   to put up in the attic.  The smell supposedly drives the critters away.  We'll see.    The other side is that I hate to drive them away completely, because they keep the mosquito population down (though, if you walk outside our house right now, you can't tell that they're doing a particularly good job). I may put a bat box on one of the trees, and see if I have any luck moving them there.

      Everyone survived the trip to the mountains, and had a great time. I've got some pictures; I'll try to share some of them this weekend. We did lots of loafing, guitar playing, fishing (worm and fake worm drowning), hot tubbing, Password playing, beer and coffee drinking, grilling, red-meat and ice cream eating, swimming, exploring, and arson.     We did some boating, told jokes about boating, and about people who own boats. We made our somewhat annual trip to the drive-in, which is always fun.  Spiderman 2  was a hit.   White Chicks  was, well,  White Chicks .   Gock and I tried to burn down the cabin and surrounding area with our hillbilly pyrotechnics. Thanks go to Gock and Melanie for braving  "One Armed Willie's"  to purchase the implements of destruction.    The cabin was  outstanding . Thanks to Koala for securing it; we hope to have it again next year. It was borderline luxurious: The hot tub was a big hit, the amenities were unbelievable, and there was lots of land to roam around on.

      Forgive me if you've heard or read any of this before.  It's just that I've felt it necessary to update alla y'all on my  travel plans .  As it stands, I still haven't actually "booked" anything, as I didn't want to be stuck with something that I would've had to've changed because of poor planning.  Since I'll be out of town for the next month, at a remote enough location, and occupied with responsibilies of a  urlLink company  nature most of the time, my net access is likely to be sporadic at best.  I depart this weekend, and am to be back  urlLink here  on the 6th of August.   The plan:   to be in Chicago no later than  Barry's wedding on my birthday , which should have me  arriving between the 8th and 13th   to play a couple of  urlLink dates   on or  about the 22nd of August  to either visit Gock, if Gock is da, and then head south; or if he's not there, go straight to the northern mountains of the great state of Georgia  to stay in A&W land for a week or so, whichever comes first  Any plans after this are subject to Carola's schedule, or her ablity to be  urlLink there       in the first place.  Anyway, I'll keep you posted.

      The cabin: A Fisherman's Retreat 650 Blackberry Drive Mineral Bluff, GA  30559 706-374-7740  (from Loving Road/76) 1) Turn right off of Loving Road onto 76 2) Go to the intersection of 515/60.  Turn left (North) onto Hwy 60. 3) Go 1.8 miles to Railroad Avenue, turn left. 4) Go .3 miles to Mountain Rivers Road, turn right.  You will go across a wooden bridge.  Stay on the main paved road for about .5 mile to Blackberry Drive, and turn right. 5) Go .6 mile to the dead end.  There is a gate.  Open the gate and continue to the cabin.  There is a Tica Cabin Rental sign at the driveway.  I'll add a map in here tonight, if I can.  You can pull one up in Mapquest if you need one, also.

      This is probably as good a place as any (if it's not too late) to coordinate the plan for the week, or at least update everyone on schedules, directions, etc.  Craig, Kristen and I will be arriving at Turner Road late Saturday morning.  We can't check into the  urlLink cabin  until 3PM, so we'll go over and pick up the keys from the  urlLink main office  early Saturday afternoon.  I'm trying to get directions faxed to me.  If I get them, I'll post them as a followup.  I'll leave a copy on the kitchen table at Morganton, also.  Daphne will be arriving on Monday late, as she's driving down from the Outer Banks.  We'll all (4) leaving Friday for Norcross, as the kids have to be back at their mom's on Saturday AM.  I'm bringing a tent, an inflatable mattress, and a couple of sleeping bags for overflow of campers.  Does anyone have fireworks?  I don't know what the vibe will be, but it would be nice to have them if we can use them.  Koala dumped the stash that we had in a fit of paranoia.

      I periodically read about "alternate" browsers, like Mozilla, and Opera, and think, "Ah, that's for teh geeks.  It's prolly a pain in the ass, so I won't do that."  This primarily because the people that tell me about the other browsers remind me of the Mac dorks that beat the Apple drum, or the Linux snobs.  Aaaaanywho, I started using Mozilla Firefox and I'm loving it.  It doesn't cost anything, and is *very* easy to download and set up (it can automagically inherit all of your Internet Explorer settings, for example).  There are a lot of cool things in it, like a built in pop-up blocker, but you can discover those on your own.  The reason that I'm bothering to tell you this is that I stumbled upon a feature that I haven't seen documented anywhere, and it's an excellent solution to the problem of knowing when this page is updated.  In Firefox, you can choose the properties of any of your Bookmarks (Favorites) to include a visual and/or auditory notification whenever that page is updated, with an option to automatically open that page.  I know for sure that I got a notification when King of Fools added her last post, and I think, but am not sure, that there is notification when someone adds a comment.  If anyone is interested, download from  urlLink here , where you can get a lot of information on the product as well.

      I´ve finally gotten my ticket.  Barring  a miracle, Crayola won´t be with me, although it´s possible that she may join a leg of the trip.  I´ll be in Chicago from next Wednesday, until about the 22nd.  If Gock is in Indy, I´d like to visit him for a few days:  Do you have any time, at all?  If not I´ll go straight to GA, and maybe see you on my way back, on or about the 5th of September.  I fly back from Chi-town on the 11th.
