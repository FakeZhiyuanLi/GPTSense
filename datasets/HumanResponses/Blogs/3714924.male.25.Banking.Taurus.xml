						   An important part of the retreat is to show the children of the camps that we KPs around the world do in fact love and support them even though we cannot visit them.  So I am asking the attendees of the KOA National Camp in Pennsylvania from July 2-5 to sign cards and write letters of encouragement to the children to show their support.  Since we have been given the use of a large hall at Gandhi Memorial College for free, the costs are limited to transport (renting buses to drive the kids to and from their homes to the college each day, as well as on tours of Jammu city), food (serving lunch and snacks each day) and finally admission to places we visit such as the cinema hall. Raising money for this will not be difficult.   So I am also asking for youth to donate gifts. Depending on how much we raise, this does not need to be limited to the attendees of the retreat, but rather all the children in all the camps (this numbers in the thousands).  The idea behind this is for you to share your own passions with these kids. For example, if there is a book or books or comics that touched you as a kid, or as a teenager why not donate them (well, a hindi version)? If you are a musician why not donate an instrument? If you enjoy painting, why not donate paintbrushes and paper? If you enjoy soccer/football, why not donate footballs? If you want them to listen to music, why not donate radios, or a CD player and burn them some CDs. There are a myriad of possibilities.  To buy more for the dollar, I will make these purchases in Delhi and Jammu. Simply send the check and specify how you want the money to be spent. If you can also send a card or letter of encouragement (and even a photo of yourself) along with the check, I can give them the card or letter (and photo) along with your gift.  If you cannot think of anything specific to donate, then please help pay for the general costs of the Retreat.  Please send your checks, cards, letters, photos etc to: Dhiraj Bakaya 42 Meadow Court Sinking Spring, PA 19608  Checks should be made payable to KOA (Kashmiri Overseas Association). You can add "Jammu Retreat" in the memo. Please get them to me by Thursday July 15.  Please note if you are writing to the children, they are fluent in Hindi, are generally also proficient in Kashmiri, and have a very limited understanding of English. So if you are going to write in English please keep it simple, though I am sure their teachers will translate for them. What is more important than for them to understand all the words is to have something in their hands which shows you care.  If you have any more questions on this please let me know. My email address is dhirajbakaya@yahoo.com.  To ensure we do not overdo some gifts, I will endeavor to post updates on here on how much has been raised thus far and what the money is to be used for.  Thanks everyone!   Dhiraj

						   Namaskar All,  I have set up this blog to provide you all an update on the planning of the Retreat in Jammu from July 24-26.  What is the retreat?  It is going to be held at Gandhi Memorial College on the outskirts of Jammu City from Saturday July 24 through Monday July 26.  We are expecting about 80 kids from the Muthi, Mishriwalla and Nagrota Kashmiri Pandit refugee camps on each day. The likely age group shall be ages 12 and above.  The goal of this event is to provide an educational, fun-filled and inspirational experience to the underprivileged KP refugee camp children of the Jammu region. We shall attempt to bring the world to them, and share with them a glimpse of the worlds of music, art, culture, history and to discuss with them their futures, to motivate them and ultimately to help provide them opportunities.  The days will be filled by partaking in various activities, from sports and games, to discussions and guest speakers, to demonstrations and learning. We want to inspire and educate the children. We will provide advice and show them their part in the future of the Kashmiri Pandit community. We will also take tours of Jammu sights, such as Ragunath Mandir, Bahu Fort, etc We will also try and watch a Bollywood film at a cinema hall!  Following the program, we will have a better idea of what the children need in the future - by the way of books to improve their school library, perhaps computers and software, clothes, etc  They are currently receiving education in schools, as well as basic health care and their parents receive a small monthly allowance from the Government. What this program wants to do instead is to energise their spirits and show them that the worldwide KP community supports them.  Please check back here over the coming days and weeks to see how all is progressing!  Thanks,   Dhiraj

						   The Retreat went amazingly well. Everything fell into place and the dream became a beautiful reality.  I shall write more soon on how things went...but for now here is a release by the KOA:  KOA Organizes Retreat For Children at Jammu  By Vivek Raina, India Liaison  The Kashmiri Overseas Association recently organized a three-day retreat for children from various refugee camps located at Muthi, Mishriwalla and Nagrota, Jammu. This initiative by US based Kashmiri Pandit Youth Group led by Dhiraj Bakaya was aimed at children aged 12 to 17 year olds. The funds for the event were raised from donations at the recently concluded KOA National Camp in USA. This event also received all possible support and encouragement from Jammu based Kashmiri Pandit organizations and other personalities.  The retreat, held from the 24th to the 26th of July, was organized at Gandhi Memorial College, located on the outskirts of Jammu City. A total of 175 children along with their teachers attended the event.  The primary idea behind the program was to energize and enthuse children from the various migrant camps and express solidarity with them. By providing an educational, fun-filled and inspirational experience to these children, an attempt was made to introduce them to the world of music, art, culture, and history. The primary idea behind this retreat for children from camps was to provide an educational and inspirational platform where they could uninhibitedly discuss various career options and learn about various opportunities. The participants were served with meals on all three days.  The thoughtfully planned itinerary included talks by eminent speakers, sports and games, and cultural shows. The renowned music composer Sh. Krishan Langoo and the acclaimed artist Sh. Gokul Dembi conducted orientation courses in the field of Music and Art, respectively. The Retreat also saw the children being taken on an enjoyable outing, which included a trip to the famous Bahu Temple, followed by rides in the nearby amusement park and a visit to a local cinema to watch the latest Bollywood flick "Lakshya"! The spontaneous display of talent by the children, in the form of songs, skits and dramas, captured by Doordarshan Jammu, left everyone enthralled!  Dhiraj Bakaya of Pennsylvania, currently on a personal trip to India, supervised the implementation of this retreat for children. Nihar Ganju of Florida and Priya Sultan of New Jersy, who are currently in Jammu, helped Dhiraj. Dhiraj also visited all camps in order to meet different children and brethren living in camps. In his address to children, Dhiraj promised the continuation of such events by KOA in the future and pledged its support to the development of micro projects for children from camps in such a way that their latent potential is productively tapped for their personal enhancement and the betterment of the community and the nation.  The prominent personalities from the Kashmiri Pandit community who participated in the event include Sh. A. K. Diwani, Ms Kailash Mehra, Sh. Moti Kaul, Dr. O. P. Razdan, Dr. K.L.Choudhary, Dr. Agnishekhar, Sh. Sapru (Principal Gandhi College), Sh. Kulbushan Kachroo, Sh. M.K. Bhat (President, Lalleshwari Centre), and Principals of various Schools. Ms Dulari Kaul, Principal, Vishwa Bharati School, was the key speaker on the concluding day.  Mr. Vivek Raina, KOAâ€™s liaison person in Jammu who was ably assisted by Mr Kuldeep Kaw, made local arrangements. Travel arrangements were made by Vishnu Bharati School Jammu, the hall and other facilities were provided free of cost by Gandhi College through its board Hindu Education Society.

						   Thanks SO MUCH to all of you for your support of this initiative. Many of you have also volunteered your time when you visit Jammu in the coming months and even next year. I will do my best to set up some long term program to continue helping the children in our own small way.  I have had many people volunteer their time to attend the retreat and speak to and spend time with the children. Thanks to my fellow US-based youth Nihar Ganju (FL) and Priya Sultan (NJ) who will be in Jammu at the same time and will help coordinate this event. Thanks also to the many Jammu-based volunteers such as Kailash Mehra Sadhu and Krishen Langoo who will lead the children in singing. We are also finalizing a distinguished list of speakers to speak on various topics.  As for messages of support, I had four poster size cardboards full of messages of support written by some attendees of the July 4 KOA National Camp. I am going to have these framed and they will be hung on the walls of either their school or community hall.  And as for donations, we have raised over $750 thus far, which has been very encouraging. I will be making the necessary purchases once I get to India.    Please do get checks and letters to me soon if you too wish to contribute.
