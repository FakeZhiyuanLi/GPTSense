      So today was one for the record books I think.  I have, as some of you know, had quite a few random adventures of the years and today’s ranks pretty high.  It was scary on a number of instances, was almost completely legal, and only involved one near death experience.  However, it was the group I was with that made the occasion as memorable as it turned out to be.  Still, even the HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY edited version I told me mother merited the comment, “you should write a book with all the stuff that happens to you”.  BTW…if any of you ever tell my mother or brother or father the real version (what is posted here) I will kill you.  No joke, if and’s or but’s.  So keep it shut.    	Here’s what happened.  It started off as a pretty conventional day.  I woke up around 9am because of the barking dog.  Then I sort of lazed around half cleaning and half asleep until around 12:00pm when Mark called.  He said he was going to have a barbecue sort of like the one I had a few days back.  Swimming, food, games and overall fun with a few people.  First we went to Foothill to mooch money of Mark’s mother, and once that was done we headed over to Safeway to get the food and drinks.  Afterwards, we picked up Rodrigo and headed back to Mark’s.  We played some games and got in the pool when Nikhil arrived around 2:30 maybe 3:00’ish.  Then we ate and swam some more.  After a while around 5:30’ish we headed over to blockbuster to rent SC 2 for the x-box which is what Mark has.  Unfortunately they didn’t have it, so we went to Rod’s house to figure out what else to do.  We took my van.  We were playing a bit of guilty gear X or something when Schwingle called.  He was finally free to do something, so we all piled into my car and headed over there.  We picked him up and then we headed back to Mark’s house to drop off Nikhil because he needed to go home.  Then we headed over to Heather Farms to see the new rock wall they installed.  We climbed it a bit and just sorta randomly played around on the rest of the child’s equipment just for monkies sake.  They have this funky thing that simulates sliding along a rope.  We did that, then took turns pushing and accelerating each other so hard that when he hit the edge our hands would lose their grip and we would go flying off and hit the ground.  That was fun.  Then I tried it backwards a few times, felt as though I was going to die, and stopped.  Now once again we were strapped for ideas on what to do.  So, at this point I had called my mom and told her I was going to spend the night at Mark’s house so that I could stay out late and do crazy stuff in my van.  Heh, that turned out to be interesting.      	Schwingle wanted to go offroading in Martinez in my van.  I felt this wouldn’t be a very good idea, so I decided against it.  Instead we went drifting around Walnut Blvd. again, and this time in the van.  There is this one part where the road is inclined right to left.  I decided to take the van up and do a hard accelerating turn out of it.  That was fun, as was drifting a little and mostly hard turning/backend whipping around Walnut and it’s side streets.  Norlym ln, yup, great place.  Anyways, so then we decided to head toward Rod’s house in general and ended up going up Northgate Road.  We went…and went…and went.  We got past the ticket booth for Mt. Diablo because it was closed and went into this one 25mph turn around 50 and nearly died.  There was an oncoming car that we ‘almost’ hit, because it was a blind curve.  I figured there was like a 50/50 chance that there would be a car on the other side.  Luckily it was a bit high up the inclined blind curve, so we missed and I was able to correct alright.  Then I did some more crazy driving and decided to pull a fairly hard u-turn using the dirt shoulder.  Big mistake.  No we didn’t go tumbling off Mt. Diablo, like you are probably hoping.  I did however, hear a loud BANG and then Badum, badum, badum badum.  So I pulled off on the side and upon inspection found I had a flat front left side tire.  No big deal, lets pull out the spare, pop it on and be on our way in 15 minutes easy.  Well, my spare tire I believe had a puncture, but more importantly was missing it’s valve core.  That is the little thing inside the small round tube sticking out of the tire that if you press lets air out of the tire.  Well, without it at all, the tire can’t hold air period.  Now the shit has hit the fan.  However, we decided, fuck it, lets put on the spare anyways and get as far as we can out of Mt. Diablo park.   	 	Now, you see my master plan at this moment was to somehow make it down to Rod’s house so I could say that while going up Diablo Shadows the original tire got cut by a piece of glass.  I then changed it out with the spare, and then came back home.  Well, that plan got crapped because the spare was dead.  So a slight modification, then we put on the spare and limped back home because the spare was bad.  Brilliant I thought.  Way to lie, I am an asshole.  But oh well, better a live asshole then a dead one.    	So we put on the spare and went limping on my dead and flat spare tire/rims down Northgate Road.  Now Schwingle had predicted about a quarter mile until I was scraping metal.  I figured around a full mile because the tires have metal threads, so the rims would have some protection.  We both had auto freshman year, so switching the tire and doing all this shit wasn’t a hard thing.  Although I will admit that Schwingle did most of the work.  I tried to keep a steady 5 – 8 mph pace.  The failing light was a little alarming, but also added a bit of excitement to the whole thing.  So limping we went screaming and yelling at the van to live, having an oddly good time singing songs about ‘staying alive’, saving Maz’s ass, etc.  Anyways, that tire is godlike.  Some how, some way, it managed to limp for nearly 3 maybe 4 miles to Diablo Shadows where Rod made a moving car jump out onto the street cause we weren’t fucking stopping at this point.  Stop signs, bah.  I never liked them much anyways.  So Rod went home and Schwingle and Mark and I actually managed to gimp our way to the Valero station at Encina and parked.  There, the tire was completely shredded.  Destroyed.  Complete Fatality.  It was very cool.    	I finally called home and told my mother that we had been at Rod’s house, then went to pick up Schwingle.  We were coming back to drop off Rodrigo and I hit glass and cut the original tire a little going up Diablo Shadows.  Then we got to the top, and replaced it with the spare tire and were coming down Diablo Shadows when the nearly 7 year old replacement tire blew up on us (I had to explain the utter fuck-ed-ness of the spare tire somehow).  Then we freaked out and limped to the Valero and called her.  Bwahahaha, a brilliant bitchy ass thing to do.  Whatever, stayin’ alive.  	So my brother came to Valero and we got super glue and bubble gum and made a b/s temp. patch to the original tire, filled it, and finally came back home around 10:30pm.   Naturally the patch didn’t work to great, but the ride home was almost seamless.  Felt as if the tire barely had a hole.  Still, the gum was all over the street.  Obviously I didn’t spend the night at Mark’s house, but oh well.  Still alive, and proud of it.   	Now I probably forgot some small details or maybe a very large one, but so it goes when you tell long story like this.  I should also talk about Tuesday, and how Anton, Jeff, Nikhil, and Mark came over, and by the end of the day we ended up at Arbolado just chilling on top of the jungle gym.  That was fun too but it wasn’t an adventure.  There is something special about four guys limping down the road at 5 miles an hour in a beat up old mini-van with 3 good tires and one shredded tire singing and yelling and having an absolutely great time.  There is something there that makes getting a new tire perfectly alright.  That and Rod's one-hundered percent random as heck comments.  Rod: "I told you guys this wasn't a good idea...if that tire was bigger i could have gotten in it and then rolled down"  LOL.  On the bright side, the van did need a new spare tire, so it isn’t all that bad.  I gotta say, I love that van.  Heh, I should pick up Gira and a few other girls in it.  Then it really would be a pimpin’ Van.    Brother: “What possessed you to take your van instead of Mark’s car?” Mark: “Because it’s Pimp!”  Roflmao.   Oh yeah, and at the barbecue we invented a new word.  Papo!  supposed to be papdr, but Rod pronounced it bad, so Papo!.  Also, for any girls reading this, ur all bangtails!  bwahahahahaha.  J/K J/K J/K...Don't hurt me.

           So yesterday, i woke up and went to counseling 105 with the starter kit that i borrowed from Anton because the DVC bookstore was closed.  The counseling session was fairly interesting and i found out some useful things about concurrent enrollment at DVC and Berkeley, and also about the transfering process in general.  On a more interesting note, i met Gira Addly, a very pretty girl who i drove home after the session.      The story goes like this:  She forgot to bring a pen/pencil so she asked to borrow one of mine.  Then she also forgot to bring a starter kit (like 90% of the class) so we decided to sit next to each other and share.  We talked and got along pretty well throughout the session, and i was going to have lunch with her, but she dissappeared.  So i ate with Chris instead.  After lunch we were deciding our courses and she lined up her day so we would have 2 maybe 3 classes together.  Afterwards, she was leaving and i figured she didn't have a ride, so i asked if she would let me drive her home.  So i did.        Now the point of this story is that i am an idiot.  Throughout this whole thing...i never asked for her number.  I completeley forgot to ask for her number.  I was kinda happy about driving some very pretty girl back to her house who i had met that morning, and so i forgot to ask for her number.  How fucking dumb do you get?  I nearly kicked my own ass when i realized that on Sunday.  ARRGGGHHHH.  I suppose i will see her again in the fall, unless she is at home thinking, "haha, i made some dumb shmuck sign up for a bunch of classes at random times in the day and now i am gonna pick other classes and laugh at him".  Well, to say the least, that would suck.  But oh well, what the hell.      So anyways, after counseling and driving Gira home, i went to Ace's house because he got his eagle scout status that day in the morning.  That reception was fun, and i mostly chatted with friends who i don't very often because they are off at college.  I caught up with Nile and his life at Reed, where he took Modern Christianity with Gishe's daughter.  Kashy seemed a little bored with UC Santa Cruz, but she looked great and was fun as ever.  They all wanted my stories, and stories about graduation and senior year.  They found Ashland particulary interesting.  I also talked a lot with Andre, who has switched from Comp. Sci. at Berkeley to Cognitive Sciene, and is liking that.  He is also on the Rowing team, and they took first in Nationals.  W00T, go Berkeley.       We talked and ate at Ace's for a while, and then went down to Walnut Acres where we played football for a while, and i cut up my shin pretty good.  But that's OK cause i made the interception.  We quit playing football though, because they girls weren't playing, so we switched to ultimate frisbee where it seemed Jenna was perpetually open.  My team rocked at ultimate frisbee because our strategy was grab it and throw it to Jenna who is standing quietly in the end zone.  That was fun.      Sunday (which was about an hour ago) was a fun day too.  I had a barbecue and had Jeff and Mark over, along with Devin, my brother's good friend.  We swam in my pool, relaxed, and ate my brother's fantastic barbecued chicken.        The pool was fun, we had fights with those funky noodle things.  I am quite sure i beat Jeff, and i am not sure whether Mark beat me.  I do know however, that my brother owned all.  Those darn fencing skills seemed to help.  "WHAP" to the face, follwed by another and another.  You're sitting swearing you blocked those shots, but then again the left side of your face is burning like a bitch.  It was a lot of fun.      After we ate and swam, we played a little SC 2 and then we watched the Godfather since neither Jeff nor Devin had seen it.  That was of course good.  Then Mark left, and Jeff and i played a little more SC 2.  He left around 7 and i relaxed until around 8 when Mark called.  We decided to go out and get coffee around 8:30, and he drove this time.  We called Rod again, but he was busy.  So we went to whole foods and got a little coffee and wasted time until Rod was free.  Then we went drifting around the Arbalado, Rancho Priso areas, and then upped and left for Walnut Blvd.  That road, for those who have never been, is a great drive.  Curves, hard curves, low traffic, dim lights, creepy area.  The perfect makings for a late night drifting session.  Course, we went around one curve at 45 instead of the recommended 25 and 'nearly' hit an oncoming car.  Mark made a great dodge then correction to get us out alright.  We then drove the hell away, and parked and waited for a while.  Pretty soon, i am quite positive the same car came back so we ducked and waited for it to pass, and then drove off in the opposite direction.  Finally, we went to Albertson's cause we were kinda hungry.  We ended up buying ice cream because it was on sale, and then went to Rod's house and ate it.  I got back around 11:00pm 'ish, perfectly in one piece.  Just barely though.  But oh well, that was fun.  Heh, at one point there is this church we found and were bored.  So we went and drifted in and out of the parking lot in Mark's Taurus and then just sorta easily drove away.  That was fun.        So the first weekend out of Northgate turned out to be really fricking cool, and a whole lot of fun.  If this pace keeps up for the rest of summer i might really collapse.  I am bloody tired and my leg feels like it is on fire.  But that is all ok, because to get in that shape i had a heck of a lot of fun.  heh, can't wait for summer DVC to start.  I am sure that will make my days even more fun.  Oh well, what the hell.    Monkies are cool.

           Well, following the recommendation of our favorite pokemon, Mattoy, i decided to move my brandnew Xanga journal thing over to blogger.com.  I am not sure why, but Matt tells me that this way anyone can post anything on blog (i hate that term), unlike Xanga where only members could post, and they had to login in to do so.  Also, i had personally experienced problems with Xanga becuase there system had the annoying tendancy to tell me i didn't have a Xanga.  Odd.       For those reasons i switched over to blogger, where i at least don't have the same problems i did with Xanga.  However, i still find myself strapped for time, so i am using one of blogger's supplied templates.  I know, it is pathetic, but i don't really feel like wasting time making a coolio aesthetically pleasing design.  I just plan to use this thing to vent a bit.       So yesterday was fun.  About 10 guys showed up at Arbolado and we had a fun soccer game.  We one 8-7 and it was a close game.  Then we went to Jacob's house and watched Rocky for some reason, and that was neat too.  Unfortunately we were bums, since we ate his food, watched his movie and then left.  But oh well.         I am not really going in chronological order here, but who cares.  Day before yesterday (Wednesday) was good fun.  I woke up around 1:00, and headed over to the English Honors barbecue at Jenna's house around 3:00.  Had a veggie burger, signed yearbooks, talked with some people for what may have been the last time.  I found out Jacob is about the only person i know who has heard of, and actually likes Jackson Brown.  He is going to Brown's concert in Clearlake in July.  That should be fun for him.  I once went to a Jackson Brown concert, and although my brother and i were about the only people under 40 there, it was still great fun.         Grad. Night was awesome.  I gambled, sumo-wrestled, raced in the obstacle course, and most of all bowled.  Dang, I believe Chris and i were the longest bowlers.  We each racked up about 3 hours of bowling, and we were on 3 to 4 lanes simultaneously.  That was great fun.  Later on Peter won a PS2 from the raffles.  It is always nice when someone you know wins something.          Today i went to school to talk to Riley about my van and the vandalism, and also to get the registrar to mail my transcript to DVC.  Lastly i wanted to get a few teachers to sign my yearbook, and then aftwerwards me, Anton, Matt, Asmita, Felicia, Kevin and Ian went to lunch at the Spring Garden.  That was nice, though the food was rather...bad.  But oh well.          Tommorrow is good old counseling 105 at DVC from 9:00am to 3:50pm.  Indeed that is going to suck big brass ones.  But oh well, whatever.  Nothing can be done about it.         While i was at school, i was getting Mrs. Bandrowski to sign my yearbook.  Mr. Tillian, was also close by.  He asked me where i was going to school next fall, so i told him.  He asked me why i was going there, and where i had applied to.  So i told him where i applied, where i got in, and then why i was going to DVC.  For some reason, he seemed to get offended by the fact that i chose to go to DVC over UCLA, because his daughter goes there.  He simply didn't believe and refused to acknowledge the fact that i got into UCLA.  That was odd.  Then the registrar gives me her brother's email address because he has a Doctorate in bio-physics.  That is what i want to do as well.  The registrar's brother's had gone to DAVIS, which is why she was telling me all of her life story.  Funky Monkey Stylin'.       I realized the other day, that i would simply never, ever, be getting up at 6:00Am to get to Aperiod by 7:00AM.  I would almost never drive down oak grove on that side during that timeframe again.  This made me kinda sad.  Everyday, i would leave home around 7:55.  The hill in front of my house is gorgeous at this time of the year and at that time of day.  Then the sprinklers turn on right around the diablo shawdows area.  The sun always shined through the rays of water and seemed to illuminate ever thing around it.  Mt. Diablo is especially pretty at that time.  in the Windter it is all white.  In the spring, green.  In the fall, light brown.  I am going to miss that, and many other things about Northgate.  As much of a prison it was, and as bad as the Adminstration was, i still had fun at Northgate...sometimes.

      Tuesday, June 08, 2004        Well, i finally decided to make one of these funny online bitch session things.  I figured it would be funny to make one on the last day of highschool.  If not funny, just ironic at least, since they are primarily use by students to talk about highschool issues.  I am not sure for what purpose this thing will be used, but it is late at night and i wanted to make it for monkies sake.         Obviously this design (if you want to call it that) is just a temp until the thing quits telling me i am non-existant half the time.  Xanga, i have found already, has some datastructuring problems.  Oh well though, it still seems to be popular enough that no one cares.         Now one thing i have noticed, and that i have also be warned of by other...xanga'ers, is that writing one of these journals causes a person to write much more then is neccessary, and can be very destructive to a group of friends.  So for now i will limit my rantings, and carefully decide the topics so as to spare the oversensitive feelings of certain people.         So tommorrow i graduate.  Today was the last day of school, and it was pretty fun.  Played some PS-2, damn that Jeff is too good with Raphael.  I only beat him twice.  Besides that, i got some of my teachers to sign my yearbook, though i am going to need to come back on Wednesday to complete the yearbook signing crusade.  I think i got most everyone's signatures that i wanted from the student body, so at least that is done.  One thing though, that really bugs me.  Almost all of my friends are going to some big four-year college somewhere.  A lot of people are going to Berkeley too.  That is a good school, i wish i had gotten in there.  I only got into UCLA, Davis and Cal Poly.  Berkeley i guess was just a tiny notch too high for me.  So i basically wasted four years of working to go to DVC, or Diablo Vacation Center as they so playfully call it, and work my ass off again so i can transfer to Berkeley.         This feels like utter shit.  The worst i think, is when people are signing my yearbook and they forget where i am going next fall.  So they ask, and i have to answer, "oh, i am going to DVC".  Everybody feels proud of graduating and going whereever they are, but i can't.  I am finding it really hard to be very happy about this.  Oh well, fuuccckk iittt.  That's my motto.       I did, however, get advice from the most unimaginable person.  Now, a lot of my friends come to me with their problems and i end up giving them advice on what to do, or what to think.  The problem i deal with the most is depression.  Everyone is always fucking depressed, so i try and make them feel better.  Often times, the situation is actually very simple and they have made it contrived in their own mind, or the situation is only depressing from a certain angle.  Anyways, when i was feeling depressed over this, my friend (one who i have counseled for four years) says to me, "Consider it a challenge.  There are milestones and stepping stones in life.  Which do you think this is?"         Smart guy, he is.  He tries to hide it by be dumb and getting drunk, but he is pretty smart.  Oh well, it is late.  I best go so i have some energy for grad. night tommorrow.    PAAARRRTTYYYY!!!! WOOOOOOT!

      So today sure was a fun day.  Not exactly text-book, but then again none of my days seem to be so.  First we started off planning to go the Water World in the morning.  We were all going to meet at Anton’s house (Me, Anton, Jeff and Nikhil), and go to the park around 11 am.  Well, when I woke up this morning I saw rain clouds.  I turned on the news and they started right off with, “Today is predicted to be the coldest day of summer thus far….”  Well, Water World suddenly didn’t seem like a great idea.  When we got to Anton’s house, we played Auto Modelista, a VERY fun and cool racing game that I would recommend to anyone with a PS-2, for about an hour.  Then we drove over to Water World, decided we were hungry, and went to The Mediterranean to eat lunch.  Yes, that is the name of the restaurant, The Mediterranean.  After lunch, we decided to go see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle since we were close by to Brendan and the day was rather cold for Water World.  The movie is HILARIOUS.  Absolutely absurd and idiotic, but off-your-ass funny.  It was especially funny because I am Indian, Nikhil is Indian, and Jeff is Korean; we got all the racial jokes.  Anton, though, also thought it was an awesome movie.  Afterwards, we went back to Anton’s house and played that game for another long while before Nikhil had to leave.  So we all piled into Antonio’s Acura again and went to drop off Nikhil.  Afterwards Jeff, Anton, and I went out for pizza at New York Pizza, where some punk partially unscrewed the damned chili cap so that when I turned it over, all the chili fell onto my pizza.  I hate about ¾ of the first slice, but the massive amount was even too much for me to handle with one cup of rootbeer.  About half way through the second slice, though, I had had it.  I asked the guy at the counter for a refill and told him what happened, and he gave it to me for free.  That was cool.  Following dinner we played a game of cutthroat without revival at the table they had there because once a ball went into the pocket, you couldn’t take it back out.  I schooled Jeff and Anton, but it was unfair because I have a pool table and they don’t.  I get to play pretty often.  However, it was funny watching them suck.  Boy that sounds fucked up.  Whatever.  Finally I went home and that about sums up the day.  Tomorrow I will probably go to S.F. with Rod, Annie, Morgan and a few other people to watch some new samurai movie or something.  Who knows? That is the way I am operating right now.  Whatever, whenever, just going with the flow.  DVC is going pretty well.  I have a high A in Calc. and a high A in English, so that is good.  I have been kind of confused recently about DVC because there is a girl in my English class who I, at first, didn’t like very much.  However over the past five weeks she has really loosened up around me and now I find that I look forward to going to English so that I can see her.  I am reasonably sure that she at least sort of likes me too.  She comes into class now and sits next to me.  We talk a lot the whole way through class, and stuff.  I almost asked her to come get a cup of coffee with me at the end of class Thursday, but her friend whisked her off almost immediately after class for something.  That was too bad.  The semester ends next week, so I will have to make a move soon if I want to.  The problem is she is still just now a senior at College Park.  But maybe that is o.k.  We’ll see.  Oh yeah, and she is also Asian, short, not too bright, but very cute and likable.  Whatever.  These sort of things confuse me; you can’t apply logical reasoning to crap like this.  At least I can’t.  Oh well, what the hell. There was some other stuff I wanted to write that I have been meaning to for the last few posts.  Unfortunately, again, I feel tired.  It is midnight, and talking about what I mean to will take sometime and concentration.  Oh well, until next time then  Schwermas rock.  Drifting rules.  School is boring.  Monkies are cool.

       Haven't updated for a while, so here is a sort of summary of recent events.     &nbsp;   The other week Gabe came over, and that was fun.&nbsp; He is a neat guy, though he is awfully perverted beyond all hope of normalcy.&nbsp; Still, having not seen him in four years resulted in lots of late nights around town, which was fun.&nbsp; One of the last nights Gabe was here, last friday, we, that is to say jeff, mark, gabe, and I, went to see I-Robot at the Pleasant Hill Century.&nbsp; The movie was good, and afterwards we went to the nearby chipotle to have dinner.&nbsp; From there to home, a series of funny and fun events happened.&nbsp; First - Jeff's ninja skill lapse (and thats not all that lapsed).&nbsp; We were waiting to cross the interestection to go back to the car, and jeff wanted to J-walk the way we had earlier to get to chipotle.&nbsp; Well, this time there was a cop standing and giving a ticket to a man about 20 feet away on the other side of the street, so j-walking wasn't a great idea.&nbsp; Jeff however, didn't notice so he walks out into the middle of the intersection and turns to look what I am doing.&nbsp; Now i am yelling at Jeff to come back, he is standing there, and the cop is simply watching with interest.&nbsp; Finally i tried to tell Jeff that there was a policeman behind him, and i ended up actually pointing at the guy.&nbsp; Jeff finally turned and saw the police officer, but not before the officer yelled "What the hell are you doing?!" at jeff.&nbsp; Jeff then ran his ass out of the interesection.&nbsp; It was quite hilarious.&nbsp;     The next very odd event came from Mark.&nbsp; He really had to take a leak, and couldn't hold it.&nbsp; So in the parking garage, we had parked on the lowest level, he went to the corner to relieve himself.&nbsp; This was odd enough.&nbsp; Then a car happened to come by and turn to park on the same level we were on, so we yelled at Mark to cut it short and move, which he did while cursing harshly.&nbsp;     On our way home i was in the back seat with Gabe, and jeff was in front next to mark.&nbsp; In the car next to us at one stop light Gabe said he saw a couple of chicks, so he yelled a line and gestured to them.&nbsp; The problem was the car he was looking at was on my side, so Gabe was yelling over me.&nbsp; We decided to switch seats in the car, so Gabe could yell at the girls easier.&nbsp; The problem for this was that in the front, driving the car Gabe was yelling at, the father of the girls was driving.&nbsp; While nothing actually came out of this, it did scare Gabe enough that he passed up hitting on the girls at the next light and sank down into his chair.&nbsp; That is quite a feat for Gabe, and it was hilarious for the rest of us.&nbsp;     After Jeff was dropped off, Mark, Gabe, and I decided to go  screaching and a little sliding around the parking lot of Arbolado Park.&nbsp; Not the bottom one mind you, but the top one near the soccer field and the tennis courts.&nbsp; THAT was cool.&nbsp; Mark showed some skill going roundy-roundy really fast in his Taurus.&nbsp; We had a little smoke coming too.&nbsp; Afterwards, i was dropped off home, and that did it for that day.&nbsp;   I was going to write about some other stuff, but it's 1:00am and i am tired.&nbsp; Besides i have yardwork to do tommorrow: 200sq feet of sawd await.&nbsp; The dog needs his grass patch.&nbsp; Fun Fun...

           You know, i get bloody well confused sometimes.  I really begin to wonder why everyone always seems so fricking depressed all the time.  The tiniest damned thing happens, and my friends all seem to blow it way out of depression in their heads.  They all end up depressed as hell over something that can either be logically solved or at least rationalized very easily.        The other wierd thing is that people seem to get depressed for absolutley no fucking reason at all.  Life is great and kicking, but they are all down and out for no logical reason whatsoever.  I swear it is the doing of blogs and xangas.  They all seem to boil down into bitchfests like this one, except the poster is usually much depressed instead of angry.  Some of my friends might read this message and you know who you are.  So quit being so god damned sentimental and positively whimpy about life.  I have already told you this before, and you seemed to understand for a while.  But lo and behold, here we go again with the whole "i am depressed because the world sucks for me" bit.  I tell you, there are a lot of people who would kill to have a great house in a nice area and admission to a great college with the ability to actually fucking pay for it.  Keep that in mind the next time you feel like going and whining about insignificant wrongs that might happen to you.        Well, i feel better.  Back to my essay.

           So Friday Anton, Jeff, and Nikhil came over.  We sort of putzed around all day and played some video games until dinnertime, when my mom made spaghetti and garlic bread.  Then we headed to Anton's house for some poker and later on the Stargate SG-1 premier from 11:00 to 1:00.  That was a fun filled day, and i won-out in the poker game after having nearly gone bankrupt at one point.  I will admit though, i sort of cheated.  I started telling the group some of my stories and they got distracted, so i was able to kind of hustle them.  WOOT! My greatest weapon: my story telling.         Anyways, Gabe finally arrived on Saturday around 2:45pm from Silverdale Washington.  Almost right away we whisked him off to the bowling alley with us for Chris's graduation party.  The bowling was fun, and afterwards we all went to the Spring Garden chinese restaurant to have dinner.  Afterwards...actually i am having kind of a hard time remembering....  I got it.  We went back to my house and mark came over.  After a little while Jeff, Gabe, Mark and I all headed over to Mark's house, but unfortunately Jeff had to go home pretty quick.  So Mark and Gabe and I went out driving around and eventually ended up at Valle Verde around midnight where we just chilled on the jungle gym for a while.  Some other things happened getting to Valle Verde, but it isn't important i think.  Then we went back to Mark's house where we crashed until 10:00am Sunday.  Then we ate and went around again.  First we went to Fry's, then to the Mall, and finally to Barne's and Noble.  That spent just about the entire day.  We were waiting for Jeff to get off work, but unfortunately, "Something came up" so he couldn't come see Anchorman with us at 7:20.  By the way, that movie is bloody well hilarious.  I think dodgeball was better because it was more of a movie.  Anchorman was basically one long SNL skit.              So today i had class again, and i am happy to say that i have A's in both Math and English at the moment, and i expect it to stay that way.  However, i basically slept through English today because i was frickin' tired from the past couple of nights.  When i got back i wrote a quick essay and then went out with Ace, Paul, Kyle, Morgan and Draven to blow up some bottles around 8:30.  You see, if you take a waterbottle, let out some water, stuff in some dry ice, and then throw them high up, when they hit the ground they will explode.  The sound is easily that of an M80, and it is completely legal and safe.  Only problem is, the loudness.  That is why we went out onto Franklin Canyon Road (for those of you who don't know, it is a very loneley and mostly deserted road with a gravel right side...lotsa fun).  On the way there and back, Morgan and Draven decided to flash which was neat.  Poor Ace never paid attention.  Anyways, so i got back around 11:00pm and ate dinner.  Finally, here i am at 1:00am Tuesday morning.  Well, that's another weekend wrapped up for you, and it was pretty good fun i must say.  Maybe i will post some Padillonics later on, because they do sound kinda funny.  Anyways, Monkies Rock.

      Well, I haven’t updated in a while.  I guess I have been busy with school and Tahoe and misc. stuff.  So basic updates: Peter has been trying to organize a sort of weekly soccer game, and I have been trying to help.  So far they have all been really fun with football and then some general hanging out at someone’s house or Arbolado.  That is always fun, and I do rather look forward to it once a week.    So DVC summer school started last Monday, and I must say it sucks ass.  The math class is just calculus, so that is fine.  I sit there doing the homework and am quite alright.  It is the English class that serves to make me want to kill myself.  The class is only two hours long, but is SO AWFULLY BORING it isn’t even funny.  The teacher talks about proper citation and plagiarism for this allotted time, and then assigns us homework.  So far, I have had an essay-a-day going following the first day of instruction.  This also sucks.  I like writing, but not that much.  Oh well, what the hell.  I screwed up enough to be going to DVC in the first place so I guess some sort of penance is understandable.    I have worked out my schedule for the next two years.  I know what classes and how many I am going to take to transfer to Berkeley as either an MCB or Physics major.  It is kinda lucky, that to keep my options open like that only costs me 3 extra classes over just doing Physics.  I figure, why not do it?  Although I will be taking around 18 – 20 units a semester, it’s alright cause a lot of the classes are review because of Physio and Chem and Physics, Biotech, etc.  So Happy Belated 4th of July everybody!  Hope you all had a rocking time, cause I sure did.  I went to Tahoe to help out with the motel again, but ended up going jet skiing, eating lunch at a Mongolian Barbecue type of place, talking and half-partying with the college kids staying at our motel, and getting the Tahoe phone # of a flat out BEAUTIFUL waitress at “Fire + Ice” the restaurant I was talking about.  Man, that girl was GORGEOUS.  My brother didn’t really like her very much, but I sure did, and she liked me enough to give me her #.  Hehehe, I remembered this time.  Made damn sure of it.  Anyways, she is 18 and works up there during the summer.  Originally she is from North Dakota, where she lives with her parents and goes to community college up there.  She’s got two younger brothers and a dog back there.  She was about an inch shorter then me, with sort of oval eyes and dark hair.  Everything else about her was fine too.  I was loving every bite of that meal.  And for those of you saying that she just did it for the tip, your wrong cause I called her while I was up there just to make sure, and it rang her cell phone.  So the number was real.  I might be going back to Tahoe more often.  It sure is a friendly place. :)  Jetskiing was fun, and I threw my brother off the back end of ours when I took a turn really hard.  He literally went flying off and into the water.  It looked awesome.  Also, I got up to about 60 miles an hour on the jet ski and I got to say, it feels like your flying.  That is…until you hit the chop again.  You HAVE to sort of stand like a baseball catcher while driving or else you will have melon sized swollen ones by the time your done.  I wonder if horseback riding is similar?  There were a bunch of college kids who stayed in our motel, and apparently stay there every year during July fourth.  They were all highschool buddies, and now drive up from their miscellaneous colleges.  One guy was from UCLA, Jeff’s school next year.  We had a funny exchange.  At one point he came asking for bandaids because he hurt himself while on the beach.  While my mom was inside looking for them, me and my brother and then my mom once she got back chatted with him for a while.  Eventually he says, “You know, you guys are nice.  Thanks for being so hospitable and all, it is really nice of you.  I am from L.A., I am not used to that.”  So that’s what good old Jeff has to look forward to.  Oh well, can’t be too bad.    I said “half-partyed” earlier because my parents were there, and there was a lot of alcohol of course being passed around that I had no part of.  Not to say that I would have had any if my parents weren’t there.  Though I might have.  We had 8 just graduated from H/S and freshman in college girls in room 16, and 5 girls in room 20.  Room 10 had those college buds I mentioned earlier, about 5 of them.  Room 21 also had about 4 guys.  The rest of the motel was sold out with average families or regulars.  The “kids” were partying until nearly 3:30 this morning.  It was kinda hard to sleep, but it was ok.  Once a year is definitely alright.  Besides, they were paying the $100 a room rate, so they can do what they want.    This Friday I went with Nikhil, Jeff, Anton Roger and Bob to see Spidey 2.  The movie was good, albeit cheesy at parts.  The fights were bloody awesome though.  Afterwards, Nikhil, Jeff Anton and I wandered throughout Barnes and Noble for a while, ate some Chipotle and then went to Nikhil’s house and played carams for a while.  That was good fun.  We also had a breaking/broken cars discussion and I realized that only Jeff’s car is still in good condition.  BTW, this came about because Anton’s key mechanism came out of his mom’s BMW when he withdrew the key.  I was nearly on the ground laughing.  The whole bloody lock came out, it was unbelievable.  Anyways, so this weekend was superb, and I cleaned my desk so mother is satisfied.  That makes this weekend more then superb.  Next weekend will probably be more so what with Gabe coming down from Seattle and Chris’s grad. Party.    It’s late now though, and as much as I feel like drifting, I am gonna go to sleep so I can get to DVC on time tomorrow.  The calc. teacher isn’t as forgiving as Mr. Pardi was.   Later

      Today was a fun day, although not very eventful. Primarily I stayed at home and played a bunch of video games. Yeah, yeah, I know it’s really pathetic, but I don’t rightly care. I had fun anyways, and it doesn’t happen too often. Only the 3 of us, Rod, Jeff and myself, were free today to do stuff. Had we grabbed more people, and had there not been a couch in the back of my van taking up the whole area, we might of gone out somewhere and done something. Real descriptive that passage. Oh well, what the hell.  So the English grade from DVC finally came in, and I got an A in that too. So I am off to a decent start at DVC, with 15 units and a 4.00 GPA, I am actually about a quarter of the way to being able to transfer to Berkeley. I realized though, that the last 8 weeks have passed by in a complete blur. It is hard to believe that I graduated high school two months ago, that I started DVC a month and a half ago, and that most of my friends will be leaving for their schools in about one to one and a half months. Time sure seems to whiz by. If this “rate” continues, two years will be gone before I know it. That is a somewhat heartening thought.  Last post I was talking about regret. I mentioned that I essentially regret the past four years of my life. This is because there were many many things I wanted to do, that I could have done had I planned on going to DVC. By the same token, if I had done just a little more as in studied a little harder and taken a couple of different or extra classes, I could have been admitted to Berkeley for the Fall. However, it is dangerous to fall into that trap of wondering what might have been if I had done certain things differently. Instead, those who prevent themselves from being consumed by their regret view the past slightly differently. The best way to deal with regret is to – though it does sound awfully clichéd –learn from ones mistakes.  One of the morals of Fitzgerald’s,  The Great Gatsby , is that no matter how hard one may try, it is impossible to recreate the past. While for old Gatsby this had to do primarily with recreating the love he and Daisy shared, the idea is not limited to human emotions. I have always felt that my sophomore year was my best year in high school. I was very dedicated that year and I was always able to focus and work on the task at hand. I did all the homework, studied hard sometimes, and most importantly, never was lazy about the work. Sure I still did my old wait-till-the-last-minute thing on essays and stuff. However I always came through when it mattered the most. Also, my mind was crystal clear as far as girls went. I was especially fond of the girl who sat behind me in math, and she liked me a lot too. I never went out with her because, as I mentioned earlier, it wasn’t until very recently that I stopped giving a damn what my parents think on this matter. Even though I didn’t go out with her, I sad about it; I was basically happy and productive the whole school year. Now during my junior and senior years, I always felt like I was underperforming. I didn’t want to study any more, and I couldn’t force myself the way I did in my sophomore year. Some of my friends say that it sounds like I burned myself out after my second year in high school. Whatever the case, the point is that I thought to myself for the first half of junior year, “I should try and recreate my mindset from my last year.” I always was trying to make things like they were in the past. Well, it didn’t work, and when I read that line from  Gatsby , I realized it was completely true.  It is very important in life to learn from past mistakes and move on. Instead of dwelling on how life should be, we need to understand the mistakes made in the past and understand how to prevent those mistakes from being repeated in the future. I have had, I suppose, my moping time for the past 8 weeks. I know what I did wrong and I know what I should have done differently. Now, I intend to push ahead with my future at DVC and wherever I go afterwards while remembering, but not obsessing over, the errors I made which have landed me here.  So for a few matters of bookkeeping: I finally mailed Gabe’s controller and game out today, so you can expect that in about a week. Also, the distance from my house to Century 16 is 4.2 miles. The distance from my house to Brenden 14 is 4.2 miles. That’s’ that. Lastly, I apologize to anyone reading this blog for the bitch session that just occurred. I had said once that I would try not to do that because I so often get annoyed at other people who seem to just perpetually complain because most everybody condones it and sympathizes with them. My mom taught me to not whine, so I am sorry for what I posted earlier. Still, I guess I kinda feel better now that it is out. I had found that I was rather high-strung all the time, and was getting seriously angry easier then usual. Now, hopefully, I will be more calm for more time, or else one of my friends may end up seriously injured. I almost turned around when Jason made that comment the other day, but luckily my sense prevailed and I didn’t punch him out. So maybe I can keep my temper in check. Perhaps some fun driving will help. If not though, oh well, what the hell. Other people will be in trouble. I will be happy as a clam.           M0nKi35 R 73h C001 -The Maz

           I have decided to start going by The Maz again since so many people still call me that.  I believe it had all started way back in freshman year when Bob-o chanted, “Da Maz” during brunch.  The nickname just sort of stuck.  What is odd, though, is that “The Maz” is a longer name then Maz, which is a nickname for Mazhar.  Oh well.      So the grade for one of my DVC classes is in.  I got an A in calculus, which is no surprise because calculus at NG was much more intense then DVC calc.  I was prepared very well by my favorite bald hobbit, Mr. Gishe.  Unfortunately the English grade still hasn’t come in, but I am confident I earned an A in that class as well.  More unfortunately though, is that I have a total of 17 transferable units to Berkeley now, and the minimum requirement for concurrent enrollment at UCB is 20 units.  So I will have to wait until the spring to take classes a Berkeley.  Oh well, I guess.  Nothing can be done.      The summer semester at DVC is officially over now, and so is that thing with “that asian girl”.  Actually, it was over before it even started.  You see, on Wednesday, the day after we had lunch and all, I was walking with her again to what I presumed was her car.  When we got to the parking lot, the second level one on the Viking Road side of the school, she walked up to a car that was idling on the side and opened the door.  I was kind of surprised, but then I saw her parents were picking her up.  So she introduced me to her mother and father and we said goodbye and she left.  The next day, Thursday, the day of the final, I asked her if she wanted to see a movie that night.  The answer I got, well, the irony is so thick you couldn’t cut with a fucking machete.  She tells me that she can’t because her parents are only going to allow her to date Asian guys, and that I should agree that it would kind of stereotypical if she started going out with an Indian guy.  So yeah, English sucked balls.  Bah monkey.       Friday was a good day; I went out with Rod, Nikhil, Ray, and Jason in my van around town.  We had some fun on speed bumps, and a little dangerous driving, and we also saw that new movie Collateral.  It was actually surprisingly good for the first 1.5 hours.  In fact, I will go so far as to say that I really liked it for the first 1.5 hours.  The end, however, was one of the worst endings to any movie.  It dragged, and almost seemed Hindi movie styling with the Hero doing things we was incapable of doing earlier, and overall just being unrealistic.  Still, I would recommend it to most people because it was a fun viewing.  Also, that new movie, The Village, was REALLY good, and I would recommend it to everybody.  The directing was superb, the plot fantastic, and the acting was very convincing and realistic.  Everybody ought to see that movie.  After I dropped everybody off, Jeff, Bro and I went to Arbalado and played tennis.  I tried and out and am going to have to practice a lot to get used to my new racket.  I have decided though, that I rather like tennis, even though I am not very good at it yet.  It is a fun, active sport that reminds me a lot of baseball and golf in terms of body motion.  Most of all though, I just like to get out and do something physical, because it takes a lot of coercing to get my group of friends away from the T.V. screen.       Today I went golfing with my brother, since it is his birthday.  I had an average round and shot 43 on a par 32 9-hole course.  We would have played more but mom was making…er…how do you spell it…Biryanni.  It is a fantastic, possibly my favorite, Indian dish comprised of meat, rice and…well stuff that makes it taste really great.  Also, since my mom is a gourmet cook, the food tastes especially good.  Thus my brother and I decided to only play 9 holes and come back for Dunch (Dinner and Lunch my brother calls Dunch, though I believe Duncher would be more accurate).  I totally pig-ed out and ended up lazing with my brother on the couch for a couple of hours while we watched to Agassi – Roddick match which was awesome.  Andy Roddick has 13 years on Andre Agassi, but Agassi still won.  It was an extremely close match, and turned into a classic, “Nothing beats experience” match as Agassi managed to return Rodick’s 135-140 mph serves by predicting where the ball was going to be hit.  He returned more of Rodick’s serves then anyone else ever has, in the whole world.  The match was really impressive and fun to watch.       Well, that about sums up the last few days for me.  I am still pretty annoyed about Jamie, but oh well.  What did get me annoyed the most this weekend was when a “friend”, I am not so sure of that, of mine and I were arguing about whether Century 16 or Brenden 14 was closer to my house.  I wanted to go to Brenden 14 because I don’t like to take my van out any farther then I have to.  I have always felt more at ease at the Brenden theater over the Century because I have been going there for around 5 or 6 years, and I know several auto garages nearby that I have visited while trying to fix my van.  I didn’t want to go out to Pleasant Hill, but he did.  However, I was driving and decided to go to Brenden instead.  So we argued over which theater was closer for a while, and at one point he got fairly annoyed because he has this sort of obsessive compulsive thing about being right.  I was walking with Nikhil up to the restroom and said, “dude give it a rest.  Brenden is probably closer, and we are already here.”  He responded by saying, “No Century is closer.  You’re just an idiot, which is why you are going to DVC.” Well, at the moment I just sort of laughed and continued on my way, but the comment is lingering with me.  It makes me wonder how much crap I am going to get from people for the next two years.  For the next ten years.  Shit, for the rest of my life.  I still hope to go into acadamia; I hope to do research.  I already know I am going to have to work far harder then most people now to get a decent position because the academic community is real snobby and looks down on community colleges.  Sure, people say, “The degree will only say Berkeley”.  That’s nice, but in an interview for any relevant position at any relevant institution, they will know my whole history.  They will see two years worth of DVC on the transcript.  A simple comment like Jason’s said in the heat of an argument isn’t as easily forgotten as it seems at first.  When he said it, it was no joke.  His tone was serious, and his meaning was very clear.  People often pass off rude comments as jokes, but their reason for making the “joke” is not light-hearted.  In a few months, during ramzan, I will meet again with the local muslim groups I associate with.  They are already asking where I am going to college, comparing with their own children.  In India, all my relatives ask where I will be going to college, even though believe they already know the answer.  I am supposed to be going to Berkeley like my brother and studying medicine.  Well.  I suppose a lot of people are going to be disappointed.       Mr. Tillian, the biology teacher at Northgate, didn’t even believe that I was accepted into UCLA.  I had to take the acceptance letter to school to prove it to him.  I wonder if I will have to walk around with the damn thing stapled to my back so that people quit thinking I am a lying moron.  Come to think of it, I haven’t actually shown the letter to any of my friends.  Next time Jeff comes over, since he is going to UCLA, I will have to show him the letter to prove it to him.  That way at least one my friends will believe me.  I wonder though…what would I be proving?  That I am not a total fool because I got into UCLA?  Or that I am a total fool for not going to UCLA?  Or Cal Poly, or Davis.       When you look back on a particular time in your life, you hope you can remember the time with pride, or joy, or at least without anger, or regret.  Regret can destroy a person; it generates a most powerful feeling of sorrow coupled with an equally strong desire for time to go back.  Everyone wishes for a second chance, another try to do things, “right”.  I know people who have wasted away while they occupied themselves with dreams of what they could have done and of what they could have been.  Regret is deadly and dangerous.  Unfortunately, everyone lives with regrets, thought the majority don’t allow themselves to be consumed by them.  Some do though, some do.  We hear about them on the news almost daily.  Some regret the way they treated their spouses, their children, hell I have even heard people wishing they took better care of their pets.  Other people regret not working hard enough, or taking the easy way out.  I have seen people regret whole parts of their lives.  I wonder…am I too young for regret?  I would doubt so.  At 17 years of age, though, I wonder how much regret I should feel.  Perhaps it is too much to regret four years of my life.  Indeed, it is probably too much to feel that almost a quarter of my life was completely wasted.  I am definitely too young to feel that I have spent four years working towards absolutely nothing.  At 17, I am supposed to feel happy and self-important.  Not this.  I wonder…how I managed to amount to nothing after four years.  It was four years ago I said that I would make it out.  Three years ago I said I would go away.  Two years ago I swore I would leave this place.  Just last year I remember saying that I would “be somebody, someday”.  I am off to a great start.  All of this thinking for the past four years has made me only one thing.  I am the only kid I know with wrinkles in their forehead.       It is 1:00am.  I am tired.  I will save part 2 for some other night.  Until then, regretfully yours (J/K) -The Maz

                  Today was a good day.  In school, I got another perfect on my Calc. quiz, but that is the boring part.  More interestingly I met a friend of mine who I hadn’t seen in about a year.  I have known him since I was maybe…4 or 5 years old.  We are friends through our parents and we got to know each other through Ramadan Iftar parties.  He lives in Richmond and is now starting DVC too.  It was interesting to talk to him because, though we are friends and all, we come from very different backgrounds.  Also, his highschool experience can hardly relate to mine.  As much as Northgate was a prison, all of us graduates are academically prepared, and all of us Aperiod people still get up at 6:00am.  He went to El Ceritto high and is much less prepared for DVC then me.  He is actually struggling with computer science and pre-calc.  It makes me feel kinda sorry for him because I know he is not dumb, just never really had serious schooling.  So I stayed after school for about one and a half hours to help him with pre-calc. since he has a chapter test tomorrow.  With any luck, he will ace it.              The other part of my day, which made it a really really nice day, was that “that Asian girl” agreed to have lunch with me.  She didn’t feel like walking very far because her friend keeps on hanging around, so we went to the cafeteria and got some food.  Then we went out to the duck pond and had lunch.  Luckily her friend decided not to come with us this time, as I might have thrown her into the pond if she foiled my plans again.  I am starting to become rather fond of, as jeff calls her, “that Asian girl”.  This is sort of a problem for me because, well this may sound prejudiced, but Indian guys are often made fun of for going out with Asian girls.  I believe this is because Asian chicks are WAY more like Indian girls then white girls, and the cultures are fairly close.  The basic values and ideas are the same between Asians and Indians.  I think this is why I tend to associate more with Asians then Whites.  I understand them and they understand me better.  So the thing is that it is kind of stereotypical for an Indian guy in America to go out with an Asian girl in America, because Indian guys generally don’t go after white girls.  There is a whole OTHER stereotype for that I could go into, but this isn’t the time.              Anyways, my point is that going out with “that Asian girl”, that is fucking hilarious jeff, is rather…complicated.  Then again, being a muslim Indian, going out with any girl is fucking complicated.  When your cousins, aunts and uncles are already scouting for potential brides in another country, dating becomes very complicated very fast.  I have been approached a couple of times about that whole arranged marriage thing and it went something like, “It’s not like your forced to marry a girl we pick, it is just that we are going to select a group of girls for u to choose from”.  “And if I don’t want to choose any of the girls from the group?” “You can marry whoever you want you know.  We are just trying to give you guidelines.” “I get a limited choice?  That’s not, ‘whoever you want’” “Don’t be so difficult, we are just trying to help” “Help what?  I am fifteen.” “Exactly.  You don’t have too much time left” “Are you insane? I am fifteen.  I don’t want to fricking think about this yet” “All of you family members have followed their relative’s decisions and recommendations.  You are a member of this colony and you will follow our traditions.  So don’t go fooling around with any one here.” “There goes my fun” “Go to your room” And people sometimes wonder why I am silent or bitter when they talk about marriage and the like.  But oh well, what the hell.  For the past 3 months I have expanded my “fuck it” doctrine to include that discussion, so I suppose it shouldn’t really be a problem.  Hehe, the other day Kashy told me I wasn’t open enough with other people.  Well, I normally don’t like talking about my problems.  It has always seemed to me like a sort of a weakness.  However, I haven’t exactly gotten far, have I?  Let’s try out her idea of, “talking about it”.  Certainly can’t hurt anything.  I hope.   Until the next ranting…             The Maz
