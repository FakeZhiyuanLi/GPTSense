      Okay, so I'm sitting here in my grad class and I'm supposed to be 'free versing'.  I'm no poet, (or rapper) so instead, I sit here and add to my aging blog.  I will be ecstatic when I FINALLY have my masters and will no longer have to subject myself to these annoying classes.  Our professor just set us free for 45 minutes to write poetry which she'll never check.  Umm, yeah, okay, I'll get right on that.  I'm going to Peoria tonight to meet Adam and Liz for dinner.  Should be a good time. I'm fired up for the weekend. My ankle is on the mend, even though it's bruised like a mother right now.  I'm still not COMPLETELY convinced that it's not broken, but seeing as how I've played volleyball on it, worked out, and walked back and forth to class all week, I'm kind of doubting it.  I should proably pack up and head back to that fun classroom. One last note, if Kevin shows up to a social event this week and he's maimed, it's because he ate the last banana cake that he promised to me and I'm not very happy with him right now.  REPENT!

      So, we've been married for 5 days now.  It's working out pretty good thus far, which is good.  Plus, our celibacy stint is now over as well, and that also rules.  Our honeymoon kind of sucks, however, because I am in the middle of a grad class and Kevin is about to start his job at the nameless cell phone company.  (Thank you, Tison!  Kisses!)  Oh well, we're looking to jet off in August. Something for us to look forward to, right?  I'm about to go hose myself off now, 'cause word on the street is that we're heading to Fat Jacks.  Peace out.

      This is my second blog post in two days.&nbsp; All of a sudden I'm all over this shit.&nbsp; I just thought you would all be happy to know that I feel like a million bucks today.&nbsp; All remnants of my hangover have disappeared, thank God.&nbsp; It was pretty rough for awhile there yesterday.&nbsp; Today I'm headed down to HEYWORTH, ILLINOIS, YEE HAW!&nbsp; To start getting my classroom back into some sort of order.&nbsp; Since it's not 8,000,000 degrees outside today, I guess it's a good day to do it.&nbsp; I'm excited about seeing the Bourne Supremacy sometime this week, quite possibly tonight.&nbsp; Anyone seen it yet?&nbsp; Any comments?

      So, I always bitch at Kevin for just posting negative, unhappy blogs, but I am also guilty of doing this.&nbsp; I was SOOO incredibly hungover today that it was just ridiculous.&nbsp; I don't know what I did last night to get so bombed, I didn't even realize I was that drunk until I stumbled in the door and just fell down on the carpet.&nbsp; I was bowing down to the porcelain God many a time this morning and spent my day on the couch with a big glass of water&nbsp;watching the Cardinals and an 'I Love the 80's' marathon.&nbsp; Rough stuff.&nbsp; On the upside, Tison's party was fun and it seems like everyone had a good time, so that's cool.&nbsp;   We're leaving for our honeymoon next Tuesday!&nbsp; How fun is that?&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly what we're going to do, but it should be a good time. Boston rocks.&nbsp; We had a blast&nbsp;last time we were there.&nbsp; I can't wait to get away for awhile.&nbsp; I only have about four weeks before I have to go back to work!&nbsp; That sucks!&nbsp; I probably don't ge t a lot of sympathy from most people, but damn, this summer has gone by FAST.&nbsp; And what do I have to show for it?&nbsp; About ten extra pounds, 6 credit hours closer to my masters and a new last name.&nbsp; Not too shabby I guess.&nbsp; I'm off to continue recovering.&nbsp;

      So, we're FINALLY going on our honeymoon, a month and a half later!  That's okay though, 'cause it's given us something to look forward to all summer.  The weather for  the Boston area looks amazing for the next week, so we're gonna bring it.  We'll be coming back next Tuesday late at night, if anyone cares.  Tison is on my shitlist right now, as is Sprint and US Cellular.  It took me THREE F-ing days to get my new phone working.  A major part of that is because Tison put in Kevin's old number to port into my phone instead of MY number.  It's an easy mistake to make because the numbers were just one digit off from each other, but that one tiny mistake proceeded to make my life a living nightmare from that point on.  Customer Service LICKS ASS.  That's all I have to say about that.  Oh, and yeah, my new phone charger doesn't work either. GREAT.  I'm off to pack and run a million errands now.  Have a fantastic week all of you working fools!  =)  (I have less than three weeks before I have to go back to school!!! AGGGGGGHHHHH!)
