      Awhile back there was an add campaign in which a group of sports figures were arguing as to what made a particular beer more appealing. Half thought it was because it was less filling and the other because it tasted better. The differences between CF & CFL are much more compelling. Here I blow off some steam and have a few laughs- there I deal with the realities of being Disabled, Homebound and Alone. Right now we are in the middle of an email campaign aimed at Gov. Jeb Bush and the 48 million dollars he has deleted from Disabled Services. If you've gotten a smile over something written here please consider going to CF Official and aiding us an email campaign to restore services and aid the Disabled.   Thank You, Elaine AKA CF.

      You ever notice that a company will grab hold of an advertising campaign and will continue to use it long after it has begun to bore the rest of us to death?  For my Mom its the Victoria's Secrets adds where the woman are all in six inch stilletos with great big fluffy Angel wings and the latest in bondage lingerie.  It''s not the shoes, it's not even the underwear-  it's the damn wings.  Of course this comes from a woman who feels that, "Christ did not hang on the Cross so he could hang off someone's bumper 2000 years later!"  With me it's that damn Verizon commercial which they show, from my own exhaustive studies, at least 3 times  for every 20 minutes of actual programming they manage to squeeze in amongst what used to be car commercials.  By that I mean the post modernism, monuments of art house flick pretension with the pseudo Jack Keroac  dialog  they use to sell you a Saturn.  My favorite of those was the one with James Garner  narrating a poem off camera that sounded like an  A.A. Milne version of Beat Poetry.   Everytime that one showed up I got flash backs of Pooh in a coffee house wearing a black beret and I've never dropped acid.  However, this man makes me want to lob something at the television just so he will shut the Hell Up before I hurt some one.  Since he's so interested in seeing the world, 3 steps at a time, I decided we could at least give the guy a more interesting itinerary.  Especially if  we could get a little pay back in process.  So here's the  Poll from my Official site:  NEXT STOP FOR THE VERIZON GUY: A.  Doing 5 to 10 in the Big House for Stalking. B.  Marooned with James Earl Jones on a Verizon Survivors Island. C.  He gets caught in an avalanche he set off by saying, "Can You Hear Me Now?" D.  The mouth of an active volcano. E.   Back on his medications so he'll shut up.  If you want your vote to count you'll need to follow CF Official link to the Poll and vote there.  Well, tomorrow you get the answer to yesterday's ''X Factor".

          Okay I'll admit it. This is where I go to vent and not be the OFFICIAL CABIN FEVER. More like Cabin Fever Lite. It's just that I have too much time alone to think. After awhile you either sleep all day, watch talk shows or go blind from reading. I do watch more TV than I used to. When Dan was alive it was hardly on at all. The first year was just a blur of emotion and trying to get the feeling back in my right arm. Plus I was always sort of observant. I always was a little distant from the world watching what happening and wondering why people do the things they do. The month before he died Dan and I watched Chris Rock, Eddie Izzard and Dennis Miller. And something was said in each of their shows that has plagued me ever since I heard it. With CR it was, "Can't you just be crazy anymore? Did we eliminate crazy from the dictionary?" EI was wondering why a guy named Jerry Dorsey would change his name to Englebert Humperdink and confessed that "What sort of mind thinks something like that up? How did he get here from there mentally and what kind of mind takes that trip." Then DM, God bless him, is a man whose wit is so dry that the polar ice cap recedes a few inches every time he travels to Canada. Yet this is a man who backed Ross Perot for President, voluntarily moved his family to Paris and still was smart enough to remark "Did anyone besides me notice that Evian is naive spelled backwards?" Holy Mother of God some one besides me found that just too precious for words!      Most people worry about the Anti-Christ being a man from the Middle East who will wear a blue beret and take over the world. Me, I'm more worried about the guy wearing Dockers, driving an SUV and willing to crawl over the bloody dismembered bodies of his co-workers trying to make partner before he's 45. Go figure.      You know,even though I have 3 blogs that serve very different purposes I'm really confused by all of this code stuff. RSS... XMS...Who gives a S**. I do realize that in actuality this is watching a language being born. I try to imagine what it must have been like the moment when the first word in the first language was spoken. I wonder what it was, when it was and what was going on in the mind of the person who said it. Picture a bunch of shaggy men loping through the bushes doing the hunting part of hunter-gatherer society. What made one of them suddenly think, "Screw grunting all the time. From now on my name is Joe. I like that sound. It's a good sound. It's a nice, trustworthy sound. And damn it if I don't feel that I am the perfect type of a guy that makes a Joe who he is and what a he stands for."      Then, of course, First Joe would have had to make an announcement. "Hey everybody, when you want to grunt at me from now on you need to say 'Hey Joe' to get my attention." Then I began to think about all the little things we attach language to. Before language did people dream without a dialog? Did they sign things out or did they grunt? What went on when they were taking that first important bathroom break of the day? Was a day dream like being in a silent movie?      That last part led me to ponder the origin of my obsession with origins in general. I came to the conclusion that all this can be laid squarely at the feet of Algebra. But you're going to have to wait until tomorrow to find out why.      If you're wondering why, you'll just have to ask Joe.

        As if you were born into a world of tears, you always tend to look at the darker things in life. Inside you crave attention yet push away society, and you're a hopeless romantic.

        You are naturally born with a gift, whether it be poetry, writing or song. You love beauty and creativity, and usually are highly intelligent. Others view you as mysterious and dreamy, yet also bold since you hold firm in your beliefs.    urlLink  What Type of Soul Do You Have ?   brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   I know that I am a bit strange.

      Oh yeah, I was ranting about was going on in people's minds when they came up with various and sundry ideas.  When I last left you I was pondering the idea of language, a hypothetical caveman named Joe and what was going through his mind when he invented something to replace the grunts and hoots that had worked just fine for people up until that point.  Now I realize that wondering about the 'why' in why people come up with ideas that become Law on a Cosmic Scale sounds like I have WAY too much time on my hands.  That's because I do have way too much time on my hands.  Being Homebound will do strange things to you but I have to be honest and admit that my obsession about the origin of ideas came from Algebra way back in Junior High School.  Up until that class, plain old arithmetic had suited me just fine, thank you very much.  Now I have some one telling me that instead of 2 we were going to use 'x'.  I thought about it for a minute and then I got up the nerve to ask the teacher, "Why?  What's wrong with 2? If I go to the store and ask for 2 of something they're not going to give me 10 so why do I need to cloud the issue with a letter instead of a number?"  That's when I got hit with what I personally consider the Mother of All Pseudo-Intellectual Answers of The Ages.  I’m not going to bore you with the details, lets just say that the reason was that the Language of Mathematics is a universal medium by which a guy from Russia could discuss the formula for rocket fuel with a guy from Germany even if they couldn't speak each others language.  Now, at 14 I never had an occasion  where I had to share the formula for a new and improved rocket fuel with anyone and I really didn’t anticipate it ever happening. However, I couldn’t say with any degree of moral certainty that it never would come up I figured there that I might as well be prepared for it. Besides, I had to pass the class.  I did see trouble up a head when I was told that in the next PROBLEM ‘x’ wasn’t going to stand in for 2 again.  Now it was 11.  First of all, anything  referred to as a problem is not a good thing.  Have you ever met anyone who was thrilled to have a problem of any sort in their life?  Did you ever envy someone’s problem and wish you had one just like it?  No, because we all know that problems are to be avoided unless, of course, they are being forced upon you by a Math Teacher.  That exalted personage that has the Power of The Grade and the ability to screw your GPA right out of the college of your choice.  They’ve got you and they know that you know that they will be working out some of their little anxieties by smirking while they assign the even numbered problems when the only answers in the back of the book are for the odds.  The most heinous aspect of Mathematics is that the people who teach it know that they are wasting your time.  They know, because they’re into numbers, that the chance of someone EVER calling you in the middle of the night panic stricken at the thought of not knowing what the square root of 144 is, are about the same as you winning the Lotto every week for a year.  I started out pissed off at the man who thought ‘x’ was a good idea but now I’m really torqued at all the hours I spent playing make believe and wasting reams of paper.  I’ve been places where I people spoke a different and not once did The Universal Language of Mathematics and good ol’ ‘x’ did me absolutely no good when I was looking for the Bathroom.  Do you think we should let future generations of would-be Rocket Scientists in on the joke or should we let them find out the hard way?  You’re right- they'll figure it out while they're looking for the nearest tree! P=  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever

      OD 33: My Arm to Yours!  Comments:  2 Date:  12/27/03 at 1:31PM (3h7m ago)    Mood: STILL HAPPY BUT BACK ON TRACK  Playing: MICHELLE BRANCH - ALL YOU WANTED  Achairde All:  I'm still buzzing from the great Christmas I had, my Mom visiting and all the emails, comments, ISM’s, AIM/Messenger, etc. chats and CB Posts I've received. I've gotten a few questions about my addition to my traditional closing by including "My Arm to Yours". There is an expression in the Irish, which English doesn't touch. It means Today Is A Good Day to Die/I Might Fall In Battle But I'm Taking As Many of The Bastards With Me As I Can/I Pledge My Sword to Yours In This Fight and Beyond and it is sworn by The Threefold Oath. "May the Sky Fall Upon Me, May the Earth Swallow Me and May the Sea Cover Me Should I Forsake My Vow." Now since, that's a lot to type every time I end a Post or ISM or Whatever I have skinnied it down to "My Arm to Yours".  Make no mistake, getting 42-million dollars in benefits back is going to be a Battle and many of you have pledged your own Oaths to me to see it out to the end, bitter or sweet as it may be. So, I in turn, owe you and "For Those Who Cannot Speak" my own Oath in return. That's the best I can explain it so I hope it's enough.  For those who don't know how we can pull this off I say, "Don't worry chara, we will." As someone who worked Ireland and the AIM with me before the drunk took a left turn through my brain remarked, "You are, arguably, the WORST person they could have told to move out of Florida." I get a lot of emails from friends and family who usually end with, "You know, I know you and I could almost feel sorry for Jeb Bush. Almost but not quite!"  I am starting work on the Food Chain today and will hopefully have it done by Monday in time for mailing. I know this sounds like 'Computer Heresy" but a good Food Chain starts with "snail mail". The Food Chain is a term I made up, whereby you start with your Mayor, your County Council, your State reps, your US reps, the Governor of your state and then the President. You write one letter, changing names where you need to and make sure that the bottom reads cc: EVERYONE you wrote! This way all the politicians will know other politicians are aware that you have activated your entire political system. This will cause the more intelligent of them to realize that if they don't do the right thing it's going to be fodder for the opposition when the election rolls around. We get an added bonus this year because, pardon my language, but screw New Hampshire- this time every one is going to be watching Florida like a Hawk.  I am also adding the Mayor of D.C. because he was really great about my request to move back there, a woman from Channel Eight TV here in Tampa and a friend who works for the Washington Post. My sister is working for Dean's Campaign and I'm sure she will share our information with his staff who will get it to him.   For those who live outside of the USA the Foodchain means writing our President, copying your President or Prime Minister and sending a copy to the US Ambassador to your country. A move that will guarantee that the US State Department gives the US President hives.  Then on Der Tag, we all email Jeb Bush on the issue at the same time. We need a minimum of 20,000 emails which is easier than it sounds because I write an email which you can cut and paste or write your own and because if your five friends tell five friends, etc. geometric progression kicks in.  You know what's funny, Jeb's Press Secretary told me that the governor does not respond well to 'threats' when I briefly outlined our Campaign to her- THEY CUT MY STATE BENEFITS AND I'M THE ONE DOING THE THREATENING?!?! They cut them back in October of 2003, which is when I started asking questions. Just a coincidence, yeah right! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out I was being punished for speaking out. The other prong of the attack is that I file a suit with the US Department of Justice under the "Whistle Blower's Act" even though I don't work for the State of Florida. Several attorneys are willing to argue that the Act discriminates against the Disabled under the "Americans With Disabilities Act" or ADA. Even if I don't make my burden of proof, which I think I will, it should generate some interesting comments from the Press.  So that's where we are and I am grateful to everyone with us in our "For Those Who Cannot Speak" Email Campaign. Just remember you've got to Agitate! Educate! and Organize!  Slan leat, My Arm to Yours- Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  PS My bad! I forgot to mention that we have a couple of Universities, The Ancient Order of Hibernians, The Knights of Columbus and MC's connection to someone who has some more resources via someone who, "might be able to pull some strings with someone in the (positively massive) Florida Jewish community." Personally I think we will more than exceed the 20,000 we're shooting for and we'll get it done, together! e/cf

       OD 32: MEMORIES...PART TWO. Comments: New Date: 12/26/03 at 5:05PM (1m35s ago)     Mood: VERY BLESSED AND VERY HAPPY  Playing: LO HOW A ROSE ERE BLOOMING  Achairde All:  Thank you to all of those who have been praying for or thinking of my Mom. Even though she is under Hospice Care she drove herself to my house today. We went to the grocery store and Blimpies. She stayed in her car but she made it upstairs to visit with me and Beaureguard (her Grandkitty). We just finished eating and she is taking a wee nap. This is the second time I have physically seen my Mom since July.  The last time was in October and we had a picnic in her car because she couldn't make it up those same stairs. Thank you all and thank you Bright Mother for giving me this time with her. She sat at my computer and she read your comments, ISM's and CB Posts. She wants me to tell you that she is very proud of you and that she prays for each and everyone of you everyday when she says her Rosary. She rold me that you give her hope for the future. She also says that I have great taste in friends and that I should know how lucky I am to have you. (Which I have said before, I will continue to say it and I hope that I've said it often enough to let you know how much I love and respect you guys.)  Thank you for that, thank you for your prayers and thank you God for letting me see my Mom today.  What a wonderful Christmas this has been! I hugged my Mama today.

Achairde All:  I hope that your Holiday is proving to be as wonderful as mine was yesterday. Remember back when I moved from Lycos to here it was to give people who weren't Disabled a real life, real time look at what it's like to be Disabled, Homebound and not a little frightened at a place that wasn't going to tell me your user list is too big- we can't give you data anymore. (FYI they cut off at 10 thousand subscribers and when I left I was over 20.)   Then, somehow it always does, I find myself right in the middle of I raging battle with the government over some Human Rights issue. As Portnoy from 'Bloom County' would say, "Imagine my surprise!" Remember the kid who lived with his grandmother and asked for help back in the 11/3/03 OD 17 - CAN YOU HELP MY GRANDMOTHER? Post? Was I supposed to walk away from that? Hell no, I didn't and My Angels (and you know who you are since the list has grown to 32) didn't and we got a nice thank you note slash Christmas card from them. The services I arranged for them through their Pastor (they didn't have a telephone at the time but they do now) have really made a difference and he is even starting think that College is an Option and not a Dream! We did good, didn't we folks! Damn straight!  Now we've got Jeb Bush on the ropes. Big organizations such as the Knights of Columbus, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and a few Universities are starting to get on board with us. I mean US; this is not a Cabin Fever problem this is the "FTWCS" Issue. If you're new it means "For Those Who Cannot Speak". We chose that name because these are some of our country's citizens who cannot or are physically unable to Advocate for themselves. They are suffering physically and mentally from a 42 million-dollar cut in Disability services. A cut, we were assured by the Florida Clearing House For The Disabled, would never happen! Mindcandy has some more resources he hopes to bring out. To quote him he knows someone who, "might be able to pull some strings with someone in the (positively massive) Florida Jewish community." We'll get it done, together.   By that, and I don't mean to presume, I think this shows just how very special Modblog, it's Administrators and members are. We don't flame, we great newcomers and when someone here yells, "Help!" we all come running. Everyday, in this one small corner of the Net Universe, we prove that computers bring people together instead of turning us into loner geeks who don't have a 'real life'!  But back to the Day In The Life Stuff, yesterday was the happiest day that I have had since Dan died and one of the happiest I've had in 44 years of living. I went to his folks, I met his Grandpa for the first time (he lives in Alaska) and got 'adopted even though he's too 'young' to have a grand-daughter my age'. (I even let him take two pictures of me and I NEVER let people take my picture. My father is a professional photographer without one photo of moi!) I met so many great people from his Dad's side of the family along with seeing the wonderful one's I already knew on his Mom's. His Dad's family are 'huggers' and if you know anything about the Irish side of my family you know that we hug you when you come in the door and we hug you out. In fact, we may just hug you in between because hugs are most wonderful means of physical communication between people in the world.  Hugs aren't just for lovers or spouses or family members. Hugs are one human being showing another that they are glad you are in their life. That they're a little bit happier, their burdens are a wee bit lighter and that they laugh a little more just because you!  So, Blessed Solstice, Happy Chanukah, Merry Christmas and a Great Kwanza to you and yours!  Plus :::::HUGS TO ALL::::: from me. You really didn't think that I was going to let you leave without one, did you? LOL  Cead Mile Failte! Nollaigh Mait Duit! Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever

      Mood: BLESSED WITH FRIENDS Playing: MANCINI - SILVER BELLS  Ohhhhh Jeb Bush is in trouble now. My Mom is REALLY, REALLY angry. Trust me when I say, devoutly, that my Mom is one little Irish Catholic lady you SO DO NOT WANT TO PISS OFF! I've faced a lot of scary things in 44 years but even I won't take her on! Angry FBI agents, ticked off Treasury agents, City/County Cops and large men who do not share my Humanitarian views...BRING 'UM ON! But that is one place even I won't go.   Back before Hospice Mom used to take me to the doctors. After seeing the same woman through all of the things that have happened in nine years we have become 'sort of friends'. She had been very sick so I asked her, "Cheryl did you go to the Pulmonary doctor?" She mumbled something that sounded a whole lot like yes/no/maybe/I don't know.  This was not the correct answer so I brought out 'the big guns' and turned to say just one word, "Mom?"  My mother, swear to God, says, "Look me in the eye!" to Dr. Reed. That's it, no speech, no yelling just that one phrase.  Dr. Reed turned bright red, COULD NOT look my Mom in the eye and said, "I'll make the appointment today."  Mom gave her "THE LOOK" and mildly replied, "See that you do!"  She also send her thanks and appreciation for all the support you folks give me, as her daughter. She also appreciates your willingness to help the Disabled, the Elderly and the Homebound.  So, CEAD MILE FAILTE! NOLLAIGH MAIT DUIT! (Which in the Irish means, "One Hundred Thousand Welcomes!

      Newest Blogs:  I'VE HAD A TOUCH OF DEATH SO PLEASE EXCUSE ALL THE POSTINGS AT ONCE.  E/CF 12.23.2004     OD 30: TODAY IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE Comments: New Date: 12/23/03 at 12:19PM (3h23m ago)    Mood: FOR THE LIGHT   Playing: SILLY WIZARD: THE SECRET PORTRAIT  Thank you all for writing. Yesterday was very bad for me in so very many ways: The Social Security letter; my on going fight for Social Services and our FTWCS email campaign; the rudeness of the Governor's Press Aide Alia Feraj; the sudden reappearance of my Annulled Uber-Ex and his fiancee to retrieve boxes he left in my storage closet years ago; the fact that in honor of Daniel did I would not let him in the house and Anda and I had to empty the closet of boxes and go through many of them to make sure he got everything (a trip down memory lane that included more Dan then him since it was a lot of Christmas stuff) also it's damn cold here; I did wish them all the best, love as Daniel and I had it but with many more years than we had as a couple; I almost died on December 5th and my body was not ready for the stress and strain of moving heavy things (actually it never is, that's a Dr. Reed no-no for me) and there are still boxes to be put back; my ongoing issues with Mom and her being under Hospice Care; the fact that 20 years ago this month I was with HER mother when she died and I was the one who had to say (according to her wishes) no to the life support and to top it all off I tried a truce with Sister Tampa because of the situation with our Mother and she told me no, that I am a failure and Jennifer would tell me if there was time but I'd better start saving for cab fare because she won't come for me to be at Mom's side. Add all that to the physical withdrawal I encountered because I quit MS Contin (morphine sulfate) cold turkey after 5 years at 30 mgs 4 times a day, the fact that I will only allow them to give me Darvocet and the pain from all the lifting and bending yesterday and you will understand that I hurt so badly that after I wrote you all last night all I could do was lay on the sofa and cry. I do not cry about such things, I never have, but last night my body made me cry 'Uncle'.  But I had you, all of you, my Mother is still here, Jennifer is still here and Dan's family loves me. Besides all of that I have lobbied for the Unification of Ireland, Leonard Peltier and the AIM and have written reams of articles and pamphlets on Plastic Bullets, Political Torture and the rape of female Political Prisoners for over 20 years. I knew deep down in my heart that I could never walk away because I never have- not in the face of governmental intimidation, threats of unemployment because of my actions on Human Rights or actual physical threats from very large men who did not like me standing on a picket line holding a sign that made statements that they did not agree with.  I can't leave the people here in Florida who do not have anyone to speak for them. Hence the title of our campaign- "For Those Who Cannot Speak". But I also know that I can't do it alone and hard as it was for my stubborn self to actually ask for help it was worse then the pain. We're agreed then? I stay here and we fight it out. We make them cry 'Uncle' this time. That includes those of you live outside of the United States. Never underestimate the power of you writing the White House and copying your President or Prime Minister AND if you copy the US Ambassador to your country I guarantee the US State Department will give our Presidents the hives!  So we do this. We fight because it is the right thing to do. We fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. We fight, in honor, for a 63 year old woman who is dying and leaves a legacy to my family and yours that tells us, "If you don't like it what are you prepared to do about it?" Okay, Mary Agnes Therese, you started this but now it is your time to rest. Today we take up our weapons and continue the Fight. We will keep the Faith. Trust in us Mama, we won’t betray what you have taught us.  Slan leat- My Arm to Yours, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  *In Memory of Daniel Micheal Maier: Warrior, Beloved and Friend.

Playing: MAN O WAR - SIGN OF THE SWORD  Now before we all get worked up about the title of today's Post allow me to tell you it means that you are 'dog-tired'. It is a Southern expression sort of like "Losing my religion." REM did that an we had every pseudo-philosopher speculating that it was a "...cultural cry against the sterility of organized religion." Imagine their chagrin when it turned out that in the South it just means, "Get the Hell away from me before I forget I'm a Christian and hurt you." I must admit those of us who knew what it meant had fun listening to all the 'intellectual speculation'.  Anyway, I am doing better. It's just that Dan's Mom took me shopping yesterday and she actually got me to violate a deeply ingrained principle of mine. NEVER ENTER A DEPARTMENT STORE OR MALL AFTER THANKSGIVING UNTIL EPHIPHANY. Basically because people who are 'On Quest' for that 'must get or die gift' frighten me. I am not all together certain that they do not eat their young on a whim. But she had to wait an hour at the Hospital even though they told her that she could leave now to pick me up. She had a cold, she a supervisor who works full time and she was studying for a Math Final at her college.  There aren't enough 'mea culpas' in the world to make up for that so I would have crawled to Guam if she wanted to go there, cheerfully. Then I, a nice person who sees maybe four or five human beings a month, manage to cause anger and consternation among those who forwarded THAT EMAIL on. I don't understand why- I didn't forward it to anyone. I mean my Mom is elderly, has a dog named Sandy and is under Hospice care. When I volunteered at the Greenbelt Community Center we actually found some of our Senior Citizens trying to pass off cat food as tuna fish because they couldn't afford tuna fish and their Medications. I am sure that we all know where I stand since making Jeb Bush's life a living Hell has been an avocation of mine since October 16th. WHAT DID THEY EXPECT? WHY do people send me things like that when THEY KNOW how I'm going to react? For God's sake People I have a button I used to break out a couple of times a year that reads, "I May Have Cramps But I Can Still Kill You!"  Trust me, I am a firm believer in 'THE WARNING SHOT'. I live my life by the warning shot! But if you STILL want to go there with me I will MAIM you. With absolutely NO REMORSE! Why? Because I warned you, didn't I? So, there I was feeling cold but halfway human, looking forward to Starz "Lord of The Rings" Weekend and there they came. Out of the cheap seats, dribbling! Three of the culprits actually had the nerve to email me to tell me that I was, "insensitive and uncertain of my facts." All I did was hit the 'Reply All' button on Outlook Express. If their name was on the list that was their fault and not mine. Which I informed them.  Now back to the important stuff. You will not believe it but I have had two responses from Mayor of The District of Columbia's Office. If you'll remember I wrote Mayor Anthony A. Williams back on November 30th to tell him that the State of Florida wanted me to move back there because I was born there, have a sister who is a resident and because Florida could not provide me with adequate services. I did not expect a reply. I did it to show Jeb Bush how serious and how far I would go on this issue. The District's first letter on December 8th thanked me for writing and assigned me a Case Number. The second on December 15th sent me all sorts of information on the programs that will be available when I move there. Their Social Services are truly amazing.  The other truly amazing thing is that Social Security is going to take half of my January check out for Medicare premiums that the State of Florida is supposed to be making for me but aren't because they haven't managed to send me a Homebound Social Worker since September 3rd. I won't have food, medicine and some utility money next month because they can't drive seven miles to get the SAME information they've had for NINE years! The District of Columbia sends me two letters and assigns me a case number in a matter of two weeks!  Well charas, I am going to go stretch out on the couch with my cat. Watch Frodo and Company. Eat my Sunday Meals on Wheels Dinner and PRAY no one forwards me anymore emails. I might as well enjoy the TV now- they'll probably cut if off next month for non-payment. Don't you just wish you could be elderly or disabled so you could have this much excitement in your lives?  Yeah right!  I will try to keep the Faith but I'm not making any promises. LOL.  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  PS I will proof read and correct later. I have a cat and a few Hobbits waiting for me.

That is the most revolting thing I've seen in a while.   Whoever thinks that is funny, is part of the problem, rather than part of the "cure".   Feel good horseshit does not equal moral or humanitarian righteousness, no matter the disclaimer. ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ _________ __________ "Lo!

Here is a 'amusing email' that was forwarded to me by someone who should know better (and I'm telling Mom) and my response. If you get it feel free to cut and paste. Send them here mo charas WE know how to deal with them, don't we?    ----- Original Message -----  From: 64 College Educated Lawyers who should know better! To: Sent: Friday, October 31, 2003 9:19 PM Subject: Fw: This is hysterical!    Do This! Its hysterical!! It works!!   I HAD TO SEND THIS ONE!   YOU'LL SEE WHY AT THE END.   An old lady walked into a Grocery Store.   She wanted to buy the best dog food in the world for her little puppy.   She went up to the cash register to buy the food.   The sales-lady told her that the store did not allow old ladies to buy animal food unless they show the actual animal because a lot of old ladies like to eat the animal food themselves.   So, the old lady went home, got her dog and went back to the store to buy her dog food.   The next day she came back to buy the best cat food around.   But the Sales lady told her the same thing, so the old lady went back home and brought her cat to the Grocery Store to buy the cat food.   The next day the old lady went to the Grocery Store again carrying a big container.   She went up to the the sales lady and said, "Put your hand inside here".   The Saleslady shook her head. "NO", she said, "there is probably something in there that will bite me!".   "I promise you that there is nothing in here that will bite you.", the old lady said.   So the Sales lady stuck her hand inside the container and screamed.   To find out what was inside the container you must send it to at least 8 people.   When the computer says your mail has been sent, hit ALT-8 and the container will pop up on your screen.   Now no doubt this is the old lady getting back at the Sales woman. I DO NOT CARE. Because a racist joke is still a racist joke even if the minority in question gets a 'little payback', true?  So, here's my reply:  20 December 03 Tampa, Florida  TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:  I am disabled, on Social Security and Homebound. I am a college educated 44 year old woman with a history of working with Amnesty International, the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the Irish American Unity Conference (IAUC). Since I was hit by a drunk driver 13 years ago I also became an advocate for both Senior Citizens and the Homebound. I write a column, maintain a website, have organized an on-going Email campaign against the 42 million dollar cut in services made by Jeb Bush and I am a Reassurance Caller with Elder Net. I call the Elderly and Homebound everyday to let them know that someone cares. What are YOU doing except sending cruel, disgusting and vile email?  I note that many of you were on my 'Do Not Shop At Walmart' email. While you are feeling righteous about not shopping at a store you probably don't go to anyway I suggest that you GET A LIFE, GET ON BOARD AND HELP THESE PEOPLE IF ONLY FOR THE FACT THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL BE ONE OF US!  Shame on you and everyone who forwarded it on. Responses may be left at my website.  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  Cabin Fever http://cabinfever.modblog.com/  OKAY FOLKS LET'S LOCK AND LOAD!

Well, I am writing but I can't get up on the Net, with my DSL that is. Something went :::uh-oh::: on my DSL line. Earthlink actually said it was their fault and are fixing it. So I figured I'd put the time to good use. CoVad came out and ELN needs to send me a new modem so I am using a 56k connection. It actually makes me want to get out and push! LOL ;-) I missed several days of Postings. Please read the whole thing cause I am not up to answering a lot of "Where have you beens." The sordid tale is below and TRUST ME you have no idea how long the past 13 days have been. Well, here goes:  1. Peristaltic System shut down. Very Bad medicine. 2. Hospital (3 Admissions this year. Cellulitis, Cardiac ICU and this last one.) I think that Hospitals should give Cash Back Bonuses or Frequent Flyer miles. That way I could see New Grange before I die. Just a thought. Anyway I'm such a repeat customer Sandy and my own Mom are about the only ones who even bother to call. AND I checked out with a major cold that I am praying won't turn into my 4th case of Pneumonia. 3. Lease issues, which were resolved. 4. My usual medicine budget was tripled so that left a gap in the food and utilities department. Some help but I need more. Bless You to the Parishioners, Staff and the St. Vincent DePaul Society of St. Mary's RC Church for your continued support. Esp-Anne & Jackie. 5. Having to go 2 places by myself in a cab. Because of my seizures I never go off the property without some one. MAJOR PANIC ISSUES.  6. My favorite sister came down here to surprise Sister Tampa for her birthday and they had a lovely party in one of our larger parks. I wouldn't know because I was not invited. But they said it was quite the Family Gathering. I did call to wish her a Happy Birthday. I got her Voice Mail. Its damn lucky Dan's sister, Theresa, invited me to her parent's house for Christmas or it would be the cat and me. No tree this year. 7. Jennifer was going to come over and help me with my PC because it's getting old. She had lots to do before she went back to D.C. but I wish she could have gotten me some cold medicine or Irish Nyqil (sp?) I keep trying to save up for a Dell or whatever but something always happens. Let's hope it stays together a wee bit longer. Otherwise - I am SO screwed. 8. I quit MS Contin aka Morpine Sulfate after being on it for 5 years at 30ng/4x a day COLD TURKEY. It was making me sick. I figured that out in the Hospital. Medical Science confirmed that next day but I was already to refusing to take it. (Don't you love it when you're right before they are?) When I got home I flushed the bottle of pills that were here and I even remembered the pill I found on the floor and tossed into a basket on my coffee table! You are not supposed to do this. Especially when you have Congestive Heart Failure. It is not good. Your body will do things to you that you can't imagine. It is basically like going blind, having your hearing turned up REALLY LOUD, then there's the bone breaking muscle spasms and the feeling your skin is being scoured off with acid and steel wool. Of course, this will now remove the Elaine's a Drug Addict rationale that Dear Sister Tampa and the Dad of the Year have used to justify NOT HELPING A DISABLED FAMILY MEMBER. What's worse is that I was in the Hospital for several days after refusing the Med so it's been documented - BIG TIME. Just in case they were heading down the, "She says she quit, but...." They are going to come up with some other reason. Think we should do a Poll on it? Suggestions welcome. Also, the cream they used on my Psoriasis in the Hospital has turned parts of my face and legs fiery red. Insult to Injury, there. 9. My Mom is under Hospice Care. We talk everyday and we pray together every night but I have no way to cross the 15 miles to her house. I am not ashamed of being a "Mama's Girl" and I am very afraid, so very afraid that she will die and I won't be able be there or be there to hug her goodbye. If this happens because my Sister and Dad are too bitter, self-absorbed and cruel to come for me. If I don't see my Mom before it happens I am going to lay a Curse on their Names that's going to make the one my Mom put on Don Shula and the Dolphins* look like a County Fair.  So, who said being Disabled means you get to watch TV 24/7 and sleep late? I slept 3 ½ hours last night. As I said above, please read all of this so that I don't have to re-invent the wheel every time someone comes here and wonders where the Hell I've been. I don't mean to be snotty but right now all I can do is concentrate on the above problems and emotions. Then I have to get through the things that my body is doing to me and the only thing that going for me in that Department is the fact that I am probably the MOST RATIONALLY STUBORN person you will ever meet. They wanted to turf me over to Psych so that they could give me Drugs to make it easier on my body because I am running the risk of a CVE or a Heart Attack by abruptly discontinuing the stuff. MORE DRUGS? I don't think so! I told Dr. Hoffman, "I've got Pain Issues- I'm not Crazy! No thanks, but I think I'll ride it out at home." He said it wasn't possible but I haven't had a pill since 4 Dec 03. Guess he was wrong. Imagine my surprise!  Well that's 13 days in the life of Cabin Fever I won't get back. I must admit that the sheer, horrified look of incredulity on people's faces regarding my decision to quit the Morphine is somewhat gratifying. However, since I don't give the ass of a large dock rat about what strangers think about me I'm not getting that much of a happy!  Well mo charas, GOD HOW I HAVE MISSED YOU ALL, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I TREASURE EACH OF YOU!!! DSL should be back on by Thursday so feel free to ISM or AIM or email me if you get a chance between your holiday chores whether it is Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanza or Solstice. My best wishes and hopes for you all! Can't wait to hear from you guys!  Keep the Faith Folks! Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  *My Mom was an Old Baltimore Colt's fan. I mean back in the day that Johnny-U and company were playing. Let's just say that she took umbrage when Shula moved on to 'greener pastures' so she cursed him to NEVER win a Super Bowl with the Dolphins. He had some great teams but... Moral of the story? It is not a good thing to piss an Irish woman off. Irish men know this, now you do too!

      Achairde All!  I have been writing for almost 25 years. Op-Ed's, Guest Columns, Petitions, Letters to Politicians, etc. If you had to ask me what the 3 most important things (to me) I ever wrote I would have to say my Pamphlet on the Use Of Plastic Bullets (or misuse since they were killing and maiming children), my Guest Column in the St. Petersburg Times (complete with specially drawn political cartoon by Oliphant) and this, OD 35: I LOVE YOUR BLOG BUT I'M NOT DYING FOR IT!  I realize that we all joke about how long my articles are but I am going to ask you all to read all of it, send it to others and print it out if you can. The reason is between the paragraphs there are instructions, which could, possibly, SAVE YOUR LIFE, THE LIFE OF YOUR CHILD, A FAMILY MEMBER, LOVED ONE, FRIEND OR EVEN A STRANGER. Feel free to cut and paste to wherever you think it might do the most good, all I ask is Editorial Credit. And if it saves someone's life, SCREW THAT AND GO AHEAD AND TELL PEOPLE YOU WROTE IT. THAT'S HOW SERIOUS IT IS THAT YOU READ EVERY WORD!  PLEASE PEOPLE THIS IS MAY ENABLE YOU TO RESCUE SOMEONE BECAUSE THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. ON BEHALF OF TBIS AND PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY WE ASK ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES OF YOUR TIME, MINUTES WHICH JUST MIGHT SAVE OUR LIVES.  With Gratitude and respect to all!

      Date: 1/3/04 at 4:20PM (1h50m ago)   Mood: TEACHING MODE  Playing: BOB MARLEY: I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW  Achairde All:  I usually don't like to explain the physical mechanics of a seizure or talk about THE other million things wrong with my body. I try to keep them to, "I lost a day or 2", "Having a Bad Brain Day", or commenting that "Multi-tasking is a Personal challenge for me".  As Eddie, who is one of my oldest and dearest friends said in his Christmas email to me, "You always deal with really bad things with laughter and humor." Always have, always will. That being said I am going to talk about what Petit Mal, Complex Partial and Gran Mal seizures are and I'm going to give you first hand testimonials and let you know what Traumatic Brain Injury Survival is like.  There are 2 reasons I am breaking my own rule even though as I say at Tribe.net: "It is also a place where, if I have to kill people I will, we can talk about more than our medications and the next doctors visit." It's to explain why I don't visit longer then to make sure you get a page hit at your site, don't read what you wrote even though you were kind enough to read almost all of what I wrote (LOL Inside Joke On My Long Ass Posts there!) or either I don't write comments, or if I do the spelling and sentence structure sucks because I can't see what I'm typing. It is also because a very dear and much loved and needed friend took something I said about their blog a bit too personally and used the answer "It gives me seizures" as an answer to their latest Poll and was TOTALLY unaware and well meaning but it was none-the-less very painful and demeaning to me and some of my friends who were checking out blogs to see which ones were hard or impossible for us to read without endangering ourselves. Oddly enough I was already planning to do a much less vitriolic post and they were doing research for me. Some of them don't have the same sense of humor I do and got hurt in the process, which is MY BAD and no one else's. So that caveat aside, here goes:  Petit Mal- Looks like you're staring and can last for seconds or minutes. A real bitch if you're watching something live and can't hit rewind or afford TiVo  Complex Partial- Note: I almost hate these worse than the Gran Mals basically because once they found me 3 miles from my home wandering aimlessly, once I got arrested (it was thrown out) and it makes me appear stupid or crazy. The instructions for dealing with a CPS, which is characterized (reads off card in wallet) by- *Be unable to follow instructions *Wander randomly if dazed *Stare and smack my lips *Appear to be conversing with someone not there or is off topic during a conversation with others *Appear Drunk or Intoxicated *Cry, laugh or do strange things Are, If this happens you should- *Guide me if I wander randomly *Do not yell or argue with me because this will cause inappropriate reactions *Make sure that I am in safe surroundings.  Gran Mal- These are SO much fun because they are probably going to kill me. I have been acquaintance raped and had a stranger attempt to rape me because I lose consciousness afterwards. Then there was that amusing time when I was in a busy Mall Food Court and flipped backwards out of my chair, convulsed for several minutes and lost bladder control in front of a couple of hundred people. Did I forget to mention the time I knocked out or broke several teeth on the coffee table while falling and the only reason I didn't die was I landed, fortunately, face down so I didn't drown in my own blood?   And if that's not funny enough let's take the 1 I had the day 2 years ago after I found Dan dead in the shower 4 months before his 30th birthday and for no apparent reason since he was athletic and in good health. I had a Gran Mal, fell face downward, trapped my right arm beneath me for 2 or 3 hours because no one was with me (I'm alone all the time now) and paralyzed my right arm. My hand was clenched in a fist, I trapped all 3 major nerves and had a ton of necrotic tissue (dead) because when I was lying on my arm it was deprived of oxygen so some muscles and other things died. It took 3 Operations (I have an incision that runs from my palm past my elbow, another 1 on the top of my arm that's 5" long and 1 on my forearm that is about 4" long with a big round dip and scar in the middle of it because the drain site from the 1st Operation developed a Staph infection. They had to operate 2 more times to cut out the all infected tissue. I had a year and a half of Physical Therapy and Wound care and while it looks like a real hand most of the paralysis was permanent. Are we having fun yet? During one of these I may (still reading off of card in wallet)- *Fall to the ground (and it ain't the fall that injures or kills you, it's the sudden stop!) *Have muscle jerks and/or convulsions *Cease to breathe *Lose consciousness and be unable to follow instructions *Lose Bladder Control *Lose Bowel Control *Pull at hair or head resulting in injury... There are more but you get the picture. The care instructions are- *Remove objects from my surroundings *Cushion my head *Turn me on my side *Loosen tight neckwear and remove my eyewear *Do not hold me down *Do not put anything in my mouth *Call 911 IF I am injured, pregnant or drowning, my seizure lasts more than five minutes, or if I have two or more seizures back to back (Personal best 11 recorded medically with 2 before the EMS got here and took me to the ER, seizing all the way.)  Most TBI Survivors do not die of old age. We die of heart attacks because uncontrolled Gran Mals (many of us can't take the drugs used by Epileptics because we have seizures due to brain damage and not lesions or chemical imbalances) are really hard on the heart.  My Neurologist says, "It's like taking a hundred aerobics classes all at once." Of the people in my TBI Support Group 4 have died of heart attacks, I spent my 40th Birthday in the ER with congestive heart failure or CHF and a distant cousin of mine died at 35 after 5 Gran Mals and he could take Dilantin and was a marathon runner. They found him 3 days later with the phone on one side and a bottle of Dilantin on the other.  You all are good friends and I could not have gotten the email campaign off the ground without you. You have been there for me when I was upset, hurt or lonely. I do not mean to 'flame' any of you including the Poll person but that last answer on that Poll was, in the words of a song from the 70's, "...one toke over the line, Sweet Jesus!" As I said, I was writing a new blog about some sites being more friendly than others to the Disabled and/or TBIS and I asked some of my friends with either TBI or other disabilities to visit certain sites and rate them. Most could not read them or had to stop looking because they started to feel their seizure triggers kick in.  A couple did have actual seizures.  Usually these sites involve a lot of black and/or high contrast colors and moving objects. I am not asking anyone to change his or her blog. In many cases the artwork and layout are beautiful and very impressive. What I am asking, since page count is so important to some people that they would cheat to increase it, is please understand if I do not visit your blog often, if when I do go there I do not comment or post, I visit to show my appreciation and so you will get the page 'hit'.  Many of people will notice that the first time they came they came to Cabin Fever they received an ISM from me. I try to send them to all newcomers but I started the practice when I was seizing out trying to read my visitors pages and losing hours out of my day. That or waking up on the floor next to the chair at my computer.  Please understand that we know this is our problem and not yours. We've had to cope with things like this every day since we were injured. This is not meant to 'flame' or demean anyone. Also, a real life example will help people to educate people without disabilities or who are not Homebound as to what our lives can be like on a daily basis. That was the reason I started Cabin Fever and isn't that what all of us are trying to do as a team?  Besides, mo charan, I only have 1 good arm left.  Slan leat, My (Damaged Right) Arm to Yours! Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  PS To quote Treebeard the Ent, some things take a long time to say. Especially if they are important!

I myself, celebrate the Celtic New Year, which was back a month or so. I'm not much on the resolutions part because I feel that if something is that important you're going to resolve to do it no matter what day of the year it is. That being said, I do however have wishes.  What I wish for all of you who visit me here, myself and for the world in general is:  No war; plenty of food to eat; clean water to drink; easy births and happy deaths; love that stands the test of time; forgiveness for your errors and the ability to forgive others; work that keeps your hands busy and your heart light; friends that stay in your life even when you're being really stupid; one moment of truly ineffable joy for no reason that you can discern; shared laughter that leaves you with tears in your eyes and aching sides; good health and the means to be treated if that wish fails; that we shut up and actually listen to each other once in a while; that no one should ever feel lonely or forgotten and that when those feelings come there will always be a hand or arms around you to chase it away; no heartache or someone to be there for you if the rains come down too hard; and finally, true happiness in just being who you are and striving a wee bit everyday to see if you can make that person a little kinder, a bit more understanding and a dash more forgiving of yourself if you screw up from time to time as we all do.  That should keep us all busy in 2004.  Dias Muire Duit!  With My Love and Respect to All, I am Elaine- Sometimes known as Cabin Fever

If I forgot anyone let me know! ALSO FEEL FREE TO SEND THEM EVEN IF YOU THINK I GOT THERE FIRST. Remember my Brain Damage? Also, it NEVER HURTS to write some of these people more than once! e/cf  January 7th, 2004  Dear __________:   In November of 2003 Governor Jeb Bush eliminated another 42-million dollars from the Department of Children & Families (AKA DCF) after his plan to manage costs resulted in an increase and not the decrease he claimed his ADA Initiative would provide. Many of the programs eliminated were those that provided assistance to the poor and Disabled or Elderly Homebound a group that is the least able to advocate for themselves. In some cases Florida State Social Workers have advised Homebound clients with relatives elsewhere "…to move because Florida can no longer provide the basic services you need". We do not feel that the task of caring for Florida's citizens is the job for another State or their taxpayers. All attempts to deal with the Governor have been met with lies and evasions. Due to the circumstances an email campaign, "For Those Who Cannot Speak" was begun. The goals of which are as follows:   I The return of the funds and the reinstatement of Homebound Social Workers, Services and Assistance cut or curtailed by the DCF. That a Committee of Florida Legislators, Medical and Social Service Workers and Homebound citizens determines the services most needed by the Clients.  II That the Governors so-called program for the Disabled known as the "Department of Management Services with the State of Florida, The Clearinghouse on Disability Information, The Real Choice Partnership Project (A Grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.) be dissolved and the all funds transferred to the DCF to be used for Client Services.  III That an Independent Agency is appointed to investigate the use or possible misuse of funding provided by the Federal Government as part of the grant obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And to investigate the termination of Florida State Benefits to those who have protested the cuts to the Press and Legislators.  IV That the State of Florida adopt a system similar to that of the Social Security Administration (SSA). Once qualified a Permanently Disabled or Elderly Homebound client would not be forced to submit the same information year after year. Instead they would be monitored through the use of information already provided by the SSA. The DCF would then conduct random auditing and require the Client or Duly Appointed Caregivers to report all changes in income, health or residence, etc. with the understanding that failure to comply will result in the suspension or termination of services. This change will result in a more fiscally responsible use of the taxpayer’s dollars. It will also free State Social Workers to handle reasonable caseloads and provide vital monitoring of the Children of Florida.  To this end each individual supporting the FTWCS Campaign will send an email to Governor Jeb Bush. Those residing in the State of Florida will copy their email to President George Walker Bush. Those residing in other states will also copy the Governor of his or her State. Those who are not American Citizens will write directly to the President with a copy to Governor Bush.  In order to honor the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. an Advocate of Peaceful Social Action and who died for his Principles all emails will be sent on January 19th of 2004.  Your endorsement and your involvement in this effort would greatly benefit the Disabled or Elderly Homebound of Florida. Further information, including links to Jeb Bush, George Walker Bush and a listing of Governors of each State may be found at the following website: www.cabinfever.modblog.com.  Thank you for your attention to this matter, I hope that you will join us, along with several Universities, the Knights of Columbus and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, to name a few, in our effort to support some of the most vulnerable of Florida Citizens.

      Mood: DETERMINED  Playing: THAT PETROL EMOTION: BIG DECISION  RE: 'FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SPEAK EMAIL CAMPAIGN'  Dear Friends and Visitors:  It has been brought to my attention that some Americans feel that our email campaign is too bothersome because, "It is a waste of time and won't do any good anyway." (Words I have seen in more emails and ISMs than I care to mention.) The reason a person like you think Social Action is fruitless is because you are a part of the problem. As long as you do nothing, Politicians will get away with cutting Social Services to build a new stadium in their District CEO's and Big Corporations will continue to pollute and steal from their employees and shareholders. The Civil Rights movement started in a small church with a few people brave enough to say NO MORE and with the conviction to DO SOMETHING more than just talk about it.  For that reason, the day to email Jeb Bush with cc:'s to President Bush and the Governor of your state will be on January 19th to honor Dr. Martin Luther King. He paid with his life to make things better for others. All I and all the other people who are helping to coordinate this action (Qwerty, mindcandy and billysblog, Phil, and Jennifer to name just a few) ask from you is ONE email.  To those of you who do not live in the US the "I don't live there so it's not my fight" or your personal feelings about the American Government do not excuse you. The vital point is that this is NOT a Government Issue it IS a Human Rights Issue. I have been a member of Amnesty for many years and have sent thousands of letters to support Prisoners of Conscience in many countries. When I write an ActionGram I do not ask the geographical or economic status of the country paying the torturer. I do worry about the person being tortured living to be released.   If you have read the International Charter on Human Rights you will know that withholding food or medication deliberately is a Human Rights Violation. I can assure you that the 72 year old woman who is afraid to shower alone because she might fall or the 24 year old in the wheelchair do not have the time to worry about US Foreign Affairs. They are too busy staying alive and to find someone to take them to the doctors, help them get groceries or have a prescription picked up from the Pharmacy.  What we asked from everyone- Floridians, Americans, and those who reside outside our borders was to either write or cut/paste the one I wrote. To send 1 email to Florida Governor Jeb Bush and to cc: President Bush, your Governor if you live in the US, or the US Ambassador to your county. We also asked that you ask 5 friends that have Internet Access as well to do the same. We are willing to spare you the effort of locating the proper email addresses or websites if you are pressed for time.  The next letter I write because a Political Prisoner is being held is jailed and is beaten and/or raped on a daily basis I will be thinking of you. Be apolitical if you want to be or be anti-American if that's your thing. But know that America, your country or the entire world will never get any better if we do not stand up for ALL of the citizens of this fragile planet. Someday, I pray that those who care will outnumber those who are apathetic or have a political ax to grind!  For those who do care, we make our stand on January 29th and in the spirit of Dr. King.  Sincerely, Elaine M. Hinchey AKA Cabin Fever Tampa, Florida  PS I chose That Petrol Emotion song for the line, "Take the time to live, take the time to give we've got to Agitate! Educate! And Organize!" I pray that everyone will think about it. e/cf

      Mood: UBER DETERMINED!  Playing: JEWEL: HANDS  Achairde All:  Well, I didn't know it but apparently we are officially an Historic Event. The first all Internet Human Rights Campaign! No home office, no snail mail and the Exec's all live in either different states or different countries! Take a bow folks!  Well we’re down to the wire and naturally my computer GOT HACKED!!! Whenever I go into a program and start typing the minute I start typing it SHUTS THE PROGAM I’M IN DOWN. No, do you want to exit the program; No do you want to save before you quit. JUST GONE! Interestingly enough I can cut and paste to my hearts content. Send and receive emails, as long as I don’t type!   I don’t have the time to reformat my hard drive and restore all my programs before we finish the “FTWCS” so I’m going to need everyone here on ModBlog to tell people where the emails are and that we ALL are mailing them on January 19th. That or someone needs to email me and tell me how to fix that long file name in DOS.  So, here’s the last of the info I have before we email. First, you DO NOT have to use the one’s that I wrote for Florida, U.S. or International. I just did them as a guideline. Second, remember they have to go out the day of the 19th so that we can show our respect for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. If you live outside of the U.S. that is the Federal Holiday to commemorate his life. We are celebrating his sacrifice for Non-Violent Social Protests or Actions with an Action of our own.  The addresses for George and Jeb are as follows- George Bush is: president@whitehouse.gov and the address for Jeb Bush is: jeb.bush@myflorida.com. For those of you copying your Governor there is a link on the right that takes you to an index where you can go directly to your Governor. A lot of them have ‘leave your email here’ pages so I would suggest that you copy the text and paste it in there and the send Jeb and George’s by your usual email. If I can’t fix the problem with my PC by then I will email by cut and paste myself.  I want to thank all of you here at ModBlog and from other places for the support, time and effort you have all put into this Protest. Special thanks to Co-Captain Q or My Q as I call him (you know him as Qwerty) because if James Bond had my Q he would have got more done and been a whole lot cooler. To mindcandy who is almost as nasty as I am about the government neglecting the Disabled and has worked on through his own pain and disability and alerted his students so that they can participate. To Susan for help in planing and for distributing Flyers at the University of South Florida and to Bill for the laughter and support along with a truly epic one liner. To everyone who has left a message promising they’d send an email, ask 5 friends to email (who would then ask 5 friends…Geometric Progression is a Politicians worst nightmare!) you are ALL GREATLY APPRECIATED!   Thanks also to (and these are in no special order AND if I forgot anyone it’s my bad and I apologize!): the American Indian Movement (US); Knights of Columbus; the NAACP both in Florida and National; Students and Faculty of the University of South Florida; Amnesty USA; The Ancient Order of Hibernians; to Father Robert Morris of St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church and to Sister Nancy and all the Parishioners; Self-Reliance in Tampa; the Students and Faculty of the University of Wisconsin; Sinn Fein USA; the Florida Independent Living Council; to Phil Mulrenin (AOH/KOC) for his effort, love and prayers; the Doctors and Staff of the Hillsborough County Family Care Center (with special THANKS to Dr. Cheryl Reed, MD for keeping me alive); the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay; all the Politicians and their Staff who came through for us and down on the side of the Homebound and are sending emails we know who you are and WE WILL SPREAD THE WORD WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR YOUR NEXT ELECTION! Those few who ‘weaseled out’ on the Disabled or Elderly Homebound TRUST ME WHEN I SAY YOUR OPPONENT IN YOUR NEXT ELECTION WILL KNOW HOW YOU FAILED YOUR CONSTITUENTS! To Mayor Williams of Washington D.C. who said, “You can come home, again” thank you and your Staff for all the help and support.   And to the thousands of other people in Florida, other States or Territories and Other Countries please accept my gratitude and thanks on behalf of the Disabled or Elderly Homebound of Florida. You are, quite literally, lifesavers!  As always, thanks to Mo Clannad agus Charan, friends and family both Hinchey and Maier.   And for Daniel, always mo cariad.  My Arm to Yours! Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  PS Cooper chara, any chance you and iMike could run that Flyer I sent you guys? It would help to spread the word. I know my column isn't the most techno thing in the world so if you can’t I’ll deal. Thanks! E/CF  PPS Before you all ask: Yes, I have a Firewall; Yes, I have Virus Scanned; Yes, I have run Norton’s WinDoctor; Yes, I have restored the Registry to a previous date; Yes, I have run the System Scan and everything comes back OK EXCEPT AS OF JANUARY 6TH I have a Binary Code or File Name that is too long. How I got it I don’t know because I haven’t added any new Software or Hardware and I Virus Scan my emails. And I don’t know in the Name of DOS how to edit it to a shorter length, I don’t know if I should delete it. Or even if it would fix it. EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS INCLUDING TYPING MY PASSWORD IN TO START WINDOWS IT JUST WIGS OUT AFTER THAT. I THINK SOMEONE DOESN’T WANT ME TO WRITE ANYMORE OR AM I JUST PARANOID? If you know how to fix it PLEASE email me the information or I will call you on my dime if you need to walk me through it. This is an Assisted Living Device and I can’t pay my bills without it. Let's hope the Electric Company is in a good mood! ;-) e/cf

Playing: LZ: NO QUARTER (LONG VERSION)  January 19th, 2004 Your Town, Your State   To: Governor Jeb Bush  CC: President George Walker Bush  Subject: “For Those Who Cannot Speak” Email Action  Dear Governor Bush:  I am writing you today in the behalf of the above campaign and because, I as a Floridian, am ashamed of you and the image your Office has given America of our State. Due to either your actions or inaction these people along with countless others living in Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand now have the idea that we care more about Sports Stadiums than we do the Disabled or Elderly. Especially disturbing is that those who were hurt most by your budget cuts have the additional misfortune to be Homebound. I ask, Sir, on their behalf that you take action on the following items:  I You return the 42-million to the Department of Children & Families Budget. That you re-institute Homebound assistance, transportation and medical attention now. II Dissolve your so-called ADA Initiative and return the money, along with the Federal Grant Money you received for it over to the Department of Children & Families. III That an Independent Agency investigate the possible misuse of the Federal Grant Money along with the termination of benefits to those who have written about, protested or gone to their Legislators. IV That, in order to use tax dollars in a fiscally responsible manner as well as to assign Caseworkers a reasonable work load, The State of Florida adopt a system similar to that of the Social Security Administration. Once a Disabled citizen is qualified they should be monitored and they or their Caregiver be required to provide all changes in their situation to the DCF or risk the suspension or loss of Benefits. Requiring the same information year after year is a waste of our Taxes and would allow Social Workers more time on new Clients and finding Children who have been lost or have fallen through the ‘cracks in the System’  I do not blame the caring DCF worker’s who are honest enough to tell the Disabled or Elderly Homebound, “If you have relatives in another state the best thing I can tell you is to move. Florida no longer has the money to provide you with the Basic Services you need.” I resent that you have put them in that position to begin with.  I resent that even after you were advised by telephone calls, emails and letters that people were leaving our State just to obtain the bare necessities of life you did nothing. Apparently you are quite comfortable to have the taxpayers and Social Service agencies of other States take care of your problem for you. Even though it will eventually lead to those Governors cutting services to their citizens because of the additional Clients you are sending them. Perhaps Florida should learn from California’s example because if we did I would be working on a Recall Petition along with sending you this email.   When elected you said that you read your own email. For all our sakes and “For Those Who Cannot Speak” I hope that was not another empty Campaign Promise.  In remembrance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. whose life was, and continues to be, an inspiration to all who believe that change can come from Non-Violent Protest please show your respect as well. Return the funds to the Budget, restore the DCF Homebound Services and quit expecting other States to solve our problem for you. The Initiative you promised would save money has actually increased costs to the point where you have had to make Draconian cuts at the expense of the people least able to advocate for themselves. It’s time to admit your failure and correct your mistake.  Sincerely, Your Signature Your Name

PRESS LETTER:  January 12th, 2004 Tampa, Florida US  To The Distinguished Members of the Press:  Attached you will find today's Press Release describing the culmination of our campaign on January 19th, or, Dr. Martin Luther King Junior Day. Even though this is a Federal Holiday it was it picked by two thirds of the Executive Committee as the best day for this type of action. It is a peaceful electronic protest using many of the principles Dr. King sacrificed his life for. The age range of "For Those Who Cannot Speak" is from 13 to 72, we have all the colors of the American Rainbow and we stretch across state lines and International Borders. People without Disabilities or who are not the Caregiver of a Disabled or Elderly Homebound person still make up over 60% of our membership. This is not a Disability or Racial or Political Issue it is a Human Rights Issue.  Below you will find the text of the January 7th emails we began sending to our friends, family and our Elected Officials (I know that all of the names under CC: section of this email received it!) to explain the severity of the situation. Many of our Legislative Representatives support the Right of a Homebound person to food, medications, in home assistance with minor tasks and medical attention. A few have been somewhat apathetic, one or two openly antagonistic, but that information will be available to all of you and our members after January 19th. (And the people who will be running against them for their next term!) I hope that you forgive me for not writing you individually but the last time I ran a Human Rights Campaign this large I was 13 years younger. Also, no drunk driver had, as yet, made that attempt to get from Point A to Point B through my Brain! While I feel terribly rude one of our younger organizers suggested, "You need to quit living in the real world and try living in the virtual world instead."   Unless they restore Social Services, Homebound Social Workers and Medical transportation I fear that I, along with many Floridians, will find it hard to live in either world.  Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.  Sincerely, Elaine Elaine M.

(I'LL EXPLAIN LATER)  January 19th, 2004 Voted As the Day to Send All eMAILS. This date was chosen, despite it being a Federal Holiday, to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In addition, as a means of celebrating his sacrifice in the cause of Non-Violent Social Protests.   Tampa, Florida, January 12th, 2004: The “For Those Who Cannot Speak” International Internet Coalition, an Online Group devoted to Advocating for the Rights of the Disabled or Elderly Homebound, has chosen January 19th as the day for all members, friends and supporters to send their emails. This Action is in response to the cuts in the Department of Children & Families budget in November of 2003. Those most effected by the cuts are the Disabled or Elderly Homebound, people who are the least likely to be able to advocate for themselves. It also addresses the Issue of telling those who need Homebound Services to move if they have relatives in another State. This is due to various Florida Social Workers advising, “Florida can no longer provide basic services to these Clients.” Despite our attempts to discuss the matter with Governor Bush we have been fed misinformation or simply ignored. Therefore, on January 19th Floridians and those in other countries will email Jeb Bush and President George Walker Bush. Those who reside in other U.S. States will also copy their own Governors to protest Jeb Bush’s attempt to use their tax-dollars and Social Services.    We also demand that the Governors so-called ADA Initiative be dissolved and State Funds be returned to the DCF Budget. We demand that Federal Grant Money be audited and then turned over to the DCF.   That Florida adopt a system similar to Social Security Disability, where once qualified a Client be monitored instead of sending the same information EVERY year. This will improve services and cut costs.  LETTER TEXT: INSERT OD 37 LETTER  which, I devoutly hope that you copied, emailed and stuck up on on office/school/campus or where ever you do 3/4 of you life. Unless I can find someone to put it into code, email will have to do. And have a little fun with your calculater. You ask 5 friends who each ask 5 friends who ask 5 of their friends and all from you sending them an email or calling them on their cell phone. Add the number you came up with a multiply that with the people who come here- THAT'S ONE FRICKIN LARGE NUMBER MR. BIGGLESWORTH! LOL e/cf

      Mood: IT'S ALLLLIIVVVEE!  Playing: CLASH (THE): KNOW YOUR RIGHTS  Hey people, I am alive!  I know that I haven't written this week but I'm still fielding questions from the press, various elected types and people and/or organizations asking me, "How the Hell did you do it? And can you give us some help."  The first thing I tell them is that there is no I. You aren't going to pull this off without a lot of help and a place like ModBlog where people actually care about each other. Even then, if you don't get good people to turn out the emailers, raise your page hits and give you good advice it's not going to fly. I had My Q and MindCandy doing the latter plus keeping me from boarding the next Greyhound out of here. All of which we still need desperately.  Also, just because we sent the emails doesn't mean we let up. The Second Wave, which will start next Monday, is emailing Jeb & Co. and saying thanks for the auto-reply BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT? YOU KEEP SENDING THAT EMAIL UNTIL YOU GET AN ANSWER!  Here's a copy of letter I sent to someone in another state who is facing the same problem we have here in Florida. Pass it around. Take it to your Poli Sci Department, human rights organization or your Political Food Chain. Let them know that we know how to deal with them now, we are not going to 'just go away' and from here on Politicians in every country should keep one eye on the Net. Because we will be there. If they need an example remind them that Russia avoided a coup d'etat by old-line Communists by virtue of the Internet and Cell Phones. Remind them that on 9/11, over a Cell Phone on a plane in Pennsylvania the last words the Emergency Dispatcher heard were, "Let's rock and roll people!"  So, what are you waiting for?  Slan leat, Elaine  AKA Cabin Fever   Achairde (Name of Person or Organization),  I appreciated your writing me. I always try to keep some levity in my life and writings because Brain Damage and Plastic Bullets are so damn NOT funny. If I stop laughing I'll start crying and I don't know if I could stop. (That was not levity.)  I had heard about (the state in question). Personally I have found, over the years, that there is always money but you have to do some pretty distasteful things to find it. Me, I ACTUALLY READ THE ENTIRE STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGET EACH NEW FISCAL YEAR. HELL, I EVEN READ EVERY GRANT PROPOSAL THAT GETS MORE THAN 10 MILLION DOLLARS. That way when I approach the appropriate elected official I can say, "You're telling me that that you're sorry, that you support medical care for the poor, the elderly and the disabled but there's just NO money. Well (Insert name here) what if we take the 11-million grant given to University B and put it back in the Department of Children and Families since it is only duplicating a study done by University A last year. Now since I need 42-million that would bring us down to 31-million and I have a few more ideas where we can find that." I have actually heard Politicians groan out loud at this point before they ask me, "Did you read the ENTIRE budget?" My reply is always, "Well NOT all of it just the grant proposals over 10-million and, of course, the Budget itself." (More groaning.) One U.S. Senator actually said to me years ago, "You just are not going to go away are you Ms. Hinchey?" My reply, "No Sir, I really won't."  I've had a few inquiries from other organizations since; the FTWCS Campaign was, according to reporters the very first all Internet Social Action. No home office, no dues, and the people most involved lived in 3 different countries and 4 different states and that doesn't include the thousands of emails sent from all over the U.S. and Internationally. You need a Home like ModBlog where people actually care about each other. You desperately need organizers who know how to get those emailers going, raising your page hits and giving you good advice. Even if it's not something you want to hear. I had people using the names My Q and mindcandy who did those superbly and without pay. None of us were paid. We did it because it needed to be done. If someone in (Insert State or Organization) wants the information than they can write me at my email address cabin_fever90@earthlink.net or at Cabin Fever, which is located at http://www.cabinfever.modblog.com. I will be happy to help.  Keep the faith chara and thanks again for writing!  Slan, Elaine M. Hinchey AKA Cabin Fever

      As in...IT'S HERE!!! Did you send your email yet?   Whoa, long time comin' wasn't it folks! At least it seemed that way to me. I've spent the last week eating, sleeping, talking to reporters and supporters, seizing and writing in this damn chair and in front of this computer. I'm tired, I'm happy, in a wee bit of pain and the Beaureguard (the world's only known to Medical Science 'Seizure Cat' SB!) keeps looking at me as if I need a bath even though I took one yesterday...or the day before that, I think. Who cares, soon it'll be just me, my shower chair and a generous dollop of Lavender & Jasmine Aromatherapy! LOL  I'll show you mine, if you'll show me yours- email that is. And for the last time MC & Billy- Up On The Curb! (and out of the damn gutter for those of you who didn't understand that comment.)  Thanks to Everyone! My Arm to Yours! Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  PS Here's mine:  From: "Elaine M. Hinchey"   To: "Jeb Bush"   Cc: "George Walker Bush"   Subject: "For Those Who Cannot Speak" Email Action Date: Monday, January 19, 2004 1:14 AM  January 19th, 2004  Tampa, Florida US   Dear Governor Bush:  I am writing you today in the behalf of the above campaign and because, I as a Floridian, am ashamed of you and the image your Office has given America of our State. Due to either your actions or inaction these people along with countless others living in Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand now have the idea that we care more about Sports Stadiums than we do the Disabled or Elderly. Especially disturbing is that those who were hurt most by your budget cuts have the additional misfortune to be Homebound. I ask, Sir, on their behalf that you take action on the following items:  I You return the 42-million to the Department of Children & Families Budget. That you re-institute Homebound assistance, transportation and medical attention now.  II Dissolve your so-called ADA Initiative and return the money, along with the Federal Grant Money you received for it over to the Department of Children & Families.  III That an Independent Agency investigate the possible misuse of the Federal Grant Money along with the termination of benefits to those who have written about, protested or gone to their Legislators.  IV That, in order to use tax dollars in a fiscally responsible manner as well as to assign Caseworkers a reasonable work load, The State of Florida adopt a system similar to that of the Social Security Administration. Once a Disabled citizen is qualified they should be monitored and they or their Caregiver be required to provide all changes in their situation to the DCF or risk the suspension or loss of Benefits. Requiring the same information year after year is a waste of our Taxes and would allow Social Workers more time on new Clients and finding Children who have been lost or have fallen through the 'cracks in the System'  I do not blame the caring DCF worker's who are honest enough to tell the Disabled or Elderly Homebound, "If you have relatives in another state the best thing I can tell you is to move. Florida no longer has the money to provide you with the Basic Services you need." I resent that you have put them in that position to begin with.  I resent that even after you were advised by telephone calls, emails and letters that people were leaving our State just to obtain the bare necessities of life you did nothing. Apparently you are quite comfortable to have the taxpayers and Social Service agencies of other States take care of your problem for you. Even though it will eventually lead to those Governors cutting services to their citizens because of the additional Clients you are sending them. Perhaps Florida should learn from California's example because if we did I would be working on a Recall Petition along with sending you this email.   When elected you said that you read your own email. For all our sakes and "For Those Who Cannot Speak" I hope that was not another empty Campaign Promise.  In remembrance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. whose life was, and continues to be, an inspiration to all who believe that change can come from Non-Violent Protest please show your respect as well. Return the funds to the Budget, restore the DCF Homebound Services and quit expecting other States to solve our problem for you. The Initiative you promised would save money has actually increased costs to the point where you have had to make Draconian cuts at the expense of the people least able to advocate for themselves. It's time to admit your failure and correct your mistake.  Sincerely, Elaine M. Hinchey Citizen of Florida & Campaign Director "FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SPEAK" Email Campaign

       Mood: TIRED, IN AGONY & HOPEFUL  Playing: THE EAGLES: DESPERADO  Achairde All:  Well folks, it's a wrap. Tomorrow is THE DAY and thanks to the hard work of so many people (My Q, mindcandy and so many others at ModBlog, Tribe and in the 'real' world) we made it. (Crossing fingers. I FERVENTLY HOPE!)  I'm working on 2 seizures and 90 minutes of sleep so I'll be brief, for a change. Here is the last thing (before my email, of course!) I wrote. I hope it expresses how blessed I feel to know you all.  It was great making Internet History with you!  My Arm to Yours- Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  OP Ed:  On October 16th of 2003 a physician and a social worker told me that I needed to move out of the state of Florida because I am Disabled and virtually Homebound. Apparently they were advising this course of action to anyone who had relatives out of state. I was born in Washington, D.C. and I have a sister who is an attorney there so their solution was for me to return to D.C. after being in Florida for the last 20 plus years. Their exact words were, "We’ve had to advise most of our Homebound clients with relatives elsewhere to move because Florida can no longer provide the basic services you people need. They’ve all been cut from the budget". Although I did not consider this a viable option I did contact Mayor Williams and he disproved the old adage, "you can't go home again" by welcoming me with open arms. In two weeks I had more correspondence with the Mayor, Brenda C. Perkins and Elizabeth B. Parker of The District's Department of Human Services than I had with their counterparts in Florida in four months. I am 44 and I became Disabled after a drunk driver decided in December of 1990 that the shortest distance between two points was my brain. It wasn’t. I am also, as someone who has known me for 30 years said, "Arguably, the worst person in the entire State of Florida they could have told that to!"   He said that because he knew that I had been an Insurance Agent who left to go back to college and become a Teacher. Usually it happens the other way around because Insurance is much more lucrative. However, my family has this silly notion of social service so we have a lot of Cops, Firemen, Teachers and Medical Professionals at our reunions. In addition to my desire to teach High School English and History I was also was a Human Rights writer and activist. I was just starting to show up locally when the accident happened. Guest columns in newspapers, Protests, television and radio appearances, etc. I worked the passage of the Mac Bride Principles here in Florida so quite a few Politicians knew me. A couple of the pamphlets I had written were being used Nationally and Internationally so I was looking forward to a long career as a writer and educator. That part of my life was over, or so I thought, when I had to learn to read again.   However, I had recently begun an Online Column or ‘blog’ entitled Cabin Fever. I wanted to give people without Disabilities a real time look (sorry, no webcam) into the life of someone, who was, for all intents and purposes, Homebound. I also wanted to give people with Disabilities and their Care Givers someplace to go for links to various Agencies since over the last 10 years I have become a ‘Stop on the Underground Disability Railroad’. And, most importantly, I wanted my dignity back. Being Disabled and unable to be Re-hab’d back into Society means giving up your Right to Privacy and your Humanity.   On October 17th I gathered up the courage to telephone Governor Jeb Bush’s Press Office for a quote in response to what I had been told. First there was Alia Faraj, his Press Secretary. She had John Kuczwanski of the Department of Management of Services call me and he passed me on to Julie Shaw. Ms. Shaw is the Executive Director of the Governors Working Group on the ADA (which is part of an unlikely Agency with the cumbersome name of, "Department of Management Services with the State of Florida, The Clearinghouse on Disability Information, The Real Choice Partnership Project (A Grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.) This was the Governor’s answer to cutting costs and improving services, which resulted in higher costs and a draconian termination of services as well as a 42 million-dollar budget cut from the Department of Children & Families. When I remarked that any Agency that closed its office in Tallahassee for nine days to do a seminar in Orlando was a Trophy Program. Or that closing a government office to do a seminar was akin to Jeb Bush shutting the State Capitol down while he spoke to a Kiwanis Club Dinner in Miami they stopped returning my calls.   That’s when I really discovered the power of the Internet and the compassion of the people who use it. Not everything is e-business, chat rooms and video games. There are caring people out there. So, I borrowed a page from my old playbook and we started an email campaign with four demands. We being me and 29,065 of my closest ‘network friends’ on my two websites. We’re using the ‘you email and ask 5 friends to do it as well’ method. Then they ask 5 friends because Geometric Progression is a Politician’s worst nightmare. We also activated every Politician in our Legislative ‘Food Chain’ and suggested that along with Jeb we copy the President and for those out of state participants they copy their Governors as well. We thought it only fair since Jeb Bush is asking them to use their constituents tax dollars to pay for his mistakes. International participants were urged to copy their own President or Prime Minister.   Our demands are quite basic. That he return the money he cut from the DCF. Close his ADA Initiative and turn the money from that, along with the Federal Grant money, over to the DCF. An Audit of where those Grant dollars were spent. And to save taxpayers money and give Caseworker’s a reasonable caseload they stop reinventing the wheel every year and follow the Social Security guidelines for the Permanently Disabled. We are not asking for something unreasonable, such as a Lunar Colony or something really frivolous. Most of us just want to be able to get to the Doctor’s Office, pick ups for our prescriptions and groceries, or take a shower without having to take our lives in our hands and do it while we’re alone.   Friday a Reporter told me that we are the first all Internet Human Rights Campaign. (Actually we did use the telephone as well.) No home office, no snail mail and the various Directors live in 4 different states and 3 different countries. We call it the "For Those Who Cannot Speak" Email Campaign since Jeb Bush’s cuts targeted those least likely to advocate for themselves and we will all be emailing him and the others on January 19th. We realize that Government offices will be closed on that day but the Executive Committee felt it would be a fitting way to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We are honoring his sacrifices for the cause of Non-Violent Protests with a Non-Violent Protest of our own.   Along the way we have managed to pick up some fellow travelers such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians, The NAACP USA & Florida, the Knights of Columbus and several Universities and more Politicians and Groups than Op-Ed rules allow me to list. They know who they are and they know they are appreciated. During his campaign Jeb Bush claimed he read his own email. If that is true and not another empty promise he’s going to need a few days of quiet time. I started this because I have a rule that I follow religiously- if I can obtain a Service or Assistance simply because my background and education have taught me where to go and what to write then everyone who can’t do it will get the information from me. This is to pay back all the help given to me on this campaign and over the years. I believe everything happens for a reason. I didn’t Advocate for the Disabled until I became one of them. In other words, my accident was no ‘accident’. It is also the reason I get out of bed every morning. Everyone has a job to do and this, even though it doesn’t pay me or come with benefits and a 401K plan, is mine.   The Scales are still tipped in favor of those who have helped me because, in the midst of all the writing, organizing and daily seizures, I finally got my dignity back.   E.M.C. Hinchey  Elaine M.

       Mood: SAD  Playing: 3 DOORS DOWN: DUCK AND RUN  As I told you, Domestic Violence and the Disabled is not something that you can cover in one article. I don't mean to seem harsh to the people who work for Domestic Violence Hotlines or Organizations but somewhere, along the line, they forgot about Abused & Disabled Spouses. They also forgot that some Abuse Victims have Disabled or Special Needs Children and no one ever planned a safety net for either of us. Only 4 states have laws requiring assistance be given to what is the most vulnerable victims of Domestic Violence. Before I get to my story let me give you a bit of background on the situation. To my knowledge there are few reports on the subject- at best we are appended to a study helping 'Normal' Spouses. The most in depth of all the studies and reports on the subject was Federal Grant Project and the reason I know it is because I was PATIENT X. That was several years ago and I have contacted the following people or organizations and couldn't give me anything more recent than 1998.  Contacted: National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, National Electronic Network on Violence Against Women, Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, The Spring, HELPU Fire & Life Safety At-Risk Populations and First Responders: At-risk Safety Training Project, George Anderson of the Domestic Violence Batterers Intervention Vacillator Training (he being THE George Anderson of the Anderson & Anderson Domestic Violence Curriculum. This curriculum is currently in use throughout the United States, Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Russia, Korea, Mexico and Chile!), the Seattle University School of Law's Hague Convention Project (which collects information on international domestic violence and on parental child abduction cases involving domestic violence and the Hague Convention), The National Resource Center on Domestic Violence, Domestic Violence Awareness Month (DVAM evolved from the first Day of Unity observed in October, 1981 by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV). The UC Davis Heath Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Violence Against Women (or VAW), and The Internal Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICAD).   This is what the 'Experts' have to say on the subject:  Excerpt From: The Prevalence of Abuse among Women with Disabilities:  Interventions for Abused Women with Disabilities:  There have been no studies that examine the existence, feasibility, or effectiveness of abuse interventions for women with disabilities. Women with disabilities face serious barriers to accessing existing programs to help women remove violence from their lives. In both the disability rights movement and the battered women's movement, it is generally acknowledged that programs to assist abused women are often architecturally inaccessible, lack interpreter services for deaf women, and are unable to assist women who need assistance with daily self care or medications.   In addition to the types of abuse experienced by all women, women with physical disabilities are sometimes abused by withholding needed orthotic equipment (wheelchairs, braces), medications, transportation, or essential assistance with personal tasks, such as dressing or getting out of bed.   Excerpt From: Paper on Physical and Sexual Abuse of The Disabled:  Physical and sexual abuse can happen to anyone, including people with disabilities. Disabled individuals may even be at a higher risk for abuse than others simply because they may not have the physical ability for self-defense. However, it is generally non-disabled persons who report the majority of abuse cases. There are many reasons why an individual with a disability who is being abused might not report their case including the fact that the abuser may be the person that the disabled individual depends on for their care. Types of abuse include assault, neglect spousal abuse, sexual assault, and other forms of violence.   Excerpt from: The Domestic Violence & The Disabled:  But leaving is seldom if ever something a woman or a disabled person can do. There are few if any shelters which can help the disabled. Most shelters are already full. There is little funding to support the disabled victim of domestic violence or to help him or her find a safe haven, a shelter, a new apartment. According to the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearings of 1990, there are three times as many animal shelters in the U.S. as there are shelters for battered women.   When I called the local Woman's Shelter I was told that they could not help me. The reason was that they "...had no facilities to deal with your medications, seizures or personal care." I could not stay with them. In other words, "There was no room at the Inn."  Tomorrow: Running the Gauntlet in a Wheelchair.  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever

      Mood: REVENGE  Playing: RAMMSTEIN: DU HAST  AN APOLOGY TO MY FRIENDS & READERS: I had intended to publish Part Two of my series on Domestic Violence & Disabilities today. However, as I writer and an advocate I felt I needed to take time out to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Many of my colleagues are concerned as well. We are all feeling the chill wind of censorship down our backs. Part Two will be available tomorrow. E/CF  To: Editor, Washington Post Re: "Don't Tolerate Indecency" By: Jill E. Summerhays  Utah Chapter Director  Parents Television Council  Sandy, Utah  Apparently I am, along with a few Australian Bushmen, one of the few people who did not see Ms. Jackson's breast during the Super Bowl Half-Time Show on CBS. Moments before I had switched to another channel because I am not a fan and I found the Jackson/Timberlake sex act simulation to be both embarrassing and boring. Not that I was embarrassed for myself. I was embarrassed that MTV was staging, in a desperate attempt to shore up it's flagging ratings, what was obviously a Publicity Stunt. Even before Janet & Justin I had left because I find the lyrics to Kid Rock's "I'm A Cowboy" degrading. I had just returned only to see the pair bumping and grinding across the stage. I remarked to someone, "That woman has more plastic than a Tupperware Party!" and changed the channel again. While the rest of the world was getting a 'free shot' I was ranting about the entire show being on in the first place! I felt that MTV was a poor choice because in our pluralistic society, the Super Bowl is the closest thing we have to a truly American Celebration. Every other Holiday we have has it's detractors or people who celebrate a different Cultural or Religious Tradition.   I was also angry because as a writer I have always been against Censorship. I have written about Human Rights for over 20 years and published things about Political Torture of Dissidents, Forcible Strip Searches and Plastic Bullets that were critical of the many governments- including that of the United States. Things that in other countries would have had me arrested, forced into hiding or placed my own family in the very danger of becoming victims of what I was exposing. My refuge, along with many of my 'fellow travelers' has always been, "That's why there's an On/Off button and a Channel Changer on your remote. If you don't like it- don't watch it!" What MTV did on Super Bowl Sunday has implications that go far beyond seeing part of someone's surgically enhanced breast. It gives Censorship Advocates in this country some pretty damning evidence in support of their Cause. That frightens me. It should frighten all those who support Free Speech. Unfortunately, the critics are too busy focusing on the act and it's producer without realizing that every time they mention MTV they've just given them a bit more Free Advertising. In other words, it's MTV 7 and the U.S. Constitution 0 at the half!  I have no doubt that neither CBS or the NFL would have permitted such an act if they had known what was planned. They both realize that their revenues come from having a family-friendly product. Enlightened self-interested would have prevented it. However, MTV is facing serious competition for those all-important 18-35 viewers. The hue and cry they raised has served to attract those who had grown bored with their trite, 'no matter who's singing it all sounds the same to us' Format. The viewers are back and hanging onto every Update on the 'scandal'. The real issue here is an angle outraged parents and critics are overlooking, the one where more viewers will turn to cable or satellite stations during the crackdown on Free Television. There could come a time when Freedom of Speech is only available to those who can afford it! That should be the real focus of any investigation. Any investigation should also include the Securities & Exchange Commission because investors in MTV sold the Bill of Rights out for the proverbial 'thirty pieces of silver'.  Already other 'live broadcasts' are announcing tape delays to prevent such a thing from happening on their Watch. What could be a means of editing out nudity or outrageous acts could so very easily become editing out what people say because the censor has different political views. Well-meaning supporters are standing in line at the door waiting to invite Big Brother and every Political Action Committee to come in and save us from the wonders of plastic surgery. The only way we have of preventing that is to hit MTV where it will really hurt- in the pocket book. The FCC should suspend their right to broadcast for 30 days. It was a commercial act and should have commercial repercussions. No debate.  If this seems harsh to you please consider that what they did was to invite the Special Interests to put fetters on every writer, director and performer in America. The people of MTV made McCarthy'ing the airwaves seem like a good idea. I doubt that even ACLU could defend it's actions. Not at the expense of our rights as a nation to write or produce a program without having someone's finger on the button ready to edit out our very thoughts and actions. Those who are pro-censorship should take comfort in the fact that those you want to protect already find MTV to be boring. Not even Madonna and Brittany could drum up enough business to keep the investors happy. While trying to shock and entertain their viewers all they have done is to have rendered them indifferent and shockproof. Your children 'vote with their wallets' and MTV's actions during the Super Bowl only prove that they are losing by a landslide.  Elaine M. Hinchey Tampa, Florida  PS TO CABIN FEVER READERS: If you've been reading me for awhile you know that I have a very wide taste in music. Everything from old Led Zep to Clannad to Godsmack to Evanescence. I dated a shrink who joked that I should never show anyone my Music Collection because they would diagnose me with Multiple Personality Disorder. I even dated the drummer in a Punk Band. In my pic what you can't see (because it's so dark) is that my hair is so red it's almost black, I have what my mom calls a 'thrasher do' and my head is turned to hide the two earrings in my other ear- one short, one long and both weird. I have been known to threaten the life of anyone who plays Boston's "More Than A Feeling" in my presence! I PRAYED FOR DISCO TO END while listening to the Sex Pistols, The Damned and Lords of The New Church. And in a 'blind taste test' I couldn't tell you the difference between Brittany/Christina or In Sync/Back Street Boys. (Nor would I care!)  What I do care about is the "Thought Police" showing up at my door the next time I write about a Disabled woman being neglected to death by an abusive spouse. Or when I write a pamphlet about an 8-year-old child that had her face blown off by a plastic bullet traveling at 160 m.p.h. by the British Army while she was walking down a deserted side street in Belfast. Or the FBI tapping my phone when I question how Leonard Peltier of the AIM could shoot a FBI agent when he was 5 States away at the time. The only thing we have, besides the documents listed above, to keep the Pro-Censorship lobby from winning is the 'Turn It Off' argument. MTV just took that away from us and I WANT blood. Think about it the next time that you're Posting to your own blog!  Keep the Faith!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever

      Mood: ASHAMED  Playing: EVANESCENCE: FALLEN  Achairde All:   Well, the good news is I've gotten over the writer's block. The bad news (for some) is that I've gotten over the writer's block. I don't know how other writers do it but apparently, for me at least, sheer moral outrage will do it every time. I had originally planned to write about Domestic Violence and the Disabled or what I refer to as "Violence Is NOT A Valentine." But with all the work trying to get money BACK into the Department of Children & Families I shelved it even though only 4 States out of 50 have Programs that deal with this issue. As some of you know I was going to spend this time trying to get an Amendment to the Florida State Constitution on the November ballot. Since I like to have a working thesis for my Social Advocacy’s that would be "After the Common Good" and would require 500,000 Florida signatures by July 16th.   Basically, it would have forced the Governor and the Legislators to cut EVERYTHING, including their salaries and Office Budgets before they could touch a dime of money that is needed for Education and Programs for Children, the Disabled, Elderly, the Homebound. Including other Programs such as Victim's Assistance, Crisis Intervention, etc. I know that it sounds ambitious and I will be the first to agree with you that I probably had a 'snowballs chance in Hell' of getting it done. However, I thought it would wake taxpayers up and let the Government know where we put our priorities. Not in Stadiums, in projects that only benefit One County because they needed someone's vote on something else and that was the 'cost of doing business- Political Style'. I hoped that we could get enough notice that we could shame Florida into doing the right thing and that people in other States would start their own Petitions.   I still think it's a good idea and definitely one whose time has come but I forgot about the children until yesterday. I know, from personal experience, that the Disabled or Special Needs victims are the 'dirty little secret' of Domestic Violence Support. They know it and I know it because years ago, before Dan went from being my bestfriend to being the greatest thing that ever happened in my life, I was married to someone else and I was an Abused Spouse. I can't possibly write all of what needs to be said in one article so I am going to split it up into a series of articles. One a day until my story and the stories of other Survivors are told and we force States to do something for the most vulnerable victims.   To my shame, I only thought about the Disabled Spouse, be they male or female. Until someone, who heard from a friend, that I help other people with Disabilities 'navigate the system' I never thought about the problems facing a Spouse who has a child that is Disabled. I just assumed that if you had children there were programs that helped you. I know that there are Programs for the Disabled I do not qualify for because I am either too young or because Dan and I never had children. For example, I am $20.00 over the limit for Medicaid so all I have is Medicare. Medicaid will pay for prescriptions, transportation and Home Health Assistance. Medicare does not. With Dan gone and my Mom under Hospice Care I have to pay those things on my own. That's a good reason not to have considered the children but it's a damn poor excuse for my blunder.   My experience with the System in what is a Zero Tolerance State (the spouse doesn't press charges- the law enforcement officer does it) was so horrific that one Deputy was suspended for a week without pay and received a letter in his 'jacket'. The other Deputy, the one who wanted to take the man to jail but backed down because her partner had the seniority merely got a letter of reprimand in her file and was assigned a new partner. Part of my agreement not to sue anyone is that now when they teach Domestic Violence Intervention at the Academy they have someone come in and teach them what to look for if the spouse is disabled. You don't have to beat us to kill us you can just neglect us to death. Low-end estimates place people who are listed as having died because of complications or heart attacks actually die from neglect. "She wouldn't take her medicine." Or "He just quit eating" So the Coroner doesn't look any further. After all, they had been 'sick' for a long time and it happens, right?   So, I'm going to keep things down to a manageable size until you understand the problem. Hopefully then you will help me make those other 48 Governors aware of the problem.   But most importantly, let's not forget the children.   Slan leat,  Elaine  AKA Cabin Fever

       Mood: WRITERS BLOCK  Playing: KING CRIMSON: COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING  You are the silver moonlight. You have a deep soul. Many people call you mysterious but they just don't know you. You are often alone but shine hope on every one else. People look up to you and call to you for advice. You have been betrayed but you have forgaven them. Your faith in life has made you an inspiration to us all. You are intelligent, quiet, beautiful, and kind. You will become very sucessful. Your dream career could maybe deal with the joy of music. Keep up the spirit and let your mind drift to the shining hope of the silver moon.       urlLink What shade of moonlight are you? (Boys or Girls)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.      urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Your a punk message me!You dont kare what other peeps say you are OuT there     urlLink            pUnK?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Well, as you can see, I have what is commonly known as "Writer's Block". In case you've never had it you can take my word that it is an absolutely HORRIBLE FEELING. Especially bad is when you have a great thesis half worked out and then :::::::::SLAM::::::::: you hit it- THE WALL. You can try and climb over, walk around or tunnel under it and still (even if you live by the "I Can't Drive 55" Motto) can't catch the rest of it. In other words, just pull over to the side cause you aren't going anywhere, fast! You all know my mottoes by now: "Always Fire A Warning Shot!"; "Lead, Follow Or Get The Hell Out Of My Way" and "Democracy Can Be Fun!" Basically, because you don't have to clean up the crime scene and voting some jerk out of office lasts longer, is more enjoyable and it won't make your neighbors nervous. (The last one I 'shared' with Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein.) Not exactly Zen but it works for me.  So, I go 'looking for things to do'. Trust me on this but there are few things scarier then someone searching for something to do. Yeah, once in a great while someone will find a vaccine or invent post-it notes but basically you are going to enter the 5th Ring Around The Inferno and do something stupid. Not just any kind of stupid either- we're talking NORSE FREAKIN' EPIC SAGA ‘STOO-PID’! Even scarier is that men and women are genetically coded into two very different tracks of stupidity. Go ahead and say it's sexist if you want. Just remember that doesn't make it any less true. Men tend toward the outwardly stupid and women to the personally stupid end of the spectrum. The only thing they have in common is that horrific, "What in The Name of God/The Goddess was I thinking!" scream that comes 5 seconds after you return to whatever degree of sanity you had previously.  Men will fix things that aren't broke. There he is standing by what remains of your great-grandmother’s rocking chair! (You know the one that was already a 200-year-old family heirloom BEFORE she brought over on the boat when she immigrated to this country?) Yep, that’s the one! It has managed to survive TWO WORLD WARS, several police actions, 9-11 AND the worst flooding your state has seen since they kept records about such things. Then, AFTER the Vallium injection they gave you in the ER kicks in he will say, "But Honey, you said it squeaked. I was just trying to fix it for you because I love you and I want you to be happy. I was only trying to help!" Oh Please! Even under the influence of enough tranquilizers to drop Seabiscuit women will groggily answer with, "I know Baby, but I thought we agreed, after the last time, that you wouldn't bring THE CHAINSAW  INTO THE HOUSE EVER AGAIN! You bought the 84-oz. can of WD40 because it was on sale. It was right there on your work bench and while I am still unable to kill you in some painfully inventive way- you want to tell me how you found the key to the cabinet that holds the power-tools in the first place? It was in the bottom of a box of Tampons for Heaven’s sake!"  Women are bit more complex. Our stupidity is multi-faceted. We will clean something that involves us creating a mixture of household chemicals prohibited by the United Nations Ban On Weapons of Mass Destruction. Hone our culinary skills and try out some new recipe from "101 Easy Ways to Cook Skunk" or "Road-Kill to Them, Entrée to You!" But the worst, and along the lines of 'no gas operated tools in the living room' is our Adventures In Personal Grooming. Whereby we apply a 'soothing skin refreshing mask you can make at home' and wake up looking like Freddy's little sister AFTER a couple dozen slasher-flicks! We will, in fact, dye our hair colors no hair should ever be- I, myself, once was aiming for 'Burgundy Fire' and got 'Barney Purple' after inspiration convinced me to leave it in 15 extra minutes. But the very worst is that we will exfoliate things. Which, at the time seemed like a good idea BUT what was marginally cool on one day can leave you wishing that you had fallen buck-naked into a patch of chiggers the next. Because what you shave today WILL start to grow back tomorrow. Then he won't need the key anymore- Power Sander? Don't bother! Because before you can remember the new place you hid it you will be happy to oblige and beg him to let you strip the 12' Armoire's old varnish off yourself. If that doesn’t take care of the problem you will go Questing for MORE furniture to refinish BECAUSE you will do anything to STOP THE ITCH!  Which is why I stick to Quizilla. Even though I'm a Protector/Silver Moonlight/Entrancing Kiss/PUNKER who, according to them, is most like Gandhi in "What Historical Figure Are You?" It's a much safer, albeit strange, way to deal with Writer's Block or Boredom!  Keep the Faith Folks!  Slan leat, Elaine  AKA Cabin Fever

      Mood: OVER DRIVE  Playing: LIVE: PEOPLE LIKE YOU  YOU SAID TODAY SO HERE IT IS:   Achairde All:  Apparently the number we did on Jeb's Computer was something that took more than a few hours to fix! If you didn't get an Auto-Response yet this is what it's supposed to look like:  This is a receipt for the mail you sent to "Jeb Bush"   at 1/19/04 1:14 AM  This receipt verifies that the message has been displayed on the recipient's computer at 1/30/04 12:25 PM  It took him from 1/19 until 1/30 to send mine and look how early in The Day I sent it. Also, the week of the Email Action Jeb gave a speech about Disabilities and the money he was going to return to the Homebound Budget.  So.......YA DONE GOOD PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!  Now the question is do we let the governors, Congress and the President cut benefits to the following type of programs:  1) PARC- a group that advocates, maintains group homes and assistance to Developmentally challenged Adults. Often these are people whose parents have died and they have no other Care Givers.  2) Victim’s Assistance- Domestic Violence Intervention and Post-Rape Trauma Aid have been cut or drastically reduced.  3) Medically Needy- a program that helps the Children, the Disabled and the Elderly pay medical expenses and obtains medications has been drastically reduced and no longer pays Medicare premiums. The money taken out for the premium is often the money these people use to purchase food, over-the-counter medications and transportation.  And those are just a few. I have gotten email after email from people who are in need of help as well as people in other States that want our help starting their own Campaigns. The "FTWCS" was never a Cabin Fever thing or even an Elaine thing. It was all of us working together. Do we walk away?   I started a Forum Thread about blogs being a (potential) force for Political and Social change. We made Internet History once. I think, no I KNOW, that we can do it again.  There is one other thing. I don't want my benefits back at the expense of children simply because I vote and they don't. To me that is not the sort of 'victory' I want to achieve. Is it yours? Didn’t think so.  I do have an idea. It is called “After the Common Good” but I’ve got to eat, take my meds and defrost my feet. It’s rather a simple idea but an obvious one. It also might be just a wee bit more ambitious for some of you since involves a petition, an alliance and a place on the ballot to change Florida’s Constitution. Hopefully it will also be taken up by people in the other 49 States and Territories. Since I don’t want to be lost in the shuffle I think I’ll wait until after the Super Bowl to Post it. Or should I do it this weekend? I’ll abide by the majority’s opinion.  Keep the Faith!  Slan leat, Elaine  AKA Cabin Fever

How can we beat a man so skilled? Its "Son of Mr. Resume."  _________________  RESUME:   GEORGE W. BUSH  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, DC 20520   EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:   Law Enforcement:  I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been "lost" and is not available.   Military:  I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   College:  I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:  I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975.I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our friends in the oil industry(including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:  I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the Supreme Court, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:  I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record .  I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.  I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history.   I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any12-month period I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.   In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend continues every month. I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My "poorest millionaire," Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time US and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations. My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. History, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the US. Supreme Court during my election decision.   I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history. I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed. I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history. I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. Withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspector's access to U.S. "prisoners of war" detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S election).   I set the record for fewest numbers of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protests against any person in the history of mankind.   I am the first President in U.S history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community.   I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits for active duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq and then blamed the lies on our British friends am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans(71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear "Tactical Bunker Buster," a WMD.I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden [sic]to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review. PLEASE CONSIDER MY EXPERIENCE WHEN VOTINGIN 2004.  PLEASE SEND THIS TO EVERY VOTER YOU KNOW   Now I don’t want to sound nasty BUT THESE PEOPLE DO AN AWFUL LOT OF BITCHING (writing) WITHOUT DOING ONE DAMN THING CONCRETE ABOUT IT! So here’s what I fired back at him. It includes the response I gave to Raven on his AIM request:  January 31, 2004 - 10:42 AM new  Re: BEATING THE BUSH'S!   Come on over to www.cabinfever.modblog.com to see how we avoid being part of the problem. Or go to Native Americans here at Tribe. I have been asked to write a petition and here is my response:   Date 2004-01-31 10:30:29.0  Subject Re: AIM TO BE ADDED TO TERRORIST LIST  Message January 31, 2004 - 10:27 AM   That's the point - ONLY IF WE LET THEM!!!   Look, I don't want to lay a Shame Trip on anyone (as a dear friend said, "Jewish mothers do guilt and Irish mothers do shame!") but what are you going to do about it? Me, I write and write and then write some more. I know everyone in my Political Food Chain and when I'm not writing I'm telephoning them.   No excuses either. I don't care how old or young you are. How busy you are with school, life, love or whatever. I don't even care how Disabled you are because I have Brain Damage and Seizures that can't be controlled because a Drunk Driver decided 13 years ago to take a short cut through my body. Last year I was in Hospital twice near death and once because I was in danger of losing my left leg. I have been running an Email Campaign against Jeb Bush over at ModBlog and I have literally come out of a seizure on the floor next to my chair. Taken my meds and got back in the chair and took up where the last sentence ended!   You want me to write a Petition and I accept. I will write it, post it at the two best Petition sites I know and I will set up an email address with links to the appropriate officials.   But since I am still running a Campaign against Jeb Bush taking money from children, the disabled, the elderly and the homebound. (Of which I am 2 out of 4- Disabled and Homebound) And one against George Bush trying to re-write the Extradition Treaty with the Brits that strips the Irish and Irish Americans who support a United Ireland of the right to an extradition hearing, Habeas Corpus and basic Civil rights even if THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO BE EXTRADITED FOR! I've got to ask you all a question. What are YOU prepared to do?   You see my Mother raised us to stand up for ourselves and others. If you bitched about some political or social issue, she'd listen patiently and then hit you with, "Well, what are you going to do about it?" Also, if you are eligible to Vote and didn't SHUT UP. People who DO NOT show up at the Polls DO NOT have the right to complain." Don't try the excuse, "Well, I didn't know who to vote for." That happens all the time. I may not know who I want to vote for but I can damn well tell you whom I'll vote AGAINST! The DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BAD AND WORSE IS MUCH GREATER THAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND BETTER!   So, if I do this what are you and all the other people in Native American or Digital Rez or wherever prepared to do? I am running the Jeb campaign with 7 people, who live in four different States and 3 different countries. Those who aren’t working on the Strategy and Logistics are emailing their fingers off! We have no dues, no Home Office and no salaried staff. We are also, according to the Fox News Network the first all Internet Human Rights Campaign.   So before I start typing what are you going to do? As for the response that some tyranny is needed I will leave you with one last thought. "All that is required for evil to flourish is for good people to do nothing!"   Elaine   Now, in all fairness I will admit that Tribe.net is much, much bigger than ModBlog but I think it speaks volumes that they come to US for REAL Action! That includes the Cabin Fever mirror site I put there. All through the “FTWCS” Campaign and beyond there were 12 people who responded! So they can keep Live Journal, BlogSpot and the rest. As far as I’m concerned, MODBLOG AND THE PEOPLE HERE RULE!  Stay tuned for Part Two later!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever

      Mood: NO MORE NICE CATHOLIC GIRL!  Playing: ANATHEMA: INNER SILENCE   This is the reply I sent to the the Distinguished Member of The Fouth Estate for running his Annual Chili info the day after informing a several hundred thousand people Jeb was cutting services to children. I didn't care for the abrupt change in subject. The most important part is the last line in the last paragraph.  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever  January 29th, 2004 Tampa, Florida USA  Re: Your Column of 25 Jan 04 Your Column of 26 Jan 04  Dear Mr. Otto:  I am a great fan of your work and regret that until today I have not written you to thank you for the laughter and memories you have given me. I also regret that I must inform you that I found your switch between Developmentally Handicapped Children and your Chili Cook-Off to be glib and unworthy of you. I am quite certain that you did not mean it to be so but it was definitely a poor choice to run one right after another. Though I am taking it on faith that you did not mean to you contributed to a problem that effects those children, the Disabled and the Elderly. It is known as "Marginalization".  Thirteen years ago I was hit by a Drunk Driver and suffered, among other things, Traumatic Brain Injury. Before then I had been a highly functional woman who left Commercial Insurance to become a teacher. I was also a Human Rights Lobbyist and writer. I was primarily concerned with the American Indian Movement (AIM), Amnesty International, the Irish American Unity Conference. I also worked the third year of the MacBride Principals, during which time we managed to get it out of the Florida State House and 'weasal' it past then Governor Martinez. I learned to read at the age of 3 and I had to learn again at age 31. I thought my Activist Days were over.  On October 16th of 2003 I was, by State employees, told to move out of the State of Florida because Florida could no longer support it's Disabled & Homebound. October the 17th I called Jeb Bush's office. I went from Alia Faraj, his Press Secretary. She had John Kuczwanski of the Department of Management of Services call me and he passed me on to Julie Shaw. Ms. Shaw is the Executive Director of the Governors Working Group on the ADA, with less than satisfactory results. I recently begun to write an Online Column entitled "Cabin Fever" for the people without Disabilities so that they can understand what it's like to be Disabled. Basically because people have marginalized the Disabled, especially the Disabled such as myself who are also Homebound, into these 'out of touch relics' without an opinion worth a damn. Suddenly, despite cheating Death on the 5th of December, I found myself the Director of the "For Those Who Cannot Speak" Email Campaign against Jeb Bush.  We emailed the Governor on January 19th, choosing this date to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., from all over Florida, the United States and several other countries. In fact, we sent so many emails we overloaded Jeb's Auto-Response Program and Inbox. Copies were sent to President Bush, governors of other States as well as the Presidents or Prime Ministers of other Nations. The Fox Network said we were the first all Internet Human Rights campaign in Internet History. No dues, no Home Office, no salaried Staff and the people who directed it lived in 4 States and 3 counties. The age range of the emailers ranged from 13 to 97.  The Tampa Tribune knew all of this through copies sent to Donna Koehn and an eLectronic Press Release. Yet I do not know of one Tribune employee who bothered to send an email despite the fact that we had backing from several national groups (AOH, Knights of Columbus, NAACP-USA, etc.) When I read your columns online only to see you segue from a passing mention about children being deprived of assistance to Chili recipes and political analogies I wondered if I had fallen through some sort of Looking Glass. The most disturbing dichotomy was the sense that the first column was only a token piece and the second was much more important to you. The second column also featured the old maxim about people not knowing when to leave well enough alone.   There was a time when depriving children, the disabled and the elderly of basic food, medicine and medical attention would have sent ripples of outrage from the Front Page to the Op-Ed’s with every columnist chiming in along the way. Apparently those days are gone. We who advocate for those who are unable to do it themselves also have a maxim. "All that is required for evil to flourish is that good people do nothing."

      Mood: NO MORE NICE CATHOLIC GIRL!  Playing: ANATHEMA: INNER SILENCE   Well, that was fun but it was also enough of a break. I'll put up a Poll for you to vote on my Personality Issues. Now I'm afraid Jeb does NOT appear to have paid enough attention to the fact we flooded his Inbox and shut down his Auto-Response Program. Sometimes you just can't people's attention unless you 'beat 'um with The Stupid Stick'! Figuratively, that is. Now he's broadened his Theatre of Depredations to include...Yep, Children! And not just any children- Developmentally Disabled Children. This AMADUAN (Gaelige for Male Fool) makes Scrooge look good even BEFORE his Midnight Visitors!  Now, I also took umbrage at a columnist from the Tampa Tribune. He followed the column (you need to read) below the next day with one dealing with his Annual Chili Cook-Off! Can we say Marginalization! SURE YA CAN! So, I felt a response was needed. This is going to be a Part A & B Column. Right now I need to know if we ignore this or ramp it up. I’m betting you vote for the latter. There are children who are betting on you as well. I’ll wait a wee bit and Post Part B to give everyone a chance to weigh in.   Do we let the Brothers Bush steal from Children? Yea or Nay. There are no Maybes on this one.  Slan leat, Elaine  AKA Cabin Fever  TAMPA TRIBUNE: Jeb Decides To Leave Some Kids Behind STEVE OTTO  Published: Jan 25, 2004  What the governor's budget needs is a title, something glib and meaningless. You know, like when the space shuttle blasts off and you hear the voice on the TV saying, ``Endeavour, on a mission to grow mushrooms in space!'' It adds flair.   It's even better if the slogan has little to do with actual results.  A good model would be the president's education legislation, the one with the feel-good title of No Child Left Behind. It might be called correctly Most Children Dragged Down, but that's another story.   So last week, when Jeb Bush stood up and outlined his proposed state budget for 2004-05, he should have given it a zippy name like $55 Billion and You Still Owe Us or Hey, It's Your Money.   The thing about an instrument of this size is that even if you speak budgetese, it's almost incomprehensible. It is the sort of thing that lets you spend a few million dollars more than you did last time and still be stripping something bare.   A few things are obvious.   Once again, the most vulnerable in our state are going to get the short end. Is that a surprise?   The young, the old, the disabled will be the losers.    Pushing Buttons   Among those failures, one of the more obvious involves children without health insurance. The particular program is called KidCare.   This is a complex state and federal program that uses Medicaid money to cover health expenses for children from poor families. The program has a waiting list of more than 100,000 children, including nearly 10,000 in the Tampa Bay area.   I called my old friend Dennis Penzell to talk about it.   He's the medical director of the Suncoast Community Clinic in Ruskin, a hands-on place that provides health care to nearly 30,000 people.   Where it is especially strong is in early intervention, in getting care to families that once used emergency rooms for primary care.   I didn't have to push too many buttons to get the good doctor fired up.   It is outrageous, he said. Who knows how many diseases we could have diagnosed, how many far more serious problems down the road we could have prevented, if we could get these children into a doctor's office early on?   We have to give families the security of knowing they don't have to sacrifice meals for health care.    Saving Money   Then Penzell made another argument.   You have to wonder why politicians don't push this idea when looking for money, he said. You always save money on the front end of health care. You can see the results we have measured with the Hillsborough County health care program.   That's the program using a fraction of a cent in sales tax to give basic care to the county's poor, which saves us from spending even more on subsidized emergency care.   Even if you don't care about creating healthier children and families, Penzell said, you can always justify it by the money you will be saving taxpayers.   Let me ask you something. Why is it that there are health insurance programs for the elderly and not for the very young?   It was a rhetorical question. Penzell went ahead with his answer: The elderly can vote. Children do not.   Of course, this is only Jeb's proposal. By the time the Legislature gets through with it, we'll probably have poor kids working in sweatshops to make specialty license plates that say: No Child Left Behind - Or Insured.

      Mood: A WEE BIT MORE IMPISH CURIOUSITY  Playing: ANATHEMA: THE SILENT ENIGMA      You are one of the few out there whose wings are truly  ANGELIC . Selfless, powerful, and divine, you are one blessed with a certain cosmic grace. You are unequalled in peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of Light your wings are massive and a soft white or silver. Countless feathers grace them and radiate the light within you for all the world to see. You are a defender, protector, and caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver of the wrong, chances are you are taken advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often. But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in everyone and so this mistreatment does not make you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will try to help misguided souls find themselves and peace. However not all Angelics allow themselves to be gotten the better of - the Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting for the sake of Justice and protection of those less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever change - the world needs more people like you.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Mood: MORE IMPISH CURIOSITY  Playing: EVANESCENCE: BRING ME TO LIFE      You are a  PHOENIX  in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly. Though you can be stubborn, outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Mood: CONFLICTED  Playing: NEIL DIAMOND: I AM, I SAID  Y'all ever go to quickly? I do. I like quizzes, they frustrate the Hell out of me, but I like them anyway. The problem is there's always 1 question that comes down to 2 equally valid answers. In this case it was the raven or the wolf. Now, I like ravens because they belong to the Irish Goddess The Morrigu. One of her names is The Raven of Battle. But my Cherokee side loves wolves. If I chose wolf I'm the "Woman of Mystery". If I chose raven I'm the "Warrior Woman". The problem is that I can't choose one over the other, so there I am, "Stuck in the middle with you!"   Readers who've been around awhile remember the Inconsistency Issue. One choice and I have an Artistic Soul another and I have a Sorrowful Soul. It happens all the time. I'm either The Force of Light or The Force of Wind. I'm a Ghost or I'm an Angel. When I was in College I took the Androgyny Scale in Psych of Personal Growth. My professor said I was the first totally androgynous student she ever had. In other words, I have as many 'male personality' characteristics as I do 'female'. Now, I'm not bi-polar, bi-sexual or have any identity issues. I'm just me. Always have been, always will be. The programming changes with the times but the hardware stays the same, to use a Net Friendly analogy.   Does it help that my Mother and all of my sisters score as Androgynous as well? Some. I wouldn't be confused if weren't for the fact that the lines of demarcation (one or the other) have been there over many years and many types of tests- silly or serious. I'm beginning to wonder why?   One of the best ways to know someone is by reading the thoughts that come from deep within them. I've certainly done that here. Love, death, sickness, anger, fright and fight. If you've been reading me for awhile you've read them all. So maybe you can explain it to me.   Why am I 'neither fish, nor fowl'? The only time I've ever felt whole was with Daniel. Now that he's gone I feel like half of me went with him. It's funny really. I test out as two separate people and I don't even feel like one.   I'd really like your answers.   Slan leat,  Elaine  AKA Cabin Fever

       Mood : ROTFLMAO   Playing : QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE: THE SKY IS FALLIN'  Achairde All:  Well, I thank everyone who made their calls already and I am (gently) reminding everyone who hasn't to PLEASE call your Domestic Violence Hotline and tell them that you have been reading some very disturbing facts and you would like to know if your State has facilities to deal with Abuse Victims who also happen to be Disabled or have children that are. If they answer that they don't know or will have to check with someone else tell them that you would appreciate it because you don't want to see your family, friends or neighbors go through what you have read here.  Also, I would like to know their answer if you don't mind.  No biggie, leave it in the CB like MBOS did.  This is odds and ends day at Cabin Fever.  Remember the list of people who were NOT helpful with the "FTWCS Email Campaign" ?  Well, no surprise but the Republicans were the WORST offenders.  In fact they were SO bad here is my response to an email they sent me asking for money and my time:  BUSH-CHENEY '04, Inc. Mailto:BushCheney04@GeorgeWBush.com   TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:  You know it's odd.  I am a Republican in fact I am a Republican Team Leader.  Yet when I was working on a Disability Rights campaign I received receipts from:  Bob Graham (R-FL) Ed Gillespie, (R) Team Leader Marc Racicot, (R) Chairman, Bush/Cheney 2004 Committee  that actually read, "Your email has been returned WITHOUT being read."  NOW you want money from me AND my vote?!  Let me tell you how I felt I could reelect President Bush.  I printed out ALL THOSE RECEIPTS (and there were several of them) and I sent hard copies to Kerry, Dean and Congressman Maurice Hinchey (D-NY and a cousin) along with a message that said.  Whichever Democrat comes out ahead has MY REPUBLICAN VOTE.  In fact, since I write an online column I am publishing this email there so all of my readers can learn from it.  You people are the reason the Republican Party has such a bad reputation and decent people hate us.  When you get some ethics or the Party decides to run someone who does feel free to contact me.  Unlike you- I WILL have the common courtesy to read your email.  Until then, save us both some time and take me off this list.  Sincerely, Elaine M. Hinchey Cabin Fever Online http://www.cabinfever.modblog.com    Their response:  Thank You!   Thank you for your interest in Bush-Cheney '04! With your commitment to re-electing President Bush you can be a leader in his campaign. As a Bush Volunteer you will be a key member of the President's grassroots team. We challenge you to accomplish up to six important tasks:   Recruit 5 Other Bush Volunteers  Sign Up 10 Friends or Family to Receive Bush Email Updates  Write Letters to the Editor & Call Talk Radio Shows  Host a Block Party  Help Turn Out the Vote for President Bush  Volunteer for the President at Local Events   Now is it me or is that hilarious?  Even funnier is this:    I am an Intellectual    urlLink     Which America Hating Minority Are You?     urlLink Take More Robert & Tim Quizzes   urlLink Watch Robert & Tim Cartoons      I'd write some more but one of the first lessons in writing an effective article is knowing when to quit when you have a great finish.  That was a GREAT finish.  Keep the Faith! Elaine AKA Cabin Fever

      Mood: HOPE  Playing: OLD LULLABY: TURN AROUND (WHERE ARE YOU GOING MY LITTLE ONE?)  As bad as my experience in 'The System' was it could have been worse, mindbogglingly worse. I could have tried to navigate it with children. And lest you think, "Oh, she lives in the South and we all know how backward they are!" Let me tell you that the woman I am writing about experienced her nightmare in New York City. Also, it was SO bad that the Salvation Army PAID for her and her children to come to Tampa. Which was part of the South the last time I looked. So, let's not get on any Regional High Horses here, OK!  The woman, Allie (named changed for security reasons) was a battered woman. She also has two Special Needs children. Her son, who is 17, was involved in a Drowning Incident as a child and although he is almost an adult he has the mind of a 10-year-old. An innocent mind, not one of those preternaturally adult-like children you see on television or in the movies. He has what my people call, a 'sweetness of soul'. Her daughter, who is 16, has severe Epilepsy and ADD/ADHD issues. Their father, who was also severely epileptic, died from an accident that occurred during one of his seizures. She remarried and like me, said I do to Dr. Jeckyl and woke up with Mr. Hyde. He never abused the children but she was another matter. He had no problems beating the Hell out of her.  If you read the third part of this series you know what kind of services that aren't out there for people with Disabilities. One of my readers wrote me his exact words were:  " According to the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearings of 1990, there are three times as many animal shelters in the U.S. as there are shelters for battered women"  That is ridiculous and insulting!  What could I say to that? What would YOU say? The best I could come up with was:  "I couldn't agree with you more. Unfortunately, I can't seem to get the Government to agree with us."  I gave you the same information that anyone, who has 3 or 4 days free to do research, is going to find when they go looking for answers. The biggest problem is that the people doing the abusing are the one's who are caregivers, breadwinners and the ones with the all-important Health Insurance. Don't write me about Medicare or Medicaid because the list of what they WON'T cover is longer than the list of what they will. Allie knew this all too well. Which is why she put up with years of abuse and humiliation. Her kids needed help she couldn't afford to give them on her own even if she had a job with better medical benefits. Everytime he beat her she would tell herself it was worth it as long as her children were safe and getting the medical attention and educational assistance they needed. However, one of her neighbors didn't agree with her.  They got the Police and the Social Worker's involved and pretty soon SHE'S the perp and not the victim. If she doesn't leave her husband the Great State of New York was going to take her to Court and TAKE HER CHILDREN AWAY FROM HER FOR BEING AN UNFIT MOTHER EVEN THOUGH THEY AGREED THAT HER SPOUSE COULD PAY FOR SERVICES HER CHILDREN NEEDED BUT THE STATE OF NEW YORK WOULD NOT PAY FOR.  They didn't even give her time to pack a few things- including her daughter's Dilantin because the Police wanted her out of there before her husband got home so that THEY wouldn't have to deal with him. They put her in an apartment in a building used to shelter women and their families. She had no clothes, no furniture, no kitchen supplies and more importantly NO DILANTIN for her daughter. For three weeks she was told that she was "In a Transition Shelter" and that when she was moved to a more permanent place she would get those items. When she explained that Dilantin was NOT something that her daughter could wait for she was assured that it was. "On the top of our list." It was still on their list two weeks later when her daughter was beginning to have exceptionally severe seizures.  Now you would think that this was bad enough. The Social Workers could make her move out of her home at a moment’s notice but they couldn't get a prescription filled? Bad, right? It got worse. Her son, who is the average height, weight, etc. for a 17 year old boy but doesn't have the mental capabilities. He is also very attractive. This is the NIGHTMARE WITHOUT END for parents with Special Needs children. Their child being raped, being accused of rape or having sex without understanding what they're doing. Another resident of the Transition House was a woman who, after years of abuse was none too stable. She made a move on the son, fortunately someone came along and to cover her embarrassment she claimed that he had forced oral sex on her.  Allie still doesn't have her daughter's prescription. She can't go out and get it in case her husband discovers where she is. However, for this they could drag her across NYC and make her life a living Hell. She had 2 choices. EVEN THOUGH THE SOCIAL WORKERS KNEW TO A MORAL CERTAINTUDE THE WOMAN WAS LYING. She could move to the "High Risk Shelter" which was, as she was informed, "Undergoing a severe pest control problem the exterminators had yet to resolve or you can send your son to your sisters in (Another Borough)." Since severe pest control problems mean rat's bigger than your dachshund (and let me assure you that is possible. When they excavated the old docks in Baltimore they found 40lb rats!) She chose to send her son to her sister's.  Unfortunately, as neighborhoods go her sisters wasn't the safest. One of his cousins was 'assigned to look after him'. Some of the locals thought it was great fun to 'pick on the dummy' and in the process of protecting him the cousin was STABBED THREE TIMES IN THE CHEST. That was the final straw. Allie found the number of the local Salvation Army and begged them to help her. Since she had another relative here in Tampa they paid for the plane tickets and costs in getting her resettled here. She came to me for help navigating the Florida Social System. This all occurred between October of 2003 and February of 2004.  THIS IS NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK IN AMERICA. WE ARE ONE OF THE RICHEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. WE (SHOULD) TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN!  But, as you can see, we don't. That is horrific. When we fail to take care of our Disabled, especially when they are children it defies description and I am good at description. So, in answer to the inevitable, "What does she want me to do? I don't live in either Florida or New York. Besides, what can I do that will make any difference?" Here's my answer:  I would like everyone who reads this to make one telephone call to your local Domestic Violence Hotline. I want you to tell them that you have been reading some very disturbing facts and you would like to know if your State has facilities to deal with Abuse Victims who also happen to be Disabled or have children that are. If they answer that they don't know or will have to check with someone else tell them that you would appreciate it because you don't want to see your family, friends or neighbors go through what you have read here.  Go to Cabin Fever at ModBlog.  Take a look at the picture of my parents and I on my Christening Day. No one wants their child to grow up and to be Disabled and Abused. They don't want the child that they are holding in their arms on this happy occasion to have to choose between being beaten and humiliated to obtain health and education assistance for their children or enter into a degrading and indifferent Social System. Do it because it will take 5 minutes out of your busy week and because it's the right thing to do.  In other words, let us all remember the children!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever

         Mood: YA GOTTA PLAY THE HAND THAT'S DEALT YA  Playing: GARTH BROOKS: THE DANCE  Achairde All:  From time to time I get email or messages from people who want to know, “…If you’re so Disabled why don’t you write more about it.” I try to explain to them that while I am Disabled it isn’t ALL that I am and it isn’t all that my life’s about. But from time to time I will write about something that’s taking place on the Med Front. (Remember the Medication Poisoning last December or the Fractured Ankle some weeks ago?) Now, I have to write about something that you might find a bit Scary (it SURE scares the Hell out of me) and might be a bit hard for you all to read. To be honest, it’s really NOT something I really want to SHARE but in the back of my mind there’s always that Voice of Conscience prodding me on, “If it helps just ONE person then you HAVE to do it!” (After 44 years that V.O.C. thing is starting to truly HACK me off!) LOL  I guess the first thing we need to agree on it that men and women have different bodies. Now BEFORE you Award me one of my own Stupid Sticks I am stating the obvious because an alarming number of young women seem to be are unaware that this difference means different maintenance schedules, so to speak. The SAME woman who won’t go over 3,000 miles on the odometer before she goes in for a new Oil Filter and a few quarts of 10/30 wt. WILL go 5 years BETWEEN visits to a Gynecologist. PRIORITY CHECK LADIES!  Now, I have never been one of those women. It could be because I come from a family with all female offspring, it could be because my ‘Friend” rolled into town when I was 11 so that by the time I was when I was 12 I looked 18 (or as my Dad put it so very eloquently, “15 to Life if you touch her!”), but I don’t think it was for either of those reasons. It probably stems from the fact that generations of women on both sides of my family have possessed a through knowledge and understanding of medicinal pharmacopoeia along with COMMON SENSE. My Mom’s mother used to be a “Lying in Nurse” before she was married. She would stay with an expectant mother just before the birth, help the Doctor and stay until the woman was back on her feet. (No 24-Hour checkouts when you have your baby at Home and are expected to stay in bed for at least a week after the event!)  Guys, if you were wondering why you need to know this information then YOU deserve to be beaten about the head and neck with the aforementioned Stupid Stick! You had a mother, you may have female siblings or other relatives and you may someday create ANOTHER female with a female. If you bought a Chilton for your new car or are constantly tweaking your PC then the least you can do is help with the Required Female Upkeep!  So, where does my problem figure into all of this? After my visit to the Cardiac ICU last July I started a brief Period of Irregularity. Pardon the pun! Which was not all that surprising since I was turning 44 in September. (Which just might make me the Grande Dame of ModBlog!) I mentioned it to my Doctors during my monthly appointments. I didn’t really miss it that much and I was having hot flashes ~ but since my medications also cause them I didn’t pay much attention to them. What did concern me was that I was eating Midol PMS tabs like they were Tic Tacs and Menopause is supposed to take place gradually over several months or even years. Mine was less than 6 months.  During my last regular Blood Work-Up ~ I have them every 3 months, they took a couple of extra vials for various and sundry tests. (5 of the regular ones and 3 of the big ones ~ I felt like a guest Vic on BTVS! I actually got lightheaded!) I had an appointment on May 6th to get my refills, my results and a little Stirrup-Time. (There’s a blank I’ll leave you to deal with yourselves. Let’s just say, “There is NO dignity in a Paper Dress!) After THAT little ‘Trip to The Moon On Gossamer Wings’ (Yes, I AM being sarcastic!) I sat down to discuss the status of my lacking anything that even vaguely resembles Health and got a nasty surprise.  To understand HOW BAD it is I’ll have to go a wee bit TMI on you good people. I have NEVER had ‘Female Troubles’. My Period was SO regular you could have set your watch by it! 27 ¾ days, arrived at 2:00AM except when we “Fell Back in Fall” when it would arrive at 1:00AM and 3 ½ days in duration. My Doctor then proceeds to tell me that I am NOT in Menopause or even Perimenopause! In fact, the blood test to tell you where you are on the Hormonal Hit Parade runs from 1 to 30. 1 being Nubile and 30 being Menopausal. I SCORED A 1.62!!! That’s not even in the Peri Starting Gate and MOST women get there in their 30s. Then there’s another ‘Visual Test’ (and there isn’t ENOUGH XANAX IN THE WORLD THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO REMAIN CALM WHILE ‘SHARING’ THE DETAILS OF THAT PROCEDURE SO WE’LL SKIP IT!) and it runs from 1 to 7. I scored a 1 which means I could open my own International House of Hormones ~ if we could FIGURE OUT WHERE THE HELL THEY’RE HIDING!  Which means that ALL is NOT well below Periscope Depth. And since there hasn’t been a really bright Star in The East since April 21st of 2001 I am definitely NOT pregnant. Now, I must admit that I am bitter about the situation (also Terrified ~ but we’ll cover that later) BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO CAREFUL. When I was in my 20s one of my roommates sister’s produced a 8 ½ Tumor and had to have ALL her pipes removed because she hadn’t bothered to have a Pelvic Exam in 5 or 6 years. SHE WAS 21! Her excuse? SHE DIDN’T LIKE THE EXAMINATION BECAUSE IT WAS TOO INTRUSIVE! Obviously her idea of intrusive didn't mesh with mine. NO ONE LIKES THE DAMN EXAM BUT REAL INTRUSION IS SPLITTING YOU OPEN AND YANKING ORGANS OUT, YOU IJIT!   These are the Basics Boys and Girls: an Exam every damn year unless you are using the Pill ~ then it’s every six months. For guys, if you’re seeing Active Duty I would suggest a yearly check up as well. Don’t wait until you can hit that really high note in the National Anthem every time you use the bathroom before you head to an ER. Doctors are cheaper, easier and you don’t have to go in crying like baby! Oh, before I forget, ladies you CAN buy a box of condoms once in awhile and gentlemen there is NOTHING embarrassing about contributing to Ortho-Novum’s bottom line as well. Sharing the responsibility is as much an Act of Love as what you’re buying them for. Taking care of your health is another way. Remember that on May 1st we Pledged that we would take personal responsibility for our actions. Applying that Pledge to your Intimate Life is not only responsible and loving ~ it’s an Affirmation of Life!  As for me, well there are nasty and Invasive Days ahead. It might just be a benign tumor or it could be cancer (Cervical or Ovarian, etc.). One thing I DO have going in my FAVOR is that I DIDN’T let it go on for years and that GREATLY increases my Survival Chances. The reason that I’m telling you all of this is in the hope that you will remember my words and that they may one day help to increase your chances or the chances of someone you love!  Ya gotta play the Hand you’re dealt. There’s no getting around that fact, but for God’s sake People, see that you play it SMART!

        Mood: WHERE ON THE PAIN SCALE ARE WE? TEN BEING THE WORSE. (NURSE) WE, I DON’T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I’M AT 12 ~ 14 IS WHEN I GO UP IN A TOWER WITH A 30-30 TO MEDICATE MYSELF SO I’D GET THE DOCTOR RIGHT ABOUT NOW! (ME)  Playing: SPANDAU BALLET: (TO CUT A) LONG STORY SHORT  Achairde All:  For our newbies “Odds & Ends Day” here at Cabin Fever Online is when I do a wee bit of House Cleaning. I tie up lose ends, take care of a few things that I don’t think should take up a whole column or just toss a few ideas out and see what reaction I get. However, I would first like to THANK QWERTY8447, Me Q, or as he is known to me as, My Q. Basically because of all the work he did on the FTWCS Campaign AND because if James Bond had My Q instead of his he would have been WAY cooler and had a better website! LOL He is the Designer Extraordinaire of the New & Improved CFO Logo. I don’t know HOW he did it But I LOVE IT!!! Massive {{{{{{{{{My Q}}}}}}}}}}!  It also takes place when Life needs Drano in a BAD way! I would say, “Is anyone else out there having a bad day/week/month?” I don’t need to ask ~ I KNOW that answer. It’s like the lawyer and the trucker in the previous column, “Damn Straight!” What in the HELL is happening to us Folks? Are we all just walking around with peanuts in our pockets? God knows we are getting more than our share of squirrels. Large MUTANT GRADE Squirrels! EVERYONE is having a “GEE MR. CUSTER, THERE’S A FEW INJUNS OUT THERE!!!” Day ~ NOT just me. It’s so BAD I’m handing that Gallery Pic out as Flyers! 0;)  We’ve got Deputies citing the First Amendment in what they consider to be ‘Domestic Violence Cases’. This torques me off because apparently no matter how long ago it was or how hard it was to get or how much money you paid ~ Divorce Papers do NOT apply if the guy who is currently trying to off you AND your children was EVER married to you! About the most dignified answer I can come up with to that little pickle is, “Excuse me Sir, but if you know about the First Amendment I’m sure that the Penal Code was also included in what passed for your training. This is NOT Freedom of Speech. it’s Trespassing while making a Death Threat! Also, I have a slew of papers with a Judge’s signature on them that say this can’t be Domestic Violence since we are no longer Domestic and he can’t even see the kids because he’s an abuser and a lush ~ that would have been covered in the Civil Code. Did you miss Class that day?” The list of UNDIGNIFIED answers I came up with could fill the Yellow Pages.  But let’s hear it for the Constitution because it gets EVEN better! And Gods above and below know I would have bet the farm THAT wasn’t even remotely Possible. Now his Attorney says that the charges should be dropped because the ONLY reason the Deputies were there ON A PUBLIC ROAD in the first place was because…wait for it…”He had been having a discussion with his former wife and they would not have been there to arrest him when he left except for her telephone call!” You know the one she made because he was trying to break into her house and kill her and the 2-year-old! In other words it wasn’t a “Good Faith” bust AND…wait for it…THEY VIOLATED HIS CONSITUTIONAL RIGHTS! TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THERE IS NOT ENOUGH XANAX IN THE WORLD THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO REMAIN CALM DURING THAT ANNOUNCEMENT!  SIDEBAR: I’d LOVE to tell her to blow his violent, booze slurping and Death Threat making ass away the next time. And to make sure [this is IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROVES IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE] THAT his corpse fell INTO the house but for one thing. Do you know that in this Great Country of Ours a man can murder a woman or a child and all he will serve is an average of 7 YEARS!!! However, if you are an abused wife, daughter or girlfriend and something snaps causing you to remove your Torturer in a Permanent Way you are looking at 20 LARGE!!! BTW The man will do about 3 to 5 of it. The woman will do an average of 18 years! I should mention to my Male Readers that the 7 years ONLY applies to women and children ~ if you kill a MAN you will have committed a REAL CRIME and they hand out serious time for those!  Forget the Equal Rights Amendment! What I want is Hunting Permits and Hunting Season for Women. If you have to wait 30 days and endure a background check to shoot Bambi I think that at the VERY LEAST wives, mothers and female offspring deserve the same respect, don’t you? Oh and I want Designated Hunting Areas. That way we’d know to stay OUT of them. So if you get dead and you were in the Zone than we could say, “Well, I TOLD her it was Hunting Season and to stay OUT of the Woman Preserve but NO she just HAD to go there!” I’d also want the Federal Government to manage the Preserves just like they do National Parks. Instead of Murder the guy should get charged with Poaching or being out of Season or not having a Permit to Hunt. Why? Because those are Federal Crimes carrying a 15-year term in a Federal Penitentiary AND you will do the WHOLE stretch. If you killed an American Bald Eagle you better hope Johnnie Cochran is available because you could end up with The Needle for that bird! After all you violated a MAJOR LAW when you did it. As for my Female Readers ~ It beats the 7 Year/Out in 3-5 Penalty we have now doesn’t it! The LEAST he could do is fill out the paper work, pay the Licensing Fee and wait for the right month BEFORE he slaughters one of us!  Remember, I live in a Zero Tolerance State. That means that the Cops and NOT the Victim Press Charges. (Lord have mercy on those who don’t even have this imaginary Veil of Protection!) The Law was passed in an effort to get Abusers OUT of the Home without leaving it up to the Abusee. Because after the ijit makes Bail where is he going to go? Back Home to the person who just had him thrown in Jail! This was SO Not A Good Scenario! However, the Cops enforce the Law about as frequently as they enforce the one that involves Crossing Against the Light. So I figure if we’re going to be treated as Property we should get Property Penalties. Killing one of us should get the Perp as much time as robbing a 7-11 or jacking someone at an ATM WITHOUT VIOLENCE! Those are considered ‘Property Crimes’ and if you’re caught your face WILL show up on the 11 O’clock News! Fair is fair and at this point Victims of Abuse will take ANYTHING that gets the Offender out of their BarcaLounger and into a Prison Cell!  Here’s another Update: Some of the Cops involved in the Deadly Fruit Incident are going to be suspended WITHOUT pay while it’s being investigated! Like the man was holding them off with the fruit AND dressed up as Carmen Miranda (the original Dole Fruit Woman). God knows the first thing I worry about when someone is threatening to blow my ass up is that it might actually be with a piece of waxed fruit! But again, men killing another man merits attention from The Powers That Be! It turns out that the man was Mentally Ill at the time of the “Alleged Incident”, NOOOO! Ya think? I DO NOT feel that I am being presumptuous when I say for all of us, “Thanks! We had THAT part figured out. You’re not exactly ‘Steve Stable’ when you’re threatening to pull the pin off what turns out to be produce in front of the SWAT Team! But we appreciate The Media sharing the Incredibly Obvious with us!”  Naturally his family is suing because that’s the appropriate thing to do in this situation. They publicly state that the deceased had “…A history of Psychiatric Hospitalizations, delusionary episodes and violence…” Is it just me or does that mean that someone should have been keeping an eye on the guy? That this is not someone who should have been left home alone! But, again, NOOO! We’re going to have a bunch of Cops with PTSD because they had to put this poor bodach down as if he was a rabid dog and it’s THEIR FAULT he was wandering around unattended and unmedicated?  It looks as if his family missed that part of our CFO “Get Over It Day” whereby we agreed ”… from May 1st of 2004 we will each take responsibility for our actions…”  Nope, I feel safe in saying they NEVER read that part. Just do all of us a favor and make sure YOU read it BEFORE you move on to another page!  Keep the Faith!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever CABIN FEVER ONLINE

        Mood: IRONIC  Playing: BLACK 47: FUNKY CEILE (BRIDIE’S SONG)  Achairde All!  Yes, it’s Off The Chain Time again here at Cabin Fever Online. We make that decision whenever we’ve done a slew of columns and we need a change. LOL I’m using the Editorial WE! I know it’s time for a segue when I go to the bathroom to wash my face and I’ve got THAT look in my eyes. You know the one~ like THAT guy in the Platoon in a Viet Nam Movie who starts to get just a little TOO squirrelly. The one that has the other guys looking at each other and whispering, “Man, I don’t think Buzzard’s coming back this time! Did you see the look in his eyes? He’s been In Country just TOO frickin’ long Son!” I had THAT LOOK this morning. When you start laughing like Dracula’s sidekick and mumbling about bugs it’s time to get your mind on something else ~ FAST!  So, I decided to ponder the Nature of Absurdity. Basically, because it’s been a truly bizarre week or two. I’m warning you now. If you think that my sense of humor is a bit skewed you need to be elsewhere right about this sentence. It’s like that guy who opened his door to the Jehovah Witnesses after I warned him. Sorry about your luck! Or, Say it Loud Say it Proud, WARNING SHOT!  Did you know that in Florida you can get a ticket for DUI on a moped? (You can also get one on a bike but that’s not the story here.) If that isn’t absurd enough for you it’s what they DIDN’T bust him for that’s the issue. Though I must admit it went a long way in to helping it. Can you imagine being fingerprinted, mugshot and booked for that? You’d be in jail with all these convicted felons, gangbangers and politicians and they’d ask you what you were in for and you’d be stuck with IT. I can just see the other inmates:   “You got collared for DUI on a kiddy scooter? Get away from me man. No, I mean it! Go to the other side of the Yard before I hurt you! Stupidity could be contagious. In fact, you are so pathetic that I’m not even going to violate your sorry ass. Forget AIDS I could get DUMB! Go be someone else’s Bitch. I’ll take a Pass!”  That’s just SAD. But NO that wasn’t the real reason they busted him. He was drunk, pounding on his ex-wife’s front door and yelling that he was going to kill her AND the kids. She calls 911 and they tell her to stay in the house (THANKS She had that one covered!) and that the Deputy’s are on their way. Anyone remember my experience with Deputy Dawg? (See DRP 4.3: Zero Tolerance and Zero Assistance.) Well, guess what! He’s bbbaaaaaaaaaaaccckkk! And Hillsborough County has him. Either that or it’s his son in Deputy Dawg Reloaded!  I won’t go in to the intimate details but as I say long story short ~ they REFUSED to arrest him. On…wait for it…FIRST AMENDMENT GROUNDS! I kid you NOT! He’s her Ex-husband, he’s on HER property and he is threatening her life AND that of the children’s. He has no visitation because he’s an Abusive Alcoholic. We HAD to refer back to the Constitution to know how to handle it? We are not talking about a Pro-Choice or Gay Marriage Rally here. NOOOOO! It’s Trespassing at the least and Attempted Man 2 if we can get it! Hell, I’d settle for Drunk and Disorderly just to get the ijit off my porch and in the Holding Tank.  I guess ol’ Deputy Dawg must have figured that he had just said the 2nd Most Stupid Thing in the History of the World because once they ran him off they busted him. I imagine he’d figured out what you and I already know. That he’s going to leave, the guy’s going to go back and she’ll probably end up having to shoot him. Which means he’ll have to arrest the ex-wife for murder and that is NOT going to look good in his Jacket!  Absurdity A la Mode HAS got to be that this was the man’s…wait for it…5th DUI Bust! Which means an automatic 2 –3 years of hard time. I guess the Politician’s and the Police don’t care if it’s Hunting Season on Women but by God they won’t tolerate a Drunk Driver! Hell no, he might HURT someone! Is it any wonder I’m sitting here giggling like Renfield? Oh just shoot me now! Doesn’t it make you want to pull the wings off someone?  I like to be even handed in my sense of what will kill me before the Seizures and the Bad Heart do. So consider this little gem. Apparently, Florida is getting some bad press because the Police shot some guy who was holding them off by yelling that he had a grenade and that if they came any closer he would pull the pin. I don’t know all of the details but apparently this man was a bit older than the Cops were and they all sort of shot at him when he wouldn’t put it down. We’re still working on who actually off’d him because there were about 17 of them. Police Brutality to anyone? I don’t think so!  We’ve got enough tin in my family to export it to Oz! I know what was going through those officer’s minds. They didn’t want to shoot him. Contrary to popular belief your average Police Officer spends their life praying they will NEVER have to shoot someone. And not just because of the paper work, either. It’s a pretty horrific thing to have to kill someone. It’s not like they could go for the Good Wound here. If they shot at him and he didn’t die instantly he would have time to pull the pin. Then it’s several dead Cops and damage to a residential area. He was in the open so they couldn’t use tear gas. What in the Name of All that’s Holy were they supposed to do? Hope his hand got tired? Wait until he needed to take a bathroom break? Ask him if he wanted a cup of coffee and a cigarette?  Give me strength O Lord! Or as St. Teresa of Avila said, “Grant me patience Lord and please do it now!”  Turns out he was holding a piece of fruit. Which of course means we now have the 4th Estate analyzing it after the fact and questioning the Department’s Deadly Force Policy. I’d LOVE to be their Press Liaison for just 15 minutes. I’d hold a huge Press Conference, take that question and give them the answer the rest of us KNOW to be the right one.  “If you are standing in the middle of a subdivision ranting with a piece of fruit foreign or domestic, that is the same size, shape and color of a Hand Grenade and you threaten to pull the pin we WILL shoot you. Next question?”  Come on folks what are these reporters thinking? Its not like he was there with neon green Turbo-Blaster Squirt Gun! Anyone want to be his or her life on it? You think they should have considered THAT possibility? You’re in a stand-off for a couple of hours and you’re going to say, “I don’t know about it people. What if it’s just a Kiwi?” Kiwi THIS Nightline!  Now, I have had readers who wrote or commented to me that maybe it’s just because I live in the South. Again, NOOOO! Every region of this country has it’s own brand of Absurdity. The ONLY difference is that down here we WILL tell you about it. We will discuss it openly amongst ourselves. I promise you, there could be an African-American Attorney educated at Auburn and a Travis Tritt Trucker waiting at a crosswalk and before the light turned green the lawyer could turn to the trucker and say, “I’d have shot him.” And the trucker would come back with “Damn Straight!”  Because in the South we have a saying, “If you want to run with the Big Dogs you’ve got to come off the Porch.” Or, more appropriately, “IF you come off the Porch with a pear, say you have a Hand Grenade and threaten to pull the pin you will get Bit!”  Keep the Faith!

        Mood: SOMEWHERE, WAY BEYOND ANGER  Playing: MARILLION- SCRIPT FOR A JESTERS TEAR  Achairde All:  I know that most of you who have been reading my columns for awhile have seen me use the expression, “One toke over the line!” in my articles. It’s not meant to promote drug usage. Actually it’s a line from a song from the early 70s and the chorus is “One toke over the line Sweet Jesus, one toke over the line. Sitting downtown in a railway station, one toke over the line!” What the singer was saying was that there comes a point in life where things go too far and you have to make a choice to do to something about the situation. You all know that I think tomorrow is that day and here’s some information I hope will persuade you as well. I’d like to thank CBS News for the final bit of inspiration. Along with ‘GETTING OVER IT” I think it’s about time we let them and the rest of the so-called media know that we are not going to continue to allow them to improve their bottom line by making our tragedies. part of their quest for higher ratings.  I don’t think I have to prove my First Amendment Credentials to anyone. You’ve read what I’ve written, you’ve seen the links and you know that I very often write about things that the US Government would prefer I kept my damned mouth shut about. I’ve been doing it for years so I know the rules. I know where the boundaries are and that it’s damn hard to keep inside them when you are writing about Human Rights Violations. It’s important to tell the world about men, women and children being murdered or tortured or raped. However, in the back of your mind you have to keep the thought that they themselves, or their family members and those they left behind, are going to be reading or hearing about it as well!  Because I realize that every atrocity I’ve ever written about was done to someone’s child or sibling or friend. I have sat a my typewriter or computer with tears pouring down my face searching for euphemisms for what has been done to these people. I know that I have to write about it if I want it to end. If we don’t break the walls of secrecy then governments will continue to do it without fear of reprisal. Many of the reports I have read have made me sick and ALWAYS in the back of my mind was the question, “What if this was someone I knew? Would I want the whole world to know the graphic details of their suffering?  It’s up to me and people like you to get the message out while walking a fine line between information and sensationalism. If we become too numb from reading and writing about the victims than our own Humanity is in peril. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve just wanted to turn my back on it all and then stopped because someone HAS to speak for those who have no voice. I owe it to them. We ALL do because - they are part of our family known as the Human Race.  Back in the 80s I wrote a pamphlet about the misuse of Plastic Bullets by the English Government. It was based on a book entitled, “THEY SHOOT CHILDREN: The Use of Plastic Bullets In The North of Ireland” and on the cover is a picture of 12 year old Carol Ann Kelley in her coffin with facial damage even a mortician couldn’t cover. While I was doing the writing I was arguing with the President of our Chapter about using the photo. I wanted to use a picture of a plastic bullet. My argument was, “God Martin, if that was Jennifer (my youngest sister) I don’t know what I’d do. I’d want to HURT the insensitive bastard who used it.” But then he said, “Carol Ann’s parents allowed the use of the picture because they knew it was horrifying and they’re hoping it will shock enough people that the folks at Number 10 Downing Street will put an end to it. They don’t want other parents to have to bury their child for the same reason. They feel if it saves just one child then she didn’t die in vain.”  What kind of answer could I make to that? We used it and a copy of it is on my sidebar. I thought that if her father and mother could make such an incredible sacrifice then who was I to question it? I know that it did make a difference because they quit “Officially” using Plastic Bullets in the early 90s and a great deal of the credit goes to the Kelley Family. I have handed thousands of them out over the years, other Chapters across the US used them as well and I can tell you I have seen football players with necks bigger than my thigh with tears running down their faces as they read it.  In my April 23rd column I mentioned that I had read Daniel’s Autopsy report. I had read them before concerning Political Prisoners and their families. NOTHING on the face of this Earth will EVER prepare you to read one about someone you love. For the first year all I had to do was THINK about it being in an envelope in my desk to become hysterical. Try to imagine reading that about a member of YOUR family. The ONLY thing that was worse for me was knowing that Dan’s Mom had to read it as well. I think I cried as much for her as I did for myself. More, because Dan was her only son and her youngest. As bad as it was for me all I could think was that NO mother should have to read that about her child.   I am bringing all of this up because of what happened to me yesterday while I was reading the news at CBS.com. When I clicked on a link for world news I had my Real Player pop up and treat me to the details concerning their report on 48 Hours about the death of Princess Diana. I am not one to watch shows that tackle such subjects so I was a bit puzzled as to what the great controversy was over. Actually, I didn’t even know there was any sort of public outcry about it. Then, there it was, clips of what has got to be the most CRUEL, MERCENARY AND IRESPONSIBLE act of PSEUDO-JOURNALISM that I have ever witnessed in my entire life. They ACTUALLY SHOWED PHOTOS OF THIS WOMAN DYING with photographers hovering over her as if they were carrion crows waiting for the end of a battle.  I said to myself, “Holy Mother of God, what do they think they’re doing!” I couldn’t understand any reputable Editor approving the piece nor could I understand how it got past their Department of Standards and Practices and onto the Air. While this thought was running through my mind they switched to a man who had been at her Autopsy. As calmly and as dispassionately as one would discuss dissecting a frog in Biology Class he stated, “I was standing as close to the person who did the Postmortem as I am to you (the so-called Investigative Reporter) and I clearly heard him say, after he had separated the Womb and that there was no fetus. Diana was not pregnant.”  Well, thank you for THAT update you psychotic little creep and the image I’ll have to carry around for the rest of my life. I seldom get truly enraged but all I could think about was what her two sons were going to have deal in the aftermath of CBS’s attempt to boost their ratings. I wondered why there wasn’t ONE person at that ENTIRE Network who took a moment of time to consider what it was going to do to her boys. No one thought that they’d already suffered enough? They HAD to invent a Fresh Hell for them to inhabit!”  WHAT IN DAMNATION IS WRONG WITH US PEOPLE? WHEN DID WE DECIDE THAT THIS KIND OF JOURNALISM WAS GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE IN OUR SUPPOSEDLY CIVILIZED SOCIETY? Where were you and I when it happened? If they can show things like that can you imagine what they’re going to have to do to ‘top’ it I don’t even want to think about it! Is that the world we WANT to live in?  What has me so angry is that there was NO NEED for it. I suppose a case could be made for Conspiracy Theories and the Public’s right to know. However, there is no case to be made for the manner in which it was reported. CBS could have shown the car at a distance instead of a wide-angled close-up of her broken body. They could have edited it so that all we heard from Autopsy Boy was simply that the medical evidence showed that she was not pregnant at the time of her death. Forget she was a celebrity and think about your own mother and how you would react if it were her body in that car! Remember all the Forensic Files or other programs you’ve watched and take a moment to FEEL what your emotions would be when you heard the phrase, “When they separated her Womb…”  From PBS Online: Crucible of Empire- Historically the Spanish-American War is often referred to as the first "media war." During the 1890s, journalism that sensationalized—and sometimes even manufactured—dramati c events was a powerful force that helped propel the United States into war with Spain. Led by newspaper owners William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, journalism of the 1890s used melodrama, romance, and hyperbole to sell millions of newspapers--a style that became known as yellow journalism.   ALL that death and destruction just so they could sell more newspapers! Wake up folks! We now live in a 24/7 CNN, MSNBC, FNC channel world of Hearsts and Pulitzers. They are so desperate for information to fill up that time they will interview the guy who buffs the floors at the Pentagon at 2:00 am just to fill that void. They will knowingly use what used to be called ‘Incendiary Speech’ just to get that demographic jolt they crave. They don’t CARE that the manner in which they report the news helps raise global tensions. They WANT it to happen so they will have something to report on!  What I can’t begin to fathom is how they have the unmitigated gall to use our Constitution against us. They refuse to see that the First Amendment grants us Free Speech but along with that Freedom comes the responsibility to use that it wisely. It’s not just an issue of WHAT they report but HOW they report it. You can’t yell “Fire!” in a crowded theater. You shouldn’t enflame your audience just to make a lousy buck. May God forgive you if gain even a few Neilson points at the expense of a lifetime’s worth of pain for just ONE human being!  We, as the reading/viewing Public bear a certain amount of responsibility also. If we allow programs such as the one on Princess Diana to go by without standing up and telling the Media that we will not tolerate this sort of behavior then we have to shoulder some of the blame. Our silence on the matter will only serve as a tacit approval to CBS and other News Organizations. It also says that we do not care about two children in England who have to live with the death of their mother and her absence every day of their lives. Again, what sort of Society do we have, or will we have, if we allow this program to go unchallenged?  Below you will find the link to CBS’s Feedback Page. It’s a simple, fill in the blanks and leave a short comment form. It will take you all of 5 or 10 minutes to complete and it will send a vital message to those who presume to keep us informed. That’s all I am asking of you on behalf of the Dead and on the behalf of those they left behind. 10 minutes to show them that they can no longer justify their methods by saying, “This is what the public wants to see.”   CBS.COM FEEDBACK: http://www.cbsnews.c...k/fb_news_form.shtml  If you’re wandering what this has to do with our Inaugural May 1st “GET OVER IT DAY” consider this- there are hours of footage covering Wars but only a few that cover the Peace Talks.   At 12:01 am tonight I truly believe that it will be the time for us to change that around- before it’s too late for us all!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever CABIN FEVER ONLINE

        Mood: REFLECTIVE  Playing: DIDO- DON’T LEAVE HOME  Achairde All:  Well, that last column certainly generated a bit of mail and such. I want to thank everyone who took the time to read it. I especially want to thank everyone who also took the time to leave me a Comment, CB Post, Email, ICQ Message or ISM. I was truly touched by everyone’s concern and support. I want you to know that my life isn’t all brooding and seizures. Sometimes it’s brooding, seizures and massive pain. I’m joking, well not about the pain part, but my life isn’t all chaos and misery. I do have my good days as well. They are definitely more frequent since I became a member of ModBlog. 0;)  If you read the last column already you know I spoke about Discretion. I had an interesting discussion with a few friends about it. As you know, I am not one to pay any attention to someone’s age ~ young or old. I have friends that are 14 and friends that are 84. I either like someone or I don’t. Also, as I have said before, I was taught that it’s OK to get older as long as you don’t get OLD! However, these friends are in their early 20’s and we were talking about how there’s damn little subtlety or discretion left in the world. Especially in Music or other forms of Entertainment. I’d never really thought about it before but suddenly it hit me and I said, “You know, I actually feel sort of sorry for you guys. When I was growing up listening to the radio you knew there was 'Secret Code' to music as a way of getting around the censors. For instance you knew when Elton John was singing “Benny & The Jets” that it was about Speed. Or when you brought the "Frampton Comes Alive" album home you were shocked when you discovered it DIDN”T say, “I want to LOVE you.” Believe it or not it was really more enjoyable.”  I half expected them to tease me about being an old lady reminiscing about her youth. Imagine my surprise when they agreed with me! Now all of us listen to Alt so we’re not talking about a group of Brittany fans here. In fact, the joke is I’m the DJ for both apartments. I have a CD player in the living room but I write in my bedroom/office. I always write to music so I turn it up fairly loud. Since two of them live next door and their den shares a wall with my living room we both can hear it about the same volume. Luckily we also listen to the same music so it makes it more energy efficient. We run the gambit from Dido and Clannad to Dash Board Confessions to Anathema. I try not to let myself be ‘hobbled by foolish consistency”!  Everyone has their own ‘shock level’ but I think that most of us would agree that there is a limit to the number of words like “ho”, “bitch” or “nigger” that we need to hear in any given song much less in any given life time! And there are some words I won’t even listen to. This from a woman who dated the drummer in a Punk Band! Punk bands weren’t exactly noted for the delicacy of their language or subject matter. As raw as it could be it was still more about ideas and rebellion against being stifled by greed oriented society then stringing together as many foul words as possible. For example, Rat Cafeteria’s best-known song was “Tax Revolt” and was about Gordon Call. Don’t laugh, it actually did pretty well here and in Europe. When they opened for the Dead Kennedy's they had better audience response and reviews from Critics.  I watched the Comedy Channel’s 13th Anniversary with Snopp Dogg as the ‘musical guest’. I damn near had a seizure from all the beeps! It was like being back in the Neurology Lab at Tampa General Hospital. You want to know what bothered me? I could take the “F” word- what hacked me off was the line, “If you’re looking for my beep, it’s up your bitch’s beep!” I hate to be redundant but screw it- I’ d rather hear the flippin’ “F” word- it would have been less offensive!  Before you email or ISM me to tell me that I’m making a big deal out of nothing think about how powerfully music effects human emotions. Companies use it to sell products. People of all faiths use it praise and entreat Deities. Governments use it to promote Patriotism and in times of War or National Crisis. Think of all the songs and remixes we heard after 9-11. Remember how you FELTwhen you heard them. Music expresses things that we feel in a way that transcends words alone. Catholics have a saying, “Those who sing in the Choir pray twice.” That’s how important music is. When we forget that and allow ourselves to become indifferent to how inappropriate certain songs can be in specific situations we lose a part of our Humanity. We simply cease to care as much about what we say and what others say to us. One of the most powerful lines I have heard in a song dealt with people ‘tuning out’ other people by wearing personal music devices such as Walkman’s to live their lives to their own personal soundtracks instead of listening to the world around them. When the lead singer of Marillion sang, “Aural contraceptives aborting pregnant conversations” it made me sit straight up in my chair and ACTUALLY THINK of what I might be missing as I rode the Bus to work my ears covered with headphones and my eyes on a book.  Inventing words or changing what they mean in the context of a song is not only more creative, it’s a Hell of a lot more fun. Hip-Hop is a great example. It’s got a whole language of it’s own. It turns everyday words into something special. If you saw Queen Latifah and Steve Martin in “Bringing Down the House” you saw a prime example of how powerful music is as not only entertainment but as a way of communicating with each other one human being to another. Could Snoop have rapped with out the beeps and the denigrating women? Of course he could ~ the man has talent. Ask yourself what shocks you more. Someone being crude and offensive or someone who can still make you laugh or cry or think without them. If you’re honest with yourself I think he’d have shocked you more if he did a great song without them. You’d notice it. It would be, “Damn, Snoop did a whole song without being nasty or crude and I LIKED it!”  I’ve written about taking the 1st of May to spend sometime thinking about the world and how we can make it better by letting go of the past. In other words, “Get Over It!” Letting go means living in the present and you’re not going to do that very well if you are so shock proof that takes something the Emperor Caligula would have found excessive to get a reaction out of you! LOL  I have the CD from The House of Blues entitled “Essential Women” on it is a song where a woman sings, “If I can’t sell it, I’m sitting on it.” In the song she owns a furniture store. However, she knows and the audience knows that it’s one long double entendre. But at the end of it you’re laughing along with her. You’re part of the joke and what’s more is that she had to actually be creative to get her point across and you were part of that process. It’s a wonderful feeling.  Creativity and intelligence in entertainment. It’s a great concept, isn’t it? Let's hope it catches on!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever CABIN FEVER ONLINE

        Mood: SAD & FRAGILE  Playing: SEAL: KISS FROM A ROSE  Achairde All:  I really hadn’t planned on writing today, or even ‘til this weekend.. Basically because April 21st was the third anniversary of the day my Daniel died. He wasn’t ill, he wasn’t sick and he was four months shy of his 30th Birthday. We were best friends for fifteen years. So I hope you can understand that it’s not an anniversary that I do well. However, a couple of things changed my mind for me. One was that my new computer arrived and I had to go into transfer mode. Which meant I had to get up from the prone position where I was sobbing on our futon. Some women can cry gracefully ~ I am not one of them. After a couple of hours I look like Miss Piggy after 3-Day bender. After a week Wes Craven is calling me. My other reason is a new show on the Arts & Entertainment Network entitled, “Family Plot”. It is the latest in “Reality Shows” that takes place behind the scenes in a family run Funeral Home. The writers, producers and the participants in this little piece of “Hollywood Heaven” are obviously oblivious as to how inappropriate and painful their little Cinema Verite is to a large segment of the non-viewing audience. The commercial is unbelievably painful for someone who has gone through the death of a loved one.  I’ll leave the description of the inappropriate theme song, the laughter and crude remarks made by the operators until later. The thing that devastated me was the scene where the father (who is labeled as the ‘Body Remover’) is clumsily attempting to place a shrouded corpse in a coffin while one of his daughter’s harangues him about doing it incorrectly. She’s afraid that he’ll tip over the expensive coffin and damage it. The justification for the entire project is given by the son who is in charge, “Everyone always wants to know what goes on behind the scenes in mortuary.” Imagine my surprise! The entire country has been waiting for a chance to hear a woman complain about being, “...splashed with body fluids all day...”   I spent all those years in school and as an Advocate before I became disabled and then the past 13 ½ years learning to read, write and Advocate again. It never occurred to me that I really should have been spending my time worrying about what our local mortician was doing with his/her time! It’s no secret that I find so-called “Reality Programming” to be boring, degrading and a cheap way for a network to run a program where actors and writers have been dispensed with in favor of pathetic people sniffing after their 15 Minutes of Fame in much the same manner in which two dogs greet each other. (That’s a visual I’ll leave you to conjure up for yourself!) So what if the same person who has to make the pick up from the Dunkin’ Donuts every morning before work is the same person ‘suggesting’ plot twists to the vic-um-volunteers? People love it! Rigighhtt.  I am sure that if you have been reading me for awhile you know where I stand on Censorship and The Patriot Acts I and II. If you haven’t just take a look around at the links and pics and they should tell you something about my opinion. If you don’t like something on television that’s where the On/Off and Channel Changer come in. Which works well about 90% of the time. It’s when they bring in a third party that I get a bit off my game.  I remember thinking after my accident in December of 1990 that I was useless as a writer, much less an Advocate anymore. I couldn’t read or write. I had a short term memory of about five minutes and a whole host of other problems to deal with. Including the part where I would either lose consciousness ~ or flop around like a fish and then lose consciousness. It took almost two years of Cognitive Therapy to get skills that I had taken for granted for years back in an even marginal way. I didn’t even think about getting back into the fight ~ who’d want me? I couldn’t do protests, speak at Universities or be interviewed on radio or television because I couldn’t guarantee that I wouldn’t have a seizure in the middle of it. Also, I really didn’t see a future for me on the Net because every time I looked at a computer screen it was “Zoom City” after two minutes or so! (The key to that problem was to work up to a tolerance for staring at my Monitor.)  I remember the first time I had a hint that I could step out of my own personal Hell. We had a murder here in Tampa of the dismemberment variety. They kept finding parts of this poor bodach all over the Bay Area. I really wasn’t following along until the day they found his head. I was watching the News at Noon when they announced that they found it in Tampa Bay. The scene they were reporting this fact over was of the Examiner from the Coroner’s Office walking down the pier with what appeared to be a bowling bag. As for what was in it, as we used to say when I was a kid, “Three guesses and the first two don’t count!” (In other words it was pretty damn obvious what was in the bag!) All of the sudden I was furious. They were showing this poor man’s head being hauled off without regard to the fact that this was someone’s child, or brother or friend. They were so eager for the ratings coup that they didn’t care how painful that image was or the fact that it would stay with his loved ones for the rest of their lives.  The next thing I knew I was on the telephone, speaking to the News Director at the Station and asking him if had completely taken leave of his senses or his humanity. I remember asking him, what has come to be called ‘Mom’s Mantra” ~ “How would you feel if it was the head of your son or brother in that bag? News is one thing, cruelty is another!” Long story short, they did apologize for the piece but that didn’t undue the damage they had already done to the family. I’m not saying that they shouldn’t have reported the event, what I am saying is that when it involves a Third Party you have to exercise a bit of discretion. There is a difference between Censorship and Discretion. It’s not that Abstract a Concept. A good rule of thumb is, “If I am speaking for myself, or reporting on a situation when it involves a person or persons who aren’t Players (such as Politicians) it’s my job to make sure that I don’t make the situation worse for them.” Players are participants ~ innocent bystanders aren’t. It’s not that difficult a concept. In fact it’s a rule most of us remember from our childhoods. My Pagan friends boil it down to, “An it harm no one, do what ye will.” The emphasis is HARM NO ONE!  So there I am waiting for a documentary to start and I get treated to sixty seconds of life behind the curtain in a Funeral Home. The next thing I know I’m watching the Dad try to wrestle a body into a coffin like it was a piece of cord wood. It didn’t matter about the shroud because I (and the rest of the viewing public ) KNEW what was under it. Then I get the sisters discussing how one of them, as the chief embalmer, faints while she has blood drawn, but can handle other people’s bodily fluids being splashed on her all day. The other sister quips, “I wouldn’t mind ~ depending on the bodily fluid in question!” This is the cue for the first sister to screech at the camera operator, “Don’t you put that part in!” The scene ends with everyone giggling like pre-teens discussing the cutest boy in class.  Now, personally, I don’t care if someone wants to make an ass of themselves by competing for the affections of someone who may or may not have money, allowing themselves to be shut in a house with a cast of characters straight out of the DSMR IV while being taped 24/7 or even if they are doing a “Lord of The Flies” Redux while plotting against each other in a manner even Machiavelli would find excessive. They signed on for the gig and whatever happens they agreed to be there from the get go. However, this program is about dealing with remains of someone who didn’t plan on having their demise being used to boost ratings. There are damn few things left in this world that are treated with a sense of dignity and death is one of them. Or it used to be.  Anyone want to guess what this commercial did for me? Dan died of an undiagnosed heart condition. I had laid down because of a seizure and when I woke up I went looking for him. I found him in the bathroom, sitting slumped over on my bath bench and to this day I can not tell you why the words, “My God, he’s dead!” were the first things to go through my head. I do remember running in and pulling him upright. Running to get the telephone to call 911. I remember doing CPR until the EMTs pulled me off of him and said, “Ma’am you’ve got to stop. He’s been gone too long.” I remember having to call his parents and then have the Deputy refuse to let them in at first because our home was a “Crime Scene”. I will never forget that he was too tall for the gurney and they placed him in a body bag on the floor of the hall way with just his head showing. I have to live with the image of his parents and I kneeling on the floor next to his body to say good-bye. I remember his mother helping me to cut a lock of his hair. I remember how I felt when I had to read the Autopsy and going down the list of what his organs weighed. I live my life knowing that I had to help plan his funeral from a hospital bed but couldn’t attend because the day after he died I fell during a seizure, laid there for hours alone and paralyzed my right arm. Watching this man wrangle with a corpse brought all this crashing down on me in vivid color.  In the case of “Family Plot” I know what the people who loved the bodies of the ‘latest customer’ are going through because I went through it myself. Ask yourself if this sort of program is where you want to have your last memories of someone you love. Would it be funny if those were the bodies from 9-11? Is it appropriate to have someone singing cheerily in the background, “In the after-life you could be headed for some serious strife!” Even if every body they show is that of a Jane or John Doe they were still a part of our community. They were someone’s child or friend. When they died we all lost something because they were part of the family known as the Human Race. Consider this ~ the first Forensic’s programs did not show us the broken and battered bodies of the deceased. Now we not only get to view the Crime Scene photos we get to hear in minute detail how they were tortured and suffered until death came as a blessed relief. I haven’t bothered to watch since the first time I saw my first naked and mutilated body.  I realize that some of you are wondering why I chose this topic. It’s because I care about Human Rights and I am afraid that we are becoming so used to dead bodies that the victim has become nothing but a plot device. Look at your local television guide. Every network has it’s own version of CSI. If you have cable or satellite you can literally spend your entire evening watching the aftermath of murder by simply switching from Court TV to A&E to Discovery. There was a time, in our very recent past, when a picture of raped and mutilated body being shown would have brought thousands of calls to a Network condemning them for showing such a thing. Now we have become, as one song suggests, “Comfortably Numb”. It’s hard to get people to care about Political Prisoners anymore unless they were tortured in some new and horribly inventive way.  I used to like books by people like Ann Rule and her ilk. The genre is known as “True Crime Novels”. Then I read “Beauty” by Sherri S. Tepper. In it her main character visits an updated version of Dante’s Inferno. What jolted me out of my fascination for such books was the fact that there was one Ring reserved for such authors and the producer’s of what have become know as “Slasher Flicks”. The reason they were in Hell is because they contributed to the end of our society being appalled at horror and senseless violence. The idea hit me like a ton of bricks because I realized that I had just finished reading about a woman murdering her children in much the same way I would read any other Mystery Novel. That was the day I trashed what I have come to call “Voyeur Reality”. When I read about someone being tortured for being a Political Dissident I WANT to be sickened by it because that is what motivates me to take steps to put an end to such things.   I realize that the program in question was filmed months ago and is already ‘in the can’. There’s nothing I can do but refuse to watch it, email A&E to let them know that I feel they’ve crossed the line with it and notify the companies that advertise during it that I won’t be using their products in the future. What I am trying to do here is to ask everyone who reads this to reflect on their own ‘Reality Level’ and ask if you’ve become ‘comfortably numb’. God knows I hope that the answer to that is a resounding “NO” not only for your own sake but for the sake of those who count on us to be there when a Government steps over that line in the sand. When we lose the ability to be shocked we also lose the ability to care. Is that what we call Entertainment?  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever CABIN FEVER ONLINE

        Mood: VERY DON QUIXOTE  Playing: JEWEL: HANDS  Achairde All!  Well, I guess I've really touched a nerve or several thousand! I have either conceived of a way to unite people or I am a danger to minors and other well-meaning folk. I don't know how many email replies I've sent but I've decided to move the disagreement out in the open instead of in the Comments or my Outlook Express. They all said basically the SAME thing: Thesis chara ~ LOOK at the Thesis. I never said that anyone was innocent. I never even said that we should forget the Past as some have suggested. What I DID purpose is that if we stay so emotionally invested in the Past we are never going to have a chance for a Future ~ much less a happy one. That what I envision will at least give us the HOPE that our entire planet can be a Garden and not a Battlefield.  "Get Over It Day" is a time to realize that we ALL, at some point in History, have experienced Religious, Racial, Gender, Nationalist or Ideological Persecutions. Then decide that we are NOT going to be Guest Victims at the Pity Party anymore. That from May 1st of 2004 we will each take responsibility for our actions. That such actions may involve giving up our Personal Martyrdom and putting aside our Hatreds. No matter how well deserved those hatreds might be because holding on to them is what fuels Turnabout.   I cannot think of one positive reason for Turnabout, can you? Committing atrocities because they were done to you or yours in the past or present is a very poor excuse in my book. Also, I believe that I was very open about the fact that it may take years for the idea to catch on. However, I was also very open about the fact that if we don't start something now we are all going to end up with a serious Case of Dead. If not us, certainly our children.  The other idea I included in "Get Over It" was we cease to Color Code, Engender or Regionalize Human Rights. Persecution can and should be fought but I do not believe that one race or religion or sex should be either be singled out for or denied assistance. In other words, our Humanity should include ALL Humans.  Another thing people assumed from my writing was that I am against ALL war. Someday, I hope to be. In fact, I hope we all will be. Realistically I know that as long as there are people blowing each other up, feeding their citizens into a woodchipper feet first or torturing Political Dissidents we are going to have to defend ourselves. Sometimes we will even need to go out of our own countries to help others ~ if only to persuade Aggressors that gassing entire villages of their countrymen is not something we will tolerate happening on this Planet. Eddie Izzard, the actor/comedian once remarked that we are accepting of Dictators who murder millions of people as long as they do it within their own Borders. That might have been true in the last century but it won't work for this one. Anyone who regularly uses the Internet or watches Television knows that we are too 'wired together' to idly stand by when satellites can give us close ups of the dead and bring their bodies into our living rooms or laptops 24/7. The Days of NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) are gone because NOW the entire World is Our Backyard.  I hope that this explains the reasoning behind my Article. If anyone knows of a case of Turnabout that HAS made the world a better place I am willing to listen. I do not think there is one, hence the reference to Tic-Tac-Toe. Once we grasp the reasoning behind Turnabout I think everyone will agree with me that it is not a game anyone will ever win and may very well destroy the very things we fight for and cherish.

        Mood: CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC  Playing: FUEL: QUARTER  There is nothing like being stuck in bed to give you a chance to think about things. One of my biggest problems is that I have ‘too many thoughts’. Now, that doesn’t just mean that I think of a lot of different things, which I do. It also means that I think too many thoughts about EVERY individual thought or idea. Before the Brain Damage, the Abuse, the Loss and the ‘forty-‘leven’ Brushes with Death I WAS GREAT at multi-tasking. Now a wonderful multi-task experience involves being able to write, type, listen to music and not blow up the can of Diet Coke I put in the freezer to chill because I forgot about it. Also, I DO NOT DO APRILS WELL. No excuses, Daniel died on April 21st, 2001 and the first thing I did after the Parents, the Deputies and the EMTs was to seize out and paralyze my right arm. My right hand was clenched in a fist for almost a year. Which, is not without a certain sense of irony, given I have NEVER been that angry in my life. I’m still angry. I pray I won’t die angry but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. I, however, WILL keep trying.  The past week has given me a chance to read, watch an embarrassing amount of TV/DVDs and come to a fairly Cosmic Revelation. Too much of life and history is based on the childhood expression; “Turnabout is Fair Play”. It effects Lives, Human Rights and Governments LONG after childhood should have ended. This is not the same as Karma because Karma implies growth. Turnabout is about repeating the same sad mistakes over and over again, never learning and perpetrating the same old set of atrocities because someone did them to you and yours in the Past. It also means developing the ability to lie to yourself in a truly frightening manner. Turnabout has even been enshrined in our New Global Identity as a slogan, straight out of Madison Avenue and about as palatable, slapped on our Bumpers reading, “PAYBACK’S A BITCH!’ Turnabout keeps us from moving on and from making this planet a Garden instead of a Battlefield.  I am not good at Turnabout. I never was. Probably because I draw my own identity from two Peoples who somehow missed out on the Concept. Also because both are very big into self-examination and being honest with yourself. I think this is the reason the whole idea escaped my attention for 44 years. Also, the one admonishment I remember best was that my own mother always wanted us to see things from the ‘other side’, so to speak. If Mom had a mantra it would be, “How would YOU like it if SOMEONE did that to you?” If I could elect ANYONE it would be my mom because she’s very good at explaining the complex in simple, realistic terms. That and a LOOK that could shame Osama into understanding that Turnabout is NOT the actions of an Freedom Fighter but those of someone searching for Power and Self-Vindication over the Bodies of Innocents.  Anyone feel that I’m boiling the complex down to the simple? It’s because Complex is a relative term. Usually involving turning something that could be worked out by a good Playground Monitor into a nightmare of death, destruction and ENDLESS rounds of meetings, summits and Peace Talks. This was another concept that went :::WHOOSH::: right on by me until I realized that somewhere along the way “Simple” became synonymous with “Stupid” and “Complex” with “Important”. Important people have Power and that’s what everyone craves, right? Wrong. Again, Power is not growth anymore than Turnabout is. The ONLY thing they do have in common is that both are examples of making people feel good about themselves WITHOUT requiring that they actually commit ONE USEFUL SELFLESS act in their ENTIRE LIVES.  Before you dismiss me out of hand please allow me to give you a few real world examples. Everyone knows what the phrase ‘Concentration Camp’ means don’t they? Do you know when it first came into use? I am willing to bet that Germany, Hitler’s Final Solution and Jews were the first words that came to mind. Keep them there- you will need them later. However, I hate to insert a little truth into such a long-standing belief but the British invented the camps and the term for them. Concentration Camps in which Britain killed 27,000 Boer women and 24,000 children during the what has come to be known as the Boer War (c. 1899-1902) You see English domination of the Dutch descendants (known as Boers or Afrikaners) resulted in the Dutch establishing the new colonies of Orange Free State and Transvaal. The English went along with this until someone discovered DIAMONDS in these lands around 1900. This ended their indifference. Those diamonds were THEIRS! After fighting for awhile without any noticeable success the British Army and the Home Secretary fell back on a battle plan that had worked well in the past. Round up the women and children then drive them off their lands, burn their farmsteads and slaughter hundreds of thousands of cattle, sheep and other livestock in front of them. It’s an old trick meant to demoralize their opponents. When the men would not give up they halved the already starvation level rations with the result that MORE CHILDREN DIED OF HUNGER THEN MEN FIGHTING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR. Historians differ as to whether the term was first used in 1901 or 1902 but they all agree about the Atrocities and the Dying.  Now one thing the English Government, be it Monarchy or Parliamentary, is really good at is an almost pathological willingness to do ANYTHING HORRIFC as long as it gets them what they feel to be theirs by right of need or conquest. In the nineteenth century, Chinese green tea became very popular among Europeans and Americans. Chinese silk and porcelain were also in great demand. The Chinese, on the other hand, needed almost nothing the West had to offer. This created an imbalance of trade, especially bad for the British, who were tired of sending tons of silver to Hong Kong to actually PAY for what they wanted. Their method of correcting their Trade Deficit was to start another ‘Golden Triangle’ (much like the America/Jamaica/Afri ca Triangle they created to obtain raw materials, sell rum and import slaves to eliminate a work force shortage and for their re-sale value.) Their solution was to trade their own merchandise in India and Southeast Asia for cotton and opium then send them to China to complete the Trading Circuit. This was done in spite of the Imperial Chinese prohibition on opium use. In the early 1800s opium addiction reached epidemic proportions in China after the British began using IT instead of money. So, the Emperor stepped in with a ‘Just Say No Program’ of his own. The only reason that it was effective was because the rest of HIS slogan was, “Or You’ll Be Summarily Executed!” The British reaction to the Prohibition was to retaliate violently, soundly defeating the unprepared Chinese, and forcing them to sign the first of what the Chinese dubbed the 'unequal treaties'. This is when Hong Kong became a British territory. England was given 'most-favored-natio n' status, and British nationals were exempt from Chinese law. This 'little exception' allowed them to legally sell Opium. Nice work if you can get it! China also was forced to pay a large sum of money. Why, because they wanted that Tea and Hong Kong with it’s Trade Routes, Seaports and Natural Resources. This is Severely Twisted Turnabout because later the British would blame the ‘decadent Chinese’ for so many of their aristocracy, artists and politicians becoming addicted to Opium!  The term “Plantation” is another British invention. They couldn’t grow enough food on their own lands and the added seaports were needed to help make their Navy the most powerful in the world. The same Navy they built The Empire on. That’s when Ireland became England’s ‘plantation’ and was even called The Plantation by their Monarchs and Oliver “To Hell or Connacht “ Cromwell for centuries. The only reason they kept the Six Counties is that Belfast is an exceptional deep-water port and it gives them an additional claim to the North Sea Oil. FORCING people to emigrate from Scotland under military escort gerrymandered the so-called Protestant Majority. It has been speculated that the so-called Loyalists determination to remain in Ulster and part of the United Kingdom comes from their fear of being landless once again. A fear that has turned to violence not only against Nationalists but against the British Army now that England can no longer justify it’s occupation of Ireland to the world or it’s cost to the citizens of the United Kingdom and plans to (eventually- or so they say) pull out.  Now this is not, despite the above, a diatribe against the British. (Though I am the first to admit that I am distinctly UNFOND of their government!) It’s about Turnabout. Remember the Boers? These are the same people who brought us, in the 1940s---APARTHEID, which was modeled after English Penal Law in Ireland! Townships (Concentration Camps), Racial Laws and a Military whose favorite maneuver was rounding people up for a little chat and a lot of torture. Turnabout! And “Irony At It’s Finest” has GOT to be that after ‘sharing’ power for a few years the hunters are now the hunted. Their properties and bank accounts are being ‘liberated’ along with the ever-popular midnight raids now taking place on THEIR families. Newspapers, television and radio stations using the Afrikaner Language have been banned and confiscated. They are now the Persecuted Minority. Turnabout Redux!  Remember China, Hong Kong and The Opium wars? The British returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese in 1997 as part of their Treaty. If you were lucky you got your family and your money out of there before the Great Return. If you worked for the Brits- and let’s face it, what other choice did these people have, when they were running the Colony, life got decidedly dicey after Der Tag. If you were any sort of petty official, police officer or teacher WITHOUT the funds to get the ‘Hell Out of Dodge’ then, despite the Documentaries, your life is worth about 10 Cents. Because there is a very good chance that you are in a Camp on the Mainland making things that will be on sale at J.C. Penney’s this weekend. Of course you receive 10 Cents a day, a bowl of rice and all the Mao they can read to you during your 16-hour shift. You can Google ‘til your fingers drop but it will take you about 2 hours of intense web searches and more links than the PGA and LPGA have combined to get to the truth. Since it’s only been 7 years this is Warp-Speed Turnabout!  I told you to remember the Jews and the reason was that they have got to be the “For All Time Universal Champions at Turnabout”. Now, you would think that any culture that went through the Final Solution would be at least a little reluctant to take on the mantle of their oppressors, wouldn’t you? Dream on! Not only are they great at life imitating art they don’t even bother with propaganda to make it at least appear that they aren’t doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to them. I’ve tried to come up with a marginally more intellectual term for it but there just isn’t one- this should be known as “The Bite Me School of Turnabout”. Sorry if that seems a bit blunt but what else do you call ‘Resettlement Camps’, building settlements where you signed a treaty not to, a “Shoot to Kill Policy” and their newest trip down memory lane- The Wall. (Oddly enough there was a mini-series with that title that dealt with the Warsaw Ghetto!) I remember that at one point they decided to make Palestinians who worked in Jewish areas wear identity cards clipped to their clothes. It so outraged an Israeli citizen that he took the Star his father was forced to wear before they gassed him and wore it pinned to his shirt as he made his deliveries. Once he showed up on American television the policy was phased out. They did adopt the “Heavy Machinery for Peace Program” this means that if they THINK you might support Palestinian Terrorism they will come to your home, force everyone to leave in whatever they’re standing up in and then BULLDOZE YOUR HOUSE TO THE GROUND. I guess when you have the keys little things like evidence and trials must seem like a foolish waste of time. Whenever they are called on something the Israeli Government blames it on Jewish Fundamentalist Organizations- now doesn’t that sound familiar? It will if you substitute the word Muslim. Moderate Muslim governments say the same thing when their citizens travel the world bombing innocent people like they booked an excursion trip to Hades. The entire Middle East is playing a form of Turnabout you need a Playbook AND a Scorekeeper to keep track of!  Now, many words ago I admitted that I am not good at this Game and it is probably the result of being raised in two cultures that just don’t play it. When the Irish established the Republic they didn’t run around burning down peoples homes or lining them up against the wall and shooting them. Now, it might be because some of the greatest Irish Nationalist Leaders were Protestants of Anglo descent. Just blew that, “It’s a Religious War Propaganda” the Brits and the American Government have been feeding you all to Hell didn’t it! My personal hero in this category is Charles Parnell Stewart also known as “The Blackbird of Avondale”. Since even saying the name of convicted Nationalists could get you convicted as well the Irish took euphemisms to new and dizzying heights. The “Lark on the Barbed Wire” represents those who languished or are STILL languishing in British prisons or Camps such as The Maze (or Long Kesh) in the North of Ireland.  The Cherokee Nation does not, nor any other Native American Tribe that I am aware of, advocate overthrowing the American Government. We don’t run around planting bombs or hoarding weapons Mass Destruction. As a member of AIM all we’ve ever wanted was our Civil Rights, the BIA to get out of the Rez Management Field and for a few clauses of the numerous Treaties that were signed to actually be upheld. We’d also like the US Government to quit ‘Eminent Domaining’ every wasteland they’ve ever ‘given us’ whenever they think they’ve found Oil or Uranium on it! Also, if it isn’t too much to ask after all the GENOCIDE COULD WE PLEASE LOSE CHIEF WAHOO AND THE REST OF THE ‘LOVABLE STEROTYPES? They banned “Huckleberry Finn” yet the NFL Franchise in our Nation’s Capital is STILL KNOWN AS ‘THE REDSKINS’! Time to even up that playing field, pardon the pun! ALSO, we'd like Leonard Peltier back. It's sort of hard to 'murder' someone if you weren't EVEN IN THE SAME STATE at the time! Thank you.  The Supreme Piece of Irony in all of this is that the AIM and every Irish American Organization that advocates Re-Unification is on the damn ‘DOMESTIC TERRORIST LIST’. I guess the comparative of Turnabout is Screwed Over!  Despite ALL this I DO have an idea on how we might all put May 1st or May Day to good use on an International Scale. Since it’s the People’s Holiday I suggest the People take the day to reflect on the past, look toward the future and GET OVER IT! Whatever happened before May 1st, 2004- whatever Hell your PERSONAL Religion/Culture/Cou ntry has been through it is time to MOVE ON FOLKS! It’s time to realize that no matter what has happened to you in the Past there comes a day when everything YOU DO until the day you die is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. We are still trying to get Batterers or Pedophiles or other Violent Criminals to comprehend that just because it happened to you DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO DO IT TO OTHERS. At what point does what you do become your CHOICE and not because of your Parents, Teachers or Socio-Economic Group? If we can’t take responsibility individually how will we ever have responsible governments?   I don’t expect it to take just one May 1st but I do think it’s a start. Anyone who has ever seen the movie “War Games” knows that they averted Nuclear Annihilation by teaching the Computer how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. In fact at one point one character asks another why children stop playing the game after a certain age. Her answer was, “Because it’s a stupid kid’s game. Nobody ever wins and it’s always a tie.”  Sounds like Turnabout to me!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever CABIN FEVER ONLINE

        Mood: VERY DISILLUSIONED  Playing: THAT PETROL EMOTION: BIG DECISION  HE ALREADY HAS MORE THAN ONE GOLDEN CABIN AWARD BUT THE BEST COMMENT ON THIS ARTICLE BELONGS TO:  Posted by: billysblog Date: 4/3/04 at 2:52PM (1d2h ago)   I always presumed that we couldn't fish because the landlords owned the waters, and would shoot you for poaching.  But what do I know?  Bill   REPLY:  Posted by: CabinFever  Date: 4/4/04 at 12:03PM (5h42m)   GOOD FOR YOU CHARA! Now if we could only persuade NBC and the rest of the world. Lord knows I've tried.  You couldn't fish, hunt or shoot 'game birds' under Penalty of Death OR Transportation to a Penal Colony. Our neighbors to the North who think I'm harsh on the Brits should also be aware that the Irish were offered an entire Canadian Province of their own if they would just leave. Not trusting them the Catholic Church in Ireland declined the offer.  As for what you know, I don't know what other people call it, but around my house it's known as the Truth.  It can be a real Bitch!  Slan, Elaine/cf   I try to keep some symmetry in my articles but every once in awhile you have to chuck it and deal with the matters at hand. I did not call anyone a bigot. I said that the remark was bigoted. It’s like the difference between dumb and stupid. People can say some really hurtful things without being aware that they said something wrong. It happened to me as you all know. For anyone who doesn’t want to look for the previous article the event in question took place like this:  The first day of busing in Maryland there was a kid behind me poking me in the back with a pencil, over and over again, saying, “Hey Girl!” Now, having spent most of my years in Parochial School I was raised with this funny idea that you actually LISTENED AND KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT WHEN A TEACHER WAS SPEAKING, so I ignored it. This went on for about 15 minutes until he went ‘one poke over the line’ and I turned and said, “Hey Boy, do you think you could keep your pencil to yourself!”  :::WHOOSH::: Next thing, I who had NEVER been in trouble, was in the Vice-Principal’s Office. I was terrified and very confused. I HAD NEVER BEEN SENT TO THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE! I didn’t poke anyone with a pencil. I just asked him to stop and I didn’t even use any four-letter words. Now our school VP had wicked rep that was well deserved. He was just beginning his lecture when I asked, “Sir, what exactly did I do wrong here? Why isn’t the guy with the pencil here?”  “Because you used a racial slur,” he replied.  I was so shocked I said, “No Sir, I did not and anyone who says I did is a liar!”  He gave me this really odd look and very gently asked me, “Elaine, did you say the word ‘boy’?”  “Well yes, but he was calling me Hey Girl so I said Hey Boy!”  Still being unusually kind he said, “Elaine, ‘boy’ is a racist remark.”  I looked at the man like he had just said the most idiotic thing in the world and my Nice Catholic Girl Self replied, “WHO told you that! That is the dumbest thing I’ve heard in my life. I went to school in Ancostia in D.C. and no one ever told me that. I was the minority there and people said boy all the time!”  I guess he figured out I was really upset and was being truthful. I got a 20-minute history of the word. I was appalled. He called the other kid in along with the teacher and explained I truly was unaware of being offensive. When he got to the part about me going to St. Teresa’s in Ancostia the guy laughed and said, “I believe her. If she was a racist she’d have been a dead racist before this.”  When I got home and started to ream my Mom out about her not telling me that ‘boy’ was a bad word and she just gave me one look. Then she said, “Your father and I did not think that was something you needed to know.” End of Discussion.  However, ‘let the debauchery begin’ goes WAY over the top of not knowing a common word can be used two ways. Do I think it was done intentionally- NO! Do I think it was incredibly offensive? Hell YES!  St. Patrick’s Day in the Republic of Ireland is a National Holiday. It is a day when people celebrate the life of St. Patrick and Christianity. After hundreds of years of oppression, slavery and murder because under the English celebrating St. Patrick’s Day was a crime that would get you hung it has become an affirmation of being Irish. For almost a millennia our Faith, our Language and our Traditions were considered crimes. The only reason the Irish language survived at all was that men and women risked their lives to pass it on in ‘classrooms’ under the hedges that lined the fields to teach it. They were called Hedge-Masters and if they didn’t hang you they sold you off to Trading Companies in places like Australia and America. Oliver Cromwell sent 40,000 men and women to what is now Louisianna and they did not go as tourists. They were sold.  Pretty much everyone who ever went to a St. Patrick’s Day Party has heard of the very sad Irish song, “The Wearin’ O The Green”. Most non-Irish people don’t know the words or the fact that the line, “And they’re hanging men and women for the wearin’ of the Green!” IS NOT POETIC LICENSE IT IS THE TRUTH- WEARING GREEN WAS A CRIME! In the Falls Road sections of Belfast or in Derry boozed up men terrorize Catholics and vandalize their homes and businesses and it NEVER makes the news in the United States. Imagine the Nazi’s Night of Broken Glass every year for almost a hundred years and welcome to the North of Ireland! Don’t call the Ulster Police because they are too busy participating. It happened this year. Did you read about it? See it on TV? NO!  Do some Irish celebrations in New York or Chicago or even Tampa get a little rowdy. Yes they do. But we don’t do wet Green T-shirt contests and we don’t vote on which man or woman has the sexiest green underwear. I, along with many Irish Americans won’t go in a Bennigans to save our lives. Sure we drink. We also don’t drink. However we do sing and dance and laugh and cry because that is our way. Protestant ministers in this country used to give Sermons against the Irish and St. Patrick’s Day calling it, “The Devil’s Holiday”. Now it’s just a way to make a fast buck off of people who need another Holiday to get drunk and act like jerks. Besides, you only have to be ‘Irish’ that day and not the other 364.  The other 364 means we call the so-called Potato Famine, “An Gorta Mór”. “The Great Hunger or Starvation” because it also occurred in other countries such as France but you didn’t see a mass exodus of those people. Why, because their governments know you don’t EXPORT FOOD WHILE PEOPLE ARE STARVING. It wasn’t a famine- it was GENOCIDE.  From http://www.geocities...innelass/hunger.html - An Gorta Mor-The Irish Holocaust:  “For those who wish to avail themselves of the facts regarding An Gorta Mór, the Great Starvation that occurred in Ireland during the years 1845-1850, I provide these resources. A condemnation of England's behavior during the years of 1845-50 in Ireland is justified and well documented. It amazes me that there are people today who would have you believe that the potato blight and the ensuing carnage was a 'natural' disaster. I suppose these are the same people who would emphatically declare that the Jewish Holocaust never occurred....Beware historical revisionists who will try to convince you that this was a 'natural' disaster.   Consider: This potato blight occurred in other European nations at the very same time it occurred in Ireland; yet Ireland was the only country where millions died or were forced to emigrate; It was not the blight that killed millions, but the system imposed by the British government on the native Irish that caused this genocide; The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines 'genocide' as "the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group" ~ this is certainly what occurred in Ireland during 1845-1850.  Under the British system of rule, Irish Catholics were forced to hand over the crops they grew as payment of their rent to the English landlords; they were permitted to keep only their potato crop. When the blight occurred, they were given two impossible choices: keep their edible crops to feed their families (in which case they were forcibly evicted and faced certain death) or turn over their edible crops to the landlord and die of starvation - what would YOU have done? And....if you were caught for the petty theft of a chicken or fish from the Landlord's waters, you were sentenced to life and transported to Van Dieman's Land.  Prime Minister Tony Blair finally acknowledged England's culpability when he stated "Those who governed in London at the time failed their people through standing by while a crop failure turned into a massive human tragedy. We must not forget such a dreadful event."  Were it not for this avoidable tragedy, many descendants of the An Gorta Mór Diaspora would still reside in Ireland today.”  *****What can you say to that? Still want to Party? Are you still up for a little ‘debauchery’?*****  I’ll close with the last words I used in a Guest Column I did on the subject of St. Patrick’s Day:  “Now that you’re ready, realize that to be a true Irish-American is to watch the world selectively applaud freedom and self-determination based on what is politically expedient. It is to know that we have one more wall to go, and to take up the cause of tearing down that wall despite anger, tears and frustration 365 days a year.”   Beannachtai na Feile Padraig agat!

Hinchey President, Emeritus Irish-American Unity Conference Florida West Coast Region  FYI: THE FIRST EPISODE OF HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS HAD THE CHARACTER OF DETECTIVE MUNCH (NOW ON LAW & ORDER SVU) SAYING TO HIS IRISH AMERICAN PARTNER-  "...POTATO FAMINE?

        Mood: DISILLUSIONED  Playing: SARAH MCLACHLAN: PRAYER OF ST. FRANCIS  Achairde All:  I ALMOST MADE IT! I CAME SO CLOSE TO GETTING PAST ST. PATRICK'S DAY WITHOUT GETTING SO ANGRY I'LL BE SAYING HAIL MARY'S NON-STOP FOR THE NEXT MONTH! BUT NO.....  SOMEONE JUST HAD TO GO THERE. THE EXACT WORDS WERE:  "And it's St. Pattys day, so let the debauchery begin."  Gee, I just can't thank them enough for perpetuating that American Stereotype- we don't even celebrate St. Patrick's Day publically in my house. In fact, if any of you have a fax I will send you the Guest Column complete with artwork by Don Addis I did for a major newspaper on the Subject. FYI Patty/Paddy is what the Brits use instead of nigger. I found that out- the hard way, from a couple of dozen Sailors off the HMS Who-Gives-A-Damn who were determined to beat the shit out of me for holding up a sign that said, "ENGLAND OUT OF IRELAND." The only thing that saved me from a severe case of 'whup-ass' was I made the OD (Officer of the Day) laugh when I dropped the sign, pointed to one sailor with really bad jams on (not that there were ever GOOD jams) and yelled, "Hey Dude, you want to turn those pants UP some? I CAN'T HEAR THEM!"  And that was ALMOST as much fun as the time some idiot called Dan and I AN EQUALLY OFFENSIVE TERM. Apparently the guy was from a State without a lot of African Americans but DID HAVE a Rez or two. His exact words, "I move all they way down here and what do I meet the first night I go out...GAWD DAMNED PRAIRIE NIGGERS!"  In my ignorance after 9-11 I thought ALL PREDJUDICE (EXCEPT THAT AGAINST LOUD CLOTHING) WAS OVER. It didn't matter your skin color, religion or ethnicity, ALL THEY WERE GUNNING FOR ON THAT DAY WERE AMERICANS. I guess that just proves I have Brain Damage!  But you know what, I'd rather have that than LACK OF HEART DAMAGE. So unless you people think bigotry is FUN and that next Dr. Martin Luther King Day we should all chow down on some fried chicken and watermelon or Columbus Day should be a day for a 'Soprano's Marathon' and an All-You-Can Eat Spaghetti Bar can we quit breaking out words like Debauchery on what is a HOLY DAY IN IRELAND AND TO INFORMED IRISH AMERICANS. WE DON'T DRINK GUINESS WE GO TO MASS!  Anglo-Irish slavery and apartheid is over 800 years old. Still feel like a party to you?  Beannachtai na Feile Padraig agat!

        Mood: LIVID  Playing: THE CLASH: KNOW YOUR RIGHTS  Achairde All:  As you know I beginning a series about the Patriot Act. Since I write online and you are reading it on the Net I thought I’d explore the fact that much of the TPA focuses on the use of Computers. The Electronic Frontier Foundation even suggests that you be careful what you search for on Google! I am, obviously, a foregone conclusion since I’ve used Key Words such as; AIM, Cherokee, Gaelige, Irish, IRA, Leonard Peltier, Native American, Northern Ireland, Wounded Knee and the United Nations Charter and it’s Articles. (Don’t tell me about user names and aliases because I know how they get past all that. Hell’s Bells, the American Library Association knows it too. That’s why they filed an Amicus Brief because a lot of people access the Net from their local Library because they can’t afford it at home.) Besides I had one Uncle and three Uncles-In-Law that were stationed at Ft. Meade in Maryland. Nevermind, the people who monitor us know what that means. What it means to me is that I do my work openly, I am up front about my Vitals (Pity the poor bodach who tries to ID Theft me!) and I NEVER lie to the FBI.  That last part has nothing to do with me being Heroic. It has to do with the fact that if you screw up (or in my case practice Democracy with Intent) the thing that will get you in really deep bull-muffins is lying about it. This is not an opinion it is a Historical Fact and a very important one- which is probably why my Dad taught us the only answer to someone trying to Blackmail you is, “Go ahead.” Just make sure you get to the person or the Press BEFORE whoever threatens you does! Richard Nixon didn’t do anything wrong except lie to protect his friends. He was winning the freakin’ election and he certainly didn’t suggest a group of idiots break-in to the Watergate. If he’d pulled a Clinton and told them, “Sorry about your luck!” We’d be naming airports after him. The man got us out of Viet Nam, opened up China and helped invent Détente- those are seriously impressive Presidential Acts. If you think I’m joking about it then don’t believe me- just look at Martha Stewart. If she’d have been honest about doing something wrong she would have paid a fine, got a suspended sentence or probation and a book deal. She lied and now she’s looking at the business end of 20 Large in a Federal Pen!  Since I play fair I have trouble when the Government doesn’t. There are good things in the Patriot Act. For example it brings Law Enforcement into the Electronic Age. However, the bad far outweighs the good. The first is that the very name is something only a Propaganda Minister could love. The second is that it includes the words that strike at the very heart of the Republic. If the Devil had two lieutenants they would be named Random and Secrecy because those are the folks who knock on your door at Midnight and take you to an ‘undisclosed location’ where the only call you get to make is “Help!” Also, in a blatant attempt to pull an ‘end-run’ around that pesky little document known as The Constitution some of the so-called provisions have Sunset Clauses in them. A Sunset Clause means that after a certain amount of time that part expires. Now let me assure you that NOTHING the government does EVER expires.  Take out your telephone bill and look at the taxes on it. Part of them are a TEMPORARY measure to pay for the Spanish American War. We won, it happened so long ago I’m willing to bet you 9 out of 10 people can’t even tell you what it was about and we have definitely paid off that bill. No one is sending me past due notices on it that’s for certain! That is the Bureaucratic Definition of Temporary in Action. Provisions of TPA were supposed to expire in 2003. Guess what? They didn’t! If we don’t force our Elected Officials to do the right thing with a judicious use of the Ballot Box in November your Great-grandchildren will be wondering why every electronic medium from the telephone to the cable/satellite and the ISP bill still has that ‘temporary increase in the Universal Usage Fee’ still on it! And that is the least of our problems when the State forces us to be ‘Patriotic’ or ‘Good Americans’.  Even being Disabled has implications under the so-called 'Patriot Act' because we spend what, to some, is an excessive amount of time on the Net. Which, under TPA, is ‘suspicious’ and ‘Cause for Action’ in and of itself. They overlook the fact that more than any other group we depend on our Computers as a way of maintaining a functioning place in our Society. We do everything from pay bills, order medications or groceries to attending Support Group Meetings on them. If you are Homebound it is often your most important link to the world outside your four walls because it is often the only way we have to make new friends and participate in Social Discourse. They even know this because various branches of the U.S. Government consider our Computers as "Assisted Living Devices". You can actually get a prescription so that your fees are considered legitimate Medical Expenses when they are determining your income eligibility for other Programs.  Now Dubya and Company want to institute a little thing called a National ID Card complete with a place for your thumbprint since a Picture ID is subjective. Hair, eye and even skin color can be altered. But everyone needs that opposable thumb! The reasons they give seem ever so reasonable. Cutting down on costly and time consuming anti-terrorist measures because you have a card that says you already been through a Security Clearance. Getting all those illegal aliens off our Public Assistance Rolls will allow us to use our Tax Dollars for our own Disabled or Poor. People are going hungry or suffering from lack of services because we are taking care of another Nation’s problems. They are even arguing that it will help the Homeless because you won’t need a permanent address to receive assistance AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR CARD. I am Advocate for the Disabled. I am Disabled myself so surely I must agree with the end result. After all, a National ID card is just like having a State ID or Driver’s License or Social Security Card. Just something else to stuff in your wallet and pull out when you write a check or deal with the government. Right? Wrong!  I saw this coming WAY before that Drunk hit me. I can live with the idea of a Social Security Card because it is a necessary evil in a large society. There’s your National ID. I remember when a State ID went from a good idea if you wanted to write a check and didn’t drive to a legal requirement in most States at the age of 18. I remember the first time I had to prove I was an American to get a job. I remember when mandatory Drug Testing was only for those in ‘High Risk Jobs’ and not for someone pushing paper in a cubical at some Office Park. I remember when it became legal to vote for your President and die for your country but illegal to be trusted to drink responsibly and buy a beer!  I’ll leave you with two thoughts. In an age where a car can recognize it’s owner and you don’t need a key WHAT ELSE CAN THEY PUT ON THAT LITTLE CARD? If you were born and raised in America, always paid your taxes, maybe served in the Armed Forces and occasionally voted what happens if the GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO GIVE YOU ONE?  Think about it.

        Mood: ALONE  Playing: PAT BENATAR: HELL IS FOR CHILDREN  MARCH 9TH, 2004 UPDATE  This case has been investigated by competent authorities at the Police Department, the High School and the Department of Human Services. There were problems but thankfully not as bad as we feared. Most importantly this family is getting the help they need. Right now the best thing is for us all to stay out of it. Let the people on the scene do their work and let this family heal privately.  Thank you all.  Slan, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever Cabin Fever Online   PS When I said privately I meant it. I have edited my article and comments to remove this person's name, age and location. Unfortunately, if you left a comment mentioning these things I had to delete it because I could not change it. Please be assured ALL remarks were read and your opinions of me and whether my parents were aquainted with each other when I was conceived have been duly noted. Keeping in mind my partial loss of sight please let me know if I missed any. e/cf     Achairde All:  If you’ve been following along you will know that we’ve had a bit of a ‘situation’ here at Cabin Fever Online. Even on days I don’t write a column I check in, read email from readers and visit the sites of people who have just ‘found me’. I do this to thank them for coming by, to read what they have to say and to occasionally Comment on what’s going on in their lives. Normally if I have something of a personal nature to say to someone I will ISM &/or email them. This is out of respect for their privacy. Unfortunately, I found myself in a situation where the person chose to openly post remarks in my Chatterbox. What should have been handled privately has become a sort of mini-drama at my site. I’ve gotten quite a few questions about it so I am going to explain the problem. I am doing this so that someday, if you come across the same problem, you will understand that it has to be taken seriously. That you will know what to look for and what certain ‘signs’ really mean.   A few days ago I noticed a newbie by the name of XXXXXXX. I was alarmed by what I read in her March 1st Post entitled ‘XXXXX…’ Her appearance in her picture and the statements she made in other items clearly showed me that this was someone in a great deal of pain. Needless to say ‘Red Flags’ that were drilled into me when I decided to leave Insurance for Teaching were popping up everywhere and they were telling me to help her. She is XX and she spoke openly about her bruises, the fact that she stays at school as much as possible helping anyone and everyone with their projects and how she wished that she had somewhere to go to get away from her Mother.   I contacted several friends and resources and I wrote her to offer her a place to stay while she and her Mother got things straightened out. A friend offered to pay her way from XXXXXXX to Florida. Another offered to help her apply to be an "Emancipated Minor" and another was willing to provide some counseling free of charge. Our main goal was to get her somewhere safe so she could choose what she wanted to do about her life and her situation. I also made it clear that if she was not comfortable with the idea of coming to Florida I would report the Abuse to her State and they could take it from there.  What followed was a text book case of ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ all of the sudden it was her fault for being abused. She had been a bad daughter. She didn’t need any help. She didn’t want any help. She even faked a message to me that was supposedly her Mom promising to stop abusing her. XXXXXXX vehemently insisted that she could handle this on her own. I had printed out her ORIGINAL blog. THE ONE WITH HER INFORMATION AND PHOTOGRAPH SO I HAVE HARD COPIES TO SEND TO THE AUTHORITIES IF NEEDED. I am SO glad I did because from one day to the next all suicidal remarks were gone, entire Posts had been removed, there was a new picture at the top of the page and the information under Personal Information had been changed. She deleted her name, date of birth and her location changed from XXXXXXX to Germany. I suppose she thought this would prove to the authorities that everything was ‘just fine at home’. When, in fact, everything she did proves that things are even worse then she had originally admitted. People who work with abused children see this everyday. Children will lie to protect their abusive parent from reasons such as love, fear of being taken away or fear the parent will discover they have revealed the family secret and severely beat or even murder them for doing so.  There is another possibility and it is one that truly frightens me. That it was not XXXXXX but her mother her changed her website, deleted her information and changed her location. It would be simpler to just leave that information out or to simply put in another State. The fact that it is being made to appear that XXXXXX is not in America her mother may be hoping to avoid the National Child Abuse Hotlines. That is not a decision your average XX year old would even think to make. Also, the writing is off. It sounds in her latest Post as if it were an adult attempting to sound like a teenager. I am concerned that her daughter is either unable or being prevented from contact with people who might help her. I am also worried that she may be injured in some way.  Several years ago I was involved in a case where I went out on a date with a man and we ended up going to the pool at his apartment complex to have an impromptu party with his friends. I noticed one boy there who was significantly younger than the other guests, appeared disheveled and made the rounds asking people for spare change to get something at the store. When I finally asked what was going on I was horrified. The boy’s mother was an alcoholic who would disappear for days and whenever she did that his step-father would lock him out of the apartment until she returned. A few people remarked that he had been sleeping on the lounge chairs by the pool. A few others said that they had given him a couple of dollars to buy food at the convenience store and one man said he had given the boy an old beach sheet to cover up with. These were ADULTS who felt BAD for the kid but didn’t want to ‘get involved’!   Needless to say I cut my date short, talked to the boy and said, “If you want you can come back to my house with us. I’ll cook dinner for you while you shower and you can sleep on my couch tonight. We’ll work out what to do tomorrow.” We took him back to my place and the next morning I called a Social Worker I knew and they came and got him and placed a warrant out for his Mother. To be honest with you I don’t know who I was angrier with- his mother, his stepfather or the people who had watched him sleep by that pool for 3 days caging money for sodas and a bag of Doritos!  The Social Worker kept me up to date on the Case and sure enough- when it came time for him to testify you would have thought his mother was the greatest mother in the world. He said she was out of town on business and he had argued with his stepfather and that it was his FAULT the man locked him out for 3 days. He also insisted that it had never happened before even though the Property Manager stated that she had found him ‘camping out’ more than a dozen times in 7 months. He even claimed that the previous time he had been removed from her custody was his fault- at the age of 5!  So, today I will be talking with the Authorities. There will be an investigation and there will be an assessment done of XXXXXXX needs. Some people will justify not getting involved because she doesn’t want this. But if you do learn anything from me, as my rabid emailer suggested, please let it be this: WE DO NOT PLAY WITH PEOPLES LIVES. WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS HELP YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GIVE IT EVEN WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT IT’S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.  At the end of the day I have to face myself in the mirror. If it makes some of you uncomfortable or even angry then I will just have to live with it because I am the adult, there is a child who needs help and I wasn’t put here on Earth to take the easy or popular way out. Let’s all just hope that the XXXXXXXX and her family will get the help they need. That there will be healing for all involved. That, when we come across the next child in this situation, we will be strong enough make the tough call before they become just another statistic.

            Mood: STANDING UP  Playing: SISTERS OF MERCY: THIS CORROSION  :::CF SMILES WITH MOCK SEVERITY:::THERE WILL BE NO WIGGING ON THE BLOG LEGNTH FROM NEWBIES!!!THERE IS A LONG LETTER TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF FATHER...OOPS! MY BAD! THAT'S HOMELAND SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE!  Achairde All!  Since we have already settled on the fact that I am a 'corrupting influence' on 'THE YOUTH OF OUR GREAT NATION' by encouraging such acts as emailing Politicians to let them know you approve/disapprove of their actions along with actively promoting that you Vote and other nefarious Acts of A Democratic Society. I figured- 'IF I'M GOING TO BE HUNG AS A CATTLE RUSTLER I MIGHT AS WELL GET A STEAK OUT OF IT!' The Office of Homeland Security has segued into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It is no secret that I am distinctly UNFOND of the name, nor am I a big fan of the compilation of a list of Domestic Terrorists Organizations, without Disclosure.   Having grown up in Washington D.C. I fully respect the fact that after 9-11 we needed to get our heads out of the sand and pay attention to our oh-so-open-to-all Borders. I lost friends in the Pentagon and New York. I even understand that while investigations are underway we should not expect the United States government to 'share' details until AFTER they have concluded their work. What I DO object to is the secrecy once they have finished. Secrecy is a good way to investigate someone or something but it is a LOUSY way to run a country. ESPECIALLY OUR COUNTRY. In fact, I think that 'outting' Terrorists is a GOOD thing.   Before you go ballistic let's think about this rationally. IF you are NOT a Terrorist and they are wrong you have a chance to prove that you are not a danger to others. The Court of Public Opinion is a harsh place to make your case against somebody whose chief form of Protest is email. However, IF YOU ARE a Terrorist then you and your organization is, for lack of a more delicate phrase, screwed. To be effective as a Terrorist you NEED secrecy- without it your cover is blown and everyone from the next door neighbor to the town constable is going to be watching to see if you purchase several thousand pounds of fertilizer and a couple dozen cans of gas. It's hard to plan a bomb when the guys at the Home Depot are on to you. It's impossible to deliver one if the Rent-A-Car Company will definitely NOT pick your bomb-planting butt up!  What scares me are the groups who are being mentioned in hushed tones in the Oval Office but have their Non-Profit Papers up-to-date, they have a telephone number/website/snail mail addresses and have been in business for years without doing ANYTHING remotely Terrorist. I belong to a few of these groups and I am NOT happy that someone wants to put me on their List. I am even more unhappy when I hear from friends, associates and sources that a group I belong to wasn't even investigated. They just ASSUMED we were Terrorists.  Then to add insult to injury certain Ethnic Groups are marked for Special Treatment. Dubya calls it National Security and the UN calls it Ethnic Cleansing. I am speaking of course, of the President's attempt to 'back door' amendments to our Extradition Treaty with Great Britain. He, the Conservative Party in England and those wonderful folks at Stormont want to just completely by-pass the US Judicial System and ship you to Belfast or London WITHOUT EVIDENCE because you are a Terrorist Threat. Their definition of a threat is that SOMEONE TOLD THEM YOU ARE and the kicker here is that in the North of Ireland ALL IT TAKES IS THE WORD OF AN INFORMANT AND THEY PAY INFORMANTS THERE! KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO CLAIMED THEY HAD EVIDENCE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND PROVIDED THIS JUICY BIT OF INTEL TO THE PRESIDENT AND ARE NOW SAYING 'OOPS WAS THAT US?'  The DHS is also after the AIM because of what happened at Wounded Knee during the 1970's!!! It makes me wonder who is slipping under their radar while they're wasting time harassing honest folk. It's cheaper and easier to point your finger at someone you already hate. Unfortunately, hunting for SNIPE isn't a good way to protect the 'Homeland'.  In this spirit I wrote Governor Ridge. The letter is below. I would encourage you to write one of your own even if you are not a member of the groups I've mentioned. Because History proves that after the Secret Police are done rounding up the 'Usual Suspects' they WILL be coming for you next!  February 27th, 2004 Tampa, Florida USA  U.S. Department of Homeland Security The Office of the Homeland Security Director Governor Tom Ridge Washington D.C.  Dear Governor Ridge:  It has recently come to my attention, from three independent sources, that a few of the organizations I belong to either are on the Domestic Terrorist List compiled by the DHS or are under consideration as possible additions. They are:  AIM (American Indian Movement) IAUC (Irish American Unity Conference) INA (Irish Northern Aid) Sinn Fein USA  Since NONE of these organizations are even remotely connected to terrorism- foreign or domestic I am alarmed that in our current zeal to protect American Citizens we may be, in fact, violating the Civil Rights of the very people we are trying to protect.  While, I respect that those ongoing investigations concerning legitimate threats cannot be commented on. I also feel that it is the duty of the Director and the DHS to clear up any confusion over groups, which operate within the bounds of the law. If, as Director you are reluctant to identify peaceful organizations I would remind you Sir, that such actions place the Constitution of our great country in peril.  We have had our era of secret lists of Un-American Organizations and hearings requiring citizens to defend their Political Beliefs or reveal the convictions of others. I do not think the President, and certainly not the American People, wish to relive those frightening times. In this spirit, I believe it is the duty of the Director to state outright any organizations, which are NOT under investigation or considered as Terrorist threats. Failure to do so is to encourage Public Paranoia and the defamation of American's engaging in Freedom of Speech. Your office and your website should make every effort to stop such rumors and publicly support those participating in the Democratic Process.  Sincerely, Elaine M. Hinchey Cabin Fever Online http://cabinfever.modblog.com  Think about it. If you can, leave me YOUR opinions, I really want to know where other people stand on this issue.  I'll load the RESPECT column next week. Until then, keep the faith folks!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever   PS Please don't forget mindcandy and his family.

I am speaking, of course, about my last article and the picture that went with it. We all know I have a penchant for quizzes. We all know that I write (here and elsewhere) and I think we would all agree that the response I received to my email was ridiculous. Honestly, I think we would all agree that it was just this side of ludicrous. So no problem- right?  Wrong. You ever get one of those people who think they're on some sort of mission from God and are going to take all Eternity (if need be) to get you to agree with them? Of course you have. We all have. When I was younger by a decade or three I would engage in the Great Debate. Since I don't mind getting older as long as I don't get OLD I have picked up a few lessons here and there. Which I will happily ‘impart’ to you no matter what your age! One of the most important is "Never enter into a discussion with someone who knocks on your door at dinner time and wants to 'share' the Good News with you." You are not going to win an ecclesiastical debate with them because anyone rude enough to knock at your door while you're family is eating and won't go away quietly when you say you're not interested is NOT going to let little things like Ethics or Philosophy stop them!  My solution, as much as goes against my upbringing, is to ask who it is THROUGH THE DOOR WITHOUT OPENING IT! When, they reply I always yell THROUGH THE DOOR: "No thanks. I'm Roman Catholic. God Bless You. Goodbye!" The key here is DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR! If you do you DESERVE it so don't cry to me. Now the really bizarre part of this is that I always walk away from the door and go about my business but have on several occasions returned 20 minutes later to let someone else inside and I have found them still there preaching to my front door. I guess that if they can't get me they figure the door might be more open to conversion. Pardon the pun!  Another hard won lesson is one most of us here received from our mothers. Of course when she told us we were far too smart to listen to it but I think you will find, as countless generations before, the older you get the smarter your parents get. Trust me on this. Better you should hear that piece of bad news from a friend. I am referring to that old parental adage; "If you argue with an idiot what does that make you?" You WILL NOT BELIEVE what a time-saver that little gem is! I can't tell you the number of times when either I was ticked off at someone or was accosted by a person who was DETERMINED to make me see reason (usually whatever pet theory they had or their religion) and I opened my mouth ONLY to close it. This is followed by my excusing myself and either getting the 'Hell out of Dodge' or if trapped as far away from them as humanly possible.  Because, in that instant between opening and closing my mouth I ask myself one question. The question is:  "If I beat this person up one side and down the other with the Stupid Stick are they going to get any smarter or will I just have a tired arm to show for my efforts?"  I am sorry if you were hoping for something a bit more profound. That's about as profound as I ever get. Please note that this does NOT mean lively intellectual debate. I LIKE lively intellectual debate. I can and have spent hours in such a pursuit. I don't require it to be something on a cosmic scale so that it even makes allowances for things such as which sports team is better than another, which is the best Hitchcock film and whether Popeyes or KFC has the best chicken. (OK that last one was a bit shaky but you understand what I mean.)  SO, when I received an email from a reader castigating me for being an Élitist and corrupting minors I was (to put it mildly) a bit surprised. I don't control the outcomes of quizzes. I don't know what's going to pop up when I hit 'submit'. It dovetailed beautifully with my topic and I thought the "Don't make me Exposé your ass!" was hysterical and very appropriate. I figured you would find it mildly amusing as well. Also, I do not think I was encouraging 'unpatriotic behavior in people who look to you as an example'. Probably because I don't know the ages of the people who read me. Even if I did it wouldn't change a thing. Basically because I am writing about things that I feel are important and I would NEVER be so full of it that I regarded myself as an example for ANYONE. If I did want to 'inspire' anyone it would be to annoy all the Politicians who are doing things you disagree with and make sure they know that you're watching them. Since that is called, "Participating in the Democratic Process", I would regard that as a GOOD THING. Ya think?  All of which I sent to this person, very politely. I figured that would be the end of it................ BUT OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! ! Now, normally I would not respond to an additional email accusing me of everything but the Johnstown Flood but I hadn't figured out if this person was dumb or just stupid. Dumb is OK. Dumb means you don't KNOW something but are willing to listen to new information. I, myself, am dumb about a great many things. I am fine with this because I believe in learning something new everyday. In fact, on any given evening while watching a documentary I will say (outloud), "I didn't know that!" Stupid is dumb and NOT willing to listen to new information, other people's personal convictions or ideas. Also, I like to give people the doubt. We all have our off days! In this spirit I wrote them back, explained my confusion and pointedly asked, "Exactly what are you accusing me of here?"  Their reply erased ALL doubt between dumb and stupid. Nope, no question now! I was half expecting, "Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party?"  Which brings me to my conclusion and another important lesson I have learned along the way. THE BLOCK SENDER BUTTON IS YOUR FRIEND!!!  Now THAT’S profound!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever

       urlLink Blogroll Me!      Achairde All:  Back over at ModBlog mindcandy and I are engaged in a little debate over the The Nature of Porn. He began with with his "Keep Your Rosaries Off Her Ovaries" Post where I left this Comment:  “Oookkkaaayy, what's up with the Rosaries and Ovaries? We don't get nearly as bent as say the Baptists or Church of Godder's do. I think you'll find that in general your average Catholic feels as long as it isn't forced on us or involves children and animals we really don't care what other people do in their personal lives. We expect, but do not often receive, the same courtesy from others.  The only flaws I found in your reasoning is that there is a Casual Link between Serial Rapists and Murderers and Violent Pornography as well as your more Sexualized 'Slasher' Flicks. I am, of course, referring to the Experiments done by Behaviorists concerning the impact on male viewers. Also, John Douglas and the FBI Profiling Unit have collected a large amount of data in their studies of such criminals. I am not speaking of your 'slap and tickle' type but the shock proofing of our Society is leading filmmaker’s to go to more and explicit portrayals to turn a buck. As for First Amendment Issues, Pornography is Commerce and not Free Speech. Commercial Enterprises do not have the same protections under the Law. That same Law prohibits Cigarette Manufacturers and the purveyors of Hard Liquor off the American Airwaves even though both products are, in fact, Legal in this country. I have never heard of a NFP for Porn, have you? LOL  I think the best definition of what Pornography is came from an episode of Designing Women in which one of the characters tells another that there are only 9 people in the US who DON'T know what Pornography is and they're all on the Supreme Court. The other character comes back with, "Well, why don't they ask the Owners of Adult Book Stores? They know what to buy. Or the guy who runs the Adult Theatre because he knows what to show - it's not like he's going to get all confused and start showing Gandhi!" LMAO  I ran your Thesis past one of my cousin's who is a Detective in the Rape/Homicide Squad in Prince Georges County Maryland. His reply was, "The first time I toss a Perp's house after one of these crimes and I DON'T find any Violent Porn (he's NOT speaking about Playboy and Hustler here) I'll write your friend. Just tell him not to hold his breath!" Since he's been through VICAP at Quantico I think you can safely say that he, too, is an Expert Witness.  Keep the Faith!  Slan chara, Elaine/cf  PS Ya picked Rosaries because it rhymes with Ovaries, didn't ya! 0;) e/cf   Long story short ~ he wrote another Post based on my Comment and thus began "THE GREAT PORN DEBATE"! 0;)  Now since we are friends and we both like a Good Intellectual Debate we set some Ground Rules and it was 'Bullet Points at 20 Paces'. Those of you who also read CABIN FEVER ONLINE over at ModBlog http://cabinfever.modblog.com know that is my Work Site and this is my Personal one. The main reason being that CFO is also a Resource for Disabled Services, Human Rights Organizations and Government Agencies. So, I asked that we keep the Debate off of it.  So, here is the Opening Salvo in toto. I have to get mindcandy's permission before I move his Response to this here. However, if you are curious I have linked his blog and as soon as I get an OK I will Post it.  Keep the Faith Folks!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever CABIN FEVER: THE RANTS  Posted by: CabinFever (Online) Date: 5/27/04 at 2:31PM (21h33m ago)      Achairde MC:  WOW am I an inspiration or WHAT! ROTFLMAO All THAT off my Comment? What you forgot to tell your readers because I think you are missing the point here is that I am not against Pornography (Ain't my cup of tea ~ but neither is Golf. A so-called Sport that, personally, I feel was invented by a loser who couldn’t make the Hurling Team! But that’s another story!) What I am against is Violent Deviant Incident (VDI) Pornography. Since we both love Lively Intellectual Debate let’s establish a few Ground Rules on our Discussion, K? But first, you were right ~ I meant to type VICOD and typed VICAP. MY BAD! VICOD is the Violent Crimes and Offenders Database It is used by State and Local Law Enforcement to find out if the Perv they’re tracking is unique to their area or has been ‘sharing the wealth’, so to speak. The reason it is called VICOD is because sometimes they have a Crime WITHOUT and Offender to match it with. So they feed all the details into the computer, the FBI stores it and an Investigator from BFE South Dakota can search for Crimes where the Victim had an ear removed, for example. You get a Mea Culpa on me for that one.  As for Ground Rules I think it’s best if we decide WHAT we’re debating about. Me, I am AGAINST VDI Porn. I am AGAINST the concept that the Adult Entertainment Business is a First Amendment Issue and not the purview of the Local Zoning Commission, the FCC or OSHA. I am also AGAINST the self-deception that Commercial Violence be it a movie, video game or comic book causes NO desensitization of it’s viewers. Also, this is a Debate about FACTS and not emotions. I know YOU AND I understand that ~ but I think it’s important that the Readers know it too. They’ve managed to keep ModBlog pretty FLAME FREE and I think we owe it to them to respect that Policy (PHVS aside!) LOL  All right, let’s break out the Bullet Points at 20 Paces mo chara!   ANYTHING Pornographic that involves Animals, Children, Death or Torture is VDI. For Example: Inserting a sewer rat into a woman’s vagina or a man’s anal cavity so that it can chew and claw it’s way out is VDI. Annie, Betty and Carl having a threesome is NOT. Unless, of course, one of them is packing a sewer rat.   The Adult Entertainment Industry is a BUSINESS and as such should be Regulated as one while receiving the same First Amendment Protections afforded any Corporation or Shopkeeper. The person filming a 30 person Sex Fest is NOT Robert Altman. They are not Artists in search of a venue. They are business people who wouldn’t continue to do so if they weren’t making money from it. The presumption that they are no different than say Van Gogh or even Mapplethorpe, is at best, a Legal Maneuver to keep the Courts off their backs. At it’s worse it is Hubris that insults every Musician, Painter or Writer who sacrificed their livelihoods and their health in the Elusive Premise of Art for Arts sake There is a difference, like it or not, between starving in a 16 Floor Walk-Up and tossing back a few while you’re on a Sound Stage or Set. For Example: OSHA should have the right to enforce Work Place Safety Rules even if the item in question is a Condom. If you jeopardize the Health and Wellbeing of your Employees to maximize your Bottom Line you are NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY SWEATSHOP OWNER.   Repeated exposure to Violent Images or Acts, including Sexual ones, does have a negative impact on the Intellect and Emotions of the Viewer. This Premise is supported by the American College of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the American Association of Psychologists. The FBI also supports it, as does Interpol, based on Evidence seized by warrant from Pedophiles, Serial Rapists and Serial Killers. For Example: Yesterday a clown, employed by Ringling Brothers, was arrested for Child Molestation and amongst the Evidenced Seized were over 10,000 Pornographic Pictures and Films found in his home. Which came first ~ the Chicken or the Egg? Did he have those items because he was a Pedophile or did he view such items BEFORE he molested his first victim? Is there a '‘cut off age” for when children become immune to Psychological Damage simply because they turn 18 or 21? If it affected you on May 26th of 2004 and you come of Age on May 27th there’s a pretty substantial reason to expect it to STILL have the same Negative Impact.  As for the Religious Right, these are the SAME people who tell me that Oswald went to Heaven because he was ‘saved’ at the age of 11 and Kennedy went to Hell because he was a Catholic. For all they’re Posturing, Pronouncements and Proclamations they have about as much effect as the dead yeast in Beer. It might be there but it’s NOT accomplishing anything. I’ve been Lobbying for over half of my life. I’ve seen them traipse into a Politician’s Office, do their act and leave. Once they’re safely out of Hearing Range the Official’s usual response is, “Well, there’s sixty minutes of my life I’ll never get back!”  So, unless it becomes impossible for people to purchase “Jumbo Jugs” here in the good ole’ US of A I wouldn’t sweat it. Because, realistically, at the end of the day the Fanatics and the Fans are pretty much back where they started off. Me, as I said before I REALLY don’t care what ‘floats other people’s boats, in fact the SHEAR MAGNITUDE OF THE DEPTH OF MY INDIFFERENCE would leave people breathless in it’s scope! Elaine isn’t against Pornography because she’s much to busy worrying about the Political Prisoner who was given ‘Gasoline Visine’ during his interrogation and is now blind. THAT’S my idea of a First Amendment Issue!  (PERSONAL COMMENT TO MINDCANDY HERE)  Thanks cariad!  Slan leat, Elaine AKA Cabin Fever CABIN FEVER ONLINE  PS I did not use any of the Case Studies you sited in your column. Park is a god and Douglas did some damn fine work for 25 years before he sold out! 0;) e/cf

        Mood: HOPEFUL  Playing: (OLD LULLABYE) TURN AROUND*  Achairde All:  Sorry it took so long to get back to you Folks but it’s been a wee bit weird around here. Actually, it’s been MASSIVELY WEIRD around here. But I’ll save it for another column or column(s). That’s been happening quite a bit around here, hasn’t it! Every time I get ready to run this particular column SOMETHING happens. I am about ready to delete it for being a Bad Luck Magnet! LOL There are a couple of reasons that changed today’s topic. One of them was Etanisla’s response to her Golden Cabin Award:  Posted by: Etanisla Date: 5/24/04 at 9:55AM (1d10h ago) I'm not taken aback (really!), I'm flattered and shocked!  *ahem*  I take this award in honor of my mother, who taught me to stand up for myself, and not bend to the dictations of machismo and other people's sense of culture. And in honor of my father, for when he realized that I wasn't going to grow up to be a Puerto Rican Princess, instead encouraged me to be a Puerto Rican Queen and take charge of my life.  Thanks Elaine!  The second reason has to do with the girl I pay to do the House Cleaning once a month. She’s a 17-year-old High School Student who lives in the Apartment Complex and her family puts the ‘Dys’ in Dysfunctional! She came over the other day to clean and her Mother came by after her first day at her new job. It’s what happened during her ‘visit’ that made me put the article I was planning to run today back on the Spike.   This woman went on a rant about her daughter based on what she heard Third Hand from another tenant. It was one of those ‘he said/she said’ situations and I don’t really understand why she felt she had to bring the problem into my Home. However, I can tell you that I was appalled (with 3 Ps a la Binkley of Bloom County!) Right in front of her daughter she spent an hour telling me that the girl was a compulsive liar, a thief, a user and an instigator. The poor kid just sat there looking at me as if she was an abandoned kitten in a Pound cage with 30 minutes to go before the gassed her!   I did attempt to diffuse the situation. I tried explaining that it was improbable that her daughter had done what she was accused of since she was in my apartment when the alleged incident occurred. I told her that I had never seen any evidence of the behavior she was referring to and since she comes here everyday to check on me while we watch BTVS & Angel I didn’t see where she had the time to cause that much trouble. Nothing I said made a dent in her tirade. Every other remark was concluded with her slapping her hands back and forth while stating, “If she doesn’t behave I tell her I wash my hands of her! She can go live on the street!” :::SLAP SLAP:::  I’m not saying the kid is a Saint but she’s not Lizzie Borden either! NOT to mention how INAPPROPRIATE it is to correct and denigrate your child in front of a Virtual Stranger. If she wanted to punish her ~ TAKE HER HOME! I’m the woman who loses consciousness periodically when she’s here. I EMPLOY her to assist me with the heavy household chores. Talk about your BAD references! The other thing was that this woman KNOWS I am Disabled and in poor health ~ did she stop to think that MAYBE I didn’t need that kind of stress in MY life? NOOO! After ascertaining that she was Uber Stupid Stick material I herded her towards the door and shut it politely BEHIND her. Basically because, if she slapped her hands together in that ‘I Wash My Hands of You Maneuver’ just ONE more time, there was a good chance I was going to forget MY manners and bitch slap her!  So, what does this have to do with what Etanisla wrote or the 2nd Greatest Gift you can give your kids? It’s because the Gift is ALLOWING YOUR CHILDREN TO MAKE MISTAKES. God knows we ALL make them. You did and unless you’ve come down with a ‘Major Case of Perfect’ ~ you are STILL making them! WRITE IT DOWN. IF you are a parent please think about it for your sake and the sake of your child. IF you are a child copy this and give it to your parents. This DOES NOT mean that there shouldn’t be consequences for their actions. It means that parents should realize that IF every time a child does something wrong or makes a mistake and tries to be honest about if they WIG pretty soon that child WILL start lying to cover their mistakes. That’s when things go from BAD TO WORSE in 0 to 60 seconds! Not to mention that it teaches them that lying is the right way to handle a problem. Can you say, “Screwed up for Life!”? This will ONLY make the situation worse. Lying AFTER the mistake makes one problem into two. Don’t take my word for it ~ look at History. Nixon lied to protect his friends. Martha Stewart lied about Insider Trading. Take a look at what happened to them. In BOTH cases it was the LIE that caused the most trouble and NOT the mistake!  Here’s a Case History for you to ponder. My parents raised four daughters. They had a very simple list of Rules:   IF you are going to drink do it IN the house. Don’t sneak around getting drunk at parties. You could get hurt or arrested or raped doing that.  IF you are going to smoke Marijuana tell them and they would get it for you. This was back in the 70s when people were adding Angel Dust and horse Tranquilizers to it. This way they could make sure it was ‘clean’.  IF you are going to be sexually active tell Mom so she could get you on the Pill (this was PRE-AIDS). Because there would be no abortions. IF we were under 16 they would adopt the child as their own. IF you were over 16 they would help you raise it. There would be NO shotgun marriages in our Family.  IF you got into trouble you were to tell them immediately. As long as we were honest with them they would do their best to help us through it but we were NOT going to be punished ANYWHERE close to what would happen if we tried to cover it up. This included those stupid things people do just because, “At the time it seemed like a good idea.”  EXAMPLE: The DAY I got my Driver’s License I was supposed to take my cousins and a friend to a movie to celebrate. It would be my first Solo. We had this behemoth of a station wagon and since I had been driving a Beetle I wasn’t used to it. While I was backing out of our parking space I clipped the rear bumper of the car next to us. Trust me when I say I FREAKED! I pulled back in, got a piece of paper and pen out of my purse and wrote out a note explaining what happened and giving my name and phone number. I put the note under the wiper blade on the driver’s side and walked back to the house. Even though there was NO damage to our car (you couldn’t tell it had been touched) all I could think was, “The next time they let me drive I’m going to be 30!”  I went to my Dad and explained everything to him. THE MAN DID NOT YELL, SCREAM OR HIT ME. First he said that accidents happen. Then he told me he was PROUD of me for doing the responsible thing by leaving my contact information. He also said that he appreciated me telling him about it instead of covering it up just because there was no damage to our car. After we talked he asked me if I still wanted to go the movies? When I said yes he handed the keys back to me and said to be home by 11:00p.m. (I will admit that I damn near fainted when he did that!) The next day the woman who owned the car called our house and said she couldn’t believe that someone would actually leave a note. When she found out I was 16 she told my Father that he had raised one very responsible daughter because most adults wouldn’t have left her their information.  IF my parents had been the types to scream and punish us for honest mistakes do you think I would have acted the way I did? Would YOU have left a note ~ even though that’s what the Law says to do? I DON’T think so. I worked in insurance for a number of years and only once did I have a Claim where the driver did the right thing. I knew that my Dad would not punish me for being honest with him. That knowledge allowed me to take responsibility for my actions and isn’t that what, as Mothers and Fathers, you WANT your children to do? I hope so!  As for all of the Rules, my friends thought I had the greatest parents in the world. When I was in High School I came home more than once to find one of my friends sitting in the kitchen and talking to my Mom. Even when they knew I wasn’t Home or expecting company. Many of them came to my Mom just to talk or ask her advice on a problem. More than once having an adult to talk to made the difference between dealing with an issue rather then becoming another Teen Suicide Statistic. FYI not one of us had a teen pregnancy, drug or alcohol problem and ALL four of us went on to College. Peer Pressure was NOT an issue with us ~ we had no problems saying NO to our friends and Classmates! BTW the Odds against having four such ‘dull’ daughters are pretty astronomical. I found that out when I decided to leave Insurance and become a Teacher.  I was in my 20s when I realized that not only did I have ‘cool’ parents ~ I had clever and intelligent ones. Half the time kids do stupid things out of Rebellion and thrill they get from it. By giving us permission to do things at Home they effectively took all the ‘fun’ out of being a Rebellious Teenager! After I figured it out I went to my Mom and told her, jokingly, that she ‘robbed me of some real Juvenile Angst’! I said, “You and Dad did that so we wouldn’t be tempted to go out and do something stupid, didn’t you!” She just grinned at me and replied, “It worked, didn’t it? You can’t argue with success!”  She was right! Give yourself and your children that Gift. I know how precious it is. What’s the worst that can happen? You might just end up with a few ‘dull’ kids of your own. Now wouldn’t THAT be a SHAME! 0;)  Keep the Faith!

        Mood: I DON’T Want to Be Around Me (And THAT’S BAD!)  Playing: Shane McGowan & Sinead O’Connor – Haunted (From Sid & Nancy)  She's done it before and will probably do it again. Much gratitude to Etanisla for the above title and her unflagging support in a life that's been rather a trial for me lately.  THANKS AGAIN CHARA!  Slan, Elaine/cf  COMMENTS:  Posted by: Etanisla Date: 6/27/04 at 12:21AM (2d12h ago)  My goodness, Elaine! How can a person even begin to summarize all THAT in one catchy title. The only thing I can think of is "Damned if I do, Dead if I don't", or something horribly cliche like that. Where do you hide the stamina it takes to endure all of this?  Your force of will alone is a force to be reckoned with. When God formed your backbone, He put titanium mixed with kryptonite just to make sure you can still stand.  Remind me, never to piss you off! I don't want to be in the same zipcode when you unload on someone. Oh, wait, now that I've thought about it, that explains how you are able to navigate the mine-seeded waters of government services!  I wish you well, and pray for you often. (Agh, I'm throwing homily-cliches again! Don't know what else to say, really. I'm nowhere near as strong as you, and am in awe of your mental fortitude.)  Let me sign off, before I really stick my foot in my mouth.  ____________________ ____________________ ________  Posted by: CabinFever (Online) Date: 6/29/04 at 12:59PM (8m33s ago)   Achairde Etanisla:  Well, no surprise here, but you've managed another Golden Cabin Award. I don't think "Damned if I do, Dead if I don't!" is cliched. Actually I think it captures the situation better than any title I could have come up with!  Your comments left me feeling very grateful and very humble. I don't know that I deserve them. All I can say is that the alternative is to let the Bastard's win and beat me down. I guess I'm just too damn stuborn for that.  Thank you so much!  Slan, Elaine/cf  LIFE IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WHILE YOU'RE MAKING PLANS ~ DON'T FORGET TO LIVE IT!     Achairde All!  Ssshhheeesss Bbbaaaccckkk! And you’ve got her. No sympathy either ~ it’s not like I MADE you come here, now is it? 0;) WARNING SHOT! If you find my sense of humor a bit hard to take this would be the sentence to be elsewhere! You might try Googling “PTSD” or “Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder”. Just to keep yourself in the CABIN FEVER ONLINE loop. To the brave at heart: if you stay, don’t cry to me. Basically because I am two steps away from solving America’s Health Care Crisis and my solution involves a 30-30 and a load of buckshot to get their attention. Just thought I’d get that out of the way before I move on to today’s column. You still here? Ok, here’s the sitch…  The last month has been so bizarre even Wes Craven wouldn’t have used it as a plot. It wasn’t just me ~ everyone was having a bad time of it as well. By BAD I mean in the, “Excuse me Mr. Hightower, there’s a few icebergs out there. Maybe the Captain would like to change the Titanic’s course a wee bit!” sense of BAD. The Cheat Sheet version is that they managed to find something else wrong with me (and I would have bet The Farm THAT was a statistical improbability, ya think!), Dan’s folk’s had a car die, bought a new one which some ijit felt compelled to side swipe in a major way and the AC at their house died. FYI AC in Florida IS NOT a luxury! Then there are the Doctors, the Hillsborough County Health System and Social Workers! Oh My! (Wizard of Oz ref there in case you missed it.) All of the latter have apparently decided that being Disabled and Homebound isn’t enough of a challenge. I guess they’re getting in the Spirit of the Summer Olympics because they felt they had to add a new degree of difficulty into staying alive.  (Note: This is another long one so feel free to go get a something to drink and play a little background music if you want it. LOL e/cf)  Anyone who’s been reading me for a while knows that I harp a bit on knowing your own Personal Governmental Food Chain. Here’s a good example of WHY that’s so IMPORTANT. I am on Medicare because of my Disability(ies). Now, for reasons I have yet to figure out, they can determine that you are too sick to work BUT they have never made the connection that said illness(es) may actually REQUIRE Prescription Drugs. NOOO! They don’t cover those ~ sorry ‘bout your Luck! Now, many years ago, when I was still part of the Real World, the voters of my county added a penny per dollar to the Gas Taxes we pay at the Gas Station. I was one of those who voted, YES ~ thank the Deity of your choice here. Now, at that time, I had plenty of Insurance, of the Epic Variety- Life, Health, Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability- you name it and I had it. However, the purpose of us VOLUNTARILY paying another Tax was to provide Health Services to people who had jobs without Health Insurance. (FYI they are called the Working Poor. A revolting predicament in a Country as wealthy as ours ~ but a reality none-the-less! Also a reality that hacked me off and continues to hack me off in a MAJOR way!)  Everyone loves to talk about how backward the South is BUT we are the ONLY County in all the States of the great USA to come up with such a Plan. We have Teams come from all over the States and a few other Countries to see how we did and how we’ve managed to keep it going through Economic Ups and Downs for almost 20 years. However, being a Bureaucracy we do get the occasional ‘lifer’ who wants everything in triplicate AND still manages to ‘lose’ your papers so you get to relive the Nightmare. But, as we all know, Bureaucrats are Multi-Regional. They may also breed by Spontaneous Generation but the Jury is still out on that one!  Now since Medicare will pay for Doctor’s Visits, Tests and Hospitalizations I only use that part of the County Plan that covers Prescriptions. Like any other Social Programme you have to jump through a few hoops of fire, drain off a pint or two of blood AND promise them either your first-born or (as in my case) your cat. Which I have no problems with in theory. However, they did away with Homebound Social Workers I knew tough times were ahead and I purchased a Phone/Fax Machine so that I could send them the required information and avoid The Drama. They, however, have decided that was too easy. So, in the spirit of screwing over those who are in my situation they have decided that actually telling you when your Papers expire ISN’T in their job description. The current means of notification involves going to get said medicines and having the Pharmacist tell you that you are no longer covered by the Plan!  (Before you ask, yes this did happen and no, I am not making it up. I write Non-Fiction because Life is stranger than anything a Fantasy writer could come up with. Forget Hobbits ~ I write about Bureaucrats!)  So there I am at 1:30 in the afternoon, calling to make sure my scripts are ready before the person I PAY to pick them up goes to the Pharmacy only to be told that I was S.O.L. NOW, most people would wig, fall to pieces or both. I, however, called the County Commissioner for my District, who called the Plan Administrator, who called the Supervisor of Social Services, who called my Social Worker and long story short May Day Alerts are bouncing from the Head of one Department to another BECAUSE the Commissioner’s Office is watching them, closely. The Supervisor from Social Services is asking me for directions from the Pharmacy to my house so that he can pick me up a 3 Day supply until my name shows up back on the Computer Roster. All this in 4 ½ hours because the store closes at 6:00pm! He was going to pick them up and deliver them himself and he’s the Boss!  Actually, one of my neighbors was good enough to get them for me. Rest assured that when I finally showed up at the Pharmacy the burning question was, “Who do you have pictures of and what in God’s own sweet Name were they doing?!” To which I replied, say it with me Folks!, “FOOD CHAIN!!!”  Of course that pesky V.O.C./N.C.G. (Voice of Conscience and Nice Catholic Girl for our newbies) Syndrome kicks in and I have to work the Chain again. This time to thank them and (gently) remind them that someone less familiar with The System, with a tad less Education or with a Language Barrier would have been, for lack of a more delicate expression, FUBAR’ed. A US Navy term equivalent to the Army’s SNAFU that translates as F***ed Up Beyond All Recognition! Because, as I told every rung on the ladder, I have a Rule that I live by that states, “Just because I could get this done by virtue of my experiences in Life only means that it is incumbent upon me to make sure that people who don’t know what I do are not screwed over by their ignorance or inability to irritate the proper Governmental Officials!” I mean, Fair is Fair, right people!  The other thing adding to my Noticeably High Stress Level is that I FINALLY had the Test to begin our “Search and Destroy Mission”. They tell me on May 6th that something is not quite right in my previously ‘Swiss Watch Nether Regions’ and they schedule THE TEST for June 15th!!! Oh no stress there! I was to the “Either tell me I’m dying or get away from me” StressCon 4Stage! Like you wouldn’t? Come on Fellow Campers! You spend 5 or 6 weeks waiting to find out whether you have Cancer or not and then tell me your nerves wouldn’t start to fray around the edges! It’s not like I’m going in for some routine Blood Work! Or something fun, like my regular “Let’s Shove A Huge Needle Up Your Spine Without Anesthetics” Bone Marrow Biopsy!  Now, for those of you who have missed the Medical Drama previously, I have Seizures (amongst other things) and while they are not caused by stress, it does increase their frequency and severity. Towards the end I was ‘out’ more than I was ‘in’ and ALL of my friends and family members got to do the “Pavlov’s Couch Drill” with me at least once. I call it that because it involves me going into ‘Slo Mo’ on the phone or in front of someone and having them repeat, very slowly, “Go-lay-on-the-couch . That’s-right-Elaine- just-go-lay-on-the-C ouch.” If it is someone on the phone it concludes with “And Take the Phone With You!”  I call it “Pavlov’s Couch” because I NEVER remember doing it. I am already ¾s of the way out of it. I have no idea someone is talking at me (because it sure isn’t to me) and yet I WILL go lay down on the Couch. I WILL ALSO take the phone with me, if needed, then I will turn it off BEFORE I lay down. It’s so embarrassing to have to call my Mom or Dan’s up and say, “Did you tell me to lie down earlier/yesterday?” Since it only works with people I trust it’s a short list. If it wasn’t them I move on to D.J., Jennifer, Matt or Susan. The really embarrassing part is tracking down whoever got to listen to me drool on the phone! LMAO Operant Conditioning at it’s finest!  I found out last Tuesday that there are Foreign Bodies growing inside both my Ovaries. The good news is that because I go for those important Exams I mentioned in an earlier column they are relatively small. NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT GO FOR THE EXAMS OR THE TEST YOU FIND OUT WHEN YOUR OVARIES BLOW OPEN LIKE ORVILLE REDDENBACHER’S FINEST! KEEP THAT IMAGE WITH YOU AS YOU GO THROUGH LIFE ~ GOD KNOWS I HOPE YOU’LL NEVER NEED IT! BUT IT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE OR THE LIFE OF SOMEONE YOU LOVE! That is extremely painful, to say the least and possibly life threatening, to say the worst.  The Bad News is 3-Fold and really falls under the UBER Bad News Category. It turns out that the really large thing growing is somewhere in my Abdomen and I have to go back for another Test ~ an Abdominal CT because I can’t drink Contrast Dye. I stop breathing. The Medicine that counteracts that lovely reaction just happens to stop my Heart. Then there’s the fact that I can’t take the Medicine they give you to try and get rid of the Cysts. I will have a Stroke. So, again, long story ~ short they want me to wait 6 weeks and then repeat the Vaginal Ultrasound. Beg Pardon? Is me or does that just mean they’re going to have that much longer to grow? Pardon my language but when in Hell did someone decide that my body was a Petri Dish from Biology 101? Here’s a thought, “GET THEM OUT OF ME YOU IJIT!”  But we took bad to new and dizzying heights this past Thursday and Friday. It is so “Beyond the Pale” that if it hadn’t happened to me I’m not sure that I’d believe it and my life for the past 13 ½ years has been one long Experiment in the Medically Bizarre. We all know I have Pain Issues because along with all the Head Injury and the ‘forty’leven’ other things wrong with me I have degenerative Arthritis in my feet and legs. This means that every step I take feels like it’s over live coals strewn with broken glass.  So, there I am at my Primary’s Office on Thursday discussing all of the above when I tell her that I need her to change my script because it takes 2 Vicodin not one to deal with the Pain. She decides she can’t do this without consulting a Specialist. Now, I have known this woman for 12 years. During the past 3 of it I have endured Dan’s death, paralyzing my right arm in a fall, major surgeries to give me back partial use of it, 2 Invasive Staph Infections that had to be cut out so they wouldn’t spread and last year I was in the Hospital 3 times. Once because they were thinking of cutting my left leg off below the knee, once in Cardiac ICU and once because my previous Pain Medicine wigged and decided to shut my Peristaltic System down. I don’t want to leave without the script because I am going to run out and the Pharmacy is closed on the weekends. I finally left when I realized that if I stayed around I was going to become unpleasant about it. Keep in mind that my Dan used to tell people with pride, “She scares skinheads! They clean up their act fast whenever she’s around!” So my idea of unpleasant probably is a bit more extreme than the average person’s.  To cap off my week she finally calls me back at 4:00pm on Friday and tells me that she hasn’t called me in a script but she’s got an appointment for me with ANOTHER Pain Management Specialist next Wednesday! AND the goniff is in New Port Richey which is on the other side of Tampa Bay and a good hour’s drive from here IF I could drive. Needless to say, I am NOT happy. I patiently (Pardon the Pun!) reminded her that I was going to be out of Pain Meds and what was I supposed to do in the Interim?  That’s when I heard the First Place Winner in the “Stupidest Thing Someone Has Said to Me In My Entire Life Time Award”. Her helpful suggestion based on a Degree in Medicine and many years of Practice was…  “WELL, YOU COULD TAKE TYLENOL!”  Excuse me? KILL ME NOW, PLEASE! This is the woman who turfed me out to Pain Management who had me on 20mgs of Morphine 4 times a day for 5 years. The drug I quit at home and Cold Turkey even though they told me it was Medically Impossible to do so? She’s got issues writing a script for Vicodin when she wrote them for Morphine for years? Not wanting to either vent or have the back of my head just blow completely off I took a deep breath before my reply.  “Forgive me for appearing blunt, but don’t you think that after all the Specialists you’ve had me see over the years, the one’s who had me on Morphine, that it’s just this side of ludicrous to expect Tylenol to work? Why don’t you just recommend Tic-Tacs? They’d have about the same Medicinal Value and at least I’d have fresh breath while I’m writhing in Pain!”  She said she would call me before the Pharmacy closed at 6:00pm on Friday with something to use over the weekend.  I’m still waiting. As I stated under Mood ~ I DON’T WANT TO BE NEAR ME!  I’ve missed you guys! More tomorrow and Keep the Faith!
