      This is quite interesting...   ...hm...  ...so you all can really just read whatever thoughts I deem worthy of posting on here? That's pretty darn nifty :> I'd even go so far as to say that it's nifterz...  ...and yes... ...nifterz is much better than nifty...  ...kind of like the awesomer version of awesome... ...*nods*...  ...yes that's it...  ...funny to think that the only reason i've got one of these is cuz I adore a bloke in the U.K. and i couldn't post anyfin without having an account...  ...yes... ...that's right Eddie... ...*points at Eddie... ...I'm blaming you!  lol...  ...alright...  ...well... ...um... ...yea... ...i'm gonna go now... ...*waves*... bye! xxxx

      Alright... I've had a conversation with a "friend of a friend" and so on and so forth.. and i thought i should share it with the world, or at least post it... anywho.. seeing as how it involved me in all my sleep deprived glory.. sharing my wit with with the world :> yes.. yes.. i know.. i know.. i'm brilliant.. you needn't tell me.. I already know.. wow.. i really should be a bit more narcisistic.. I feel as tho i'm letting everyone down with my modesty... tis a true shame.. *shrugs* ah well.. onto the conversation:  (oh... the person named Robyn is me... this was done on Yahoo.. as much as I dont' like it... and it wasn't my account... so yea.. take that you fiends! ... erm... yes.. I'm Robyn.. and well.. Dusty.. is.. Dusty... *nods*)  Robyn: robyn is taking a nap on my bed Dusty: lol, poor dear must be tired Robyn: she is... i've been keeping her up much too late... Robyn: ::s Dusty: do i even want to know how or why you have been doing that? Robyn: um.. yesh? Robyn: (a) Robyn: damn yahoo... faces don't work the same Robyn: we've been playing video games Dusty: that makes good sense Robyn: i like it Dusty: what game(s) dare i ask? Robyn: dance dance revolution Dusty: LOL Robyn: what's so funny about that? Robyn: actually.. you should see robyn.. it's freakin' hilarious! Dusty: just something on this end Robyn: muh huh Dusty: just one of the guys i know from class does that a lot Robyn: oh man.. it's SO addictive... Robyn: terrible really... Dusty: So i am told Robyn: it's like... you play the same damn song over and over again.. cuz you HAVE to get a higher score.. Robyn: it's like.. finding ur next fix... Robyn: horrible! and well.. not that i'd know from personal experience.. but ah well *shrugs* Dusty: was going to ask Dusty: and i am glad my mind is not too perverted as of yet Robyn: yea.. sure... you've totally turned robyn... Robyn: she's terrible! Robyn: she makes me wonder about her sanity a lot of the time.. Robyn: :s Dusty: i somehow doubt she is that bad and that is was all me too Robyn: no no dear... i can say something COMPLETELY innocent.. and i turn around, and she's laughing her head off and blushing... Robyn: she blames you *shrugs* Dusty: *chuckles softly* glad to know i still have it; bad to know it rubbed off so bad and my father is even worse Robyn: oh dear lord.. Robyn: *shakes her head8 Robyn: * Dusty: he is one of the sickest type of people on the plannet; a med tech- not only somoene who writes computer code but also used to do autopsies and such Robyn: dear sweet jebus! Robyn: *cringes in terror* Dusty: count your blessings i have only done the code Robyn: *one.. two...thr..no wait.. that's not a blessing... ok.. three... four... fi..what the hell?* Dusty: *chuckles softly* be glad i have only written code and not done the other half Robyn: that would creep me out a bit.. Robyn: okay.. so a lot.. but you know what i mean.. Robyn: i hope.. Dusty: i think so Dusty: considering had i followed that path i would probably have been close to med school by now Robyn: true... very true... Robyn: robyn says that i'm not sane Dusty: does Robyn even say i am sane? Robyn: um.. Robyn: yesh Robyn: *nods* Robyn: wait.. Robyn: no.. Dusty: ok... Robyn: i'm thinking Robyn: i'm tired, and my brain is working like an ADHD kid on crack Dusty: LOL, i don't want to even know how you know about that Robyn: i don't to be honest.. just sounded like an apt description Robyn: *nods* Robyn: i'm completely incoherant half of the time.. just ask robyn... i tend to jump from topic to topic.. i'd say about 10 times a minute... Dusty: uh huh sure; just like i am such a naughty man Robyn: well according to robyn.. Robyn: ooh! she sent your postcard today... Dusty: ok Robyn: did she tell you about it? Dusty: vaugely Robyn: bwa ha ha.. it's stewie... i love that kid...*ruffles stewie's hair* Dusty: Be aware; in a few years i could end up as Stewie only grown Robyn: that'd be awesome! Robyn: good think you like me... i want my death to be quick and painless when you rule the world Dusty: i rarely do painless deaths; since usually it means you crossed me and that is NEVER wise Robyn: but.. but.. stewie is SO much nicer than you! Robyn: :'( Robyn: Dusty: only if you have not crossed him Robyn: but see.. i don't force people to eat broccoli Robyn: so it works out Dusty: indeed; then again i actually like it Robyn: me too... Robyn: so tis a shame that nobody else.. (excluding you of course given the information you've just provided) does. Dusty: which info is that that you speak of? Robyn: that you like the miniature green trees humans tend to call... broccoli.. yes i believe that's what it is.. *nods* Dusty: indeed; be warned may be forced to feed it to you like mad Robyn: bwa ha ha! Robyn: wait.. no that's not right... it's ha ha ha Robyn: *nods* Dusty: lol Robyn: i'm trying to get my account to let me change my profile.. but msn has a large douglas fir up it's arse.. and won't let me have the sufficient amount of characters i need to supply the world with my undying wit! Robyn: Dusty: MSN is often behind the times Robyn: indeed.. *glares at msn.. and for the hell of it... at the douglas fir as well* Robyn: what the hell was that tree thinking taking a nap up there? Dusty: because it deisred to and i have learned arguing with tresss usually results in bad things happening Robyn: really now.. *shant argue with her tree anymore* Robyn: *pets her tree* ur such a good tree... Dusty: i usually don't go that far but whatever works Robyn: well.. my tree seemed lonely... with robyn snoring next to it and all... Dusty: that makes some sense; also remember i am used to desert shrubs and shuch Dusty: such* Robyn: true.. true.. you poor deprived.. man? yes i believe that's what i've been told you are Robyn: Dusty: *chuckles softly* deprived of what? Robyn: trees mate.. trees Robyn: but mom sez i've gotta be going Robyn: speak to you later xxxx Dusty: will do and sleep well Robyn: thankee Robyn: bye *waves*

I'm quite sleep deprived, and am currently getting by on mentos breath mints, and chocolate milk... oh, and i also think that whoever decided to have time zones.. is a bloody MORON! and the night shift.. that was a terrible idea if i've ever heard of one.. but whoever thought of mixing chocolate with milk.. well *praises the ground they walk on* who needs sleep! i have MENTOS! :> um... i think sleep is over-rated... and you know what? burgers are overpriced... i know.. i sell them *nods* *i'm gonna sing the doom song now.. doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom.... DOOM doom doom doom.. doomey doomey doom.. the end* ffs... gir is the best! :> "how did you run out of fuel so fast?"      "i emptied it" "YOU EMPTIED IT!? WHY?!?!?!?!"
