       i know i've been really crappy in the previous entries..so i'll keep this as short as possible...  geez..i don't think i'm psychic..just that perhaps i guess it's some sort of gut feeling..some sort of intuitive emotion that seems to be incredibly accurate. It really is quite impeccable, this feeling of mine...the other time..couple of weeks ago...i just thought that something would happen...i knew it was impossible...but somehow it stuck to my mind and i couldn't get it out of my mind. It just clung on for the rest of the day...until nighttime when i realised that it really occurred. This has been the case of various incidents over the past weeks..it really is quite amazing.  Just a couple of days ago...on saturday afternoon..it suddenly occurred to me that sweden and the dutch would draw in a match 0-0..and the dutch would finally triumph in penalties...though i wasn't able to predict the penalty score ultimately. However, i woke up the next morning i found that it was exemplified by reality! Just today..i wanted to wake up at 330 to catch the czech-danish encounter..but well i just kept slacking on bed..but somehow perhaps in my dreams or something like that(was in a state of sub-consciousness) i predicted that czechs had won 3-0. Somehow something told me that rosicky score. OMG. czechs won 3-0. but rosicky didnt' score. geez. this is getting more and more freaky.   I promised myself i won't let this astnoshing occurrence, even if it does recur, to help me with placing bets or something along those lines...and perhaps it may just break the entire "chain of thought" that has been coming to me. Perhaps i just want to preserve the beauty of it...and perhaps find out why it has been coming to me...and allow even more miracles to happen.   Perhaps my MSN nick that i had displayed couple of weeks ago was true..." If you really want something, everything in the world will conspire in your favour to achieve it."  Whether you believe anything or everything in the preceding paragraphs..it's all up to you. =)

       Oh man...LP totally rocks! Wouldn't say the 85 bucks spent was entirely worth the performance, considering much improvisation could be made to make the performance much much better, and some people could even enjoy the music despite not paying a single cent.  Ah well, caught up with Jon at orchard first to watch around the world in 80 days...another typical jackie chan movie...filled with innovative ideas to stir laughter among audiences around the world, and non-stop action. It was kinda cool seeing all the various stars guest-starring for the movie, but well, didn't think it was THAT good...think i've watched too many jackie chan movies...kinda know how things turn out in his movies..so well...didn't find it that intriguing.  John smsed me at 6+ and told me that was already a huge crowd of people at the padang, so Jon and I rushed down to city hall, and tried to get dinner. omg..15 minutes lapsed as we were queueing up to wait for our turn at BK, but we were still waiting for our turn...damn...guess almost everyone at BK was buying dinner and were going down for the LP concert. At around 720, it was such a long queue stretching all the way from the main entrances all the way along the pavement to just outside SRC. So well, we crossed the road from Raffles city, and i told Jon to join the queue while i checked out if we were in the correct queue..ahah..realised that some singaporeans aren't that smart...they notice a queue they'll just join it. Popped up at the entrance which caused the long queue, realised that he was in the wrong queue, that entrance was only for ppl who purchased 150 dollar tix. The queue for the 85 dollar tix was so short..we got in only in a matter of 5 minutes. It was kinda lame, saw Denise from MTV going up to ppl asking them to sing linkin park songs and stuff...man..she's real thin. But very hot... =p  Saw so many people crowding near the front..especially John and 4F ppl...i went to check out the view from their perspective...i don't think they could even see the stage properly...lol...so Jon and I went towards the back to sit down on the grass...wow. We had a good view of the stage and pleasant ventilation as well. lol.  man..we waited all the way till 820 when Dan and Sheikh from perfect 10 came in to attempt to kick things off and get the crowd all psyched up and stuff. So well, they introduced this korean band, which LP probably admires, cuz they invited the korean band to start things off..oh man..we paid 87 bucks not to watch some korean band..but LINKIN PARK!!! Geez..everyone around was like shouting "Go back to seoul!!! Go home!!!" Don't think we were too evil... =) They performed till about 850...and everyone around were eagerly anticipating for LP to finally get on stage and rock the house. But crap...they shua da pai...didn't come out till bout 920..but well...they really kicked things off quite well..getting the entire crowd on their feet, enjoying the music , dancing to the beat of the music.  It was quite fantabulous..15000 ppl(that's wat dan ong said) in one voice...dancing, singing in one voice..and everyone hopping up and down, flailing their arms tirelessly, going delirious, enjoying a performance put up by one of the greatest bands in the world in unison. It was damn cool...i was bouncing up and down like i was walking on fire, but in fact i wasn't..i was having one of the greatest times in my life..i was on the verge of losing my voice..but ah...heck cared...and i continued to attempt to sing...i finally realised what's the diff between going to a rock concert and just watching the show on tv or just listening to their music...it's something that cannot be experienced unless you actually go for the concert. It's a glorious feeling...blending in with the crowd...and being with so many hardcore enthusiasts...and being part of the concert itself. Or perhaps it's just with LP...shall quote lyndsey..."LP have got amazing stage presence.." I can't agree more...  Wow, the concert was really uber-good..perhaps only for the last 90 minutes or so...haha...the crowd was kept well captivated in a sense of ecstasy, exuberance, exhilaration, and exhaltation. LP made us seem like WE were the stars of the concert, not them.   Parents made me leave just one song earlier...but i managed to catch it on my way out...and i heard the entire gig ending.. OMG..i saw the entire pavement across the road...just outside St Andrew's Cathedral filled with swarms of people, all listening to LP...for FREE. wat the hell...really couldn't believe it...there were people on the grass just listening...ppl on city hall steps trying to take a glance...wow...LP is really quite fantastic...Got onto the train just before the main crowd got to city hall...so i'm considered quite fortunate i guess..haha..  LP's really incredible..they totalled rocked singapore on 22nd June!!! LP rocks!

       Oh man, haven't been able to do anything productive or create something out of nothing these days...basically been having tonsa fun..damn..i betta get out of this hole before i fall any deeper and get back on the right track..  Woah, for the first time in my life, i actually did something for my dad on father's day. How ironic isn't it...on father's day my dad gave me two items..a shaver and a battery charger..man..they amounted to about 100++ bucks...so well...didn't really feel entirely well about the entire situation...   Anyways, shall digress for a moment..thought using a shaver would be pretty easy..so kinda tried experimenting...well yeah...actually did pretty well..but after that the area just above the mouth didn't feel too comfortable...the area became crimson red as well. Argh..it's fine now..but i don't think i'm gonna try doing something like this in the near future..haha..so to all greenhorn shavers out there(whereever you shave =p)...do take extra caution and be careful...you don't wanna end up like dumb me here.  Something didn't exactly feel right..perhaps it was my conscience...if i do have one..so well i decided to extract part of my angbao money and treat dinner for the rest of the family that night..haha..dad felt pretty good about it..so did everyone else...and i was on the receiving end of appreciation..haha..it was pretty cool...though i spent quite a large sum of money...guess it was worth every penny...  Woke up yesterday morning to find out that spain lost, and so did greece. However, greece fortuitiously got in due to scoring more goals than spain. I don't think this is a really good rule..cuz spain scored less goals but also conceded less goals than greece...so oyeah...guess lady luck wasn't on spain's side. But the blame has to go to Spain, there was substandard marking and defending all throughout the game, they didn't show the drive and determination that got them thus far, and they were looking like they were playing with each other for the first time in their lives. They have one of the most impressive looking squads in the world, sometimes capable of scintillating displays of football, but guess they've under-achieved yet again.  Had to wake up real early cuz i was going to "Wild Wild Wet" with my dear nephews and niece who are returning to the states tomorrow. Got there at around 10, and the queue was already considerably long. But we still managed to get in after a short wait, guess the staff there were pretty effecient about doing their stuff, got in eventually and had to change and stuff. Geez. My younger nephew and niece are really cute...they keep trying to hold my hand and bring me somewhere..and cuz i was carrying my stuff on one hand...they had to fight for my other hand...lol. Eventually their mum, my cousin-in-law, who is pregnant once again, suggested that she hold my stuff while i hold their hands and look after them..lol.   Popped up in the main area, their mum said my cousin and I could go for the adult rides on our own first..so well..we did. We went to this gigantic v-shaped object where we saw people sliding down one side of the V at uber-high velocity, cuz the v shape, one one side was about 70 degrees from the ground. Got our float, which was meant for 2 persons, and well soon it was our turn...and woah..it was really really fun. It was an exhilarating experience, sliding down at such a high speed...something like a roller coaster...haha...so we went down the 70 degree side, and went up the other side of the V shape, and down again, and up for a couple of times. It wasn't exactly spine-chilling, but my butt hurt after the ride...cuz of abrasion with the ground...argh...  Went for a couple more rides and slides,but the first one was the most fun...haha...just that the repercussions weren't exactly much appreciated by most of the guests...haha..it was pretty evident...lol.  So came babysitting, i had to take care of the younger nephew, and he kept bugging me to go with him on the slides, which he eventually had the courage to do it on his own..haha..he's only 4 years old by the way..lol..and i had to carry him up so he could activate one of those water-shooting devices, and he didn't get tired of them until after donkey years...so well..my arm got so sore after that it started trembling in the later part of the day.   Now i know how my mum, and all mums felt when bringing up their children. I wouldn't say it's frustrating..though it can get quite exasperating at times...but it really is exhausting both physically and mentally. But well, being with them is a feeling that cannot be expressed..this is an area where language founders at sea.  Wasn't really that exhausted when i got home, so when to st. ignatius to play football with clement..found that my crossing is pretty good now..haha..oh well..it was really fun..just catching up and playing 1v1 and stuff..even though the father tried to chase us away..i quote him " You kenna my glass window u pay ah!" But well, guess it didn't pull off...lol..played 1 half hours of soccer...was really shagged after that...but still woke up this morning to watch england win croatia...damn...i really want the underdogs to prevail this time round..they almost did...the swiss and the croats...it was a gallant effort to fight for pride..couple of nice goals as well. Rooney impressed yet again...now it's become 9 goals in 10 international games for him. I have to say...that's a brilliant record. Hands down to him..but i guess he has to watch his attitude sometimes...  Sorry for yet another loooong and draggy entry..but well...feeling real crappy now..gonna go watch lp live at padang tonite..=)  Just to end off..this is something interesting i got From MountainWings..these excerpts are based on true experiences...and the stories are first hand accounts of experiences of what they would call "MountainWings moment"  "Sit down so that I can take off your shoes," I said.  He calmly sat down on the floor and held out his feet.  That's no big deal except for one small fact.  The person whom I was talking to was Christian, our 18-month-old son.  He can't talk, at least not legible enough for anyone to understand.  He can say Mama, Daddy, and Robbie (his babysitter) but that's the full extent of his comprehensible vocabulary. Everything else is just unintelligible grunts.  So what's so special about Christian sitting down and holding out his feet?  He understood what he himself can't put into words.  Kids understand what they may not be able to articulate.  They understand tones, emotions and whether something is said in love or frustration.  They can't spell bitterness... but they understand it. They can't spell anger... but they understand it. They can't spell hate... but they understand it. They can't spell resentment... but they understand it. They can't spell not being wanted... but they understand it.  Neither can they spell love...      but they understand it. They can't spell concern...         but they understand it. They can't spell patience...        but they understand it. They can't spell sacrifice...       but they understand it. They can't spell "I put you over my own needs..."                                     but they understand it.   You would be surprised what kids who can't articulate their feelings, reactions and thoughts, understand.  The adults around you often can't or won't articulate their feelings either.  And just like kids, you'd be surprised what they understand.

       lol haven't blogged for the past few days 'cos of procrastination and i got pretty pissed with the blog and stuff...crap...had been fiddling with the jukebox for about 3 days and it's still not working...dammit..i've had it...now i think my com's been infected with a virus as well...argh...   Thursday   I simply hate some people who want to play soccer yet they themselves do not want to take the initiative to just get out of their beds and just come out to play. Don't think it's that much of a hassle isn't it? Asked 10++ people out to play soccer in school...ultimately only 4 turned up(including me). Yeah, it's really pathetic. we played 2v2 and were tired of it just 30 minutes later. It was really exhausting 'cos we were running our heads off in the blistering heat.   Ah well. popped up at coro later and played an hour or warcraft 3(first time in 2 months)..lol. Couldn't help but get thrashed by the professional. hah. Went hien's house to slack, both of us were insistent on watching "breaking news"..but the movie wasn't showing at west mall..so we had to go all the way to west mall. He only wanted to go 'cos Vincent was going since he said watching with another guy was too sian. Took the MRT all the way to orchard...damn...my injured tailbone was hurting even more.   We were late for about 20 minutes..lol..but well..still managed to get 3rd last row seats...and found out that those seats weren't that fantastic after all. The show's really quite captivating, there's non-stop action and a beautiful actress. hahaha..teetered to borders later...vin and hien checked out comics while i trudged towards orchard emerald. En route i inadvertently saw michelle chia(just in case u didn't know she's the actress cum model for lux or sth like that). she was doing some promotion or something along those lines...or perhaps just signing autographs. Didn't have a good glance, but i don't think she's that pretty.hah.  Ah well..had tuition till 10++, really tired after a long day...  I don't think there's anything worth mentioning about Friday...so i'll just give it a miss...   Saturday   I'm sure even a toddler would know when he's playing with fire, right? But well, incidentally a 63-year-old Italian sure has proven his ignorance concerning the matter. Actually i'm not sure bout his exact age..lol..but well..the guy in question is Italian national team manager Giovanni Trapattoni(otherwise known as trap).   Geez. I don't think there's anyone as foolish as him. He's really as dumb as a dodo. Anxiety really built up towards the commencement of the Italian-Swedish encounter, since the Swedes thumped the Bulgarians 5-0 in their opening game. Mr. Francesco Totti was clever enough to clear his throat at a dane, hence i guess u could say it paid dividence. He's banned for three matches. Oh well, turned on the tv and saw del piero and cassano and gattuso giving 101 percent on the playing field. And woah. the italians were playing the best football i've seen in a long time. They put up a prolifically astute performance, defending with outstanding purpose and tenacity, attacking with real aggresiveness and willpower. They were playing free-flowing football, the sweetest a football fan could ever enjoy. hah. I almost woke up everyone when cassano scored...lol..i was exhilarated...going at the top of my voice "hurrah italy!!!"   Italy simply looked to be an impregnable force, with Nesta and Cannavaro marshalling the defence, and probably the best goalkeeper in the world Buffon in between the posts. But well, anything is possible. TRAP took off Gattuso, well i understand that 'cos he was yellow-carded..and he himself wanted to be taken off. But he took off Del Piero and Cassano. Three of the best players for Italy were off! Three other players were on, giving substandard displays of football. My heart was in my mouth when the Italian defence was exposed time after time, subject to intense pressure from the Swedes who seemingly had 4 strikers. This paid dividence. Italy seemed to have lost the drive to go forward, with Vieri still in poor form, and not the most creative midfielders on the pitch. When Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored, i was surprised my jaw didn't drop to the floor. Oh my god.. it was a simply sensational goal...both nesta and cannavaro fell flat on the floor 'cos of previous challenges made, and the ball was in the penalty area bouncing out of control. Suddenly Zlatan just leaped forward and back-flicked it, and the ball flew high into the air, dipping down just beneath the crossbar and above vieri's head into the goal. OUTRAGEOUS. Italians tried to go forward again with the ever-impresive zambrotta, but Isaksson wasn't gonna let anything past him. So it ended 1-1.   Crap. This means that Italy definitely have to win Bulgaria by at least 2 goals, and they have to hope they receive some help from their Scandinavian rivals, Denmark and Sweden, and hope against all hope that somehow they match does not end up a high-scoring draw (2-2 and more). Otherwise all Italian hope of getting further in the tournament will be washed down the drain. With cannavaro, gattuso, zambrotta, and totti all suspended, it will be a tough match, and the bulgarians will not go quietly into the night without getting anything from the tournament.   Geez. Just read soccernet, gattuso defended trapattoni, saying he would have done the same, and he supported the substitutions that he had made. oh god. Are all italians the same? I seriously hope otherwise. However, it's good to hear that Sweden's coach assured the Italians that they'll go all out for the win. Hopefully either Denmark or Sweden emerge victorious and not end up honours even.  Ah well, that's too much rambling for soccer i guess..haha..well..went for pool yesterday with jon...can't believe it. I got the white ball in together with the black ball for 3 times...otherwise i would have thrashed him upside down..urgh...ah well..doesn't matter now anyway.  Dear nephews and niece came over to my place last nite for the last time during their trip, haha...they're darn cute...forever trying to offer food to people..and for some unapparent reason i always seemed to be in favour...haha...but damn..i've got to do some babysitting when i accompany them to "Wild Wild wet" on Monday...crap..i haven't completed my homework yet...  Just gotten news that Germany drew with latvia!!!ahhh!!! luckily i didn't bet with jon..otherwise would have lost 10 bucks...lol...but well i was right that czechs would win netherlands!!! haha...goodbye advocaat and ur dutch team!!

       Now that she's back in the atmosphere  With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey  She acts like summer and walks like rain  Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey  Since the return from her stay on the moon  She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey   Tell me did you sail across the sun  Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded  And that heaven is overrated   Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star  One without a permanent scar  And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there   Now that she's back from that soul vacation  Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey  She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo  Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey   Now that she's back in the atmosphere  I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane  Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet  Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day  And head back to the Milky Way  And tell me, did Venus blow your mind  Was it everything you wanted to find  And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there   Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken  Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong  Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation  The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet  Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day  And head back toward the Milky Way  'tis a beautiful song, but the lyrics are kinda incomprehensible i suppose. lol.

       well well well, after such a long period of procrastination, this blog has finally materialised. Not to mention, couple of friends'(you know who ;)) perpetual prompts have made me get this blog rollin'. Anyway, I'm still in the midst of seeking some help to make the blog look more presentable, so just bear with this in the meantime. By the way, just a little note to end this exceedingly short first entry, any comments or rantings that are made are purely an avenue for me to express my personal distress over a certain preoccupation, and I don't mean to demean anyone in the process. That's what a blog's supposed to be for in the first place, isn't it?  ciao.  P.S this will be probably the first and last time such a formal entry will be showcased on this url. =)

       I'm lying alone with my head on the phone Thinking of you till it hurts I know you're hurt too but what else can we do, tormented and torn apart I wish I could carry your smile in my heart For times when my life seems so low It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you I know you were right believing for so long I'm all out of love, what am I without you? I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong I want you to come back and carry me home Away from these long lonely nights I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too Does the feeling seem oh so right And what would you say if I called on you now And said that I can't hold on There's no easy way, it gets harder each day Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone... I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you I know you were right believing for so long I'm all out of love, what am I without you? I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong Oh, what are you thinking of? What are you thinking of? What are you thinking of? What are you thinking of? I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you I know you were right believing for so long I'm all out of love, what am I without you? I can't be too late I know I was so wrong I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you I know you were right believing for so long I'm all out of love, what am I without you? I can't be too late I know I was so wrong I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you I know you were right believing for so long I'm all out of love, what am I without you? I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

I'm amazed no one in class phoned woodbridge and asked for me to be sent into the institution straight away. lol...i was laughing like crap..for no reason...and i was laughing in a really laughable manner...lol...i have no idea how i was doing that...but i really seemed like a lunatic i guess...and i started singing...it seemed as if i was inebriated...haha...i tried to sing worse than jonny...lol...which isn't quite tough 'cos i was having a bad sore throat...lol...i think my sicknesses have deserted me..lol..i guess it's all psychological..rocksed man...still having a slight cough..but i think the major effect has worn off...lol...lalala...  anw...sorry to everyone who i have hurt in anyway today...haha...especially aiks...hehe..i won't say i accidentally pushed him off his chair..but i dare say i did it inadvertently...haha..cuz i didn't think i had the&nbsp;strength to shove him off his chair..haha...sorry...and jon...haha...sorry to you too...and everyone who thought i was being a total nutcase who even went more bonkers than one could ever be...sorry i disrupted any train of thought or something along those lines...haha..i hope i return to my normal form soon enuff..in order to prevent more destruction from taking place...  -If you read this...you may be going through a tough time...but whatever it is i'll respect your decision...i'll be waiting...

       All I know Is everything is not as it's sold but the more I grow the less I know And I have lived so many lives Though I'm not old And the more I see, the less I grow The fewer the seeds the more I sow  Then I see you standing there Wanting more from me And all I can do is try Then I see you standing there Wanting more from me And all I can do is try  I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness And all the real people are really not real at all The more I learn, the more I learn  The more I cry, the more I cry As I say goodbye to the way of life I thought I had designed for me  Then I see you standing there Wanting more from me And all I can do is try Then I see you standing there I'm all I'll ever be But all I can do is try Try  All of the moments that already passed We'll try to go back and make them last All of the things we want each other to be We never will be And that's wonderful, and that's life And that's you, baby This is me, baby And we are, we are, we are, we are Free In our love We are free in our love

       crap man...feeling so damn miserable now...it's pretty uncommon...'cos fri's actually one of my favourite days of the week..zzz...i think i'm running a fever...been having a flu since last nite...*sniffs*  had assembly yesterday...wah...edmund teo was invited to give us a talk regarding suicide. riiight. Some people would know who comes to mind when this notion springs up...lol...it's been a long time since it happened...probably there was a possibility then...we thought he didn't have the guts..obviously he didn't do it...but well...we'll never know if it'll ever happen until the time comes...woah..edmund teo's a really charismatic speaker...he has fantastic diction and is quite interactive with the audience...can tell he's a really good mentor as well...really cool guy man.   Aiya...seriously...we should really watch out for one another since you might never know what may happen...like what i said in my previous entry(i think) we gotta treasure everything that we have that is with us..cuz we never know when they might just disappear some day. Shall not regurgitate everything that edmund teo said...but just to say a little to those outside of tchs and probably those who haven't heard of it...misconceptions are that only insane people and irrational sociopaths harbour thoughts of suicide and it isn't that huge a problem. Well seriously from what i saw it was...the one who gets most hurt is the person who wants to commit suicide...the most prevalent of causes is loneliness...and perhaps ending one's journey of seeking the meaning of life...he just wants to leave...but seriously think of it...when they are here..still with us...they are the most hurt...but after they've left this world...we may probably think that they would hopefully be coping well on the other side...but we know that at the end of the day it is ourselves that hurt the most with the loss of these loved ones and friends. I used to take suicide as something to be ludicrous...'cos i know i would never commit it...but i think now my perception has changed...well perhaps not of suicide...but perhaps of life...whatever it is i'll always try my best to achieve something...if i fail...so be it..i guess...hah...we should live a life happily...we probably only get one chance to live...so once we regret it we'll feel remorse for the rest of our lives...at least i know i tried my best to achieve happiness...i know it doesn't come for granted and it's something that is mutual...=)  Oh well...talking bout people getting hurt...hsien got knocked on the head by my sepak takraw when hien volleyed or sth the ball at his head...and omg...i can't talk much bout it...but it accentuated a previous injury was suffered when he was much younger...now he has some sort of an incapacity...shan't talk much bout it...but seriously we won't know whether it's temporary or permanent...hais...i'm feeling bad cuz i brought the sepak takraw to sch...but of course i didn't expect for such things to occur...zzz...how many times have i got to tell you guys do not vent all your frustration or exert all your energy on the ball...it's only made of rattan.zzz. now it's on the verge of rupturing.zzz. so for all of you guys who read this...pls...do be more delicate with the ball...  won't say it's hien's fault la..accidents are bound to happen...hais. Mr "introvert" hsien was such a lively dude in school..never failing to conjure some magic to inject laughter into the class during times of boredom...he's kinda eccentric at times la...but he's a real nice guy actually...i know that even though i've only known him for bout 1 and a half year or so 'cos there were a few incidents from which we became better friends. He was picking up the momentum(as ang put it) and it's really unfortunate that something like this has happened.hais. Wish him all the best.  Get well soon dude. Hope to see you back in school in no time!  wah...ang came in to return maths test today...when aiks msged me to tell me i got 80 obviously i was quite happy la...budden i realised i was still lower than class average..wth man..class did so bloody well...about 20++ people got 80 and above...woah..i guess it wasn't much to be happy about..so ya..anw..i guess i think i deserved it..chem test today was a total. Couldn't say the same for chinese test though. 100 marks paper within 80 mins...wah...i think most people couldn't finish on time...lots of us were struggling...won't say it's very hard...but some of the basic things that i anticipated wouldn't be featured came out...Percentage composition of air!!!wat the hell!!! and no mcq at all...zzz. wah. i almost died sia...i think i left enough blanks that could result in a 10 mark deficit..crap man..shall hope for the best...chinese test was damn easy...cuz i think i dedicated much effort to studying for it...lol..kinda breezed through la...hehe...  Oh well...still sniffing like crap..the mucus just won't stop coming out...i think there's enough mucus to fill one entire mug...ok i shall not stray towards the gruesome side...argh..but crap...it really doesn't feel good...i wanna just get well soon and get out and play some soccer!!!   ^i'm still waiting.

Su came in and gave us some sort of a "spring test" wah crap...totally forgot stuff bout the logic gates...zzz....gotta really brush up on that aspect...played sepak takraw in class for a while...lol..they bonded the two volleyball ppl...for whatever reason..i have no idea. lol. vollyball ppl had betta watch out. Traipsed to auditorium at 9...was supposed to "enjoy" the different cultural dances and "enrich" ourself...i must say the westspring ppl really came well-prepared(for those of you who are unaware...the whole of westspring secondary school was invited to our school in joint celebration of racial harmony..in an bid to help chinese high students understand more bout other cultures..i think..hah.) they performed really well...the chinese high guys who were supposed to collaborate and perform together were the worse performers...seriously...it was utterly embarassing...crap man...i think even william hung would have laughed at 'em. wth man...it was an utter disgrace...tsk tsk...it was a really lackadaisical performance...zzz...  most of us made our way to kah kee hall to check out the sepak takraw ppl...woah...the malays are really skilful...lol..we almost "koped" a sepak takraw ball cuz my own ball was falling out of favour with me.hah. i want a new ball anyway...(sepak takraw that is)  went to play basketball...since we were so bloody bored...wah...in jeans and polo tee...but luckily the weather was quite favourable..it rained in the early morning so it was pretty cooling playing during then..the floor wasn't exactly wet as well...played about 2 hours of bball...wah...crap man..i forgot to clear 2 times...and during the 2 times i shot the basketball and it went in with a "swish"..other than that i wasn't able to achieve success...until when we were about to leave the basketball court..i just randomly shot a three-pointer and it went in through the hoop in sublime style...Zzzzz....  went street court watch ppl play for a while..the usual patronisers of street court were really good...it was an amazing display of football..really cool...den went to watch "remember the titans" in auditorium...woah..it's a really cool movie..denzel washington movie once again...he's really one heck of an actor...the little gal in the movie was fantastic as well...she was damn cute...lol...really mature...in a good way...haha...kinda tomboyish...but she's really charismatic and perpetually seeks fairness...hah...i think it's a really good movie...no doubt one of the best i've enjoyed...the story's bout this afro-american(denzel washington) employed to coach this football team...cuz all of the whites were prevalent in the american football teams...so it caused lotsa dissent...but eventually he brought them together as a team...they did really really well...haha...a perfect season..that's really cool siaz...  geog test after that was quite easy..i think...lol...cuz i was really famished so i guess i didn't really care...i was really craving for some food...zzz...so i just rushed through it..den went kap macs with vin, jon, pzh, low kee guan, shixian, bk, ying quan and wei zhi joined in later..lol...it was hilarious...eating with pzh...lol. wah...seriously...it was most fortunate that we weren't wearing school uniform...lol...we really turned the place around..literally. lol...it was damn funny...now jonny has a new nick..instead of being stinky..he's become zebra. lol.  wah...suddenly we started playing zong ji mi ma...lol..it was damn funny...they started preparing the forfeit...an interesting concoction...mixture of mayonnaise, lettuce, sweet chili sauce, sweet & sour, curry, coke, milo, and a pickle.lol. wah...i heard it tasted really vile. lol. vincent was really really "fortuitious" hah...he tio the number 4 times! so&nbsp;the forfeit was that the person had to dip a french fry into the sauce and&nbsp;consume it...lol..it was damn funny...luckily i didn't tio...wah jonny was quite dumb...zheng hui just anyhow said...aiya...i choose number...to verify he smsed the number to shixian...den he said jonny u start...and since the range was 1 to 500...jonny chose the median number...lol..and tio! hahahaha....that's quite dumb..hehehe..finally we decided that it was gonna be the last time since it was kinda late.so we changed the forfeit. wei zhi tio! hah! he was among the bunch of&nbsp;most unlikely targets! lol. so we proposed 3 options: a) pick a leaf from the tree and consume that leaf, b) stand on the table and sing a song, c) go get a gal's number...wahahaha...vin proposed an alternative...all of the above...lol. so did i...i said that he could pass on all the responsibility to one person...the condition was that the person had to be jonny...lol..but eventually weizhi&nbsp;didn't shirk responsibility la...not like some ppl...lol...he went up at first...wanted to get the ny gal's number...but didn't dare...lol...but after a matter of time and prompting...he did it..he asked for the number when her companion had returned. lol...think the gal was quite nice-looking la...lol..budden she sabo-ed her friend and gave her friend's number...lol...oh well...we left after that...haha..it was hilarious sia...  i heard ying quan called the gal when they were on the bus...lol...the gal(she's called lisa i think..lol...all "lisa"s from ny please be wary...)lol..and her mum picked up the phone..wahaha...den he hung up.lol. and wei zhi just told me...

       wah...despite being a schoolday and a monday...it was quite eventful...lol...i have to say began the day once again by tuning in to morning madness and doing a math test paper...didn't exactly use the duration of 2 hours that ang had set in regulation for us to follow...didn't even spend 1 hour...lol...but i didn't finish the paper la..missed a couple of questions that i had doubts... &nbsp; morning madness seriously rocks. lol. even though i tried calling in 20 times on fri and only once i got through and nobody picked up...they still rock.hah. aiya...dan and sheikh are damn comical...they really liven up your day and set the perfect tune for the perfect start of your day...wahaha...even though i must say sheikh's kinda stagnant at times... &nbsp; wah..triple english today...couldn't stand it man...first period nancy tay had to settle stuff and loke trudged into the class... she's forever not punctual for her lessons. Don't think she regards punctuality as vital as a virtue as compared to ang.lol. ah well...english lessons more or less quite orthodox most of the time...there's this sense of indolence in the class...no one actually listens...and she starts asking ppl to stand up and talk bout something...zZzzz.... &nbsp; PE...height and weight...lol..we got to play soccer first...so ya...having 30 odd people chasing a ball on a field one-quarter the size of a normal football field...isn't exactly the most fascinating game on earth. so ya...odd-number ppl (my team) won 3-0. lol. we didn't have a goalkeeper at all..they didn't even attempt a shot as far as i'm concerned...lol...so well...i don't know why i made a sliding tackle on BK..they said it wasn't worth it. I think so now. argh. now my wound has been exposed once again...and i think it's really prone to getting infected...uh-oh. took height and weight...wah...everyone started laughing when my height was announced...not cuz i'm the shortest in the class cuz i ain't...but cuz i seemed to&nbsp;be the only one who grew taller...lol..lotsa ppl had shrunk i think...or i guess there was something wrong with the tape or sth.. &nbsp; Went back to class to play sepak takraw(is this how u spell it?)...wah...sorry zhao wei..hit u so many times...hah....and anw...we did pretty well...colin was more or less the achilles' heel of our almost perfect juggling transition from one person to the next.hehe. Can i proudly announce myself as the sepak takraw club chairman? hehe....nah...i dun think i deserve that role...hehe... &nbsp; assembly later was almost completely crap and a total waste of time...the first half an hour was wasted listening to crap that didn't in the least concern us. can't believe it...was just ranting...and wongsm was unhappy bout it...wth...mok as usual wasn't exactly much favoured by the audience...it was all the usual crap bout results and stuff we didn't have to know...bout discipline and stuff...i can gather all that easily from the net...zzzz... &nbsp; at least she showed us this really inspiring and astonishing video that featured this person who seemingly only had body parts above the waist. omg..he's hilarious...despite his incapacity...and his deficiencies...he was living life the way he wanted to live life...he was happy bout the way he lived life...attitude made the difference...and he was really stout...his arms were so damn muscular u could compare them to a weight-lifter. i mean...obviously they are strong since he uses them as legs for walking...omg...he really displayed utmost tenacity and resilience...he had a couple of quotes...these are just vague impressions of 'em...: &nbsp; "Live life the way you want to live life...don't let life live you." &amp; "There's always a way to deal with things(or something like that)...underneath..through or over them."(haha sounds crap..i know..my memory ain't that good) &nbsp; can't believe it..wongsm made us write ying yong wen...just when all my composition flair had dried off and my brain had seemingly become desiccated...void of substance...lol. I took quite a long time to write it..longer than usual at least...and omg..last 2 periods loke came in again...wah...write another essay...time trial at the same time...narrative too...i don't quite like narrative...but i think today's work has made me change my impression of 'em. hah. I thought of the movie starring brendan fraser and joe pesci which featured a harvard student helping a bummer and the bummer helping the harvard student and the reverse again...a really touching story...and i altered and condensed the story till it fit the title of "repaying a kindness" haha...i think i lacked some details..but i guess it'll do fine... &nbsp; got back 2 chinese tests...88 and 89...not as good as i expected..(dun come walloping me) cuz i was expecting for 90s...argh...i need to get a high A this term for chinese...oh well...we had to study these sentences and memorise them and regurgitate them&nbsp;during the test&nbsp;this friday..wth man...and we had to made a duplicate of an essay she gave us...wat the hell man...wrote till my fingers became numb...obviously it wasn't an exact replica of the essay...lots of us were just scribbling through and the words simply didn't make much sense due to the sloppy writing...hah. &nbsp; den later wongsm noticed my sepak takraw in the locker..wat the hell man....think she has eyes of her hawk..oh ya...she has 3 pairs of eyes...;) den wth...she confiscated it...and oh well coerced us to make a pact with her...must say i kinda initiated it...cuz i wanted the ball back...that any damage made to the notice board...we would sort of mend back those sheets of vanguard...i think she sorta wanted the entire thing to be refurbished.argh.killing 2 birds with one stone eh. so well...couple of us wrote our names down..and wth...jonny wrote it...under wong's instruction..and said that any damage made to class property including notice board would be our responsibility to recondition the stuff.wat crap man. it's ok..i think other than jonny no one else would be able to comprehend his handwriting...hehe... &nbsp; went to play basketball...wah...scored damn nice shots..hehe...in a very good mood cuz i haven't played in a long time...and the ball dipped in with a ear-pleasing "swish"...hehe...b-e-a-utiful... &nbsp; oh well...i guess attitude matters alot...that's what i've learnt...gotta make the best out of life...we only live life once at least that's what we understand...and opportunities come and go...so gotta make good use of them...whatever happens try to be happy...otherwise one mishap may trigger another...so when the warning signs start flashing...be on your wary and be cautious and handle the issue delicately...dun let it exacerbate till the situation cannot be salvaged. Don't let sad matters get in the way...they are just part of the process that understanding that life is beautiful and we should treasure these beautiful items in life. what's meant to be is meant to be...and i guess timing has to be impeccable for certain issues to really work well. Time controls everything...probably we have to be patient...but we also have to manipulate time in our favour as well. I guess...that's the most i can expect..i can't afford to sink into oblivion and let emotions control my attitude...it should be the other way round...it's an important period of time...and i'll continue to wait...

       The day turned out surprisingly well..lol..in stark contrast to my expectations and the preceding days... &nbsp; woke up at 7 this morning...was kinda late for morning jog cuz i was planning to leave home at 7...but well..the rain woke me up i guess..and i decided to ring up the guys staying up at boarding sch..wanted to know if morning jog was still on...think all of em were still asleep...lol..so i decided to sms ang...and wow..he replied..haha..not that&nbsp;i despise him or wat..just that i didn't expect him to reply so quickly..well of course he said no we didn't have to go to sch cuz of the rain... &nbsp; Hence i began spamming ppl with smses telling 'em that morning jog was cancelled..think my bill's gonna rocket sky high this month..soon ppl began bombarding me with messages..asking me why...and whether i could be trusted and stuff..lol..and omg..it stopped raining at 720..and yingquan ronald and some other peeps told me there was run...just that it would be held later cuz they wanted to wait for the area to sort of dry up... &nbsp; man..i was panicking..not cuz of taking attendance or wat..just that i was in a dilemma..if i went to sch and ran and take attendance and others would i messaged didn't...it's kinda like i would be lying to them and stuff...so ah well...eventually i just went to sch..realising that some ppl i smsed telling them there was no sch...and they sorta said ok and stuff...were in school..so ahh...i got a ride to sch in mum's car...got there...angks told me not to go otherwise i would be punished by doing pushups...not that it's tough or wat..but he said i would be "killed"...zzzz. went to kah kee hall...realised that many ppl did turn up for the event..but i only spotted like less than 5 ppl from class there...lol..den aks asked me to go science block...didn't expect to see 8 of them there...i think..including ivan and kee guan..lol..ivan wanted to have breakfast at sim..trying to catch the 2 chuns and ang swimming..ahah..so 5 of us...vin me gj aks and samuel tried to sneak out of sch...and we were thinking of the best route...ahaha...den we made our way to hcjc..told em i wanted to catch juniors taking part in hcjc inv..so yeah i made my way to the canteen and spotted them...didn't really see who else was there cuz i wasn't wearing specs..haha..guess they're quite well prepared...clement yiann and galven all speaking..guess it went pretty well...haha..the 5 of us made our way to my house after that..lol..there wasn't anybody standing guard at the hcjc gate... &nbsp; So well..kinda slacked till 11++ when vincent got back from sch after taking maths test...which ang had misplaced his and aik's test paper...and they had to re-do it..heard the "re-test" was really really tough...lol..ah den vincent informed me that ang said that he heard joseph tan saying that&nbsp;run was cancelled&nbsp;at 700...so of course he told me there was no run...then after that at around 720 he said there was run again..zzz....so well..ang said that there would be no problems so long as form teachers make no violent objections to our boycotting of the thing.hah! &nbsp; off to cine later..wahh...met lotsa ppl there...coach kelv's sister...evelyn...went to have lunch at long johns..after we finished mr aks decided to hone his ice-shooting skills by shooting at the sparkians at the neighbouring table...he kept shooting and they didn't retaliate..but after a while they did..at pzh..lol.and pzh got damn pissed he just threw an entire ice cube at them cuz it wasn't him that shot em and he was the one that got hit...lol..and they stopped retaliating.hah. &nbsp; met up with nic and got into the cinema..realised we were sitting in front of the sparkians and lots other chinese high guys in uniform.lol...didn't really try to recognise who they were..so just took my seat and just tried to enjoy the movie..critics really did not take a liking to the show...only giving it 2 stars and stuff..but woah..it absolutely surpassed expectations...probably cuz i wasn't expecting much...lol..it was a sensational movie...music composed by hans zimmer...a jerry bruckheimer movie...wah...it was really really magnificent...the battle scenes were fantastic..they could have provided alot more background info though...keira knightley came out too late!!!ahhh...the strategems used were impeccably timed...fantastic..just that i didn't quite like the end cuz 2 of my fav characters died..argh..shan't say who..you should check it out.. ;) i don't exactly like king arthur's face though...haha...he sorta had the face that resembled a person who was gonna kill a foe when the event was supposed to be grandeur and happy and stuff...lol... &nbsp; left our seats after that and realised u-glen jun zhe and jonsng were all watching just behind us..lol..they came from literature symposium..waha...wat a coincidence...lol...off to pool later on...regained my form!!!wahaha...triumphed over&nbsp;vincent 4-1..and the reason why he got one rack was cuz i accidentally hit the black ball in...lol...i wouldn't mind another game some other time&nbsp;aiks...i'll do much better this time...=]

       this entire week has been incredibly bad...think i have to put up with this for bout 15 weeks more or less until o's are over..wth man... &nbsp; Was putting up with excruciating headaches almost everyday...almost turned into a nocturnal creature..i was sleeping at odd times and waking up at times when even perfect 10 decided to desert me. Obviously i couldn't put up with it through the week..i let go...both physically and mentally...somehow i managed to reclaim the grasp and live another day... &nbsp; Today was quite crap really. I mean..what's new? Waking up at 5+ again to do the RP presentation..&nbsp; during which i realised couple hours later than aiks didn't make an effort to prepare for it..i was hoping for much betta competition..haha..not that he didn't do well..just that i know he can do excellently..even though he can translate his brilliant thoughts into words instantaneously...anw..no hard feelings yea?haha...didn't really mean it..=p As usual...laura ng popped in through the back door and saw that i was sort of&nbsp;in the process of&nbsp;interpolating my "anti-thesis"..and she left with "this class is very good." oh no. she remembers me..i think...or probably some other class did very poorly or sth like that..allow me to take some credit..there ain't much worth accrediting for other parts of the day. &nbsp; got back maths test..77 only..wth man..everyone was like damn easy damn easy..sure get 100 marks..and i think bout half the class got 90 and above? gawd...i was putting up with a headache and really couldn't really straighten out the mathematics. i calculated with my own brainless mind 6-8+20 = -22. sheesh..think i've got to go back to attend primary sch once again... &nbsp; went for singing practice for class song..just in case you didn't know...mdm pregnant wong went to submit our class song to participate in some competition..with some "luck" we managed to emerge through to the finals..and we're supposed to perform on the 21st august and incidentally i was chosen...lol..that's the day my bro's coming back from the states..hopefully that day will turn out much better than today. so well..i really needn't some water to lubricate my throat..couldn't really reach the notes in the chorus..so was asking for water..it didn't really go very well..'cos i was having problems adjusting to the rythm and pace...haiz. &nbsp; went to play soccer at street court...i wasn't really in the mood actually..i had once again injured my tailbone with some invaluable help from vincent soh...i wonder how it's gonna heal. Tried to be keeper...but oh my god...i was really losing concentration and i totally misjudged a back pass and took my eye off the ball for a split-second..and i actually flicked the ball into the goal through my legs...crap man..later really didn't wanna be keeper anymore my tailbone was proving really gonna hurt if i dived and injured it again...after that went to play again as outfield player...crap man..i was misplacing passes and making stupid moves and stuff...really wasn't focused..it was a crap game..we eventually lost to the evidently much better team who really were equipped with sublime skills... &nbsp; I think i'm making an effort to improve my mood..i dun really wanna implicate anyone...most things that i really enjoy doing didn't exactly turn out well..they place me in a predicament in which i think that every thing is useless..and living is virtually useless. Seriously..speaking..singing...goalkeeping...stuff which make me feel some sense of ability..one which i can derive pride..pleasure..and respect..dammit..stuff haven't exactly been smooth-sailing..not that they're supposed to all the time anw..i guess it's a process i'll have to live with...i'm getting used to this process...learning and growing stronger...but i never wanna rue my chances ever again...i'm gonna take my chances...well...at least i know i tried when i fail. Well..something that i really enjoy the most isn't available to be something that i can indulge in..and yet it is something that hurts me the most..a knife stuck in the heart probably only "king arthur" can extract..ok forget the last part.it's crap.

       I wanted you to know that i love the way you laugh i wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph And I know it serves me well i wanna hold you high and steal your pain   Because im broken when i am lonesome and i dont feel right when you go away  You've gone away u dont feel me ...anymore  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high you steal my pain away Theres so much left to learn and no one left to fight i wanna hold you high and steal your pain   Because im broken when i am open and i dont feel like i am strong enough  Because i am broken when i am lonesome and i dont feel right when you go away  Because im broken when i am open and i dont feel right now i am strong enough  Because i am broken when i am lonesome and i dont feel right when you go away  Because i am broken when i am lonesome and i dont feel right when you go away  You've gone away u dont feel me...anymore  Can't find a song that's more appropiate. i've seriously been disintegrated. For some unknown reason i'm in a really really bad mood. Perhaps it's because of "it"...but i've been trying to get over it...no doubt i've been unable to do so thus far. Injured my tailbone...Specs disformed by some idiot with a fetish of stripping males..wth man..like i did anything to offend him...at least the conscience that remains within my memory capacity is clear...whoever you are you better not let me know who you are..feel worse than crap now...still got 2 tests to handle tmr...hais.

       Ronaldo wants to join spurs! lol. looks like the appointment of frank arnie will be the turning point for Tottenham. lol. he is absolutely fantastic..bringing in Santini..getting rid of postiga..drafting in pedro mendes and sean davis..the average age in the spurs squad is definitely gonna drop precipitously..they'll definitely perform the next season..i can't seem to be able to spot any eventual impediment that will result in another disappointing season..  Ah well..English prelim oral yesterday went very very well..arrived in sch real early to play some soccer...wooah..i hit the post and smashed the post but still wasn't able to score..argh..and nic was able to get a hat-trick..cool man...the impending oral was making wei zhi real nervous..lol..but he was the last one..so i tried to calm him down..  man..the wait was extremely long..but eventful though..lol..we invented a new game "rubbish paper basketball" or something like that i think..lol..we just crushed one piece of paper and moulded into something which resembled a ball and tried to score by shooting it into the rubbish bin. Sounds pretty childish..but it was quite fun...some crappy combination of chapteh and soccer i guess..lol.  oh well..i was 2nd last..and i was getting quite nervous..and well i just sat down and thought of some stuff.."why was i getting nervous..i was afraid that i won't perform well right..but getting nervous won't help me get better remarks and impressing the examiner..so i should just get the nervous sensation out of me and make an attempt to display some extent of savoir-faire..lol.."  So..i began mumbling to myself..."Let the rational thinking mind take control and let go of any distressing sensations.." and woah..it really worked wonders..trudged into the room with overwhelming confidence(not over-confidence)hehe...was really worried that laura ng might have recalled that i was a debater so she would be extremely stringent..but luckily she did not..lol..and it went really well..not a single prompt...just one question..that's bout it..and it ended off really well...  she commented.."Good..very good...do you take literature?"   Well obviously i denied it..and she replied.."what a pity..."   lol..feeling rather "ego" now..pardon me..wahahaha...so ppl...anitime when ur nerves are getting the better of u..tell yourself..let the "rational thinking" mind take over..lol..it really helps..=)  haha..was feeling really good..so went out with xavier, jon, ks and xavier's senior...first went for lunch at scotts' picnic...guess who we met there...lol...lokelf sia..lol..apparently she went there right after eng oral as well..she was there alone with kalavathi..really didn't expect to see her there man..lol..den went to the usual place for pool..must say..lady luck was really on my side..and i was kinda on form i guess..lol..i won every game i played..lol. It totally rocked man..went to play LAN for the first time in 3 months..and lol..still did very well...surprisingly so...lol..and went back home to play football once again.lol.  For some reason..something struck me to learn beckham..perhaps aspiring to be better than him...lol..so i decided to imitate him and learn his "trademark freekick"..first time..didn't exactly work well...so i said to myself.."ahhh..didn't bend my back enough..." so well..i tried a second time bending my back much more..and OMG. i was absolutely gobsmacked after i took the shot...it went straight into the top right hand corner..en route it swerved diagonally down...it was a sublime shot..lol..it was really fantastic..wahaha..  Dun mind me..i'm in a very very good mood now...haha..albeit something wasn't exactly achieved yesterday...only 2 ppl would know pertaining to which matter..so yeah..nvm..i don't think it matters anymore..

       Yeah yeah...i did fall for the trap...lol...but it's all due to being out late at night 'cos i had tuition...-_-" All of you at home get to check out news and verify the credibility of the info and stuff..haha..managed to play the prank on other ppl as well..hehe...do take a look...it's really quite incredible...  "CNN News: Terrorist attack in Portugal. 203 deaths so far and hundreds more injured. Portugal soccer team caught in attack. Unconfirmed reports say coach Scolari killed in attack. For latest news, please visit www.cnn.com or sms to 72111 to subscribe to CNN breaking news."  yeah it's damn crap man..but i didn't receive the last sentence otherwise i would have known that it was bogus..haha...  oh well it's been a busy week...tests coming incessantly at us...struggling to hold on..but still managed to do it..hah..hopefully i'll pass all of em with flying colours..though it isn't quite probable..hah  Class committee meeting was quite crap actually...nothing constructive was produced..we still didn't manage to reach a decision..i don't think it's possible to reach a consensus when everyone's so insistent bout stuff and unwilling to alter their preferences...argh...  today's wongsm's b'day and tmr's anglc's..so well we gave them cards and sang b'day songs. god..kc's really mad...i shall not say what he did to ang here...he totally went bonkers..lol..  Caught spiderman today..woah..cinema was quite packed..lotsa teenagers watching..esp after the end of the jc exams or sth like that...the movie was pretty good...almost living up to expectations..but i think further improvisation can be made...pretty good plot and action and stuff...but kirsten dunst doesn't look as good as she did in the first instalment...=p didn't quite like the ending though..even though there were plenty of quotable quotes in the movie...skip this part if u haven't watched the movie and planning to do so..  May Parker: I believe there's a hero in all of us. Gives us strength, makes us noble. Even though sometimes, we have to give up the thing we want the most.   Spider-Man: [realizes he may have recovered his super-powers] I'm back! I'm back!  Spider-Man: [falls down on a car, moans] My back. My back...

        Four All Who Reed and Right   We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes; but the plural of ox became oxen not oxes.  One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, yet the plural of moose should never be meese.  You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice; yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.  If the plural of man is always called men, why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?  If I spoke of my foot and show you my feet, and I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?  If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?  Then one may be that, and three would be those, yet hat in the plural would never be hose, and the plural of catis cats, not cose.  We speak of a brother and also of brethren, but though we say mother, we never say methren.  Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him, but imagine the feminine, she, shis and shim.  Let's face it,English is a crazy language.  There is no egg in eggplant,nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple.  English muffins weren't invented in England.  We take English for granted.  But if we explore its paradoxes,we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are squareand a guinea pig is neither from Guinea, nor is it a pig.  And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing,g rocers don't groce and hammers don't ham?  Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends,but not one amend?  If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them,what do you call it?  If teachers taught,why didn't preachers praught?  If a vegetarian eats vegetables,what does a humanitarian eat?  Sometimes, I think all the folks who grew up speaking English should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane.  In what other language do people recite at a play and play at a recital?Ship by truck and send cargo by ship?  Have noses that run and feet that smell?  How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same,while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?  You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down;in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm goes off by going on.  i know it sounds crappy..haha..but worth a read and a laugh. enjoy.  -courtesy of mountainwings-

        An interesting anecdote...do take a look. =D  One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well.The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well.At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly.Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down. A few shovel loads later,the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what hesaw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, hewould shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off!  Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.The donkey later came back and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.  MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass,it always comes back to bite you.

       Well actually i'm making an unfounded statement 'cos common tests aren't over yet..haha...but they're gonna be over in approximately 4 hours time?haha..  been doin nothing much these days..really..this has been one of the most slack weeks i've ever experienced..most of the time i'm just sitting in front of the computer doing nothing much...watching tv and stuff...yawnz..caught a walk to remember on hbo the other day though...man..ziying now i know why u love that movie so much...that show is really really fantastic...i cried my heart out couple of times man..haha...mandy moore's just so gorgeous..haha...gee it's really a very touching story...lol...think i'm gonna watch it again..haha...  singapore idol has been utter crap. seriously. bunch of william-hung wannabes going up...some people intentionally came up with some sort of alter ego specially for the show? and wat's the freaking point...that guy's really dumb man..well the guy in question is mr banana man...i think he's just there to waste his bloody time man...either that or he's too dumb to consider the consequences and possibilities of doing so...what a total moron man...otherwise perhaps he just doesn't have the guts at all man...what a loser...there were a few exceptions though..some people sang quite well...i thought the eurasian who performed a rendition of alicia keys' if i ain't got you did pretty well...but the judges weren't really impressed by her...haha..luckily i ain't one of the judges...lol...  Common tests have been fine i suppose...they weren't really difficult to the extent that i had to scratch my head half the time to try to squeeze something out of my brain...whenever i have vital info inside that is...a maths yesterday was kind of murderous. totally had no idea how to do a question..'cos i didn't understand it at all..until last 5 minutes when i just rushed through it..and i think i managed to get it correct.hehe. but i stumbled upon other difficult questions or when i really had no idea how to continue..argh...oh well..no choice but to wait for the paper to come back..recess..wah...stoopid aiks...came coming after me with my ball 'cos he was trying "dodgeball" wth man...mr softball obviously throws with consummate precision and vicious strength...so yeah...i managed to sustain couple of hits.hah...eventually i took refuge in the staff room..haha..saw kee guan and andy outside there actually..and they wanted to go see soh to ask about the chemistry grade...whew...i got an a2..haha..soh said i even beat lim young...erps...heheh hope that's a compliment though..haha...aiya...actually it's nothing la..i think lim young just didn't do as well as he hoped for...'cos probably he stumbled a bit was quite careless la..in other words he was most likely just "off form" yeah...so yeah...hope i keep it up..heh.  later had geog..wah...another tough paper...melvin chng...god...trying to slaughter us to bits...it was so bloody tough..man...hope i do okie man...had to go see wongsm later...i thought it was nothing much..'cos she said see her after school for a short while(it's a direct translation) so i did...i was still planning to catch i, robot with nic after the "short" meeting with her...wah piang....it turned out she wanted us to go to sajc for the chinese song writing competition thing for a meeting..oh man..so gj cheng liang and i made our way there first..got there quite early..think 30 mins before the scheduled time...wah...was under scrutiny from the sajc people man...people casthing curious gazes...probably insulted ones too..they didn't feel too comfortable with our presence i think...i mean it's their school right...yawnz...so well...went in sit there for a while and waited for the rest to arrive...wah...eventually we found out that...all of us wouldn't be able to sing...'cos when wongsm submitted the cd which contained the recording of the song...the people judged it according to that cd...so that now we had the chance to actually perform it this time...omg...so turns out willy was the only one that could sing...and guo jun was the lyrics-writer..at least for parts of the song...so yeah..the both of them stayed there to take pics and stuff...bloody hell..wongsm made us go all the way to sajc...and we wasted our time there...wat the hell man...i could have gone to watch i, robot!!!argh. crap man...when i gave her a call she didn't even apologise to us or anything..dammit man...she'd better allocate higher marks to the 8 of us for today's test..at least for the six of us who went sajc and did nothing...argh.

the pear...later on i found out my gums were bleeding..haha...oh well..was fine later...i guess i've grown quite numb to injuries in the mouth hitherto 'cos of the long period of time that i had to live with braces and the numerous operations i had to endure..lol...anw..gotta thank nic and his mum...got me jay chou's new album...it's really cool...hehe...really love some of the songs in

       翻著我們的照片 想念若隱若現去年的冬天 我們笑得很甜 看著妳哭泣的臉, 對著我說再見 來不及聽見　妳已走得很遠 也許妳已經放棄我　也許已經很難回頭 我知道是自己錯過　請再給我一個理由說妳不愛我  就算是我不懂　能不能原諒我 請不要把分手當作妳的請求 我知道堅持要走 是妳受傷的藉口 請妳回頭　我會陪妳一直走到最後  就算沒有結果　我也能夠承受 我知道妳的痛　是我給的承諾 妳說給過我縱容　沉默是因為包容 如果要走　請妳記得我　如果難過　請妳忘了我
