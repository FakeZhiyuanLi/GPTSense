      Mood: Slightly tipsy and miserable Listening:Busted-Without You(Great song, but makes you cry)  I didn't do all that much today. My life is the social equivalent of tofu really, but I kind of don't mind it like that. I need my own space, away from friends who would kill me (seriously) if they knew I liked McFly and Busted. But that's not important right now. Although I do love them, especially the cute drummer from McFly. And the guitarist Danny. Mmmm.....Sorry. I'll stop fantasising about unreachable faraway people now.   Instead, I'll ramble on about unreachable people who are tantalisingly near. Person, really, if I'm going to be specific about this (which I am). Gorgeous, kind, lovely male person with dark hair, blue eyes and a melt-worthy smile. He's almost as cute as Harry Judd. Almost, but no-one's perfect. We get on well, or so I thought. Until he started being unhappy and I,stupidly, got worried and asked him what was wrong. Clearly that was a nasty and bad thing to do, or so he implied. Oh well. Love is a nasty thing anyway. All it does in the end is hurt you. I prefer chocolate. It loves you back, produces the same feelings as falling in love (the same chemicals anyway0 and requires a lot less advanced psychology.(That's what love mostly is, e.g. what will he think if I do this?Or this?etc.) Chocolate doesn't shout at you, it doesn't shut you out, it doesn't ask you out and dump you four times in a row in less than six months.(this did actually happen, it's not just a silly example).  Yes, I KNOW I'm a doormat. I was pretty messed up at the time, food-wise etc.   I wonder if anyone's reading this. If you are, then I'm sorry to bore you. I know none of my friends are, because if they were I'd get a load of stick, so I haven't told them about this. I hope they don't find out; if they do, I don't know what I'll do. Not something constructive, that's for sure. Probably lock myself in a dark room, eat chocolate and dream of The Guy, rather pathetically. Well, I like being sad old me, and that's the way I'm going to stay. My dream job IS a historian, I DO like McFly and Busted (though I can't afford either of their albums) and I DO repel guys. OK, so I wouldn't mind not repelling guys. But the rest of it I am fine with.   Sorry to be boring again. I guess that's just the way I am.Bye for now. McFly rock!  xxx

      This is a new blog, because too many people I know were reading the old one, and let's just say the results weren't too nice. I warn you now, I'm nasty, opinionated, sarcastic and critical, and most of what I say makes little or no sense. But that's just me. Sorry.   Mood;Annoyed Listening: When the Levee Breaks - Led Zeppelin  I am ANNOYED. Why, perhaps you ask? Well, OK, you probably don't ask, but it makes for a better introduction than 'I am annoyed because'. Anyway, the reason for my annoyed mood is that I am expected to like the bands my friends like, hate the bands my friends hate and bitch about these bands. I like McFly and Busted. Is that a crime? I'm not alone, I know that much. Just because I don't like pop music in general doesn't mean I can't like these bands; they aren't like normal pop. These guys write and play their own songs, and are pretty damn cute into the bargain. So they aren't Led Zeppelin, but they're still nice,talented people who don't deserve to be vilified by people whose closest brush with fame so far has been a small part in an Offenbach musical. Clearly that qualifies one to pass judgement over a famous band.   Yesterday I joined McFly's street team, but I can't take part in many of the missions that most members do, because I'll be ridiculed for the rest of my life. I'm not exactly popular already. I know you shouldn't care what others think, but when you're a teenager and you have to mix with these people every day it's not as easy as all that. Why can't we all just be able to be individuals? Life is about choices, and we shouldn't have to make the choices our friends want us to make; we should be able to make the choices WE want to make. It's a small thing, but it really irritates me. Like mosquitoes.   Today I've been revising, because my GCSEs start in earnest in a couple of weeks' time, and I'm panicking. There's so much stuff to learn, and once I learn one concept, everything else just seems to leave my head. It's as though my brain can only hold one idea at a time. It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have so many in such a short space of time, and so many in general. I have 23 exams in total - that's a lot of revision. And I'm not getting very far. Never mind; what will be will be, whether I like it or not. Oh well. I'm going to try and contact the most gorgeous guy in the world now. Goodbye.  p.s.:New McFly single Obviously: out June 21st! It's really cool! Buy it! Trust me, I love Led Zep so I have high standards!
