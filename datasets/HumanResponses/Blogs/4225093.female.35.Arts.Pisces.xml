      I have been blogging on another site.  But dummy me...well, I gave that address to everyone I know.  Best friend EmCee warned me at the time that it was dangerous to do so.  I naysayed her crazy paranoid ways with an "I don't care if everyone knows about me" kind of Breakfast at Tiffany's wave of the hand and jovial laugh.  Fast forward to now.  Feeling trapped and censored.  Not sure of who I can trust.  Needing an outlet and feeling like I have no where to turn with my thoughts.  I am starting here.  This is my beginning.  This a good place to start.  Good week to start and a great day to start (Fri the 13th.)  Oh yes.  I will taunt the superstitions because I am that reckless this week.  Today, no...scratch that...this week has tried me hard.  Too hard for my liking.  I am a bit of an uptight free spirit.  I would like to let things roll off my back.  I would like to be that gal that doesn't get hurt easily.  I am a girly girl.  In the best and worst ways.  I am trying through my creativity to explore all the questions that lead me to contantly examining myself.   Am I a good person or do I just play one on tv?  Do I worry more about giving or getting.  Therein lies the rub.  I would have previously said (and many others would too) that I give more.  But I am finding that I am a martyr and really am more worried about getting (of course after I have been giving and giving and giving, etc).  I don't think I act authentically.  I don't take care of my needs very well which then erupt in that martyr behavior just mentioned.  I worry about what others think of me.  I worry about my boundaries.  I worry that I will never live the life I think I am destined to.  I worry way too much.  I have lived a life of worrying and not even knowing that I was doing it.  My mother is a worrier.  My father the opposite.  I thought I had a balance.  I thought the fruit fell in the middle of the trees.  But alas, on days like today, I am very aware that I am exactly like my mother in all the wrong ways.  I am PMSing.  I know.  Cliche.  But the truth is that prior to 3 years ago, I never really got that.  I got cramps but not PMS.  I thought it was an idea invented so that women could be bitchy.  But subtly, I started to notice that I would go a bit nutty the week before my monthly friend.   And the weirdest thing about the PMS is that I never attribute it to PMS until I have done the damage and then I am like, "Oh....maybe  that  is why I feel like the ENTIRE world is against me when something as innocuous as not getting in the fastest line at the supermarket can turn my world around to Chekovian dramatic proportions.  Oy.  I used to say that I am so dramatic in my ennui.  I feel that is true many times.  But not this week.  I am dramatic in my own drama of the mind.  A theater production brought to you by Hormones.  I work in Hollywood.  For a company that makes movies.  I love the people in my department for the most part.  Great group of people.  We, who are left after a bold sweep earlier this year got more work placed upon us.  Things are okay.  I hate the particular job.  I am a creative type who after being unemployed for over a year felt very grateful for this job in a non-creative position.  It was only supposed to get me on my feet after 6 months.  I have been here 2 years.  It is taking its toll. I work for 2 meglomaniacs who are at the lowest rung but feel compelled to wield their power over me.  Yummy.  I have had outbursts, thoughts of suicide, passive-aggressive matches with them, until finally this week, I took it above their heads.  I was scared at first.  Like a child who has been tortured by her babysitters and then finally says to her mom, "They are mean".   I wouldn't have done it except I was ready to walk.  I ended up talking to the big boss after the boyboss and I had a very public display yelling at eachother.  I had to go to HR and tell my side of things.  Events could end up being as good as they feel now, or I could be completely in the dark about what I think is going on right now.   It didn't occur to me until yesterday that I am PMSing.  Oh well...can't be helped.  I did it.  I stood up for myself.  Maybe it took me being emotionally wrought to the point of shouting "I am not your child!" in a legal department.  Maybe the reason things feel soo icky and emotional right now (besides the obvious) is that I am supposed to stand up for myself.  I am supposed to be the individual that I am rumoured to be.   It is exhausting standing up for yourself if you are not used to it.  But now...it all feels a little less heavy.  The stars are aligned and girlboss and boyboss are respecting me.  It is all good.   I listen to KCRW's Sounds Eclectic and it sets a nice tone for my day.   Tonight I am going to a spoken word event that I am very excited about.   More tomorrow on the state of my life.
