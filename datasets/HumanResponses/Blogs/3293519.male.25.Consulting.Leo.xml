       My god, I'm so disappointed. Yesterday I was posting my first message to my blog announcing the MR2 Spyder Journal, and just yesterday my Check Engine Light (CEL) turned on. I ran to google and searched for some knowledge. Can you believe that a loose gas cap can cause that little light to turn on!? Sadly it wasn't my case. Some other, say cheaters, only reset the Engine Computer Unit (ECU) to turn off that mind boggling (not blogging) light. For those who rely on this technique, you must know that the CEL is there for a purpose, not only to mess with you. If you turn it off, your car will keep running with a simple problem that can become a major threat. If you are able to live with that fact, there are 2 ways to reset the ECU.   The simpler one:  just disconnect the car battery and wait 10 seconds until all the car memory is cleared. The trade of this technique is that all memory is reset, even your car radio stations presets and car clock if any.  The not simple but not hard one:  Every car has a couple of fuse boxes. One inside your car, and one (or more) under the hood, near the engine. Open the box and look for a big fuse with maybe the words ECU on the top and unplug it; wait for 10 sec for the memory can be entirely erased then re-plug the fuse.  Either way, the light will turn off. If you are facing a real problem with your car, as soon as you turn it on the light will be lit again. And there's where the real problem begins. What's even worst is that you can get charged up to $80 dollars just to connect your car to the computer that check the error code stored at the ECU. That's a real shame but if you love your car nothing is too expensive.  Well people that's all for now. Hope to get back soon.
