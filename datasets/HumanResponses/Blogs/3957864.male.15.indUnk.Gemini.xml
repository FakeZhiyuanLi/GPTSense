      So anyways today, my parents have made it official, i will be in ottawa then quebec with them alone, without my guitar, or a laptop, or any form of talking to anyone for 5 or 6 whole days. I won't be able to talk to ANYONE or play my guitar.... TORTURE!!  I'm gonna miss everyone while I'm there so much, and I won't enjoy the touring, i'm gonna end up bored and pissed off at my parents =\.     So I was at the dentist's today for my 6 month check up. It went fine, no cavaties or anything. Bah.... it did rain alot while I was down there.    It's felt like some people have been avoiding me as of late while some of the other people I know smother me, so what the hell is that? Compensation... jeez...........  Anyways, despite all my stress tea still calms me down, kinda relaxs me. and again... THANK YOU HAILEN FOR GIVING ME THE IDEA TO DRINK TEA. =\ i owe you big time for it.     Smoke on the water!  Fire in the sky!    Smoke on the Water - Deep Purple  Yes... this is possibly the most over played song by guitarists except for Stairway itself. It's still an amazing song, and Stairway is still the best. But Smoke on the Water is so simple, so possibly more people know it then Stairway, I dunno. Playing either 1 in a music store is still likely to get you kicked out.     -Mike

      Well after taking Tim's blasted test to determine what colour best represents me, and reading what they all are. I'm apparantly red/blue.    Not much else to say about today. Hung out with Frank.... I was gonna go downtown with Kelli, but =\. So she got really pissed at me.... christ, i've got my own life. I got home and I saw an msn window open with her and she was saying something like "i thought you were a nice guy, who'd listen and care" or whatever. Now, let me clarify something will everyone..... -with the possible exception of Damon- NONE of you have ANY RIGHT WHATSOEVER to give me crap. My parents do it CONSTANTLY, so suck it up, and get on with your life.     Jeez...........     No song quotes today, I think I'll just sit here and take in my thoughts.  Man....... I love her...... so much, looks like Rosebud just got stronger.  All I know is however I felt the first time... well for this time  It's so much stronger    -Mike

      Shit it seems I have nothing useful to do with my time lately. Evidence #1, I was at kelli's house, no not teaching though... PAINTING! something I am well known to be horrible at. And we didn't even paint half the time. Evidence #2 Fencing.... I DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH MY BLADE. Evidence #3 Teaching Tim how to play Piano.... sounds fine right? no, not if we spent the whole time watching Gundam Wing - Endless Waltz (I'm starting to hate it.....) Wow, top it all off? Sure... my parents are still forcing me to "attend" Kumon... I dunno I show up there once out of 5 times, the other times I just take a nice walk to the park and read or write lyrics.    Well anyways, I just got back from fencing and I think every muscle, fibre and bone in my body is about to give way... 14 laps in 14 minutes?? Jeez... I managed 12. 1 hour of nothing but pure foot work. Insanity.....  And yet despite all this? Do you think my mind would have cleared yet? No.... 3 things still linger inside the depths of my mind.    #1 and #2.... VERY few people know about this. And you're not gonna learn by reading here...    #3 My parents... we actually GETTING ALONG and then what? What happnes you ask? I get smacked over the head with a textbook... Nice people they are eh? Oh well =\. Hopefully things will cool down again.     Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a hollywood basement.    Red Hot Chilli Peppers - Californication.... WRONG SPACE IS NOT THE FINAL FRONTIER    -Mike

      Well today was enjoyable... err kinda anyways. So I woke up, went down, went to AK, played around. Then I came home and once again I find myself teaching, Kelli... again. =\ So wierd, why must my students go on vacation? But anyways we hung out in the park =\ played then came to my house. Her power chords are coming along, she's getting better. And also once again she poked around at my feelings, and poked me =\.Kelli... you are hyper. So right now I'll tell this to the 8 or so people who know... SAY A WORD AND I WILL SKIN YOU ALIVE. =\ Wow pethetic aren't I?    Anyways, moving on. Today is a special day to all guitarists. Today is Saul Hudson's birthday. For those who aren't aware Saul Hudson is Slash of Guns'n'Roses/Velvet Revolver. This man is amazing, he may not be the best but he doesn't have to be, he's a still a god.    I'm not sure if I have much else to say today. Right now I feel like my emotions have spilt all over the place. ARGH how I hate being a teenager, but the feelings I have sometimes I'd never trade... they make me feel...... warm i guess.... some people will just do that to you.     I don't go to school every monday  I've got my reason to sleep  Don't you tell me how I should be  Made up my mind about the music  Made up my mind about the style  I know that I'm stable and able to settle down.    F-f-f-falling - The Rasmus  Yeah, 1 of the few new wave bands I like. DEAL WITH IT THEY ROCK    -Mike

      So he's back and he was at my house for a bit. Talked, played, some basketball, a little music.    Well it's official, I'm now in search of a job, a real 1. So if anyone has kind of job where I can work shifts to match school basically tell me.  So i was at that whole jazz thing downtown for a while, it's cool you guys should all go check it out. I'm feeling kinda out of it today I guess so I don't wanna talk much I suppose. I've got that whole.... empty... kinda lonely feeling, could this mean I actually do have feelings? I guess I'll see how it all works out =\.   *sigh* I gotta scrap up some cash, and get myself together while i'm at it.  So here's Damon's 1st official set of lyrics to be completed and now to take feedback.  Fragile    Lost in the dark of this day  I am blinded by the pain  In my head, I lie awake  Let these dreams desert me yet  Now that you're gone  I’m falling apart inside myself  Now that I'm lost  And scattered all around    I'm gone, I don't know where to go  Taking a part of me  I don't know where I am without you  Now, I don't know how to be  Dying inside again  I'm nothing but shattered dreams    Thoughts running wild in my head  Never fading never read  In my veins, it’s time again  To release the nightmares now...  Now that you're gone  I’m falling apart inside myself  Now that I'm lost  And scattered all around    I'm gone, I don't know where to go  Taking a part of me  I don't know where I am without you  Now, I don't know how to be  Dying inside again  I'm nothing but shattered dreams    Now that you're gone  I’m falling apart inside myself  Now that I'm lost  And scattered all around    Crying in my mind, in my veins  The tears tear at my soul   In the dark, of this day  I'll sleep forever...    I'm gone, I don't know where to go  Taking a part of me  I don't know where I am without you  Now, I don't know how to be  Dying inside again  I'm nothing but shattered dreams  I don't know where to go  Taking a part of me  I'm nothing but shattered dreams  I don't know how to be  Dying inside again  I don't know where I am without you  I'm nothing but shattered dreams    Geeeee I wonder how my guitar's gonna come out on that eh?  Christ I can't think about anything but her, and how miserable I feel..... Stupid me =\.  Maybe it's cause my dad's making me sign something saying if i don't get a 75% average or higher i'll have to WILLINGLY go to miltary school. Well.... at least i avoided it for this year.  DAMNIT even as I type I can't stop thinking about her, or how screwed I am =\.     I've come to my senses, that I've become senseless  and I could give you lessons, how to ruin your friendships  And every last conviction, I smoked them all away  And I drank my frustrations down the drain out of the way    So I sit and wait and wonder   Does anyone else feel like me?  Someone so tired of their routines and dissappearing self esteem    I'll sing along  And with every emergency  Just sing along  I'm the king of catastrophes  I'm so for gone  That deep down inside I think it's fine by me  I'm my own worst enemy    I could be an expert, on codependancy  I could write the best book, on under age tradegy  I've been spending my time, at the local liquor store  I've been sleeping nightly, on my best friend's kitchen floor    So I sit and wait and wonder  Does anyone else feel like me?  I'm so over dosed on apathy and burnt out on sympathy    The Science of Selling Yourself Short - Less Than Jake  These guys ROCK, they have a new CD out and in a few days a new DVD, you'd think I'd be happier wouldn't you.... jeez I'm pethetic.    -Mike

      Ok so today, let me think. Well..... At 11 am 4 people call me and ALL of them end up my house by 12:30. So Kelli gets here first, and decides to jump in the pool, and after much nagging I decide to go in. So then it's us 2, we're bored senseless and Noah shows up, and he too doesn't wanna swim but Kelli ends up pushing him in. Still bored, so then Raphael AND Chris show up, and jump in. We're still bored and Raphael officially thinks Kelli is a bitch. WONDERFUL! Jeez I got so bored fast. I can teach Kelli guitar but there isn't much to my life besides music and that general area =\, so I'm not a very interesting person to hang around as everyone seemed bored. Jeez.......... So then me and Noah went up to Mike's, I got home... parents yell at me, I feel emptiness inside as usual by the end of the day. God.... I actually want school to come back, at least during the year I didn't feel empty and bored. I felt like I had purpose.    So on the way back from Mike's I saw someone in the middle of the street, totally trashed, in agony, on a strecher.... Jeez... I could never wish that on ANYONE not even my parents. No, it's against everything I stand for.... on the other hand someitmes I feel like's it happened to me because of my emotions........ You know.    So anyways, I've decided to see what I can about scrapping together some money.... So let's look at my spending shall we?    Marshall Cabinet + Head (My Amp) = 3200$  My Pedal Board (Wah, Tremelo, Distortion, Delay, Chorus, Equalizer, Super Phaser + a Tuner Pedal outside the box, and 3 other pedals.) = 1400$  Wireless Patch Cord = 250$  Strings, Picks, Capos, CDS, Food, All other Essentials = 15 000 $ probably over my life - this number's gonna get bigger over time still  Fender Strat = 900$  Fender Tele = 950$  Gibson LP = 2300$  Gibson Double Neck = 3000$  Seagul Acoustic (2) = 1800$  Ok so now let's add the set up for a home recording studio too =\ 3500$ Approx.    So in the end thats about 32 000$ in the end. Holy shit eh? Or more =\ We'll see.    Well I was gonna go teach tommorow but my dad has forbidden me to leave the house... because I got back late, oh well I was doing something I enjoyed.... errr well I usually am, stupid ass =\ We'll see how long that crap lasts. I hope it comes off before August =\, if it does I'll make it. So if I don't make to someone's house and I was teaching you, sorry. Here comes that whole empty feeling again     If you're free you'll never see the walls  If your head is clear you'll never free fall  If you're right you'll never fear the wrong  If your head is high you'll never fear at all    Exploder - Audioslave  Well Audioslave aren't quite as good as Rage Against the Machine but never the less. Maybe it's just there vocal problem.... ugh. Well for a while I thought it said "If you're right, you'll never feel wrong" either 1 makes sense. I never feel wrong, cause I wouldn't ever do something I'm ashamed to tell people. So anyways, people... try not to lie, I never do.... except to my parents.   Hard to believe.... unfortunately sometimes my memory won't co operate with me, and I can't remeber some shit so people don't believe me. *Sigh*     -Mike

      So today was dull, taught as usual, ran into Rob on the way home, he gave a ride to my house. Other then that? Jeez... swimming the afternoon talking to raph about going into next year's talent show.... uhhh Fade to Black by Metallica is ALL he wants to play. Now unfortunately =\ 2 problems. Problem A? Well I can't enter the damn thing twice! I wanna enter under my own band =\ the drummer or vocalist might be a temp as we don't all go to 1 school but still.My other problems I get the 2 beginning solos which are disgustingly easy and rythm. Ok so he wants the ending =\ errr i don't think so? He's too technically slow for it =\. He wants to show off basically =\ Now if we were doing something like Comfortably Numb where there are 2 amazing solos, I might stomach taking the 1st and apposed to the last. The other problem with both those songs actually is they never finish - they fade off. So he'd have to improv an ending, and he can't improv. So errrr I think I'm probably gonna enter under my own band and play Rock'n'Roll or something. Or maybe Black Dog =\. Raph's just being selfish.  Probably going shopping tommorow, ironically raph wants my dad's old acoustic for like 20$ which i'd have prob with. Jeez.....    Well anyways, i've started writing out my own music on staff. I'm done all 5 songs, time to start my new project. My whole frustration of late. I haven't written anything in months and for months all i've been is frustrated or down or something =\ Uh oh, I see a heavy song on it's way.    I feel like my emotions and my soul are just pouring into my music, I've felt it for a while now though. Sanctuary... Rosebud.... City Nights.... everything actually, i can just connect, when i hear it played back to me, I kinda wonder "shit i did that?", the riffs just seem to symbolize me and well as the solos. Maybe I'm good at improv, maybe I'm not.... some people say playing infront of people i'm amazing, so whatever i'll just take the praise. People also say I am Jimmy Page when I play. My look, the way i hold the guitar, my solos, my riffs, the way i move and everything, i just gotta finish the hair =\. Still, the music is my own style.     Life it seems will fade away  Drifting farther every day  Getting lost within myself  Nothing matters, no one else  I have lost the will to live  Simply nothing more to give  There is nothing for me  I need the end to set me free    Things just not what they used to be  I'm missing 1 inside of me  Deathly lost this can't be real  I cannot stand this hell I feel  Emptiness is filling me  To the point of agony  Growing darkness taking dawn  I was me but now he's gone!    Fade to Black - Metallica  Yesterday does seem as though it never existed eh? These guys take it for lyrics today. Moving and RIP to James father, thats what the song is about. Take it away Hammett    -Mike

      So what the hell eh?    Shit yesterday was fairly retarded. About 9 pm I'm sitting happy, typing on MSN my parents come in and start bitching at me, questioning my hair, my clothes, what i do, who i am, and telling me to change it. Holy crap people, if I can't be myself why should I even bother to wake up in the morning?    And almost as a sign immedialty afterwards. People are questioning me for teaching music. So I'm teaching about 11 people who are just beginning 9 guitar, 2 piano, and I have no problem it, I'll teach anyone. But it seems some people don't agree with my choice and choose to hammer it me calling it low and calling the people I teach horrible. Ok first of all lemme clear this off to anyone who's questioned me at music. I AM FAR ABOVE YOUR LEVEL so you are no position to do this. I have no problem if MORE people wanna learn, I'll start teaching them too. So to anyone who disagrees with me you can kiss my ass. I used to teach like what? 2 people during the year but now that summers here I have time to teach. Usually I try going to 2 people's house per day, but sometimes I'll just spend a whole day at 1 person's house teaching - if it happens to you, feel lucky =\ -    Ok now that I've cleared that up. I'm gonna start posting Damon's lyrics soon. Until them lemme close by saying to some people to stop prying at my heart and for those who know anything, realize I'll kill you =\. (it's an expression people....)     Mama take this badge from me  I can't use it anymore  It's getting dark, to dark to see  Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door    Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door  Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door    Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door  Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door    Mama put my guns in the ground  I can't shoot them anymore  That cold black cloud is coming down  Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door      Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door  Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door    Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door  Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door    Knockin' on heaven's door - Bob Dylan  This song has been covered by Clapton, Guns'n'Roses and to my disgust.... Avril Lavigne.  Jeez =\ It's getting passed around like a whore. Still G'n'R did the best version. Not because of Axl Rose have an orgasm as he sings it, because of Slash!    -Mike

      While it pours, rains cats and dogs and lots of other stupid cliches outside i'm stuck inside.   This morning was retarded enough, nice yelling arguement with my mom, about her shutting up and letting me get my own clothes, it my own money after all damnit, and I'm wearing the clothes.    So aside from that I've been so bored recently I've started playing video games again *shudder* So I've found myself playing Diablo 2 LOD again. Level 73 Ladder Sorceress on USeast named JimmyPage_ZoSo. I've got some decent gear or whatever. I'm a mono frozen orb build =\ Meant to MF like mad.    I think my body's feeling better. What with all the sleep i've finally gotten.  I'm generally happier now i guess. What with the prospect of everyone coming back to toronto, teaching guitar, more energy, my sexy new seagull acoustic (Which I have yet to name.) and probably blasting down streets/highways in a car with Paul, (but usually it's Frank =\.) going around town at 150 + MPH blasting hard rock contributes.  So it's basically raining out and I'm happy? Jeez =\. Only on a rainy day hahaha.  So now I'm just gonna post the last of the 5 songs. It's called City Nights and I suppose it really suits my mood today, considering the only reason I've been pissed off is the yelling with my parents but that comes standard. I wrote this song back a while go right atfer playing a gig.  City Nights:    Verse:  Come on now, let’s go hit the streets tonight  Take all your best friends  From out of town  And show them a good time  And it’d be cool, just to sit back  And remember why you’re all friends    Verse:  Come on now, let’s go hit the streets tonight  And I’ll play a gig to all your best friends  And to everyone else  And all the people that watch us play  Every night, we’ll never forget  How cool you guys are    Verse:  Come on now, let’s go hit the streets tonight  Out on the town is where we’ll be  To see every bar and club  Where are all our old friends hang out  Every street and night  We’ll be playing songs all night!    Outro:  Living for the music we write  These city lights  On a music night  I’ll find no more fights  It all feels so right  I’m living for these nights    Chorus:  The best times of life  Are spent at a gig  In front of the crowds  We’ve played to for years  Because when we play  We’ve seen them all get up  And just sing along!    =\ So that's all for now, maybe I'll post later, maybe not. Anyone with a suggestion for naming my new acoustic please tell me.     Cause I'm TNT  I'm dynamite  TNT  And I'll win the fight  TNT  I'm a powerload  TNT  Watch me Explode!    TNT - AC/DC  They just keep on rocking, definately worthy of my favourite song today, what with blasting in the car and, if you ever see a car with the stereo at max volume, blasting hard rock, look for me in it  =D     -Mike

      So anyways today was interesting enough. Took an hour long walk up to Kelli's taught her some guitar, spent alot of the time teaching her the Black Dog riff and just playing board games really =\. Whatever the exercise is good - and i'll teach anyone.    So i'm planning to go clothes shopping on thursday, just get myself my usual - some new white cargos, new t-shirts, new pair of sneakers -. And my parents find out I wanna go so they say... "You can go look, but we have to approve every piece of clothing before you buy" Yeah fuck them, I'm 15 =\ damnit i can shop for myself.... sutpid assholes.    Sooooo........ Anyways I don't have any particular song I can relate to my day so here's another 1 of our 5.  Someday:    Verse:  It’s something people ignore  You never take it seriously  Then it’ll come around  And you’ll need to choose  You stall; you stay, and stop  Soon you’ll regret  Your prison life all day…  Maybe sometime thought, someday  You’ll get on your way    Verse:  Here comes your cloud again  The dreary dull rain  Bringing with it only more boredom and pain  You’re on the same routine  Repetition all day long and night  It’s some something you regret  Part of your dead end prison life…  Maybe sometime though, someday  You’ll get on your way    Chorus:  Maybe someday,  Someday you’ll find your way  And maybe someday,  Someday you’ll get away  Cause maybe someday,  Someday you’ll find your way    A little shorter yes, but it's still fairly nice. Well my dad seems to be under the impression that he can legally send me to summer school WITHOUT my approval. Yeah fuck him, I'll stop him, get kicked out of my house and move in frank before i go through that shit.  Speaking of which he won't be back for ANOTHER FULL WEEK. Christ.... then my parents are talking about a vacation to quebec and dragging me along. So basically when Richard, Hailen, Frank, Matt, Fred all get back my slow, retarded parents wanna leave for a week. Idiots....    On a happier note I found it who it was that gave me the tea idea. Thank you SOOOO much Hailen and sorry for forgetting. I owe you =\. It calmed me down and got me through my parents little portion of hell, and it worked yesterday too. =D     I am the walrus  Koo Koo Ka Choo    I am the Walrus - The Beatles  These guys definately win my lyrics of the day award    -Mike

      Well anyways, like I said I'd post. I never lie =\ except to my parents -they have it coming-.  So anways today i found myself teaching yet another person to play the guitar. She picked up on the stuff fairly fast =\ Just some nirvana stuff and beginner stuff. Whatever =\.  But during that lesson my i kept thinking "wow, she's wierd." but then in comparison to myself, she's quite normal =\. Ever notice that? How you think so many people are wierd, but you're still the wierdest person you know.  Curious eh, also how some people prod at my life. So I guess i'll talk about most stuff.    For starters to everyone who's asked me my band sets up like this:  Damon - Vocals (In for good)  Thomas - Drums (In for good)  Derek - Bass (Questionable =\)  Elvy - Rythm Guitar (I'd honeslty prefer Keyboard =\)  Myself - Lead Guitar    Now with Damon I'm not the only 1 writing lyrics but i'll still probably write most of the music. So i still won't  give elvy any form of solos. I just hope he won't ask me for any =\ the songs represents my emotions, my soul and feelings all forced out through my guitar. It's my outlet peeple.    Next up people, WHO TOLD ME TO DRINK THAT TEA SATURDAY NIGHT? Tell me who you are = I'd like to thank you endlessly jeez. It calmed me right down =\ Help me survive i guess.    So anyways, during my "teaching session" with Kelli today she kept prodding at me about who i hang around with at MAC and we eventually got around to who a like. *Sighs*  So here's my history eh? Grade 8 - went out with someone, outside of my school. She's now moved away.  Grade 9? ah shit i'd rather not even go into last year, very painful. 1 crush that didn't mean ANYTHING, 1 that I loved with my heart and ended up not doing anything cept pouring my emotions into Rosebud.... my 1 and ONLY song about girls, and then 1 that confuses me..... just wonderful eh?  So I'm kinda out of it there. Anyways here's Rosebud:  Rosebud:   Verse:  I had a crush to start with  Some other girl  By a chance  I made a new friend  With her, I wish to ascend    Verse:  Known for 2 years  But never once known  I wish I started  Those 2 years back  But now I can only make new tracks    Verse:  I met her blindly  I’ve always been so shy  2 months later I opened my eyes  I can’t let go, as much as I try  I can’t let go  But what I feel, I don’t know how to show    Solo Prelude:  No illusions this time  My head is clear  I’m not shy now  Even if she’s near    Outro:  I wish she’d open up more  She hides herself, just like a rose  I want the morning to come  So I can see her bud  She’s just like an angel of light    Chorus:  One person, the only 1 I desire  My head’s always in the clouds  But she’s always higher    So thats my pain, usually my lyrics will represent my emotions, but sometimes they won't ever relate to my life. The 1's that don't relate will never make it up here =\. 3 more to go people before I run out of actual finished songs =\. Wrote that in febuary.     When your concious hits you knock it back with pills  Living Loving Maid (She's just a woman) - Led Zeppelin  I SAID IT YESTERDAY, GO LISTEN TO THEM    - Mike

      Yeah guessing my title you can get my mood already eh?  Well these last few weeks have been fun but now my body is starting to tell me to shut up and sleep. Which is gonna be hard as long as I co - exist with my parents.  So last night once again, they another "social gathering" in which i had to stay in my room not touching 1 guitar AND stay awake til everyone left in case they wanted to meet me. I'm suprised my parents acknowledge my existence to someone else, shit they barely acknowledge it to me.  So I was up til about about 1 - 2 fucking a.m. Jesus Christ my system rejects coffee, it does NOTHING to me after 10 minutes of energy, cept drop my energy. totally damn useless, I had like 4 cups last night.     =\ jeez someone told me to drink tea last night at like 11:30ish and I did. It calmed me right down, and helped me from not snapping all night, if you read this whoever you are - THANK YOU, and someone tell me who it was.  Christ I gotta get some sleep. From collapsing in my friend's car to having no energy, I think I' getting the message from my body - SLEEP. Here's comes that whole insomnia feeling again damnit. =\ I actually wrote a full song about it back in science class in which i had the most god awful sleep inducing retarded illiterate teacher. I dunno the band has 5 complete songs each 1 seems to represent a part of me now.    Insomniac:    Verse:  When and why  Was is it said  That working all day  Only to come home  And get no sleep again  Would help anyone  Do anything at all    Verse:  Who and How  Makes us all wake up  Too early is our sleep gone  From happy, to awake  No time to rest, and still tired  With no way to heal this loop    Verse:  Where and What  Are all these whispers from  It’s annoying  It’s mindless gossip, meaningless  No one knows about the world  And no one shuts up    Solo Intro:  Strike the Strings    Outro:  This clock is ticking on  Time is winding down  It’s almost to time to go  But there are so many hours until the night  And my eyes can no longer stand this light  I can’t wait to get out  To be happy and partying all night    Chorus:  Cause I’m an Insomniac  There’s no sleep at night for me  Cause I’m an Insomniac  The Sun is killing me  And because I’m an Insomniac  I’ve got no energy    So there, and another thing. My body is starting even reject music. I've been sitting here for a goddamn hour now trying to perfect Fade to Black by Metallica. BUT I KEEP MAKING A FUCKING MISTAKE. It's always at some random part, but I can never go through the chords without screwing up at least 1. Damnit, stupid fucking family. I'll get this eventually, the solo's the easy part. At least I have nice friends.... god i'm just frustratred i wanna just fucking yell and let it all out. I'll post the rest of my hell of a day later tonight.....       Many times I've loved  Many times been bitten  Many times I've gazed along the open road  Many times I've lied  Many times I've listened  Many times I've wondered how much there is to know  Many dreams come true  Many have silver lining  I live for my dreams and a pocket full of gold    Over the Hills and Far Away - Led Zeppelin  GO LISTEN TO THEM    -Mike

      Ok so I said i was gonna post later, I didn't lie =\. Here's the song from my "band" that fucking disbanded and now I've thrown back together. Only me and thomas were in the original set up. Oh well Damon's cool =\ he can definately stay and sing. Derek's just ..... derek =\ whatever I can't find a better bassist. And Elvy tries so whatever. Here's the song this site's about, it's the song that doesn't have much to do with me personally but conveys the emotions i feel towards my stupid family that gives me shit.  Sanctuary:   Verse:  Deep Underground, there lies a shadowless child  He wants to escape the waves of pain  But he couldn't find a good way, so instead... he took a fall  He protected his friends and put his life to an end    Verse:  Under his skin, there's a pain crawling  No one knew why he wanted to die  He used to keep all his emotions deep inside  Now it's too late and there's no turning back    Verse:  It was so overwhelming, more then he could bear  The pain, the agony was numbing  And it all got started by something stupid  And he had no way to get out    Outro:  If only there was a better way to end it all  Or no reason to crawl, on your knees screaming  In a time of peace and no war  We fight our own hell, inside our minds  The battlefield causes us to go crazy  And we all need a sanctuary, where we can hide    Chorus:  Sanctuary!  Let me run and hide  Sanctuary!  I wanna stay inside  Sanctuary!  It's where I cry  Sanctuary!  Before I commit suicide...    Eh =\ i wrote in math class back in like october and then came up with an 8 minute guitar line. people liked it, so whatever. now to close, if my parents somehow read this....  I WILL NOT GO TO MILITARY SCHOOL - FUCK OFF DAMNIT!

      So today let's recap? Woke up somewhat late, rested and feeling good. So then it began to rain, but despite that Hailen came over and I tried teaching her lead piano, to no avail, so i'm gonna teach classicly (songs) next time. But she was over for a bit, I felt happy. Thanks so much for the pasta "lunch" :p So I was pretty happy.  So afterwards while my parents go out, Frank comes over!! Jammed! Loved it!  I;m Back =D   -Mike

      Ok... so I haven't posted in a while, my fault right? WRONG!! My parents have gone above and beyond their call to make my life into a living hell.  So they drag away for 6 days, starting last monday which was the worst time possible... (why not earlier damnit!) So we get there, they give themselves each 300$ for food for 6 days but they forget to bring me money, so my mom is "nice" and gives me 20$ of hers. So let me clarify for all of you. For the last 6 days I've had to live off 20$ and tap water. I haven't showered since monday, cut my nails (which are now hideously long) since sunday.  Quebec City might have been enjoyable, but my parents destroyed all hopes of that. There were so many guitarists performing on the streets (as well as other musicians), as well artists and the view of the river was beautiful... Although I don't speak french very well I think, if I was there with virtually ANYONE else I would have at least enjoyed it, if not loved it. But NOOOOOOOOO my parents kill all hope of enjoyment. Shit... they went out of their way to insult me in public, and make it hell for me.  Maybe tommorow I might enjoy life again... we'll see I've just had to much time for reflection, I've over thought everythign about my feelings and who I am, I just sense bad things coming I guess... I hope not....   Why can't the Karma Police arrest my stupid parents.  -Mike
