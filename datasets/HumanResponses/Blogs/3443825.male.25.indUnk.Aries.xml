      Pain  why do I exist, on my own  it hurts like a fragmented bone  The worst black nightmare I scream blue  Without your touch I feel untrue  I need your touch, for this I dream I need your soul, to hold you near. with you near, my soul will beam without you here, my soul does tear  I know you are the one for me to be with you, will set me free life is not life, without you here and to lose you, my greatest fear.

      When i love you   And you love me   You make my heart turn to gold   You make my time with you golden   Our love is a gold crown   And when I am with you   Time stops

      I dream of the day of glorious you Like a goddess, my dreams worship Such beauty, men lose their breath your green eyes makes me frozen your brown hair, like flowing silk  such soft words, they float and stun your ambient air of love entraps me intoxication, liberation, purification my soul is free, my heart complete to be complete with you, a dream

      water washes with water like my soul with yours mixing, into a glorious sea filled by rivers of feelings and tears of joy  stirring a passionate storm that gives the sea a heartbeat as the waves slide together into a brilliant calm

      If my love for you was a stone  It is the strongest stone  It is the richest stone  It is the most beautiful stone  It is not a ruby  It is not even a diamond  But a stone of pure love  for that is what you deserve  It is unseeable by man  It is uncreatable by the gods  And I give this stone to you  as part of my love

      When I look at you My breath turns to perfume My soul springs from the desert Roses spring from the heart  When I love you The deserts have rain Flowers bloom, birds sing I was in pain before  When I touch you Sand turns to silk  souls merge together and together we sink into  The sea of silk

      How I desire my sweet red wine And how you make me feel The wine tasted from your lips to touch and feel your neck to feel your full body  to merge as one  drunk from your presence happy from our harmony How I desire my sweet red wine

      I sit and cry, your soul is missing  Nothing to touch, nothing to feel You are so far away, like gold from the rainbow, from eldorado shadows before me Glimpses behind me I hold my head in dispair sad that you, are not here like a frame with no picture I hang my sorry head wishing for your touch like the pollen needs the  wind

       Want   I need to feel your love  Like the wind feels the trees  to feel your warmth  like leaves feel the sun  to feel your soul  like the ghosts of ancient lovers  to feel your loving touch  Like the sea strokes the sand  to feel complete  like two perfect souls  in embrace, forever.

        Leaves    Words for you are not enough cliche written words of love  The words I want for you  are greater than love itself If I say,  I love you These words are like a  leaf in a forest,  I want to give you a tree I want to give you the forest My words fail me My love for you is a forest

      Spring  when our hearts first spoke The sleepy sun it awoke which pulled back the grey curtains  causing tears from the mountains  which made the trees grow to the sky this made the weeping willows cry this made the rabbits bound the birds sing beautiful sound young deer come to play That chase the grey days away all this growth, love and life when our hearts first spoke

      Her reflection, gazes at her,  in tribute to her admiration she wants, but she cannot have tempted, by that on display longing to have, like the apple her face floats, over glass ice  Ghosting from view to view  on a grey sunday afternoon Walking with windows

      I dream of you and me  under the cherry trees in full spring glory can you take me there? And love me there? to live in your eyes and sleep in your heart trees blossoming us in their crowing glory to be with you forever like the oyster with the pearl

      If I were, born a bird of my love, I would sing of my hopes, I would dream of life, i would give for you. Of search for you, i would go to fly over river and vale to glide over mountain and rock to hover over desert and sand to sail against tempest and tide to sing of my love to you

      I flip another coin  Into the well wishing you were here too long i have done this day after day week after week month after month sad time spent alone each day a lonely heart throwing another coin into the deep black well listening, watching it fall never hitting the bottom like these days never end

      when I see  the letters you  send to me I forget the paper I forget the pen and I dance with the words  when I see  your eyes  looking at me  I forget the sky I forget the earth and I dance with your soul

      My words fail you for when i say you are beautiful I mean to say a whole lot more for you deserve a whole new language for when i look at you rome is built in a day and the gods found new words of love in their forgery for these are the words I would give to you
