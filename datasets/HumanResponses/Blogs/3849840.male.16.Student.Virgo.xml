      So... Who should we invite?  Should we just invite everyone we know - or should we be mean about it? (I love being mean) We can't have everyone writing - ( then there would be no one left to read )  lol.  I think that we should maybe vote on people... Okay, so lets get some rules here:  [rules are subject to editing] 1. Member should post once a week. 2. Play nice.  [doesn't mean no cussing - just keep it professional] 3. Individual will not be invited if there is a problem with a current member (IE: if they just don't get along)  4. If two members don't get along - a vote will be held - one might get booted.  ... (this is starting to sound fun...) lol 5. Let's try and invite someone who brings positive energy to the group.  6. Let's invite people that will actually  write .  (I don't know about Jill, but I don't want to go through the trouble of sending them an invite only to have them be quite and never write anything.)  That's all I can think of.  eh.  (don't post a new entry to comment (let's actually use the comments below :P)

      Yeah, Jill.  My emails finnally were sent from  urlLink Blogger .  I guess they were just having server or mailing problems.  Anyway, I think the title should be renamed - but I can't really think of a name.    I still don't even know what this weblog can be used for...

I'm not asking you to sacrafice animals or anything... 4.An invitation will  mysteriously appear in your email . 5.fin.    1. Member should post once every two weeks. 2. Play nice. [doesn't mean no cussing - just keep it professional] 3. Individual will not be invited if there is a problem with a current member (IE: if they just don't get along)  4. If two members don't get along - a vote will be held - one might get booted. 5. If Jill doesn't like them and everybody else does... Too bad they can't play with us....(even if I do get along with them I can still secretly dislike them very much ahaha!) 6. This is not a personal weblog. [meaning you can't claim it as your own - because it is a group collaboration] However, post as often as you like... 7.Every member must have an updated profile.

      A hip young man goes out and buys the best car available: A brand new Ferrari GTO. He takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. &nbsp;An old man on a moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looks over at the sleek, shiny car and asks, "What kind of car ya' got there sonny?" &nbsp;The young man replies, "A Ferrari GTO. &nbsp;It cost half a million dollars!" &nbsp;"That's a lot of money," says the old man." Why does it cost so much?" &nbsp;&nbsp;"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!" states the young dude proudly. &nbsp;The moped driver asks, "Mind if I take a look inside?" &nbsp;"No problem," replies the owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Then, sitting back on his moped, the old man says, "That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!" &nbsp;&nbsp;Just then the light changes, so the guy decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! &nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly, &nbsp;&nbsp;WHOOOOOOSSSSSHHH! Something whips by him, going much faster! &nbsp;&nbsp;"What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. &nbsp;Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. &nbsp;WHOOOOOOOSHHHHH! He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Astounded by the speed of this old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not 10 seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again! The Ferrari is flat out, and there's nothing he can do! &nbsp;Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. &nbsp;The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive! He runs up to the mangled old man and says, "Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?" &nbsp;The old man whispers with his dying breath... "Unhook... my...suspenders... from... your... side-view mirror."

       Not  going to orientation.  Fat Granny is going to phone in my schedule changes/requests.  I  DARE  someone to screw it up.  I'm also going to see if I can  reserve  a parking spot/locker (i'll  GIVE THEM THE MONEY THEY SO CRAVE  via Alesha)  I feel that they could at least extend me that curtousy seeing my parking spot was un-avalible to me half of last year becuase of someone parking in it. :P  Also, my locker didn't have 'hooks' in it, dammit.

      OKAY.  "Orientation is July 27-seniors at 9, juniors at 10 and so on! and  lockers went up to $15  and  parking perments are $20!  Plus you have to pay any unpaid fees before you get your new scheduales!! "  Info. stolen from  urlLink Rachel .    Sigh, I really hate comming back to Anniston.  I'm just comming for the orientation and then i'm comming back. [PCB,FL] *giggles* Bringing Alesha back with me.  As Rachel found out when she came down with her church, sometimes I get extremely lonely.  Especially during the day when Fat Granny is at work. -_-

      Micah, why did you remove your entry?  I just want everyone to know I didn't do it.  (will never remove an entry) [only edits]  You have to keep in mind that I don't have a life- (contradicting myself)  -and I usually notice minute changes; such as an entry being removed.

      Hmm.. I have an idea.. everyone talk about something else..seems Micah and Jill won't be talking about anything though... they are too busy.. But anywho..  urlLink This article talks about people beating the login system on free registration sites   I actually use the Mozilla plugin for bugmenot.. It's a really good concept.. I hate being annoyed with registering stuff.. Just thought that you guys might be interested..

      I dug this comment up.  urlLink He was talking to me .    Matt said...  Hmm.. To trash something like that. Thats sad that you have absolutely nothing to look forward to or live for.  This is the best entry I've seen ~~~~   Things I am looking forward to, Matt:  *in order* urlLink Fullsail , turning 21 and getting completly drunk for the first time, getting laid, taking over the planet, etc. etc.  Things I live for: My family, my friends, coffee, coffee-flavored ice cream,  reading  urlLink bill's  weblog, argueing with idiots,  like you , on the internet,  etc. etc.  So don't say I've got nothing to live for, I have  plenty  of things/people to live for.  So go outside and hump a goat or whatever it is you do in your spare time...

      The heaviest element known to science is Managerium.  This element has no protons or electrons, but has a nucleus made up of 1 neutron, 2 vice-neutrons, 5 junior vice-neutrons, 25 assistant vice-neutrons, and 125 junior assistant vice-neutrons all going round in circles.  Managerium has a half-life of three years, at which time it does not decay but institutes a series of reviews leading to reorganization.  Its molecules are held together by means of the exchange of tiny particles known as morons.

      Look why dont yall just leave Micah alone? Yall know that I am undecided about all this stuff but still. Micah you came on to strong and yall dont down her religion... She said her piece and yall said yalls now can we go back to one happy blogger team!?!? Please! I respect what everyone said considering the circumstances but still It is just way to touchy of a subject to be goin on about... it can ruin friendships... believe me i know! But yeah.. thats all im gonna say about that subject! Oh and does anyone know what day orientation is? Id appretiate (sp?!) it if yall told me.... cuz i dont ever go by the school to see... love yall! -Me

      look.. for all of you who don't think i am stupid: I am not gonna put what i believe on here bc&nbsp;i know that you don't want to hear it and if you did you would ask me.. you all know my email.. if not  urlLink KonaKia916@aol.com  there ya go.&nbsp;  and i agree with Tim that we not talk about our different religions on here . bc it only makes someone angry or it just pushes them away.&nbsp;so.. if anyone does want to ask me or tell me that you hate me for expressing my feelings than feel free. you all know that i am a devout Christian and I always will be. so don't email me and tell me that i am a bad person or that "I don't understand!" thank you for you time! *hugs*

        Ok, this needs to be said. Everyone shut up about the religious bullshit and keep your opinions to yourself. I'm tired of coming on here and religious arguements is all I see. Everyone believes in different things.  Everyone  thinks they are right.&nbsp; No one knows for sure. No one, Micah. Christianity is no different from other religions in terms of belief. Do you not think other religions have holy sacred documents and shit too? I could sit here and argue about my truths, and what I believe in.. But I won't. There is no point. No one is going to change from one of our rants, so we might as well waste time on something else.&nbsp;So did you catch my drift? If not, here it is, condensed: Shut the hell up about your stupid religions, no one wants to hear it.

      i meant to mention this....ppl are soo decieved b/c they think that sayin a prayer will get them to Heaven...its not about the prayer...its about surrendering your whole life to God...i mean he gave it to you....so give it back to him....i am not saying you cant have fun..hey i am all about having some fun...just understand that God is looking for a generation to stand up for him...to love him...he just wants to come and dwell with his ppl..but we have shut him out...dont shut him out no more..its time to kick off the coffin top and get outta that grave.....God isnt boring he doesnt want us to sit in a pew and stand up and sing your fav. song then sit down then the pastor preach the same message....he wants us to be radical..if yall could have just been there...if you coulda seen how all 2000 teenagers were responding to God...i mean screaming, dancing, singing, crying, lifting their hands..it was awesome...worship is the only way to defeat the Devil..it makes him tremble....he knows what kinda worship God wants....remember the Devil use to be the worship leader in Heaven but he wanted to be greater than God he wanted worship so he was sent to hell and&nbsp;he pulled that worship outta Heaven and perverted it...as you see on MTV.  &nbsp; Dancing was made to worship God....how can you be at a football game or watching a concert by Britteny Spears...and scream your head off and dance and jump up and down...and then come to church and sit in a pew and just sing a little song and sit down....God wants you to worship him and love him with all your heart...please understand that....and if you dont or if you have any questions feel free to ask me...i want to help you....i love you with alllll my heart and soul........

PLEASE!! I am begging you....dont let the world control you..i know you dont think it is but think of this....if your not serving God then who are you serving? Yourself? The World? The Devil?? Well if you said yes to any of these...then your serving the Devil its one or the other....God or Devil...there is no in between...but God loves you....he sent his ONLY son for you...do you understand what that means....Jesus beared all your sin just so you would have the chance of going to Heaven....he was beat...it says in the Bible that you could even tell he was human...then he was nailed on the cross and hung there for 3 hours and died...his lungs collapes..all for you......he loves you so much....and he just wants you to love him but the Devil, he hates you...he wants you to die and if he could right now he would come outta hell and drag you down there with him....he desipes you..he just wants you to suffer....but its your chose no one else can choose for you....and i am just telling you this so now your blood isnt on my hands....if yall want to know more about God and want to live for him then ask me about it....email me or im me...do something..my email is&nbsp;~~~~>  urlLink crimsongrl08@hotmail.com  but has i said if yall hate me then thats ok too...but i Love you with all i am........

      Okay, by now you have noticed the new posting thingy.  Blogger staff had the following to say about it:  We've just released a new-fangled version of Blogger that'll let you fancify your posts using a feature-rich text editor. Go forth and align, colorify and embolden your words.  But remember, with great power comes great stylistic responsibility.    Notice the part I made bold. :P   Oh, also google bought the picasa company! yay! [The people that make hello]  Anyway, you can now  urlLink get a free copy of picasa .  I haven't tried it... But i'll likely do that later tonight.

Can you put pictures on here now without having to use Hello?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, Rick wants me to start posting the comics that I've made. He says they're funny but y'all will probably think otherwise..&nbsp; I'll post some later, I guess. I'm worried about the ACT.. I need to take it. But I have to go help my mother with the groceries.. Bye all.&nbsp;&nbsp; -=Tim=-

      Well I suppose I should post then so I don't anger Jill the Almighty. This blog thing has grown larger than I had.. hoped. I didn't check it for 2 days and there seemed to be about 10 new posts.. and 2 new members. Guess I have to try to get off the phone with Vickie more often to come check up on things.. Thank you for your time.    -=Tim=-

      My little bit of comment for the day: I'm not ready!! College starts up in September and I'm so not wanting to start classes. All of you who still have a year left should be greatful. Atleast you know people in your classes. I'll be alone in every one of mine. That's all for now. I just wanted to say I finally found my invite (stupid Spam Patrol) and am here to play!

      I feel compelled to tell you the purpose of this group weblog.  It is a place to share your thoughts, experiences, photos, comics, or poetry in a more mainstream or public environment.  This isn't anything official.  Just a little project that Jill and I started in our spare time over the summer.  I think it will be fun to read after we graduate; well, assuming everyone posts like they should.    The main thing to remember is to share what's on your mind with others.  And, as long as you do that-  you can't be wrong; Because, it's  your  oppinnion.  And, no one can take that from you.

      I just wanted to say thanks for welcoming me in. I'm glad to be part of this which will usher in a new era of boredom and pointless paragraphs.  Really though, this feels important.. Like it's going to be our last piece of communication between eachother before we go off into our own lives. Let this live on. Thank you and goodnight.

      Jill, I think we should just invite everyone for  one  week. (we give them a week of opportunity, to ask for an invite)   then  we can be picky.  I don't think it really should have anything to do with school anymore - although, school will likely be a constant topic.    My week (that I will invite anyone) Starts this  Wednesday, 7th  and it ends on  Wednesday, 14th .  So if you reading this (and it's between those days,  sigh  I will invite you)    ** Note: The only requirments (for me) is that you place a pic on your profile.  And, that you  urlLink follow these rules .    ***  urlLink Rick, shut up and let me ask for an invite...

      No, no, and no! Well just for now. We are trying to figure out what exactly this site is going to be used for, and when we figure it out we'll let you know. I don't want to add people and then find out that they have nothing to say, or that they make oodles of grammatical errors (I would have to kill you!). All that I know is that I want something with substance, we don't want to know every detail of your day! So if that’s all you have to say, don’t even think about asking… I want students (or former students) to be able to express themselves...is that so much to ask?!!

      I've been thinking.  To hell with it.   No , I won't be adding anyone until school starts.  (if I add anyone then - ...probably will)  If you ask me, your barking up the wrong tree.  Been getting a couple of requests for membership to the blog.  The thing is:  ( being brutally honest here )    "You might not write the kinda stuff we're looking for."   Jill and I haven't even begun to decide who we're letting in - I know one thing, "we sure as hell can't let everyone in." :(  Sorry.    If you don't like how slow we're progressing with this "project".   urlLink Start your own .  Don't ask me for help, tho. >0

      but this year might not be so bad. Except I have only one class with Danna and none with Meagan. *gr* It's not so bad really. My lunch class is ok and in music appreciation we might study about the Renaissance eventually and stuff like that interests me a great deal. Plus I have Mrs Norton this year, so.. yay.

      Hello. It's Katie (or Jessie Adams's little sister-for those of you who have no earthly idea as to who I am). As you can tell, I received an invite to the blog. *searches for something to say...* Well, I don't think my scheldule would interest any of you since none of the other contributors are in my grade. It has to be changed anyway. They put me in percussion band. *sighs* I just hope they can get it right in less than 2 new scheldules (unlike last year.)  -insert dull silence- ...  Wow, such an interesting post. Hopefully I'll have more to say later.

      What would you do if you woke up in the middle of the night and had to go to the bathroom.  When you get to the bathroom you smell a foul stench.  You open the door and a hairy fat stranger is sitting on your toilet taking a slam, reading your newspaper, and drinking your coffee.  What do you do?

        Well since no one has posted in a while I figured I'd just waste some time.. School is almost here again.. I'm actually looking forward to it.  My schedule looks very easy.. I have a locker next to Kyle.. It's going to be weird without any upper-classmen here.. I'm gonna miss some of the seniors... But hey, they're livin the life now...   Anyway,  Rick, are you back from Florida yet? Wish you would have come to orientation.  Oh well. I'm done wasting time now.  Goodbye.
