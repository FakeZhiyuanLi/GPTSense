       Ground Control is a game franchise that's different from everything I've ever played. There's no bases, the infantry is useful, and the artillery is a major weapon. I like the idea of the infantry being able to kill things, and the no base thing. However the artillery can be a problem. A  major  problem. It's just the first of some huge balance problems.  I don't want to get into a story about a ground control game, because it's all the same and very boring to read. So, instead I will give you a pros/cons column:                 Pros                   Excellent grapics        Spectacular camera        Easy to move camera        Control scheme is easy to pick up        Infantry can take out vehicles        The firing and explosion effects look good        The vehicles take more damage from the sides/back        The Landing Zone and Victory Location system is intuitive                    Cons                   The artillery have a  very  long range        You need to constantly keep your units moving        Some units are overpowered and overarmored        The 16-unit selection limit        The dropship upgrades are underused        The balance is TERRIBLE        Everybody online is better than you        When I say the balance is terrible, we're not talking one side is better than the other. I'm saying that you only need to build 4 types of units, the rest having no effect. If you build Rocket Terradynes, Ravager Terradynes, Artillery, and a few Combat Engineers you will have no trouble. In fact, if there was a game type where a point was placed in the game and the goal was to build the most Ravagers by then, it would pretty much mimic what the winning players do. I'm not joking.  Beyond that, there's not a lot to say. Yeah, it's a good game, but it really,  really  depends on what you like. For lots of people, this is going to be one rockin game. For me? not so much.   Ratings  Graphics: 10 This game looks great, even on low end computers. It runs well, and it runs well on systems below the minimum specs. The explosions, firing effects, models, everything looks excellent.  Sound: 8 All the sounds are solid, and I like how some things sound different as you get farther away. There's nothing spectacular about them though.  Network Performance: 9 This is no surprise. There is little to no lag, and the worst performance gets down to is some occasional stutters.  Gameplay: 6 It's fun, sometimes. But the balance is thrown off and most of the matches are the same.   Features: 7 The secondary mode feature is very helpful. Plus, you can call in airstrikes, battlefield sensors, and smoke grenades. There's nothing to really phone home about though.  Overall: 6.5 I have to say, I like  the game in spite of some of its flaws. And, it's not nearly as bad as Warcraft 3. However, suffice to say that I don't like it to the tune of fifty dollars.

       I think Fridays have a bad effect on me. I always feel down about work on Friday, and then I feel pretty good about it on Saturday. Maybe it's just that I need to work two extra hours that day. I dunno.  Today's been pretty good. Getting two systems moved out and another almost done. I think a major contributor to my good feeling is the hour-long lunch I took. Maybe strawberry milk, but my idealisms on that are for another day. Maybe tonight. I'm going to take an hour for lunch every work day now.   When I get home this evening I'm going to play some Ground Control 2. Still the demo, though. I want to write up a review on it, but it feels kind of odd reviewing a demo. I'll probably get some time late night to do so. It's an excellent game, and I plan to buy it someday. Someday when I have enough money.  I've had time to think today, and I have come to the conclusion that I like the high gas prices. I would not, in fact, mind if they went higher. It's causing many people to conserve gas, rather than have two cars and use one to drive to the garage and back. Maybe far, far into the future, we Americans will give up SUVs for  efficient  vehicles. It seems like many people, rather than get more fuel efficient cars, just want to bitch about gas prices. There was a fat man on Comedy Central who was just yelling about how he wanted cheap gas from a good place. What an ass.  I'll get back to you when I get home.

       I wonder if Don King has trademarked that phrase? He should.  Some days I think I have a great job, some days I just want to quit. It varies, but I usually have one good day for every 3 "I'm quitting" days. I know it's a good job for me, but I take a lot of flak from people who just kind of feel like yelling because they don't know what else to do. The guy who was yelling at me today is actually one of the nicest guys I know, but when I told him that Jetta was going to charge 140 bucks for a laptop battery and next-day shipping, he was not happy. Not happy at all. To be fair he's already had to replace the motherboard and CD/DVD-ROM drive, but that was under warranty. Still, all that stuff going bad isn't right. I wouldn't be as annoyed by it, but he told me that it was my fault he had to pay so much, that we did poor work, (Even though we have NO part in the construction of these laptops) and that he would never buy anything from us again. However, he bought two Jetta laptops through us at the same time, same model. The other one has not been in our shop since the day it was bought. It seemed pretty ridiculous, now and even at the time. You tend not to laugh in that kind of situation though. It seems like I've been the target of a lot of bitching lately. Tally one for the "I'm quitting" pile.  On the home front, two of my uncles and one aunt are in town. The uncles, they're cool. One of them brought us a pottery wheel and a kiln. He's teaching my nephew and I how to make cups, bowls, and generally anything radially symmetric. I may get back to you on that. I'm pretty excited, and if I can finally scrounge up the money for a digital camera, I'll send pictures. For now, I'm going to bed. I have a feeling work is going to suck tomorrow.

       You need to see this movie. Now. Go.  This is one of the better movies I've seen. The CG scenes are mind-blowing. I don't want to give away too much, but scenes like NYC freezing from the top down and the massive hail in Japan are simply amazing. There is only one conclusion: go see The Day After Tomorrow.  I'm not going to do an overview or a synapsis because I don't want to give anything away. It's an excellent movie and I don't want to spoil anything about it. I went with a friend, and before we went outside, we were both thinking it was going to be cold. I thought: "Damn I wish I would have brought my jacket. Going to have to run to the car." It was a  completely  unconsious thing. I honestly and completely believed that it was going to be cold out. I think that speaks for itself. Go   See   This   Movie.

       I'm going to go see The Day After Tomorrow. I heard it was pretty good, and even had some liberal messages to boot! I'll give an overview and final thoughts on it when I get back.  It's been a pretty quiet day. I went to work for a while, to help get caught up. Tons of service calls, most of them little 5 minute jobs. Fairly pleasant overall.

       I was very happy about getting my graphics card fixed and having everything  running. Staying up all night to do so was no big deal, I thought. I dont'  have to work tomorrow, I'll just take a nap this afternoon. Nope.  At 9AM Gabe from CompTech calls me and says Matt called in sick. You need to  work today.  What the hell is that. So I took a nap this morning amounting to about 4  hours and headed off to work at 2. Now not only am I tired and pissed off  like I thought I would be, but now I'm tired and pissed off while I work on  peoples' computers. No fun here. My boss even bitched at me how computers  were moving slow when I'm only here 2 of 6 days a week. And last weekend I  was tied up mostly with getting backed up files onto a laptop. This guy only  knew what he wanted back on there. Not where it was, not what it was called,  he didn't understand what I was doing, and I didn't have any clue what he  wanted. I got him all fixed up, but it sucked up most of my hours. But  computers aren't moving, and it's my fault.  I wonder if Safeway is hiring?

       After a night of moderate tinkering, I have fixed my graphics card. It came down to some Intel MB drivers from Gigabyte. As I write, I am installing Halo PC. Maybe, just maybe, I will be able to run it on this machine.  With a good framerate.  Don't tell anyone, I may become the target of assasination.  I decided to reset my sleep schedule so I can actually get to bed at an hour that humans here normally do. To do so I embarked on a journey to completely screw my sleep pattern up. By staying awake all night, this I have accomplished. I may be kind of an asshole today. Ok, a really big asshole. But tonight I'm going to be tired. Tired like I haven't been in ages. And then I can go to bed.  Early.   I've been playing BFV, BF1942, C&C Generals, the Ground Control Demo, and the Joint Ops demo. If the graphics become particularly impressive I will hook you guys up with some screenshots. I think you'll get a few from Halo. I will be writing that Ground Control Demo review today as well. I like only working on Fridays and Saturdays, but damn it gets boring. Be back later! (I apologise in advance for all the assholishness that may ensue.)

       The BF LAN today was great. We had 4 people here, and it worked out well. Due to my rage at Japanese carrier plane campers, we devised this tactic:   urlLink      I was on Axis at the time, with the 3 others being on the Allies. (This is Wake Island) I simply grounded the carrier, and left a truckload of targets for the other 3 guys. If you have never played Battlefield 1942 I highly recommend it. It's not for the simulation set, but it is a lot of fun and the online play is smooth, fast, and entertaining.

       I can't get over how beautiful this game is. It's got a superb camera, excellent graphics, and the artillery fire is stunning. I took these screens throughout the course of an online game last night:   urlLink    When aircraft go down, the debris flies all over.   urlLink    The artillery explosions are fantastic.   urlLink    The artillery also looks great in-flight.   urlLink    The water looks fantastic in this game, possibly the best I've ever seen.   urlLink    The dropships are fascinating. You can upgrade them in all sorts of categories.   urlLink    I love how you can look up at the sky, and actually have somthing worthwhile there. This screenshot doesn't really do the actual thing justice.  If I get some spare time tomorrow, I'll write up a review of this game. We've got a LAN party tomorrow afternoon so I don't know if I'll get to it. Probably sometime in the evening.  This Hello/Bloggerbot thing is great for images. It not only posts images  directly  to your blog, it even hosts them. It's stupendous. If you have a Blogger blog, there's really no other way to get images onto your site.

       Wingman and I just finished playing a game of the Ground Control 2 Demo. It seems like we're either getting beat into the ground, or in a dead stalemate. The game we were playing was a 45 minute stalemate. The general loop was:    Fire artillery, crush enemy attack  Get artillery shot  Counter second half-assed enemy attack with tanks  Attack, have units crushed  Buy more artillery  Fire artillery, crush enemy attack   And so on and so forth. After 45 minutes of this, you're enjoying not losing, but it kind of sucks. Neither team had the skills or the AP (aquisition points) to launch an effective attack. After some more time with this game, I will write you folks a review. Until then,  urlLink give this game a try . It's kind of entertaining, and if you like RTS games it's an excellent way to spend some time.

        Note: This first part is just my story of Joint Ops, you can skip down to the "Ratings" part for the final word.   I don't know, but many of you have probably heard about Novalogic's new game, Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising. I downloaded the demo from Fileplanet (Yes, I subscribe) and here are my impressions:  When I got the Joint Ops demo, I was pretty excited about it. While I was downloading, I read a couple previews of the game, and it sounded good:      "With our tour of the game out of the way, we finally got to get in some multiplayer action on two maps we hadn't seen before - "Pulau Raya Volcana" and "Padang River Basin." Both maps were played in Advance and Secure mode, with the second having an accelerated time-of-day setting - we could see the sun moving through the sky and shadows shifting around the map after just a few minutes." -GameSpy   and   "Even though they take place outdoors, Joint Operations' close-quarters battles seem to have the same pacing you might expect from a traditional tactical game--slowly creeping toward a goal with your teammates on overwatch, punctuated by quick firefights that are better fought with a low-power silenced weapon, like a silenced MP5 submachine gun. However, its vehicular battles are extremely varied--we saw plenty of different battle scenarios, including air-to-sea battles between Little Birds with gunners hanging off the side shooting their infantry weapons at Zodiacs piloted by engineers with antiair rocket launchers, ground assaults using armored vehicles with air support, and many others." -GameSpot   So, obviously, I was pretty anxious to get going with this game. After installation, I logged onto NovaWorld and looked for a server. Seeing games that supported 100 people was pretty impressive, seeing them full was more so. I chose a 53/64 game, and commenced loading.  The first thing I have to say is that the loading time is unexpectedly quick for as large and as detailed as this map is. [+10 points] The next thing I noticed was that the game had MANY ways to get where you were going, and they were all pretty entertaining. I hopped on a little bird piloted by Marine003 and he dropped me at Objective B. It was pretty intense.  There was a sniper up on the hill, which promptly shot the man next to me. With a 50 caliber bullet. Priority One-Run like hell. I ran for the bunker, and was greeted by angry men with knives and guns. Running away, I was sliced and died near a road. A nearby medic somehow healed my fatal wounds and I was back in the fight. I shot at some things with my M4 and was shot back at. Does this count as death one or two?  Back at the default base, I realize something. Half our team is camping the little birds. And since Marine003 was keeping the transport bird to himself, they were camping one helicopter. If you are not familiar with the map, the Joint Ops team base has a hill beyond one of the entrance/exit bridges. This hill lines up VERY well with the helo spawns. My team would just mob the helicopter, getting cut down all the way by snipers. Some would fire in the  general  direction of the hill, but not at anything specifically. So, I run off in a pretty cool looking Recon Buggy. By this time, the sun has set, and the Rebels are beating the crap out of us.  I don NVGs and blow past a group of our guys having a knife fight. Why are they fighting? I don't know but my guesses go in this order: OK, I lied. I don't have any guesses. After a another punctual death at the hands of Rebels, (What are these guys rebelling against?) the lag is becoming unbearable. I leave the server in search of another.  The rest of the evening is dotted with trying to find a server that can run without lag, and with out lots of asshats. The lag is a constant, and the asshats, they're not going anywhere. Where do all of these 14 year olds with DSL come from? I gave up at about midnight (I had started at circa 9:30) and played some Pandora Tomorrow. Hopefully the full game doesn't end up like this.   Ratings  Graphics: N/A My graphics card (Gainward GeForce FX5600) is on it's way out. I have to run at 1024x768 with all detail at low to get  acceptable  framerates. I cant be the judge on graphics.   Sound: 6 The sounds themselves are pretty mediocre. Yeah, they sound like guns, and that's about it. One thing I did like, however, was the very distict sounds between the Joint Ops and Rebel forces guns. You definitely know who's shooting at you. And believe me, your teammates will shoot at you.  A lot.   Network Performance: 3 It's crap. That's the only thing to say for it. Every server is laggy, and it's not just me. If this doesn't improve, the full game will be a complete flop.  Gameplay: 8 I really enjoyed the game when I could get some time with real players, not 14 year old fools. I like the piloting system, if you can manage to get a plane. Think BF1942 but  worse . Yes, it can happen. The minimap is nice, and I especially like how it shows were enemy fire is coming from. The vehicles are nifty, with the three gears, and getting around and fighting can be very pleasant, depending on who you play with.  Features: 9 There are tons of cool things that Novalogic presents a player with. My favorite has to be the already mentioned display of where fire is coming from. But there is also the command menu, the super-medic, the multi-gear vehicles, auto-run, and the in-vehicle chat system. They're all very handy, and they aren't wasted.  Overall: 6.5 The gameplay and features definitely make this game playable. The lag issues, lackluster sounds, and the overflow of asshats takes away a good portion of it, bringing it down to 6.5. If they can take care of the lag and encourage more team-based play in the full version, this game will be a solid 8.

       Hey, you're probably here by mistake, so  urlLink here's a link  to get you where you were probably going.  But seriously, welcome to The Off-White House. I plan to post notes, rants, and reviews of things I come into contact with throughout my life. I'll post up some real content here soon, and maybe if you're lucky, it will be good. I'll check back in soon, see ya.

       I'm at work right now. I'm leaving here in a short while, and I'll be heading back home. Once there, I'm going to call people and get everything in order for tomorrow. I'm going to have to get up early if I want to have everybody here by 11. Nine is way too early.  I've got all the details I'm going to work out for scene one worked out, and the filming should go smoothly tomorrow. Like a well tuned rocket, I say. We probably won't get all of Scene 1 done. Hell, I doubt if we'll get most of it done. The main purpose of this session is just to get everybody acquainted with DCME and the movie process. We haven't done anything like it yet, so this should be a little tough getting everything going.  I'll do a short writeup on how tomorrow goes after it's all said and done.

       I though I would share this little tidbit from our production resources:   urlLink    Extra points if you can tell me what the map is.  If you follow the  urlLink DC Resource  link on the left and pick up the Navy SEALs movie, you'll notice similarities between this movie and theirs. I like what they've done and picked up some ideas from the way DCR did their movie. Same premise-a few guys shooting a bunch of other guys. I'm shooting for the end of the month as the release date for this movie. I think I'll bite the bullet and upload it to FilePlanet this time. Ugh. That will take hours.  Beyond that, work is keeping my busy most of the time. Just as things begin to quiet down, they pick back up again. No fun there. I swear, the next person who wants me to figure out what is wrong with his computer and tell him how to fix it over the phone is going to get...I don't know but it will be, but it will be A)painful and B)ah hell, I don't know. I'm going to bed.

       We worked out the details of scene one today and yesterday, and I'm hoping to get the bulk of it filmed Saturday evening and Sunday. I'm at work right now, but I'm headed off on a service call and will be going home after that.  If you plan on making a movie, there's no better tool for doing so than BF1942/Desert Combat/BFV Movie Edition mods at  urlLink Battlefield NL . They have a 6th position in every vehicle that is a camera based around the vehicle, and 4 movement speeds of camera. I don't know how we ever made movies without it. Plus, this movie will be captured with FRAPs, meaning higher resoloution.  I assure you, this movie will be certifiably bad ass in all, ok most, respects.

       It's late, I should really go to bed. I am driven though.  Right now, I'm just letting the creative engine go forth on idle while I work out some details and become familiar with the music. Once I'm synced up with the music, the movie making should go much easier. I'm listening to Hector's Death over and over, getting ideas of how I want to set it up. The very first part of the movie where this plays will be very crucial to catch the attention of an audience. When we shift into the action sequence with Backseat Driver, it will be less important. I really can't wait to get going on this.  I'm going over some of our scene selections right now, and I think that plenty of work still needs to be done, but no surprises there. The only major thing I really want to spend some time mending is the transitional phase between scenes 2, 3, and 4. Granted, we've only gotten to the very basics for scene 3, and barely any on 4. However, even now it seems very rough. Literally pulled along by the threads of rock music and pushed by some intuitive fades. With time, with time.

       I spent the better portion of the day working on the plans for our new movie. I did some work last night, and I think it's coming out well. Right now, we have 3 scenes blocked out and some maps and music. So far we'll be using:  Maps    DC Urban Siege  Basra  Operation Bragg   Music    Hector's Death (Troy Soundtrack)  Backseat Driver (007: Tomorrow Never Dies Soundtrack)  All Along the Watchtower (Jimi Hendrix)  So far, it's coming along very well, and I hope to have all the filming and post-production done by August. I don't want to give away details, so I won't be saying much. However, I can say that it will be similar in ways to the  urlLink Navy SEALs  movie done by the (I assume) British DC Resource. It's a pretty whopping movie. It's excellent though.  I'm going to go scope out the maps a little more. I may be back later in the evening.

       It's was my mom's birthday yesterday, and we got her a DVD player. I picked up Die Another Day for her, the widescreen special edition. The movie itself is awesome, and it really helped me learn a little more about movie making. However, the special features on this thing just blow me away. There's a part on the 2nd disc where they show raw footage from different cameras, and that has been a major help. The camera angles and setup are just impeccable, and I'm learning from that. Already I'm getting ideas for sequences.  I'm going to try and setup a small movie LAN tomorrow, just for prelim footage and some brainstorming ideas. I want to find a map that suits what we are doing well, so we can get a large amount of footage shot without having to change gears. It should work out well, and then we can do the full shots in two or three more sessions. I'm pretty excited about the whole thing.  I found some awesome fonts and an excellent color of orange at the same time. The two combined and compelled me to make some intro setups. This is the main title screen:  urlLink    The orange comes across better in a .gif file.  It's jokey but I like it. I will probably retool it some to make it more professional sometime in the future. I'll keep you updated.

       I like not having to work most of the week. It gives me the benefit of having money, yet I still have plenty of time to do things I want. It's an excellent system.   If you have never checked out  urlLink Goats  you should really give it a look. The artist has skill, and many of the comics have some political undercurrent. My personal favorite, so far, is the "Jesus Loves Dick" [Cheny] cartoon.  We'll be doing a movie LAN party tomorrow, I'll update you as this movie progresses. A movie webpage is in the works, showing off our content. We've made 3 major movies and lots of shorts from movie footage. This movie will probably be "filmed" across two to three sessions. I should probably explain to you what we do: We assemble everybody at my house or place of work. I then hook my USB Video Capture Device up to my computer and take footage from a few different computers. I save all these clips and then hack them together using Windows Movie Maker, although I plan on buying some better software soon. I'm not sure between Pinnacle Studio 8 or Ulead Video Studio. I think for the capture this time, I will run  urlLink FRAPS  on my computer and another. Then, I will be able to do the camera shots and I can get two different angles on a scene.  Right now, I'm going to bed as I'll have a busy day tomorrow.

       I finally finished getting all of my basic programs, utilities, etc. back onto my computer. I'm defragging as we speak. This machine should blaze through BFV and Generals now. If you haven't played Battlefield Vietnam or Command & Conquer Generals, you are really missing out. Those games are probably my two favorites for PC. I'm too tired to really string any more coherent sentences together, so I'll get back to you tomorrow. Well today, but know you mean I what.

       My computer's been running slow, so I finally decided to do my 4 month reload. It keeps things running smoothly and quickly. After this reload, I'm just going to make a Ghost image. Ghost, for those of you who don't know, is a program that compresses the data on your hard drive and saves it on to CD-Rs, DVDs, or another partition on your hard drive. Plus, restoring an images takes about 30 minutes, rather that 2-3 hours for getting a clean load going.  It's a good Sunday, don't have much on the plate and I don't plan on doing much. After reloading everything I need, I'm probably going to do a little work on the pottery wheel. Last night, I made a goblet. It's the first thing I've been able to make! It's a little lopsided, but I don't mind. It's pretty hard to do. By the time I'm a Senior (After this school year) I should be able to breeze through ceramics class. Well, I'd best get going with the reload.

       If you've never noticed, Raisin Bran is good. It may even make you  urlLink feel great .  I've finally got everything backed up. I cloned my hard drive onto a 40 GB drive a couple hour ago, so hopefully nothing will be lost when I send in the drive. The odd thing though, is that the symptoms have largely resided. I've gotten a couple bad sectors the past couple of days, but no clicking or freezing. Too late now I guess.  I'm working on getting this IDE 40 GB drive to work in this machine. I don't know what the problem is, but it freezes on drive detection when the 40 gig is the main drive. It shall be fixed. I hope.  Tomorrow I have a nice long day of cleaning to look forward to. I'll do my regular job from 11 to when I come back from lunch. I'll put a "Closed for July 4th" notice on the door and get most of the junk moved down into the basement and everything else organized. That's going to be  lots  of fun.   The movie is officially in limbo until I get a refurb drive back from Seagate. Since they just send you a refurb drive straight off, I would think that this shouldn't be too long of a wait. I'm crossing my fingers that they have run out of the drive model I have and will need to send me an upgraded drive. Slim chance, but there's always luck.  I'll be back here from work tomorrow afternoon. Ahhh work, I wish they would pay me. I'm off to bed so I can get there on time tomorrow.

       We did manage to get a little bit of footage taken care of yesterday, and I am fairly satisfied with it. All this was done despite a rain and hail storm and one guy dropping out on us. It was not efficient, but it was productive.  I was going to go in and do a little bit of work today. Simple in shop jobs, and backing things up off of my failing hard drive. Then comes a service call to check out some printing problems at the B&A Tax Office. I spent four hours working on this thing. It was a 367 Mhz Celeron with 256 RAM running Windows XP Pro. I wouldn't have minded it so much, but more than 75% of my time was spent waiting for it to do things. The icing on the cake, however, is that I had to constantly listen to three women gossiping while they sealed envelopes. All day.  As a side note, you should try out  urlLink The Dead Case . It's an excellent flash game that I found interesting.   I'm off to bed, have to be to work at nine tomorrow.

       One word for today: overripe. Most of it was good, but we still had to cut plenty off.  I was only able to corral 2 people over here today, but we got some work done. Many of the action and special effects scenes got finished up. However, looking through them I see that we'll have to redo maybe 1/4 of the shots. Damn.  Tomorrow we'll do some work as well, doing mostly the tedious work where we need 4-5 people. I hope to have scene one wrapped up in 2 more shoots, but that will all be played by ear.  Here's a picture from my favorite shot we did today.   urlLink      It's a screenshot of the movie playing fullscreen, so the quality is bad.  I think I'll go work on some pottery, I'll be back.

       There is nothing more satisfying that making a really good pot, cup, bowl, or what have you. It's just an awesome feeling to know that you took that piece of wet dirt and made something great. It takes patience, however, so 98% of the United States is out. But anyway.  I'm really amped about getting some filming done tomorrow. We'll have 5 people over here and get some of scene one eaten away. By the end of the day, I'm hoping that we'll have enough done for me to make a short promo in Windows Movie Maker. It's underpowered but it gets the job done.  You know the details, I'll be back when this is all over.

       I had to call off the shoot for today, mainly because of a lack of people. However, it gave me time to blow things up. A friend of mine and I armored up some cardboard and fireworks battleships with aluminum foil and duct tape and set them loose on each other. In the end they were both burned to pieces. However, the foil survived surprisingly well. There's nothing like fireworks to brighten your day.  A friend of ours came back from Canada. I don't know what he was doing up there, but I assume it was something to do with music. I think I'll be casting him for the part of Sgt. Colin Gregory. We should be able to get a shoot in, depending upon whether we can get another person in for filming. We'll do a 5-person setup, with me doing camera angles. Right now, things are fairly simple. Not being able to show any more than 4 people at a time is rather limiting. I suppose we'll find a way, however. (Please  urlLink e-mail me  if you would like to be an extra. We can set up an internet server and use Teamspeak.)  God damn these terrible moths. God damn them.

       Well we're still going, but I don't think we'll get anything done by last call. All was looking good: we had three people here, everything was ready. Our fourth person was about 45 miles out of town, and he'd be here within an hour. Then this storm comes out. Out of nowhere, it's raining like crazy, with dime size hail. The hail let up after about 10 minutes, but the rain kept going. Our fourth (and neccessary) person had to pull over and wait out the rain, so he could see well enough to drive. This wouldn't bother me as much, but this same thing happened at last week's LAN party. Sudden rain, severe thunderstorm warning, and one fizzled LAN party. I guess there was a tornado warning this time.  The only major achievement I've made today is figuring out the remote console and remote admin functions for battlefield. And that's like a 20 minute job. Woo.  By the way, that house in the picture isn't mine.

       Old computers have an odd allure to me. I really enjoy fixing them up and making them work. I don't know what it is, but I can't resist them. That's how this whole server thing came about. I got this computer from a dark corner of my room, and thought: "I wonder if I could get a good Battlefield server running on this." The short answer: yes.  I started out on this yesterday afternoon. At 4AM today, I had a functioning (LAN) server. I have yet to see how it runs on the internet. In the process of all this, I installed some Linux programs (which I am very proud of doing) and changed the system from this AMD to an Intel processor, and then back again. I also learned the hard way Anime unleashed is the only thing on TV after 2. And even then, that's only until 3. After that, paid programming as far as the eye can see. I checked Discovery, G4TechTV, History, Comedy Central, ABC, CBS, NBC, TLC, and Fox. On the upside, I could be making $50,000 a week, sell my timeshares for cash, lower my credit card debt, stop smoking overnight, and have a gigantic penis. I think that's an offer I can't afford to miss out on (refusing).  Another LAN today, and I have a groundbreaking idea! I'll be back tonight (or tomorrow morning) with my idea and all things informative from the LAN party.

       It's been a while since I've made a post, but don't worry, I have an excuse. Sunday was, of course, dominated by grilling and fireworks. Monday I felt like crap so I just took it easy all day. It's still Tuesday according to my sleep schedule so we're all caught up.  I've been playing a lot of Rainbow 6 3 tonight. It's is a superb game. The most fun aspect of the game would have to be the overall tactical feel. The entire game experience just sucks you into the world of counter-terrorism. Plus, it's just plain bad ass to go tactical. There's no better feeling than breaching into a room of tangos and blowing the crap out of them.  Right now, I'm playing R63 and working on an old AMD K6 300 MHz system. I'm hoping to get it running as a Battlefield 1942 server running Desert Combat. I'm having some serious problems, but I think I can get it worked out. I'll post up my IP if I can get it running.  I'm out for now, I'm going to do some work tomorrow so I'll be posting, probably.

       Just got back from Common Cents (convenience store) with good ol Hidden and Lost. I picked him up in the yellow 1972 GMC Jimmy that my dad and I just took the top off of. It's totally bad ass. I don't think that I could be happier in any other car.  &nbsp;  As far as work went, today was pretty good. I went to Chadron Dental right away, and got a whole bunch of stuff taken care of for them. I was there from 11 till 2:30, and I took an hour lunch after that. From 3:30 to 5 I just cleaned up the office mostly. It looks 10 times better now, actually presentable to customers. We're a little backed up so I probably should have been working on computers, but it was turning into a zoo up there. Plus my co-workers are slow and very very messy. I don't know how much longer I'm going to stay at that job. The stress is killing me.  &nbsp;  Looks like I've finally got my server up and running. I haven't gotten to actually running the server yet, but I'm optimistic. I'm getting all the windows updates and drivers right now. Hopefully it will be broadcasting over the net by midnight. I'll keep you posted on what's happening. Sayonara!

       Just&nbsp;a quick note:  I thought I would officially inform you that all the online music store suck. I tried 4 of them, and none of them had the music I needed.&nbsp;And on top of that, Spybot S&amp;D Resident&nbsp;killed the uninstall of Rhapsody, so I'm stuck with just deleting the files. Crap.&nbsp;I'm really too pissed off right now to make a long post, so I'll come back tomorrow afternoon.

       I went and saw Dodgeball with  urlLink Hidden and Lost  earlier tonight. It is a hilarious movie. I think the sound track was good, but I'm not sure. I was too busy laughing. I'll probably go and see it again, mostly because it's extremely funny but also because I want to take a closer listen to the sound track.  I wanted to get some footage linked together and get a promo halfway done today or tomorrow, but I've found that my tempo replacement hard drive is actually too slow to handle the data of reading both a video and a sound track. You can't tell me that's not sad. I am hoping to get my replacement hard drive back Thursday or Friday. Once that's done I will try and get a second here ASAP and then I can really get some editing done. Thursday we'll be doing a little filming again. (Or at least try to) When Thursday's over scene 1 should be pretty much history. That is, if everybody can make it. We'll have at least 3, probably 4, and maybe, just maybe 5.  I'm still working on the server. I found Windows 98, but I didn't get to installing it tonight. Hopefully a clean install will run a little better than what was on there before. That was painful. Although I guess it did take about as long to boot up as linux, linux was just showing my messages, so it didn't seem as long. I think I will just use the DOS portion when I get everything installed. That way I will have very little overhead.  I've got to work tomorrow, we've gotten pretty far behind. Although it's not like we haven't been behind since June. Well, I guess there was one day in the middle of June where we had one system in. That was nice. The two days after that though, we got nine systems. No matter how you look at it, that's pretty messed up. I'll be heading in at about 9 or 9:30 and staying until 3ish. I need some time tomorrow afternoon to prepare for having 5 people in my house. I may go back after hours though. I enjoy doing some time after hours, because then I don't have to deal with the public as much. I don't answer the phone, and walk-ins are the only people I talk to. I prefer that because I can get more work done, and do it more efficiently. Plus, there are no service calls. It seems like every time I go in during the day to get some extra work in, I get hit with a service call. Every. Time.  Well if I'm to get up at 7:30 I'll need to hit the sack. I'll be around, maybe from work, maybe tomorrow evening. If I'm not back...well then assume I have nothing to say.

       After a long night, and what I thought would finally get everything going, it all failed today. It still didn't work over the net, and what's worse, the server doesn't even run anymore. Why? beats me. I'm going to try Windows 98 again, and if that doesn't work, I'll try to find a copy of NT. And if that doesn't work...I don't know what I will do. Probably buy a cheapo server off of eBay or something. Or maybe buy an old PII system from work cheap. That would do the job.  In other news, my dad finished up his restoration of our old pickup. I have to say, holy crap it looks good. Plus, it runs well too. I cannot believe how amazing it looks. I'll be driving either that or the Jimmy to school. I can't wait to drive it some more. The only problem that I can find is that the legroom is about half what it used to be. The new seats are a lot more forward than the old ones. I will live though, nothing major.  My obsession with Rainbow Six: 3 continues. I've been playing mostly regular survival lately, but some team survival and mission as well. I played it pretty much all day. There are just not words to describe this beautiful game. Except maybe one: scrumtrulescent.

       Well I finally worked it out, I think. The old server should be ready to go over the internet. I had to do a clean install of Red Hat 9, but I think it's going to work. If you would be so kind as to try to connect to 65.168.150.128:14567 with Battlefield 1942 and drop me a note in comments if it works, I would appreciate it. If this works, I'm going to store it out in the garage or something and just let it sit there and run. It takes about 3 minutes to load a map, but it was completely free so I'm happy with it.  Also today, I held a surprise LAN party. When I found out  urlLink Wingman  had the day off and  urlLink Mr. Nice Guy  could make it to my house, I figured there wasn't any way I  couldn't  have a LAN. We messed around for a while, and then finally got the oil-truck/technical collision scene right. After three LAN parties and I don't know how many tries, we've finally got it done. Woo.  As for tomorrow? I'm not sure what I'll be doing, but I'll probably go in to work for a little bit to help get caught up. I'll probably have lunch at the new restaurant as well. Hopefully, I'll be able to get all the bugs worked out of this server and get things going. I'm off to bed, don't stay up too late now.

       I just finished up portions of the web site I'm making for our makeshift studio, Computer Room Productions. I think it turned out alright, but you definitely need broadband to load it up at any convenient speed.  urlLink Go check it out.  This is what I've been working on in my free time for the last few days. I could have never done it without MS Frontpage.  I'm really,  really  tired, so I'm off to bed. I'll dole out more information tomorrow.

       I've had a great day. This is the first time in a long time (read: about 3 weeks) that I haven't wanted to just quit my job on the spot. I don't know what to do now, though. I still feel like I should quit, because I'm so desperately poor, yet I still have some hopes for saving my job. It's a supreme paradox. I think I'll turn in my app to Safeway, but I won't tell my boss or god damn Gabe. That way if I get picked at Safeway, I can either turn down the offer, or take it if my job gets worse.  This post is just a short break from the most fun game I have played in a long time. I'm talking about Quake 3 Arena. The action is fast, the weapons are good, and it's just so much fun. I can't stay away any longer, I've got to get back to the actions.  urlLink You should download the demo.

       Whew, it's been a long day. I recieved my replacement hard drive today, and I've been doing all that's associated with a clean load of Windows for the past.....oh I don't know.....five or six hours. And I still haven't loaded any games. I've been transferring over files from other hard drives, installing miscellaneous programs like crazy, and trying to get&nbsp;everything configured.&nbsp;On top of that,&nbsp;I had to install XP twice, thanks to Norton Ghost. It's a wonderful product, but if there was ever something that could screw you up, Ghost is the program.  Other than that, I played&nbsp;a great game of Battlefield Vietnam earlier today with my good buddy Wingman. We played on some EAUK server, it was lacking in retards and we both had smooth pings. We played across probably 4 to 5 maps, and had a total blast. I can't wait to install it and get back to playing.  Back to my job issues, I have almost finished my job app to Safeway, I just need some info from my W-4. As soon as that is done, I will try to talk to my boss about leaving. I want to just say screw it, I'm done to him, but I feel bad about leaving. Kind of like I'm cutting him off at the knees. I'm not sure, but that probably isn't how a 16-year-old secondary tech should feel. If you've got some kid doing much of the work at your computer store, maybe it's time to switch things up a bit. In any case, I can't stay there any longer. I hate my co-workers (Well one of two, anyway.), I have an enormous amount of job stress, and I can't do all the work that's being handed to me. Oh, and I dont' make very much money. At Safeway I'd be working more, but I'd also be making lots more money. Then I can actually save for college, rather than say I will.  I'll be working tomorrow, so I'll probably find the time to slack off enough and make a post. Either that or type up a rant tomorrow evening. I guess we'll just go with the flow.

       Early tomorrow morning (about 8) I'll be leaving my humble home for Cheyenne, Wyoming. We'll spend some time there for Frontier Days. We'll go to whatever happens, and a concert. The concert's by some Australian&nbsp;guy named Keith Urban. I wanted to buy some things at Circuit City, but I wasn't able to save enough money. I was able to put off the gas, but the cable bill had to be paid. Damn.  After Cheyenne, I'll be home for a day, and then we'll head off to a lake. We'll camp there for a few days, and then return home. It will be kind of boring, but I won't have to think about what's happening at work. I know when I come back we'll be screwed again, but I don't care right now. A week and a half, and I won't have to work. Oh yeah.  Ok, I'm off to pack. I'll be back in August.

       Well I got into the office, and initially I thought that we were all caught up. Empty workstation, and only a couple computers on the floor. They looked like they were shop computers too. I was pretty impressed, until I looked under all the crap stacked about and found 4 computers waiting. Same shit, different day.  I've got a couple links here, they are some excellent sites. One is from a soldier currently in Iraq, and the other is from a Vietnam vet. I don't know if I'm just weird, but I find their personal accounts riveting.  urlLink Images of My War-Ulf R. Heller   urlLink My War-Fear and Loathing In Iraq-Anonymous   Those of you that aren't blind will probably have noticed my new design template. I think it looks a good deal sharper, and I just prefer the overall look. If you have any comments,  urlLink email them to me .

       I'm back from my excellent vacation. Even though it was just a week and a half, it feels like it's been forever.  Cheyenne Frontier Days was a blast. I picked up a GBA SP at the Circuit City, and I have to say, it's extremely entertaining. I have Fire Emblem and Advance Wars 2, and I have been playing them almost every spare minute. It was great for stuff like heavy traffic and down time around my uncle's house. While we were there, the area was absolutely packed. After we saw the Thunderbirds, the traffic was so bad it took well over 30 minutes just to get across town to the Sonic. My dad and I also went to the Wyoming Air National Guard (WANG) air base to see the show they were putting on. We saw all sorts of planes there, including a  massive  C-5 transport plane and a Huey from the Vietnam era. Later that evening, we went to a night show (concert). Trick Pony and Keith Urban were playing. Trick Pony was OK, but I was wishing for my GBA for most of the show. Keither Urban, however, was astounding. His music was good, and he is a master of the guitar. At the end of the show, every single person in the stands was standing up and cheering. It was amazing.  We came home from that on the 30th, and packed for a trip to  urlLink Lake Angostura . We were there for 4 days and 3 nights. It was an excellent trip. In retrospect, it seemed much longer than it was. I had a ton of fun just camping. Our site kind of sucked: no trees, on a hill, and the beach was very rocky. It was relaxing, though, and a break from having to worry about what's going on anywhere else.  I've got to get to work tomorrow, so I'm off to bed. Before I go though, you I wanted to hook you up with this link:  urlLink My War . This guy is on the front lines of Iraq, and he's telling it as he sees it. That does it for me, but I'll be back tomorrow. Probably from work where I'm hoping we won't be swamped (still).

       I have other things to talk about, but you must know this first. The Bourne Supremacy is bad. We're talking gigantic field of ass bad. From the moment the movie started, you could tell that this was a different director. Doug Liman did the first movie, and I thought he did an excellent job. The filming was loose, but it looked good. The story was nothing like the book, but it was alright. Here, the filming is beyond loose. Many of the scenes looked like they were filmed during a god damn earthquake. The shots moved all over the place, you couldn't see what was going on, and they could have used a fat man in a black coat for most of the shots with how blurry it all was. The fight scenes were no longer clean. Imagine some blobs in a lava lamp running into each other, and you've pretty much got it.  Then the story. Oh, the story. I have not read the second book, so maybe this is how it's supposed to be. But this felt like a movie made for somebody else. Bourne is no longer this superskilled Treadstone agent. He still has the skills, but the director tried to portray him as.....I don't know, it's hard to describe. But he makes Bourne into something different that what he was. Bourne in the first movie was the best, peerless. Now he's just a broken man with some nice skills.  I went to this movie expecting to see, like the first movie, a unique action film with some drama aspects. I saw a drama that had a hint of action here and there. Like a garnish on a fancy dinner. It's a necessary formality. The best thing I can compare it to is The Matrix. The first one was great, and then they went nuts on the second one and screwed it over. I'm going to go watch the first movie again, and then pretend like there is no sequel.  As for everything else I wanted to say...we'll talk about that later.

       OK I had this big long post typed out, and then Blogger crashed or whatever and now it's gone. Suffice to say, shit. I'll redo most of it now:  First off, I'd like to welcome my good friend Flippin Pirate to The Off-White House. He's a refugee from Xanga, make him welcome if you would. I've posted our Xbox Live! GamerTags off to the right. Look us up and play a few rounds of something with us.  I've been pretty quiet recently. This is almost completely because I figure people don't want to hear me bitch about my job. The other part is I haven't been doing anything interesting lately. And, well, I'm lazy.  What I've been doing:    Playing a whole lot of the  urlLink Battlefield Pirates Mod . It's a ton of fun in the sun. I demand you download it now.  Working, which I may or may not get fired from. Isn't that a kick in the ass?  Playing Black Arrow for the magnificent Xbox. I feel marginally ripped off, but it's good fun.  Launching little Estes model rockets. Details below.   After reading a bunch of  urlLink Armadillo Aerospace 's news updates, I got the feeling to dust off my only remaining (so I thought) working rocket.   Armadillo's going for the  urlLink X-Prize  that you've heard so much about. The news probably included Burt Rutan's  urlLink Scaled Composites , but Armadillo may give them a run for their money. Plus,  urlLink John Carmack  runs the operation.  So, indulging this urge, Wingman and I headed on on Thursday and Friday evenings to launch our rockets. (1 each) Mine alternated between good and totally balls ass crazy flights. Tom's did great the first night. But on the second night, the parachute/streamer ejection charge failed and it plummeted down into some cow pens. We weren't able to recover it. May it rest in peace.  Earlier this evening, Pirate and I headed out again and launched two of mine. (I found one.) We launched this little red and black Mars lander affair and it was a perfect flight, except the parachute got a little melty and didn't open. It was alright though. The white one flew about 500 feet into the air, and came down a quarter mile away. We found it in somebody's backyard garden. When we launched the Mars lander again, the ejection charge failed. It almost hit us on the way down When we got to the wreckage, it was OK except for the fact that one leg had flown off, and another was broken, but inside the lander still. Damn, damn, damn. Two out of 3 is enough to make me swear off  urlLink Wal-Mart 's mini engines for good. I'll buy a pack of normal size tomorrow, and then I'd like to transition to  urlLink eHobbies  for all my rocketry needs.  Just before I began typing the ill-fated blog post, I finished a dual chute system for the white rocket. I tested it outside by spinning around and pulling the nose cone off, and it works well. Hopefully we can field test it tomorrow.  I'll post the pics we took tonight tomorrow, because Pirate can't upload his pictures to his computer.  TopGun out.

       Im Flippin Pirate. One of Top Guns friends. I shall be posting here now since i found that Xanga sucked balls once you didnt pay for it. I shall be doing reviews of my games and other stuff when im bored so you all can see how crappy, or, every now and then how great a game actually is. I shall also be the picture guy and i will probably be the one posting most of the pics until Top Gun gets his Digital Camera. Now im off to get a bowl of Pops. Gotta have my Pops.
