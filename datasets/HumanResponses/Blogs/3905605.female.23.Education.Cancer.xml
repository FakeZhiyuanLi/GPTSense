      Soo Ang and Addie came up to Waterloo today to visit me for my long awaited bday celebrations.  In matter of moments, Mario party was started and some fruity drinks were made.  For dinner we went to the awesome Lotus Tea House and then came back to play some more Mario Party.. but now was turned into a drinking game! yeah for us. In the hopes to get some exciting Waterloo nightlife, we attempt to go to Elements, however, the loveable Ange-yaaaa forgets her ID! heheh, NONETHELESS, we eventually make there, dance it up with the sketchy locals, dance in the 'cage' and come back and play some more mario party.  Cheers to Mario Party!  Highlights of the night: Byron in the cage (i have a video of that!), mario party, all the fake meat and Ang & Addie turning red and falling all over the place :D  hehehe  For all the pics from this day click on the following link:   urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=mo8ocl9.1v093or5&x=0&amp;y=xurspz

      So after many emails bashing Steve and trying to organize getting him a gift the bookstore team got together at the Turret last night to present the beer stein (or whatever, the mug thingy), titled "Captain Reid, Retard Champs 2004".  Our drunken captain gracefully accepted the present and the free beer people poured into it.. as he got drunker and found out the Bookstore won the prestigous award "Best Dressed Team" for not wearing our uniforms (well I did), he preceeded to go topless and wave his shirt in the air, very much like he was in some audition for chip n' dales... sketchy, but in Bookstore style.  I guess we owe this all to Gubbels for inspiring the team. Even the little brown girl from the Quick Sandwiches team had to say "although the bookstore team are asses, I must say, they guys are the hottest...." (um....?).. and then continues to say, "Whenever we played, I would always just wish to get on first base, so I can be next to that guy..." she also hit on Chicken Wing and Steve-O.... so my conclusion is that she's on crack.  Cheers to beers.  For pictures see the following link.. you may have to set up a log in, but really that doesn't take too long to do, so just do it!   urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=mo8ocl9.cqej0r1l&x=0&amp;y=-fkkkhj   There is also an AWESOME video of pete and beck sandwiching steve... you guys have to see this.. haah. if people are interested, either comment on the blog or email me.  I must say I enjoyed the cowboy hats... etc etc. Marty, you kick ass. I love that hat. I want one.. I can be a COWGIRL!! yeah...  Sooo, hope to see you all tonight at Front Row.. if you haven't chipped in for the beer stein, please do, $5, cool!

      Guest appearance today on the blog is brought to you by byron linky pascoe jr. This is a start of a new series on ami's blog where guest appearances come onto the blog for some variety. Think of it as a guest host on some sort of ami&nbsp;TV show. If you would like to guest host on ami's blog, please send a cover letter and resume to The Link mailbox on the third floor of the peter's building. Anyway tonight was a big nite in the world of advertising. A group, a team, a family, of 6 soldiering souls came together to bring the future to the canadian clay and glass gallery, aka CCGG (or as neetu calls it canadian gay and gas gallery or CCG or C-squared-doubleG). While i was in this group, i went on sabbatical for&nbsp;a week and somehow when i returned the project was completely different; however i did recognize the formatting.   Long story short, with a recipe of a wedding story, international women's day and a freakin kick ass awareness / results chart, and with your oven on 350 for 20 minutes, plus five minutes for questions, the result is a winning way to ensure, that the one of a kind CCGG, will be simply the best. Annika is available; she is 40+ and enjoys long walks on the beach. Call 1 900 cccgg yay. Or just call alleem; he is waiting for your call. please. come on. its the end of school; just do it.   OK folks that's all for my guest appearance on the ami shah show, it's been a pleasure. I'd like to thank my publicist, my manager, my lawyer and the support of Buddy Holly. As well i would like to make it known that on the link web site (as im sure many of you check out the site daily for updates) in the bio section for management, i wrote "searching for the meaning of life" before ami. she copied me! someone, please, come on people. anyway no one is actually going to read far enough down to this sentence, so why even write you ask? i dunno. anyway, "like", check out  urlLink www.letitoutent.com  for my blog, which i need to update. Anyway, ok, good nite seattle. its been a pleasure. that's it. go home. stop reading. ami, stop pulling the ocomgorgjh.

      Soo, since the last posting, its been pretty busy!! I turned 23 last Friday and had a great day, I got surprised at 12am by some great friends.. had breakfast made for me (thanks colleen & sara!!), was given balloons, had dinner with my family&nbsp;and had an awesome roadtrip up to Ottawa!   Rafting weekend was awesome, as it was very chill, did a bunch of swimming (me and reesh!!! yeah!! yeah for jumps off the dock!), did some kayaking, and some drinking :)&nbsp; There was some great "stu" action.. but I'll leave it at that, hehe. Rafting on Sunday was kick ass as Shilps, Reesh and I took the challenge to face the Ottawa river.. often face on!! Soo classic were the expressions on Shilps face when encountering the first two rapids!!! Reesh fell out of the first rapid, but was a trooper and got right back in, ready for the next one! The ride back was more fun times too.. lots of videos to show for it!!! hehehe   Thanks&nbsp;to&nbsp;Amar,&nbsp;Reesh, Sara and Shilps for&nbsp;joining in the good times and making&nbsp;both my birthday&nbsp;and our weekend soo memorable!!&nbsp;&nbsp;   For pictures;   urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=mo8ocl9.20rlzy5l&x=1&amp;y=-gb2gt6  &nbsp;

      Sooo, again, I must say Louies' is sketchy, no matter what Dobby says, it's sketch, but because it was Shalina's birthday, it was cool for a moment (just because of her!!).. well not really all that cool, as its was freakin hot in there!! Like, they seriously need AC or even just a fan, that would be nice! They kept trying to make it seem like it was part of the atmosphere, 'we're getting hot in her!!'... riiiight!!   Dobby you're wrong.. i just don't know about louies and their 17 years old locals who think they're black, "but really their just Portuguese" - Colleen.   Soo, all I have to SHREK - HOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY. You made up for your stupid request of getting me to drive you for a CD with the baskin robbins for sure. I think the high light of today was when I saw you're twin, Shrek the movie star in the Baskin Robin's store!! It was pretty exciting!!  All Dobby has to say is "I love how Ogre means Troll" Wow Shrek, you're a troll!  That's all for now.. if anyone wants some bus tickets for rafting, i have lots!!!!!!  g'nite

      So last night after night class, Sara and I decided to bond with the girls from 189 Lester. Neetu and I bonded over a big chart and while Sara (aka Dobby) ambushed Amar in a tickle fight. However, in the midst of the night, the bonding session was invaded by Shrek, aka Nits, this interesting ogre species, who was a tad intoxicated.  In an attempt to make some non-ogre friends, Shrek unsuccessful tried to convince us to attend a social night out at Philtys. Poor Shek… its hard being an ogre, but one day you’ll find you’re ‘donkey’.  (hahah, you have to see the movie Nits!!)   All I have to say on this is… HOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY!  Oooh, soooooo for my birthday, I’m soooo excited cuz this Friday I’m going RAFTING with 4 of my good friends – SHILPS, SARA, REESHMA, AND AMAR (aka Smamar!!)  Its going to be an interesting weekend, a bunch of loony girls and alcohol….equals good times!!!!!

      Hey guys, I know a bunch of us are looking for jobs, and for myself and anyone else interested, I'm inculding articles of interest with points on interviews and getting into the industry.  ________________________  Here are some fix-it ideas for the most common image problems:   Makeover Tip #1: Take control of your mane. For women, stylish hair is likely to be one of the first things people notice about you. A striking hair cut that compliments the shape of your face combined with a color that compliments your skin tone and eye color is essential. The same is true for men. A spokeswoman for Frank Gironda Salon and Spas in Chicago's western suburbs notes "We have clients, men and women, who come to us looking for a more professional style. A lot of people have been wearing their hair the same way for years. An updated style, a color treatment or highlights to cover or soften new grey, gives them the fresh and polished look they're seeking."    Makeover Tip #2: Add color to your voice.  Renee Grant-Williams is a professional voice coach and author of Voice Power, Using your Voice to Captivate, Persuade and Command Attention. Her clientele includes top stars like the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill, Christina Aguilera and Tim McGraw. But she also works with attorneys, public speakers and politicians to improve their vocal skills. "One of my clients was a mid-level executive who had been out of work for 17 months. He had great qualifications, but in interview feedback he was told he lacked presence and seemed timid." She's helping him put more color and drama into his voice by using variations in pitch, speed and stronger consonants. "Consonants are very arresting and when elongated at the beginning of key words can add color and great emphasis to you what you have to say."   Makeover Tip #3: Clothes make the man . . . and woman.  Grant-Williams' same "timid" client walked into her office the first day with light brown hair, pale green eyes, khaki pants and a beige shirt. "Everything about him seemed quiet and somewhat bland. We've suggested he change his clothing to darker, more dramatic colors to increase his physical presence." Joyce Heiss, a human resources consultant for Sikich HR Solutions based in Aurora, Ill. adds, "A professional and well-tailored wardrobe makes a huge difference when making a first impression. Updating your wardrobe can help mask all of the other areas where you may be deficient."    Makeover Tip #4: Polish your presentation skills.  "Presentation skills are essential for anyone," notes John Connellan, Founder and President of The Executive Technique in Chicago, which helps managers and top-level executives improve their presentation and communication skills. "Whether you're asking for a loan at the bank or addressing your colleagues in a staff meeting, you must be yourself and let your personal style shine through. People want to see the real you, not an actor." The Executive Technique provides customized solutions to improve communication style and delivery. For more information see their website at www.executivetechnique.com.   Makeover Tip #5: Words - Use ‘em but don't abuse ‘em.  An often-overlooked area of speech that can be quite annoying to listeners is the overuse of words and phrases such as "like" or "you know." Even the best communicators can fall into the bad habit of wearing out these words, especially if they have school-aged children at home. In addition to sounding immature, overused words and phrases are wasted words that take the focus off what you are really trying to say. To purge these throw-away words from your speech, keep a stroke count each time you say the word, in a matter of days you'll have kicked the habit.    Makeover Tip #6: Improve your people management skills.  The ability to manage people is an essential skill in today's work world. Lea, an inside sales manager on the East Coast, recently participated in her company's feedback program for supervisors and managers. She says, "The feedback I received from my employees, co-workers and my supervisor on my skills and abilities related to people management really helped me identify areas in which I excel -- and where I need improvement." Working with the program leader, she's learning how to identify and relate to different types of personalities in a way that is motivating and inspiring. Lea and other managers at her company are now reading the book, Type Talk at Work -- How the 16 Personality Types Determine Your Success on the Job by Janet M. Thuesen.

      Today I went to my buddy Angie's Church "20 something" event.. called "Beachfest", which was fun! Our team actually ended up winning and we got PRIZES.  There were ten different church groups coming together, put on 6 different teams. The teams competed on activities such as beach volleyball, tug of war, building sand castles (of events, objects, people from the Bible), capture the flag and building bridges to hold an infinite number of bottles of water. Our team was a lot of fun, as we had tons of spirit!  Overall, really interesting, to hear the discussion, see Angie's work come together and enjoy some time with my friends.  Highlights of the day: "THE BRIDGE" that held up 10 bottles of water and a banana.. that was put together in like 2 minutes!! Our prizes - these cool spinhead people that make noises with their heads!!!!  For Pics:  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=mo8ocl9.8bwvz64x&x=0&amp;y=b81pss

      Soooo to celebrate Sara's birthday we all went out for dinner first.. oooh wait, I mean Sara and I went out for dinner.. tee hee.. well i guess my organization skills aren't the best, but nonetheless, we had an apitizer pizza and got some sketchy chinese food and were all good. As usually.. a late start made a late entry to the club, but we got in anways. We decided on Seven nightclub, however, we realize now that its not 'the' place no more.. ah well, Neetu is on the search for the new ultimate club.  Highlights of the night were: Reesh getting kicked out of the club cuz she cussed out the bouncer... "being an asshole".... "too fat to get a girl... " etc..., ambushing Aleem with pics and the free fruit on the top floor.. :D  Check out the link for pics from this night click on the title or the below link:  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=mo8ocl9.bfrr1gy9&x=0&amp;y=9640n1

      Sooo, Liz came back finally from China after a month long visit to work on a project there. Excited of her arrival, we decided to go visit her in Guelph.. however....... when we got there, I guess there was some mis-communication and Liz was in Mississauga and us three were now in Guelph! So acqua addie comes to resuce and we make 'bouncy balls'.. you can see the process through the pics!!  2 hours later, Liz, family & boyfriend all arrive and we decide that wearing wigs would be fun.. heheh, so you can see fun pics of this too!!  Finally, the climax of the night was getting our gifts (I got a cool hot pink zippy) and seeing Bri's gift, the PIG LIGHTER!! ooh my... you must see this thing.. soo cool!!  Cheers to pig lighters.

      So after chatting with Andrea Lee, I was convinced to come out to McGinnis.. so of course there are some pictures, which u can find at this link:  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=mo8ocl9.6z0ztu8h&x=0&amp;y=dz253q    Nonetheless, after waiting in line for the patio, we got cold and decided to leave! High light of the evening was going to Mels and having some breakfast!! Umm.. I love it there!!

      Sooo, in our attempt to go to the Daggerwing Fun day, Ryan "sexy mamma jamma" Burgio's car decided to start making some noises.... and then proceeds to have a flat tire!! So we pull over and check out the tire and Ryan relaizes that his spare is also flat.. yeah for Ryan.. nonetheless, Ryan decides to stand at the side of the road and in moments gets some attention and some old dudes pull up and start checking him out and offer some 'help'... Ryan then jumps into their car and speeds off, never to be seen again...  okay, so that part didn't happen.. but we did call for help and eventually made it home..  Moral of the story, Ryan is a sexy mamma jamma

       GUEST HOST: SARA    So the crew met on Tuesday night to discuss our grad trip…yeah, we tend to leave things to the last minute, but what else is new ;) Neetu, Aly, Aleem, Ami and I all gathered in Amar’s room although she wasn’t there and we tried to narrow down our choices.  Our list started off with; Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba.  So we eventually narrowed it down to Mexico, Panama, and Cuba with the help of two little kids that came by looking for people to play with…Andrea, and Gabe.  Why these countries you may be asking yourself, well we have no other choices, there aren’t any other all inclusive packages available…its late in the season.  The good thing is that this makes our decision much easier; god only knows how hard it is for all of us to decide on something!!!!  The whole night various attendees were gutting my beautiful language, particularly Andrea who couldn’t understand why we kept laughing every time she said “POON-ta cana”  Props to Aleem for facilitating the decision process by adding, “I heard that place is beautiful” EVERY time we mentioned a different destination.  He also made some great suggestions, my favorite…. lets all rent SKI-doos and drive them all the way to Mexico.  Good job Aleem!!!! heehee no worries you still hold a special place in my heart :D  Special thanks to Amar (who eventually showed up) for distracting us from our stressful decision making, with all her shopping treasures!!  I’m really excited about this trip, this is going to be the first time in a long, long time that I’m not the odd one in the group…. no Indian music, or Indian food…. it’s about time I go back to my roots!!!! teedeehee

      So after many hours of trying to get out of the house, we finally made it to Nim's house and then to Lakeshore to finally hang out. In attempts to play 'baseball', we end up losing the baseball and instead take many pictures!! After passing a football, seeing this super cool old car and getting some really really yummy DAIRY CREAM, we visited Margi and Rut and had some dinner. Later that night we picked up Reesh's hair straightener and straightened Nim's Hair.. soooooo JOKES!!! Highlights of the day: V and the snapping turtle, Dairy Cream and Nim's ooh so cool straight hair!! those pics are awesome!!!!! Sorry but they're not open to the public!! tee hee  Good luck Margi and HAVE FUN IN ARGENTINA &amp; BRAZIL!!!! I'm soooo jealous!!!! heheh
