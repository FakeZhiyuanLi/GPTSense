      watched sex and the city the other night...the episode in atlantic city... the storyline of samantha and richard... the scene where samantha ran up 11 flights of stairs to go to richard... when she said " im getting too old for this... i love you but i love myself more...".... anyway, it really got me thinking... about the "relationship" im in now.... if you can call it a "relationship".... it's been going on for almost three and a half years now... and  it's still in the " i dont know what it is or what we are" stage...im pretty tired... of analyzing, of worrying, and of guessing....it hasnt been all bad though...i have never been happier than i was when with him... he makes me laugh... even when im scared out of my wits, even when im so pissed i could cry...somehow he finds a way to make me break into a smile... he helps me get what i want... whether it be a palm pilot or a nokia 6600...he supports me all the time...he manages to always ignite passion in me... by a mere touch or look... we can have a serious conversaton one minute and a totally crazy one the next... in short, he stimulates me mind, body and soul... but is that enough?.... i keep wishing that he realize i mean something to him...why do i think he doesnt?... because somehow, he doesnt include me in his plans...or in his life... not the way i include him in mine...so again im thinking... can i be just like samantha?... can i now say..." im getting too old for this. i love you... but i love myself more"....?
