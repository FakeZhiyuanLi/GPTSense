        So last night I stayed at Megs with Kelly. Well after I got off work, we went to Applebees' and got a bite to eat. We went back to megs and its was probably around 10:30 when we got home. Well we werent tired or anything, so we went outside and hit golfballs into the lake. After that we played straight eye for the quer guy or something like that. But all me and Kelly knew was that as soon as I told megan what to do, she took off running and had no clue why me and smelly where laughing at her. So it was a fun night outside at megs. Well after a lil of that stuff we went back up to the deck and sat there for about 20 min or so. When we&nbsp; finally decided to go into the house, we realized we were locked!...Oh my god! haha, what were we going to do now. Its like 12 in the morning, and were locked out of the house. So we pondered for a lil bit and we decided to go into the garage to see if megs basement key was there. But no, it wasnt. So we sat there for a lil bit, and then decided to go ask Josh if he could get Donnys keys for us so we could get into the house. So he did, cuz hes a nice kind of guy like that..haha..and meg and kelly sat there and talked to him for a lil bit, while dumbass ashleigh sat outside in the driveway by herself. Oh my god. haha..so meg unlocks the door for us, and we get inside. She returns the keys completing a mission! haha..After about 10 min, she finally came back into the house. And Kelly you know what I mean when i say "7-20-2004, Ashleigh leaves letter, 12:20 a.m."&nbsp; OOOO I love it.&nbsp; haha, Well after meg came back into the house, we decided to go up to megs room and try and go to sleep.&nbsp; Well ashleigh, couldnt sleep, so after a while of pissin megan off, and then gettin kelly mad and going downstairs i pushed meg out of the bed, an ka-boom, she fell. Funniest things you would have seen that night. So me and meg decided to go look for smelly, so we went downstairs and played like 3 hours or so of mario cart. Awsome game. We tried to stay awake to see Gator leave :(&nbsp; but we didnt. Smelly fell asleep and then me and meg finally fell asleep around 5ish or so. But all in all, it was a CRAZY night. And we all know why! haha..But Big money megan is my hero, who completes missions, and is the best!...Oh my god!..haha..kelly you love it! O gezz, all in all, I have the two best freinds ever! I love you guys!
