      I've been thinking about Evan alot recently.  And it is always the same two memories.  The first one was when we were hanging out with his sisters and I said something silly or I didn't understand an inside joke, something along those lines, and he was messing up my hair, like you would a little kids hair, saying, "Its okay ryan, its okay." In this voice that he would use to play with me.  And everyone was laughing and forgot for a few minutes that he was leaving soon.  The second one is my favorite.  The last three days before he left I stayed at his house with his family, and we hadn't left each others side since I quit my job.  It was his last night and we, his family and me, where supposed to have a last dinner together.  Being Evan he had waited to pack until the night before his 5 am flight, so dinner kept being pushed back.  I had gone home to shower and clean up for supper and when I got back to his house he was in the middle of unpacking everything because his mother had packed it the first time and not everything fit into his one bag.  But he was determined to make it all fit. He was frustrated with his mom and concentrating on the best way to go about cramming two years worth of supplies into one backpack.  His hair had grown long and I pulled it back into a ponytail for him.  He had banned his family from the room, telling them to get ready for dinner.  I was sitting in a chair across the room from him.  He had his arms on his hips and was frowning, looking down at the floor, which was completely covered with clothes and food and batteries.  And then he looked up at me and he broke into this huge grin. And it is just that one moment, the change in his face when he saw me watching him, that I keep playing over in my mind.  He was so happy, and perfect for me in that one moment.  I wonder if that person still exists.  or if time, distance, and Africa has made him hard and bitter.  I can't imagine him as being bitter, just saddened by all the death he is witnessing.  I just want him to be happy. and to miss me.

      I've had two nightmares/dreams about N. in the past few days.  I think it is just becasue I have been listening to "stay." In the first one, he got married and continued to refer to our talk at LL when ever he saw me.  In the second one, we were all at ACL, K, S, N, E, the girlfriend, and the other two guys.  N and the g were fighting and the new bass guitarist came up to me and told me to give him some space to work it out.  But that it was all for me.  Strange.  It is odd that we can go a year without a real conversation, and then that night he thinks he can come up to me and tell me those things.  I always thought it was there because of the smile, but he has been so involved with someone else that it is just strange.  I was so angry with him for so long and maybe I still am a little frustrated.  How do you react when someone tells you, you were his best kiss ever, that he thinks about you all the time, that your so responsible and he has never had that before?  What do you do when he says this with his fiance in the room, and he hasn't had anything to drink?  I was in shock, the only thing I managed to spit out was "aren't you engaged?"  I guess the reason I've been thinking about it is because so many people I know are getting married.  I would kill any guy that was engaged to a friend and was saying those things to some other girl, especially a girl he doesn't know that well.  I wonder if they will really go though with the wedding.  And I'm mad at myself for being flattered when he told me.  I don't want to be on a pedestal.  Even though that is the only it works between us.

      so writing here is going to be replacing all the letters I have been writing. No more letters to China or Africa.    I have been in a really good mood for the past few days, and nothing out of the ordinary has happened.  It is great to have those kinds of days, when it is nice outside and you just want to drive around and listen to music with the windows down.  It is like the feeling you would get in high school on Friday afternoons.  Nothing good has happened yet, but your positive it will.  I went shopping for my new apartment yesterday.  There is a huge 4' by 6' mirror I have wanted to get forever that I was finally able to buy. and some other small things like a desk lamp and some shelves.  Although I didn't get much, I feel like what I did get will tie everything together and I am excited to move into my new place with all the windows.  Filled out loan applications all night.  that bites.  I've never had to do anything like that before and it kinda made me nervous.  I was always so impressed with the fact that Evan always seemed understand everything having to do with financial matters.  I feel like I know nothing and dread my second year tax course.  When I was furniture shopping I came across these little black frames with fortunes inside.  I am making some similar ones for friends, but instead of fortunes I will be putting quotes inside that remind me of them or have something to do with their situation.  I am excited about them and spent a while picking out quotes for people tonight.  I'm reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.  I picked it up at B&N after I read the first page.  It is really good.    Still no word from Guinea.  But I'm guessing I will hear something soon, if not from Evy then from Linda.  It has been almost a month and that is the longest I've gone without one of them getting in touch with me.

      so its almost one and I can't sleep.  I just finished this really...I would say 'upsetting' book, but I don't think that is the right word... I guess it is thought provoking.  A book meant to enrage the reader into action, into doing something.  A book where the author clearly wants the reader to experience the disbelief, the shock of the experience.  An experience one can only assume the author went through.  It was about a girl who is a creative writing major who pursues, seduces, and sleeps with her prof.  And then switches it around to make it appear that she was the wronged one.  That he traded sex with her for an introduction to his publisher.  I'm still undecided on whether or not I liked it.  I rewrote the above paragraph in three different places.  My concern was that you wouldn't be interested in reading about some book I read.  It all seems so silly compared to what you're doing.  And here I am agonizing over what you will and won't want to read when you get back.  If you do come back and if you do decide to read this.  So the e-mail you sent me, this is the one time I will address it on here.  But you probably need some of the back story on how I was handling your absence before any of this will make sense. I was doing okay. yes, i missed you and yes, I thought about you often. but I had gotten to the point where I was not freaking out when there was no word for a month.  the time interval between our contact was growing and I was growing accustomed to it.  the bad thing about it was that when I did get upset, (which I only did once during April/May, and I am proud that I was able to go two months) that was when I wrote to you or your mom.  I feel like your mom totally thought that I was falling apart. which I wasn't.  And I don't know how to be more clear on that, I was doing good.  I knew that things weren't going to be the same, but I still had hope.  So then I get this e-mail from you that is totally removed.  You rushed over the topic, rather harshly, as if it were on the same level as the pointless chit chat that preceded it in the e-mail. That was what hurt the most.  Not the idea of us being over, but the way you said it.  In truth I had been distancing myself from you since you left.  Jamey didn't even know your name, neither does wayne. they know you as my boy in Africa.  I talk about you all the time, but I always say "my boy in Africa."  And recently when talking to guys that I would have normally dated, when asked about you and i, I was honest and upfront. I told them I didn't know what was going to happen, that at one point I was convinced I would marry you.  And in talking about you to new people I realized a lot of things...  that a huge part of why I loved you was because you never made me guess. I never questioned anything, our relationship or your love for me.  there was no grace period when I would wonder when you were going to call because we were never not together after that Tuesday.  I could tell just by looking at you that you loved me.  And I had never experienced that before.  And I guess that is why it is so hard for me to believe you are able to completely drop that. I know you loved me.  If you didn't I fell like my world would come crashing down.  If I imagined that how will i ever know when real love comes along?  okay so this has turned into a long rambling, whining letter. enough. But I want you to know one thing, I cried more when you left in Jan. then when you sent that e-mail. That should show you just how much I had been distancing myself from you.  I started this "journal" as a way to communicate to you.  This will be the only post like this. hopefully. they will be more thought out and cohesive in the future.

      okay so, after you left I tried for a long time to come up with something I could give you when you got back.  At first I thought I would make a black book just for you, and keep track of everything that way.  But just by looking at that you wouldn't know what was really going on, because those are so vague I would have to be there to explain everything.  Not only that, but they are so personal who knows if I would be able to part with it when the time came.  so then I was going to keep a book and just write all my letters to you in that.  But after talking to a friend, I decided to do this because I will be more likely to write everything and more often than I would otherwise.  I've grown up writing on the computer and this is just easiest.  I hope you don't think it seems more impersonal.  So, this is whats been going on with me... The week before I left Austin, I got my tattoo. Vade Mecum in white on the inside of my left wrist.  Now that it is healed you would barely notice it.  I walk around all the time without my watch on and my parents still haven't noticed it. I really like it. Maybe in a few years after I have been out of law school for a while I will go over it in a color.  you never know-  I am going to the Simon and Garfunkel concert with Jamey next week.  He is the guy I wrote to you about, the guy from work in Austin.  We hang out every once-in-a-while.  He went through a messy breakup and we have bonded over similar situations.  Had we met at another place another time he would have been the type of guy I would be interested in.  But I'm glad I got to know him when I did because he has become another good friend.  Almost another Krysten for me.  So I'm tired and going to bed now... I had intended to write more about that e-mail you sent, but maybe I will later, i think I'm kinda over it now.  I just don't believe that you don't have feelings for me.

      In one week, two different boys have explained to me how boys in-general think.&nbsp; Its all about spatial and sequential one told me.&nbsp; Boys go 1, 2, 3 and girls do it all a little at a time.&nbsp; In packing for Houston I've definitely proven this theory true.&nbsp; I get started on four different things, that I'm convinced have to be done at the same time, get confused on what is going where, get frustrated and annoyed because I don't know where to start or what to do next, and attempt to do four other things.&nbsp; It has definitely made packing take longer than it should.&nbsp;   Wayne can back me up on the fact that it takes me a while to move.&nbsp; About three years ago he got really annoyed with my packing technique.&nbsp; I not only frustrated myself, but everyone around me.&nbsp; He was so mad at me that day...    My dad turned 45 today.&nbsp; I feel really lucky that my parents are so young.&nbsp; But parents are another post...   4 days until Houston  song of the day:  Daniel remade by Fuel

      I had&nbsp;a really productive day.&nbsp; Everything is set up for the apartment, my account is switched to the new address, I've done everything I had to do before I left.   I know I've lead a sheltered life.&nbsp; But I just don't understand how some people could be so mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like it would be hard to live with yourself if you did certain things.&nbsp; Always wondering in your head, if sooner or later, your actions would catch up to you.&nbsp; Sometimes you just have to walk away.&nbsp; Easier said, than done.   &nbsp;  And things could always be worse...

      I always get annoyed when people push me about my writing.&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp; even if they are only encouraging, it irritates me.&nbsp;&nbsp; When someone tells me&nbsp;that I don't write enough, I always come away from the conversation a little angry with that person.&nbsp; I guess angry because who are they to involve themselves in something so private&nbsp;as my writing.   I have such a hard time sharing anything I write.&nbsp; This is like a little exercise for me, getting me to open up and let people read this.&nbsp; It only took me a month and a half to make it a public domain.&nbsp; But I guess this is easier because, for the most part I don't know my audience.&nbsp; I have only given the address to three people.&nbsp; And there are no expectations with this writing.&nbsp; This isn't something I re-worked, or rewritten.&nbsp; Its just scribbling every thing out that is in my head.   I've shared my real writing with so few people.&nbsp; And it always makes me so nervous to hand over one of my poems.&nbsp; I know what goes into each one, the stress or pain.&nbsp; Regardless of whether or not the person can relate to the poem, it will never mean as much to them as it does to me.&nbsp; Are all writers like this with all their work?&nbsp; Or is it just becasue poetry is so personal?&nbsp;&nbsp;   It isn't that I'm not proud of my writing, because I am.&nbsp; I just may be too proud, too scared to have someone not like it.&nbsp; I'm forever rewriting a poem.&nbsp; Nothing is ever finished or good enough.&nbsp; And&nbsp;the reason I end up sharing them sometimes is to see if I truly captured the feeling I was aiming for, or if I'm the only one who can see it because I experienced it.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  I'm going to send a letter tomorrow.

      It was a rough day today.&nbsp; I think because I was hoping to get an e-mail from Africa or a phone call giving me a time to call.&nbsp; No such luck.&nbsp; But I know he talked to his family today, so&nbsp;in a few days I will probably hear something from his mom.&nbsp; I jumped everytime my phone rang.&nbsp; sad.   I&nbsp;haven't had more than 3 hrs of sleep for 6 out of the past 7 nights.&nbsp; I don't know what my deal is.&nbsp; I'm just so excited about the upcoming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's nice to have something to look forward to.&nbsp;

      Tonight I got to remember alot of things I had allowed myself to forget about my past.&nbsp; its funny how you can have an impact on someone's life, and you both remember the exact instant.&nbsp; But you remember it in very different ways.&nbsp; I'm surprised that he remembers I was wearing yellow after 11 years.&nbsp; I think I was too arrogant when I was younger, maybe I was just too naive and I didn't know that you were supposed to hide confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think I probably hurt more people than I realize when I was younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;   We talked about when I first became obsessed with music.&nbsp; It was definitely listening to Weezer's Pinkerton in the back of a Bronco, way after curfew when I was 16, with two people who I knew cared about me and who knew my ups and downs.   So here's to James- "Laid"&nbsp; for all the memories and to keeping in touch.   Shaun was right, Damien Rice "Cannonball" is my new favorite.

      I just went to see King Arthur with my youngest brother and&nbsp;the 19 yr old that has a crush on me.&nbsp; It was pretty good, better than I expected at least.&nbsp; I like the different twist on the story.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Started packing today for Houston.&nbsp; Can't wait.  &nbsp;  News from Evan's mom... they sent the PCVs back to their posts.&nbsp; things have started to calm down.&nbsp; A miner in Southern Guinea found a 128 caret diamond&nbsp;and the govt. thinks this will solve all their money issues.&nbsp; Strange the way things work out.

       Yeah, so I must miss playing soccer more than I thought because I dreamt I was playing last night.&nbsp; I toss and turn alot in my sleep.&nbsp; In my dream I was doing a thrown-in, and I must have been making the actual movement with my hands because I slammed my arm into the bookcase beside my bed.&nbsp; I now have&nbsp;a killer bruise and it hurts to flex my hand.  &nbsp;  I know all my posts have been about running into people I haven't seen but i had something different happen tonight.&nbsp; This girl came in who I wasn't really friends with in school.&nbsp; But being a small town we grew up together, knew each all our lives, had all the same classes, yada yada yada.&nbsp; Anyway, in school she was really kind of annoying and got my nerves, a very self-involved person.&nbsp; But tonight it was amazing.&nbsp; She was unbelievably nice and sincere.&nbsp; And it was just good to talk to her.&nbsp; Which is something I never thought I would say about her.&nbsp; I guess that is just part of growing up and coming into your own.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Or I could just be starved for conversation in this hell-hole of a town. Two weeks left.

       So it is 4 am and I can't sleep again.&nbsp; I don't know what the deal is, I think it is stress over starting law school/money/my new apartment.&nbsp; Even with all that is going on in Africa, I haven't really been to concerned.&nbsp; Evan can take care of himself, far better than I can take care of myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There is this kid, JL, who I have known for about 15 years.&nbsp; When we were younger both of our families were in summer musicals. &nbsp;I was always left babysitting because I am the oldest, JL is 5 yrs younger than me, one yr younger than my little sister.&nbsp; So he has been bugging me to go see a movie with him.&nbsp; And in the past we all would have gone together, me, Dax, Ty, and him.&nbsp; No big deal.&nbsp; But now with just the two of us it seems weird and I can't bring myself to go.&nbsp; Add in the fact that I found out he has a crush on me and I can't do it.&nbsp; Even though he keeps saying I should just look at him as my stand-in brother until Dax is back.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So that got me started thinking about crushes.  And thinking about all the crushes I have had in the past.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Pretty much from&nbsp;at the same time&nbsp;I met Krysten, I met someone else who became the ultimate crush from afar.&nbsp; First, let me explain what exactly a crush from afar is... It is someone who you don't really know.&nbsp; You may know them socially, or you may not even know their name.&nbsp; But the main point is,&nbsp;you've never had a conversation with them.&nbsp; Thats whats so great about a crush from afar.&nbsp; You are able to turn the person into whatever you want them to be. You run into them out, randomly.&nbsp; You slowly learn bits and pieces from other people.&nbsp; eventually you'll probably meet, and thats where it ends.&nbsp; Because usually a crush from afar is so great until they talk, but by then you expect so much from them, that they can't live up to it, and you are left un impressed.&nbsp; unhealthy? yes.&nbsp; fun? you betcha.(until the end at least, and writing all that down makes it all seem very trivial and mean)&nbsp; Does this make any sense?&nbsp; Let me explain my first crush from afar and see if that helps.  &nbsp;  Sophomore year of college, I am dating this guy ARM.&nbsp; He is much, much older, knows everyone, and gets me into 21 and up places.&nbsp; (A pretty good guy, we are still friends, although his girlfriend isn't a fan of me.)&nbsp; One night when I met Arm at Ptar, I notice there are three girls from my high school there.&nbsp; I go over, sit down, say hi.&nbsp; A few minutes later this guy walks up, sort of introduces himself, starts talking to the other girls, I wander off.&nbsp; So the next night at Carneys, after Amy tried to make me change clothes, we met up with ARM and Amy's boy.&nbsp; Right before the bar closes, I notice this guy looking at me, turns out it is the guy from before.&nbsp; I yell out, "Hey I know you."&nbsp; Motion for him to come over and introduce him to everyone.&nbsp; Turns out he already knows everyone.&nbsp; He sits down and is just staring at me.&nbsp; Finally right before we leave, he takes my hand tells me I am the most beautiful girl he has ever seen and can we just hang out sometime.&nbsp; Amy and I start laughing, from shock mostly, I hurriedly write down my number and take off.&nbsp; Of course, he never calls.&nbsp; So began my first crush from afar.  &nbsp;  Though the grapevine we find out 1) he too is much older 2) he is friends with everyone I know 3) he isn't in school 4) he is a lead singer in a local band.&nbsp; So for about a 6 months, we, Krysten and I,&nbsp;would go to the shows, and jam out to the cover songs in the back.&nbsp; About a year after I first met him, we figured he couldn't recognize me and were enjoying the concerts front and center.&nbsp; And then two years later, we all (Me, Krysten, Jake, the crush and his bandmates) ended up sitting at a kitchen table together.&nbsp; When I actually started listening to the conversation, I was laughing at myself.&nbsp; Krys caught my eye from across the table and we both cracked up.&nbsp; Krys just kept egging them on.&nbsp; The conversation basically centered around them and how they could make raps about any ordinary thing, and how they were going to sell those jingles to become famous.&nbsp; "How do you like your chicken cooked?"&nbsp; And or the next 6 months I thought I was such an idiot for ever thinking all those things about him.&nbsp; And then somehow, three years later, we all became close friends. (And until recently he didn't have any idea who I was, or if he did, he didn't let on.&nbsp; One night I brought it up, and we all just laughed.)  &nbsp;  So that was my first crush from afar.&nbsp; And I realized all my crushes have lead to good things.&nbsp; Scotty T and I became friends.&nbsp; Evan began as a crush from afar, but somehow fit into everything I wanted.&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; Jamey began as a crush from work.&nbsp; China boy began as a crush from across the class room.&nbsp; ASheedy is the best crush ever, because I never know when he will show up, but it always turns out great.&nbsp; He is still a true crush with no real conversation.  &nbsp;  i ramble.&nbsp; alot.

      It takes a lot for a small country like Guinea to make the news over here.  But it has finally happened.  Because so many aid groups have pulled funding, the price of rice, the main staple in a Guinean diet, has skyrocketed.  But there is no rice to sell anyway.  It has been reported that there are cargo ships off the coast, but they won't unload until they are given the money promised by the govt.  Problem is there is no money because of the corrupt govt. Officials, 88 of which have been fired. Evan and I joked around before he left about how all he was going to eat was rice and mangos.  I guess he is left with just mangos now.  Many families are having one meal every two days.  You can find the article at ABC News on-line.    i have had some crazy dreams lately.  Other than that I am just getting ready to move.

      First, I have become addicted to Ebay. I'm not quite sure how it happened, but I have spent about 4 hours on ebay over the weekend.  It all started when I was looking for a vintage chair for my new apartment and has escalated from there.  I am pretty stingy about the money thing though, and only bid when it is cheap.  So I am usually outbid, and have won nothing so far.    Garage sales.  Friday morning I got up around 8 and went to probably 30 garage sales before 10:30.   They were all within about a 6 mile radius.  And you would think, that because this town is so small, I would know all the street names and have an easy time navigating the sales.  Not so.  There are so many freakin streets called Hyde Park it is unbelievable.   And they are all within a mile of each other.  There is Hp Circle, Hp Dr., Hp ST., Hp Lane, Hp Court, Hp Pkwy.  So I didn't find anything worth buying all morning and then hit the jackpot right as I was about to give up.  There is this little warehouse down the road from my house, and two old ladies use it to store all their stuff.  They were cleaning it out and had a lot of really cool old vintage sheets, Lamps, and furniture.  I got a rust colored lamp, with the Chinese looking flowers on it.  I got a set of King size sheets in this cool white with pale blue flowers, with two sheets, a fitted sheet, and three pillowcases to make curtains out of. All that for $5.50.  Not too bad.  Considering I wanted a lamp that was $78 from pottery barn.  I was going to get this really cool carved table thing for only $3, but in the end I decided it was way too big for my apartment.  First, let me say, I am a damn good waitress.  And because of this I get respect from the other waitresses and the managers.  And because of that I get away with a lot more than I should.  But, I never do anything stupid.  Tonight, the manager on duty found out I was only two years younger than him.  He is the only unmarried manager.  He was buying drinks for the whole crew to try, like three drinks at the beginning of the shift.  And then later on he came up to me, and wanted me to do an Irish Car Bomb with him in the office.  Talk about stupid.  It is one thing to say you are going to buy one drink for 12 people to split and try it so that they know what they are selling.  And entirely another to take shots with an employee under you in the office.  I wouldn't do it, so he did both shots himself.  I think he must have kept drinking, because he looked smashed when I left work.  News from Africa.  Evidently Guinea has become a very tense area, more so than before.  The Guinean franc has been devalued again, as of this weekend.  They pulled all the PC volunteers from their posts and all 30 of them are in Conakry together.  The Govt.  has told them to stay within two blocks of the embassy at all times.  Late on Friday there were riots over the price of rice, with all the govt. officials blaming each other. Gangs of youths are holding up any vehicle that might be carrying food.  And as news spreads more and more people are joining in. Police are denying the 20 odd deaths the people say happened when the police shot into the crowd.  I haven't heard from Evan, but I talked to his mom today.  There is not another girl, never was evidently.  He just doesn't want me waiting on him to come home because he doesn't know if he will come home.  As much as I say I've moved on there is still a little hope deep down that in the future everything will work out.  Maybe 10 yrs from now when we've both had a chance to do everything we want to do.

      I haven’t done anything with my day, I’m such a bum.  I am starting to feel useless.  The same feeling I had right when I decided to move to Austin on a whim.    Was thinking about Evan recently.  And it was funny, because I got news from Africa last Thursday and usually I rush to tell Jamey or Krysten.  And when I was with Jamey this week I totally forgot to tell him what I had heard.  One of the last international aid organizations has pulled funding from Guinea.  And it happens to be the group Evan was working with, the French will be gone by mid-July.  I have no idea what this means as far as his projects.  I hope he won’t have to start over completely after 6 months of effort.  But I do know that the people leaving are the people he was answering to.  I hope he speaks Malinke well enough to get by since no one speaks English and the French officials are leaving, and they are the only people who speak French. I really think it is over for good.  I don’t think there is any going back to what we had.  Part of what I loved was the innocence of it all.  Our relationship hadn’t been tainted by doubt at all, and now that is all it consists of.  And I have a hard time getting over doubt, as seen in past relationships.  I am going to Garage Sales tomorrow to look for antique lamps and curtains.  I am so excited I can’t go to sleep.  I’m such a dork! So easily excited.

      One of my favorite ways to get to know people is just to ask random questions.  The trouble is, when they ask me the questions back I never have an answer.  So on my long drive home from Austin today, I figured out all my favorites.  Beach:		Hawk’s Nest, St. John, USVI Color:		pale, pale, yellow Movie:		The English Patient Date:		Take-out and rent a movie Season:	        Fall Name:		Oliver and Alice Time of day:	1am-5am Food:		Caribs and Shark bites, Woody’s, St. John Mistake:	Mikki James Music Video:	Coldplay “Back to the Start” 		Gary Jules “Mad World”  I could read anything and everything by: 		Irving Stone, John Steinbeck  I want to look like: 		Charlize Theron  Most Prized Possession: 		My black books  I can listen to these CDs all the way through, over and over: 		Third Eye Blind – The first one 		Mojave 3 – Spoons and Rafters 		Blue October – The Answers  Best song lyrics ever:		Bright Eyes, “Bowl of Oranges” 	“The rain it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming, so I got out of it.  And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.  Just my nightstand and my dresser where my nightmares had just been.  So I dressed myself and left then, out into the grey streets.  But everything seemed different and completely new to me.  The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.  And each person I encountered I couldn’t wait to meet.  I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.  I said, “I’m terribly sorry but there is nothing I can do for you that you can’t do for yourself.”  He said, “Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand.  I think that would help.”  And so I sat with him awhile and then I asked him how he felt.  He said, “I think I’m cured. No, in fact, I’m sure of it.  Thank you, Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.”  So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.  And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.  But when crying don’t help and you can’t compose yourself, it is best to compose a poem.  An honest verse of longing or a simple song of hope.  That is why I’m singing…  Baby don’t worry cause now I got your back.   And every time you feel like crying, I’m gonna try and make you laugh.  And if I can’t, if it just hurts too bad, then we’ll wait for it to pass and I will keep you company through the days so long and black.  And we’ll just keep working on the problem we know we’ll never solve of love’s uneven remainders.  Our lives are fractions of a whole.  But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.  Then I think we would see the beauty.  Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges, like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.”  A few things I am not a fan of: Socks with sandals Oreos and Ketchup 4pm – 7pm Sundays “My bad”

      I played soccer all my life.  And in Cleburne we didn't get a girls team until my junior year, I played on boys varsity along with four other girls my freshman year.  I became close friends with a group of senior boys who were on the team, I was their little sister.  They drove me to and from school and just generally looked out for me.  After they graduated I lost touch with most of them, except for this one guy, Shaun.  He wasn't on the soccer team, but because he was close friends with the guys we got to know each other.    He was in a horrible car accident right before school started, and one day when one of the guys were driving me home we stopped by the hospital to see him.  It was the first time we meet.  But we got along really well, and he is just one of those people you can tell anything to.  So through out high school, I was a little rowdy.  And I would drink too much and then sit on the couch and talk to Shaun about everything, usually the screwed up relationships I was in.  And he always knew what I needed to hear.  I know he couldn't have been around that much because he was in college, but it seems like he was always there for me.    In college, we only spoke every few years (we both went to A&M).  Last year, right after I graduated he stopped by one day while he was in town.  I was leaving the next day for the Islands, and we could only talk for a while.  But I remember how shocked he was when we talked.  He kept saying over and over that I had grown up.  That I looked the same, but just sounded different.  It was strange.  And I hadn't seen him since then, until tonight.  He happened to come in with all the guys I used to run around with, most of them were married and with their wives.  We could only talk for a minute, but I am excited to hang out with him later this week and catch up.    My whole point is I am really bad about walking away from people.  When I graduated I only said goodbye to a handful of people.  And because I graduated early, no one knew what happened to me.  I left Krysten to answer all the questions.  And I wonder if I have lost some good friends because of my bad habits.  It was so great to see someone, who knows me so completely.  And no matter how much time passes between when I last spoke with him, he still knows me, and it was like we were together the day before.    It is said that the older you get the more you need the people who knew you when you were young and I guess it is true.  He has seen me at my worst, from a silly 14 yr old destroyed by a boyfriend, to a 21 yr old at 4am stressed out by finals.  And he still thinks the world of me and knows what advice to give me about boys.

      Isn’t it strange how sometimes you can read something, or hear a song’s lyrics, and it seems that those words were written only to describe you or your current situation.  The more I read, the more I realize, that I love the words more than I love the stories.  If that makes sense.  Read something by Milan Kundera and you might understand what I mean.  Most people love “The Unbearable Lightness of Being.”  But “The Book of Laughter and Forgetting” is my favorite.  The story is strange and rather confusing, at several points I had no idea what was going on.  But every few paragraphs he presents an idea, an idea that is simple but seems ornate because of the wording.  I know I am strange and weird and all those other things that usually keep people away. But I am sure that at some point in most everyone’s life they have read or heard something that made them feel understood, or represented, or not alone.  When I was younger I always said that my dream job was to help people find their “perfect book.”  The book that gives them that indescribable feeling.  Last summer, right after I moved to Austin, I read Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road.”  When the narrator is describing himself and his friends, I saw myself in the words.  I wrote out that page and had it on my fridge the entire time I lived in Austin.  It was one of the last things to be packed.  “But then they danced down the street like dingledoodies, and I shambled after as I’ve been doing all my life after people who interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a common place thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue center light pop and everybody goes “Awww!””  that is how I feel sometimes.  Like I am trying to keep up with everyone around me, and we are all rushing towards a beautiful but tragic ending.  I watch those around me, and I question my abilities while admiring theirs.  And in my mind other people come to be characterized by the quote I associate them with in my black books.  Krysten – “All the time-no matter what she was doing-there was music.  Sometimes she hummed to herself as she walked, and other times she listened quietly to the songs inside her.”  And Wayne – “I would like, as you see, to convince myself that my pleasure in your response is not plain vanity but the pleasure of being heard, the pleasure of companionship, which seems more honorable.”  And then there are song lyrics.  But that is another post, for another time.

      So I've made it through my first two days. I am actually really enjoying class although at times it has been a little boring so far, but that is because we were just going over the logistics of everything. I have one professor that is a 40 year old frat boy/pretty boy with long hair, which he parts on the side and is constantly pushing behind his ears. So much so that it is a distraction. He is also rather arrogant, but I think that is to be expected of most professors. I have another professor, who has been a judge on the cca for 10 years. We (the class) didn't know that at first and someone called him professor instead of judge. That will never happen again. The reading hasn't been horrible yet, but I do have 60 pgs for one class tomorrow, and the reading for the other two classes.  Some funny things our professors have told us the past few days:  The Law has been called a jealous mistress, the judge said that was incorrect, it is a nymphomaniac. It will suck the life out of you, but you will love every minute of it.  Some strange laws that still exist in Texas:  Wire cutters can not be carried in your pocket. The entire Encyclopedia Britannica is banned in Texas because it contains a formula for making beer at home. It is illegal for one to shoot a buffalo from the second story of a hotel. It is illegal to take more than three sips of beer at a time while standing.    And for Krysten: racketeering - n. The federal crime of conspiring to organize to commit crimes, particularly as a regular business ("organized crime" or "the Mafia").  I sent a package to Africa today.

      That 20% of the people who attend AA are lawyers. And did you know that it is generally assumed, that most lawyers are raging alcoholics. yeah, me neither. It makes me question my chosen profession.  So tonight, we had a happy hour set up by the 2Ls for all 1Ls. I think it was truthfully so all the guys could scope out the girls, since the only 2Ls there were boys. And then later tonight I met some girlfriends from school at the front porch pub, which is less than 2 blocks away. This man , who was at least 40 yrs. old, came up to our table three times, and since I was unlucky enough to have been there at all 3 times he focused on me. And he was with his 22 yr. old girlfriend ( he told us this, like it was big secret, she looked like his daughter). I don't know if he was trying to trade in for a younger, blonde version or what. But he definitely made me a little nervous, especially when he tried to give me a kiss on the cheek. I am certainly younger in this town.  So here's to being the right age, once again... and to $5 pitchers.

      First day of Law school today. I'm gonna be a kick ass lawyer. My professors are awesome. The school divided us into four sections: A, B, C, D. I'm in section C. My professors are the ones in charge of orientation and one of them made the opening remarks this morning. He is going to be my favorite, I can already tell. He is really old and considered an expert in four different fields of law, which is huge. He has an eye patch, was an English major, and was in the Navy. He told this long story and went into a spill about how our stock and trade were words. And his is the only class that I don't have a huge assignment for the real first day of class.  In Legal Research and Writing she gave us three cases to brief. Kind of a crash course, learn it on your own, and we will go over our mistakes in class. I started studying at 5, took a 45 min. break, and I'm still only 2/3s done at 11. But I love it, and I'm determined to have all the right answers tomorrow. Some of the other groups only had like three pages to read. Which is a bummer because they all got to go out together, but my group will be ahead of the game at the start of next week.  Supposedly I'm in the good section (according to the 2Ls I met today). He said all the good professors tend to stick together in one group and that then the students are put into sections by ability, in order to encourage closer competition. Who knows if they were telling me the truth. I like my profs, regardless.  A girl I went to Africa with, and a girl I know from A&amp;M, are both in my entering class. But not in my section, so I probably won't see them much.  So...back to studying...

      I had a heart attack today writing a check for my books. I get my financial aid check next week, but still, I've never spent so much on books at once. Supposedly books for law school will be between $800-$1000 every time.  So after that got my first assignments.  And I haven't really done anything with my day. I'm addicted to my computer, I'm on it constantly. And I keep checking my e-mail, I guess knowing he has e-mail has wrecked my week. I keep getting on and checking, hoping for something. And deep down I know it isn't there, that I just checked five minutes ago. And this makes the day seem way too long. Makes me feel more alone. Loneliness is always the worst when you're waiting on some kind of confirmation. And even though everyone has said I should just walk away- that when someone pushes and pushes and then suddenly stops, he will sit up and take notice- but not until I walk away. I just can't do it. Even though my e-mails to him are pointless and repetitive. I feel better sending them. I like to think he reads them and knows whats going on with me. Just thinking that he knows whats going on with me somehow makes it easier.  So... I've had lots of time and energy to devote to my black book. This is definitely my best one yet. And I can't help but wonder, why do I really make them? Is it some way of preserving myself? Who knows... Vade Mecum  I'm rambling, but my horoscope today was: There's a time and place for everything. Tell your story here and now. You matter.  So I'm getting it all out.  "It seems an age since I've seen you. Countdown as the weeks trickle into days. I hope that time hasn't changed you. All I really wanted was for you to stay." Powderfinger

      There ended up being 6 girls in my apartment, all trying to get ready at the same time. And heres me trying to give every other girl directions to the club from where they are parked, when I've only lived here a few days.  First let me say, going out in Houston is not even close to being the same as going out in Austin. The party we went to was at the Cotton Exchange Bar. Which is the actual historical cotton exchange building. Huge vaulted, painted ceilings, tons and tons of suits and ties. A lady waiting on you in the bathroom, who you have to tip or she gets really mean. Chandeliers, wood floors, and leather couches. And I stroll in wearing a torn up Ramones t-shirt, jeans, heels that look like converse, a sparkly green scarf and aviators. At least Krys and I were a rockstars, two of the girls dressed as groupies and you should have seen the looks they were getting. A few of the suits asked what the occasion was, other than that I just felt really young.  Just last Friday night Krys and I talked about how when we started going out in Austin, we were always the young ones. But now when we go out in Austin, we are the older girls. Not that way in Houston, I was clearly younger by at least 5 years. Maybe it was just that the other girls had on dresses and pearls. I don't see myself ever fitting into that scene.  So we all took off, and headed for the Red Door. We ended up taking a cab because we had paid $10 for parking and didn't want to have to pay to park again. Just one word of advice, choose your cab driver carefully. Ours thought Krysten was a prostitute and really freaked me out. When we got there, there were over 50 in line and it was 1:30. Krys and I decided to bail when we realized we were only a block or two from my apartment. On the way home we passed some places that are closer to my speed, complete with picnic benches and flipflops.  So it ended up being an expensive Saturday night. But I learned a lesson, and now I know where to go.   I am going to pick up my books and first assignments at the school today.  And if I want to, I could call Evan today.

      So skipped out on the wedding and ended up in Beaumont late on Friday night. I highly recommend riding 4wheelers at 3 in the morning in the middle of nowhere. But watch out for cows.  Jake's bakery rocks. We were definitely on a sugar high during the drive home this morning. made up for time lost yesterday, the hour and half drive in under an hour.  Rockstar and Groupies party tonight. We're definitely rockstars. Four girls in my tiny apartment is way too many.  Houston is more fun than I thought.

      Good times. Good times. It never fails that I have a blast while in Austin. From Krys running across the interstate to get change for the tollbooth, to seeing people I haven't seen since I graduated college. LeGrand was definitely shocked to see us. I meet a fiance and apologized to Willy. Danced front and center at Lucky and rode a pedicab, twice. Buttermilk pancakes at Kirby and Rocha's homecooking. Finally crashed around 6 in the morning. Up at 9, and a three hour drive became 4 1/2 hours.  in that 4 hours I had plenty of time to think about the crazy stuff Krys and I somehow pull off. We somehow always manage to put our selves in positions that could be potentially disastrous, not to mention life threatening. From junkies sleeping on the floor, to getting invited to different musicians places. I am pretty much willing to try anything, at least once.  Man do we have some good stories.  Now I just have to decide between a party in Houston tomorrow night, or a wedding in Dallas. I'm leaning towards the party.

      So Everything is set up and I'm all settled into my new apartment. It is tiny, but very me. One entire wall is floor to ceilings windows. It is a lot nicer than anywhere I've ever lived on my own. I have to buzz people up to my room. At most of my friend's places that were gated, the gates were always open. Here they never are, partially because I live on the edge of the third ward and everytime you leave the building there is someone asking for a handout. The homeless are a lot more forceful here than they are in Austin. There are tons of medical students and doctors living here. It is kinda weird because there are so many porshes parked around the square.  Everyone is so dressed up at all times. I look super sloppy, but I really don't care. It is super hot here compared to how it was in Cleburne. I had forgotten how hot it used to be in College Station during the summer.  There are huge trees and bushes surrounding the complex, and at the bases they are all labeled. Everytime I see those I think of Evan and his obsession with stuff like that. He even sent a leaf in a letter and labeled it on the back of the letter. I talked to his mom, and it seems like he is doing really well.  I'm going to Austin tonight with Krys to see a band. It will be interesting to see if N. has anything to say to me...

      I haven't bitten my fingernails in 9 days. Anyone who knows me knows this is a huge deal. It's such a bad, disgusting habit. We'll see if I make it through the first week of school. That will be the true test, and if I can do that, I should be cool.  We had a family reunion on Saturday. I have about 20 cousins under 14. I took 6 of them to see the village on Friday. I liked the movie. But I was expecting a scary movie, that I could use to scare the kids and was a little let down by that. Good times though. Lots of Laughing all week long.  I move in the morning so this will probably be the last post for a while. I am supposed to have internet by Weds. but we'll see.  Lots to look forward too. Moving, Law school, surfing with Wayne, haven't seen Krys in about 2 months, roadtrips to Austin...
