       Well around 3 me adam and jake went outside and smoked a pipe. About 5 minutes after we got inside I hear jake go "it's the cops!" I thought he was joking at first but then heard someone knocking at the door. Appearently one of my neighbors (and theres only 1 possable neighbor that could have seen us) called the police on us for smoking. They said they saw us smoking pot out of a pipe. Now of course I said we were just smoking cigarettes. The cops seemed satisfyed until one of them saw an empty pack of papers laying there. He said they couldn't do anythign because they didn't see us, but next time if they do catch us someone is going to be arrested. Well fuck them lol, I'm a minor and have under 100 grams, so they can kiss my sweet I'll only get probation balls :) Althought this isn't a good start to a good summer. The cops have been here about 6 times in the last month or 2 for various reasons including the time we were shooting a bb gun and they came thinking we were carrying a shotgun around the back yard!

       Ight so check this out, a few days ago me jake and adam are chillin upstres. 3 dudes bust in my house 2 run to tha basement and 1 stands at the landing. I run over and am like who the fuck is here. This nig flashes a fake badge and says hes the cops and its a drug bust and tells me to come to the basement. I basicly laughed in his face and said "your not a fucking cop get the fuck outta my house" I told him I was bout to call the cops on him and walked to the phone, he ran after me going naw im kiddin im kiddin... so he was like lemme get a bag. I said I dunno what the fuck your talkin about I don't sell shit get outta my house. After a little bit of arguing he left. However I didn't know his 2 duedes were in my basement, so by the time he left I was an ounce short. That rally sux. Now i've already made the money back and everything, but this nigger shit just pisses me off.     Music: Eminem - beyond average Mood: just something that happened. The niggers WILL be literally killed for it Face: >:> Learned: Don't leave your door unlocked and next time, just stab don't ask questions

       So yesterday was awsome! I woke up at 9 fucking am to go fix danielle's fence for her dad. He was drunk last week and told me, jake and adam he'd pay us $25 a piece to fix it. So me and adam went to fix it, it only took us 3 hours and we got paid. We then went and smoked a bunch and sat around lazy til about 4. Then I went to adam's mom's house and hung out with adam jake joe (adam's stepdad) adam's mom and this guy chris. Me and adam ate a vicodin and then each drank a 6 pack, smoked mad bud an some opioum. We had a huge fire, the flames were atleast 10 ft. high. There's railroad tracks behind their property so joe threw on 2 10 ft. big railroad ties! He said it's just a preview of whats to come on the party he's throwing on the 3rd. He also got a huge box of fireworks for the party :) There was so much food too. Just for the 3 of us adam's mom bought us 5 lbs of hamburger, 3 lbs of potato salad, and 2 lbs of brats, we ate it all, I'm so full still! Most of the night was spent aorund the fire and then everyone went to the basement and we all played pool for about 2 hours. me jake and adam went and passed out around 1. This moring I woke up to a nice wake n bake. We also smoked a nice chunk of opioum this moring. I was lazy the whole day. Danielle came over around 1 and we stayed there til about 3. Then around 3 we left, adam stayed there and danielle went to work but me and jake chilled with ashley (danielle's sister) and her new boyfriend alex. We sat around the whole day mostly, just smoked a few blunts and played some ball. I was dissapointed to hear one of my friend's fixed the kids car that jake kicked in. So now I'm thinking we have to go and do some more damage to get our point across :) It's ignorent and mean but the kid shoulda never stole my dudes plants. Well now I'm just gunna play some games, smoke some weed and chill for the night. Tomrrow I start the look for a new job :(     Music: Jay-z - Public service announcement "My name is hov, H to the O V, I used to move snow flakes by the O Z" "Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect us, shoot at you actors like movie projectors" "I got a hustler spirit, nigga period Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer No matter where you go, you are what you are player And you can try to change but that's just the top layer Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here Only God can judge me, so I'm gone Either love me, or leave me alone" Mood: Awsome weekend, can't wait for all the parties next weekend. Face: >:) Learned: Smoke more, drink more, blow more, party hard

       Yesterday I had a cookout :) In the morning I went to the metro parks with dave and janiene. We walked around there for like 2 hours and saw almost all the spots. It was cool cause dave managed to get a trutle outta the lake, we we're trying to get a big foot long frog but they're just to damn fast. We also hit up the duck pound, but the best thign we saw was in the little pond there was a family of like 6 ducks and 20 kids and when they we're going across the pond the little baby ducks were running across the tops of the lili pads. It was so cool to see the little ducks like that, it almost looked like they were walkin on water. After that around 4 we went and picked up jake, then went back to janiene's and went swimming. While swimming it was just me and dave trying to dunk each other. For the last year whenever me and him are in a pool all we do is wrestle and try to put the other one under, lots of fun lol. So after wrestling around in the pool for like 40 minutes we packed up and left. We went to the store and I bought a pack of buns and 3 lbs of burger. We all went to jake's house and had a nice little cookout. I ate 4 burgers!!! I was so hungry cause 2 days a go I forgot to eat so I didn't have 1 thing the entire day, so yesterday I was starved! It was halarious when we were there cause jake's step mom is a totall bitch, but his dad works nights so it's always just her there. She tryed tell jake he couldn't have anyone there and then started bitching about the food (cause she thought it was hers) so jake just started flipping out on her and when we walks out of the house all you hear is him going "fuck off nancy, go lick a dick" "fuck you bitch, this isn't your house" an tons more of fun things like that lol. So after the cookout we left and went to my house house where we smoked for a little while. After a nice little roast session dave and janiene left and then me and jake went to walk to adam's sister's house. He babysits there like 4 nights a week but his sister works til like 4 in the morning (shes a bartender) so he stays the night. So we got there around 10 then around 10:45 danielle got there. We went to the addic and chilled around and smoked a bunch and watch rambo first blood, part2. It was an alright movie, but not nearly as good as part 1. Well around 1 or so danielle took me and jake home, but she bought us taco bell on the way :) It was so good. After I got home I passed right the hell out, I was so tired from all the walking, swimming, and wrestling.     Music: Twiztid - DieMuthaFuckaDie "I smoke too many cigarettes and get high to much, don't work enough shits to rough, I could give a fuck less if the whole world blow up, or what gang signs nigga thorw up" "In my eyes a look of terror cold as ice, so what if I slit my wrist once or twice" "Die, Die, Die MUTHA FUCKA DIE MUTHA FUCKA DIE!" Mood: Relaxed for summer Face: :-> Learned: I alrady knew this, but don't wear all black on a very hot sunny day. Atleast don't unless you wanna be super hot.

       REVENGE IS SWEET!  Alright, well last summer my friend was growing some plants in his backyard (obvisly you know what he was growing) So, we went to this party, and met this kid (it was his party) he was a totall fag, and well we were drunk... so I got a lot of people to leave his party, my one friend took his knife and carved really big into a $3,000 wood table (brand new) "I HAD A PARTY", and my other friend, the one growing the plants took every glass jar out of his fridge and then whipped them in his basement. Well after all this, this kid put a knife to my dudes throat and then a week later stole his plants. So for a little over a year now I've been trying to get this kid to fight me, well danielle's sister ashley called this kid to get her a bottle, it just so happens that the kid couldn't do it so he sent his friend, which happened to be the plant stealing fag. Now when this kid pulls up I walk to his car and go "Sup bitch, remember takin my boys plants?" and he giggled a little and then said yes and looked up (cause he wasn't lookin at me) as soon as he saw who I was (becuase I called him for months after it telling him I was gunna beat his ass) he rolled his window up and then I started yellin at him to get out of his car, he wouldn't. So I'm standing in front of his car yelling and he drives right at me, I had to drive and jump between 2 parked cars (it was in a parking lot) so he couldn't hit me. While I was in between the cars my dude jake comes outta nowhere and starts yelling at the top of his lungs "YOU MOTHER FUCKER!" and boots in the back of his car, then he backs up, swirves at jake but misses and then jakes starts booting in the car more. After that I was still yelling at the kid but he wouldn't get out and he just skirted off fast as hell. While he was driving away you could clearly see from a far his back right door is cracked literally in half and smashed in and his back right wheel well is entirly smashed in. I love the fact my being 17 can get in a 21 yr olds face screaming at him and he's to pussy to get out of his car and fight me... such bitches, So finally after a year, there was some justice served.  Well before this I sat around all morning til about 3. Then I went with jake and walked over to ashley's house (shes danielle's lil sister, they live at the same place) and then I chilled with her, jake, and 173rd alex. For the first time ina few months I spent the whole day with ashley and just blew mad K. If you don't know what special K is then go look it up.  and well after all that I went out to the movies with ash, jake, dani, and alex. Although I got ina huge fight with dani today and she hated me, I got her to love me agian I think :) We went and saw dodgeball. It was an alright movie, the plot was clesha but it made me laugh a lot so I guess it was a good movie. "Dislexic players are not allowd on the court" lol. Well I'm going to go have my morning cigarette, have a good day.    Music: AnyBodyKilla - Hollow point "Sit back and let me take into the mind of a killer, dark carnival psychopathic wig splitta"  "Cause in detroit we got mother fuckin problems, and all the gun play you hear is my homies tryin to slove um" "You can't tell me anything, hollow points controll the game, I can tell you, once that trigger, thing'll never be the same" Mood: happy Face: n_n Learned: I always talk about karma coming around, and I don't stress payback, because I know it will come eventually. This is proof I am right. Over a year later and then bam, the back right half of his car is smashed in. I'm sure it'll cost him nice. I also learned some people are pussy's their whole life. And I learned it's not worth thorwing away a relationshop over things things that happened a long time a go. I haven't trusted danielle for almost 2 years because of something that happened. and now I see that I'm not gunna find another girl that love me as much as her, so I think for now, I'm going to work on making us better again.

       Well today was a longggg day. I started it off by wakin up around 8 am. My dude adam spent the night so I woke him up too. The majority of my morning was spent playing counter-strike and smokin buds. Around like 3 or 4 I went to the metro parks about 30 mins away with adam, dave, janiene, and jake. We went out there and walked around the enitre park! we were walking for atleast a good hour, maybe hour and a half. and we only walked on like half of the trails if even that. Afetr this we went back to jake's house where we hung out for a while. I called this girl danielle (we dated for like 2 years, but no more) and asked her over, when she came over I hide in the dark corner of the garage and my friends adam and jake sat there talking with her to see what she'd say about me when I'm not around. She talked about how much of an asshole I was and a bunch of stuff so I got pissed and told her to go home. Then I called her to tell her to come back but she hung up on me and wouldn't answer her phone. So I walked 1/2 an hour from my friends house to her house just to talk to her. After I got there I had to talk her into it but she finally came outside to talk with me and we have things to work out but I don't wanna not be friend't with her. Although I was a dick and started calling her a bitch and a slut... sometimes I need to learn to controll my words. Well it's getting kinda late now and I might go to the last day of summer school but don't know since I really have only gone to 2, half days of it in the last 2 weeks, it really doesn't matter at this point. So I'm gunna go off to bed. Good night all...    Music: Eminem - Kill you Mood: raged Face: >:0 Learned: I need to controll my words, they piss a lot of people off. I also have further proved my own point that all women are crazy.

       Well the last few days have been pretty boring and slow for me. I've been laying low for a while for a few reasons and am gunna be for a while until things cool down. I met this really cool 45 year old ladie. She introduced me to her 16 year old daughter, very cute I may add :) Upon going through her house this ladie revealed all her furnature, lamps, plants and everything is from trash picking... which amazed me and my friend's because everything she has looks perfect and so nice. But other than meeting this ladie I just been lounging around being lazy and doing nothing. But my friend dave went out to bumville no where with his girlfriend to go to her family reunion. While he's out there since it's all wide open feilds he's going to go mushroom picking. He's gunna bring back 4 or 5 different kinds and hopfully upon looking them up and doing some research some of them will be good. Well it's getting kinda late so I'm gunna go smoke my bed time pipe and hit the hay, well the couch, lol.    Music: Slipknot - Interpoler (demo) Mood: tired Face: -_-

       Ok, now I an understand if you don't wanna do something then don't do it. but I have to say one thing that seriously pisses me off is when a girl whines like a fucking 5 years old for no reason, just to bitch, I will seriously slap a girl about this kinda thing. So anyways yesterday I went to go to the metro-parks with my friends jake, dave, and jeniene. Now you have to understand, jeniene is the typical blonde. She acts dumb as fuck (although she isn't) and she whines every 10 minutes about something, it's discusting that dave puts up with it. So we were going to the park to smoke a L. So we get the park and start walking through it, now jeniene could have just sat in the car for a while but deicded she wants to come with us, even though she didn't, she doesn't smoke, doesn't like the parks, and was wearing sandles. So of course she was basicly just coming so she could bitch to dave. We get to our usuall clearing with a waterfall right down the path and start to walk towards it. Of course without fail there she goes, ranting and ranting about how miserbal she is and how she doesn't have shoes on. It's about this point where if dave wouldn't have been there I would have smacked her in the face and then left here there... Yes it's her car, but I would have stolen it cause I was so pissed. So of course dave just says ok and the 20 minutes drive, 15 minute walk, and the 30 minutes we waited for jeniene to get to my house we're all for nothing cause this dumb blonde bitch doesn't feel like getting her fucking meet muddy. Things like this just enrage me so bad. Well aside from that I didn't do anything yesterday. After that I made her take us to my house and she had the never to try and get us to go out again somewhere else with her, another fucking park none the less. this is the point where I wanted to shoot her. This girl complanes, and LITERALLY CRIES cause she doesn't wanna be at the park, then we get to my house and she's asking us to go to a different one. FUCK ALL DUMB BLONDE BITCHES AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! So dave and jeniene left and me and jake just sat around all day smokin, which of course if just every single day for me lol... the life of a pothead      Music: D12 - Git up Mood: Just awake, still mad Face: :p

       ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! So as I was talking about my job and how it was weird and stuff, well we've come to the conclusion my cock dad owns the place. Now everyone, you gotta understand my dad is a dick. Since my parents have been divorced my dad now owns 3 different bussinesses all registered in other people's names. He keeps a part time job on the side (which I think he owns part of that shop too and it's just another front) so he only has to pay child support as if he made 12.5K a year. However, this asshole owns a tanning salon, a bar, %99 sure this sub shop, and I think possably a game warehouse. So while this asshole that just bought a new house, new big screen flat screen tv, new car, and tons of other shit and sits there, I gotta sit here fucking poor wishing he'd pay more money. I hate my family extremely and I wish I was never born. My whole damn life I don't even know what my dad really does cause he registers everything he gets in other people's names so he can't get sued for it or lose it if he gets divorced. Thats how he kept everything when he divorced my mom, and I'm pretty sure hes gunna do it again to my step mom. I hope none of you have to deal with an asshole like this (and this is just the tip of the iceberg, trust me) Well I'm ina pissy mood now cause I found this out yesterday, or atleast came with the theory, which makes perfect sence, especially since he already has done this multipal times. So, it's defanitly time for me to go blaze. All you thousands of readers have a good day. lol.    Music: Tupac & Notorious B.I.G. - Runnin Mood: Unstable and violent Face:  o0

       Well today was actually an alright day. And I would like say after being employeed for a whoping 1 day I have quit my new job lol. It's because my dad got me the job and my dad is a dick and since his friend is who I'd be working for he would use it agenst me. For example if I didn't feel like going to a stupid family get together and didn't go then he would tell me I didn't go so I was gunna lose $50 and have it takin out of my pay. (yes my dad is that much of an asshole and so much more, I haven't been to a family event on his side in over 3 years) But aside from that, when I got to summer school there was a kid that robbed me (With a gun) there. Now keep in mind this little nigger (sorry fo whom it may offend) is scrany and I would demolish, but however when he had a piece and I didn't, well, what could I do... So I left school early because the only thoughts in my head were to walk up, start choking him and just merk him in front of the class... but like I said I just got up and left for the day, I didn't wanna get arrested today. So after that I went to jake's house. As soon as I pull up theres a damn moving truck next to his house and his dad asked me if I would help them move his sisters things out. So me, adam and jake moved all her crap til this truck was fuckin jam packed full. After that thrilling experence I went upto matt's house and just hung out for a few hours, came home, then went back to matts. When I was there in the evening it was awsome because there was like 20 people there at one point, most just me, matt, jake, adam and like 10 girls. and one girl was from cali. and most of them wern't even from around there they were from cities around us, so it was pretty cool to chill with people we usually don't kick it with. Well after that I came home and here I am being lazy me just sitting around again. Well I think I'm gunna go play some counter-strike or something. goodnite    Music: None Mood: Tired but happy Face: -_-

       Well I started my first day of work yesterday, I guess it wasn't that bad, it was work what more can I say. I work at a place called sharpeys, its a sub shop. I was kinda upset cause I didn't think they servered hot food, but I was wrong so the kitchen in like 1,000 degreees all the time, I thought it would be more like subway. I gotta learn how to cook cold and hot food, clean everything, work the registers and the phone and a few other various things in less than a month, atleast thats what my boss wants so he and his wife don't have to come in to work that much any more. My boss's name is john, hes an alright guy I guess. He seems like he should be on king of the hill. he's very old fashion and slow talkin... but for some reason I don't think I'll have this job long. But other than that I've been trying to find a ride to summer school for the last 2 hours cause I need to make up a lot of credits, I have 12.5 and I need 22.5 to graduate and I'm suppost to be a seniour this year, so I'm pretty behind. Well soon I'm gunna put on a mic and spit some of my shit for ya'll to hear see if ya like me at all, not that I care about you if you don't :)    Music: D12 - Loyalty (ft. obie trice) Mood: Rushed and anxious Face: 6_6

       I got a new 9-5! I now work at sharpeys subs next to my dad's (who I fucking hate and want to die) bar.    Yo wassup? I got a little hangover right now from a 40 of bud and a 6 of mike's hard. I had a sleep over with my girl danielle last night and she drank a 6 of mikes too, must say it was a bomb night :)  Yesterday was fun, I went out to the beach with my dude jake and dave and jeniene. It was hot out but the water was still so damn cold I thought I was gunna die when we went in. The last few days for the beginging of summer have been a blur pretty much. All I've  been doing is running back and forth between the cities all day smokin soooo much and then drinking and eating vicodin almost everyday so far. This weekend is ripplefest, which is a huge hippi festival. Not as good as hookahville but I'll talk about that ina different post when I'm really bored. Well my little annoying sister is here with a friend so I'm gunna cut it short and go to the basement, bye bye

       Well last night I had 3 weird dreams at once I guess. The first one danielle was screwing like 10 guys in front me and that was the whole dream, then it fadded into another dream and I was at some weird house and ate like 10 krumpers and then was walkin around the backyard of the house looking for a place to piss and I had like weird crap chasing me, I can't really describe what it looked like, and after that I was just standing in my own bathroom but there was no toilet and there was a huge clear hot water tank. then I woke up and had to take a huge piss. I ono, I wish I could record dreams.

       Well I Reall'y don't remember too much from two days a go but yesterday..  My day started with thrilling summer school. Which really wasn't that bad all thing considered I just sit there and talk with my dudes. So after that I dipped around noon to the house where I had like 8 people there in a matter of 2 mins, and since I'm always having so many people here my mom is having the neighbor call her at work when theres car goin in and out so I got bitched at for that.  After that I went up to my dude matt's house and smoked a bunch of dank and chilled with matt, dave, jeniene, jake, adam, danielle, illya, and nikki. After matt's house I came down to my house where I had this girl over. I picked up a 6 of mikes hard for her and a 40 of bud for me. Well I drank the 40 and 2 of her mike's :)  So after chillin with her from like 5-10 I had my dude E over. Literally 1 minute after he gets in there was a bag of weed layin on the table (thank god it was what I was just smokin on, there was only like .5 in there) and he just picked it up to look at it and my mom came down at that exact second. although she doesn't mind me smoking she flips when she sees it, and since it was in E's hands it was worse cause then she thinks its my friends and not me :/  So anyways she started yellin and kicked everyone out so I dipped over to my dude jakes house with jenn and E around 11. After we got to jake's E gamme a vic, which really helped with all the alcohol ^_^ dave and jeniene also came over and we all sat outside roastin like 4 different kinds of bud and chilled for a little bit.  Around 11:45 I had my dude E take my back home (my mom was alseep) so I had my woman danielle over. and to say the least we had another great night like the one before, from midnight til 2 in the mornin was feelin good the whole time n_n  So now I'm awake again and ready for a thrilling saturday, I'll probally get really fucked up and go do some wild shit again. Have a good weekend everyone.    p.s. While sitting around toasted at matt's house I came up with this idea. We are goiong to go to a marathon and then beat the shit outta the guys that hand out glasses of water. After that we're gunna fill them glasses with piss cause when them runners grab the cups in less than a sec its either splashed on their face or in the back of their throat and there ain't nothing they can do... if they stop to bitch they'll lose the race :)  heheh I ono it made me laugh

       Well yesterday was mostly just sitting around. I woke up to my friend E at the door so me and him chilled for a while, suprizingly he gave me 5 vicodin for free, which I loved! (yum yum) then my friend jake came over. My menally ill mom took my vaporizer before but told me if I found someone to buy it should would give it back so I could pay part of my cell phone bill that was $160. If you never seen a vaporizer  urlLink http://bcvaporizer.com  So E wanted to buy it, but sure enough my mom stright admited to my face she lied to me and wasn't going to give it back. That made me pretty mad. So after that I pretty much just sat around all day with my friend jake. But I did have a couple hour long conversation with this really cool girl that lives about an hour and a half away I met online through some fourms  urlLink www.zerovision.net . I'm hoping to go out and meet her sometime this summer cause she seems really cool.  Later on that night danielle came over whens he was off work and we had wild sex for a good two hours or so. The only bad thing about the day was I ate too much vic and threw up 2 times, but I've become used to the side effect. Well I'm off to to summer arc tech so I can catch up on some credits cause I'm suppost to be a seniour next year and you need 22.5 credits to graduate... well i only have 12.5 right now, so I'm just a lil behind lol :)  Well off I go to get dressed, I'll be back later :)

       Well today I got ina huge ass fight with danielle, which is nothing new at all. It ended up with her hading me a note that said "get out of my life" and she told me to leave her house and not come back, so I don't know if I'll ever see her again. :(  Before this happened though I went to buy some buds, and well to say the least I'm pissed. I trusted my friend to get it for me and sure enough as I was hopping it wouldn't happen the bud was some trash >_  Well after dani's I went with up to my friend matt's house and chilled with my friends nikki, mike, other nikki, jake, dave, jeniene, and erin. Mostly just sitting around smoking. But to top that off we found a frog so I picked it up and it started pissing on me! It was horrible you could see the stream shooting out! I'm sorry for anyone that takes offences to this (well I'm really not) but I was so pissed I through that fucker atleast a good 200 ft. I went to look for it after but couldn't find it in matt's backayrd. (his yard is friggin huge it's about the size of my front yard, back yard, and house together lol  and after that fabulous day I walked 2 miles home with my friend jake and got some taco bell on the way ^_^  Well thats about the basic stuff I went through today, I'll be back tomrrow :)

       Well yesterday was a very long and interesting day.  It started with me going over to my friend dave's house. We sat around there and smoked some and watch lord of the rings 3 again. After that danielle (she was my girlfriend for a year and a half but we haven't been going out since december) came and picked me up and we went to her house because I was going to have dinner with her family and go to graduation with them (it's her graduation).  So I got there and it wasn't too bad, I hung out with her sister (ashley) a lot and we just chilled and ate, then me and ash each ate 5 10mg valume and left fot the show.  It was down at the playhouse theature, it was very nice. So as soon as we get down there we want a drink and they're not selling any there. So me and ashley walk around downtown just trying to find a pop lol. We finally found one after 30 mins of walking and went back to our seats, where we each ate another 5 V's. After that we felt so lazy we wern't goign anywhere.  The only bad thing about the place was this asshole guy sitting in front of us, we were talking and he whipped round (this being a 60 yr old red faced man) and says "you talk to much and need to shut the hell up." So i was very poliate (which happens and if it wans't danielle's graduation I would have gone off on this fuck) and said "sir, that was very uncalled for you could have politly asked us to be quite" well he told us "shut the fuck up or leave" so fuck that bald fuck!  We finally got to see dani go across the stage and she looked so beautiful and perfect, me and ash claped and screamed so loud (even though you not suppost to clap) lol. After all this we finally went to my friend adam sister's house. me, dani, jake, and adam chilled there for a while and played some x-box, I drank some nice grey goose vodka and we smoke some weed.  After adam sister's we left and went to my friend christina's house cause she was having a lil party thing. there was about 20-30 people when we got there and it was nice. So we sat there for a while and I drank A LOT on top on those valume, I still feel very drunk or high or something right now even after sleeping. But over all, the night was an awsome time and I got to see over 5 of my good friends graduate so I'm happy for all of um!  Well thats about all the details I fell like going into now, thanks for reading this is anyone who actually did, send me a comment back and make me feel special :)

        In less than 2 weeks I'm going to go to summer hookah at nlqp. Now I've been waiting soooo long   for this. after spring hookahville I've been dying to go to another.  Now this isn't hookahville or at the same place, but it's the same  bands basicly and it's the same shit. It'll just be like 2,000-3,000  and more local instead of 20,000-30,000 from all states. click the link if you would like info about it.    I sat around at the carnival again yesterday. It seems no matter  what I do danielle just makes me either mad or sad every single day by  the end of the day. I don't think she has any common sence what-so-ever  and she has a habbit of telling one storie early off but if we're  arguing about the same thing later she'll have a different  storie  that makes her right, even if shes blatently wrong. I dunno, I feel bad  for bubba (the carni) we went back to his trailer yesterday when he got  off and there was $100 missing. I didn't take it but I  suspect one  of my friends might of, but bubba said hes misplaced money tons of  times so I'll wait til later today to see if I should check my friends.  yesterday was hot as fuck though! I was burning up the whole  day  and I was in the sun pretty much from about noon til sundown. Well  anyways I gotta go get ready to do shit and adam's in my basement cause  he crashed here last night.  Well I'll be back     Music: Tech N9ne - Einstein  Mood: Grogy, just awake   Face: -_-  Learned: wear sunscreen and watch your friends closly

       Well I've been hanging out at the carnival. It's been pretty awsome, yesterday was opening day. There was probally a good couple thousand people there. Of course there was a fight, and it kicked ass cause it was SE-L v. mayfeild (our rival city for everything) and the kids got made to look like bitches stright up. One kid jumped on a mayfeild kid and started jackin him in the head. The other one just walked up and blasted a mayfeild kid once, he instanly hit the ground and when he got up his nose was gushing blood. Other than that I just been runnin around socializing. I really wanna get some numbers, theres so many hot girls there. But I still dunno my situation with danielle, fuck life is confusing, on the up though I've been making good money but I dropped a god damn $20 bill ysterday! oh well life will go on.  Well I gotta go get ready and then go back up there and hang out with the carni's and then sit at the carnival and make me some mo money. if yuou live aorund you should come visit it!

       The carnival at one of the churches has come to town now. I met all the carni's last year and my friend hooked um up with the bud, now it's me :) So for the last 2 days I been pretty much just chillin over with the carni's. It's cool cause they all got trailers and shit to chill in, and when the actuall carnival is going on I just sit there and make mad money. The carni I know the best is bubba, hes like only 1 of 3 thats still left from last year when they came (theres atleast 20 game operators alone) Me and Danielle are no longer fighitng. But we did have sex agian :( This is my biggest problem ever, I'm pretty sure that we're just trying to stay together for the sex number one, and partially just for the fact we went out for 2 years and we don't wanna make it for nothing. I saw jenn this weekend but I don't think she really cares for me and just the way she always led me on if she doesn't wanna have a relationship with me then I don't need to see her anymore. So I probally won't see her anymore. However I have been doing tons of walking recently. I musta walked a good 7 miles yesterday around the city. Which isn't too much but I got used to having to walk about 0. Now that everyone works all day I don't get as many rides to places, oh well. Well I've been having really mixed feeling latly and just sitting back for summer I guess. Within the next few days plenty of interesting things will happen. I'll be sure to post. Oh and 3 days a go danielle totalled her car in an accident. No one was hurt or anything, but the cars got fucked up. Danielle was going to clear the intersection after the car in front of her had already cleared it, she was in the intersection the whole time. and she said that this lady ran through the red light and hit the side of her. However since danielle has no proof that the light was red right now the officer sighted her for failure to stop on a turn or something like that and she has court next monday. I hope she wins :/    Music: None now Mood: do do do do  Face: :) Learned: Carni's are hustlers. Don't try to hustle a hustler.

       I've been very depressed latly. I hadn't cut myself in about a year but this is now the 2nd time I've done it this week. I don't really want to be alive anymore. Danielle makes me want to die so horrably, plus everything else in my life is terrabol from death threats I get to the fact I always fight with my friends and family. I don't know what to do anymore. If I never post back again then I've taken myself out of this world. I actually hope I can force myself to do it.

       2 days a go was a bad day I guess, I went insane and destroyed my room and shit, not very good. But yesterday was alright. Tony came out here for the first time in almost 6 months. Tony is my good friend that lived out here but he moved away when we went into 8th grade. He used to come out about every weekend but it's been a while, I'm glad I get to chill with him again. When he got here I walked to this girl maggie's house. After chillin there for a while we went to this jessica girls house. She's pretty good lookin, I used to be friend with her and chill back a few years a go but haven't talked to her ina few years, so it was cool to see and chill with her. We chilled for a while there, there was like 8 or 10 people. While at jess's we went across the street to some russian girl's house to smoke. While tony, jake, adam and me were in the basement I was punching the punching bag they had and tony kept telling me to hit it harder so I did, and then *snap* the chain ripped right out of the cealing! I felt kinda bad, but at the same time it was really funny. It was also all white and cloth and when jake was hittin it before me he had a cut on his knuckle and stained blood all over it lol. So after that we walked on over to my house where we sat for a second, then we walked on over to jakes. After sittin at jakes for a while we got pick up and went to matt's. It was matt, nikki, christina, dave, janiene, jake, adam, tony, and me. We discussed if were going camping this weekend. Me and jake agreed to go if we went to nelson's ledges, so I'm waiting to hear from nikki on how much it is and if were going. After matt's we got a ride home and adam and tony came to my house to spend the night. Around 11:30 danielle came over, she stayed for like an hour or two and then took me to taco bell at like 1:30 then dropped me back off at home and she left. I really am starting to hate her so much, shes such a lier and a bad person >_ If you have never seen the show "Travel Sick" you need to. Some guy from britian is travling around the world and they make him do horrable things. It's about 10 times worse than jackass I'd say. Last night he had to brush a crocadile's teeth with a regular toothbrush, he had a to kiss a dead corpse (this was sick!) and because he failed one of his missions he had to eat a fresh fryed scorpian. Well my last 2 days haven't been too bad. I been going out and doing a lot I guess. Well today I'll might see dani for a little but then I wanna either wanna go to jess's or hang out with jenn or something. Well have a good weekend everyone :)   Music: Too early I'm not awake yet Mood: It's summer  Face: :) Learned: Hrmm, well nothing I've just been sittin around havin fun

       On the 4th me adam and jake went to jake's house around 9 and were greeted with a nice steak dinner and salad for us all. I must say thanks again jake's dad :) Yesterday was a lot of walking, a lot. I walked from my house to matt's (3 mi.) then from matt's to jake's (2.5 mi.) and I walked as few other places plus at matt's most of us being there was us just runnin around outside. I'm starting to get worried though, I think I'm gunna have a scare on the back of my foot cause the plastic insdie my vans was bent and sharp and for a while was rubbing my foot and cut it up. even though I got new shoes they still rub the shit all the time and it hurts :/ now I know how woman feel, lol. Me and danielle are at the end of our relationship I think. We have been ina fight for a few days now and every day that goes by makes me wanna talk to her again less and less. like 2 weeks a go she was about to go to this guys house after work and we got ina fight about it, so she didn't go. well a few days a go she called me when she was off work and left me a voice mail saying "Please don't get mad but I'm going to wayne's house." This was after we went to a 2 day party and I left all my shit in her car (including my toothbrush) and I was just gunna get it when she was off work. But I don't know, danielle is not the person she used to be at all. I don't even feel like I know her anymore, which sucks really bad because I love her so much, yet I have zero trust for her and I sometimes can't even stand to be around here anymore. Well I guess theres nothing I can do about it now and I might as well start trying to get over it... my first time coming out of a relationship this long, 2 years.

The only thing you can do is hold on and try to move on and forget.

       HAPPY 4TH!!!    This weekend was insane. All I did was party the last 2 days ina row and I have more to go. I stayed the weekend over at my friend's mom's house and I drank more saturday night than I ever have any other day in my life. The entire weekend was just a big tent party, me adam and jake went to it. Friday was just like 10 people sittin round drinkin and msokin all night, but saturday was pary time. There were over 200 beers in the cooler and 250 jello shots. On saturday alone I drank a case of bud to myself and somewhere between 30-40 jello shots, i was more than wasted. There were a bunch of fireworks too, and not cheap ones the good ones. We also had m-500's (half sticks) plus there was 2 places with fireworks displays we could see form the house we were at so we watched fireworks for like an hour stright. The amount of bud we smoked this weekend was rediculas too, we really did it up and smoked about 2 oz's in less than 2 days lol. I've been giggling like schoolgirl all fucking weekend. Well right now I'm about to shower and shave which is much needed, get dressed, go pick up a case, and do the same damn thing again :) Gotta love summer ^_^    Music: Twiztid - Maniac killa Mood: PARTY ALL WEEKEND! HAPPY 4TH! Face:   Learned: I don't think I learned anything... I think I forgot a lot of what I've learned.
