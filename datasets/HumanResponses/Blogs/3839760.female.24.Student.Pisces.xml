      Today I felt totally embarrassed and retarded. It wasn't so much that I messed up at work but that someone who has more experience than me, made me feel like crap. I already know that I struggle even with the most basic functions in math, but this girl must have thought I was a total retard.  I can't shake the feeling of stupidness. All my life I have struggled with this stupid dialexia (spelling?) feeling in math. It's silly but even the most simply additions stump me and I need to be left alone otherwise I get nervous and mess up even more. That happened today. It's hard not to feel that way, since I fought that helpless feeling in high school and had to battle the constant&nbsp;feeling of stupidness.&nbsp; I hope I can do this...  I don't want to give up or quit, I know I need to give myself some breathing room to make mistakes but I still don't have to like it...Until then...

      It seems that these days I have been running late everywhere I go. I hate being late! It just looks so irresponsible to be late and it does not look good. Argggrrr!!  Tomorrow I am supposed to be starting my new job at Chapters but unfortunately my boss at my current job is being a pain in the butt and will not let me have tomorrow off, so now I got to be in two places at once!! I called Chapters to re-schedule but so far I have not heard anything.  Lord, I need a miracle and I know you hear cries like mine! I hope next week is better. My old roommate of 2 years is getting married next week! Crazy but good! I hope that the weather is nice and I hope it all turns out.  The whole thing marriage is so weird! Maybe it's only weird to me since I have so much excess baggage!!

      So I was late for my interview!! Ahhgg! I hate being late to stuff like that! Other than that, the interview went well. It was a group interview, which was a little bizarre. They said that if one gets a call tonight then they had the possibility of getting a job or another interview...so far nothing...I keep hoping. I will see...

      I have an interview later on this afternoon. 5pm to be exact. I am trying not to stress out about the whole thing...first I start thinking that somehow I will miss the bus and not get there in time, then I think about my apperance and then what if I don't get the job and get totally stuck in this crap one I have now.  However, I need to stop and just be faithful and be confident that things turn out for a reasons, yet all that seems really quite useless to me at this moment. Well..until then, I will see what happens.

      I am finding it hard to find contenment and simply being happy in my everyday life.  I often find that I spend so much time wishing that I was someone else or somewhere else.  Yet, my life is this: I am only working part-time at a golf camp for kids, even though I have no skill in this area.  I feel completely abandoned by my employer and find myself questioniong my skills and knowledge although the job is not that difficult.  I find that I am doing it all on my own.  I miss the Mustard Seed and the supportive staff (not perfect, but supportive).  I miss being challenged and finding that I love my job. I am in a desert and I am only the only one and the only person around is God. I know that if I keep seeking I will find something...but for now...the thirst is overwhelming... I need to be reassured that everything will be okay and that although my future is blurry and unknown, I will become someone that is better and able to help others...I guess I just feel this desert pressing down on me and I feel that not knowing is a scary place to be...yet I will be 'strenghthened in my inner being with power through his Spirit'...that is all I have to hang on to...those roots that can't be pulled...

      Nice title hey! It has been 2 days in the new job. It's okay...I mean it doesn't totally suck or anything but the bugs and the sun!! I have a sunburn on my chest and neck and tons of mosquito bites on my legs.  I have an interview on monday, I don't know how to deal with this idea that perhaps I can get a better job somewhere else.  I know I shouldn't complain but I want something that I can enjoy and use my talent in.  Carrying golf clubs all day is not my idea of a great job. Oh, well...not much to say. I am just keeping my faith, since that is all I seem to have in this desert land of mine.

      So...I guess this is it. I find the idea of posting my thoughts on the web a little ironic. You know the things I want to be private are there for anyone one with access to see.  Weird...Anyhow...I don't really have anything particularly interesting to say. I start this new job technically tomorrow but I am going in for training today. It's a little weird. I'll be teaching little kids how to play golf. Dude! I don't even know how to play golf!!! Holy Macro...what have I gotten myself into?! I guess I'll find out tomorrow. YIKES! I need a nap...so I'm going to sleep now. Bye.

      I can't tell you why...i don't know myself...but I continue to do the same things and the lack of self-worth sets in. If only, I could make myself stop...
