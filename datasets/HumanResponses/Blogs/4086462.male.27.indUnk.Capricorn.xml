      First Mate will be shipping off soon... I'll miss him even though we didn't actually see eachother that much what with us living in different cities.  But I'll miss the fact that I could have seen him.  When he's in Kuwait, I don't really have an option at all.

      Well, it's Friday night now, I leave tomorrow for California, then on to Seattle, Washington.  It's gonna be a great time and I am excited, but...  My wife has decided not to go up to Seattle with me.  I'm going to miss her a ton.  We've been through Europe together, 3 months in fact.  She's the best travel companian imaginable, and not just because she puts out!  She's smart, sexy, and willing and able to go anywhere, do anything.  I will miss her tons.  I can't count the number of times I've been told, by guys and girls, how lucky I am to have her.  All I can say to them is, "I know."

      Woo-hoooooooooo!  Last week I wasn't going to have a vacation this summer.  This week I've got one planned for June 19-27.  Should be a good time.  My sister and I are driving from LA to Seattle in her awesome H2.  The only bad part is that my wife will not be going...

      I was leaving the fun little place my wife and I ate lunch today and had a sudden thought about chivalry...   It occured to me that Men are considered chivalrous for opening doors for their Ladies to enter... wherever - car, house, restaurant, etc - first.  Then I started thinking, but what if there's someone waiting to kill, maim, kidnap or otherwise fuck up your day waiting for you to come through that door.  What if there's someone in the back seat of the car that you don't notice and you're putting your Lady into danger while you are just sauntering around the back of the car and over to your door?    Soooooo... next time the Lady bitches that you aren't opening doors for her anymore, just explain to her that you are really protecting her and she should appreciate that.  In fact, she should appreciate it so much that you should get road head.  Hehehehehe... there' just something special about road head.  As a side note, this makes me wonder who started the whole opening doors for ladies craze.  And was it to be nice... or to protect thier ass???

      Just ran accross this speech from Chief Seattle - chief of the Suquamish in Washington State, yes Seattle is named after him.  There are apparently 2 versions of the speech, both of which made me want to cry.  I'm pretty sure I was an Indian in a previous life...   urlLink See for yourselves...

      "TIME TO GET UP EVERYONE LET'S GO THE RIVER, COME ON WE HAVE TO GO GET UP " BLAH BLAH FUCKING BLAH.  Sucks to wake up to that after a long night out.  But that's what happened unfortunately.  Same guy every trip too.  It really just doesn't matter what time he passes out... and he is passing out.  In fact, it's the same guy that had pictures taken of a ceramic frog on his head with his own phone last nite.  Hehehe.  I guess this is his revenge or something.    We're up and out by about 8:30 I think... After a disappointing breakfast at Taco Cabana (too late we realized Whataburger was next door...) we hit the road to New Braunfels and the river.  We've been trying to contact Dillhole all this time, with no results to show for it.  He has his friend's car, he ditched us last night, and now he's ditching us for our river adventure.  Fuck him.  The river calls.  Wally Mart was as expected... cheap.  Our new friend buys all our shit though, so that's nice.  Once we're done loading up the coolers with our beer and our jug with Captain Morgan and Coke we head to a gas station where our new friend once again comes though and buys some rollin papers.  You see, he had been provided with some bud and joints needed to be rolled.  The man could roll a joint too, I shit you not.  Big ol fatties.  5 in fact.  We've been noticing all this time the place is packed, so that's nice.  There were tons of tents lining the river too, next time we gotta stay on the river!  Pretty much looked like a huge tent village.  An empty tent village... cause at this point everyone is on the frickin river!  Finally we're settled in with our 4 bottomless tubes for us  + 2 bottom-having cooler tubes, 1 of which was free.  New Friend went to the guy and told him he'd forgotten to give us the 1 we paid for.  Good trick, use it.  At this point you can tell our new friend was getting along with us just fine, eh?  I believe it's about 11:30 or so... yes it was.  I remember new friend blurting out, "It's cool that I've had a 6 pack and it's not even noon yet."  The next memorable moment came a short time later when our new friend proclaimed, "There's just something so free about being able to piss on yourself."  Cause, you know, ya gotta piss.  You're not gonna get out of the river to piss... this is actually a selling point for the bottomless tube, if you have a bottom you're gonna be sitting in your own piss much longer.  Just warning you.  Memorable moments on the river include...    The couple in the raft with their 2 bad ass labs.  They basically left around the time we did and stayed generally within sight of us the whole trip.  The labs were awesome, always jumping out of the raft and getting pulled back in.  Chasing sticks, balls, little children.  Ok, no little children, they wanted to though, I saw it in their eyes.  Although maybe that was the weed and beer talking...   Speaking of, that was a highlight, the huge joints we smoked occasionally.  Along with all the beer.  And the Captain Morgan of course.   Putting our new friend in charge of the 2 beer tubes.  Hehehe... initiation is hell, eh?   Losing my full beer while taking a picture of the rapids I'm going through and not realizing it or remembering I even had a beer until about 5 minutes later.  Then finding the beer floating by me and chasing it down.  No, I didn't drink the beer, I was saving the COOZIE!   Our knack... our god-given talent... of finding the SLOWEST POSSIBLE CURRENT in the river.  It was fucking ridiculous.  Of course, this did make our little tubing adventure last longer, giving us more time to do what we do best... drink beer!   The rope swing we swung on.  Good times... Any time a rope swing situation presents itself, my advice is to GO GO GO!   Beef Jerky.  Enough said.   After the river was a blur.  We took the bus back to our launching point, loaded up the car, and headed off to find some FOOD!  BBQ was calling my name, so we stop at this gas station that also has Authentic Texas BBQ! or something like that.  Sounds good!  We get out of the car and I root around in the trunk for my shirt and shoes - I didn't want to forget those again.    As I start heading towards the BBQ, I see my buddies heading back my way... followed by some guy.  Some guy calling the police apparently.  WTF?  I politely ask him WTF? and get a very hostile response.  He was an asshole who apparently had no time for drunks like us.  Fuck him we decided later, after driving off.  Fucker was still on the phone in the rearview mirror.  Apparently my friends were having some good natured drunken fun, like spitting on and pushing eachther.  On second thought, what a couple of fucking retards... As many drunk hillbillies come in that place, getting kicked out really takes some talent...  I was a bit pissed at first, having done nothing wrong and being denied my BBQ!  Luckily for the drunk fuckers we found another BBQ place down the road.  Bit expensive, but a goooood BBQ buffet.  Good stuff.  During all this we try to get a hold of Dillhole... no luck as you would expect.  And we really have no place to stay.  We might have been able to stay with my Austin buddy again, but we decided, despite having vowed not to earlier in the day, to drive on home.  So lucky me, I think it was even my idea, got to drive all the way back to Dallas... about 4 hours or so from where we were.  Mary Jane saw me through those rough times...  We dropped off our new friend at his place... a real nice place I must say.  Dillhole still had his car in Austin, but he didn't seem to care.  He's a cool guy - and he forgot the weed in my car... can I get a hell yea!  He even had Dillhole call me yesterday to make sure I knew so that I didn't get in trouble if I got pulled over.  And no he doesn't want the weed back either...   I dropped off my other 2 buddies and drove my ass home.  Unfortunately, an empty home.  Wifey was at her friend's new place helping with the decorations.  To be fair, I wasn't supposed to be coming home anyways...  I think I was home about 1:30 AM or so.  Long day, but good times.  No fucking canoe trip down the buffalo though...

      Past Tuesday was a day among days... Having an audition for a Play in the Uptown part of Dallas and feeling extremely nervous not only for the audition but for the fact that Tornados had been spotted in the metro! Fantastic light and wind show, like I was driving into the Perfect Storm or something... No shit, Driving down Maple Ave. Suddenly the lights, stop and lamp posts just go black, waiting for those little creepy creatures to emerge from ant hills and kill me since I cannot see shit, literally blacker than Arnold Jackson... Seeing that I'm headed deeper and deeper into this abyss, I look both ways. No car lights to be scene, than I pull a death defying stunt monivuer in the middle of Maple, with the utmost precision... Tom Cruise would've been proud... Needless to say I had to find some shelter, drive to civilization and park and enter The Tavern, a sports pub somewhere downtown... Nice, needed a shiner bock! Hot girls to look at too.  Having finished my brew, I then proceed to drive back to the Ft. Worth area... But, wait, The sky is going nuts! It's like I'm at the science place and my fingers are guiding the static electricity ball... It was awesome! So, what next? Well, I call a girl that happened to be living in between where I was and where I was going, not formally asking to come see her, but she asked me to stop by, Score! Nothing better than making the whoopee in an awesome electrical storm!!!!  My story started with the audition, which went well... The story will end with me saying that I got the role in the play!!! Not bad for one night... Everything wrapped up in one day... Excitement, Nervousness, daring Stunts, alcohol, Sweet Visions, SEX! More Sweet Visions... More to come Travel is in the future

      Well here i sit...it's too late and I've had far too much wine.  I'm blasting myself to the past and listening to old Dylan songs. [Bootleg Series] Bob Dylan, one of the greatest song writers of all time.  Holy Crap!  It makes me laugh, cry, want, wish, standing at a cross roads in my life; hoping for a rocket ship off this rock.  Maybe it will happen for the better...if not then i think that it will certainly happen for the worse.  I watched GATTACA tonight...it's depressing to think of what my grand-kids (assuming I have kids & they have kids) have to look forward to.  No one can say for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's not far off the mark.    RACISM - a joke.  A more appropriate description in our age would be CLASSISM.  No one cares what color your skin is if your rich...it's more about money than color...it always has been and it always will be.  The Capitalist Machine is UNSTOPPABLE...there will never be the greatest good for the greatest number, but instead the greatest good for the elite few.  The rest will be repressed...it's always been that way and it shall remain so...freedom is an illusion. However, I'm not saying that  is wrong, bad, or evil - it's just the way it is; who am I to judge.  Evolution is such.  Praise the machines that we will become, and their ancestors.  Imagine 1 million years into the future. -IMPOSSIBLE - you can't possibly imagine what life will be like then.  A total transformation...an evolution.  Ashes to Ashes = everything you see before you will someday be dust.  Nothing can stand the stand the test of  time "Every tower ever built tumbles - no matter how strong, no matter how tall...Someday even man's best laid plans will lie twisted and covered in rust"... Mr. Steve Earle croons.  SO true Mr. steve...soo true.   Anyway, enough of this...what happened to Dylan...the once great political optimist...freedom fighter...voice of the people...well he saw the truth, and it wasn't the utopia that he'd hoped for.  He said, "Fuck It" - you can hear his sentiments echoed in his more recent works - "I used to care, but things have changed" - he finally saw the futility in the fight...the utter failure that is man.  We will be gone someday...replaced by a more efficient, more calculating, more advanced, less emotional creature than ourselves.  For emotion is the essence of man.  You will never see a cyborg enraged with jealousy.  In conclusion, I will leave you with THE HANGDOGS - one of the greatest of the modern freedom fighters, and a few of the few who can lift the vail of deception. Songs: -The world is yours -Something left to save -Early to Bed -Memo from the Head Office -Hey, Janeane -Monopoly on the Blues  P.S.  Triscuits dipped in Chianti ='s YUM.

      Started on Friday afternoon really... my buddies and I headed down to Austin for some good ol fashioned drinking and tubing.  Well, some of my buddies.  Apparently the group of 10-15 that was advertised by the organizer was slowly whittled down to 5, 3 in my car and 2 meeting us later on 6th street...  If that wasn't enough, I was also informed that some other guys were heading to Arkansas for canoeing and ... other stuff... hehehe.  I haven't decided how open I'm being on this yet.  For now, "other stuff" will have to do.  Needless to say, I would've rather canooed the Buffalo.  So we head out of Dallas around 3 PM.  Beat the traffic!  Wooo-hoooooooooo!  Just before leaving we'd been informed of a huge biker rally in Austin happening this weekend.  Sounded interesting, except for the fact that we had no hotel room at this point.  We file this under "something to worry about later when drunk."    I had my first drink about halfway into the drive.  Captain Morgan and Dr. Pepper, nice.  Of course I was already stoned... very stoned...   We make it to Austin by about 6:00 or so.  We're on 6th street.  Bikes lining the streets.  Police already out in force.  We go into some bars.  I think we have a flaming Dr. Pepper somewhere, which was good but disappointing.  Apparently some jerk-offs got burned during a flaming Dr. Pepper performance and ruined everyone elses fun.  When you know the bartender is going to be blowing flame, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY!    And then our other 2 friends arrive.  Well, one is our friend, we'll call him "Dillhole", and the other is his friend.  They meet up with us and we really begin to drink.  HA!  We're already drunk.  Some time passes and our friend Dillhole has to go.  Turns out he's already paid for a Condo with his other friends who are in town to watch the college world series, they obviously need a life.  But anyways, he has to leave his friend with us.  His other friends decided no one they didn't know could stay at the condo with them... assholes.  So Dillhole has to leave his friend with us.  Luckily one of my Austin buddies had offered his place for us, so we actually do have a place to stay which is nice.  So at this point, we stumble back towards my car to drop off our new buddy's bag.  Stumbling down 6th street is fuuuuuuun!  Until a fucking monsoon hits!  We're stumbling along, minding our own business, when PLOP!  Huge rain drop lands next to us.  We look up.  Uh-oh.  PLOP! PLOP PLOP!  PLOP PLOP PLOP!  WHAM!  Full-fledged monsoon.  We duck as much as we can under an awning, but there's already a bunch of other drunks under there too.  So we decide that since we are so cool, that we'll just keep running towards the car staying as dry as we can, which of course is completely fucking sopping wet.  Oh well, it felt good.  Luckily for my car, it's in a parking garage.  I say for my car because in the condition we were in, we might have decided it was a good idea to open the fucking sunroof or something.  At the car, beer drinking, smoking, football and frisbee ensue.  We still had a cooler in my car from the drive and we decided to just turn on the car radio and play some football and frisbee in the parking garage.  It's probably good some of the others bailed on the trip, if they'd have been there a full fledged contact football game may have broken out and it's gauranteed someone would've gotten broken.    We tire of this after a beer or 2 and decide to go.  Problem.  Car doesn't start.  Apparently having the radio on and doors open drained the battery a bit.  Ooops.  Luckily I have cables.  Let's ask this couple leaving right now if they can give us a jump.  Fucking bitch says NO!!!  Can you believe it?  WTF?  How the fuck do you say no?  Apparently she thinks we need to take better care of our car.  What a fucking slut.  Of course she's driving and her pussy little boyfriend says nothing.    Oh well, we'll file this under "worry about it later" too, it seemed to work out OK last time.  Time for some PIZZA!!  If you've never had pizza on 6th street after a night of drinking you haven't lived yet.  DAMN THAT SHIT IS GOOD!  So we head that way.  I should mention of course that I'm barefoot and shirtless.  My shirt was soaked from the rain and my shoes for some reason got left in the car.  It made sense at the time dammit.  I wasn't the only shoeless one though.    Stumbling back down 6th street was fun, the rain had stopped and it felt great out.  For some reason we decided to go into a bar, pizza was forgotten.  No idea why.  But I have no shirt!  So our new pal decides to go and buy me one.  Fucker comes back laughing and holding the fucking childs shirt or something.  It was small.  Way too small.  And it said in red, white and blue letters "TEXAS MUSIC KICKS ASS".  I shit you not.  I wear this 2 sizes too small gay ass texas music shirt into this bar and I'm barefoot.  I must have looked a sight.  The beer was good though.  The bathroom wasn't.  That's right, I had to piss.  No shoes.  Disgusting floor.  Didn't seem to bother me at the time though.  I'm a soccer player, I have tough feet.  Besides, germs really make you stronger, it's those fucking capitalist drug and soap companies that wanna make you think every germ is gonna kill you so you buy their shit.  Fuck that.  I'm a man.  Sometimes a stupid man, but a man nonetheless.  I'm pretty sure last call came and went and we had to leave the bar.  Luckily, back at the car, we convince some nice locals to jump our car.  Works wonderfully.  We manage to find our way to my friends apartment complex where we laid down on the sidewalk waiting for them to get home.  Which they apparently already were.  We were laying in the wrong hallway.  Ooops.  They all looked the same to me.  We finally pass out on my friends floor, but not before piling shit on top of the first to pass out.  That's always fun.  We made sure to take pictures of him with his cell phone too.  Good times.  Good times.  So that's just Friday night, we'll have to recap Saturday and the wonderful float down the river tomorrow.  Good day.

      Well, after reading blog after blog, day after day, I've decided to start one of my own.  I don't expect anyone to read it, but that's not the point anyways.  Or is it?  Who knows.  As of now, I'm just doing this to pass the time at work!  MuuWhahahahahaha!  Edit: Apparently there is a timestamp issue.  Although this is the first post, it was apparently submitted through a time-space continuum into the future.  Odd.

      If there's one thing my wife always tells me, it's to relax while driving.  It seems she doesn't enjoy the way I release my anger by venting at the retards out there on the road.  She'd prefer me to hold it all inside... hold it.. hold it.. hold it. EXPLODE!  That's no good.  That's how fuckers get shot.  Or ran off the road.  Or whatever.    I prefer to release it as it comes up.  Some asshole cuts me off, I yap at him.  He can't hear me.  He probably doesn't even know I'm talking to him.  So fuck him.  Bastard.    That really doesn't happen to me too much though, I'm the speedy guy.  I don't really get passed.  But what does annoy me are those people who don't seem to comprehend that the left lane is for passing.  WTF?  Do they not teach that anymore in drivers ed?  Can people not read the big white signs that say "Left Lane for Passing Only"?  Or are they just self-absorded jerk-offs?  Doesn't really matter.  Either way it annoys me to no end.  If you are going the 5 mph over the speed limit or less, GET OVER!  Think of it as a good way to stay awake.  You pass someone, then when clear get back over right.  Rinse and repeat.  Not a hard concept.  Yet...  I've tried going around on the right, then cutting back left in front of them, not cutting them off, just getting over.  Then I'll turn on my right hand turn signal and get over.  Sometimes that works.  Sometimes I'll just signal with my hand, either out the window, through the sunroof, or in the car, for them to get right.  Sometimes that works.  I'm still deciding whether to buy a huge neon sign that I can turn on reading "Get over Asshole!"  The other pet peeve of mine is people who don't wave.  I'm a nice driver.  I allow people in when merging.  I'll even slow down to let some asshole who didn't realize he needed to exit to cut accross for lanes to get off.  But rarely do I get a wave of thanks.  Well fuck that.  If I'm being a nice, considerate driver to you, you better fucking give me the courtesy of doing it back.  Truckers I exclude from this group.  They are usually very considerate and will flash their brake lights at me if I let them over.  Keep on truckin.  That's the end of my rant for now, and you know what, I FEEL BETTER!

      I am annoyed with work.  I hate the  INSTABILITY  of my job.  It's fucking annoying...It's like I can make a shitload of $$, then the Sparkling Fairy of Suck My Balls comes along and sprinkles a bag full of fairy crap in my mouth, and I'm left with nothing buy annoyance. :\  - Oh well at least I have a job..my motto is...it could always be worse.  Well, it's not really a "motto", but I have thought that before.   Anyway, enough of that...How was your day?  Probably going to float the river this weekend.  Excited to see the hot girls; not so excited that I will not be able to partake in the Essence of Antioch!!  DAmNit!!! - There.  I have vented...This blog BS isn't so bad after all.  Remember kids...NOTHING FAILS LIKE PRAYER.  pEaCe.

      So, it has been awhile since my last entry, but i have one now... So, i was on my way to my second job this past Friday evening and&nbsp;while driving on 183 going east right across from the nasty looking, needs to be demolished Texas Stadium, were my boy Roy Williams plays safety, go OU! anyways traffic is going at speed or faster, probably faster, knowing these crazy redneck truck driving or excursion driving maniacs that are everywhere you turn around here in big D... To continue, 183 is a 3 lane highway, and I changed lanes to the center lane, which if you know me is the perfect lane to dodge all these Big D maniacs, because you can go either left or right to avoid any confrontations&nbsp;right? Right. okay except this time for me it didn't turn out that way.... Hmmmm for some reason the chick infront of me decided to park here car, i guess&nbsp;to look at the awesome Texas Stadium, again were Roy Williams plays safty, maybe she was in hopes of catching a glimps of the terrific player or some shit, dumb shit! NO you are supposed to&nbsp;DRIVE on the highway! UGGGGhhhh.... So, i slammed on the breaks trying to avoid a really bad hit, which i did, not much damage done to the front of my vehicle, UNTIL! i got smacked seriously hard from the Mexican&nbsp;Maxima that was behind me, knocking me a second time into the car infront of me... Shit guys this really hurt! So, i look over my shoulder as I'm drifting into the right lane of traffic and see one of these hugh excursion monsters bareing down on me, oh man, they didn't hit me but if they did, i would not be writing this tonight... Really lucky! So, we pulled over to the side of the road and i got the insurance info from the Mexican that hit me, they actually had some! and they needed it, because their car was jacked up! But the bitch that i hit didn't have it on her, well, i asked for it and she pulled out her AAA card... "No doll, that's not it..." I said, So she then&nbsp;pulls out her medical insurance card, "UMMM, no that would be your med insurance card, which you might need after i kick your ass, after this and before the police show up" ok i really didn't say that last part, but&nbsp;REALLY wanted to... Cops came got our info, sent me on my way, which was cool, cause i was running really late for the show, in which i had the best performance i've had to date, really amazing how that worked out, but it did... So the car is drivable I'm still a bit sore, couldn't go to the pool fiesta, sorry captain... But i am getting a pretty big check from my insurance company, and the car really isn't in that bad of shape, Sweet, looks like I'll be getting my hog soon! &nbsp;Oh, just a footnote to the chicks that i hit, they were pretty upset, and i have a feeling that they had some sort of drugs in there vehicle, because the passanger jumped in another car that they were following apparently, and left the scene of the accident, hmmmm kinda fishy, if you ask me. moral of the story, don't ever turn to look at Texas Stadium when your driving. A, your not missing anything if you don't look at it,&nbsp;except maybe getting in a car accident. B, you can't see Eddie George, I think all the Cowboys are in Cali. right now. and C, it is the ugliest piece of shit stadium in the whole NFL, and the Cowboys should move to Arlington!

      Austin, Texas – Self proclaimed live music capital of the World, and one of the coolest cities on the face of the planet. Austin’s the kind of city that fights the corporate giants like Wal-Mart & Costco to keep their generic, small town usurping, culture killing, buy cheap crap here stores OUT of the city limits. It’s a city that works to maintain its culture of weirdness, and the city’s slogan “Keep Austin Weird” is upheld with pride by the locals.  Last night I was watching The Breakfast Club, with Arabian subtitles, and I stumbled upon today’s topic. In TBC Anthony Michael Hall is the self proclaimed "King of the Dorks". “Who would want to be King of the Dorks”, you ask. Simple, if you’re already a dork you might as well be the best dork that you can be. Be the King of Dorks. This morning I was clicking through the photos of my time in Austin, and I noticed some interesting parallels between Anthony Michael Hall, and a relatively famous Austinite.  His name is "Leslie"! I'm not sure if he has a last name, but for now we'll just call him “King Leslie”. King Leslie was born in 1956, and he was in his prime when the 70’s hit [Insert VH1 Behind the Music rise and fall scenario here]. Leslie survived the 70’s, and ended up in Austin. Homeless &amp; struggling to survive, Leslie began his ascent to Kingship.  Early on Leslie realized that to be successful you must find a niche. The King found his in G-strings and Women’s clothing. He began prancing around town personifying the Weirdness of Austin. This prancing eventually lead him to seek public office. Last year Leslie ran for mayor (again), and received over 3000 votes. King Leslie can be seen mainly on Congress, 6th street, or at any of the many festivals that Austin host. He's usually clad in his traditional G-String garb, and carries a "Shorong" (or whatever the term is for that thing that women wrap around them @ the beach) so that he can enter bars and have people buy him drinks. Yes, people buy him drinks, and he takes them. If you take your picture with him he expects $$ or drinks. Yes, he's a drunk. Yes, he's homeless, but he's the King of all the Drunk & Homeless, and that has to count for something. Whatever your opinion of the Homeless, he’s certainly doing his part to KEEP AUSTIN WEIRD. Here are some personal pics &amp; links if you wish to learn more about the great King Leslie of Austin.  CAUTION: Critics may think that the pics below are exploitive or sad, but I’ve met King Leslie several times, and you can see in his eyes that he prides himself in being the King of the Homeless. Besides, as Mel taught us long ago, IT’S GOOD TO BE THE KING.  Here’s Leslie @ the 2003 Austin City Limits Festival with my friend Leigh Ann:     King Leslie protesting after being arrested:     Links:  urlLink http://austintexas420.tripod.com/leslie-cochran/pictures.html   urlLink http://www.txtriangle.com/archive/845/coverstory.htm   urlLink http://www.austinmayor.com/   So, if you are ever in Austin, and you happen to see King Leslie, give him the respect that a King deserves. All hail King Leslie.  P.S. – Tom Petty Rocks. Seriously. He’s pretty much the “coolest” guy ever. Can anyone name anyone cooler? Maybe Frank Sinatra?  P.P.S. – 4 post in a row = I RULE THIS BLOG. = (You all suck for not posting!)  P.P.P.S. - “The Captain” has apparently abandoned ship. What has become of our fearless leader? Has his lack of transportation encumbered his writing abilities? Is he lost on the Isle of Man (or Girly-man)? Is he just wasted? Where have you gone El Capitan? [Insert Mexican accent] Viva El Cap-i-tan!!!

          Obviously I AM MASTER OF THIS BLOG. I have 3 posts in a row, and rule the Known Universe...Muwhahahahahahaha. Ok ok…I don’t really rule the Universe. I just work here. Anyways, today I would like to revisit a topic that I once thoroughly sorted out, only to find upon publishing that I’d been thwarted by the Gods of premature page logout. I curse them, but I will not give up in my attempt to explain to the World my devious plan to build a Pomeranian Farm. First, let us layout the basic steps for the farm building.  1) Buy some land. 2) Build a fence. 3) Put a bunch of Pomeranians inside fence. 4) Profit.  Simple enough. Ok, I shall go into more detail. Luckily I'm getting paid to explain my life's dream to the world, and so I’ll try and be as through as possible so as not to let my employer down.  As stated above, I will first buy some land (~50 Acres). Rolling hills are preferred, but not necessary. I will then pay some migrant workers, primarily from Botswana and Oman, to erect a game proof fence around my acreage. It's imperative that I rid the fenced acreage of all natural predators (i.e. Foxes, Coyotes, Bears, Buffalo, and Salamanders). Once the area is clear, my crew of migrant laborers and I will dig three small burrows (aka: Dens) in three hillsides spaced ~500 yards apart.  Next, I will release the migrant workers to their countries of origin, and hire some techies (probably ex-MIT folk that quit b/c their Baby’s Momma sued them over backed child support and forced them into contract labor working on Pomeranian Farms). Anyways, the techies and I will set up an elaborate closed circuit camera system throughout the ~50 acres of hilly terrain. Including, but not limited to, extensive coverage of all 3 denning areas. Our next step will be the most critical, finding the Pomeranian stock.  For those of you who are not familiar with Pomeranians allow me to educate you. A true Spitz breed in miniature, the Pomeranian is the smallest member of that family of northern breeds. But that wasn't always the case. The original Pomeranian weighed up to 30 lb (13.5 kg), and was a vicious killer. When the breed was imported to Britain during the reign of Queen Victoria, Her Majesty took an interest in the Poms but preferred a smaller dog weighing 12-18 lb (5.5-8 kg). British breeders took up the challenge and succeeded in reducing the breed even further in size, producing dogs 3-7 lb (1.5-4 kg). Though, these “breeders” succeeded in reducing the size of the Pomeranian, they could not breed out the ferociousness of this aggressive wolf-like death monger. They had essentially bred a pint sized killing machine. I have extensive personal experience with this breed, and I can tell you first hand that these fur-balls are vicious, and should not be handled under any circumstances. They fear nothing, and will attack at the slightest provocation. Fortunately, the completion of my plan relies upon the ferocity of this voracious breed. I will scour the countryside searching for the most aggressive Pomeranians imaginable. Once, I have obtained approximately ~100 of the furry little devils I will release them into the Pomeranian Kingdom. This is where my plan comes together. As the Poms become accustomed to “Pomstralia” (as I like to call it), the closed circuit camera system will pick up all of the intense drama soon to unfold.  Be Afraid Be Very Afraid:        The ~100 furry merchants of death will break up into packs. There will, of course, be fighting to establish an Alpha Male, there will be challenges, and there will be more fighting. Some will die, some will live, some will attempt to dig under the game proof fence and attempt to flee Pomstralia, but there is no escape. The evolutionary processes laid down by the creator have been set in motion. The closed circuit cameras will document the once domesticated beast transformation into a more deadly mongrel, the Feral Pomeranian. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term feral: A feral animal is one that has escaped from domestication and returned, partly, or wholly, to its wild state. It is usually reserved for Pigs, Horses, and larger dog breeds, but Pomstralia’s protected environment will allow the Pom to rule the top of the food chain.  What “food chain” you ask. Well, what is the use of a pack formation if there is nothing for the miniature wolves packs to compete for? For the sake of the evolutionary process it is now necessary to stop feeding the packs, and introduce the first stage of the hunting process, the furry bunnies and baby chickens. After, a few days of starvation the packs will grow weary, and look to their Alpha males for leadership. Their wolf-like intuition will take hold; they will form hunting parties, and roam the country side in search of the bunnies and baby chickens. Their techniques will develop, and the most successful of the packs will thrive. Over time the offspring of the most successful survivors will certainly alter the traditional appearance of the Poms. Their incisors will grow to flesh tearing lengths, and their claws will sharpen into scythe-like utensils of death. The massacres will of course be gruesome, but it’s a known fact that gruesomeness sells. This is where the profit comes in.  As the closed circuit cameras pick up all the drama and trauma, our editors, comprised mainly of Mexican Nationals from the former Mexican Province of California, will document the rise and fall of different groups of Wild Poms. The style of documentation is flexible, it may be done in a professional “nature show” manner, personifying the beast, and telling the heroic story of a few selected Poms and their personal adventure in evolution. It could also be edited in a more dramatic overblown Fox TV Reality Nature Massacre Festival sort of way. Regardless of how the great story of the Pomeranians ascent to predatory dominance is told, the point is that it is all for Science. The Pomstralia Experiment will provide yet another proof of the evolutionary process. The entire spectacle will serve as a crowing achievement for Nature Cinematography and Natural Selection alike. Plus, we will be able to sell the Poms overgrown incisors on E-Bay for $10 each.  So, next time you see something as cute as the furriness below. Remember, a few years of selective breeding and evolution, and you might be their next victim. Pomeranians, with thier beady little eyes and raptor like jaws of painful death +19. Can you really afford to "love your Pomeranian"?

      It seems as if this blog...like so many before it...has died :( The eternal optimism that comes with the beginning of a blog-like substance, alas, has faded. I sit in front of a keyboard typing my innermost everything, but there are none to read or to respond. Utterly alone in the desert. It's unfortunate that so many know of this thread and are reading this right now thinking:      Well I must tell you all that I feel the same. I have no idea why I ramble on so. Lalala. Ok, over and out. Peace be to all under the name of all the annoying Gods, buddas, and Allahs. JMZ
