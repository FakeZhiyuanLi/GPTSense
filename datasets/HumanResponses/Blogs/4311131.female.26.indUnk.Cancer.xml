      Not a good day for me. :( Somehow, I lost my balance, and fell. I have been going into spasms, again. We think it's my medication that I am on. I made me an appointment to see my doctor on Friday. Been getting these horrid headaches again. And everything else hurts. I tell ya, I am just falling apart here. :(     And to top it all off, my computer had 18 viruses! YIKES! Now, I am backing everything up. And then my dad is going reinstall windows, and going to start from scratch. Again.  I am mostly backing up what is most important to me. Like my poetry, Sims, and ect. Speaking of Sims, Sims 2 is coming out next month. :) I am getting it. :) I also have a website, http://shans-sims.cjb.net I have started creating objects for the game. :) It's so much fun. :)   Ok, going to go. I just wish this stupid headache will go away! :(  sigh .....    Later..

      Well, I decided to create a blog. :) I had written a post, but my stupid internet went out on me, and then I accidently pushed the wrong button, and clicked out of it. :(   I hate it when that happens. I guess I will post about what's going on in my life, and share my poetry with you all. :) Speaking of poetry, I just written one a few minites ago. Well, it's a re write of the one that I already have written. It's on my poetry site, http://from-the-heart.cjb.net I am changing the name from From The Heart, to "Flying With Wings". I am also looking for a decent publishing company to publish my poetry. I have been wanting to publish my poetry since I started writing poetry. :)  Anyway, here is the poem. Let me know what you think. :) ==  Title: "Fly Away" Author: Shannon Louisa S. Website: http://from-the-heart.cjb.net (C) 2004 ==  Fly away  From here To a better day  Fly away  From all the grief From all the pain  Go on You can do it Go on and fly  Just go ahead And try   Listen to what  Is being said Fly into the rain  Let it wash away  All the pain   Don't cry Dry your tears Calm your fears Spread your wings It's not as bad  As it seems Close your eyes  It will be all right Just fly Fly Into the light  Doesn't matter  How it seems Doesn't matter How bad Go on  Go on and fly Fly to your dreams  Don't be afraid I'll be there Lending a hand Ready to care Wanting to understand  Believe I know you can I'll show you how How to mend your wings So you can fly Fly To your dreams  Fly away  From here Things will be better From now on Trust me You'll be strong You'll see  Forget your sorrows Forget today Look on To tomorrow And fly Fly  Fly away  No longer Do I weep For I lay my head Down to sleep No longer Do I cry For now, I can fly  ===   Ok, going to go now. Later! :)
