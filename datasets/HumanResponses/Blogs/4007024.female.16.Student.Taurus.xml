      today was such a lonnnggg day. i didn't get to bed till very late listening to my little brother and his friend being the typical drunks. then i had to get up kind of early to go none other than SCHOOL SUPPLY SHOPPING! dude that's like my favorite preparing for school task ever. you get all kinds of new things and it's just awesome. i got this really sweet organizer--yeah it's badass. so now i'm going to be a very organized kid this school year.. well i always am. but now i don't have to write everything in those shitty school planners. and just got a bunch of other neat and fun things from the local office depot. breezy accompanied me and she got a bunch of cool stuff too. we just had a ball. oh yeah and bree locked her car with the keys in the ignition AGAIN. this is the 2nd time she's done it while being around me. so the office depot guy had to help us.. then this other guy was like i got this.. and he did it in like 2 mins. we were like i mean shit have you had some practice. i mean gees.  but that was about the funnest part of my day.. other than that is was pretty shitty. i almost got in about 3 wrecks or something like that. and there was soo many people at the gas station so it took forever to finally get a spot to pump gas and when i finally do i get out and my door slams into those shitty red poles that are always around the gas pumps... so i go to another pump that gets free ( i didn't have room to get out at the other one ) and this car is in front of me and isn't pulled up very far and i get out and the gas pumper thing doesn't reach... and this person isn't even pumping gas they are inside the store so finally the bitch moves and i get to pump my gas. then the ryan st. traffic just doesn't put you in a very good mood. (( not to mention carla cancels the trip to galveston tomorrow b/c of judsons dumb ass caught drinking last night.. yeah nothing gets past my mom.. )) so i finally get home and mom wants to cry when she looks at the reciet from office depot.. so i have to go return a few things that she said she could get free from her work and there was no sense in me buying them. so i get bitched out.. and now i have to go BACK to office depot and return some stuff..  then i went to books-a-million and of course they don't have the book i have to read for AP Am. history so i have to go to the mall and see if walden books has it.. yay they had one left and i bought the bitch.. b/c yeah it's pretty big and i have to read it! fyi i finished my last english book! woohoo.. (( kim pats herself on the back)). now i just have to finish the 3 papers i have left for that class.. then read the killer angels ( am. hist. ) and write the paper on that. yay i'm almost done... uhh kind of?  tonight i didn't do much.. hunter called and asked if i wanted to go hang out at ramseys.. so i went. and i won 5 times in a row at pool!!! woohoo i'm the champion. well i mean the only reason i won is b/c they either scratched when hitting the 8 ball in or hitting the 8 ball in too early.. but hey winning is winning no matter how you won :o) so yeah i'm saying that i'm the champ at pool even though i'm not that good!! lol so i was pretty freaking excited.  oh yeah i found out i have to get my wisdom teeth out not this coming monday but the next ( aug. 9 ) :-/ yeah my cheeks are already HUGE now they are going to be soo abnormal.. yikes! so i'm going to be drugged up for like 4 days.. so that puts 4 days off my working schedule for the summer assignments.. so i'm having to make up for that by cramming more in a day then i normally would.. being the procrastinator i am. oh yeah and not to mention mandey told me the reason harrahs hasn't called me yet is b/c the next interview isn't till not this tues but next.. so uhh yeah i have to go interview drugged up b/c the next one isn't till next month ( sept ) and i definately need a job before then. the people are going to be like holy shit this girl's cheeks are huge. but hey maybe i'll get bonus points for going after having surgery-- thinking i'm a determined girl or something. ;-) but that's if i'm not in bed passed out.  bed time.. i have to wake up and go work out ( yeah dude i'm going work out.. it's a freaking miracle or something. ) and plus i have soo much shit to do tomorrow so i need to get an early start ;-) ( that's another miracle.. kim getting up before noon or 1pm! ) make a document of this shit. later.

       hey hey! i'm freaking up and running early today.. kayla woke my ass up this morning to go make deliveries with her because we stayed at cousin jamie's last night. :o) we always have fun fun times on those.. we're just stupid together. i think everyone needs one of those friends who you can just act the fool with.&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;   annyyywwhoo! i completed one essay..! yay!&nbsp;i went to zacs and we hung out and wrote our essays. thanks zac you're the best :-) 1 down 4 to go... AHHH! i'm going to crack down this week and weekend though... so watch out ;-)     &nbsp;   dude school is sooner than i thought.. but i'm totally excited for junoir year.. i think it's going to be GREAT! it will be freaking awesome if all our junoir girls could get along instead of being split up into 2 groups which is freaking retarded. and it's not cool when people talk about you for doing something and then they turn around and do it. damn hypocrites. (( dude i totally just had teretts just now.. b/c that anger just came out)) i just want everyone to get along and hang out with everyone and stop being selfish. that's just what i think. :-D     &nbsp;   i think i'm going to visit kevin carter in lafayette tomorrow woohoo! he's my buddy.. i haven't hung out with him in forever and i'm excited. and we&nbsp;might go hang out with my friend christi from there.. she's cool as shit. and i haven't seen her in AGES!     &nbsp;   nap time... later.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      i think i'm sick.. which is totally not cool. i'm all congested and my nose is stopped up and i sound like i'm crying when i talk to people on the phone haha. IT SUCKS. i lay in bed all day because i feel like complete shitttttttt.  update on the paper: i'm moving along.. slowly but surely. :-/ oh and i'm almost done reading a lesson before dying. i must say, it is way better than the great gatsby. that was probably the most awful book i've EVER read. --no offense if you enjoyed it.   i went to lafayette yesterday with the family ( yes i know, shoot me ) but i needed to get clothes.. brennan ( my 12 yr. old step brother ) annoyed me the whole way up there and i wanted to wreck the car on his side just to shut his ass up. :-) ( i'm evil, yes i know ). then my mom was in a bitchy mood b/c brennan was getting on her last nerve so she only wanted to get stuff i can wear to school.. ( so yes, another reason why i wanted to beat his ass ). so much for the great shopping trip i was planning.   last night i watched cruel intentions 3 and it was a good movie.. ( if you like twisted, fucked up, sex movies. ) but it turned out to be pretty good. kayla said it was good so i rented it b/c there isn't shit to rent at blockbuster ( either one ) and i'm just getting very upset with them lately.&nbsp;b/c yes i go there almost every night because all i do is sit at home. :-) i'm just such a party animal.. can't you tell?   well seeing that i really have nothing else to talk about since my life is so damn boring. i'm leaving to go to kaylas. laterrr   &nbsp;

       so yeah i'm just sitting at home on a friday night.. i'm thinking that i'm not going to do anything so i make a trip to the local blockbuster and rent some movies. get this shit-- i ask the girl that works there ( who's carrying a huge ass stack of movies ) if they had any confessions of a teenage drama queen ( i'm a total loser.. i know i know ) and she's all no.. so i pick 2 other movies and i'm at the counter and this&nbsp;old guy&nbsp;with his like 5 year old daughter is in front of me and askes if they have it.. and the same girl goes yeah we just got one. okay bitch.. why wouldn't you tell me knowing that i had already asked for it? and i totally wanted to be like dude you daughter won't even understand the movie seeing that she is like 2 or something. ( okay 5 but still ) and what the hell would he get out of the movie? uhh nothing. that's what i thought. isn't that freaking ridiculous.. something to totally ruin your night.     &nbsp;  yeah i'm sitting at home watching one of the movies i rented and breezy is all like do you want to go hang out with ramsey and hunter with me... yeah sure. i didn't have anything else to do and it would be fun to just actually hang out and shoot the shit then go to a party ( which is definately getting old&nbsp;) so she comes to get me.. and we go to the sulphur blockbuster to see if they have confessions of a teenage drama queen ( yes once more i'm&nbsp;a LOSER ) so we walk in and the guys that work there were like heyyyy and we both were all like hi and they just started busting out laughing and we were like what? but then we realized how that hi was totally nsync and sounded as though we rehearsed it or something. they dont have it so we move our business to hollywood ( on the way to hollywood.. these 2 40 year old grungy guys honk and are like waving at me and breezy--which personally made me want to vomit) well hollywood didn't have it either so we gave up on our quest and just went to ramseys. we take a journey on the motorcycles which was a lot of fun ( i've never been on one before ) that's something i definately want to do again. i rode first with ramsey and he probably thinks i'm the weirdest kid on the planet b/c i had that starbuck double shot commercial stuck in my head.. which is the rocky theme song.. but it's all like ROY, ROY ROY ROY and then they said i look like the person off space balls b/c i had on the helmet and they said it's a tiny body with a huge ass helmet or something... i haven't seen that movie in like 6 years so i had no idea what they were talking about... :-/&nbsp; then i rode with hunter and we went 100.. and i was all saying pussy go faster and stuff and he was just busting out laughing. then we were all hanging out at ramseys and ramsey beat my ass in pool then it was time to go home...    &nbsp;  i spent the night at breezys and we were all playing with little ricky ( her dog ) which is a total bitch and doesn't ever play with me it just barks at me. but he was being a sweetheart and hanging out with us. ooh but he passed gas in breezys face and it was freaking hilarious and we were rolling on the ground laughing. then we went on an adventure to walmart at like 3:30am.. to get hot oil treatments for our hair--we are such females, i know. actually breezy is.. she talked me into it. we went back to her house and she did her hot oil treatment but i passed and i just read a magazine then went to bed. what a crazy night.

        have you ever felt like everyone is out to get you and is trying to ruin your   happiness? well that's how i feel right now. i mean honestly... no1 even noticed me whenever i was the unhappy kid. okay dude if i want to do something.. i mean shit let me do it. who cares if he is your best friends ex boyfriend... he's my ex boyfriend too. and that is no reason to not like me&nbsp;or not let me&nbsp;hang out with him. shit.  okay... i'm through bitching.  &nbsp;   but really i just want everyone to mind their own business... and just not care about what others are doing and just worry about themselves. the world would be so much better that way. and really.. you know what bothers me the most.. when people talk down to me. but then again who likes it. age doesn't matter one bit and people need to realize that.. we are ALL EQUAL. but most ignorant people do not realize that.   &nbsp;  i think it's hilarious because everyone thinks they understand me when they really don't. so i think you all should just give up.. you are wasting your time. i'm thinking i want to go live with my friend collin for the remainder of the summer just to get away from this place... dude that would be freaking awesome. i love collin and his family and i would love to stay with them for the rest of the summer.. and learn to surf--uhh hell yes. i'm just hoping carla jo will say yes... hm i don't know what she will say though. :-/  &nbsp;  i need to go back to writing my god damn paper.. doesn't it suck. later.     &nbsp;

       hey everyone!    yeah my name is Kim.. uhh i don't know what else to say about myself. there's this little problem i have.. which i noticed today. i've always noticed it.. but it's never been quite this bad. procrastination... uh. i seem to do everything for everyone else.. but yet do nothing for myself whenever i have things that need to be completed. i guess i enjoy doing things for others.. but nothing for myself :-/. this has to be a serious problem. i have 3 novels to read and 5 papers to write that are due on the first day of school. eww i know. let's recap on how much kim has finished... 1/2 a paper, 1 book, and half another book. school is not too far away.. so basically i'm screwed unless i get whatever is stuck out my ass out. my cat is being a total nuisance... i'm about to beat her ass. please hold.&nbsp;that ho was rubbing all over me!! did i mention i'm like deathly allergic to cats? oh but yes.. i am. and we have one... isn't that odd? it might just be me. by the way dude lake charles is HORRIBLE.. please someone kidnap me and take me away from here. me and my friend paul were discussing today that i totally do not belong here... and he imagines i'm going to move far away when i get out of high school.. and man is he right? hell yes he is. school is going to be totally weird whenever it starts... i'm glad our senoirs are gone though--well some of them. i still miss the guys that graduated 2 years ago.. how pathetic? my whole group of friends can definately agree on that one. but being a junoir.. weird shit. but graduated in 2 years... i can't wait. and i'm hoping those 2 years go by fast. i'm ready for college ho! oh god my brother just bribed me into bringing him halfway to jennings tomorrow.. dang it. like i don't have anything else better to do. i went to apply at harrahs today :o) i'm excited.. i'm going for an interview either tomorrow or the next day. mandey and april work there! YAY! good times.. good times. and if i get the job i'll work under either mandeys uncle or mom. 2 cool ass people. i just need some money.. carla jo is boycotting the money. no good. i'm going to go attempt to write my paper. :-/ later.

      dude i have a fantastic day! here's how it went.....  this morning i had to go to the doctor and on the way there i was totally pysched b/c i thought they were just going to take that medicine stuff out of my holes that they put in last time and i was going to be all better... but i was wrong. they said my holes weren't all the way healed and they had to stick more medicine strips in my holes and i have to go back again monday to get them out! :-( i'm so sad b/c my mouth still hurts and it's been 4 1/2 days already which totally sucks.  after the doctor i had to bring judson to physical therapy ( he just recently got surgery on his knee ) and i didn't know where i was going so my brother was all i'll tell you when to turn on the street blah blah blah. and i was on the phone with my mom at the time telling her what the doctor said and he was like omg you missed the street i was like ugh you didn't tell me and he went off about how if you weren't on the damn phone.. etc. he was just being a total jerk and i pull into a parking lot to turn around and he gets out and he's like i'll walk and slams my door... ( we are in ghetto town by the way ) i was like alright idiot i'm sure. but he finally quit being a whiny bitch and got in the car.  while he is at physical therapy i went to old navy and got a back pack that my mom had to go and get after work so i put it on hold! it's adorable. i like it. then i went back to pick judson up at the place.  around 3:30 i went to nathans and we hung out.. which was a great time. i had so much fun and i'm glad we hung out before he moved. i think i laughed today more than all the days this week combined. yay nate is the coolest. we went to mcdonalds and he got the meal but he didn't eat his fries... weird. and then we went and visited my mom at the cookie bouquet ( picture this.. nathan is in his pj pants the whole time.. haha he had woken up only a little before i went over ) and she bribed me into going make a delivery so we went and did that. and then i got to bring nathan to pick up his car ( yeah her name is christi. ) and he was very excited and then we went back to his house and watched tv being lazy.  i came home took a shower and got ready to go to dags. so i met up with nate and we went to dags...  dags was awesome. both bands were just great. and i was excited i went. the curb was dylan scott jake and jeff ( i think? it's scott's cousin ) and they were really good.. it was my first time ever seeing them. and a lot of people showed up and i was just chattin with everyone having a good time.. and laughed at drunk people dancing. and leda swan played and they were just awesome... it's henry michael chris and some guy i don't know his name.. i've seen them play before and they are just wow. they are very good and i thought they did a great job. i talked to matthew romero and i'm very upset that he is leaving me tomorrow and i must bid him a farewell. dylan actually opened a bottle with my key.. ( he was desperate.. i'm guessing? ) and then he broke my key chain... ( come on my fav. one the martini glass ) but he fixed it. haha good times at dags. i was glad to see everyone.  tomorrow i'm going shopping in baton rouge.. woop woop! me and mom are going on a road trip and we are going to bond and it will be just great. oh yeah and andrew is coming meet up with me.. what a great guy. he's my very good friend from baton rouge that i met july 4th. can't wait can't wait.  mrs. renee is staying the night with my mom tonight.. they are having a slumber party ( how cute right ? ) they are telling the most hilarious stories.. i think my mom misses her best friend. why does she have to live in houston :-( i miss her too. haha but she is moving her son, brett into his apartment in BR and she is staying here for the night. woohoo.. catching up time.  yeah. laterrr dudes.

      sometimes do you feel like you just have too much on your plate at one time? i mean honestly.. i can't handle everything that gets thrown in my way. i don't know how i'm going to make it through this school year with all my school work.. getting a job... and cheerleading. but honestly i'm not going to focus on anything but my school work and if i get yelled at for that they can just shove it up their butts. b/c i have way bigger things to worry about like school.  i'm making progress on my essays... but not as much as i could be if i wasn't drugged up and in extreme amounts of pain. i had to go to the doctor this morning b/c i thought i had dry sockets. but good news is that i don't... but something else is wrong and they had to put some gauze with medicine in my holes and i have to keep it there till tomorrow when i go back at 1pm to have them look at it again. my cheeks have not gone down at all and i have a bruise on my cheek which is very painful. and i hate this so much.  right now all i feel like doing is crying b/c i have all this shit to do but i'm in so much pain and don't feel up to doing or completely anything. i think i've cried like 10 times in the past 3 days. it sucks. and i hate my life right now.  all my friends that came and visited me yall are great and thanks all for bringing me things to make me feel better. :-) it means a lot. and today i think i downloaded like half the OC's old episodes and watched them all day.. b/c that is just the best show and i miss it dearly. but hey it comes back NOVEMBER 4th!! WOOHOO! speaking of i think some more are complete... so i'm going to go watch them and write a paragraph for one of my essays. shoot me damnit.  later. and yes my current mood is CRANKY and complaining little baby. but you would be complaining too if you were me.

       The reason for my title is because today... i kim mccord... found out what a penis is.   For those of you who don't know, penis's belong to boys... and it hangs between your legs.   Speaking of penis's and boys, I need a beer...    A broken clock is right twice a day...   So today i bought an ant farm, and those f***ers didn't grow shit...   So today i waved to a man who had no hands... i felt cocky... like i could've told him "look what i got mother f***er... watch me pick this shit up biatch"...   That is all for now...SCOOBY DOOBY DOO!!!!       haha okay that was ryan the whole time. he's a crazy mofo! him and adam came and visited me for a little while after they lost in poker at trevors. they did a good job amusing me... they were cracking me up and i actually forgot about my pain for a little while--which is good.

      ooh dude i totally forgot to tell you about my day and night on saturday... one of the funnest days.  well me madison catherine and william go out to lunch at nina p's so the oh so cool fallon can be our waitress. haha. so yeah we had fun dining and chatting it up. then me and catherine are like dude let's go play at the park ( b/c we are total 6 yr. olds.. i know ) and so william comes too. we go to millenium park and have a fun time. william spins me and catherine around on the tire swing until we want to throw up or something ( luckily we didn't ) and we just swung on the normal swings for a little while. then we climbed at the top of this tippee thing and chilled up there and just talked. it was like a walk down memory lane. parks are so freaking cool. and i LOVE them. i think the last time i went to a park is with jenny jeff and phil. and that was a lonnnggg time ago. when phil had bleach blonde hair and didn't even know kayla. wow definately a long time ago b/c those two have been dating forever now.  but anyways.. after the park we went to madison's grandma's because madison being the little betty crocker she is baked a blueberry pie ( we all know madison contributed nothing to this pie and her grandmother did all the work.. but hey we can all pretend to make madison smile.) LOL. but the pie was totally awesome and we were just lazy and watched where the heart is while the guys complained b/c we were watching lifetime. i mean shit it's the woman's channel and we want to watch it. oh the other guy that was there was madison's cousin.. if you were wondering where the plural on guys came from. ;-)  so i get a call from judson ( yeah yeah... i'm a freaking taxi cab or something ) and he wants to go sulphur. i'm like okay b/c i figure judson knows where this chick lives. but uhh he thinks he does.. we have to ask directions like 3 times. and i being the unpatient one i am was like going off b/c i was driving around sulphur for like 30mins. and this isn't far into sulphur.. it's just maplewood so just imagine how many times i had to turn around. oh i was fuming.  i come home FINALLY and i'm about to take a nap then madison calls and says to come over so we can go get daquiri's before we go froggin and we are all meeting at her house... so oh course i jump out of the bed..! haha we all chill at mady's having a good time. and then we go froggin... and we didn't catch ANYTHING. the closest i got to a frog is when william put his hand on my leg and i got sewer shit on me.. and i didn't smell too peachy.  then we went to jack's and he was having a few people over so i get out telling people hey and they leave me but i don't care because amanda was there and she wanted me to stay anyways b/c she felt weird being the only barbe person there..and was happy i decided to stay. so i hung out with scott most of them time... and that's my little buddy. he's cool as shit. and amanda disappears so we go to find her.. and then me and amanda are off b/c she has to bring me to my car at madisons.  so that was my night. it was pretty fun and adventurous. :o) but next time i hope i catch a frog. or atleast get the chance to hop into the ditch.. there wasn't much out there.  good times. later.  PS yes i still haven't fallen asleep yet.. and i don't know how i'm not passed the hell out. but i'm going to go attempt to fall asleep... let's hope it works. byebye.

      i made it out alive.. even though it totally sucks. i can't feel my mouth and my tongue. they were flicking me trying to get a vein to pop out and they were making fun of my shoes... how rude. and then they stick the IV in me.. and they were like how you feeling? and i was all like okay... and then things just started getting really dizzy and i don't remember anything. i don't think i totally woke up till sonic where my mom got me a drink.. and i swear i told her ocean water but i ended up with a strawberry limeade.. and i was like mom i said ocean water and she was like no you didn't.. and i guess i just don't remember a thing. and i kept asking her if i talked to morgan b/c morgan was supposed to have an appt. at 4:15 but my mom said she had one earlier... and i think i asked her that like 4 times and she wanted to strangle me. haha. and i went off on my brother for not coming check on me whenever i got home.. but he did.. i just didn't remember. and thanks to all my friends that came and visited me! dom you are the best.. bringing me my favorite smoothie and sharing your pics from NY with me. thanks for keeping me company girl. oh yeah and me and dom are going see princess diaries 2 wed. when it comes out and i'm pumped. and kayla came and saw me too. and madison and cat! thanks yall. dom and kayla stuck out the longest then dom had to go home.. and me and kayla went to sonic to get me a choc. shake and hung out at williams for a little while. my cheeks aren't that big... but they are bruised or something. mom called and got mad b/c she said i needed to come home and put ice on my face so we didn't get to stay that long. i miss kay we haven't hung out in a while.  i don't understand that i haven't passed out since i got them out.. i'm like wired. dominique was like dude what is wrong with you? haha i have no idea? hopefully i will have a fast recovery. it's nice that my mom is actually worried about me and worried about me needing stuff.. and she's like just call my cell if you need anything so i won't have to get out of bed. kind of nice having people waiting on you hand and foot. but this stitch that is like half out is pissing me off.. b/c i keep feeling it and it feels like whiskers or something. AHHH haha ! i think it's time for me to go to bed.. i'm so delirious.  it's kind of depressing thinking about how many much of my summer assignments i have left and i really don't want to do it.. there's this little demon that's always laughing at me though saying i'm going to get a zero. normally it's a positive person pushing me to do things.. but this is a bad voice. jill knows what i'm talking about... me and jill have positive voices in our head that talk us through tests. hahaha! but i think this is my procrastination demon. that son of a bitch needs to go away or i will never finish my stuff.  i can't wait to go to houston this weekend though. i miss my laura and i need to finish up my school shopping. :o)  that's all for now. later.

      i mean honestly... do yall have better things to talk about than my affairs and what i'm doing? okay i'm glad you don't have a life of your own that you have to talk about other people. some people are just so immature and annoying that it makes me want to throw up. talking about other people should NOT make you feel better. and also it's awesome when you are in college and you have nothing better to do than get in the middle of highschool gossip. that's fucking immature.  well i get my wisdom teeth out in like an hour and 30mins :-/ and i'm scared. but more than that i'm thirsty... b/c you can't drink or eat like 6 hours before the thing and i could really use some water right about now.  oh yeah last night i went to shane's and hung out for a little while.. and i met the new girl, alex. she's really a cool person from what i know of her. and it was funny seeing all the drunk people.  but i had to go home at like 1030 b/c the mother was a little bit cranky. haha  that's about all.. what a short blog. yeah i know. later.

      my mom is a total pyscho... i mean yeah i'm a smart ass.. please get used to it. but lately she just has been yelling at me like there is no tomorrow or something. i'm like please get me out of this place before i scream. so right now i'm about ready to pack all my shit and go somewhere.. but then i realize i have no where to go. dads? ooh HELL NO. but i'm going to suck it up. i have 2 more years...yeah. not soon enough i know.  last night was girls night at mils.. which was a lot of fun. but me mandey and catherine have this genius idea that we want to go visit some friends. when it is freaking storming outside... i'm talking dangerous weather. oh but mandey being the little hardass she is drove in it ( me and catherine were both in the back seat freaking out. ) yeah imagine 3 girls running with trashbags on their heads with only 2 trashbags. me and catherine had both our heads in one. it was quite amusing and catherine broke her shoe and had to go out barefooted. then we went and picked up madison to go to calebs to hang out with like 8 guys or something and just sat there the whole time and watched them play ping-pong. how exciting right? oh yeah and amanda like came back to mils crying b/c it started pouring when she was out getting food or something and her window is broke and she was like holding a towel in the window trying to drive.. she was freaking out. quite amusing. and us being fatass's ate brownies and cookies.. well somewhat cookies madison and amandas dumbass's can't cook cookies if their life depended on it. that's what happens when you put 2 of the dingest girls in the kitchen together. and then i had to bring mady to get her charger b/c she couldn't live without her phone or something. b/c it went dead... ( the rain had stopped somewhat by then.. thank goodness). but it ended up being a great night bonding with the girls. we all had a goodtime. and mom actually let me stay the night at mils without parents. i mean she had to have been drunk or something. good times.  today i was pretty freaking lazy and i had to bring judson somewhere.. blah blah. and then i went to zacharys to hang out with some friends and watched people play pool and ping-pong. and bonding with some people i'm not really that close with so that was good. mrs. julie baked us cookies!!! YuM. :-P zac's parents are the best.  then i had to go get judsons bitch ass from next level.. ugh. and then bring scott home. i mean seriously.. am i a damn taxi? yeah it freaking seems like it.  louisiana definately won miss teen america! woohoo. atleast something good comes out of LA. i mean shit i want out of this place.  going to houston to shop next weekend. and visit with laura and fam. but i'm out b/c i've said all i really want to say. later.

( maybe that's why i've been so cranky today... ?)  so then i went to cheer prac.. woohoo there was only 8 varsity cheerleaders there so yeah we just shit around and did absolutely nothing. and morgan went on and on about how scared she was to get her wisdom teeth out... i'm just excited i'm going to be knocked out and doing nothing but sleeping for like 5 days. :-D YAY. and she is just beyond herself with excitement that we are getting them out the same day by the same person. yeah but that's morgan for you.. she's the happiest person i know.. and i really don't know how she does it? whatever she is on.. i think i need some. then i bring jill home all the way to BFE.. but hey i had nothing else better to do.. i needed a drive to take my mind off things.  get home.. mom's being somewhat nicer than she was earlier today and she was being EVIL earlier today. my god. she was about ready to boot my ass out of the house. but maybe it was b/c i was being a pain in the ass b/c i was so cranky. so she got me chinese food ( YAY ) which is freaking awesome.  then i watched summerland- yay. good show. but i want to O.C. to start coming back on and one tree hill. gosh i miss those shows.  at about 9:30 i went and met up with the guys and just hung around watching larry the cable guy dvd.. which was fun. and saw the ugliest dog i've ever seen in my life. dude i'm talking about this dog was HIDEOUS.. you think i'm joking. but you will see one day when you take a look at that thing. and they call her lady.. more like nasty. gosh i don't see how anyone would want to buy a dog that disgusting looking.. much less let it inside their house. blah. people these days. but i guess it's what's on the inside that counts. but that's dogs inside aren't so pretty either.. it's annoying as all hell.  i watched startsky and hutch when i got home.. and that is a funny movie everyone. you should watch it. it's worth renting.  still cranky--bed time. laterrrr

      i hate being confused. it's the worst state of mind one can have.. well that's my opinion. i mean who wants to sit there and not know what to do about EVERYTHING. i'm at one of those points in my life to where i don't know what i like and what i want. i mean i know what i want in my future but i don't know what i want now. make any sense? probably not.. b/c yeah it's me. why can't everything just fall into place like i want it? i mean why does life have to be so damn complicated and you never get what you want.. it's just so unfair. BLAH.. life sucks.  anyways tonight i went to the marshland festival with manda and  fallon and it was pretty fun.. a bunch of cowboys and hicks that stared me down. listen to this shit.. me manda and fal walked past this group of guys and this one guy was like 1 pussy 2 pussy 3 pussy.. i was like you are freaking disgusting dude. i mean honestly who freaking does that? well then we went to ross's little camp out thing to just hang out.. and i reunited with my best friend who's freaking awesome ( scotttttt ) we haven't talked in a while so it was quite nice. and i got to see a lot of old friends.  then me and fal hauled ass through wal-mart to get poker chips for my mom and we had to be home at 1230 for fal to call her mom b/c her mom said she couldn't go to walmart that late at night.. ha it was hilarious. and these guys were like dude what are yall on? and i was like i'm in a hurry and i asked them where the poker chips were and they were like well i know where the lay chips are.. i was like bitch i'm not high i don't have the munchies. god. people these days!!!!  i have insomnia AGAIN. i like can't sleep or something.. i used to sleep ALLLL the time. well not anymore.. something is wrong with me. BLAH  i'm going do something else. i've said all i want to say. :o) lattttterrrr.
