       In my world, being mistaken for an undercover celebrity is the highest form of praise.  &nbsp;  I don’t mean to disappoint anyone who was misled by the title of my postings and expected to hear a juicy exposé from Jennifer Anniston or Reese Witherspoon – I am neither. Though this does bring up a certain pressing topic – one which causes my friends, co-workers, and the occasional therapist to believe that I am mildly delusional and in need of a straight jacket. And that is that I do believe that Britney Spears and I are one in the same.  &nbsp;  Let me clarify, as I so often must. I do not think I am Britney Spears, rather I think  she  is  my  alter ego. I suppose that qualifies me for a superiority or God complex with a side of psychosis. But I say, if that entitles me to a straight jacket, bring it on. I love outerwear. But I’d like to request an olivey-khaki color – it’s so in for autumn.  &nbsp;  This brings up another good point. (You will soon learn that I think all of my points are good.) Why is it that all of the seasons are given a name, but fall/autumn gets two? Sometimes I think that we, as a society, just try to create drama and confusion for ourselves. I for one am taking a stand. I have made a commitment to refer to the upcoming season as autumn. I think it just brings to mind a clearer vision of deep orange and red leaves. ‘Tis the season.

      So I think I’ve come to that place in my life where I truly appreciate the lifelong union between man and wife. Don’t get me wrong, I have always had the utmost respect for the sanctity of marriage, but it wasn’t until recently that I understood the pragmatic perks, if you will, that come with the territory.  Take, for instance, the case of the bocce ball set. I have acquired an absolutely awesome bocce ball set – perfect for those all-day beach trips. But there is a dark side to the perfect, championship quality bocce ball set, and that is that it has a weight approximating the tonnage of a Volkswagen Beatle – the new ones – convertible, or hard top, whichever you prefer. Hence, the bocce ball set has taken up residence in my trunk, because I have neither the necessary brawn or desire to remove it. No joke.  (I promise I’m about to make my point regarding marriage really soon. But before I go any further I must interject that my roommate and I are among the remaining single people in Southern Orange County.)  So we’re all headed to the beach the other day and one of our married girl friends can’t make it but her husband still joins in the fun. He became what I will fondly refer to as “floater husband”. I have yet to unravel they mysterious change that takes place in a man's soul upon acceptance of marriage vows. All I know is that there is an obvious distinction between those who are married and those who remain single. I am sure that there are a myriad of possible explanations, but to go into all of them is too great a tangent, even for me.  Back to our saga… When we all got to the beach, not only did floater husband drop us off at the nearest possible entrance while he went to park the car a half-mile away in the blazing heat. But when he finally met up with us, lo and behold, he had the bocce ball set in tow. Dost mine eyes deceive me? It was like an angel had descended from the heavens.  (Interjection #2: Though I am nowhere near being a feminist, I am an independent spirit. I’ve made it through the first 26 ½ years of my life just fine. If something needs to be fixed or assembled, I just figure out how to do it. I didn’t need to be dropped off at the curb at the beach that day. There have been countless times when my roommate Abby and I have lugged an umbrella, towels, and other necessary beach-going paraphernalia without any hesitation… but having someone offer to do it for you just because it’s considerate and courteous was just about the coolest thing I have ever experienced.)  Fast forward to Tuesday night. Abby and I were making the necessary preparations for dinner guests on Wednesday – thawing the meat, putting our most respectable magazines at the top of the stack, making sure the remote controls are neatly lined up on the coffee table as if we live like that all the time, etc. Anyway, we had this plan to make truly delicious turkey burgers for dinner when the unthinkable happened. The BBQ was out of propane.  Huh? The propane tank is to the BBQ what pens are to a desk – you just have to believe that somehow there will always be an available supply. Who runs out of propane? I always see our neighbors barbequing. Never have I seen one of them lugging a propane tank around. Abby and I looked at each other truly baffled and had an unspoken conversation of shared glances that only roommates of five years can have. “It’s your barbeque” “But you use it more” “Your cat peed on the carpet and I cleaned it up” “I take out the trash and unloaded the dishwasher” “Rock, paper, scissors?” “Too risky” “Should we just move on to plan B for dinner and hope that the propane tank will magically refill itself?” “It is decidedly so.”  Though we quickly determined that turkey tacos would be a big hit, we also realized that we'd learned an important truth. THIS is why marriage is such a good thing. For moments like this. Guys are just born knowing how to do things like fill a propane tank.  Don’t get me wrong. Abs and I could have figured it out… we would have brought out our "Do It Herself" tool kit, disconnected the tank, loaded it in our trunk and driven to the nearest gas station where we would have pathetically played our “I’m a girl” card until a kind-hearted man would offer to refill it for us.  But we maintained our dignity and the propane tank sits empty; beneath our barbeque.  Abby’s boyfriend is moving here from Minnesota in a week and half, we figure we can hold out on grilling until then.
