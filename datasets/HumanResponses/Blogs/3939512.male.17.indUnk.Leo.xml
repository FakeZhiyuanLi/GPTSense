      music - The After Dinner Payback by FATA  eh this song is ok. i'd say the best off TFWL.... nothing can beat Too Bad You're Beautiful though... FATA needs to redeem themselves. o well just my opinion. i also hate how much they use the E power chord. gosh it gets old.  well anyway i got off work an hour early which was nice. i seem to get off early a lot. i mean it wasn't that good i got off early cuz katie came to visit, and i missed her. agh.  well, we r going out tomorrow morning. we r gonna play tennis, then go to breakfast, then go swimming. sounds fun! r0ck. i saw vic at work tonight too. that was cool. i always like seeing people! come visit forest hill kleins.  . .  ok so i suppose thats all for now. bye kids.

      music - Vanus Empty by Dead Poetic  so i sit here reading "Verbal Workout for the SAT!" . wow.&nbsp; yeah i really need to read this whole book though. hopefully it will bring up my score.&nbsp; yeah i feel though, the SAT is like meaningless right now. its just something i don't feel like dealing with. but then i think, yeah this is gonna determine my life sort of. my future... blah since when does a fuckin' test determine where you'll be in 5 years. lol all the time.&nbsp; damn tests. i wish i was just naturally good verbally. i wish i read more.&nbsp; and ect. but that's just stuff i don't find of interest. . . oh well. they should make a guitar section on the SAT.&nbsp; yeah then what.  music - Feinbhas a Ghabail by Prayer for Cleansing  there's so much going on now.&nbsp; this fall is gonna be stressful as all hell.&nbsp; between college applications/searching/visiting, just normal highschool, work, friends, bands, and family stuff, i'm gonna die.&nbsp; i need a time management class .&nbsp; . or at least they should lighten up on highschool work for a bit or something. i dont know.&nbsp; teachers should know what we r going through, and not bother with all the homework. i suppose its somewhat of my fault to because of my choice for classes....... stupid APs. but yesterday at UMBC the guy told us, we look at strength of schedule b/w APs and Honors classes you should have many.&nbsp; . and many i do, 7 AP Classes total, 4 Honors classes.&nbsp; yeah r0ck.&nbsp; so i should get back to the Verbal Workout. .

      music - Ordinary Story by In Flames  the music right now... hmm what to say... i'm really not a big In Flames fan, but this song is just amazing.   a very nice day out today.. i visited UMBC. i really liked it. the campus was nice, it was midsized, completely wireless (r0ck).&nbsp; tour guide new a lot too, which was good.&nbsp; i just need to bring up the SATS a little bit.   after UMBC i went to chilis and had lunch, then i went home for like 10 mins, before heading out to go get a&nbsp;haircut. noted - a very needed haircut indeed. i saw meghan there. i haven't seen her since school. man everyone is so busy with this college stuff. crazyness. well it was nice talking with her to pass the 30 min wait. o well.   so now im here, and i'm typing this nonsense. ok . tis all. i gotta work tomorrow dammit. but i need $$$ badly.&nbsp; for all of you that are mentally challenged $=money. yeah i'm mentally challenged for saying something stupid like that.&nbsp;   music - Nevada's Grace by Atreyu  i've realized how much i'm gonna miss fallston after i leave. yeah it's exciting to go to college and such, but all the people i've met....i went into highschool, not knowing anybody.&nbsp; the friends i've made are so close to me now, it's just gonna be hard. starting over again pretty much...&nbsp; and there's always those people that you just wish you got to know a little better.&nbsp; but for me, i've done good i suppose. i'm decently shy, when it comes to new people. . i don't know what it is. some people though i just come right out. i wish i could be like that around everyone. blah.   - - - i feel every bone break - - - smashed into pieces - - -  &nbsp;

      music - Sonnet by Prayer for Cleansing  well i must start off by saying, too bad this band isn't together. i mean Between the Buried and Me are good, but Rain in Endless Fall... was just so awesome.   allison came over yesterday for a bit. we walked and the flies/flying insects kept attacking me. agh.&nbsp; for having only one lesson, she's good at guitar.&nbsp; most people i know can't form a chord without struggling with their fingers to arrange them.&nbsp; way to r0ck. i also think that i wanna take lessons.&nbsp; i don't know if they'd be of any benefit, but who knows?&nbsp; i've been self taught for 2 years now, and i'm good for that i suppose.&nbsp;  &nbsp;- - guitarness - - - for those that don't know me. i started bass 4 years ago switched to guitar 2 years ago. yes i still play bass, but guitar to me, is so much better.&nbsp; basses- squier p bass 4 string, ESP F-204.. guitars - washburn wgx208, PRS Santana II. . . amps - some practice piece and kustom bass amp.&nbsp; , also, a crate 120 watt 2x12. decent ehh.... processors - digitech rp200, dod bass30.&nbsp; thats pretty much it.   ok so i worked yesterday. it actually wasn't that bad. it was busy as all hell from like 4 till 8 but then it started to slow down which was nice. christina was there , till 9 so i got to talk to her for a bit. she seems really cool.&nbsp; also, i talked to the manager about moving to the pharmacy, he says i gotta call  the man  , Butch, who runs all the pharmacies for Kleins. blah. oh well.   i'm leaving for UMBC in about 45 mins. I've had my eye on this school for quite sometime, so i hope it lives up to my expectations.&nbsp; oh well, i didnt expect much from Towson, but it was very nice.&nbsp; so we'll just have to see.&nbsp;   hopefully, when i get back i'll go out somewhere .&nbsp; blah i gotta work on friday and sat, and sun. so no plans anymore. and my parents say i don't work any hours.... yeah right.&nbsp; i guess that's all for now.

      Music - You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison by My Chemical Romance &nbsp; i love the fact that i can just put whatever the hell i want here. like this has absolutely no meaning at all. i'm just loading songs onto my mp3ness player for the trip. so i can just rant and ramble on.&nbsp; so anyway, i gotta get my arse ready for this... LONG DRIVE. i suppose its not that long and i'm exaggerating a tad. at least its broken up.&nbsp; 3 hours to Oc. break. 2 hours to va beach. break and sleep. wake up then 7 hours to myrtle.&nbsp; 12 hours on the road. 7 hours with the portable dvd player woot! ha, that should make the trip a whole lot less hellish.&nbsp; loads of movies and random tv shows to watch: family guy, futurama, chappelle's show, simpsons, office space, and Kill Bill volume 1. ah i wish volume 2 was out and they'd package it with 1 in some special nonsense way. well i think next month it comes out.&nbsp; i suppose we are gonna leave soon.&nbsp;  &nbsp; music - This Is Your Life by Switchfoot &nbsp; i'm trying to think of anything else on my mind.... you really shouldnt have to think about stuff on your OWN mind, it should just sorta come to you. ya know? but  obviously  my mind doesn't work that way.&nbsp; ah damned ap stat and ap gov summer projects. also i think the SAT is complete crap. not just cause i can't break&nbsp;1300 but, colleges shouldn't base so much on it. ! i honestly have nothing else to ramble about right now.&nbsp; well one last thing... highly recommended bands that you probably don't know of by me:::::: &nbsp; something for kate, moments in grace, piebald (i suppose they r somewhat unknown...), azure ray.

      music - Paris in Flames by Thursday  well i dont know when it all hit me. but i think everything has happened before. in a universe before this one. if u believe in the expansion and eventual contraction of the universe it kind of makes sense. eventually the universe will stop expanding and contract , till full collapse.  and then, a start to a new universe. but if everything doesn't go as it did for the previous beginning then , the universe will not be the same, and humans wont exist. life wouldn't exist. everything needs to be the same.  hence, if everything is the same, this has all once occured. millions of times maybe. however many times the universe has expanded and collapsed. now this could be the first time with the universe and it all may just end.  but if the theory is right... then yeah. thats just weird. i could have already typed this in. who knows.  its just really got me thinking.  bah.
