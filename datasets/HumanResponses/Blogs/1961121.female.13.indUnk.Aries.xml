      6/12  MADISON, Wisconsin.  Aarushi, after a long wait and tragic years of begging and earning was finally allowed by her parents to get her hair streaked red. She and her friend Allie, made the appointment, just minutes in advance.       The stylists names were Amanda and Rebecca (the bad one in the bible, as the stylist later remarked.) They started by asking us what color we wanted our hair to be. Aarushi chose red, while Allie chose purple. They divided the hair into sections and coated it with hair color formula. "They actually lightened my hair first, then blow-dried it and it had caramel streaks." They then put in the red color and washed and dried her hair. "It kinda came out more orange than red," says Aarushi Agni.    "My stylist was really cool. I was looking at this magazine and we were discussing the hottness of the guys," says the soon-to-be-13-year-old, "Only I wish she'd put more purple in. Oh well."     They came out of the experience with one thing for sure. "I'm wearing a hat around my dad from now on."

       Ten Things I hate about Guys  1. Okay, you're mad and they're sorry. You want to yell your head off, but they look so cute when they're sorry and you melt. 2. Belching, yelling and disruption. Do they think they look cool? 3. Those guys who only care about looks and won't even take a second to look at what's on the inside. 4. When all they talk about is sports or themselves. 5. What is with their love for action and violence? (I'm only speaking in general.) 6. When they laugh at unfunny things. Like when you trip.. 7. When they call you names such as, "Aaroogy-doogy" or "cockroach". 8. When they continuously talk about which girls they think are hot, yet say nothing about personality. 9. Guys who look at me like I'm the stupidest girl on earth. 10. When they make fun of you for something that happened like a million years ago.

         Top 5 Things that are so Overrated  (I'm too tired to do 10) 1. New Episodes- You're excited, you watch it, now it's old. We'll have to wait a whole week to see another. 2. Middle-school dating. Puh-leese. Do you actually  go  out? Or do you just tell the whole school that you're "going out" and just talk to each other between classes? 3. Having a trampoline. Once in a while, it's fun, when a friend comes over, but I seriously have better things to do than jump on my trampoline. I wish I had a pool. 4. Being popular. A lot of people are so low on self esteem, that they form a tight-knight little group known as the popular group. This group consists of a lot of peer pressure and stress. So trust me you're better off being a normal. Or a weird. 5. Playing games to get someone to notice you. If you just be yourself and be sincere than they should notice you and if they don't it's their problem, unless you're a jerk. But you're probably not.

       Reasons why I Hate Emma Watson   -She always looks so smug.    -She finds reasons to hang around older guys.  -She doesn't stand up for smart girls everywhere because she's just another pretty face with a perfect body who flirts and giggles and is disturbingly bubbly.  -Isn't it ironic that out of the maybe 5 million girls who wanted the part the one who was the best, also had a pretty face and perfect body and had no acting experience aside from a couple school plays?  -She always gets dressed up like a show dog whenever she goes out. But when she has a photo shoot, they make it look like she's "just a normal girl." Oh please normal girls don't have thousands of dollars spent on their wardrobe!    Show dog    "Normal" girl  -She showed no signs of sadness when Katie Couric asked her about Richard Harris dying.  -She's too sugar coated.....

       10 things that I hate about the Holidays  1. No Homework ---> nothing to do. 2. No School ------> no people except for family. (see 8.) 3. I have to go Christmas shopping and buy something for everybody. 4. Everyone else has family obligations and doesn't have time for fun things and sleepovers. 5. I have to find something to put in people's stockings. 6. People get mad because you keep saying that you don't have to do anything cause it's the holidays. 7. Christmas songs get stuck in my head. And not everyone's Christian!!!! 8. Everyone in the family is majorly stressed out and my sister snaps at me for everything I say. 9. Presents are so materialistic. 10. Denominational decorations suck. Nondenomination!

        Earlier today, me and my good friend Eba (Elizabeth), were discussing how hot fictional characters can seem to be. It can be really frustrating because you've found Mr. Perfect. The only problem is that he's a fictional character. This brings on my list of:    Fictional Characters that I would marry if I could   1. Michael from the Princess Diaries. Okay, how sweet is this? He sticks with her even when she has to walk around with a body guard, actually called her father who is the prince of a country and writes her songs. (Plus he's a senior and that doesn't hurt either does it?)  2. Ron Weasley from Harry Potter. So obviously in love with Hermione, has a fit when she goes to a ball with a famous Quidditch player, is loyal, caring and sweet. (I especially love the part in the 5th book when Hermione says asks why Ron is so bothered that she's writing to Krum and that she can have a pen-pal if she wants. "He didn't only want to be your pen pal!")  3. Cameron from 10 things I hate about you. Talks to the scariest guy in school who almost saws off his hand, remembers little details about things she likes, gets into a fist fight.. all for the girl he loves. (I love the part when Bianca realizes how totally scummy that other dude is and totally kix his ass for ever trying to nail her.)  4. Ray from Radio Free Roscoe. Same thing as with Ron. I just love guys who have it bad for good friends. Plus it's totally awesome when she and him are discussing gender politics when the root of it is, he's mad at her for going out with someone.  5. Tom on Daria. Is totally nice to her and challenges her opinions and thoughts.   6. Joe in Bend it like Beckham. He was totally sweet and understanding of her family traditions. Plus the fact that he was willing to have a long-distance relationship with her. (He also told her that her parents don't always know what's best for her which is awesome advice, because sometimes you just have to break free of your chains and be a free spirit.)  7. Milo on Pepper Ann. He's an awesome friend, he's funny and he's an artist.  8.  Patrick Verona in Ten things I hate about you. Okay this guy SANG A SONG on the PA system during gym class and did snazzy dancing to regain Kat's trust and speaking terms. Aww!!!!!!! (Plus he's played by oh-so-adorable Heath Ledger who I would marry anytime and anywhere.)   9. Edward from The Prince and Me. This guy sacrificed his throne for this girl. Now that's love.  10. Whoever Adam Sandler played in 50 First Dates. The sweetest thing you could ever do for a girl is remember her. Even when she always forgets that you're alive.
