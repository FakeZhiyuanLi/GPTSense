       woo  what an amazing party.. me and a few friends; tom, steve, adele and ben trecked into countersthorpe to this house party. We only knew about 3 people there. yeash. it was really good though. met this girl called becky and she is wicked marn.   'benneh'  some crazy fool called benny or 'benneh' decided to pull a knife on my good friend tom because he spilt a beer or something silly.. but steve sorted it out by stealing one of mine and giving it to him to calm him down.   golf  what a fucking twat. me and adele were just sitting on the kerb outside the house, and this crazy golfer comes up to us with a golf club, and tells us to piss off back inside; 'i like a party as much as the next man.. but me missus has got to sleep, y'know' what the funk did he bring a golf club for.. if he used it he wouldve killed someone the crazy mofo.   collage   take a look at adeles collage   urlLink here.   mega. x

      Wow we had an amazing storm earlier. well i suppose a lot of people did. it was really cool.. well i hope no one died. Apparently its like the tail end of that hurricaine in the USofA, but who knows. Charley, or Charlie or something. There was a lot of hail, a LOT, and my brother was stupid enough to go for a walk in the park just before it started, and he left his window wide open; what a fool. anyway heres a photo i took:   urlLink    (click to enlarge)

      so i took the jeans back today.. they were a little annoyed i hadnt got a receipt, but agreed to exchange the jeans. Only to get home and find (yes i did try them on at the shop) that they were massive around the waist, but the leg was fine. this is getting annoying.  are the olympics still on?

      how silly am i. i bought a pair of jeans that are w-30, l-30. When i tried them on, they looked a little too short, but i thought they would do. But when i got back home to re-try them on they were half way up my shins.. ha and ive only gone and lost the receipt. i hope i can exchange them. i cant complain about the kebab i just bought though

      not only has neighbours been cancelled for about 2 weeks, but so has all the other great television which is normally on. For example; malcolm in the middle and fresh prince on bbc2 every day.. and also monday night comedy on 2...  Who even watches the olympics? Does a country win overall? The olympics have taken over tv. bye x

      my mum gave me a can of tetleys bitter today.. i have to say, it was probably the worst alcoholic beverage i have ever tasted.. Why do people drink it? its only 3.8% or something, its just silly. I suppose its for the tougher men - it does sponser Engand Rugby.. blaughhguhfdgh

      well, im on my crappy computer which is in the corner of my room, whilst tom is playing computer games on my usual computer. Whats worse is that this computer only has a black and white monitor, and only a keyboard. i love it though.

      Haha i just saw my ex girlfriend walk past my window. im sure she spat on my front. Today i walked into the city centre with my friend - which is always a good thing to do, as it takes around 30 minutes to get there, so nice and healthy, and then another 30 minutes to return home. But as i had £5 spare, i thought id buy 3 double cheeseburgers and 2 medium cokes. So thats 2 DCB for me and one for tom. FAT.. I tell you. I may as well have stayed at home
