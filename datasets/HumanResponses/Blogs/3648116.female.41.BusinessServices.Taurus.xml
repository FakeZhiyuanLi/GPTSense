        When I first embarked upon the grand journey of writing my first novel, I had no idea what I was doing. Today, two years later, I have a pretty good idea. I am exceedingly grateful to all the authors out there who have so graciously shared their knowledge and experience with the rest of us.   There are five key elements which must be incorporated into the writing of a novel. Although there are more elements than these, the five in focus here will enable you to begin work on the tale begging to be told.   Setting  This is the first element you may want to consider as you ponder your great idea. From my own perspective and experience, it’s easiest to describe a setting you are familiar with. By doing so, you are able to draw upon your own unique perspective, both visually and emotionally. Allow all those feelings of nostalgia to shine through, breathing life into the story by transporting the reader to the setting through sight, sound, smell, taste and touch.   If the setting you desire is one you aren’t familiar with, I recommend talking to people who have visited or are from the locale you have in mind. I know one writer, who while on vacation in France, decided she would kill off a character who was taking over the story. She took note of each locale they visited and even had her family on the look out for the right setting. Over dinner in a restaurant one night, her daughter in law, who is very quiet said in a delighted and rather loud voice, “Mom, would this be a good place to kill Eddie?” Needless to say, everyone in the restaurant was more than a little curious about the comment. The waiter approached and cautiously asked if everything was all right, and my friend said, “Everything is great, we’re just planning a murder.” She didn’t choose to kill Eddie there, but it makes for great conversation.   Conflict   What’s a story without conflict? It’s the staple of our lives. Conflict allows us to form our own opinions as we learn and grow through a complex chain of events. We make mistakes and surmount overwhelming odds, and are rewarded with a flood of varying emotions and hopefully a renewed sense of self and vision. A life without conflict is an existence without meaning or purpose. Give your novel a strong purpose and give your characters a strong conflict to resolve. When we read about fictional characters facing fears, plagued with set backs or fighting against the world for what’s right, we feel their pain, relate to the fears and cheer when they’ve obtained their goals. A strong conflict makes for a good night reading a book, and chewing your nails down to nothing as you are drawn into the unfolding drama and wondering how you yourself would respond.   Character   A story would be meaningless without characters for us to relate to. When writing a novel you want your characters to tell the story through their actions and dialogue. When developing your main character, you want this person to be intriguing and unique, yet you want them to seem real in the mind of the reader. Don’t be afraid to give your character flaws either in personality, reasoning or motivation. The conflict of the story could involve the character’s need to rise above those flaws, either for the purpose of gaining something in the material world or for the purpose of gaining self respect. The spectrum of possibility is limitless, and since most people aren’t perfect, the reader will relate to the character’s flaws.   A character is more than the description of his or her physical attributes. Granted, you may have painted the picture of a beautiful red head with hazel eyes and a curvaceous figure, but who and what is she? What are her values? What does she desire? Even though she’s beautiful, why do her eyes focus on the ground beneath her feet? You have a strapping young man who’s embarked upon a journey across America. Why has he sold all his possessions and turned his back from all that he once knew? Why does he keep looking over his shoulder and why does he have those dark, sagging circles under his eyes? These are details the reader wants to know, and although you don’t always have to explain, you can use these underlying reasons to your advantage.   Dialogue   Dialogue and action are the wheels which propels the story forward. Without dialogue you have nothing more than a narrative, a written monotone. You want your readers to keep turning pages, which won’t happen if they’re falling asleep or confused. You can never have too much dialogue, it is in fact the dialogue which will help you to develop the characters and explore the depths of their convictions, emotions and motivations. Through the dialogue you may be able to further develop your plot and conflict, by expressing the inner most emotions, fears or desires of your characters through the ‘spoken’ or rather ‘written’ word of dialogue.   Keep your dialogue as realistic as possible and easy to read and follow. Try not to use dialects or slang except when absolutely necessary. Does your dialogue have a purpose other than filling space? It should reflect the theme of the story and it should be relevant to what’s happening. Good dialogue has a purpose and if it’s well written, it will help the reader move through the story with clear understanding of what is happening.   Action  Observe your surroundings and people. Take note how hey interrelate and how they move. Notice facial expression, body language and ticks. When we think of action, we generally think swash buckling sword fights, dramatic escapes and glorified rescues. Although such would make for good reading, you must also consider how Randy knows Carla is about to blow her top, even when she’s masking her feelings. How does Duke know Earl is holding a full house, and his royal flush is going to insure his bread and butter for the next month? How would Steve climb up the ladder if his recent fall was fresh in his mind? As you can see, there is subtle action and explosive action. Be sure to use and focus on both when appropriate.   There are so many things we take for granted on a day to day basis. We walk out of the grocery store and aren’t aware that we nearly ran an old woman down with our cart. Try to formulate in your mind what her response would have been. How many times have you come home with a few bags of ‘stuff’ and put the contents away without thought, only to have no recollection where you put that one particular item you went to the store for in the first place?   Have you ever noticed how uncomfortable some people are eating in public? How do you know they’re uncomfortable? What does it mean when your dog’s ears are back a little, but not tight against his head? Take note of how Johnny reacts when Terry races to the one empty swing at the park and scoots into it before him. What does he do when she laughs and sticks her tongue out at him? How does Mary react to Tommy when he calls her a zit faced, four eyed, freak? How does your three year old behave when lying as opposed to how your twelve year old behaves when doing the same?   All these elements are vital to the success of your endeavors. Don’t be afraid to explore all the possibilities. Go out and notice your surroundings, notice the people you encounter and listen to what is being said and what isn’t. Try to figure out the drama of their play as they all struggle for position and power against one another, and you’ll find a wealth of ideas to inspire a not only a good novel, but a great novel.

      Jerry Pournelle, a technical columnist and writer of fantasy once said, “I am sure it has been done with less, but you should be prepared to write and throw away a million words of finished material. By finished, I mean completed, done, ready to submit, and written as well as you know how at the time you wrote it.” The first time I read that statement I thought there was no force in heaven or earth powerful enough to make me throw away a million words. Since that time, I think I’ve thrown away twice that amount.    The drive behind writing a million words and throwing them away is desire, coupled with what one believes is a good idea. I don’t know if there’s such a thing as a bad idea, but perhaps there are good ideas lacking in planning, development and discipline. My father once told me that if it’s in a book and you can read, you can learn to do it. I’ve discovered that to be very true. I learned to cook by reading, and the same is true with training horses, wilderness survival, art, sewing, designing web pages, repairing guns and of course, writing. If you have a desire, then you can achieve just about anything you want to. You don’t need a degree in Literature or English to write well or to write a novel.    Many an author spent his or her youth desiring to write, and found his or herself hidden away in a bedroom writing continually in spiral notebooks. I’ve accumulated enough writing through the years that I could compete with Staples if the pages were blank. We all told ourselves that when we entered into adulthood, we would write and be satisfied, if not live in complete euphoria. Then we reached the age which ritualistically cast us to the cold dark world full of wolves and instead of writer satisfaction, we spent a lifetime working at a job we hated.    If a typewriter or computer is placed before that same person, a glow begins to emanate from his or her being and within a short time that person is reintroduced to their childhood passion to write. That passion is delicate in the beginning and, at the request for critiques, can often be destroyed along with all the confidence and courage the budding author has gained. If this is your experience, a few trips to the library or the bookstore can be of great value in regaining your stride and bandaging your wounded confidence.    Find a few books on writing or even visit a few sites on the internet. A person who’s decided to take the plunge can glean a lot of useful information and tools for becoming a good writer and getting a novel from page one to page five hundred. Joining a writing group can be of help also. You can find them throughout the country and on the internet. They are filled with people of like mind and they all have a desire to write. You will find much encouragement and a wealth of knowledge in such places.    Once you’ve dried your tears or calmed your anger, and gained some perspective on how to proceed, throw all those words away and start again. In the book, How to Write Books That Sell, the authors L. Perry Wilbur and Jon Samsel tell the tales of two writers who threw their manuscripts away. Robert Louis Stevenson once threw away a full manuscript that he wrote while laying ill in bed for days. He read it to his wife and her criticism caused him to throw it away and begin anew. After a few more days, working from the same idea, he completed The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, which became a bestseller within six months. Author James L. Halperin rewrote The Truth Machine twenty-three times! He credits the publication of the book to “dumb luck” which I doubt would have happened at all if he hadn't rewritten it twenty-three times. He had a desire that burned through him like a fire, and he learned quickly that throwing away a million words wasn’t the end of the world. Instead, it was a rebirth.    After sharing thoughts with many writers on the subject of writing, I have found we all have one thing in common. Writers want to share their unique perspective on the world. The reasons can vary from wanting to give others a new view of the world to wanting to change attitudes one word and one person at a time. They all have a love for the art and craft of the written word and they all seem to see things differently than others. They all believe writers have a power owned by a few, often compared to the influence a teacher has over the students in his or her charge. There’s nothing as enduring as the written word. People come and go and good deeds often go unnoticed or soon fade away from memory, but a book lasts a lifetime. A book is a testament to the will and courage of humanity.

      My youngest son has had a profound impact upon my life and attitudes. Seth is sixteen and towers over me. Although he could impose brute force upon anyone smaller than he, it has never happened. He could be an imposing young man weighing close to one hundred and seventy pounds, but his personality is as gentle and bright as his golden eyes.   Seth has an energy about him that is like a magnet attracting steel and iron. He’s a Gemini and his astrological symbol is the Twins. They say that Gemini’s have something like a split personality or that they’re two-faced. When I look at my son and contemplate his life, I see the outward reflection of an inner struggle. Seth isn’t two-faced and he doesn’t have a split personality. No one has ever had the opportunity to see him through my eyes.  America’s mythic heroes usually have dual identities, such as Superman, Batman and Spiderman. They are all the creation of someone’s idealized imagination, but Seth is flesh and blood. Like these American heroes, Seth has suffered several unfortunate experiences in his young life.   He reminds me of a young Clark Kent, only a youth not so fortunate to be found by a loving Jonathan and Martha Kent. Try to imagine the struggles Superman would have had as a youth if he would have been found by the Hatfields or McCoy’s. Then you’ll have a little understanding of the boy who is Seth. He hasn’t seen his father since he was two, and as if to add insult to injury, he had a step-father that abused him until he was seven.  The abuse came to a sudden end one day when his step-father, Gene and I had another argument. This time it ended with me laying unconscious on the kitchen floor. Seth thought quickly and grabbed his little sister by the hand and led her to a neighbor’s house where he frantically called the police. Gene was arrested that day and we soon divorced. That day, Seth became a hero. For a year after that, he and his sister spent a year with my parents in Arizona while I tried to get my life put back together again. It wasn’t easy.  When he was in the third grade, his teacher requested a conference regarding Seth’s behavior and lack of effort on assignments. During this conference it was pointed out that Seth lacked respect for his teacher. The man’s arms flew through the air and he spat accusing words between barred teeth. Sitting in the small chair with my knees stuffed and locked beneath a child's desk, I understood why Seth had no respect for his teacher. I asked Seth why he wouldn’t do his homework and he said, "All I want to do is play." It was the pure honesty of a child. Who wouldn’t rather play? I understood and believed time would bring him around. That year I gave him the name, Leaping Bear.  He continued to have problems in school and at home. Like the Twins, he was and is a living, breathing contradiction. I remember stepping into his disastrous room one day to find a complex creation of legos standing erect in the center of a small clear space. He eagerly asked me to look at what he’d made. His little chest puffed out as he explained the things his invention did.   When Seth was ten, I was called to a conference with another frustrated teacher. I sent him and his sister out to play on the playground and said I’d come for them when I was done. Seth, being three years older was to keep an eye on Danae. Watching over her was something he didn’t mind. The responsibility made him feel grown up. The two went to the sandbox and were soon joined by a thirteen year old boy they decided to befriend. Andy seemed nice enough and Seth was more than happy to play with another boy for a change.  They hadn’t been playing long when two more boys came upon the scene. Steven and Derek were both eleven. Steven stopped and whispered in Seth’s ear, "You shouldn’t be playing with him, he’s bad news."  Seth didn’t like the sound of it and visions of Gene filled his mind. He looked at his younger sister, "We have to go now."  As Seth climbed to his feet, Andy did too. "I just want to be friends," he cried.  Seth began to grow tense with Andy’s change in attitude. "Come on, Danae. Let’s go find mom," he urged her. As Danae rose, her pants and small hands covered in sand, Andy seized her arm and pulled her from the sandbox. "Let her go," Seth demanded as he stepped toward them.  Andy pulled two straight edged razors from his pocket and pressed them to Danae’s throat. "Stay back," he warned in a dark tone as he continued to drag her toward the street.  Steven pulled Seth back, "You guys distract him," he whispered. As Seth and Derek continued to try to talk Andy into letting Danae go, Steven circled around behind him and picked up a branch buried in the grass. Seth and Derek continued to back Andy up until Steven was close, then he bashed him in the head with the branch. Stunned, Andy dropped the blades and Seth pulled Danae from his grasp. Andy made a quick escape. For the second time in three years, and with the help of two young strangers, Seth was a hero again.   My son confounds me. When the situation calls for deliberate and swift action where someone’s safety is concerned, he’s like lightning racing across the sky. At the same time, where his own safety is concerned, sometimes he does nothing.   Right after school started last year, one boy accepted a two dollar bet and attacked Seth during lunch. The boy beat Seth’s head against a brick wall and a thick water pipe. Later, Seth said he didn’t fight back because he didn’t want to get suspended. When the two were taken to the counselor’s office, the counselor told me Seth responded with wisdom and showed more compassion and understanding than he’d ever seen in a boy his age.   Just a month ago at school, Seth witnessed a boy beating on a girl in his English class. Seth didn’t know either one of them, but knew they were in a relationship. The teacher did nothing and Seth’s sense of justice wouldn’t allow him to stand by. He rose to his feet and asked the boy what he thought he was doing. When the boy didn’t answer, Seth said, "You don’t treat women like that." He pressed his face in the boy’s and said, "Meet me anytime after school and I’ll show you what it’s like to be abused." The boy hasn’t hit his girlfriend since.  He continues to confound me. Getting him to do chores is like trying to pluck a brick from a wall. Last year Seth joined the Air Force Junior ROTC program. Since September of last year, Seth has logged more than one hundred and ten hours in community service. He plans on doing the same this year.   His grades border on failing, yet he wants to go to college and then enter the Marines as an MP. He hopes to study biology and engineering. He wants to help develop the Mars Space Station and find a way to extend human life and the quality of it. He’s certain the answer is in trees.   He’s very smart, often sharing his ideas and vision for the future. During these discussions it’s apparent to me he’s a deep thinker. This is something his third grade teacher never saw. His third grade teacher yelled often and tried to impose his will upon Seth. He never understood that he had long lost any hope of gaining Seth’s respect or cooperation because of his own attitude.   Seth has a desire that compels him to try to fit in, yet he insists on dressing and behaving differently than the norm. He’s had problems with peers through the years, yet adults are always impressed with him. He addresses strangers with, "Yes, ma’am," and "Yes, sir," but at home he’s very relaxed. He wears his hair very short in a military cut and his clothes reflect the style of a cultured gentleman. He reads Harry Potter and self help books, an odd combination. He’s changed a lot the last couple of years and he strives to encourage others and lift them up. He has a germ phobia and although portions of his bedroom are orderly, for the most part the room should be condemned.  Seth’s willingness to look at his own character defects has encouraged me and given me a sense of hope for his generation. Seth’s courage has given me the strength to be courageous too. Seth has taught me that you can never tell how a person will turn out once they’re grown. Those who judged Seth harshly as a child would be surprised to see the young man he is today. Even though he isn’t perfect by any measure, Seth is the reflection of the good and negative of human nature. I’m very proud of him.   Copyright 2002 Rocky Bellew

      Kids are our future. When you find a kid who gives freely to the community without expectation of receiving something in return, you know you’ve found a kid that brings hope for humanity’s future.  I’ve found about sixty-five such kids. They are enrolled at Summerville High School in Tuolumne, CA. They are Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors. Every year these kids have a toy drive for Christmas gift giving. The toys go to the needy who may otherwise not have a Christmas. Throughout the school year they volunteer their time and energy participating in The Special Olympics program so those who are at a disadvantage can practice for their annual games.   They give tours at the local Veterans' Museum and work at the Veterans' dinners, breakfasts and other events they promote. They help other local schools with various events. They volunteer and work for charitable organizations and service clubs in the area. They volunteer for the Literacy Program. They help Habitat for Humanity in their construction of homes for the needy.   They help build pens for orphaned or injured wildlife and help care for them. They march in the local parade and present the colors at school and local events. They direct traffic and parking at their home school during the football season. In all they are involved in thirty different events and organizations. In all they have contributed more than 20,000 hours of their time since 1988.  See below for a comprehensive list of activities they are involved in.   I’ve spoken with several former Summerville High AFJROTC students who have related experiences demonstrating how the program and instructors have changed their lives. Some say the instructors helped them find a better path in life. Others testify that the program and instructors helped rescue them from destructive lifestyles and choices. Others have related their life and career successes, paying tribute to the program and instructors.  Various organizations offer college scholarships for AFJROTC students who meet the above standards. Each year Summerville High AFJROTC students are presented with these scholarships. After graduation many students go on to college, and some pursue military careers, while others pursue careers in aviation. The program teaches Air Science, meeting pre-college requirements for Earth Science.   Though the Air Force pays for half of the instructors’ salaries, most maintenance and material fees, the district is short $22,000 in funding for next year’s AFJROTC program. Since April the boosters have raised in excess of $10,000 from local Veteran Organizations, businesses and individuals through fundraising efforts. We still need to raise approximately $12,000 to meet the district’s AFJROTC funding shortfall. Without funding our small community could lose this program.  The Junior R.O.T.C. program is a community service oriented program.  Students strive for discipline, honor, compassion, leadership, academic excellence and self reliance.  Many Junior R.O.T.C students go on to train in the military as service men and women.  Many Junior R.O.T.C students go directly to college or work after graduation.  Most Junior R.O.T.C students are better prepared for life on a personal and professional level than the average high school graduate.  The Junior R.O.T.C program offers a safe haven for many students who have no other place to turn in times of crisis.  Junior R.O.T.C Instructors serve as positive role models where such is lacking in the home and community.  The Junior R.O.T.C program changes lives, not just those of the students, but that of their families and within the community.  The Junior R.O.T.C program isn't just about military excellence. It's about people.  If you would like to help support this program, please make your check payable to: SONORA AREA FOUNDATION. In the memo line write: SUMMERVILLE HIGH ROTC FUND.
