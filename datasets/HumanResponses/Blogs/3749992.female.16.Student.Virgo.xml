      I've been looking at other wellknown blogs and they're super into all of this. I'm not sure I have that standard, that Protestant work ethic.  My brother and sister (7 and 2) broke the tail off the school's gerbil today. Gross. I was really upset at them, I hate when people torture animals and for the past 3 days we've had it, I kept telling them to stop. Then my parents were like "No, it's OK, they're just playing" and sure enough, something bad happened. UGH. I hate not being listened to.  What else... college apps came this week. Harvard, Dartmouth, and Colgate. It's going to panic me for the rest of the summer. I have to use 5 words to describe myself on the Dartmouth app, and I think it's impossible.  I don't know what to say without sounding egotistic!

      So....officially a blogger....simply because I wanted to comment on Jim Norton's blog and got sucked in to the mad world of blogging.  One day I will be as famous as Andrew Sullivan. You watch.

      Anchorman is COMEDY GOLD. If you've ever smiled in your life, Jesus, go see this movie.  "Their periods attract bears!"  "I will tell tales of your compassion."  "I drank a lava lamp. It wasn't lava."  "It works 70% of the time, every time." "That doesn't make any sense."  "Mi corazon es en fuego!" "I can't understand you when you speak like that!"  Steve Carell and Will Ferrell are geniuses.

      I'm back from Italy, and still in love with my bus driver, AnTONio. What a beautiful, sexy, wonderful seductorizer. I gush and foam at the mouth. I will move to Italy to marry an Italian man who speaks no English.   My Mormon name is  Katasha Kaysional Tempest !  urlLink What's yours?    Oh, AnTONio...  I told Senor via email (my ex Spanish teacher who is moving to Vermont, the jerk) that Angie and me were in love with AnTONio, and he said that hot Italians were always a good thing, which made me laugh heartily. I'm also in love with Senor, so that's a fun problem.  www.pointlesswasteoftime.com

      VACAY!!! Going on a 9 day tour of Italy with my high school choir. Excited beyond belief.  Also...I'm going to miss Anchorman while I'm away. SUCKS. Also going to miss July 4th. PATRIOTISM.  Ah well, what can you do. Italy rocks.  My choir teacher has imposed a bullshit dress code though. Shoulders=covered at all times. She's obviously never been to Italy when it's 150 FUCKING DEGREES OUT!  see you cats later.

      I've been away a long time, because I've been in England visiting me pops.  I found Snow Patrol there, which is fantastic because it's stimulated my creativity again, so I'm writing again, which is always good. "Run" makes me cry all the time, every time.  Also, Daniel is my muse, so he makes me write.  Every girl should have a much, much older boyfriend. Eh, 25 years difference isn't that much, right? I just...I just love Daniel. I wish I didn't, because his girlfriend drives me crazy and there's my dad who would flip...but whatever. You can't choose.
