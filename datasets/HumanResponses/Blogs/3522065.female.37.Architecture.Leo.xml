      i have to keep up on my reading because i feel like i am getting a bit on the slow side here. housewife brain it appears. i have one more work project to complete and then i can feel at peace. it is slow starting though and people are eagerly anticipating a fed-ex pack that holds the prescious drawings and i can not seem to get excited over the possibility that after that there is nothing more due, i think that is why i am stretching it out so long. i even have a small touch of depression...too many hours in the day to collect my thoughts about what really happend over the past month. too much. not to mention heads are getting cut off, people are being killed senselessly and we are all just here for minutes before we head on.  better figure out what to do with my remaining minutes and it better not be dumb.  link above on title:  on the positive side, porn is still being shot in the dear old san fernando valley. l.a. weekly does an expose' of sorts and if nothing else the cover of the mag is intriguiging. one of my favorite ardenwoods stories is the time i went to this loving grandmotherly type lady's house to talk about designing a new garden...after about two hours chatting and touring the property, she promptly told me she was an adult movie director and that all the movies were shot on the property--and did i have a problem with that? no, i replied dryly--just as long as they were not going to be shot while my guys were digging holes...might be a bit of a distraction for them.

      we were introduced to my new favorite restaurant. habibi's sister restaurant "kosherinksy" (i think that is how you spell it) egyptian food.   we went with the justine and stephen show--plus a few of their close friends.   i was not sure i had ever had egyptian food--middle eastern but not specifically egyptian. well i think the first sentence of this post says it all--my absolute new favorite place!  i am embarassed to say--that i dreamed about the food all night monday nite....dreams of hot and cold mezze, lamb roasted, cold beer..the meal just could not have tasted any better! upon my hours of obsession, i begged to go back--since we were already meeting kelly for dinner in central-it was the perfect opportunity to go back! garth wanted to try a new place--but i just had to have that damn food again! and you know what--it was even BETTER the second time--the lamb was even more succulent, the bread was hotter--our fingers got steamed off--but it was all worth it.  i hope i do not weigh 300 pounds upon heading back to california next year.  check out the photos at:  http://www.fotolog.net/ardenwoods/

      i think i might have officially decided i can survive  the junk boat trip.   steve and justine don't actually know this yet--something happend last night--there was a certain re-assurance that the damn thing would stop if i yelped loud enough--which gave me some sort of peace. knowing me--i would not stop a long voyage and ruin everyone elses day unless i am completely green around the gills--  now the dilemma is probably there are no more seats.   please advise.

      last night we met at one of mimi's bars she is promoting--staunton's. on the approach off the escalators, it reminded me of a bar i would haunt in college...a bunch of people chatting and milling about with drinks in their hands that appeared from first glances to all be on the prowl...but a lot older than college aged.  our hostess had 4 tons of sand brought in for the 'summer beach party' promotion.  all i kept thinking about all night-is "how the hell are they going to get all this sand out of here???" the entire floor of the bar was covered in 4-5 inches of sand--enought to dig your feet in and feel comfy. most of the gals had their shoes off which gave it even more of a 'beachy feel' hell we could be in santa monica at the jonathon beach club for all i knew!  adding to the realistic beachy feel was that it was 90 degrees in the bar--with 100% humidity. every one was a bit soggy by nine which added a very tropical sweaty feel to the mating dances going on!  check out the pictures at fotolog website:  http://www.fotolog.net/ardenwoods/

      we were invited to kieth and mimi's house last night to watch the grand finale of american idol. wait! didn't that happen in america almost three weeks ago??? yes, but kieth and mimi have attempted to keep it a secret to themselves. although i think both have their suspicions about the winner--or may even know who the winner is--but the fun is in the hunt not the kill. (although i think steve would have preferred the kill part last night) which reminds me--also present for the festivities...greyson, steve and justine and their friend kate--who is just passing through HK on a whirlwind ten month trek. ok. so we are all gathered for this pizza fest (which turned out to be surprisingly tasty pizza for HK) to pay homage to the "american idol" would it be phantasia or diana??? jesus, how did we get down to these two??? well, maybe phantasia is ok--i mean she has star quality and all--but "the american idol" ???  mimi-the hostess and the most earnest sincere person you would love to meet, was chatting kate up about her upcoming south-east-asia tour de force when american idol comes back on....a polite cut off and volume back up on the channel signaled to kate, ''we are done with our conversation, we can resume when the commercial comes back on'. (only problem--very few commercials in HK--so we never really did get to the bottom of why kate was traveling the globe for a year) maybe i can get to the bottom of that on some wretched junk boat trip. (more later)   so in between show tunes that the contestants belted out, (isn't america in trouble with enough of the world not to shamefully humiliate ourselves with bad music television all the way over here in dear sweet hong kong????) and steve snickering to himself--sipping a few beers...we proceeded with the idols.  only to find out this was NOT the last american idol. this was the one before the last. groans of dissapoinment from our crowd gathered that we would have to wait 2 more days to know the real truth. or the truth that they have chosen to tell us.  unfortuately i already know the winner, (yes, yes, i watched it in america with the rest of the helpless viewers)  and i am not sure i can sit through the grand finale again with paula, simon and randy and don't forget ryan seacrest.  mimi, keith you are on your own darlin's.  xoxo.

      we are working our way throught the one million (you think i exagerate!) eating places in this town. so far we have not ventured too far into the realm of hole-in-the-wall joints because we were not sure of my hepitis shot status--you have to be immune to (hep a) before they give you the thumbs up for eating off the beaten path. as it is we only risk gastritis and worms now, so we found out via the hospital here that i do not need shots! i am immune...woo hoo let the eating begin.  we decided to kick off the unstable eating environment on saturday nite--we went to the temple street night market in kowloon. (the other side of the island) the temple street night market is like hollywood sunday farmers market with mostly crap being sold. (stall after stall after stall after stall of tiny gold statues, cheung sam dresses, black market porn, black market first run movies, black market c.d.s) basically this could be called the temple street "black market"  but i think "night market" has a nicer ring. besides, it starts at 7:0clock p.m. every night--  after you crawl through a few blocks of stalls you can head over to the eating stalls--literally more like a garage on melrose and western if you get my drift. so we meander while all the shop owners hold menus up of little goodies you can't read except for the pictures...pretty agressive for you to try their special place...this is how it kinda went.  garth "this place looks good" nysha "i dunno" hesitant (asking intuitive self if hepitis shot is really good, and what about worms) garth "this one has some english on the menu" we stop. which bascially says "i want to come in" nysha "ummmm i'm not sure" maybe the next one, owner lady kinda chases us "good food, good food" garth "ok honey, whatever you feel comfortable with" we walk away. nysha (random pick) "how about this place"  pushy guy out front takes this as a complete we are ready to come in and ushers us in.  we get the prize table in the back of the garage, i mean stall, because it is near the air-conditioner wall unit that is suspended from i am not sure what.  owner guy "very good table, best, near air condish, best table, you'll like it"  we sit down. i immediately declare we are going to get sick from this place. garth did not think that was a good way to start our eating adventure and quickly ordered us a couple of beers. i remember from what little nursing classes i took, that alcohol kills bacteria. good, more beer. i drink a hefty swig and begin the germ killing process early. i figure if my lower bowel is coated in alcohol then maybe the bacteria will die as they come in contact with my entire g.i. tract.  ok--so that's a little dramatic--but i was a bit concerned.  we order--random items--probably too much--but we are on an eating adventure, right??  the food comes and frankly it is fine, i mean more than fine it is good/great. not the best stuff i have ever had--but hot, prepared with care, and more than that presented in a very homestyle fashion.   we left after a little skirmish over a vinegar bottle--maybe another day for that story.  and head home--all was fine.  a bit of grumbly tummy the next day but nothing that a good 7up did not cure...in fact garth and i both figured that it was more the mounds of chili sauce we both used and all the soy/vinegar sauce that might have talked back a bit and no germs at all!  see picture on fotoblog.com/ardenwoods  xoxooxx nysha

      i was doing all our hand wash on friday and it was a wonderful windy blustery day! i took careful stock of where to hang this stuff and hung a few clothes in garth's bathroom and one item in my bathroom.  opened all the windows in the house to get some cross-breeze action,  with the wind whipping and drying everything nicely. i hung my favorite j.crew shirt that was striped and wonderful in my bathroom. half way through the afternoon i went to check on my little chore in my bathroom and noticed my shirt crumpled up on the window sill, hanger and all. i had it hanging off the shower head and soon realized it was toooo close to the window--moved it to the other end of the shower rod and went back to my work...a few hours later i figured my clothes were dry--i would get ready to go out for dinner, and i could not find the shirt! i thought maybe it had fallen in the tub somewhere in our bathroom--no really it's quite tiny-- one glance would assure it was not in the bathroom. and then i realized. the damn shirt had blown down and out the window.  as a side note we have a very nice homeless man---(i can tell already this does not look good for those wanting to come visit) but half way up our little hill out our back area there is this guy who has set up camp. he is rumoured to have been there 10 years. i am not so sure of this urban legend, due to the fact of rain, typhoon, heat, winter blah blah blah--this guy would have to find indoor refuge--this ain't l.a. baby! so anyways i am almost possitive my shirt has blown into this guys life, not to mention two candles that were on the window sill also which garth had me convinced could kill someone or stick into their head like a little candle cap.  every so often one of us is caught hanging out the window peeking into the hill, studying it, looking for a striped whimsy in the trees, or on the homeless guys clothes line.  no luck.

      okay so the deed is done.  my hair is straight. not pin straight but straight enough. i went to esprit hair salon in causeway bay yesterday and endured seven (7!!!) hours of three people pulling, tugging, chemical dabbing and washing each and every hair on my little red-head!  at the end of the day i was like a cat in a bag. ready to bolt.   i also got the nifty asia haircut that is making the rounds! kinda morticia adams meets late night hostess elvira meets uhhh alf?  i think it looks ok. i am forbidden from mentioning my hair cut anymore--i have been caught looking in every piece of glass, mirror, reflective objects that i pass by the last 24 hours. i am sure it is annoying but it is fun to look at yourself isn't it???  my friend steph is getting married in a week--and i must call her and give her all my nuptial advice! (yeah right)  look for the new and improved format this week of this site!!!

      we went to macau on sunday. a sweet and charming little island off hong kong. we actually had to go--because i did not get my visa processed in time and so you have to enter and leave the country (macau is china) before you can get your visa stamped.  so off we went to macau--which was orginally a portuguese colony that was key in the trading of spices and goods between mainland china, japan and india. it is amazing because it still holds the charm and elegance of a small european village--just with most of the residents now speaking cantonese!  you start the day on a turbo-jet boat and take a 55  minute cruise to this island. china sea on one side of the boat--outerlaying islands on the other--not much of a view to speak of. then macau appears in the windows of the boat--promissing an interesting day.  see pix at:  http://www.fotolog.net/ardenwoods  so in a few words, macau is basically:  a 15th century church a fort winding streets filled with merchants some amazing portuguese food (fernando's in particular) a las vegas like gambling section  we made it to all but the gambling. we had heard horror stories of how disgusting the inside of the casinos are--and garth not being a super duper gambler like his wife--opted out. fearfully, i might find myself alone in macau one afternoon gambling my allowence!  i had never had portuguese food--which is something that i will probably begin to dream about in my over-dumplinged and dim sum state. (don't get me wrong--i am not complaining about dim sum!!!)  so we tripped around macau all day--stuffed ourselves silly at fernando's and snuggled back up on the turbo jet for our ride home. it rained most of the day, with me hiding under an umbrella (see goodmorning wan chai) which prompted me to make an appointment to get my hair straightend as soon as esprit hair salon opened on monday morning!

      so, we are in page one last night--an art/desgin/architecture bookstore that is really, just quite too much! garth and i became a bit overwhelmed by the glutton factor of too many books, too little time. we had agreed on a purchase of rem koolhaas-- s.m.l.xl but had too many parcels to carry on the train..so next time. we won't have to plot to steal tony's now!  so anyways...we are in page one and keane begins to play--highly reccomended if you like verve, oasis, etc. etc.   keanemusic.com/  the world has shrunk and is now available in hong kong also! keane who made their debut on morning becomes eclectic back in october has now creeped into my world and my new favorite book store.  i have also started a fotolog page:  http://www.fotolog.net/ardenwoods/  it will be a photo diary of our travels in asia...nothing too earthshattering yet...just a few pix snapped.

      a drizzly sunny humid morning awaits me on the street. my main concern today is finding a flat iron. either that or finding someone to straighten my hair! this could be maddening for a girl who never made peace with her curly hair.   in true nysha fashion, i have our door-man "steve" on the hunt for favorable locations to find this contraption that will keep my hair straight and flat! i did an experiment yesterday with my old blow dryer and it blew up promptly--had the adaptor but not the converter. key is the converter! i guess i missed that lesson in 10th grade science about wattage and electricity and well--it is just different in different places.   maybe i should just get a perm and really curl my whole head out--none of this half curl half frizz thing...just a big bozo the clown head of red-hair. lovely.
