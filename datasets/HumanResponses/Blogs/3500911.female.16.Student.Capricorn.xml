      can't believe it..i'm falling ill so easily..niwae, i dunno why but nowadays, every single thing that he does, i kinda get annoyed with it..i'm confused myself..it's like when he tells me stuffs, i will feel unhappy about it..especially when he's telling me that he's working on that particular day or going out with his friends..am i being possessive? i really think so you know..i don't knowlah..maybe it's because of the fact that i haven't been meeting up with him for quite some time..like tomorrow for instant..i was thinking of going out with him with our nice2 baju..but only just now that he told he's not working tomorrow because he's going out with his friends..and i thought he was going to ask me out or what..haiz~ and his &nbsp;manager kept on asking him to work on the days that he's not even supposed to work! my goodness...like i said, i can't say or do anything..later he thinks what pula kan..dunnolah..kadang2 bingit juga seh..i think i expec a lot from him that's why ah..oh well..

      hey..i can't believe that i didn't write in for so long..have been so busy..so many things have been going on..my mid-years were just over..i got back like econs and maths paper..i don't even know how to tell my parents about my results..geez..they are sure going to like chop off my head or something..(not literally of course!) niwae, i've been together with him for over 5 months now..nearing 6..so happy..but then, we just like quarrelled like on last Saturday..my goodness, it was horrible, terrible and everything that you can think of..but then, it's ok now..i mean, we talked it out even though in anger..i found out from his mum that he was actually crying..goodness..because you know why? he was afraid that he's gonna lose me again..haiz~ but don't worry, i'm still here...honestly, i think it has only brought us closer together you know..even though now we seldom get to meet, but like the saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder..and i think it's damn true..hehe.. well, the debate competition is just round the corner like on this coming saturday..and guess what? i'm in the team! it's quite shocking actually..didn't expect it but at least i'm not speaking..for such a major competition like this, i'm just not up to it..the team consists of me, Sanah, Alvyn, Edward and Sadhana..we can do it guys! i'm sure..:)
