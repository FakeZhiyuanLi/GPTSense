      *************************************** ***************************************   May 21, 2004 (Uncherished Former Friend's Name Here)  Dear Former Uncherished Friend, (Insert His/Her Real Name)  As per customary terms of long-standing relationships among friends like us, I hereby give 2 weeks notice of my intention to leave this friendship. My final day of being your friend will be Friday, June 4, 2004.  I want to thank you for all that you have done for me during our time together. It has been a pleasure knowing you and learning from the rich resource of your ideas.   It is now time for me to move on and I have accepted a position with another friend. This decision was not an easy one and took a lot of consideration. However, I am confident that this new role represents a positive move towards fulfilling my future goals.   I wish you and your family continued success and once again, would like to thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life.   If there is anything I can do to assist the smooth transition of replacing me, please let me know.   Cordially, Yor Name Here

          Stop whatever it is that seems so important. Are you going to school? Skip class. Are you going to work? Call in sick. Do you or does someone you love currently have a medical emergency requiring urgent care as a matter of life or death? Wait a while. Whether you are reading this from New York City (Vincent - what's up man?) or Georgia or South Korea, Japan, The Philippines, Osteoporosis, Halitosis, or elsewhere, you need to find this drink and take it home and drink it ALL day long. A friend from Juarez, Mexico told me about this before I went to New York. He said I would like it. He was right. I should be doing homework right now, but this is a lot more interesting. Besides, I am setting the example for you to be irresponsible. Let that special person in your life down, and go ahead and search for this drink no matter what the consequences.

                I took a break from studies tonight and shot these pics on my way out of Barnes & Noble here in Scottsdale, Arizona.  The first one is a pic of stairs - yes, stairs. There is something about stairs that I find very cool.  The second is kids playing in a water fountain park in Kierland Commons. It's unfortunate that the two children that happen to be looking into the camera appear to be possessed by satan. Or maybe I just need to read about shutter controls and red-eye reduction.  The pic just above is RA Sushi, a Japanese Restaraunt. Is anyone surprised that I included something Asian in this post? For sure I am going to a Japanese restaraunt for lunch tomorrow. I've been eating grapefruit and eggplant all day and if I do this again tomorrow, I may, as they say, go postal.

         I found  urlLink this music  accidentally by clicking onto this website. (Allow it to load for a minute or so and you will begin to hear it)  I know this is piano, but I do not what piece this is particularily. I would also like to know what genre this is. I asked the website host, but my Korean is a little weak. I tried to ask, "This is great music. What is the name of it?" But I think I might of said, "I like potato pancakes after a rainy spring morning."   If you can educate me, I would be greatful. Either leave a comment or email me at: abesavona@yahoo.com  I'll probably post one more set of pics before going out of town, but I will try to post several of pics from Manhattan next week.

       urlLink The Japanese Friendship Garden  is located at 1125 N. 3rd Ave. Phoenix, AZ. (602) 256-3204  If you have a chance to visit a JFG, it will be well worth the effort. Below are some actual pics from Japan itself. You'll need to pan your browser from side to side to see the entire width of the pics. I'll be taking more (of my own) pics this week and posting. Enjoy.

          It's great to finally have my blog back up and running. I needed a break and this time around, I am doing this blog very differently. I am going to post a LOT of pics, mostly pics that I shoot. It will be a while before the site is fully functional and interactive- I have to re-sign up for some of the bells and whistles from the previous site and do a bunch of html to get this looking good again. But for starters here are some pics of the Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. I went there today for the first time and it was INCREDIBLE! In a week or so I will be posting a bunch of pics - live from NYC. Enjoy the pics!

           urlLink AUDIO    Today, someone from China was asking me about the difference between "supper" and "dinner." I told her that they are regional varieties and both have the same meaning. The dictionary gives a slight variation, with supper being more of a snack or light evening meal, and dinner as the main mid-day or evening meal. I grew up saying dinner. My sister, raised in the same home as me, says "supper."   I decided to take a break from my studies tonight and came across this website. You can play audio clips of accents of American English from around the country. (click on "AUDIO" above and download the small audio clip/s on the webpage)  This kind of thing has always been very interesting to me. I'm off to enjoy my.. dinner.

         Incredible study! When we realize that all people have a built-in potential, we no longer get frustrated with them for being different than others; we understand who and what they are and can utililize their unique gifts. This read is definitely not for the casual reader;  urlLink this is one of the most intellectually piercing books  I've read about human nature and potential. This gets behind the facade of what we so often read in cliche-laden business books of today.

         Remember Tab soda? I can remember how huge this was in the late 70's. The whole saccharine scare kind of killed Tab, but Coca Cola still makes it and it's available in limited quantities throughout the US. I think I'm going to grab one next time I go to the store.

         I don't think it matters if you have a grade school education or a doctorate; this book can help anyone! I have read Good To Great by  urlLink Jim Collins  (parts of it many times) and it is THE book I recommend to anyone who seeks to improve themselves and/or their work environment and productivity.  In my observations, I've noticed that there is one major diffeence between people who are great and those who are good. Great people don't settle for good; they are never satisfied with riding the train given to them by life - they build their own train, their own tracks, and fill the compartments with people who challenge them to much higher heights of excellence than they currently know. As my dad told me so often as I was growing up, "Spend your time with people who are better than you." He meant that I should be around people who would challenge me to new levels - levels I didn't know existed. That was some of the best advice I'd ever received. I now make it a point to challenge myself in how and where I spend my time, because what we are exposed to today shapes who we will become tomorrow. I can't imagine going through life with an ordinary, "get by" way of thinking. I am working on going from Good To Great each day. Pave your own path! Get this book and let it make you better!

Can you blame them?  ;-) I've been so busy with school and life, but I will try to post at least weekly from now on.  Have you had an  urlLink afternoon delight  lately?  urlLink Check this out  and click on "Afternoon Delight" under "videos." Hilarious!

         (Above: Fernando toward the end of his amazing career)  When I was a young kid, I got caught up in  urlLink Fernandomania  and soon became a life-long fan of Fernando Valenzeula, the greatest pitcher Mexico has ever produced. Fernando is now a bit more accessible because he does the Spanish language radio broadcasts for the Los Angeles Dodgers. One weekend I am going to LA to meet the man I listened to on the radio as a little kid and still admire.  Hasta luego.
