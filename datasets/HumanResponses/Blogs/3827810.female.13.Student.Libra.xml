      it just occured to me.. that what makes me happy.. is what isnt always true.. its often something made up.. but im not saying that things that are real dont make me happy.. on friday.. naoemi saw that my necklace hook was at the front of my neck.. so she fixed it.. and said.. "someones thinking about you".. i wondered where she got that from.. and i asked her.. and she told me that when the nacklace hook is at the front of your neck.. it means that someone was thinking about you.. i thought about it for a while.. and as stupid as this may sound.. now.. i constantly check my necklace.. and when the hook is at the front.. i have this feeling of contentment.. it seems as if these made up things were made to make us happy.. like the tooth fairy.. and santa clause.. we know that they are fake.. yet belive in them just for our own contentment.. dont destroy the happiness.. believe in the fantasy things.. believe in old sayings.. i dont know if it will work for you.. but for me.. they give me a feeling of contentment and happiness..  _______ ______ _____ ____ ___ __ _  feeling 50-50 happy.. close enough to neutral.. listening to no matter what (boyzone).. currently wearing 14 bracelets.. thinking about "him".. cant wait until tonights night rally.. cant wait to see my youth group and my friends from last years hillsong conference..  _______ ______ _____ ____ ___ __ _  NOTICE: "passionate" night rally starts today..!! go jesus..!!

      longing for satisfaction.. not the kind of satisfaction that can be achieved my "love making".. but the satisfaction achieved by self contentment.. success.. and loving that special someone.. and knowing that they love you.. but this satisfaction seems so hard to achieve.. no matter how hard i may try.. i cannot feel the satisfaction i wish to feel.. but this "longing" burdens me.. yet helps me up when i fall.. restores the passion i once had.. and helps me to carry on.. helping me persue what i was made to do.. some may think that this "longing" is longed by those who are depressed.. let down.. and sad.. but weirdfully.. i am not.. "i am happy.. just not satisfied".. this may be the most contradictory sentence in the world.. so hard to comprehend.. but to me.. it  makes so much sense.. but how can i feel satisfaction when all im left with is confusion..?? was love made to create pain..?? im just so overwhelmed by all the concepts of love.. im being consumed by them as they pass by.. i dont know who im falling for.. i dont know what to do.. could i go back to my first love (after god).. or the newly presented love of my life..?? or neither..?? im too scared to lose them.. im scared that im going to lose my friends as well.. im in the phase of my life where it seems as if im falling apart from those who i love the most.. now is the time where i feel i need them the most.. but now is the time where i feel as if they dont need me.. im loosing that confidence in which i know that my friends will always be there.. im that person sitting outside of the circle.. that person who doesnt get invited to the parties.. that singular person that left out.. but all i can do now.. is pray for those who i love the most.. and trust in god.. depending on his great love.. to restore back unto me.. the joy of my salvation.. and the joy of life..  _______ ______ _____ ____ ___ __ _  lord.. i come to you now in prayer.. i pray for those who i love.. my friends.. my family.. the people around me.. i pray that you may restore back to me the joy of my salvation.. the joy of being alive.. and the joy of knowing that my friends will always be there.. i pray that you may guide them and protect them.. although they may not trust or want me.. i pray that you let them know that i love.. trust.. and care for them.. lord.. give all of my friends a heart of worship and forgiveness.. lord.. i pray that you make me complete and fill me with your awsome love.. lord.. i love you.. and i thank you for all that you have given on to me.. i pray this through jesus' name.. amen..
