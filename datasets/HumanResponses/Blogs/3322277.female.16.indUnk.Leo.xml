      Have you ever told someone how you feel and thought that they felt the same way, but then found out they didnt. that sucks, i have never been in this kind of a situation and i have no idea how to handle it.maybe im not trust worthy or there is something i did wrong to make this persn feel this way.i donno, funny how fast you go from happy to alone huh?

      I hate the fact that when you tell one person something in coudersport that they feel obligated to spout off at the mouth and release that information to anyone they feel needs to know....and for all you people like that i wish for you to go to hell.oh and then you get these certain people that have like split personalities or somthing...i mean they tell you how much they cant stand a person and then they are that persons best freind the next seconed, when they have said some pretty mean things about that person and talk shit about that person then i think that they also need to go to hell or either a mental institution because thats playing with someones head.so for all you people like this i think you need to get your shit strait!!

      jimmy is not a bad guy ...he's right all's you need is some time.it's obvious that you two still care for eachother but things do change and sometimes thats not a bad thing.you are still young and i personally think (even though you didnt ask for my opinon)that you need to try to be with new people and see what its like.being friends with my brother is definatly going to take some time because of the feelings that you guys have had or still have for eachother.so dont push and even though its hard have patience.it will all be ok.

      i had a really good hangover yesterday and so i decided to get some sleep and mike and jimmy were going to go to my cousins house for a while.well mike told me he'd be back at 6:30 and we would get ready and go to the drive in...well jimmy comes and barge's into my room at like 6:00 and screams " DONT FREAK OUT OK", by about that time i realized mike wasnt with him and something had to be wrong with him. so anyways jimmy tells me that on the way back mike hit a wash away thing in the road and flew over his handel bars, hit the guard rail ,wich tore out a chunk of his leg, and then he flew into some rocks on the other side of the rail.i was like omg where is he...where is my baby.jimmy then tells me that he is at the e.r. and they were going to take care of it!!all's i could think about was i needed to find a way there.so we called mike's mom and me jimmy mike's mom and brother headed up to the e.r. of course i was still freaking out.by the time we got there he was in room 4 laying there making joke's.and by this time i was thanking god that he didnt hit something else, like his head or something (perverts lol).because there is always that posibility that if he hit something else he could have bled to death.i was so worried, i've already felt what it feels like to loose someone you love and i couldnt handle loosing another one.but he was ok and thats all that matters.god he's brave.i would have passed out if it was me lol.i love you mike.

      Ok sam you wanna talk shit....how bout how you disrespected me and my father.we gave a you a decent place to live and you cant even get decent grades in school.its not like he asked the world from you and he never asked you to pay him anything.the only thing he wanted was for you to have good grades and make something of yourself.i was the one who asked my dad for permission to have you live here therefor you became my responsibility thats why i dont care what jimmy and naya and christa do.oh and so you hate me wel fuck you i dont give a damn!!and i can say i dont miss you.i dont care about anything having to do with you.i hope you turn out like what your leaning for ....a bum with no education and you work at costa's for the rest of your life.if thats what you want fine. oh and i think that you need to take a reality check with jessica because i didnt kick you out , DID I!!no jessica came in there and told you that she thought it would be better if you left.im not going to lie i was going to tell you to move out but i hadnt made a real dicision yet...untill jessica begged us to let her tell you that you needed to leave.yeah thats right jessica was sick of your shit too but i guess you guys talked that over found that shit out when i came home.i dont walk all over anyone, bitch.alls i tried to do with you was help a girl who was falling downhill and became friends with her along the way.you walked all over us when you took living with us like it was a free ride.Oh and by the way cassy has nothing to do with this you guys are over and done with and thats that so get over it.you guys not being friends anymore has nothing to do with me,so shut up.you chose to accept me as a friend thats not my fault and i dont give a flying fuck what you stopped doing for me that my friend was also your choice.i also wish nothing but the worst for you.you really know how to take something that somone has givin you and WALK ALL OVER IT.my dad nor i didnt need your shit.what were we thinking.i thought that if we could help you then maybe your life would be better but you stayed at a downhill pace ...not to mention lying to me and him about shit.dont even tell me that you didnt because i have proof of you lying.im glad i made you cry.you always tell people that you dont want thier pitty...sounds to me like you do.go complain some more at group in school sam....go make everyone feel sorry for you.
