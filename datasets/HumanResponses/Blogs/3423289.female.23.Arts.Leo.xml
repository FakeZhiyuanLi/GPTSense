      Again sorry for the typos.  More on the uses on pink in  Egypt. I saw a store display with manneguins all in pink and pink scarves over there heads last night when we ate at this really cafe in in Old Cairo. It was so nice becuase al;l these famous writers have been there. I love reading something and then experienceing it. Or at least what the author experienced. So I have also seen lots of little boys in pink and a lot of the male artist in the Alexandria used pink in their work. Way to go Egyptian men! I talked to my new friends about it and pink i sjust any color to them. This is my gola for the US. I don't want pink to be used as a harmful gender color.   I have noticed that in general Egyptians are not afriad of color. Maybe only America is chromophobic (afraid of color). I will discuss this more when I get back.

      Wowy Zowy. Today was jam packed! Echo and I had a peaceful sleep in the hotel. However, Marcy and Sharon were awoken by a man coming in their room at 2:00 am. We think he was just at the wrong room, but still weird. I don't care about th hotel, all that matters is that i have a beautiful view of the Mediterian Sea from my window. Like I said, paradise.  So first our new guide Marian, who is really sweet and wheres these great blue business like skirt suits, gave my Egyptian coins. One of them has a whole so I will totally where it as jewelry. We went to this beautiful Roman ampitheater. Then we had one of the highlights of our ever exciting Egyptian journey. At the first mosque we went to their was a group of older women in the mosque with two small children a girl and a boy and at cat. They meet every Friday to chat. They were so kind to us. they thought we looked like, get this, Hollywood movie stars! The little girl was so cute. I gave her and her brother German Euros and Echo gave her a bracelet and I also gave her some children's hair clips that I had gotton for myself. Our guide tranlated for us. It was such a wonderful experience to talk to these women and lay with the children. The little girl didn't want us to leave.   We then went to another mosque that had beautiful yellow and purple glass stars and silver domes. every mosque is so beautiful and differnt in its own way. My favorite part of visiting the mosques is taking off my shoes. I love to be barefoot and I think that it is just more respectful.   We had lunch at a place that had tradional Egyptian food and almost all of the food was vegetarian. Marcy was kind enough to give me the menu, which has dolphins on it. I believe Jacque Cousteau looked for the lost city of Atlantis over here in this part of the sea.   Next we saw a pink bridge, beautfiul gardens, a pinkish lighthouse and the presidential palace. I don't remeber the name of this place. It was really beautiful the intermixing of the pink of the constructions with the blue of the water and sky worked very well. Mohammed our driver was then kind enough to to inivite us to have rice pudding with him. He is such a sweet man. I mean hey we did smoke shisha with him. This was hands down the best pudding that I have had here.    Bibliotheca Alexandrina  was our final destination. The building alone is an amazing feet of architecture. Countries from all over the world helped to rebuild this one ancient libary of the ancient world. This library is so futuristic. It also has art exhibitions and a planetium with the history of science in the region of the world musuem.   After the library Marcy and Echo went in search of a cyber caffe and I went of adventuring by myself. I had a n hour and a half to spend before I went to see a show at the museum called the "Cosmic Voyage." I found a cyber cafe called the Tan Tan. Of course Ezzeldein's internet cafe that I went to last night is the best internet cafe that I have been to in all the owrld and i have been to internt cafes in 9 differnt countries. Then on my way back I met some interseting men who wanted to take their picture with me by the sea. I would have but I was in a hurry. One guay Sharif is coming to the US this summer so he will contact me when he gets there.   Cosmis Voyage was amazing!!! I have not been in a planetaium since I was little. The IMAX film on a sphereical screen that sctretched over our heads like the sky covered everything of the externak frontier spave to the internal frontier a drop of water. They showed a pink sunset and pink neitrons! Thwen I saw this unglaublich art exhibit outside of the theater room. The walls are metal silver speakers and the ceiling is covered with shades of blue-violet flashing lights. The whole instillation is ever changing and will run for a thousand years! It is baout time and the exploration of" going beyond human." Every person for the next thousand years will see different light patterns and hear differnt music.The artist is Jem Finer and he says humans must "think out of time." Google him too. Well I am off to go to sleep. This has been an wunderbar day. I am in a hurry so I don't have time to proof read. So I will do that later. Call me the Princess of Typos! *:)

      I mentioned Mehndi in an earlier post. For those of you that do not know what it is or have questions about its name and what it is refered to across the world here is an explanation provided by a Mehndi artist.   Mehndi is the traditional art of adorning the hands and feet with a paste made from the finely ground leaves of the henna plant. The term refers to the powder and paste, and the design on the skin, as well as the party or ceremony. Henna is a small shrub called hawsonia inermis, and is also know as Henne, Al-Khanna, Al-henna, Jamaica Mignonette, Mendee, Egyptian Privet, and Smooth Lawsonia. Henna grows in hot climates and is found in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Persia, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan and other North African, Asian and Middle Eastern countries. The leaves, flowers, and twigs are ground into a fine powder, then mixed with hot water. Various shades are obtainable by mixing with the leaves of other plants, such as indigo. Tea, coffee, cloves, tamarind, lemon, sugar, and various oils are also used to enhance the colour and longevity of design.

      Where to start. Ok, quick review first. We saw Coptic Cairo. It was very nice and serene. This was our last day with Momduah, which was very sad because he is such a good person and guide. I learned so much from him about history and art. And he made a special trip for me to Zeitoun Coptic Church. In 1968 after the 67 War, the Virgin Mary appeared to the people and helped lift their spirits and fill their hearst with hope. Very beautiful.  I bought a glow-in-the-dark Mary to put between two ankhs. She is so a  version of Isis. Way to go Goddess Mary.   Then we ate on the fish boat which is a boat on the Nile. It was very nice.   And now for the beginning of some very exciting happenings. Marcy's friends took us around old town Cairo and we saw amazing, powerful, political, art that matters, Egyptian modern art. I was really impressed. And last night was our last night in Giza. What a way to go out. And last night was Uncle Traveling Leo's first night out on the town. He will post some comments. He loved the art! We saw an instillation using silver plastic, it was about creating kinetic space through the utilization of light. We saw amazing postmodern paintings about the landscape, gender, history and whimsy and of course purely formal concerns. We really didn't see very much sculpture. But the 2-D work was phenomenal!  I have had an a stroke of brilliance for a future course of action that I must take when i get back. There is this program here where Cairo artists work with Sudanese refugees and teach them art to help them learn the language and express themselves. The children's art was so sophisticated. I bought a purple elephant painting. The proceeds go to the children. I would like to do this for refugee children in Boise. Maybe this will be part of my social dialectical art. Art that matters and art that makes a direct difference is how I want art to be. At least for myself, just wait for my Manifesto, coming this fall to a place in Boise near you.  So then we went pack to pack. I started writing in my journal and in order to keep myself awake I went to the lobby. I heard these two men (young handsome men) and a beautiful woman speaking German. so naturally my Gelfling German sensitive ears perked up. So when the blonde walked by me I said hello to him and German, and the rest is history. They invited me for a drink and I found out the the men were Swiss and the girl was Italian. We discussed politics. I love German speakers they are so aware and smart. I can't wait to live in the German speaking world and have these conversations all the time. They were very impressed that an American was in a Muslim Country. Then their two Palestinian friends joined us. These two girls had studied in Germany and spoke German. I got to speak German for five hours! I am so jazzed! We also went dancing and we drank a lot. The German way you know. They paid for everything because they said I was the best American experience they had ever had Wooooohoooooooo. Call me a cultural Ambassador! We exchanged info and I am welcome to stay with them in Switzerland anytime!  So know I am at a wonderful internet cafe in Alexandria. The nicest man helped me find this. I am adventuring on my own. Alexandria is very beautiful, it is paradise. We saw one of the seven wonders of the ancient world today, the Light House of Alexandria. Wow. I love this city, it is more peaceful than Cairo or Giza and it is so artful. No signs of pink but the sublime blue of the Med Sea makes up for. While actually I did see two big pin billboards with brides, one was was Western style and the other was Middle Eastern. We also went to the museum and saw sculptures of Cleopatra!!! And we went into catacombs.  Echo and I have this suite in out hotel. Very nice. So I went out to tour the city and got some amazing music and met a very nice music man and a very nice men showed me to a cyber cafe and now I am writing here.  Oh by the way my new phrase is "chunky monkey!" Oh so today we had a new body guard. Mohammed. When I was shopping at the fortress I looked over and he was standing right by me all protective style. I totally felt like Princess Mia from the Princess Diaries and her body guard Lars. Mohammed wore mirror sunglasses, he was Mr..Cool. It is still weird getting use to all of the protection. Like I said before call me Madam president of Wangdoodleland, so much for Villa Incognito.   I should get going because it is getting late. Guten Nacht.  UNCLE TRAVELING LEO:  I was so excited to leave the hotel finally! The art was so wonderful and I had so much fun with those Swiss guys and the ladies. They thought I was super cool. So the art was wonderful, but I must admit that the little bit of sculptures that I saw were not as good. I prefer Melody's. I totally want to help her with her refugee work with children. Well I am sleepy to more later.

      Today we saw Islamic Cairo. We saw lovely mosques. The highlight of the tour were the Ottoman houses. They felt like palaces and they had amazing architecture and lush  gardens. Some of the ceilings had colored glass imbedded in them which made the rooms glow with a magickal aura. We also went to the Suke (sp?) which is like a bazaar. I found wonderful presents for my family and some pink belly dancing clothes. That type of dancing so suits by body and spiritual side. We also went to the famous Naguib Mahfouz Cafe. He is a famous Egyptian writer. I strongly recommend his novels.   So yesterday I forgot to mention some very interseting cultural happenings. On ethe Nile cruise last night there were female Asian tourists, I believe they were Japanese, who bought tourists veils to dress like the locals. This is a very intersting cultural dynamic with orientialsm refering to the Middle East and Americans refering to Asia as the Orient and Asians as Orientals. The women were acting like the veils were dress up.  Oh Echo got her first henna Mehindi deisgn and Cleocowtra recieved one as well. Cleocowtra was also asualted last night on the cruise by the pink male belly dancers dresses as a horse. It was tramatic for her but at least she got to belly dance with me.   So we went to McDonalds tonight. I got a Happy meal. They were out of the Barbies (Sorry Nick). Mcdonalds are intersting social places for families. I met two men from Sariovo there. We have one day left in Cairo and then we are heading to Alexandria (I hope we see some Cleopatra stuff there).  I am going to miss our tour guide Mumduah. He is really kind and knows everything about Egypt. He is Coptic and I am hoping we go to the Zeitoun churge tomorrow. This is were the Virgin Mary appeared in 1967. ( As you know Mary to me was a powerful mother goddess figure coopopted by Christianity.)  Oh I almost forgot to metnion my most brilliant idea thus far... I want to get Modern Bob to allow Marcy, Echo and I (by the way thanks you two for having me be a priestess in the cow cult) to have a Cleocowtra art exhibition at the Flying M. We can have the photos and an instillation with a cow alter with Hathor the Egyptian cow goddess. Trust me Cleocowtra is one phenomenial cow. We would then donate the profits to a good animal orginizations that helps rescue animals.  Ok in the spirit of the always hip writings of Mia from the Prinicces Diaraies I have decided to make a top ten list:   Melody's top ten list of my spectacular observations of Egypt (so far)... *:)  In no particular order, except for number one.  10. The site of the pyramids with the modern landscape, so ancient future. 9.   All the ancient goddess art. Early feminism at work 8.  The affection among men, they hold hands and dance together. Very beautiful. 7.  The extreme drving, despite the cracyness of the abscbnce of trafiic lights the drivers function  very well admist the chaos. 6. The Nile, The Nile, The Nile. Need I say more. 5. The altruistic nature of Egyptian Hospitality.  4. The vegetarian cuisine. Thank goddess that I am not living off of green salad. 3.  The beauty of the Arabic langauge. 2.  The amount of pink that I see men wearing. 1. Of course this one is a given... The ubiquitous appearnce of pink!

      My amazing performance art friend Barbara Martin Sparrow wrote this for me after reading my blog.. She is also a pink lady and last semster she did this M.A. performance called if I remember correctly "Pink Lady All Alone." She is a fellow super herione of reclaiming pink. You go girl.  It is very beautiful and heartfelt. Thank you my dear *:)  The blackened stage starts with a rosy glow, as dawn floods the land, turning it all a beautiful pink.  Humming- the princess glides across the stage- traveling towards stage right.  Her scarlet robes stand out- forming a triangle shape as she glides along, like a pyramid. She hums the chorus of the Valkyries as she floats along.  She whips of f a black velvet drape, covering a huge bronze sphinx with glowing eyes.  Stroking its chin- it begins to purr as cats of every shape and color saunter onto the stage and loll around.       The princess raises her arms to the sky and a silver orb moon ascends.  Touching it-the orb turns into a golden sun that the princess takes and spins and rolls around.  Placing the sun back in the sky the princess glides down to the sphinx- petting it and whispering in its ear as it purrs.  Suddenly she screams and extracts a nose mask out of her pocket and places it across the sphinx's nose.    Moving quickly, she crosses downstage and throws back a small black drape in front of the sphinx, revealing a Kentucky Fried Chicken Bucket.  The princess pours out the bucket- finding a stream of sand and not chicken.  The princess smashes the greed of corporate America as she smashes the bucket with her foot.  All grows black- with flashes of magenta lightning flashing on the dream/stage.               We miss you, have fun and slay the bad dragons.                                                                   Love, Barbara and Roger.

      Yesterday we saw the Cairo Museum. It is not as overwhelming as the Louvre but is is still quite big. I saw two amazing statues of Hatshepsut. She was the female ruler of Egypt. I just love cross dressing rulers! Our tour guide Momduah is really knowledgeable. After that we went to the Citadel and the Mohammed Ali Mosque. I was dressed modestly enough, but others had to put green robes on. I have some issues with the double standard modesty thing with Islam. However, the mosque was beautiful. Momduah was so kind and he got us each a perfume bottle. Mine is sky blue. I fell like the tour guides and drivers are some of the kindest and most generous people that I have ever met. My stomach decided to rebel against me and I stayed in that night with Uncle Traveling Leo. We wrote over 30 postcards and watched the German channel. We saw the Blues Brothers II dubbed over in German with Arabic subtitles! What a cultural exchange huh.  So today we went to Port Said and and saw the Suez canal. We were looking across the canal to Asia. We will be headed that way in a couple of days. So on this trip I will have been to four continents in two weeks!!!!!!!!:) Unglaublich!  We felt like royality or presidents because in the city we had like four police and military escorts and a bodyguard. No joke. They are being over protective just incase. I have the pictures and Marcy has the film footage to prove it. By the way I so love Marcy and Echo and Sharon. My tummy was being a ratfink this morning and they were all so kind and caring. It meant a great deal. Anyway we even got a special dinning area and I had really good soup that help my cranky tummy. My batteries died in my camera and Mohamed was kind enough to find me new ones.  Then when we got back we went to a Shisha place with Ramadan(bodyguard) and Mohamed(driver). Shisha is like the pipe that the caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland smokes, and I tried my first smoke ever. It was pretty good and it tasted like cottoncandy.   Then we went on a dinner cruise of the Nile. The Nile is so sublime. It was the Nile Crystal ship. Very magickal. I even belly danced and their were two male belly dancers wearing pink. Marcy was wearing a pink belt today but she said it was "pink by accident." I cannot stress to all of you how much pink I am seeing.  Right now I am recharging my cyborg feminist energy at the cyber cafe a couple blocks from our hotel.

      Hello this is Uncle Traveling Leo here. I finally got out of the Giza hotel to write my feeling about being in Egypt. First of all for those of you who have not had the pleasure of meeting me I am Melody's pink and yellow lion. She saved me from the evil Walmart last year. They were going to toss me out. She named me after a character on Fraggle Rock last summer when I toured Europe with her. I really miss her pink hair and I wish she would dye it back. Oh I digress.   So I guarded the hotel today while she went to the Pyramids and the Sphinx. I started reading her Tom Robbins book "Still Life with Woodpecker." I like Tom Robbins but he doesn't ever write about lions. Lions are the king of beasts. In this book Ralf Nader is a sex symbol. I didn't see that coming. Melody met Nader last year and talked about the book with him, he signed a book for her "For Justice."  I made a new friend with with Echo's Cleocowtra; she was once a got milk cow and now she is the Queen of Egypt.   Oh did I tell you I went to Amsterdam again? We went through there on the way to Egypt. very nice city but I could tell it was hard for Melody to be so close to Germany and not be able to got there. I can tell she loves Egypt. She actually rode a camel today!Well I need a cat nap more later.

      Habibis (dear ones I am learning some Arabic),  Egypt is amazing. It is so colorful. There is pink everywhere and men are not afraid to wear pink! The food is vegetarian friendly. Yesterday was our first day in Cairo although our hotel is in Giza. We just walked around trying to shake off the jetlag. We went to some amazing bookstores. We had coffee at a café by the Nile.The people are so nice, they ask where we are from and tell us how much they love Americans, just not our government, I agree with that. Although Echo and I have already gotten marriage proposals. One man offered me a lifetime supply of papyrus and another offered me ten thousands postcards. No thanks.  Today we went to the sphinx and the pyramids. We got to climb inside of the pyramids and poor Marcy bumped her head (she is ok). The sphinx faces a KFC, isn't that horrible. It's head is made of stone so it can't look away from the chicken house.   The Egyptians are kind and consiiterate that when we go into a resteraunt they switch the music to "American" music. Which consists of a hundred different Musak versions of "Feelings." We want to listen to Egyptian music, thank you.   They are worried about Americans' safety so we have a police escort that our travel company sent along. They yelled at cars to move over so our van could pass through and blaring their sirens. They were having to much fun. We felt a little rockstarish. But it was ironic for protection sake because they were drawing attention to us being from the US. I have met many German tourists and one Arab cab driver that couldn't speak English but he could speak German. I knew my German would come in handy. Klar!  The weather is very nice here. It is unusually cool.Of course echo and I are waking up at four in the morning suffocating in our hotel room because our window won't open.   Tomorrow we are going to the Egyptian museum. I can't wait. We are also going to go to modern art museums. Did you know that the ancient Egyptians thought of cobras as females?    Oh I brought Uncle Traveling Leo along and Echo and Marcy have Cow. I gave Cow a makeover today and she has been reborn as Cleocowtra. (These are stuffed animals.)  Watch for my upcoming BLOG...  Yours in adventure travel,  Melody Isisler  Thaw with her gentle persuasion is more powerful than Thor with his hammer. The one melts, the other breaks into pieces.                                                                                                             -Henry David Thoreau

      Here is another beautiful email from my friend Emile. Even though he is a hydrologist he has some poetic gifts. He is saving the world through his knowledge of water.  Hey sista pink   is you back from the brink of the mauvestern wave....  halelujah haleluja holy mother goddess of all sacred grace and beauty, it won't be long before the tranformation of dignity, creativity and the open space of the soul have reached the ultimate destiny of the ecuemenical divine of which we are all so intimately a part of due to the pink persuation.  Blessings on your journeys, merry meet merry part and merry meet again!

      Please stay tuned to hear all about my misadventures in the tree Egyptian Hotels, the plain rides and my hike up Mt. Sinai. Also due to some events that happened while I was in Egypt with Melody I have decided to write a manifesto against animate chauvinism!!! It will focus on the importance of inanimate life. Just because I am a stuffed animal doesn’t mean that I am not real and important. So if you are guilty of animate chauvinism take a moment to consider the importance of inanimate object beyond a utilitarian sense.

      Ok so on Monday I had one of the most fantastic days of my life. Well maybe I am exaggerating, but it was pretty amazing. I snorkeled in the Red Sea for five hours. I swam with the most brilliantly colored fish I have ever seen and I swam around coral reef. For an artist the visual stimulus was positively over whelming. It was truly a magical experience. And I only turned a little pink. If Sharon hadn’t reminded me I would have totally forgotten about the religious significance of the not so Red Sea. Upon that recollection I tried in vein to part the sea. Oh well, perhaps next time I found so many amazing sea shells and pieces of coral. One time while in the water I spied the most beautiful pink shell. I gently rolled it over to make sure that it was creature free, which it seemed to be. I promptly picked it up and upon inspection a hermit crab looked out and me as if to let me know that he is not done with his home. Needless to say I let him go back to the ocean. Of course two Egyptian men had witnessed the whole comedy of errors and were laughing hysterically at me. Bring in the clowns I am glad I made somebody laugh.   When I was resting on my beach share I had a fascinating conversation with an Egyptian man by the name of Sadek. He had a degree in sociology but working on the beach was better pay that working in academia. He kept telling me that all most Arab people want is to have a nice live and provide and take care of their families. He wanted me to share this with Americans. I will stress again that Egyptians are the kindest most caring and generous people that I have ever met. There is an abundance of altruism there. I really hope to have a home in Berlin and a home in Alexandria someday. My mind and body are in Germany and my heart is in Egypt. Sadek also wrote a beautiful poem in Arabic in my journal. It is a love poem that he wrote years ago. Arabic is such a melodic language. And by the way Melody is the same in Arabic and English! Oh and at this beach their restaurant was called Melodies Café! So not only is pink ubiquitous in Egypt the word melody is as well. So you all understand why I have such an overwhelming love for the land of the ancient future.   After a day at the eclectic blue and aqua beach we headed back to pull an “all nighter.” We drove to Mt. Sinai at 10pm and were set to hike up it at 12 or 2am.  We had two drivers for our van and the other driver not Mohamed drove like a bat out of hell. The drive was a little too exciting. We stopped by the side of the rode and gazed at the almost full moon. Our bodyguard pointed out down in the valley a Bedouin camp. Little did I know that I would be spending some time with some Bedouins soon.  We also had a very young and handsome tour guide named surprise surprise… Mohamed  (hence fourth known as Mohamed #2). He had left being a lawyer to be a tour guide and low and behold her spoke German!!! Who would have thought that I would encounter so much German in Egypt. I will got to practice my German in Egypt between the art show, the war memorial my partying with the Swiss men and our trilingual guide I really got to practice my Deutsch!!! Mohamed #2 told us that when we got to Saint Catherine’s Monastery that he hated climbing the mountain and that it was no fun.  Sharon rented a room because she was afraid the hike would be to difficult for her, she was right. I have never been on such a grueling hike. My feet screamed in pain over every rock and it was night so it was hard to see where we were going (we had flashlights). My poor feet the really had a hard time on this trip, between all the walking, the tortoise shell bug bites and I even cut them in the  Red Sea. For the climb I did bring Uncle Traveling Leo with me. He was exciting because he was being carried and didn’t have to walk up the hellish mountain (hellish that is a little bit ironic now isn’t it).  So by the time we reached the third rest stop I was done for. I left Marcy Echo and Mohamed #2 to continue the long trek (it turns out the never climbed the 700 stairs to the top either, that is one difficult climb). I had already climbed an hour and a half up the mountain. I really lucked out though because I ended up having such a wonderful time at this third rest stop. I was so exhausted and my stomach felt a little pyrotechnic again. The sweet man working there gave me some Egyptian tea with mint and my stomach for the first time on the trip felt like a million Egyptian pounds. He and some of the other worker there were Bedouin and I talked with them for hours about Bedouin life. I learned so much from them. Then an Egyptian tour guide came to stay the night in the small hut as well. He hated being a tour guide. I asked him what the Quran had to say about Moses and Mt. Sinai. He told me that (his name was also Mohamed) the Quran says that this is not the right mountain and that this place is just a silly tourist place. Being a pagan I really could care less about the misogynistic moment that Moses brought the world the Ten Commandments and started to make the world a blade society instead of a chalice society. Read the amazing Jewish feminist Dr. Judith Plaskow for her take on the moment in HIStory. However, I wanted to see a Sinai sunrise over a mountain. I have always been more awestruck by the sublimeness of nature than anything concerning humans. Ok, I digress… So then the kind Bedouin man gave me a pillow and blanket and some of the Bedouin men sang the most beautiful Bedouin night song, the only word that I understood was “habibi.” I awoke at dawn and went outside of the small rest area and sat with a white and a brown camel. I put Uncle Traveling Leo near the brown camel she gave him a sweet nuzzle. We all watched the majestic electrifying purple and lemon sunrise together. I thought about what the Sculpture Grad Student Matt Lawrence once told me about the purpose of humans on this earth was. Humans are the great interconnecters; humans have the propensity and purpose to integrate all inanimate and animate life on earth. It was a rather profound recollection that I had on Mt. Sinai. I believe that this will be in my manifesto. I profusely thanked the Bedouin men and tour guide for their kindness and started my long trek down the mountain. It was so nice to be alone on the mountain and go at my own pace. Also, I was experiencing the mountain in daylight now and was shocked to discover pink rocks everywhere. I am convinced that the mountain is made of some kind of pink granite. To think I slept on a pink mountain and didn’t even realize it! I got to Sharon’s hotel room at 7am. Marcy Mohamed #2 and Echo joined us at 8am. Then we toured St. Catharine’s Monastery (she was sainted because she refused to be a pagan and was brutally murdered. Why would a brutal death over the Goddess ever make since I think she was a little crazy or maybe the burning bush got to her). One room is filled with the skulls of monks and this monastery contains a very important library and the famous transfiguration of Christ mosaic. We also say the burning bush.   The we headed back to Cairo and Sharon and I flew out at 3am. We ended up going over 48 hours without sleep. The flights seemed to take an eternity. At one shop Sharon found a Veiled dark skinned Barbie like doll. She was very excited. On our flight to Minneapolis  the man that was sitting next to me was coming home from Iraq. He worked on a fuel convey. He showed us an amazing slide show on his digital camera. I decided to be objective and ask him questions about the current state of affairs there. He said about 95% of Iraqis’ were happy to have the US get rid of Saddam. However he stressed that the US should have left right after that and not continue to occupy Iraq. I gained a very interesting perspective from him. Well, I have a terrible cold now and I have completely lost my voice. But I would do it all again in a heart beat.   This was truly one of the most amazing experiences of my life … so far! Thank you all for sharing in my magical journey with me. I will keep posting on issues of pink. I wish you all much magic.

      Warning do to time constraints and sleepiness and excessive catch up this blog post might contain a plethora of silly typos. Trust in the fact that when I get back there will be a revised edition.  So we went to the World War II memorials outside of Alexandria. I hate anything having to do with war so I begrudgingly went along. Well, to my surprise it was worth the trip. We went to the German one first. By the way I am surrounded by German (keep reading to hear about the Bauhaus art exhibition). Then we saw the Italian one, which was very peaceful and had a beautiful view of the Mediterranean Sea and had a humming sound inside.  Next was the war museum which contained dioramas of different battles, there was actually a female soldier there, but she was a Nazi. I was most impressed. That was our last day with our guide Marian. She was very sweet. She was a hopeless romantic and a devote Coptic Christian with a very open mind. She was even kind enough to give me Egyptian coins. I hope to keep in contact with her because I have fallen in love with Alexandria. I am so taking my mother here.   So then we ate at Mohammed Ahmed restaurant. My tummy has had pyrotechnic action so I have been eating very little. Which is a bummer because Egyptian food is so good! But as my new friend Eslam told me you have to have a strong stomach for Egyptian food. Who would have thought.  Then Marcy and echo split from the heard to upload photos on the internet. I will post the address next. Thank Ms. Cyber Diva Marcy. So I went back to the one Light House of Alexandria to get some more gifts. And a very cool thing happened. Sharon went with me and so did our driver and bodyguard. I know driver bodyguard call me Madam President. I was getting my brother Shisha pipes when Mohammed our driver jumped in and starting arguing with the merchant over the price, I guess he knew that that man was over charging me because I was an American. The merchant told me that I have a very good friend. Mohammed really looks out for us. He is the safest driver in all of Egypt. And trust after experiencing the roads of Cairo that is saying something!!! We just met these New Yorkers that said it was like NY. HA!  So the night before Echo and Marcy and I all made a new friend with this group of three very nice guys. It is so easy to make friends here and the people are so genuine and altruistic. I think Egyptians are the kindest most caring people I have ever met! So the invited us to dinner the next night, which is the day I have been describing.  So Marcy and Echo got stuck at the cyber cafe so I met up with the guys. We took a taxi to meet M and E. The guys wanted to pay for everything. It is the Egyptian way, the good feminist in my wanted to argue but I wanted to be respectful. They are all my age. We met up with Marcy's friend Khalid (sp?) He is a lawyer here and such a funny guy. He taught me some good Islamic jokes. Watch out I am going to try and use them. We ate dinner and went and the he took us to a cafe the artists used to go to during the British occupation to have secret meetings. We saw a famous Egyptian composer there. Speaking of composers check out my friends website blaketyson.com. He and Liana are two of the most amazing musicians I know and the were in Egypt two years ago to perform with a famous Egyptian composer friend of theirs. So the night was wonderful and we talked until 12 am. All the men were so polite and intellectual and thoughtful. Eslam has dreams of living in Israel and loves Jewish people, I hope his dreams come true. Mustafa (sp?) is a teacher and has a brother who lives in Colorado and Sam speaks Italian and Arabic and is in medical school. I hope to keep in touch with them.   The next morning Mustafa and Sam met us to go to the Contemporary Art Museum in Alexandria. Our body guard who looked like Ben Affleck checked them out to make sure they were OK. They passed. The museum was amazing. They had two Bauhaus exhibitions and I totally could read all the German names. I am surrounded by Germany here, or at least German. And last summer I was surrounded by Egypt in Berlin with the Aglyptes Museum which is home to the famous bust of Nefertiti. Interesting transcultural ties.   The we saw the new Egyptian art I saw some amazing Alexandrian art. Seif Wanly was my favorite. Please google him! He painted a lion attacking a ring leader. You know how I love the world upside down paintings. And his abstract paintings about the universe and moon were some of the most asto0nishing uses of pink that I have ever seen! The were magic. He also painted Wagner's Valkeries. My favorite opera. This artist went all over the world. I also met a woman who is a painter named Mona who studies in Alexandria. I hope to keep in touch with her.   Then we parted ways and headed back to Cairo. Oh by the way the Landmark hotel that we stayed in Alexandria was so weird. We were like the only guests and we heard strange noises all the time like there were ghosts there or something. It seemed like only one man worked there and he was such a cartoon character. He was very nice. And we were the only ones at breakfast. What an experience. I love places with character. On the not so hot side my foot got eaten alive by I am guessing a spider and it looked like a turtle shell. It is just healing know and the bites have formed the shape of the Big Dipper or Ursa Major. Which is interesting because next week I start my astronomy summer class.  Ok so now I am in Sharm. Which is in the Sinai desert, which by the way is in Asia. Yep four continents in one month. Unglaublich! Our hotel looks like an Atlantian playground. We went swimming in the Red Sea today at Reef Beach. It is so beautiful here. And then we ate at the most amazing restaurant. I finally had an appetite. It was a Bedouin themed restaurant so it had a tent dessert feel, very nice but it served Italian food. The food was great. Now I am at a cafe trying to catch up with all of these adventures. it is just nonstop!   This is most likely my last post before I get back. So are going snorkeling in the Red Sea tomorrow and then we are driving to Mt. Sinai to watch the sunset and we will see the ever so creepy St. Catherine’s Monastery ( the one with all the monks skulls). Then back to Cairo and Amsterdam and Boise. Sharon and i are going to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.   Well I think I am caught up. Phew!
