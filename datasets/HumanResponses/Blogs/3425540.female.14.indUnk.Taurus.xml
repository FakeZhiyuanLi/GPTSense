      Hello everyone! Ok so Saturday I saw Shrek 2...it was a really good movie. Then Sarah spent the night and we burned CD's and stuff. Then on Sunday I had to go to my sister's graduation which was like sooo boring...and we were at the very top of the balcony and it was sooo fricken hot in the gym. IDK why, but for some reason I almost started crying when my sister walked across the stage to get her diploma. It's really wierd. I mean I hate my sister she's abusive! But I guess I am kinda gonna miss her...I mean it's gonna be so different. I've lived with her for 14 years and then she's gone. Well she doesnt leave til August but still I guess I am gonna miss her. N e wayz...then we went to the graduation party. I thought it was gonna be really boring but it wasn't. Kayla, Erika, Ashley, and Ronessa (my cousins) were there. So me Kayla and Erika played spoons...I love that game but it's not that fun with only 3 ppl. So anywayz...it was kinda nice to have mom and dad's family together at one time again...that hasn't happened for quite a while. And nobody fought or anything. Dad knows mom has a b/f. He asked me if he was nice to me and stuff. I mean he wasn't being snoopy he was just concerned I guess. Ok so then after the party Kayla spent the night. We burned some more CD's (I like making CD's ok!) and we watched South Park-Bigger Longer and uncut and Degrassi until like 3:30ish. Then we went to sleep and woke up around like 10:30. Then we ate breakfast and I fell asleap again for about 2 hours. And then we watched TV and stuff. We were watching Prom Date on MTV...it's like the bachelor only with prom dates and the girl's senior class picked her date for her. And like halfway through the show dad came in and started watching it with us. I found it pretty funny...he really gets into those girly shows. He's like "who do you think is gonna win? I think the muscle dude is gonna win". It was quite interesting. Then Kayla went home and I burned some more CD's and then came home which is where I am now! But next time I go to dad's I can't burn any more CD's...I don't have anymore songs that I want I have like everything! OMG like @ the graduation party we had rented a thinger of Bloomer's root beer so when the party was done we still had tonz left so we came home and put it in pichers and stuff...so now we have like 7 gallons of Bloomers root beer and a whole vedgie tray and a whole cheese tray and a crapload of cake. Graduations rock! TTFN!

And then guess what I noticed floating around in my lunch...BUGS!!! 6 or 7 or them!!! In my macaroni!!! Well I obviously didn't have mac and cheese for lunch. Cold pizza and chocolate pudding is so much better anywayz! Well TTUL!

        Hello readers! Well today was SOOOOOO exciting...psh...not! I'm cookin a pizza now...this is the 5th or 6th day in a row that I have had pizza. I'm so pathetic. I also think it's pretty pathetic that I'm listening to Britney Spears this is like to 30th time I've listened to this song today I love it. Wierd...n e wayz HAPPY BIRTHDAY TAYLOR ANN MCGINNIS!!! Ok well happy early birthday!!! OMG I'm going over to Sarah's at 6 and me her and Megan are gonna go watch the retarded musical the 6th graders are forced into doing! HAHAHA it's gonna be so great! Well I guess that's all for now! Luv ya much!

      I'm so happy! Ok so me and Megan were kinda in a fight because I overheard her say something mean about me when she was talking on the phone with Sarah (I was @ Sarah's at the time). So Sarah called me and we tried to settle the whole thing. So then Megan called me and we talked and apoligized and stuff and now we are all better which is good. But then me and Katie were still in a fight from on Friday, so Megan told me to call Katie. So I did and we apoligized and now its all good. And now I feel so much better. Ok I'm listening to the song Big Pimpin by Jay-Z...totally wierd. I never listen to rap. I was listening to New Found Glory earlier...they are acctualy a good band. I think I need to expand my variety in music more and not always listen to the depressing stuff. Oh and the song Roses by Outkast is like the best song ever I love it. Ugh I'm pretty bored. But I feel so much better now that everything is all settled and nobody is mad at each other. But it really sucks because I know that people are still going to talk about each other. I mean girls do that. And we keep secrets from each other and gossip and stuff. I mean I wish everyone would just quit and be nice. But there's always something floating around. I hate it. I mean I can't trust anyone. They promise they won't say anything and then they tell one person they think they can trust, but then that person just goes and tells more people. And then you've got this big thing floating around that was supposed to be a secret. It's so irritating. Don't ya think? Sometimes I wish I was a guy just for the simple fact that guys dont do this. I mean the whole gossipy bitch thing. Anywayz...omg I'm so excited the American's All musical is 2moro night! I'm totally going it's gonna be so much fun to watch all the little 6th graders act like idiots! We had to suffer through that now I'm gonna watch them! I can't wait it's gonna be such a blast. And all the 6th graders that I love to make fun of oh its gonna be great! Yeah I'm talking to Sarah about it right now. HI SARAH! If you see this n e wayz! Now we are talking about shoes and dresses for the recognition. We are having some major shoes isues. I dont know what kind of shoes are gonna match my dress which sux. I was thinking like black chunky flip-flops, but IDK because my dress is black and it goes up to my knees but then it slants down to my ankles and I dont know if it would look good. IDK what do you think guys? Oh but my dress isn't all black it has a pink strip on it. It's pretty cute I got it at JCPennies. I can't wait til the recognition ceremony it's gonna be so much fun. The dance and the pizza party and everything. But I'm gonna cry so much! I mean I have so many memories at the Middle School! I don't wanna go to the high school. And then everyone else is like omg I can't wait til high school there's gonna be so many hot guys! It's like omg...ok so there are hot guys big deal! I mean all the girls are bitches. I like being in 8th grade where you are the oldest and you know pretty much everyone. And I'm also sad becuase Evoanna is moving sometime...Voanna I love you! Don't leave! Anywayz...it's like Mrs. Engles said...the people you are friends now probably won't be your friends in 10 years. Which sucks cuz I love my friends! Well anywayz...I'm all home alone once again which is nice. Mom and Doug are at some thingy for my sister some award thing or something for another one of her great achievements. Psh...she bugs me...perfectionist. I wish mom would hurry up...she's bringing home Blizzards. Cookie Dough. Yummy. Well I have nothing else to say. Luv ya guys! Oh yeah also if you could PLEASE help me on my whole shoes delema that would be totally great! Bye!

Oh well I still have my other website http://kelseykolden.friendpages.com go there I have some great pictures. Pretty good blackmail on Sarah I posted some pics of that time we made her look like a goth it's great. My arm hurts. "It is impossible to lick your elbow...pause...75%of you are trying to lick your elbow" Ha ha I love that commercail it's on Z104. The first time I heard it I tried to lick my elbow...I felt pretty stupid. We were talking about that yesterday at my cousins house it was great all my cousins and were trying to lick their elbows it's pretty funny looking! Anywayz...now I'm gonna go eat supper. L8R.

      God I hate Sunday's they are so boring. Ya I had to watch Nick this mornin...that kid don't talk much. He just read Harry Potter and played gameboy and I put together a Little Mermaid Puzzle. Wow that was fun! Then I did my homework...which was even more fun! Then I ate pizza! For the third day in a row! Ya so n e wayz I'm probably gonna move into Brittany's old room because there is a cable hookup in there...that way I can have cable when I get my TV. But I only get like 25 channels. 2 of those channels are ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX...I don't understand why they have 2 of each channel...they usually play the same thing. I mean does channel 3 and 5 have to be NBC? I think one is enough. And there are like 3 QVC type channels. And the Golf channel? Who wants to watch golf? And then there's CSPAN and CSPAN2 with all those boring Public Affairs or whatever they call then...I dont think we need 2 channels of that crap. Channel 26 is ESPN2...but it's all fuzzy and black and white and stuff IDK why. I was watchin' a hockey game on that channel last night. Trust me it's more entertaining when you can here sound and see other colors other than black white and gray. If there was a Comedy Central I would be happy. But oh well...I'm getting a DVD player and probably a VCR too. Which is cool. And I get a bigger room. And I get to paint it! Unfortunatly I can't paint it blue like my room is now which sux cuz that color is pretty. Mom wants to sponge paint it. Probably some ugly color. I dont trust her she has bad taste. I think all moms do. I mean what possesed her to paint my room yellow when we first moved into this house? I mean really...yellow? Too bright for me. Expecially in the morning...ugh that was bad. And then she bought me a yellow bedspread and yellow pillows and stuff! I don't even like the color yellow! It's one of my least favorites! Let's see where yellow is at on my list...Pretty blue (the color of my room...it's acctualy called Powder Blue), Purple, Lime Green and other greenish colors (execpt forest green and shit green), Pink, Orange, Red, Yellow, Brown. Ok...so yellow is at the bottom of my list. And then she goes and truns my room into a big yellow blob. Well acctualy it was Buttercup Yellow...but who cares. It's still yellow and I still don't like it. God I'm so bored. Who's even gonna read this. I'm listening to Slipknot right now. Good band. Well I'm gonna go I guess cuz I'm bored and you're probably bored too. Luv ya!

      Ok so this one is pretty nasty. Not like nasty as in preverted nasty. But ok.  Ok so there were 4 guys standing outside a bar. So one guy walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a straw. He gives the man a straw and the man walks out. So the second guy walks in, also asking for a straw. He gives the man a straw and the man walks out. Then the third guy walks in and asks for the bartender for a straw. He gives the man a straw and the man walks out. Ok so now the bartender is really wondering why everyone wants a straw. Then the last man walks in. Unlike the others, he asks for a toothpick. The bartender says "Why do you want a toothpick? All the other guys wanted straws." The man answers him by saying "Some guy puked outside and now all that's left is the chunks they drank all the good stuff!"

        Hey ya'll what's up! Nuthin here...go figure! Total bored. I'v got the whole house to myself...Mom, Doug, Britt, and Nick are fishing. Yeah fishing at like 8:30 at night sounds like a lot of fun to me. Now fishing in the day in the nice sunny weather sounds better. But no worms. My foot's asleap. Go figure...I always sit on my left foot when I'm on the computer. Yeah I was looking through our new yearbook a bit ago...man it smells bad. Why do those things always reek? But the cover is sorta pretty. Better than last years. So far I have a total of...like...5 signatures! WOW! Oh yeah I'm so happy we are getting a satelite dish! Yay! And I don't think I spelled satelite right! Oh well! But we can't get one in my room so Mom's getting me a TV and a DVD player! But the dish is gonna be in the living room, Mom's room, and in the basement with the big screen TV. Man my foot is still asleap. I hate that. It feels like Mountain Dew...all fizzy and stuff. Ok so it doesn't have to be Mountain Dew...just some kind of carbonated beverage. But Mountain Dew is the best. And it's fun to have chugging contests with Mountain Dew. But never have a chugging contest with Diet Coke...makes ya puke. Unless you wanna puke. I don't know why anyone would wanna puke unless they are some anorexic freak. But why would you be anorexic I mean puke tastes so terrible. Not like I would really know I havn't barfed since 1st grade...I never get sick. Well I did like a week or so ago...but I didn't barf. Which was good. God my foot still feels carbonated. Mom always tells me to walk around on it when it falls asleap...I think it just makes it worse. Hmm I'm so bored. I hate spending the weekends all alone. Well Sarah spent the night last night...we rented Shallow Hal and some other movie. I fell asleap during the first five minutes of Shallow Hal. I hate that. Your like 'ok I'm not gonna fall asleap but I'm just gonna rest my eyes for 5 minutes...I can still hear every word...' and then your dead asleap. That happened in English class on Wednesday. But come on who didn't think that documentary was boring! And I fell asleap on Thursday in that class too. But we were just discussing that boring documentary. But it was only for like 2 minutes then Mr. F. came over and hit his clipboard against my desk. That's always embarrasing when that happens. Wow I'm bored. Holy shit. I think it's storming. The lights just flickered. Thank God the computer didn't go out. OMG I would be so scared. Cuz I'm downstairs so when it's dark...it's REALLY dark. And it's probably not too thrilling being in a really dark basement when you watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre a few days ago. Wow I kinda wrote a lot. Oh well. When I'm bored I write. I started writing in a journal in like 7th grade and I already have like 6 or 7 notebooks filled up. They are just sitting in my desk...untouched. I'm surprised Mom hasn't found them. I know when she snoops cuz nothing is in the right place. Well yeah I guess it is storming I can hear it thunder down here. I wonder if they are still fishing. Well yeah I guess I'm gonna go now...I'm sure all of you people arn't finding all this crap I've just writen too exciting. Tootles ya'll!

I rolled over this morning in bed and hit my head against the wall. Once at 7 in the morning and once at 11 in the morning. I havn't had a very good day! GRRR!

      Hey ya'll! This week has been so boring. Except Friday. Friday was fun we went to Six Flags for our field trip. And I finally got over my fear or rollercasters! Well I was never really scared of them...since I had never been on one before...I was just scared to go on them. But I had so much fun I went on Batman 3 times in a row. Ohmigosh we had like the worst bus lol. Kristina and Lynette got in this huge bitch fight. And Mrs. Hanley was on our bus...ugh I hate her! Everyone does! And then last night I spent the night @ Sarah's. And tomorrow is the last day of school! And the recognition ceremony! Yay! It's nice to have summer here I'm just kinda sad that we are leaving middle school! Ya IDK if I said this but I did find some good shoes to go with my dress! Yay! Well n e wayz I'm gonna go now. Goin to bed early. Even though I just woke up from a nap. Ok nap...that makes me sound like a 2 year old. Ok so I just woke up from crashing on my comfortable bed. That sounds a lil better. Whatever!
