      Well, more ear.  I just got it pierced.  In the cartilage with 16 gauge posts.  I think that most posts are 12 or 14 gauge (smaller).  I have really big rods through my ear.  oh well, I've just got one more left to do.  It has just been brought to my attention that.................  nevermind, I was going to say something, but couldn't think of anything to say.

      alrighty  I havent' posted in a really long time.  This means that the people who actually end up reading this will be treated to an exceptionally long blog.  I will tell you everything interesting that happened this past month.  I'm done.  no, I'm kidding......  This past mont, the thing that really sticks in my mind is warped tour.  It was awesome!!  I wen't with Zeke and my bro (that wasn't teh coolest thing in teh world, but hey).  While there, we done spotted Ethan, Kip, Sean, Carrie, Katy, and the one dude that were with them that I didn't know.  Yeah.  After teh first time we saw them, we were trying to find them again, so's we could tell Katy that Zeke had lost his glasses in a mosh pit.  woulda been great.  So, at warped tour, I was treated to my first mosh pit!!!!!  as well as my second, third, fourth fifth, sixth, and possible seventh (I can't remember).  aaaaaahhhhhhhhh..........  I'm also proud of myself, as I went over half the way around my block on the back two wheels of a wheelchair today (this is balancy, not someoneelsebeingadicky) yeah  uuuuuummmmmmmmmmmm........  happiness cuz i can be drive.....  yeah, that's all I can remember of my month so far  I'll come back later with more  if I can remember more...........................
