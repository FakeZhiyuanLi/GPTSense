						    Dear Reader... I made this site to express my true feelings to you people, and it helps that its FREE...(LOL) Many people think that im this pretty boy, jack ass, mother fucker, who can go fuck him self...Or they think as me as this so called PIMP or player... Well they only got 1 out of the 6 things right...(LOL)To tell you the truth im not any of those at all, I think of my self as a pretty boy, but I know im not, cuz im not perfect. No one is and I don't give a shit what people think of me becuz for all I care they are the pretty boys, jack ass', mother fuckers, who can go fuck them selves....  And I never understood why I got the nickname PIMP, and how people thought I was this big time hott shot player who was only looking for a night on the town... Becuz if you really saw through the cool guy player type, you will find this down to earth guy who likes hanging out with his friends and family... But no one gave me the time or day to get to know know who the real me is... All the girls I ever dated didn't want me for me they wanted me for my rep, except one girl... This girl was different from any-other one... She didn't make me feel as if I needed to be this stereo type that every one else thought I was... She made me become a better man now then I ever was... (And if you reading this, Thank You) (even though I said thanks aready, but just to let you know that im talking about you)Since of that relationship with her I look as girls for who they really are and if they really want me for me... I guess the real reason I made this site was to show you who the real person I am... And not this Skater Boy, cool guy person...  But more inporantly to get my Feelings and inner Emotions out... I guess on my xanga site I felt as if I wasn't able to truly tell you how I really felt... I know I could have just blocked or not told any-one that i had a site or somthing like that, but I wanted you people to really know how I feel and who I really am... And not this Hott shot player...                                       Till I write again...

						     "Every generation, balms the one before, and all there festerations come beating on your door, I know im a prisoner to all my father has so dear I know that I am a hostage to all his hopes and fears...I jus wish I could have told him in the living years... (Say it loud, say it clear, you can miss up as well as you hear, its to late, when we die, to omit that we don't see eye to eye) So we open a Carl between the present and the past, we only sacrifice the future its the bitterness that lasts...So you don't give to the furthers it might have a new perspective on a different day, and if you don't give up and you don't give in you may jus turn out ok...(So say it, say it loud, say it clear, you can miss up as well as you hear, its to late, when we die, to omit that we don't see eye to eye) I wasn't there that morning, when my father past away, I didn't get to Tel him all the things I had to say, I think I called his spirit later that same year, I know I herd his echo in my babies new born tiers...I jus wish I could have told him in the living years... (So say it, say it loud, say it clear, you can miss up as well as you can hear, its to late when we die, to omit that we don't see eye to eye) I jus wish I could have told him in the living years...(So say it loud, say it clear, you can miss up as well as you hear, its to late when we die, to omit that we don't see eye to eye)(So say it loud, say it clear, you can miss up as well as you hear, its to late when we die, to omit we don't see eye to eye)"
