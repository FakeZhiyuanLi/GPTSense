      That's right, I've started a blog.  What led me to do this? Fucked if I know. Basically it gives me a way to take my anger out on the world in a civilised, punctual fucking manner.  I don't know what is to come next.

      It's true, mobile phones are great devices.  I've had one since i was 13, plan of course, not shitty pre paid which Evan always complains about, and, I've always had a regular wage earning job to pay for my phone bill.  But why are phones so great? Because they are becoming more stable, smaller/bigger, better battery life and more reliable.  I change phones every now and again, having had the ever popular Nokia 3310 for 2.5 years, followed by a Sony Ericsson T610 for 8 months, an N-Gage (POS) for a month, a Nokia 7650 for a month (old, but top phone), and currently, have a brand spanking new Sony Ericsson K700 in my possession which I've had for the last week, not even out here yet. Take a look at my precious:  http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_k700-692.php  New, small, super tankish battery life, and a whole load of features. And yes, I can control my mobile phone bill, but a phone is essential for me as I need to be picked up from all the places I go, unless otherwise catching public transport.  But, Evan is against the 90% or whatever it is of Australians that own and use a mobile phone.

      No, this isn't a post about some 'B' grade cock sucking yank movie.  So why haven't I posted much so far?  The Reason: Who the fuck knows about my blog apart from Evan?  Seriously, I have not told any of my school mates about this, or even what a blogger is, under the fear of being looked at as a weird uber person.  Apart from that, life is good :D

      It has, indeed, been a while since my last post on this site.  This is because I have been very busy, be it school, post office, baker's delight, goal umpiring, homework or gym, give or take a few hours sleep here and there.  Not much has changed, added gym to the routine, going well so far. Funds saving is at an all time low, but with the extra worked hours at the post office are quickly sky rocketing into buying stuff land.
