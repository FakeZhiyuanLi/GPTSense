      Is it really July 22?  I can't believe this...I've been going through my things, trying to purge my closets, my material possessions, realizing that where ever I end up, I'm moving from this apartment in December.  There are so many things I should do, need to do, want to do.
I started collecting up some old purses, thinking I can sell them on e-bay & make some spare cash... "spare" -- yeah right!  Some cash, I should say.  :)  I came across my lace-up brown boots from Victoria Secret.  I loved these boots -- even wished while in England that I had them with me 'cause it was so cold, and I had worn them so much this year.  I looked in my front closet, slid my foot in & glided the strings along the 16 eye-hook catches, then realized how longs it's been since I've been here, in Akron, in my apartment, with these boots :), and I thought, I'm not even sure I still like these boots...don't know if they're in style, if they're my style.  
What a time of transition.  I'm weighing all these options, all these thoughts...and, actually, I'm lonely.  I miss Jeff -- want to talk to him, but the time difference and our different activities haven't allowed us time to talk.  He's given me liberty -- said if I the desire, this urge to go abroad to teach, I have his blessing (not his words, of course).  He's so wonderful to me, wants the best for me, is looking out for me, and loves me.  And, I love him and want the best for him...want him to succeed in his music and career.   Strange to think of us apart, not a couple, not because of the "idea" of being a couple so much as that I've been growing up with him, yapping about life, growing and changing in wonderful ways with him in my life for 5 yrs now...
I think I've been depressed these last few days, weighing things, gaining weight :), trying to work out, trying to be healthy.  Feeling a bit better today, in a better mood.  :)  Realizing that I must do things, 'cause I'll be away in Kentucky, then New York, then, the summer's almost over and I don't want it to be...sad that school will be starting, sad to take the course load I have...glad to finish school in December...not resenting school, not begrudging it, just feeling like I've changed & not wanting to enter into my old habits, my old life.  I keep saying I'm different, after London, and it's not that I'm different so much as that things I've always wanted have re-awaken as possibilities.  Things I'd given up on, in a sense.  I've been tempered, in good ways, by "growing Up", by realizing that life needn't be an unnecessary fight against reality...but some things should be stood up for still.  Things I want to do: become more politically aware, become more civically active, learn geographical locations of countries.  Learn to speak Spanish and French.  Read more, for leisure.  Read best sellers.  Learn to "talk politics" 'cause I'm aware & care about it.  Be kind to strangers.  Have a strong-will, but an open-mind. Get into a healthy life-style that includes good, healthy eating habits and a consistent exercise routine.  Laugh, a lot, and be merry, and take life and it's little twists in stride and with a smile.  Write a book -- a good book -- a reflection of me -- and don't worry too much if it or other things I produce are not unblemished or perfect.  Live a good life that I'm proud of in which I treat others well and judiciously and say what I mean and feel, not what's easiest, and that when people say something that hurts my feelings, I step back, assess how I feel, and tell them, instead of saying something hurtful or reactionary to save my pride or hide my insecurities.  To be truthful and just and real -- a genuine life unmarred by hate or greed or jealousy.  This is the life I want.  Is it asking too much?  :)  No, I don't think so...  :)  I am happy with my life, I just want to make some positive changes so that I'm challenged to grow and be more and live more and do more and be part of this world...  :)

      Writing the date makes me conscience of the passage of time.  I start to reflect  and question, thinking things like: Is it really [insert date]?  Wow, it seem like just yesterday...!    Man, this [summer/winter/autumn/spring/month/day/week] has really flown!        Then I think about how old I am & how I feel more like the age I look than the age I really am {most recent comment was that I look 17!}.  :)   I realize now that I have stories.  I mean, I always, or have long appreciated that people, all people, have stories, have interesting lives & histories to be honored & told -- exactly why I try to appreciated people, even if they strike me as a bit annoying or pedantic at first glance.  But, I'd begun to give up on being a writer or began to think I could only write by first studying about it & learning different impressions & strategies for deteriming & creating good writing.  But, like the running website I looked at that said the best advice for new runners is to just get out there & run -- just do it {yikes! unintentional advertising slogan implemented -- am I so inundated by the media that I can't marinate an orignal thought? :) }  So, to be a runner, one needs to run -- and I'm thinking, now, the same goes for writing -- I just need to do it, let it flow.
