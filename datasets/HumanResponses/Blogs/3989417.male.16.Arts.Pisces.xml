        Dear Log,    &nbsp;  Work yesterday beat the shit out of me like the day before, except the beating wasn't as bad as two days ago. Since the emphasis on the stove was purely not to use it at all, I was happy. When I got home I took a large ass nap and waited for dinner to come. It was tuna salad. Love that stuff nuff said.     &nbsp;   Since I took a long nap I decided to stay up late. I stay up until four with my best friend, Xander. Today I want to go over to his house but it would end up being later at night than I planned. I forgot I had and eye appointment. I also joined   urlLink  Deviant Art   , but I only have one photograh and most of you have probably already seen it. I plan to put another on today. Drawings like I said would end up being a slow and painful process. I wish I could put drawings on often because I totally would.      &nbsp;  How does that sound for a day? ^_^

        My heart seemed to ache of my missing love,holding him would indeed be nice. His fingers carressing mine and sitting there knowing that everything, everything in the sphere of Malkuth was good. Thy mind would be content and thy soul would be complete.

         I am really starting to enjoy indie rock so much, I am listening to Indie Mix on AOL radio. My sister introduced it to me and I love it. Two favorite rock styles are Alternative and Indie^_^. I am not really preoccupied with anything at the moment. It's seven thirty in the morning. I am ready to work. I have kitchen duty this week and it is anything but easy. Yesterday we worked with really hot items of food, such as boiling and frying. The kitchen got to about 110 degrees fahrinheit. Six hours standing and then a staff meeting. Boy was I tired. Today so far I read a e-mail from Kirsten, which made me happy to hear from her, however Asia left for Portland, Oregon. Breakfast consisted of Pai Thai and cookies that I made from work yesterday and left over pizza that I ate for dinner. I also got an account at photobucket. com, so I can upload my pictures online. Tomorrow there is no work at all, which I adore, I wish to hang out with Xander then but I forgot to ask him and what are the chances of me getting online late at night. Suppose I better be off, I have to wake my sister up for work.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Paix, amour, unité et respect

        I think that there is a big difference between spirituality and being religious. To be religious would mean to have a religion. Not to just have a religion but to support it with much love, read the scriptures of the religion and to take hold of all or most of its beliefs. I see it to take religion to be something concerning faith in the claims to salvation of one faith tradition or another, an aspect of which acceptance of a metaphysical or supernatural reality, including perhaps and idea like heaven or nirvana. Spirituality I take to be concerned with those qualities of the human spirit- such as love and compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, a sense of responsibility, a sense of harmony- which brings happiness to both self and to others. With this said, religion often includes most of the things in spirituality, but most of the time it is almost always about following your faith blindly. Religion is not needed to develop spirituality. I am very spiritual but I am an atheist, you can even ask my friends too. I say that religion has more to do with metaphysics, while spirituality has more so to do with ethics. This is why I think that the world can do with out religion because when we look at religion a lot of the times we see some of its people harnessing spirituality but most only follow blindly to their god. With this a bay, they cannot have tolerance because they see their religion as the only true one and all others are false. You cannot have compassion for someone when you cannot tolerate them, it is simply too hard.Those who practice religion would; of course, right to say that such qualities, or virtues, are fruits of genuine religious endeavor and that religion therefore has everything to do with developing them and with that may be called religious practice. But let us be clear on this point. Religious faith demands spiritual practice. Yet it seems there is much confusion, as often among religious beliefs or among non-believers, concerning what this actually consists in. The unifying characteristic of the qualities I have described as spiritual may be said to be some level of concern in others’ well being. Moreover, the one who is compassionate, loving, patient, forgiving, and so on to some extent recognizes the potential impact of their actions on others and order their conduct accordingly. Thus part of spiritual practice involves acting out of others well being. Another part of it involves transforming ourselves so that we become more readily disposed to do so. To speak of spiritual practice in any terms other than these is meaningless.

         I am the dark lord who rules our dreams from a place of shadows and fantastic things. I am a modern Morpheus, the lord of story. Older than humankind itself, I inhabit -- along with Destiny, Death, Destruction, Desire, Despair, and Delirium, my Endless sisters and brothers -- the realm of human consciousness. My powers are myth and nightmare -- inspirations, pleasures, and punishments manifested beneath the blanketing mist of sleep.For I am Lord Azriel King of all night's dreaming.
