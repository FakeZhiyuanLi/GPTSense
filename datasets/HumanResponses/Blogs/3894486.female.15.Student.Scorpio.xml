         I babysat from 1 till 4.40 and well that was a bore...when I got home I got online for a little bit then me, danielle, and my mom headed over to Children's lighthouse. It was alot of fun. we went swimming with the kids and for dinner my mom made really good tacos. All of the kids loved her tacos. We also jumped on the trampoline and played volleyball. Danielle spent the rest of the night looking at zulphia's pictures with her and zulphia gave me and danielle each a braided friendship bracelet that she had made. It was so sweet.&nbsp; When we got home we went to alex's house because he's leaving on saturday morning and I won't see him today because I'll be with maria and I don't want to ruin everything I have planned for her. He told me he was gonna miss me and that he'd call me on saturday. *sigh* I miss him already...

       well today I woke up way late..it was like 12.15ish...wow that is super late. Alex was supposed to come over but of course he didn't. he said it was because he had to pick his uncle up from dayton which makes sense, I just wish he would have called. I mean come on...he pinky swore!lol so I had my second oboe lesson today and well that was fun. I then went shoe shopping for my cousins wedding this weekend. of course I have to pass out programs for it meaning I actually have to look nice cuz I'm officaly"apart of the wedding"...they even put a bio about me in the program...urgh... but yeah..my mom wants me to wear a dress and well I said no..I want to wear a skirt but she said I won't be dressed up enough but I don't really care cuz I 'm gonna wear what I wanna wear...*sigh*   then I stopped home for a little bit and changed my clothes and then me and mommy headed to Childrens lighthouse which is a house for kids (ages 10-21 are there right now) can stay while getting free surgery and medical care in the us..I got to meet all of them and they are just so cool..they're so sweet, caring and I duuno just all have really big hearts. right now all of them are from tugikistan(spelling?) the couple who owns the house is going to honduras next week to get more kids. then they're take another missions trip in october to tungikistan and want me to come :) and I might actually be able to which means I wouldn't see alex when he comes to visit and I wouldnt be here for my 16th birthday but to me none of that matters. I'd much rather be there doing the works of the Lord..most of the kids are muslim but have become christians since being here which is way awesome...one girl even got healed! God's love is so amazing...well after that I came home and went rollerblading with my alex..haha...but yeah I'm gonna head to bed...

I wish he could move here but I know he can't stay here...he just sees the person inside behind the smile and well I love that about him...kinda like ashlee simpsons new song(I hate her but I like this song)   "Fall with you I fall so fast   I can finally catch my breath   I hope it lasts   Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real   and I like the way that feels   Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself   and I love how you can tell all the pieces of me"    &nbsp;  *sigh*I'm gonna miss my alex...I'll post a pic of us once I take one tomorrow...thats if he comes over...urgh he better!   well I think I'm gonna go shower and head to bed so I can wake up and make myself look pretty in the morning...  &nbsp;

      Well yesterday I spent most of the day just sitting around till 3:30 when my mommy picked me up and drove me out to BG for my first private oboe lesson with Mrs. Hancock...The lesson went well and she really helped me alot with pitch and balance. After the lesson we headed to the mall to go jeans shopping. We went into Abercrombie*shivers* for like my first time ever and I tried on a ton of jeans...I found out I was a size 6 which is better than a size 11 which is what I was during the school year. That made me really happy. None of the jeans looked that great on me so we went to american eagle. I tried on some sale jeans but those fit funny too. My mom was not about to buy me full priced jeans so I got a sweet shirt instead!  but yeah...later on I had cell group and then I went to baskin robins and went running in the rain...fun...

      well today I cleaned all day cuz we're getting ready to sell the house...we're supposed to put it up for sale in about a weekish and well I am super excited to say the least about moving... perrysburg has treated me nothing but crappy...I hate this town it's so URGH!! freshmean year was the worst year of my life but also the best in many ways...I had alot of bad things happen but I met some great people along the way. God brought me to mychal for 6 months and that was just great. He highered my self-esteem so much and treated me so well... Then there's maria...this summer we have gotten so close and she is soo awesome and we are like joined at the hip and like I could never get sick of her...I love her she's my best friend! Matt...he's been so cool and like I duuno it's awesome to have someone who actually calls me to do stuff rather than me calling him...he's a very sweet and caring guy and one of my best friends..he's also a great listener and good at giving advice...and I like tacos more than him lol...but I love that kid! I duuno right now I just feel so lost in myself..like I'm not sure who to be or who   ...I'm really nervous about the new school ~I just want people to like me and accept~it'd be way cool to be popular and bring everyone to church..thats my goal! lol but I duuno I'm just worried that I'll be a loser again like I am at p-burg ~I'm so sick of being teased and bullied...I just don't know whats wrong with me like why people like to make fun of me,,,am I too fat?ugly?loud?annoying? I duuno whats wrong with me..I just wish I knew what it was..  ya know what I hate~I hate it when you like someone so much but you're good friends with that person so you're afraid to tell them cuz you don't want it to ruin the friendship..I wanna tell him so bad but I'm so scared of what he'll say and I'm scared of rejection...I just wanna be his girl but I duuno he's just so much fun to hang out with and seems like he'd be such an awesome boyfriend but I guess we'll just be friends which is cool but it's hard to have a crush on you're friend and not want to be more...everytime I look into his eyes I just wanna tell him but I can't and I duuno when I'm with him it just feels so right...*sigh*  well my parents are out tonight and I'm home alone...*yawns*well I'm sleepy so I'm gonna go now...

       Well yesterday was my first day of band camp. I walked in and sat down in my seat but no one talked to me at all. Everyone looked at me like I was some kind of alien. Come to find out they all thought I was a frosh lol well once the band director announced that I was a new student I got bombarded with people introducing themselves. It was hysterical. Well I met this chick Becky. She's prty cool and I went to her house after BC(band camp). We walked to the mall and talked alot.    Today was my 2nd day of BC and it was beckys b-day(happy birfday hun!). Well I was supposed to go to her house after BC but my sis was supposed to be in town but then come to find out after I got home my sis isn't coming till tomorrow and my ma wouldnt drive me back out to beckys house. so maria came over and we chilled then went to the mexican-american festival. We chilled w/simeon a little . Then this kid was smoking and I almost had an asthma attack! I like could of died. Thats sick. I hate when people smoke! Speically someone who's only 17! urgh! sick! ( stand  up speak out against tobacco! haha I'm a member of  stand ! I wish I would have had  stand  gear on at the time! lol that would have been funny!) but yeah then we left and came back here. Danielle came over and the three of us watched my new dvd 'You got served' . I am so obsessed with that movie! Maria's sleeping over tonite so thats good. she's upstairs rite now doing who knows what. but yeah...guess what everyone! I'm starting hip-hop dance(pop n' lock,breakdancing, and general street dancing) on the 23rd! I can't wait! I love being on dance crew at church but I'm not so great so I decided I wanted to take classes because I just LOVE to dance. This is the one type of dance I think I could actually learn how to do well. lol but yeah so thats exciting.    Lately I've been having alot of trouble being outgoing. because like I don't even fit in at church and thats sad. I just feel so left out of everything. I have two best friends(you know who you are) and thats all. I did have more but they all are leaving me for other people. I don't even know what I did. there was one person who well lets just say we were beyond tight (lol ghetto me! haha yeah right!) but then some things happened and well now we're talking again which is sweet. I really hope we get close again. Then there's another person who I really really thought cared about me and I duuno we were like pretty close ya know hung out alot and just had fun. Well I have no idea why but this person like doesn't ever seem to wanna hang out anymore and that hurts alot. I call this person like all the time but they're always with someone. They say they're just busy and we'll hang out soon but if this person really wanted to hang out with me they could actually ya know now hang with the other friends for once...mabye I'm being to sensitive but seriously I just feel like I have some disease thats keeping people from me. With all the people leaving me I'm starting to be not outgoing anymore because like I'm so afraid of not fitting ing and just being rejected. I'm so scared about my new school! *shivers* Only God can save me now! but no matter what if everyone leaves me I still have my best friend Jesus Christ to be there for me. because no matter what he'll never leave me! I love JC!
