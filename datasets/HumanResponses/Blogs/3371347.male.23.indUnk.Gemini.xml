      My dear brother, my dear family When I read Carlos's message,I tried not to cry in the office. I miss u so much too. I know that I have a real friend, a brother, a family in GUATEMALA. I m sure. It is very interesting that we spend 24 hours ,10 weeks together as all DBMS family but now we don't know if we can see each other again. Please, I want something from all of you. Tell the best moment for you with DBMS family and Let us to remember that moment again. I miss you all.  Firstly I want to tell. The best moment was the last night of the study tour.  I think you all remember the party in the Garden in Mysore. After that party , while we were returning to the hotel  in the bus I enjoyed so much. I think everybody enjoyed alot. Everybody were dancing and singing. also it was still happening when we entered the hotel. We showed that "WE ARE THE BEST" ,isn't it... Ozgur from Turkiye
