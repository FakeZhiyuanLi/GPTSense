         A big week-end this week, so many things to do, and no time to write all I want. So I'll write later why I would like to speak a better English, how I was so afraid this afternoon by an Arabian horse who turn all around me one hour, why I hate all this stupid people who throw paper by their car's screen and my favorite question "why I'm so sad  with beautiful things close to me ?"  Have sweet dreams from Toulouse to London to Tofu to Mars, take care... Hope I can be back very soon  If there is something at the bottom of the whole...It's me, waiting me I go up !  Ahh je ne peux m'empécher de laisser un petit mot en français. Ecrire en anglais m'oblige a progresser, mais je suis en même temps frustré de ne pas pouvoir exprimer correctement mes sentiments. Tant de mal-être en moi sommeille, tant de non-sens, tant d'idée noire sur un avenir que j'imagine déjà vécu. Un rien m'agace, je ne trouve pas la force de remonter la pente, je "négative" sans cesse et la moindre mésentante devient prétexte à une scène de ménage...  I will translate later :o

         I am sad to be like this, it was too stupid to act like I do actually. I'm so indifferent to my life. Not agressive like she said, but indifferent, like someone who wait a disaster to born again like a phenix (What's the name of the dumbledore's phenix ? Fumseck no?). So I had a verry good job, a nice house, a nice car, a big motorcycle, a 130 cm TV, a lot of computer, a nice wife. My life is so boring than I dream to break it all to rebuild something different. Stupid little boy I am, He want to break all his toys... I'm waiting this little spark who can help me.... Wait again wolkam...Wait  WAKE UP !!!!!! DAMNED !!!!!!  "Le dormeur doit se réveiller (Dune)"

         It's the film I had watch yesterday on TV "You've Got Mail". With two very good actors (tom hawks & Meg Ryan Mmmmm)I had watch this film one more time... It was verry funny, pleasant, romantic... The feeling show on this film was so near of the feeling we could have here... It's strange how in so few time we can be so close friend, there is no limit, we can say all the things we haven't never said to someone in the real life. And it's not so superficial than the non introduce people thinks.  It was so strange, so special, I like this !!!!!! For my dear wife, this film show how people are stupid. She is angry about all this place where I go sometimes. In this part of me where she can't reach me, here... My so british secret garden was my second life!  In my secret dream, I'm an artist, living in London (speaking a perfect english lol)with a nice and intelligent girl and two funny children. Yep !!! I'll do this in my next life Sure !!!  Don't be afraid, I'm today verry happy in th south of France, with a verry nice and sportive girl and I speak a perfect french ! Isn't it ????

         Your romanticized image of the lovely french are verry funny dear asphaire, it's like all the so romantic barbecue french sauce I had taste in florida. So funny... In fact a lot of my friend are as romantic as a 200 kg Pink Pig. In each legend, there is a part of true, so perhabs we are romantic. One things I'm sure, it's that I'm really a romantic guy, but it was so hard sometimes... Pooor boy Bouhouhouuu. Sometimes I think it was more easy If like my dear father I had a lot of other women in my life. But it's physically impossible (at this time) I can't do something like this. So many guy make love with other woman than their wife... I don't know how they do that (Juju you don't understant me on this point)... I'had tried last year, it's impossible for me, I can't do this, perhabs it's because I 'm not able to hurt someone, in particulary my wife... But one things is sure, for me it's more dangerous and difficult (and hard to live) to fall in love to an other woman. And if I can control my sexual pulsion, I haven't found how to control my heart.  Perhabs I'm not a so Open-Mind guy ???  Look at this, it's a perfect picture of the real wolkam ;)

         So strange since few time... Who can understand, she's so pretty, since 17 year soon. 17 year to dream about the perfect life... And one day, 4 years ago, the end of the dream begin. Waiting a baby... Waiting again... Obsession of my wife... To make love only to have a baby...Why we havn't try soon... Doctor, after doctor, Hospital, In-Vitro process, and finally, the reason is... A rare disease inside my wife .... Very funny no ???? You ask Why ??? Simply cause I'm président of an association who help people who have rare disease, like my mother, and now, My wife as a rare disease ! If I trust in God, I will explain him one or two things.Stupid guy... So no baby, Ok... Try adoption ? 4 years of problem and you wand I insist ??? Why you don't try to adopt? Only because our life is not so perfect now... My wife have had a period where making love have no sense. Why making love if we couldn't make baby ??? And me ? Afraid by the disease, I forgot I had a wife, and I looking for a new life. A virtual life with only good things... we have had a verry hard moment. Separation, appartment, and finally after so many discussions, I come back. So ok, no baby, the disease sleep, well... Trying to made a lot of things, it's so good. Our life is not perfect, but we are happy, the only thing, is ... Nothing will change in the futur, tomorow will be like today, no surprise, no adventure, no children to learn him the name of the the star in the night. Nothing at all, just trying to think it will be more hard. But sometimes, I dream about another live, with another woman who don't know me so well, I would like surprise in my life, I would like the sun, the beach, a lot of smile, and two children runing around me...  Ok life is life, I'm not perfect, And I'm the only personn who can judge me. Like hippo has wrote "Buy you a mirror befor judge me".

         Where is the limit between the real world and my virtual life?  Does I need to search this limit?  It was so strange to found so many friendly peoples in this new virtual universe.  I have found so many pleasure on line, so many experiences with fantastic people. And what ??? This is not so magic, people are like me, I couldn't lie to myself.  I learn this, mistakes after mistakes, they are no so beautiful feelings here. This world is not so different, in fact, people doesn't lie to me, it's just me who want to see them so magic. When I meet you online on MSN my dear Juju, I really think you was an exceptionnal woman. You said no, but I doesn't hear you. After I met you in the real world in London, we've spend a great week and now I know you aren't an exceptionnal woman, you are just a woman (a pretty woman lol) with your own problems. And me I'm a just a man...  I know who is the real Juju and I can say only one thing... Juju, I love you like you are, You are my best friend, little sister. Big kiss to you, take care, and sweet dreams to you  Just a little song to you...      I'm sorry if I made you cry, if I said a lie,     I'm a just a man, please give me your hand     I have more to give, you have to believe     I'm a just a man, please give me your hand

         Elle est enfin apparue, je ne l'imaginais pas du tout comme cela, je la voyais plutot ronde, un air sérieux, un peu comme astrid. En fait elle est trés différente, belle, expressive, amusante, en un mot, trés jolie. C'est étrange d'attendre quelque chose de qqun que l'on ne connais meme pas. Comme si il y avait un vide à combler, comme si tout ce que j'avais vécu il y a quelque temps n'avait pas suffit... Besoin de rève peut-être, d'aventure méta-physique... Le tout au travers du virtuel pour être sur de ne pas se bruler les ailes, et pourtant, je sens encore les traces de la précédente brulure. J'ai été sage, je n'ai pas franchis la ligne jaune, je me suis contenté d'une accolade tendre et rassurante, une sorte de démonstration d'affection. Mais il n'en aurai surement pas été ainsi si je l'avais rencontré au moment le plus fort de cet étrange relation. A cet instant là, j'avais vraiment pris la décision de franchir le pas. Carpe Diem, saisit l'instant et le bonheur qui en découle. Mais j'aurai pu, tout m'y poussait, même ceux qui s'en le savoir me poussait vers cette ligne que je ne récait que de franchir. Comment ai-je pu accumuler autant de sentiments, aussi bon que mauvais en si peu de temps ??? Moi qui voulait de l'avaneture, j'ai eu ma dose, jusqu'à ce T1 minuscule et ces quelques mois de célibat qui m'on ouvert les yeux.  Le dormeur doit se réveiller. Et il est réveillé, la bouche pateuse, il décide enfin de se lever et d'avancer à nouveau. Finit cette monotone létargie dans laquelle il se complaisait, accompagnée par celle qui comme si elle lui devait la vie n'osait pas le réveiller, le laissant et l'encourageant à se laisser vivre. Elle adorait un dieu. Un dieu que je ne suis plus. Je ne suis plus adorable, je suis decendu de mon piedestal, d'une marche de trop je pense, je ne suis plus le même à ces yeux, je ne dit pas que c'était mieux avant, mais pour quelqu'un qui marche à la reconnaissance, se retrouver si bas à ces yeux, c'est que chose d'un peu dur parfois. J'ai rallumé le PC, je me suis mis au trial, je finis Harry Potter 5, autant d'échapatoires... En est-ce vraiment ? ou est-ce simplement comme cela que l'on doit vivre ? Ma vision du monde à bien changé à présent. Partager l'amour d'une vie n'est je pense pas une finalité, ni quelque chose de suffisant pour occuper nos entières journées. Alors je profite des plaisir simple, en écoutant du Per Gessle, je cultive mon petit jardin secret, cela ressemble plus à une jardinière qu'à un potager, mais cela me suffit aujourd'hui. La vie n'est pas rose, ni rouge Melle l'anglaise si belle et désirable. Ici au pays du soleil, je ne vois qu'alternance de ton nuancé, comme Tépacap ne fait pas vraiment peur, la vie n'est pas pure jouissance. Il y a des nuances partout, même dans les orgasmes. Jean-Jacques disait que c'était entre gris clais et gris foncé, pour moi en ce moment, c'est plutot entre bleu ciel et bleu goncé. J'aime la vie et je l'aime aussi, comme j'aimerai aussi une autre vie d'aventure...

         To be an artist, someone who can put all is emotion in colour, someone who can take ground in his hands, and by the side, express all his feeling. I would like to speak english as well I speak french, I would like to be a good boy... But why ? Since few year, I explore my brain to try to understand how it works. Perhabs it's since I was 30 year old. I know who I am, I know why I'm not perfect, and I know that my principal engine is the recognition of people for me. So I do many thing to help us, and sometimes it was very good things. Et si je ne suis pas aussi bon que j'aurai souhaité l'être, je sais au moins que je suis conscient de cet état de fait, que cela ne peux que m'aider à progresser, et si je continu aussi à céder à certaine de mes pulsions, si cela n'est pas en accord avec la prude moralité de certain puritain bien pensant, cela ne me gène pas, je suis en accord avec moi même. Si je viens en aide aux autres pour avoir leur reconnaissance, si ce n'est pas fait avec la grnadeur d'âme qui aurait fait de moi un saint, le principal, c'est bien d'avoir aidé quelqu'un non ? Alors oui, j'aime savoir qu'on me considère, j'aime la reconnaissance, je m'en sert pour avancer, et c'est ma façon d'être.  En attendant, je reste admiratif envers le travail de DAY Paul, et qui c'est peut-être que lui aussi à besoin de cette reconnaissance ??? Après tout, nous ne sommes que des hommes...

         Je me disais que quoi qu'en disent certains (ou certaines) nous héritons malgrès nous d'un mode de vie qui fût même à la base un instinct de survie... Tu te demandes de quoi je suis en train de parler ? Prends un exemple, "Man and sex". Pour quoi dans la grande majorité des cas on pense que les hommes sont plus attiré par le sexe que les femmes. Tous simplement parqu'à mon avis, c'est le pur reflet de la réalité. La vrai question, c'est plutôt pourquoi on trouve cela anormal chez les hommes, alors que cela semble tout à fait compréhensible chez les animaux. Non sérieux, je met pas tous sur le compte de l'instinct de reproduction, mais je suis sur que cela y joue pour beaucoup. Il nous faudrat encore quelques milliers d'années avant que nos instinct ancestraux s'nfouissent au plus profond de nous. Pour ma part, je ne renie pas l'héritage de Gaïa, l'esprit de la terre, la seule que l'on puisse hisser au rang de divinitée. Mère nature, je t'adore, toi et tous ce que mes congénère et moi-même sommes en train de détruire au jour le jour, cette magnifique planète. Je n'éspère qu'une chose, c'est que la race humaine disparaisse du globe avant de le détruire complètement...

         I'm playing online last night with American player, and I know how it's difficult for me to understand people who write in a bad English (in Philippians too). It's like if I said in my bad French "j'capte rien a ce qui m'disent". Something like this was better "Je ne comprend rien à ce qu'ils me disent".  The difference between what I really want to tell you and what you really understand was very important particularly if the language was different. For example, I write my thought on this blog, but in reality, I don't write exactly what I think, because word miss to me. I think I can write in English about 70 % of my real thought (so 30% missing), but (there is always a but) I translate some expressions who doesn't exist in English language (10 %) and sometimes (very often in fact) I don't use the good word (15 %), or my grammar isn't exact (30%).  Ok, let me take my calculator:  ((((100 thought - 30%)- 15%)-10%)-30%)= 37.485 %  of thought you have really understand. Ok, I will try now a feat. This is an understanding test I do now (try to understand): "I like the new design of my blog" If you really understand that "J'aime le nouveau design de mon blog" So You understand 100% of my thought. Yessss Hope it works :D

         I had a very nice week-end with a lot of surprise. It was one of my lovely birthday. My wife give me two fabulous gifts. The first was a nice watch "Yema" a very very beautiful gift. The second was more beautiful ! It was..... Suspense... A 4 hours Trial (motorbike) training period with a French champion. I had a French champion only for me :p Mouarffffff. So Friday afternoon we went to the trial school near Carcassonne (a French town) with my trial motorbike and I spend my 4 hour to Learn how to become a champion ;) I had eat a lot of speck of dust, climbing on very high rock, falling sometimes too :). Finally, I came back exhausted to home with a lot of good advice, and so many things to remember for my future competition. Thank you my darling for this marvelous gift.

         I ride my (wife's) motorbike every day now. I feel so free on my motorbike ! It's a great pleasure ! For those who haven't ride a motorbike, let me give you the number one rule to ride it; motorbike will go where you look at. You doesn't need to turn the handlebars. If you look at right, you will go on your right (Caution! it works with the left too).  I can say it was like in the life, we need to look at in front of us to progress. When you had a problem on your motorcycle, for example two big trucks take all the road (yes it was a problem, be sure of this), there is two solutions for us, the first one is to watch the trucks and to say "Ohhh my god, I had a BIG problem". 5 seconds after you really have a problem, cause you go where you look at, and you look at the truck. The other solution (the good one) is to look at the little space between the two trucks, after this you will be able to thanks god. I know that someone think to the third solution who is to look at the sky and to pray. Trust me, only E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial can fly with a bike by looking at the sky, and I'm not sure it works with a motorbike who is more heavy. Another thing who doesn't work when you ride a motorbike is to look at behind you. Does I need to explain that when you look at behind you, you can't see where you go or who you could meet (trucks or love)? You must keep in mind this, the past is the past, you can only choose witch road you will take on the next cross-roads. So we have look at in front, in back, up, we can now watch on the side. Because you are not alone on this world, there is always someone at your side. When we are on the border of the road, with a mechanical problem, there is always someone who ride on your left (English people who ride in the bad way must translate themselves) and who can help you if you ask them. If you haven't problem, think to watch on your right (English bla bla bla...) if someone need your help, if there is someone who is stop on the emergency way, think to help us, motorcyclist always do that. Have a nice trip my friends and look at the road ;)

         Beginning of summer was a great time for me, It's the BBQ season ! I could do BBQ every day if my wife doesn't stop me, and she is right to do this. First you can't do a BBQ alone, you must be at least two, and if you have many friends, it's better ( for BBQ ). You must have all the good ingredient (meat, salad & vegetable, wine, sauce). And you must really want to do a BBQ (really important). When I know that I'll made a BBQ on evening, I think to this all the day. I prepare the sauce for the meal the morning, I put the wine on fridge, and I cook tsatziki sauce 3 hours before BBQ. When time has come, WE made BBQ, I light on the fire and she cook the salad (man on fire, woman on salad, a real cliché) And when all is alright, we put the table on the garden, and we eat this marvelous meal while mosquitoes suck our blood  Grr . For those who know I'm French you can now said French BBQ was the most romantic. :D The greater pleasure for us, is that we had wait this moment for long time. Some stupid guy who lived in great town in France do BBQ all the day on an electric system with a cheap meat & cheap beer. Let them this stupid guy alone. BBQ was not like Mc Donald ! As all the pleasure we could found on our life, more rare it is, better it is. Do this only with the real desire to do it.  For those who have finish to read this post, you could read again it and replace all the "BBQ" word by something like "Making love" and you will have my real thought. But it works with BBQ too ;)

         I found my life so boring before, and since two week I had no time to do something boring. It's so exciting lol So Saturday, we tried to made Muffins, we tried many different recipe with cinnamon, chocolate , maple syrup, honey, banana, etc... 12 muffins for the morning. We spent all the afternoon in town for shopping, and on evening, we tried another recipe for muffins. 24 muffins more. We made a BBQ the evening, we watched a great film (The schindler list) with tea and muffins of course. Sunday Morning, I had tried a new fabulous muffins recipe found on the internet. We made only 12 muffins this time. I ridded my trial motorcycle the morning, we had make a BBQ again (with a nice Tsatsiky sauce) with my wife's family. We worked on the garden the afternoon, and I play a little to game computer (dungeon siege) before the evening BBQ. We had took tea with muffins watching Soccer on TV French / England, shouting against English who doesn't really play soccer (Ouppsss) and shouting more when France win in the 3 last minutes of the match (Yesssssssssss). Sorry for English people I really love :D.  I forget to explain that we have made love many times (perhaps coz the 17 th birthday), but I'll give more explanation in an another post (mdrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ) So it's a great week-end, this evening, I'm sure we'll try a new recipe. Does someone like muffins ??? PS: Its the real pics of our muffins. Nice isn't it ?

         As I explain in the last post, Friday was our 17 th meeting birthday. I had bought a gift for her, and she was furious about the shop where she bought my gift, because she placed an order, and finally they haven't the gift (I'm sure it was the Arsenal soccer team's T-shirt). On Evening, we went to a  Lebanon restaurant. It was very good, and we are alone in the restaurant. We spent a nice evening, and she decided to talked about... Child adoption. How she could talk about this only one week after she explain me that she doesn't love me like before ??? Is it a test ??? I haven't lie, I couldn't think to adopt when I'm not sure that we will spend all of our life together. So she said it's something she couldn't do alone. She thought I'm not someone who could have a baby because I'm too interesting by myself. Hostility was open, I don't play the game. Ok, Perhaps I am a selfish person, but it's not why I doesn't want a child now. One hours later she said it's ok for her because she doesn't want a baby, she prefer to live like this... Don't think she was mad, in each of this question, she tried to found what I really want and what she want for her. If I said I wand a baby, she probably think it was better for her to leave me alone to found another woman. I can imagine how is it hard for her to think it was is fault. She asked me If I am angry about her because we can't have baby. I explained that it's not is fault one thousand time, but I did it again. After the meal, we decided to go home because a great storm coming (I'm fascinate by the power of a storm) So it began raining when we left the restaurant and 30 Kilometers after we were at home and we was wet through (Did I explain we had took her motorcycle ???).  Saturday morning, she explain me she haven't slept. She thought about all of this (I don't know why, but when she think about something like this, I'm afraid) Saturday night, she said "Do you want to speak ?" (oh my atheistic god...) She explained she love me, she had thought about all of this and she wanted to do all it will be possible to continue to live together.  It's ok for me ! Stop thinking and live !  She explained me a last thing: She had the answer to my question (I don't know I had a question :s) The answer is "yes, it's possible"  "But what is the question ?" I asked  ?. Question was "Is it possible to lived with someone all the life with feeling like we have ?" In fact my real question was "Is it possible to stop thinking and live our life while we alway have (I really think we have)love feeling?" She had question and answers, she think for me, she planed our life, she do like she alway did. It's my wife, and I love her like this.  Happy birthday me amor !

         1997: My first website, I was game programer, and I had bought a video acquisition card. With the card there is a software (VDO Phone) for video conference. I plug my Camcorder on the card and connectmy computer to Internet by 56k modem.. biiibidibidi...bididididid (it's the 56k connection, wait... wait again...) You are connected ! YESSSS.. And after ??? 200 people was connected to the server...In the 10 first call, nine of us was men (In fact I supposed it was men because I don't show their faces, they played with their... Sure you understand me...) The day after, I called again some people on line (I could be stubborn when I want), and I found Jo.  Jo is a woman (and me a man I know, it's alway like that), living to Delray Beach near Miami. She visited France few month later (with his Husband, ok ?), so we speak about is journey. She undestand my poor english (like you), sometimes I need to speak with my hand (don't forget it was a video conference, I can't do this here sorry). We spoke again the day after, and the day after... Finally 6 month later, we (me and my wife) took plane for miami (I could say that we had prayed to be sure there is someone who waiting us to the Miami airport :s).  I think it was one of my best hollyday. Jo and Scott change my (stupid french) opinion about american people. They are absolutely lovely. Since this time, I had visited other friend over the world and they had visited us. I had many friends now and they are real friends in my real life... I had just a question now... Where I could go this summer ???? Mouahahaha :)

         Tomorrow, 11 June. It will be 17 years that I met my wife. This 25 June I will be 34 old year. I had spend the half of my life with her. I can say that I'll be someone different if I haven't met her. She alway push me to be better in my job and in my life, she alway said how much she was pround of me.  It's right that since one year things are different. I'm not his hero, but I did things for that... So tomorrow is an important birthday for us, and I have no idea for a gift :s I must found something nice, last day was very nice with her, I'm happy of this even if I know "Up & down" was not finish yet. I need to positive the situation !

         Nice Week-end I had. First, we spend Saturday evening with friends of mine to a BBQ. French BBQ are different because we drink wine, not beer. So I drunk, white wine, pink wine, red wine...OUppPPSsss Sunday morning, the bedroom turned over my bed many time before I could not stand up. And Sunday was a great day, because it's our Trial Motorcycle's day. I don't know if you know this mechanical sport, but it's my favorite sport. So imagine you take a very light motorcycle, a big rock, a young and very beautiful and courageous pilot (me for example), and you just explain to the pilot that he MUST climb the rock or this two favorite friends will laughed about him all the week. So it was a very funny Sunday with sun, forest, mountain, friends, BBC again, NO WINE, and a lot of philosophical discussion about the word, the Internet, you (I often talk about you ;)), and why rocks are so great this Sunday....  -->

         I'm going to cinema tonight ! Harry potter ! I had just finished the book number five, it's really the best of all. I know it was normally for kid, but I'm a great kid :$ There is in Harry Potter story a thing that Dumbledore used (and Rogue too in the number 5), who's called "Pensine" I don't know if the world is the same in English. It's a recipient where you can put all your thought. In fact I had the same thing, it's..... My blog !!!! Yes, I put all my thought here, and I could read it later. Funny no ???  If you want to read an interview of J.K. Rowling, read it here, it's in English and in French, and it's a great French  Website about HP Story    Interview de J.K. Rowling du 4 mars 2004

         I had talked a lot about my private problems in the last post and it help me to feel better now. But I would like to talk about differents things now, like my way of life, the "French" point of view on other country, etc... Today, I would talk about.... Religion. I just want to express my point of view, so be cool, I judge no one, I just talk for me.  So I'm an atheistic catholic (funny no ?) It's a fact, If you want that a religion grow quickly, the simple things to do is to automatic convert baby, they never said "No ! I want to choose my religion later!"  So I'm catholic by obligation and I found that the way of life of catholic is a good things. I said "Way of life" because for me, people who had invented our religions are good people who just want to try to give a good way of life to our nation.  Catholic have tried to give some good advice like "don't hurt other people, love them" or "choose a wife and only one ;), for the better and the worse", and I'm ok so I try to do things like that.  But why they try to promise me the heaven ???  Is not enough to said "Do this and the life of everybody will be better ?" It seems that no. But how I could believe to heaven, a place that no one can talk, and where all is good. For me Heaven is here and now. After, there is nothing, and it's why things you do in your life was so important.  How I can believe that a man had walked on water an had rose from the dead (word is ressuscitate I think)??? If someone on TV news said that a man had rose from the dead, who could believe it ??? Not me it's sure ! In France, how many people pray on Sunday ? 2, 3 or 5 % ???? In a world where science could explain so many things, how do you want that I believe in a god who made the earth in 7 day ? Sorry, it will be possible 200 years ago, but now... Reincarnation is a better idea than heaven, I found it's a nice idea, I think it was in Buddhism religion, and a lot of people in France like this religion, another good advice is to protect all things on earth (insect, animal, plants, human, etc.). I had too many things to said about religion, but not enough time. My conclusion is that religion had helped us to build our society with good advice but there is limit to this concept that it seems we have reached. My own religion is very simple, I can do what I want to be happy if it hurt no one else.  I don't lie (if I can :s).  I help people who need me.  And the more important things is to protect all the other nature creation because it's the only real heaven that I could leave to my children (or children of my friends ;)).  Hope no one was insulted by my point of view, and in the other case, read again your religion advice, I'm sure there is something written that you need to be tolerant with people who doesn't think like you ;)

         Have you the expression "I haven't 107 year..." in your country ? Perhaps it is a French expression "Je n'est pas cent sept ans !" It means that we haven't time to wait. But why 107 years ???? I don't know, it is funny in fact. It's Up & Down actually. Yesterday I had spend my day to think to our discussion about our feeling, I was very stressed. And after the job, all was OK, she was happy, and me relieve. But question run in my head. "How we could live this new situation???". I went to bed at 1:00 pm, and she went just after, we made love as it is the first time, we was happy, so strange to feel happy after a so special discussion the day before. This morning, I thinking to this (I think in English since a begin this blog :s) and she was angry (don't ask me why, I don't know) She said that I must say what I want, because she haven't 107 year, and if we are boring by our life, perhaps it's time to separate (I had a problem with this verb, not sure is the good). She said that she can't bear to think that she doesn't love me like before, it's a too great frustration. Today, she goes to his doctor for her rare disease, it's a very good doctor, it's a friend of us now (she invited us this week-end to a Barbecue), and I think she will discuss about disease and about our private life. I think my wife ask to this doctor what she must do. I don't know what I must do myself, If she decide for us, it should be finished in two days. I will see this evening, I think if we have a chance, it's now, not when all will be finished.

         For those who have read my blog, you know that I feel sad and I found my life boring. I was afraid cause I don't know what my wife feel about all of this... This night, at 1:00 am my wife ask me &quot;Do you want to speak ?&quot; It was quiet, we speak about our boring life (in fact she speak, cause I'm not very courageous :s) I listen her. She said that she love me, but not like before, we have spend 17 year together (the half of our live) and we know that nothing new could happened to us... I confirm that it was the same thing for me I really  love her but it's not enough...So she (it's always she) suggest two solutions : 1 - We try again to live together, in case of it was only a bad period 2 - We separate. The end of our perfect love story. She thinks I can build another life with another woman and have children, but she thinks it's impossible for her, cause she can't have children.  At this time, we cry together... I haven't said that we must separate for two things, the first it's I'm not sure it was really finished, the second it's I 'm like this, a bad guy who doesn't want to take his responsibility.  So we haven't took decision, we just know that we feel the same things and it's hard to think it's perhaps the beginning of the end.  Now, I'm waiting... I cry sometimes, and sometimes I dream about my future, I think the first thing I'll do is to take one month to visit England alone and to try to perfect my English...  It was an important moment of my life, and it's now...

         I write in (a bad) English and so many people understand me that I though it's a miracle. You read me from London, Honk Kong, Manila, Skelleftea and Paris. The next step in human civilization will be the universal language. English is this language, and internet the process accelerator.  My grandfather is 101 year old and he often talk me about all technical evolution happened in 100 year (car, fridge, TV, nuclear energy, etc.) It was so interesting to watch and live all this evolution, and to try to imagine what our future will be in 50 year. I 'm happy to live this and afraid to learn how we destroy a part of this planet to progress again. It's so interesting to talk with you at the other side of the planet, and in same time, I don't know who is the guy who lived on the other side of my street.  So I need to learn english, be cause it will be the inInternationnal langage, and if one day the guy who lived on the other side of my street has a blog, I could take a rendez-vous with him to take a beer at home... Isn't it ???  Don't forget to leave me messages and blogg adress because I like to know what people do on the other side of my dear planet. Mother Earth, I love you...

             My dog killed a little cat last week, he jumped over the wall and killed him. Nature is hard sometimes...  I saw a traffic accident friday, a motorbike had hit a car and the motorbike's rider was lieing down on the road near the fire-engine (in France it's the firemen who carry injured people to hospital). I think about this guy very often when I ride my motorbike now, life is so fragile...  I spend a lot of time to playing on the computer at home, and I had a lot of work to do before the end of the week at my office.  Yesterday, I had went to the motorbike trials with my best friends. I was very cautious, but my technique was not good enough and I fell again :s. It wasn't like last time, but I hit one of my fingers and I have some problems clicking my mouse today.  It will be my wife's birthday on wednesday, I had looked for an original present, but it wasn't that easy to find. I finally bought a parachute jump, with a tandem jump at 4.000 meters with 50 seconds of free fall before opening the parachute. I think we'll go on august 2.  I'll be on holliday all of August, I think we will visit Marseille and we shall go on a soccer match with the new Marseille team. I'm looking for a one week holliday in tunisia with thallassotherapie hostel.  And That's all ;)      Corrected by Mike da hat;)

           "Extraordinaire !!!!" That's what my best friend said about my fall a few minutes after I fell from a large rock. It was the first time since I've been riding trial bikes that I have fallen like this. In fact I really flew on the air for 1 or 2 seconds, after this, I had hit the rock again and my motorbike fell on me, hurting my leg. My best friend who waited while I climbed the rock ran to help me, his face was as white as a sheet, he was frightened and he took me in his arms, until he was sure I hadn't broken anything. I don't think I can ride my motorbike for another two weeks, because I had problems walking today.  I'll remember this day really well only because I didn't have time to be afraid and because I know that all my friends will talk about this fall like "the best fall of the year 2004". I sincerely hope it will be the best fall of my life. I need to be more cautious next time, I was lucky last time, thank my lucky stars.    Corrected by Mike da hat;)

         How is it possible to be so nice a dog at home and a perfect engine of war in the garden ? My dog can do that, He's called Fox, perhaps because he is a fox-terrier. So Let me give you his day's program of yesterday. 8:30 he woke up slowly from the sofa. 8:40 he finished my milk-coffee with 2 muffins 9:00 / 11:30 he played on the garden with Sony (a dog friend of him) 11:31 he saw the two of the neighbours  cats and jumped other the wall to kill them.  12:30 the neighbour who caught Foxy in his house with the two cats threw him into our garden. He had a lot of blood on his face, scratched by cats. 13:00 / 17:00 He played with Sony to kill a snake in the wood, and left the dead snake at front of our house 18:00 he played with his mom and dad (me and my wife) 20:00 he ate a lot and watched TV with us 21:00 he played in the garden and found a hedgehog. 21:45 he came back home with the dead hedgehog (4 th hedgehog this year) a lot of blood on his face and a lot of fleas (des puces tesa !) 22:00 / 23:00 he took a shower with me and didn't like it.  That's all, this dog is like a child to us, we really love him, but how can I explain to him that killing hedgehogs, snakes, and cats isn't a good thing ??? If someone speaks French dog language, could he help us ? PS: Before Foxy killed his first hedgehog, I though hedgehogs had a perfect defense system against all predators except car wheels. It seems fox-terrier was another danger for us. Sorry to all the hedgehog family living near our house. Really sorry, Keep Out, Mad Dog at home.  corrected by Mike da hat;) (Thanks a lot Mike)
