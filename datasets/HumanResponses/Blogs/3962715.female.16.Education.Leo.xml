        I'm back!! Yes, I love it here lol.&nbsp; I want to say thanks to everyone at Fanbolt for welcoming me!&nbsp; Britney, Chloe, Joy, Malfoy, Kristen, Rob, Caroline, Alexa, Tamara and Anji!&nbsp; Thanks, guys!!       &nbsp;   I really didn't say a ton about me before, but that's because I'm not too complicated.&nbsp; Nothing like ogres or onions&nbsp;(sorry for the Shrek reference)!! I'm like a little kid deep down and I'm immature when I want to be.&nbsp; My fave movie is really serious but I also live for Pirates of the Caribbean, Anchorman, Shrek and The Lion King.&nbsp; My youngest sib is a baby, after all.       &nbsp;   Great blogging again...       &nbsp;   Today, I've slept until 9 a.m., watched my tape of the ULTIMATE Disney Channel movie  Pixel Perfect  and then I did some aerobics before getting online.&nbsp; I love just hanging out during the summer.&nbsp; I'll be a junior next year... which'll stink.&nbsp; Senior year I think you do less work... that's what my friend Autumn said, anyway.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   Don't you think that's a pretty name?&nbsp; Autumn.&nbsp; I wish I was named something that cool.&nbsp; Summer, Winter, Autumn... not spring.&nbsp; That's an odd&nbsp;name (no offense if that's your first name!!!) It's a nice last name, though.&nbsp; Melanie Spring... that could work.&nbsp; Nope, I'm waiting for Melanie Brody, Melanie Ullman, Melanie McCartney... ooh, that last one is nice!&nbsp; I'd be Jesse's wife, not Paul's.&nbsp; LOL.       &nbsp;   Thanks for listening!! Today I'm buying my Maria Mena CD!! WHOO HOO!!

         Hey everyone, I just created my very own blog!! Well, I guess the best way to start is by saying something about me... my name is Melanie, and I will be 16 in 2 1/2&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp; I live in&nbsp;New Hampshire with my mom, stepdad, 2 sisters, my kitten&nbsp;Mira&nbsp;and 1 half-brother.&nbsp; My dad lives in New York and we don't visit him unless it's Hanukkah.&nbsp; My favorite singer is Maria Mena, who sings "You're the Only One".&nbsp; I also like Michelle Branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria's CD comes out Tuesday, so I'm psyched.&nbsp; My favorite movie is  Where the Heart Is .&nbsp; My favorite actress is Amber Tamblyn, and my favorite show is  Joan of Arcadia .&nbsp; My&nbsp;favorite place in the world is my room, where I write&nbsp;song lyrics and&nbsp;play my guitar.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't wait to&nbsp;blog some more, but I have to go.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;
