             For someone who depends on the fast food customer to bring a paycheck in, I sure am developing a dislike for them.  I can be extremely impatient with customers. Like, when I'm holding a heavy crate of ketchup, but I can't put it away because a customer is blocking off the condiment stand, pondering for extended periods of time on the exact number of napkins and ketchup packets they need. Or the customers who spill soda all over the floor, and then make it worse by putting paper napkins all over, trying to "help", of course. And kids. Kids are the worst. You trip over them whichever way you turn, and their parents make no effort whatsoever to control them.   I especially dislike customers who come in groups. Sports teams, youth groups, sororities, birthday parties. Can't stand em'. They push the tables around and rearrange chairs so that you can hardly tell what order the furniture started out in. They leave gym socks and cupcake wrappers everywhere, and generate more noise and more mess than one hundred people would have license to. And they all get up at one time, making it impossible to catch up on cleanup for the next few hours. Big groups throw my whole routine off. If they had any consideration for my well-being, they would take turns coming in in units of 3-5 customers.  But the worst customer of all is, well, not a customer at all. It is the un-customer, the person who comes in from the deli next door or the barbecue restaraunt accross the street- after purchasing their meal there. It may sound unreal, but these people will actually march into the restaraunt, take-out in hand, sit down at one of my clean tables, and make as big a mess as any paying customer. Shameless.  Well, I suppose I will end my rant here. After all, it is the customer(but not the un-customer!) who keeps the money coming in for me. I just get a bit frustrated sometimes. but, if you are an obnoxious fast food customer, please do a few things for me: 1. Keep your kids under control 2. Try to clean up after yourself, BUT, 3. Do not try to clean up spills. Contact the dining room employee, as they have access to a mop. 4. Never make use of a restaraunt facility unless you are planning on purchasing food there. 5. Do not spend excessive amounts of time in front of the condiment stand. Get what you need, and leave. It's okay if you end up with a couple extra straws. 6. Never, EVER, leave sweaty gym socks on the restaraunt floor! Thanks!!!

      This morning I went into work, and checked the roster. As usual, my eyes immediatly gravitated towards the "Dining room" slot, and I was astonished to discover an abscence of my name in that box. My first thoughts were that I had never been scheduled for that day and my being there was a complete result of my own stupidity and inability to correctly check a schedule, but before I turned to leave, I happened to notice I was down for Register Five. I was immediately overtaken with gratitude, thinking some kind and caring manager had taken pity on me and wanted to give me a break from dining room, and those thoughts seemed confirmed when a manager double-checked to make sure I was okay with having a less-familiar duty. I said yes, and he told me he would help me better re-familiarize myself with the register after I clocked in.  So, I sat down and sipped my iced tea, waiting for my clock-in time to come. I noticed another manager approaching me, roster in hand, and I felt even nicer, assuming she wanted to also make sure I was comfortable with my task. "How nice," I thought. "Maybe these people care about me after all".  "Bekah, I just wanted to let you know that we accidentally wrote your name down for register. You're going to be on dining room today, okay?" What she meant to say: "Bekah, some manager went temporarily insane and thought he would make you responsible for handling money and talking to customers and getting people's orders straight and running a cash register, and, (laughs) we  all  know that would be a huge disaster since you are a complete idiot and you never get anything right and the only reason you are still working here is beacuse we can't find a solid reason to fire you that would pass with the operator, but we are working on that. So you need to stay out in the dining toom and out of our way so we won't have to think about you and maybe we can forget you exist,  OK ?"  Okay, so maybe that was a  little  exaggarated. But still, it was rather dissapointing-especially since I have been with them for almost a year now, and I don't feel that they trust me to do anything but clean up after people. Our operator has reassured me that they just happen to like having me on dining room, but if that was so, how come I never get more than two shifts a week? My job has been a bit frustrating and monotonous lately, and it's hard to imagine myself working there for over three more years-until I graduate. I don't know if I'll make it. It's not looking very hopeful now. But atleast, if you happen to stop by Chick-fil-a on a Saturday, you'll know  exactly  where to find me.

      Today, I got up, picked up my dirty chick-fil-a uniform off of my floor, and carried it to the laundry room, meaning to wash it. I was home alone(or, I thought I was), and I knew we had a box of detergent, so I reached up in the cabinet and...it wasn't there. So I turned to the freshly-purchased warehouse-club bucket of detergent(you know...the size that could keep a laundromat going for a year). I assumed that, since my dad had been doing laundry, surely he had opened the bucket. Apparently not. So, naturally, I tried to pry the lid off. Nothing. And I tried again. Again, nothing. If I didn't know better, I would assume that the good people at Wind Fresh had a little fun with the crazy glue- I'm still baffled as to how exactly that lid was supposed to come off. So, since it was only a plastic lid, I went in the kitchen and got a really big knife. Nothing. So, I went and got some really heavy-duty scissors. The kind that are actually called shears. Again, nothing. So, I sat back and pondered on it for a while, and concluded that maybe I could punch holes through the top with a hammer and nail. So, I found a hammer and a nice, big nail, and I returned to the bucket. I set the nail firmly against the bucket, and I hammered...and hammered...and hammered...and...nothing. I was desperate now. I turned the hammer to the nail-puller side and began beating aggressively on the top of the bucket. When I calmed down a bit, I noticed I had made a small dent. So I kept beating. I'm not sure how long it took, but after a while I had weakened a small part of the lid enough to make two side-by-side nail holes, and then I used the puller to pry them open just a little bit more. Finally, there was a big enough hole that I could turn the bucket on it's side and watch the powder trickle into the cup-slowly, very slowly. So, when my cup was about halfway full, my brother appeared.  "Are you OK?" he asked.  "Yeah, I'm fine. Just needed to do some laundry."  He surveyed the situation, and then, of all the nerve, he asked,  "Why didn't you just open the bucket?"

       Today, it suddenly occured to me that my first semester of high school is only one week away from being over. Most people are really psyched about it, but I'm totally depressed, and I wasn't sure why until I really thought about it.  First of all, my summer looks pretty boring. I will have Young Life camp, for which I have worked hard to earn money and almost wiped out what I had saved. It's going to be an awesome week, and I look forward to it. And hopefully, I'll get some extra hours at work. But other than that, my summer looks pretty bleak. So, I suppose that may put a damper on my summer joy. But there is more than that.  Last December and January, before I started school, I made a careful list of my priorities and expectations for myself. One was to be a straight A student. That dream faded in algebra class. Second, to make friends. Unfortunately, I found that just being a nice person really isn't enough, even in the world of "mature" highschoolers. And the third, and probably most important goal I set, was to be a shining witness for Christ in every situation. Three strikes, I'm out.  This was the one where I really messed up. As far as grades and friends went, I put out almost my best effort. But I feel that if I had put more of a focus on my spiritual life, God might have prospered me more in those areas as well. I screwed up.  I'm not really sure where it started. I am in a great new church where I have no right not to grow. I have a strong knowledge of scripture, and I have a God who has seen me through all kinds of tough situations. I had this awesome oppurtunity to let people see what being a Christian should be about, and I've blown it. I go to school with the same attitude and the same priorities as anyone else. I talk about people the same ways anyone else would. I spend virtually no time praying, except for a few hurried words at bedtime, and whenever I happen to need help with an algebra test. And in the few areas where I have succeeded, I have failed to give God the glory. I have not been a glowing example of God's love-I have been a typical high schooler. I almost regret that I've let anyone know I was a Christian, because it can't be good for God's reputation.  In short, this year has been an utter dissapointment. It's all been my fault. I can only hope and pray that i do some serious maturing over the summer, and I know that will only be possible if I spend some serious time with God. I pray that this school year will end another unsuccessful chapter of my life, so I will have a chance to improve for next year. And I pray, most of all, that people will be able to forget what a lousy Christian I was this year. I'm sorry, Father, that I failed you again.

      4:45 AM- I drag myself out of bed and jump straight into the shower.  6:00 AM- My mom was going to take me to school this morning, but she said that since I was in such a bad mood, I had better take the bus. So after skimming the newspaper headlines, I go out and sit in the minivan to wait for the bus and finish the last little bit of my homework.  6:23 AM- I climb onto the big, bumpy, rickety schoolbus, where I am trapped for the next 35 minutes. I despise the bus.   6:58 AM- I arrive at school, stand outside till the bell rings at 7, and head down to my locker. Since most people are coming out of the gym, where you are really supposed to go before 1st bell, I have to fight my way through the traffic to get back there for PE.  7:30 AM- My PE teacher is out, so we get one of the baseball coaches for a sub. Usally subs are okay, but this guy gets on my nerves. Most of the girls think he's really hot, but I think he's annoying, and that he flirts with highschool girls way too much. Luckily, he's distracted most of the period, so some of the girls who were closest to the television fast-forwarded through some of the Tae-Bo video. I would have fast-forwarded a lot more, but I was in the back. Oh well. Atleast we didn't have to do Richard Simmons today.  After we finished the video and our ab work, I tried to play badminton. It was pretty hilarious. I couldn't even serve the birdie. I have to be the most un-coordinated person I know.  8:53 AM- I head on to 2nd block. Today I made all the effort I could not to answer all the questions that I was able to, becuase I always feel like such a World History nerd in there. I'm terrified of getting on people's nerves.   10:30 AM- I got to see my boyfriend before algebra class, which was nice since I hate algebra, so anything to make going to algebra class a little less miserable is awesome.   It's gotten to the point where I can barely try to focused in that class. The year is almost over, and all I can think of is how honors algebra has wrecked my GPA. I am going to be so relieved to have that behind me, so I can work to get my grades back up. I'm going to really need to make straight A's next year.  12:40 PM- We were doing some sort of heat energy formula, but it was all I could do to stay awake. I have got to start getting more sleep. I think I figured the formula out right at the end of class.  2:15 PM- I climb on the bus and promptly go to sleep. Almost to sleep, that is. I was just awake enough to hear the bus driver tell someone to wake me up when we were getting closer to my stop. I'm glad I was awake, because that would have been embarassing.  3:55 PM- I get off the bus. Since I didn't have any money at lunch, I find something to eat, go to work on my algebra, and end up falling asleep.   5:45 PM- My sister wakes me up for dinner. Then everyone else heads to church, but I stay home to finish my homework. Again, I really have to start getting more sleep.  7:45- I get on the computer to update my blog. And that's what I've been doing ever since. I think my boyfriend is going to call me in a little while. Hopefully we can do something this weekend so I won't be totally bored. Anyways, that was my day.

      I went to see "Troy" last night. It was awesome...and almost all of the guys in it were absolutely beautiful. I hated the character of Paris though. He was such an immature wimp, but Orlando Bloom did a good job, even though it actually didn't turn out to be the biggest role. Sean Bean did great as Odysseus, too.   Guys aside though, it was a really great movie. There actually wasn't too much completely disgusting violence, not as much as I expected at least. I mean, it freaked me out, but I'm extra squeamish about blood. And the sex scenes were pretty intense. So just close your eyes. But go see it for yourself- it's almost worth the seven dollar movie ticket!

      This will most likely become a regular feature on my blog. Because some people may be curious about what it truly means to have a boring life.  6:50 AM: I awoke to my mom opening my door. I jumped up, looked at the clock, and started to panic. I usally get up at 4:30 to catch the bus at 6:20. School starts at 7:15. I dash to the shower.  7:05 AM: After halfway blow-drying my hair, I jump into the van and my mom begans speeding towards the school as I try to slap some make-up on and put my hair up so I don't look too scary when I arrive at school with my first-ever tardy.  7:18 AM: I run across campus and sneak into the gym. My PE teacher doesn't see me- my perfect attendance is safe.  7:30 AM: We began doing yoga-style stretches. I believe the woman instructing us said something to the effect of: "Relax your muscles and sway...pretend you are a jellyfish..." It was hard not to crack up. Luckily, we got R&R since it was Friday. In addition to over 2 hours extra sleep, I got a 45-minute nap. Life is good.  8:53 AM: Head to 2nd period. Had to stop and turn in a late assignment in algebra. I was supposed to turn it in after school yesterday, but I was running late and would have missed my bus. My teacher didn't sympathize with that. As I tried my best to apologize, she just snapped a "Yeah" at me. I ran along to my 2nd period. We had a sub, and just busywork to do. And then I sat and took apart all my pens and put them back together. It was a lot of fun.  10:30 AM: I have to go to my algebra class for three minutes before I head to lunch. I avoid looking at the teacher. Did I mention she was scary...?  Because of the rush this mrning, I forgot all my lunch money. Didn't even have a dime to get ice water. And my stomach was grumbly. I really need to stop turning my alarm off in my sleep...  11:10 AM: My algebra teacher lectured us about paying attention and using the right methods to solve our problems. She was looking straight at me. Oh, how I wanted to raise my hand and inform her that she was being obvious enough. She could go ahead and call me by name.  12:40 PM: I love 4th block, Physical Science. We don't have to do anything- it's an automatic A as long as you appear to be paying attention. It gets kind of boring sometimes, but it is a huge relief after algebra.  Today we had 17 problems, and the whole class period to do them. Gosh, I love that class.   2:15 PM: School is finally out. As we are walking down the hall, the janitor's cell phone starts to ring, and a boy behind me starts calling, very loudly, "Hey, REBEKAH, is that your CELL PHONE I hear? I think your CELL PHONE is ringing." Yeah, so it's against school policy to have cell phones on campus. I could have killed him.  3:00 PM: I finally get home on the bus. It's pouring outside, so I rush to the door, only to find it locked and no one home. And I have no key. After calling my mom, who was 3 hours away, and trying every door, I end up popping a window screen out and managing to pry the window open. I was born to be a burglar.  3:30-9:45 PM: Basically, I've done nothing. I've watched tv and chatted on the computer. That's about it.

      My algebra teacher is scary. She has poofy, frizzy white hair and pale, wrinkly skin that is stretched tightly accross her skull, and has a sort of purplish tone to it. She wears purple eyeshadow and dark red lipstick, but no other make-up. She wears jumpers that flare way out around her feet, and tiny leather tennis shoes. She's hard to describe, but she reminds me of a witch. Awful, I know, but it's just the truth.   She's mad at us before we come into the room. She's standing there scowling as we take our seats. I sit on the first row, and when everyone passes their homework up, she snatches the papers out of my hand as soon as I touch them. She couldn't be but 5 feet tall, yet she is the most intimidating presence in the school. And, she hates me.    She has hated me since my second day of school, when I changed from regular algebra to her honors class. As soon as the guidance counseler told her I would be joining the class, she looked straight at me and said, "Oh, no."  And that was how I was introduced to her. She has plagued my life ever since.   However, while I am suffering in the area of algebra, I  have actually learned several things in her class:  1. I will never, ever wear purple eyeshadow 2. If, when I am a teacher, I ever get to the point where I hate my students, I am going to end my career, for my sake and their's. 3. Spraying students with a water bottle is an effective way to end their mid-class nap, and serves as entertainment for the other students in a typically dull class. 4. Algebra does not bring happiness. 5. I must never, ever, take an honors math course again. 6. I am SO ready for summer!

      Well, this will be my last post until I get back from camp on the 4th. Time to rant about my job.  So, I ask off for tomorrow, right? Because I'm leaving for camp at 7. Without specifying what time I would be leaving, I asked off. I just said I was going to camp that day. And a certain manager who seems bent on making my life miserable(the same one who cut me back to one shift a week) scheduled me anyway...for 10-4. So I can work but...I still wish that he had honored my request. Like, what was I supposed to do, just say "Hey, I guess I'll skip this camp that I've put all my money towards!"? I dunno. But it bothers me. So I drew a nice, thick black line through the next week and circled the word "OFF". I guess he got it, because he didn't schedule me. But, I get to work all day tomorrow, then go home, shower, and catch the bus to camp. Fun stuff. It wouldn't actually, though, be a problem, except that I asked off and gave a good reason. Grrrr...  So, another complaint. I turned 16, right? And my one year anniversary was earlier this month so, according to policy, I should get paid on my birthday. But...my birthday wasn't even in the newsletter. And I'm still in workgroup 4, with the 15 year olds. So, I'm gonna have fun with it tomorrow. I'm gonna climb a ladder, because i always had to ask other people to do it when I was 15(Chick-fil-a has a rule that you can't climb a ladder till you are 16). And then they'll get on to me about it. That will be fun.  Anyways, that's my day tomorrow. And then I get out of the house and Chick-fil-a and this whole crummy town for the week to hang out in the Rockies!!!

      Really, I feel pretty old. 16 always seemed like some kind of big, important number to me. It doesn't really feel that important now, but I do feel like an elderly person looking back on their childhood years and wondering why they didn't make better use of them. Luckily, I know I still have a good bit more time left. So, my birthday has been alright. I went to Penney's this morning and found two pairs of shorts and a cute shirt, and then we went to Claire's. They had buy two get one earrings, so I got some little colored hoops and some different colored studs and some white star-shaped hoops. And I got some sunglasses too. I found some pj's and stuff at Target and then we got all of the little neccessities from Wal-Mart. I never found any tennis shoes, though. Have to keep looking.  When we got home, Mom gave me a gift basket with the Hollywood Pink perfume I've been wanting, and all the lotions and soaps that go with it. And I still have some birthday money left to take to camp with me. And, best of all, I'm not totally depressed!!!  Well, that's been my birthday. Not all that exciting, just a lot of new stuff. And now I'm going to just spend the rest of the week being impatient for camp.

      Well, I didn't go to take my permit test yet. And although my mom said she'd take me on my birthday, it doesn't look like that is going to happen anytime soon. Oh, well. I'm not all that surprised.  Anyways, we were going to go to the mall to go birthday shopping, but there was an incident in our mall for the second time recently. A couple months ago someone was snatched in the parking lot, yesterday they were chasing this guy who stole someone's purse, and he started shooting up the food court. Mom says she would rather take me to the big mall about an hour and a half away. Fine by me! Our mall has, like, nothing.  I got two birthday presents last night! A couple of my new friends from church got presents for me. A really cute stuffed cat and a little butterfly-shaped clock. I thought that was so sweet, especially since I have only known them for a few months!  Well, that's about it. I gave my shift for tomorrow to someone, so I guess I'll help with the Young Life carwash tomorrow.

       Okay, so I can't post today and just totally say that my summer is entirely boring. I haven't really left the house all week, but things look a little better. I have youth tonight, permit test tomorrow, work Saturday, church Sunday, my birthday Monday, and then the next Saturday I leave for Young Life camp in Colorado. And I have all kinds of shopping I have to get done for camp.  Mom is taking me shopping Monday for my birthday. I did the same thing last year, just picked out my presents instead of unwrapping them. I guess that is okay, I still have a few  gift s to unwrap from relatives, although most of them give me money. That doesn't bother me, I know I'm hard to shop for. Besides, I get depressed on my birthday and don't like a lot of attention. I don't know why, exactly.   I guess I do, sort of, though. When I was little, I always dreamed about being 16. You know, driving myself to the mall, hanging out with friends. And now I'm 16, and nothing is as I wished it to be. But that's enough of that, I am starting to depress myself, and it's not even my birthday yet,  Anyways, I think I'll feel a lot better when i get back from camp. I'll get to try tons of new stuff and get to know people from my school. So it'll probably help a lot. Not to mention spending some much-needed time away from my family and a great chance to get closer to God, who has seemed more distant these days.

      Wow... This first bit of Summer Break has been boring, frustrating, and depressing. I am already counting down the days till late August when I get to go back.  I've been thinking a lot about clothes(pathetic, I know). I am well aware I won't have much money(Young Life Camp has totally depleted my funds). This last semester I tried really hard to look sharp with all the American Eagle and whatever, but most of the other girls who wear that stuff had way more than me. And I was never really comfortable. I know clothes don't make the person, but I think they should reflect the personality. So I'm gonna have some fun this year. Mostly just jeans and inexpensive tees, but stuff that reflects me and my musical tastes and...whatever. And, I really want to learn how to skateboard. I don't really know what that has to do with anything. And I want to get my nose pierced, and am planning to do so. I think I'lll make most of my own  jewelry  and stuff. I am going to try making some guitar string jewelry. Anyways, that is just something that I've been thinking about. Anyways, I am going to be a lot more frugal in my wardrobe this year, and maybe I can save up for a  car !!! Maybe...

      Well, I got my report card today.  It wasn't as bad as I feared. Two A's, one B, and a fat, ugly C for algebra. Came out to a 3.25 GPA for the semester, giving me a 3.5 for the year. Not too bad, but I wanted to do better. Hopefully next year will bring some major improvement- I would love to be all A's next year. But that will take some major discipline. I hope I'm up to it. But for now, I'm glad to have saved my 3.5.

      I am thinking, quite seriously, about having my nose pierced this summer.  I was already planning on getting a couple more holes in my ears. I gt my first piercings this January, and though I expected it to be awful, it didn't hurt at all. I have always considered my self to have a low tolerance for pain. I've been known to be violent when the doctor said I needed a shot. It took me years just to get the nerve to get my ears done. But that first small piercing is behind me, and this is something I really want.  I've been researching nose piercings. Most people say the pain is quick and not too bad at all, but I'm not entirely sure. I think it may be worth it, though, because I think nose piercings are adorable. And it's not a rebellion or anything. my parents have okayed it, my mom will take me, and sign the form. She wants me to look into it more, and think about it more, which I am doing.  So, it is quite likely to happen. I don't want anything big, just a small stud. Maybe I'll buy some different coloured gems, but I'll probably mostly stick to a clear crystal. And I know some people will be so envious- most parents won't even consider it. So my parents may be sticks-in-the-mud about  dating  and boys(which they have actually loosened up a great deal on, since they know they can trust me in that area). But they will let me get my nose pierced, so they are actually pretty cool. Belly buttons and eyebrows are out of the question, as well as anything in or around the mouth, but that's okay. My nose is what I really want done.  So, it may shock the grandparents, but I'm sure they will love me anyway. If I actually get the nerve, this will be so much fun!

      Well, it's the first day of summer. Sort of. Tomorrow is report card day, but we only have to stay for two hours.  So, it is the first day of summer. I was really depressed at school yesterday, and didn't have the greatest day. I didn't do as well on my exams as I had hoped(Note to self: never again break up with your boyfriend right before exam week. I spent more time crying and writing depressing poetry than studying. I'm pathetic).  Oh, wait, back up a second. Yeah, I broke up with my boyfriend. Communication had died off a bit, and, it seems, his infatuation with me had done the same. It was my fault, I've been an emotional basketcase lately and hadn't put near enough effort into the realationship. So, I wrote him a note, relating my feelings on the matter. I told him that if he saw anything between us worth saving, we needed to talk. But otherwise, he should just let me know, and we would let it go.  Without letting me know, he seems to have chosen the second. So, with that stress, as well as everything related in my last post, summer has looked worse than ever. And now, on the first day, I am home alone, at 10 AM, with my scrambled eggs and coffee, listening to a heavy rainfall. And I wonder what I am going to do with myself for the rest of summer.  A copy of "Mere Christianity" sits on the desk next to me. In Book IV, Chapter 8, CS Lewis explains that in the Christian life, the real problem comes the moment you wake up each morning(and I have only been awake for an hour). "All your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals" Lewis writes, "And the first job each morning consists of simply shoving them all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in. And so on, all day. Standing back from all your natural fussings and frettings, coming in out of the wind."  I still have no idea what I am going to do this summer. But I know that, with all this free time, I am going to do my best to let Christ lead me. If, from the moment I wake each morning these two and a half months, I try to live for Christ, and let Christ live through me, maybe it is a habit I wil be able to carry into the more busy months after mid-August. I think it's something worth aiming for.

      Just got FM Static's cd today. It's awesome. All the songs are about being a teenager and falling in love and stuff and they are totally easy to relate to. I'm loving it. I'm not really sure how many times I've listened to it throughout the day, but I think I may have all the songs memorized already.  Anyways, right now I'm listening to Subseven's "Emotion" right now. That has to be the best headbanging song ever. It's been a pretty long day, just sitting around the house. I got my order in from C28, and the One Truth shirt is gorgeous. I can't wait to wear it. My 6 year-old sister was running around the house all day wearing my stretch terry wristband, my trucker cap, and her nail cross necklace and saying she looked like a Christian rock star. She's so cute.  I'm really kind of nervous about closing at work tomorrow. I have absolutely no idea what to do, so I hope they are patient with me. Anyways, can't think of much to write. But if you are reading this, go buy an FM Static cd.

      So, our computer was down for a couple of days. And now they've fixed it, and I can't get my email account to work, and&nbsp;I can't remember my AIM password. So I am totally without communication today, and this is probably my only time on the computer this week(yeah...my mom probably won't want to over-indulge me by letting me get on twice in a one-week period...so I usally only get Thursdays). So, I'm a little unhappy. &nbsp;So...what has been going on in my life? Not much, I guess. Mostly work. I worked sixteen-and-a-half hours last week, my longest week yet. I got cast-off shifts from a couple of girls who are trying to get ready for college. And on Saturday, I traded for a closing shift. And, I have been on register twice since last Tuesday. Not bad. Oh, and I got a recognition certificate that i get to trade for some kind of prize. For great customer service and getting my trays when my name was called. So, work looks a lot better. &nbsp;So, other than that... I've had church stuff, of course. On Sunday all the youth went to Chuckie Cheese's. That was fun. We are so horribly immature. On Saturday, a friend from work who lives down the street invited me to swim at her house. And on Tuesday, I had a dentist appointment. They scheduled me to have my braces off on Augest eleventh. Of course, I'm elated about that. After they take them off, I'll have enough time to do White Strips before school starts. My teeth will be so beautiful...straight, and white, and no pieces of wire attatched to them with food stuck in. Yeah! &nbsp;And I have been back-to-school shopping. I got an order in from PacSun yesterday. I didn't order clothes from them, but some really cute accesories, and after making fun of the trucker hat I got in the buy-one-get-one accesory sale, my brother said he wanted one, too. And my mom said that my wristbands look like pieces of belt strapped to my arm. Oh well, I like them. I'm still waiting on an order from C28, a christian clothing site. I'm getting a pink One Truth shirt...I'm excited about that. I had to send my Hurley shoes back for a different size, but they are the absolute cutest shoes I have ever seen. And I have five pairs of brand new jeans hanging in my closet. Anyways, that is all quite boring, but I am really enjoying getting ready for school, and finally being able to put together a look that suits my personal taste. &nbsp;So, that's just what has been going on. I am desperately looking forward to getting back to school and having something interesting to write about.

      So, they decided to put me on register. &nbsp;The very nice manager who makes the roster decided I may be a bit burned out on dining room. So, she said they would be re-training me on register. The registers are a good bit different than the last time I worked them. &nbsp;Of course, I was thrilled. I couldn't wait to get started. But, on Tuesday, there was one little problem... Although they did put me on register, they didn't train me. At all. &nbsp;Needless to say, it was a disaster. I spent much of the four-and-a-half hour shift apologizing to customers and managers. I can only guess that&nbsp;I will be back on dining room tomorrow. &nbsp;That's okay. It was nice of them to think of me. Now I'll just go back to doing what I'm good at.

      &nbsp;So, a bit more about camp. I know it was almost three weeks ago, but there's really nothing else to talk about. So, here goes.  When we got to camp, all the staff was in the middle area, square dancing to Rocky Top(haha, very funny). So we got a special Tennessee welcome(and you know, we got teased the rest the week for being Southerners). Anyways, they had the work crew carry our bags for us, which was great for me since I way over-packed.  &nbsp;The camp is gorgeous. Standing in front of our dorm and looking out, there are all the cute log buildings, and then this amazing view of the mountains on every side. The trees were cleared out, so it was nothing but sky and mountains. it was amazing.  &nbsp;And then supper was a huge surprise. Instead of standing in line, as soon as they started playing the music and opened the doors, everyone went into the dining room. And it was a real dining room. Every day, they set the tables with a cloth and often cloth napkins and all that stuff, and they served the food to our tables. It was great. And the coffee was really good. I drank it three times a day. I love coffee.  &nbsp;On the first night, we did an obstacle course in the dark, and I got totally muddy and wet and freezing. It was great. I had mud all over my face, in my hair, everywhere. And the second day, we had a volleyball tournament.&nbsp;I usally hate volleyball, but this was fun. We had the best uniforms, too. Our cabin wore tie-dye t-shirts, bandanna headbands, and we put our hair in pig-tail buns. We were adorable. And we totally should have won for Spirit.  &nbsp;Let's see...I went mountain-luging that afternoon.And I crashed. It was great. I hit the hay-bale and went flying, the luge flipped over me while in the air, and I rolled a bit before jumping up and laughing. The rest of the week I had bruises from mountain-luging. How hard-core is that? The mountain luge guy came racing down the track to see if I was okay. And everyone thought I was hurt or something. I wasn't, but my gosh, I was sore!  &nbsp;On Tuesday, I did the ropes course. I was so terrified, it was hilarious. I had to stop for about three minutes between every part of the course, because I was too shaky to go on. And I said a prayer for every single part. When we got to the part at the end where you have to jump off before they lower you down, I was so freaked out. I had to sit on the edge and slide off. But it was awesome once&nbsp;I stopped falling, and&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I was&nbsp;safely attatched to the cable. I still thought I was going to hit a tree a little, I was swinging so hard, but I made it. It was great, I was so glad I did it.  &nbsp;On Wednesday,&nbsp; after a day of wet, muddy horseback riding(on a mountain...with a very obstinate horse named Haley), we had country night. I hadn't been warned about it, but I had some Levi's to wear, and a tan henley top. A friend let me borrow a bandanna for my neck, and I wore pig-tails and eyeliner freckles. We had a country pot-roast meal and a sing-along, then an opera(which was all like, hit songs. It was pretty funny). Then there was a carnival, and we earned tokens to pie our leaders. And then, there was....another thing.  &nbsp;They lined us all up, boy son one side, girls on the other. And I was begging my friend to tell me what was going on, since she had been to camp before. She knew I was nervous and about to run, so she said, "Oh, we're just going to have chips and salsa".  &nbsp;We didn't. We had a square dance. I was so nervous, I couldn't even talk to the partner they put me with. He was cute, too. I talked to him a couple more times that week, when&nbsp;I wasn't so insecure. I don't know how to dance at all.  &nbsp;It was fun though. I was in a square with both of the other girls from my school, and we all ended up laughing and having a good time. And then we played this game where I ended up slow-dancing with, I think, four cute guys. There was one really tall, tan blonde with great curly hair, and he was singing along to "Hero" by Enrique Iglesias. How cute is that? So the dance wasn't really that bad. Except for during the square dance, when&nbsp;I realized I had&nbsp; a big cool-whip glob on my toe from the carnival.  &nbsp; On Thursday, we had to hike up a mountain. All I will say about the way up is...I realized how out-of-shape I am. That's all anyone needs to know about that. At the top, it was awesome. You could see everything. We took a lot of pictures, and my square dance partner wanted a picture of us. Of course,&nbsp; I had to get one too. It's going to be framed.  No, I'm kidding about that. I'm not THAT much of a weird stalker-type.  &nbsp;Let's see...I went off the blob three times that afternoon, and I fell off every time. And my whole school group&nbsp;was watching. All the guys were cheering and encouraging me, it was SO embarassing. Not cool, but I'm glad I tried.  &nbsp;On Friday, we had a dress-up steak dinner. On Saturday, we had ridge runner go-carts. I had never driven anything but a golf-cart, so I was scared and went really slow. They had to pull me off so the two others could pass me. Only three of us went, because everyone else wanted to pack. And then we went home. I was seriously depressed, it was the most amazingly fun week of my life.  &nbsp;Anyways, besides all that, we had an awesome praise guy named  urlLink Matt Wertz , and a great speaker. I really felt close to God up there, and I'm working to maintain that now. It's just a lot harder at home.  &nbsp;

      The weirdest thing happened two days ago.  So, I broke up with my on-and-off crush/slash boyfriend of about two months in may. I wrote him a note, and he never said another word to me. I did give him, in the note, a chance to save the fragment of a realtionship we had. In his silence, he chose not to. So we parted, I thought, on not the best of terms.  So, on Tuesday, my cell-phone rings(a very rare thing). And it was him. After a short game of Guess-Who, to which I already knew the answer, I just said "Oh my gosh." He laughed, suggesting that maybe I was surprised to hear from him? And I told him I was, and it was nice to hear from him, and we just talked about life for about five minutes. And then he went to bed, since it was 10:30 and he had to work at five. So I was left toally confused.  And I really don't know what to think. Perhaps he wants only to be friends, but that seems a bit strange, as we were not friends before he asked me out. We simply had a mutual crush.  Or maybe, by a slight chance, he is between girlfriends and a bit of interest in me has come up again. And that scares me, because i don't need a reason to like him again. Before he called, I had managed to reduce him to a distant memory and a lesson learned. And now all of these emotions are coming back, and I don't know why. I need a strong, Christian guy with similar interests, so we will have something to talk about. But his call did remind me to pray for him, and so I am.  I guess in the first few weeks of school, I will see what became of us. But unless he calls again, I am left wondering for the summer.

      So, I just realized how much complaining this blog has in it. I really am working now on developing a better attitude. About my job and everything. And after a week in Colorado away from it all, that should be a bit easier.  So, about camp... Where do I start?  First of all, I had a refreshing new view of God's creation. We passed through Kansas, and while some people might have thought it boring, I found it to be gorgeous. I was amazed by the endless view of the sky. On the way back, driving at night, I watched a storm over the praries that must hvae been miles off, but I could see the lightning illuminating the dark sky. The greatness of the sky sort of reminded me of the greatness of God.   When we got into Colorado, the totally flat praries turned into rolling hills. There were still no trees, so you could see all of those beautiful, rolling, green hills. And then, after we got out of Denver, I saw the Rocky Mountains for the first time.  The snow really surprised me. I didn't realize the mountains would have those white caps in late June. And then the hugeness of the mountains overtook me. I courd hardly see the tops of some of the mountains. And then, we began driving up, for miles and miles, towards camp.  I think I'll tell some more about it later. I'm out of time for now.
