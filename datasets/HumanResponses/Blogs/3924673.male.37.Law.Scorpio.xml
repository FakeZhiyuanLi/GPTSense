       Vocabulator  fossick - to search for gold, to rummage or search for possible profit.  I need to take a half day off tomorrow so that I can fossick in Cripple Creek with some friends from out of town.   mysophobia - pathological fear of dirt or contamination.  I am slowly developing mysophobia because some f*cknut here pisses all over the floor in our urinal stall. I think I&nbsp;know who the schmuck is - a Ronald Reagan loving, Star Trek following, socially inept twerp. Can't figure out what to do about it though...&nbsp;  Here is a good link to follow the latest political polls   urlLink http://www.pollingreport.com/wh04gen.htm   BUSH/CHENEY for PRISON 2004

       Middle manager in corporate America...not even in my strangest dream would I end up in such a mediocre environment. How can I sleep at night knowing that I am utterly wasting my talents (assuming I have any) during the prime of my life? How do I make the transition from a meaningless desk job to a challenging and rewarding socially-progressive career? Step one - pass the bar exam. Check. Step two - get a job practicing law, fighting the good fight, defending David against Goliath.&nbsp; Waiting to check this off. Dozens of resumes are drifting around law office desks waiting to land in the lap of the right person. I don't have the balls to open my own practice, so I am trying to find a mentor who is already established and knows the ropes. Unfortunately, Colorado Springs is&nbsp;a tough legal market to crack into, and the drive to Denver would be extremely tedious. Maybe I could get training as a motorcycle mechanic...  Democratic convention time - sure hope Kerry can muster some charisma to woo the masses. If monkeyboy gets reelected, hello Canada. It is unbelievably depressing to know that so many Americans still support such a pathetic leader.

       Thought I had a nice new job lined up with a small law firm on the Western Slope. Got shot down like a lazy-eyed gimp at a sorority ball. Ahh, the joys of pursuing a new line of work. What is my typical response to the job-hunt snubbing? I didn't want that stinking job anyway. Bunch of losers. Well, I know one thing for sure - the longer I stay where I am, the more of a loser I become. So the search has been increasing in intensity of late. &nbsp; Vocabulator: mugwump - a Republican who bolted the party in 1884; one who acts independently, especially in politics. &nbsp; What this country needs now is a whole bunch of new mugwumps. Less than 4 months until we can send bush-boy back to Crawford and his mental superiors, the armadillos.

       My favorite indulgence (when my wife is away) is a nice long ride to Cripple Creek to play a little blackjack. Up Ute Pass, a carving little canyon ripper, through Woodland Park to Divide, around the north side of Pikes Peak to HW67 - one of the best rides in the region - provided you can time it to avoid the Ramling' Express (a geriatric social-security-check transporter) and the despondent drunk losers who are returning from yet another dismal attempt to strike it rich and solve all their problems.  &nbsp; Last night provided such an opportunity, having just had my bike serviced and K in Denver on a conference. The beemer is officially broken in at 6k miles, and it is running better than ever. The high beam and driving lights sliced through the darkness as I&nbsp;pushed the bike through an endless series of S turns. The heated handgrips felt like they were going to melt the leather gloves, and the hypnotic hum of the powerful two-stoke engine sent my mind into a state of one with the machine. &nbsp; Parked the bike and strolled into Womacks casino, pulled up to a table and pissed $20 away in about 4 minutes. OK, that was fun. On to the Gold Rush, where the tables were a little bit more lively. There's a $5 limit in Cripple Creek, so the chances of hitting it big are slim; but I'm a rinky-dink gambler so I'm not complaining. Had a sassy dealer who was realy dissing out some shit to the players, but she kept busting and my stack kept growing. Pretty soon it was closing in on midnight, and I was just about&nbsp;ready to hit the road. Dealer set me up with a 6 and and a 4 while she was showing 3, so I doubled down and landed a face card, easy win. Next hand I was sitting on 11, dealer on 8, doubled down again for soft 21, another easy win. Next hand I had a 7 and a 2, dealer had 8, what the hell, it's been working, double down again, drew a 3 for a grand total of 12. Well, the dealer helped me out with another bust and I snuck away from the table&nbsp;up a cool $100.  &nbsp; Had a nice open stretch of road on the way home and took the bike into tripple digits for the first time. A little buffetting, lot's of wind noise, things zipping by a little too fast for my comfort, so I eased it back down to 70 and put it into cruiser mode. Now I'm back at work, wondering what I will do tonight. Maybe a nice&nbsp;little ride out to Cripple Creek? &nbsp; Vocabulator Time: Snickersnee &nbsp; a swordlike knife; the act of fighting with knives. &nbsp; Until next time, Bush still sucks.

       To balance the scales after blowing a wad of cash on a motorcycle, I attended an artsy-fartsy aerial dance production from an Italian troupe. It was actually entertaining, with maidens suspended from big helium ballons and twirling angels inside giant glowing gerbal excercise balls. Here's a write up.  "In this performance 'Light Beings' are the ones that lead us through the world of the Spirit, a world where desperately man wishes to be, the place he mostly misses, that in this performance talks to us using the flying language. Spheres' harmony on earth and in the sky, almost immaterial purity of figures dancing suspended on invisible threads, musical breath of light, upright walks that challenge gravity's law, all those are angels' prerogatives, and they appear according to their different categories: archangels, cherubs, seraphs, scanning the sight in three parts.   urlLink Festi  is the acknowledged international master of live public art, developed to celebrate the magnificence of human creativity on the grandest of scales. His Studio Festi theatre company has performed in more than 200 cities worldwide. Studio Festi will come to the U.S. for the first time in 20 years, and will present the first two U.S. performances for "Of Angels and Light."  The show will transform The Broadmoor Resort's grounds into a celestial playground of music and light, where angels descend to earth suspended from huge, helium-filled spheres of light floating high above the crowd, performers spin and dance above the heads of the audience, and transparent spheres roll through the crowd with performers inside.  This was the polar opposite, on the cultural spectrum, from the type of events that I normally gravitate towards, such as the awe-inspiring  urlLink Tenacious D  concert, the mind-blowing  urlLink Reggae on the Rocks  festival that I will be grooving on next month, or the  urlLink Telluride Bluegrass Festival  that we sampled last month.   The moral of this story - when the wife is happy, I'm happy. Oh yeah, and President Bush is a  urlLink Jackass .

       Last night I saw an extremely intoxicated black man stumbling down the street with a bottle in one hand and what appeared to be a handgun in the other. I debated calling the police to get him checked out, but thought there was a chance he was just an ordinary bum holding something innocuous. I didn't want the cops to show up and riddle him with bullets based on my faulty intelligence.   Speaking of faulty intelligence, my ability to rationally discuss politics is on the verge of disintegrating. My disgust with the current administration, and those who steadfastly defend it in the face of powerful evidence of corruption and greed, is slowly impinging on my ability to ignore my responsibility to help create a more just society, while simultaneously driving me deeper into a cave of denial and self-preservational hedonism. My current role model for dishing up the dirt on monkey-boy and his cronies is Greg Palast, probably the best investigative journalist of our time.  urlLink The Scoop   If I were the president, I'd sponsor a bill creating mandatory siestas for all workers. Come 2:00, I'm in dire need of recharging, and a quick 15 minute snooze can revitalize my brain for the demanding tasks of the afternoon (web-surfing, snack-hunting, daydreaming, etc). Fortunately, I have an office with a solid desk, and I can crawl into my personal anti-work bunker for some down time. I recommend an inflatable pillow and a slanting footrest, and keep an extra sweater or coat around to serve as a cozy blanket. To minimize the risk of discovery (the open door managerial policy has certain drawbacks) I use my chair as a shield in an attempt to keep my nap-habit clandestine.  I want to start a tradition - the Vocabulator, a lesson in advanced expression. Today's word:   Callipygian - having beautifully proportioned buttocks.  Try to work that into a conversation.

       I have nothing interesting to say, I'm just another corporate stooge, ticking away the moments that make up a dull day. Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. Even when I plagarize I'm boring. To improve the illusion of living the rebel's life, I just bought a big ass motorcycle and I'm looking for a leather jacket with a reflective dominatrix on the bag. My thrill-seeking hobbies include home improvement, reading, watching movies on my HDTV, and telling the neighborhood kids to get off my lawn.   My five year aniverary with LexisNexis is rolling around, and with it a fierce urge to withdraw my 401k and head to Vegas for some high stakes blackjack. I've sent instructions to a hit man to take me out if I'm still here five years from now.  Do yourselves a favor and don't bookmark this site (how in the f**k did you find it in the first place?)

       First off, I must say that my new favorite olympic sport is women's beach volleyball. Dayum. Second, I must say that my local NBC affiliate sucks because they are jerking around instead of broadcasting in high definition. Yes, these two topics are directly related.  This blog sucks because I am boring.
