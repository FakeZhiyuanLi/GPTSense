      I think that I'm becoming way too comfortable with this blogging thing.  Writing has always been a passion of mine, more than that; a necessity.  I find myself allowing words and feeling to come tumbling out of me, crashing over each other and getting all mixed up, making no sense at all but bring relief from the internal pressure.  Yeah, it's true.  Ben and I broke up.  No, I don't want to talk about it.  It's too painful.  I can't really bring my self to tell people.  Somehow it seems that if I talk about it it makes it more real.  I know in my head that it was the right thing to do.  It was time for me to get out of the way and let God work.  It doesn't mean that I like it.  I don't want the questions.  Why and when is really nobody's business.  What gets me is that people want to know if it's permanent or if we're going to get back together.  How would I know?  Obviously if I could see the future I would have known that we would break up at this point and I would have headed it off.  Right now, in this moment, I'm angry.  I'm angry because it's easier than being hurt.  I'm angry because I find myself completely alone to deal with this.  I know that there are people who would say that I can always count on them, but so many of them are the same people who want to drift in and out of relationships, friendships, of convenience.  That's okay, but it doesn't really make me want to share my deepest wounds with them.  If I can't count on them in the day to day stuff, why would I in a time of need.    I really don't want to talk to my parents about it.  Actually, I'm not going to talk to my parents about it.  I know that they're not excited for me to have a boyfriend, not that they're against it-just indifferent.  I feel as though the didn't want to participate when Ben and I were together, and I don't want them to be a part of it now that it's over.  I am DREADING my birthday.  I wish that I could just go to sleep and skip that day.  I don't want to answer the, "how come Ben isn't here?" question from multiple relatives.  How do you say that you still love someone but you're not together anymore?  "Don't think ahead" I keep telling myself; only one day at a time.  If you get ahead you will see this endless expanse and give up.  One day at a time.    I'm angry at myself for being such a baby.  I know that me breaking up with my boyfriend is not some world changing event.  One day this will be only a distant memory.  I won't even remember that I wrote this.  I feel as though I should be stronger.  That it shouldn't make me so sad.  I think of Paul imprisoned, and singing praises.  He knew what real LIFE was all about.  And so I say,  Dear Jesus, here I am in all of my weaknesses and selfishness.  I confess that I have been hurt, and I have tried to hide that and have turned it into anger instead.  I have taken my eyes off of You...You know what is best, and I have placed them on myself and my own hurt.  Help me to let go.  Help my unbelief.

           That's right; this morning I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  I dreamt last night...well anyway, it wasn't real.  And I woke up lonely and still sleepy.  I did my devotions for a long time, I'm in Luke and I read about Christ's crucifiction today.  Do you know what struck me?  Those people, yelling "crucify Him!", they were the same people that He healed and who sat at His feet...and if I were there I would have been one of them.  I've always read that in the past and thought, "how could they know Him and do that?".  Yet my own life reflects the same kind of behavior.  I prayed for too long, and then was rushing around grabbing clothes and eating breakfast at the same time.  I brushed my teeth at work.  I hate rushed mornings.  It wasn't a bad day honestly.  There were hardly any kids and I started planning the Independance Day party for Thursday.    When it came time for my break I plopped down on the couch and started to journal, read and pray.  I started to pray for Ben, and before I could even get started I felt this sneaky snake in my heart.  Disappointment and meanness was growing there.  Well, it had to come out.  I didn't even know what it was from.  I found out.  Do you know what my deepest desire and need is?  To be loved.  All of my life I've been a "best friend" person.  I always have a best friend.  I want one person to share every detail of my life with, to tell my secrets to, and to be affectionate with.  I want to take care of them and spend every waking moment with them.  Today I came face to face with this.  Mandi has been my best friend since I was 11, almost 12 years.  Growing older we have drifted apart.  She is still my best friend, but not the way I want and need a best friend.  Benjamin is my other best friend, and due to circumstances he isn't here to take care of me either.  And there you have it folks.  My whole life I've been secure in God + best friend.  Now I feel alone and insecure.  I'm such an introvert and have all of these secret thoughts and dreams; my own secrets.  I want to share them with someone.  The real issue is that I was/am kind of angry at God.  I do feel forlorn.  I say that I trust Him, but I see in my heart that for all of my intentions I really don't.  Somehow, deep inside of me without my knowing I have taking back my heart.  Resentful that things are not going that way, that I don't have somebody to count on.  One more step.  Ever changing.  Learning and growing.  Sometimes walking through the desert is lonely and painful, but it's good.

      I'm only going to start at today.  Well, maybe last night.  I was sitting on the couch watching a movie with my roommate when the thought "I hate myself" popped into my head.  I've been very sad lately, personal trouble you understand.  This thought though, it was not mine.  It was directly from the Father of Lies.  He's been starting in on me again lately.  Thoughts that I'm not attractive, that I'm not "worth anything" that nobody really loves me....  Last night I quickly rejected this thought; said, "no I don't, I don't hate myself".  I remembered that we are to love others as we love ourselves.  But first, you have to love yourself as God loves you.  Not with pride or arrogance, but with humility understanding that you are valuable and worth something.  So I told myself all of this and dismissed the thoughts; but still the tears came.  Coursing down my cheeks and plopping on the pillow.       Presently I am reading the book, The Power of a Praying Wife by Stormie OMartian.  No, I'm not married; but I know that I can "stand in the gap" for Ben and change the course of his life if I will sacrifice a little bit of my time and lay my heart before the Lord.  It is a painful process.  Letting go of what I want for Ben, of my hopes and desires, and praying for God's best for him.  Each day I read a new chapter and pray for that area in his life.  Last night as I crept into bed I picked up the book and read the chapter titled, "His Mind".  It was on these very things, these intrusive thoughts, these lies.  It was what I needed to hear and what I knew he needed prayer for.  These are the verses from that chapter: 2 Corinthians 10:3-5 Romans 8:6 Romans 7:23 Romans 7:25 Mark 12:30 Such powerful weapons on fighting the prince of darkness.         This morning I awoke at 7:45 in perfect stillness.  It was the first night in a long time that I had not awoken in the night from a great pain.  I made the LONG reach from the bed to the floor and picked up the book.  This morning it was on "His Fears".  Why do the chapters always coincide with my heart?  With that I am fearing for him?   "Perfect Love casteth out fear..." (1 John 4:18) was the verse wrapped it's way around my heart.  I need that perfect love right now.  Sometimes I feel unloveable.  I read the chapter, praying for Benjamin and mulling over the verses.  Psalm 34:7 The angel of the Lord encamps al around those who fear Him, and delivers them.  Psalm 34:4 I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and delivered me from all of my fears.  Psalm 23:4 Isaiah 41:10 Psalm 27:1  I didn't want to go to church.  I am AFRAID.  I really am a chicken.  I'm not clucking, I mean, kidding.  I have no clue how people get the idea that I'm brave.  If they only knew how I force myself to do things that I'm terrified of....  But I know that it is good and right to go to church, and that it's not going to get any better unless I stick with it and make friends.  I was ready early.  Just sitting on the loveseat, thinking.  Fear and temptation almost overwhelmed me at that minute.  Something screaming, "take what you can get".  I wanted to turn back, to reach out a desprate grasping hand for human love instead of waiting in faith on my God.  My mind became clouded and I felt almost sick.  I just started saying verses out loud. "No temptation has seized you except what is common to man..."  I took a deep breath and left for church.  I know that it sounds silly to say that I was so scared of going to church that I was shaking.  But I was.  Literally.  I just wanted someone to say hi to me, or "nice to see you here today".  On the cover of the bulletin was the verse, I Cor. 10:13  I smiled.  God sure is a funny guy.  The message today was on Matthew 4:1-11; temptation in our lives.  I'm not kidding when I say that the guy was talking directly to me.  Oh-to remember that Jesus was tempted in all things, that He understands my heart.  He sees my struggle and my pain and is helping me through it.  Listen to these verses that he brought up!  For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.  Hebrews 2:18  For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin. Hebrews 4:15       Several days ago I felt something moving me to read "Hinds Feet on High Places" again.  So I picked it up.  Many of the same verses and surfaced and my scripture reading, prayer reading, church and this book and parallel.  It's not a coincidence.  God has compassion on His people in their weaknesses.  He sees my heart, He knows where I am broken.  But He also sees how I can be healed and made whole.  It is time for me to willingly take sorrow and suffering by the hand.  To cast aside my fears and the "what ifs" of the future.  To stop focusing on my pain and the here and now, and to resolutely start climbing the heights.  I know that the enemy is coming out in force now.  He is my only hope.  I want so badly to be changed.  There is so much wickedness in my heart.  So many insecurities that are growing into deep rooted sin that I refuse to give up.  And so my journey continues.  A small chicken who will be given the heart of a lion...

      People will say to you, "It will get better".  The fact of the matter is that it may not.  Why do they say it?  Because they don't know what else to say?  Because they can't fix it?  It always seems to be one thing after another, but I'm thankful that it comes in that order instead of all at once.       I'm at my parents house for the weekend.  I'm packing things up and they're moving slowly.  I'm sorting through things, deciding what should be kept out, what is still valuable but should be packed away for later, and what needs to be thrown out.  It seems that I'm doing that in my head and heart at the same time.

      This site is dangerous.  It's like the fastest journaling ever.  I sit here in my dark and quiet house, alone with the eerie glow of the computer.  No one is around.  No one can hear me.  There is only the cadance of the keys being struck.  In the stillness it feels personal.  It feels secret.  Although I am sure that no one reads this nor cares about my "secrets", yet what if they do?  I must remember to be more careful of what I share.        Do you ever feel as though you are being taken apart?  Peeled back layer by layer?  The pain only intensifies.  Those who say that time heals all things never really experienced anything that they needed to be healed of.  This week has been long and very simple.  Is it that so many small things have gone wrong, or is it that I'm just noticing them?      On my way home from work yesterday my car wouldn't accelerate very well.  Maybe needs some trans fluid?  bingo.  So I added it.  Drove like a dream on the way to work.  Even the noise stopped.  Until the drive home.  It won't seem to stay in gear, it keeps slipping, acting like it's in neutral.  I couldn't do over 35 and had to keep it in second.  Not looking so good, a bad trans you say.  oh yes, a bad trans I answer.  It doesn't put immediate pressure on me until Monday, but you know what I hate?  I hate having to call my dad and deliever more bad news.  Dad, my computer doesn't work.  Dad, I can't pay my bill.  Dad, my car doesn't work.  I feel like a burden and an energy sucker.  Mostly because I can't do anything about it myself.  So I'm praying over my car.  Praying that God will just keep it working long enough for the other to be done.  Not to many things at one time eh?      Today was hair cut day.  Do you know why I HATE hair cut day?  I always go in with these expectations that I'm going to come out looking (blank).  Fill it in.  Prettier.  Older.  More attractive.  Better.  Whatever word you can think of that is positive, I've thought that this would do it for me.  "Now if only I could get my hair cut...."  I came out today and looked in the mirror.  Silly.  Ugly.  Nerdy.  Nope, it doesn't distract from the zits on my face of my fat legs.  If anything, it just ties it all together.  "cute" .  I'm always told that I'm cute.  What is cute exactly?  I think that it means that I'm not pretty or beautiful, but not ugly either.  That my features all go together in their own weird way.  Like the hair cut.  I've reached the level of "cute".  Why do I never make the next one?  Maybe I'm too cute for it.

      Yesterday I started to cry.  I haven't really been able to stop.  My heart is so sad.  I crawled into bed with party, prince and agape to snuggle and think.  I decided that it's okay to be sad, but I don't want to be a part of self-pity.  Because you know what?  Pity parties only have room for one, and it becomes lonlier and lonlier.  It's okay for me to greive and mourn, and to be thankful for my God's faithfulness at the same time.  I just started thinking of things to be thankful for and saying them out loud.        Today was an interesting day.  I didn't have to go into work until 11 so I was able to get a lot of stuff done.  Hair cut apt, academic advising apt, make a school payment, go running (wearing my SUPER cool knee brace) and do my devotions.  I went into work calm and peaceful.  Focused on Truth.  Mason threw up while he was sleeping.  Poor little guy.  Another teacher announced it and just stood there watching(?) while I dashed over to pick him up.  He wasn't even awake yet and literally had his face in it.  I moved him over to the counter to try to clean him up and he puked again, everywhere.  On my arm and shorts, on himself, the counter the floor.  Breakfast sausage and pb&j....  I felt so bad for him throwing up like that and bawling his eyes out that I didn't even mind the barf.  After I took his clothes off I just stood and held him.  Yes, I reeked like puke forever.  You know what it makes me think of?  It makes me think of God.  I think that that's how He sees us.  Covered in filth and waste and completely undesirable as we are He has compassion upon us and longs to help us and clean us up.  Wouldn't it have been weird if that little toddler would have tried to cover up his puke so that no one would know?  What if he denied that it was there?  What if he just looked at it and thought that it wasn't all that bad, that he didn't mind sleeping in it?  Makes me think that I shouldn't do that myself.      Last night I had the craziest dream.  I was at Dunning, running around in the basement and being chased by some boys.  Frantically trying to make it to the upper floor before they caught up with me.  When I reached the stairs things changed.  One of the boys was injured and I realized that he was my son from my boyfriend that I was estranged from (who was standing at the top of the stairs).  I walked up the stairs and all of my desires changed.  I wanted to be a unit with this family.  The only way to be able to do that was to endure pain.  For some reason I had to be skinned alive.  It was so painful, even in my dream.  I remember screaming, but I was willingly enduring the pain in order to get what my heart really longed for. I walked around without skin, this bloody tender mass of muscle and tissue, weeping and begging people to have mercy upon me and be gentle with me.  But soon they would give me my new skin.  It would be better than the old.  And then everything would be right.  What does it mean?  Maybe it's just weird.

      I can't stop crying.  I started laughing this past weekend and somehow everything cracked and I started crying too.  I'm just so sad all the time.  I can't believe that I'm back here again.

      My best-friend, Mandi, just took me on a wonderful trip to Geneva, IN.  Not much there except Gene Stratton-Porter's house!  It was wonderful and absolutely thrilling to me.  We also wiggled our way into a real amish home!!!  It was so good to spend time with her and stay at a fabulous bed and breakfast...and yet I'm angry.  I drove down 69 to get there.  It brought up so many memories.  I struggled the entire time.  On the way home we stopped in Ft. Wayne for lunch.  Went to Puccini's.  I sat in the exact same spot.  My chin quivered again.  We even ordered the same pizza.  I don't think that I tasted it.  I was starring at the ring on my finger instead.  I got home and cleaned up the apartment, unpacked and took a nap.  Any kind of escape is good.  Except that my dreams have been awful lately.  Totally weird and crazy things.  Ben was in this one.  I think that I kissed his cheek.  I was so angry with everyone and no one.  I didn't care.  I just wanted it all to be over.  When I woke up the feeling didn't diminish.  I stomped around for a few minutes and finally sat down to tell God how I feel.  So angry, really just disappointed and hurt.  I want it to be fixed but there's nothing that I can do.  In fact, I played the game that messed it all up.  Anger is just a cover for hurt or an unwillingness to discover our real feelings.  It's so much easier to feel angry than anything else.  1 Corinthians 4(or maybe 5?)-I'm not even to judge myself.

      ...and Miracles Will Grow.  At least, I hope that they will.  Do you realize that if you want to plant your dreams, you have to dig a hole and BURY them?  It is a terrifying thing, to place your hearts desire in a dark hole and cover it with the dirt.  I keep wanting to run back and dig it up, just to see how much it has grown.  But it's too soon.  I would end up killing it.  I think about it all the time, praying over these seeds in my life.  Hoping that I will not be disappointed in the end. But if I don't do it, then I will always hold the seeds in my hand and wonder what could have been, how much more beautiful would they have been.  And I would become angry and bitter that I had only the seeds and no fruit nor life to show for it.  So I buried them instead.    I've been working at the new house like crazy.  Cleaning cleaning cleaning.  Bounder goes with me and follows me from one room to the other.  She is such a sweet girl and very affectionate.  A family of gophers live in the back yard there.  They have chewed through the step on the deck to make their hole.  Although they are very cute they have to die.  Josh began yesterday.  He got out his bow and waited just around the corner of the window with it notched and ready.  I watched out the window and gave him the signal.  He pulled back and...missed (his bow doesn't have sights on it right now-he wasn't planning on using it).  But just barely.  Ruined his arrow.  His friend Dan was there too.  Although he had to leave the room because there is not a stealthy bone in his body.  He giggles and bounces around.  The boys play was that Josh would shoot it and then Dan would run out and hack it with the machete!  I told Josh to go into the Sun Room, I watched out the window and Dan blinded it with a spot light.  Josh got it right in the eye. It wormed it's way back down the hole, leaving a big pool of blood.  "Machete Dan" said, "oh Josh-I feel kinda bad for it".  You know, I understand that things need to die sometimes, and that I shouldn't be over sensitive about it.  I've killed animals....  But something in me finds it distasteful.  There is no pleasure in watching something suffer.  People or animals.

      I feel as though I sit in a stillness of time.  For so long I have been sad and lonely.  The isolation was setting in.  Constant static in my brain.  I felt as though I wanted and longed to be close to people and have meaningful relationships but had almost forgotten how.  It is as if I have become lazy in the pursuit of this very thing.  Moping about was not helping.  So I'm learning instead.  Oh, I still cry myself to sleep at night, but it's different.  I am not pushing so hard for this stage of life to be over, but pushing myself to find contentment and peace.  Suffering is a good thing.  These past several weeks have made me that much more sensitive to others' pain.  Even though I may not agree with their thinking, I can walk in their shoes and feel for them.  Each day is a struggle.  At moments I despise myself.  If only you could see my heart, perhaps you would not love me then.  Today I thought, "I believe that God only allows us to see our sin to a minimal depth; if we could grasp how wretched we are all in an instant we would despair.  Our discouragement would overwhelm us and we would turn our backs on God."  As it is, I am going to a new level.  I am not a "good person".  There is no such thing as one.  I am prideful and wicked, full of judgement and wrath.  Yet I am precious a dearly loved.  I will never be a "better Christian" or more dearly loved than I am at this very moment.  Daily God is giving me chances to change my thinking and choose His way.  What an internal struggle for me, I am so hard hearted.  Every time I choose Him though, that burden is lifted and I find that elusive freedom.  Isn't that what we all want?  Freedom from ourselves?

      I have re-joined the world of "I hate boys!"  Lately my heart has been so weighed down and achey.  I went to the book store today to fill out my application for graduation.  As you can imagine this can be a frustrating process.  As I was sitting there I noticed a gentlemen checking me out.  A slightly uncomfortable feeling, you understand.  I did as much as I could on the application and then began to wander the store.  I fingered some journals for awhile, picking out the one that I could purchase if I had the money.  I found a "home library kit" in the same department, and wished that I could buy it.  Cat Woman postcards, books on sale, a shrek chess game all grabbed my attention.  I found myself in the Christian section abstractly purusing the titles.  "Every Man's Battle" caught my attention so I picked it up.  *sigh* I was back on the same topic.  I read the first story, about a married man checking out a really hot chic while driving.  I would have purchased it but again, I lack the funds.  I shook my head and walked out.    I am so weary of it all.  I don't understand.  I comprehend that guys are looking for "their" perfect woman.  But what about when they find her?  Why am I checked out by married men or guys with girlfriends?  Why are they not content with what they have?  Woman shopping is just fine for guys who are looking to purchase, but afterwards why are they still always shopping?  Wanting the newer or better version?  I don't get it.  I'm sad and hurt.  I'm angry and tired.    When I arrived back at the apartment there was a group of guys walking by.  I looked up just in time to catch their eyes, and to see them crane their neck, practically walking backward, as they passed.  *sigh* it never ends.

      I'm just going to clost my eyes and start writing.  All of my thougs flowing out of me.  Circles, everything goes in circles.  Let me of of this merry go round of myself.  We all think that we're right.  Locked away in our own private minds, of course it is reasonable.  I'm not saying that it isn't....only, what if?  I was somehow born with my dad's bad temper.  I never thought of being emotional, intense, passionate and BAD before.  But that was before.  I saw a child throw a fit at work yesterday.  He had hurt another student, but when he saw his mom he ran screaming for her.  She did something that most parents wouldn't do.  She wouldn't let him touch her.  She told him to sit, to finish his time-out, and to stop crying before he got up.  My parents used to do that to me.  "stop crying".  I thought that they were so mean.  Now I realize that one of the biggest lessons that a parent must teach is emotional control.  Not allowing emotions to rule us and make decisions for us is key.  Emotions are to be a seasoning to life.  Something to make it more real, for us to experience those around us and to form a bond; they drive us back to God.  But they must be controlled, so that they don't control us.  Many adults have not learned this lesson.  It makes it harder to love them over time.  They love intensely but they also hate the same way.  But hate will come to all those to cross their line, and everyone will eventually.          I have the makings of one of these people.  My first thoughts are feelings.  Oh-I don't fly off the handle and let everyone know what I REALLY think;  but I could leak a few zingers if I wanted to.  I have such highs and lows, sometimes in the same day.  This morning I had an amazing time of communion with God, but alas, I have experienced emotions during the day and now I FEEL differently.  Silly, isn't it?  God has not moved, but my heart has.  I just sat down on the couch to suck my thumb for awhile and cry it all out.  Confession came instead.  Ahhh Father.  Do you ever tire of me?  I tire of myself.  I get so confused sometimes.  I can be so strong willed and rebellious, and then so weary and submissive.  I have gone through this day hoarding my feelings to myself and now I am all wrapped up in them.  They're blue and wrapped around me like a big rubber-band ball.  The more that I struggle the more that I am encased by them.  I'm sorry Father.  Sorry for being resentful and jealous, sorry for being sneaky and rebellious-if only in my mind.  I am just going to sit here until you unwind me.  Remind me to come to you FIRST.  That you know the most appropriate and healthy emotion for the circumstance.  Help me not to go overboard as I so often do.  Help me to not close up and feel nothing at all.  I know that you gave me my feelings.  You made me the type of person that I am.  Show me where the balance lies, and please don't allow me to run out ahead of you in this area.

      You think that you are looking for me within yourself.  You are mistaken.  You are searching for contentment and for happiness, and those are found in God alone.  Life is scary when it is monotonous and dull.  Lonliness creeps in with the shadows when you are not on watch.  So you must always stand on guard.  "Be on the alert, your enemy prowls around like a roaring lion".  "Draw near to God and He will draw near to you, resist the devil and he will FLEE from you!"  Come to the end of yourself quickly, and most importantly: DON'T LISTEN TO THE LIES ECHOING IN YOUR HEAD!!!   I am an emotional person.  One of my biggest mistakes is trying to think myself free of my own emotions, as if my thoughts are any less muddled than my feelings.  So I cry out to God, to direct my emotions, and to help me control myself.  Have faith.  I am in so much need of it.
