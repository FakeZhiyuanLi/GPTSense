      Yeah, so I wanted to get a job since mid-July, but my Dad finds some weird ideal where I need to be in something for school from my freshman year to my junior year. I don't get it, and I actually didn't have a headache before he told me and the day was going pretty good, but he just comes out and says dumbass bullshit and makes me try to find reasoning behind it, and I begin to get a headache and it gets the point where I don't want to think anymore. Man, my dad is fucking loser, and he probably wishes I would just start running or something, that's why he's doing this. I don't think my dad really understands me at all, and he thinks I do drugs and am irresponsible and immature for some reason. Well, that's all, I'm done.

      Today, I went school shopping and got everything I needed for all my classes. Speaking of School, I think I'll post my cool schedule for this year. I might change it, depending if I become the Cross Country Manager, but that's only if I don't get a job, because I'll be bored after school everyday. So here it is: 1st Period: CISCO Networking I - CISCO Networking II 2nd Period: CISCO Networking I - CISCO Networking II 3rd Period: Chemistry I - Regulars 4th Period: Physical Education (1st sem.) Biology I (2nd sem.) 5th Period: U.S. History - Regulars 6th Period: Algebra II - Regulars 7th Period: English III - Regulars  Yeah, I know, I don't do a whole lot in school, I don't care for AP and Honors, because I don't really need it for what I want, I can get into small colleges and univerities for computers, so it's cool. Even though, if I work for CISCO Networking, then I won't even need a college education, all I need is to be CCNA certified. Hah, my dad had always told me I had no future without college, guess CISCO Networking proves him wrong. It's hard, though, but it's not like I'm retarded, so I think I can manage, besides working for CISCO has nice pay. Not much has happened today, though, I haven't even played a game, yet. Maybe, I will do so soon, oh well. That's all.

      So, today I rebegan my ride on Warcraft III. This is my third session of playing and I fixed CS, so I can play that now. You know, lately things have been coming hard, if it's not rebuilding relationships or explaining why I decided to change back to being 'fangay'. Chris said something about me being owned and I have enough nerve as David as coming back. What's that supposed to mean anyway. I got owned, seriously, I matured, fuck man. I'm really get annoyed with Chris, it's like, "you're not my friend, time to turn gay-mode on. " I haven't heard an intellgent thing out of him since we stopped being friends. It is really pathetic. Anyway, Warcraft III was pretty fun, and I'm thinking about buying FFXI if I get the money to waste time for WoW. Well, that's all for now. 2 post in one awake session, man I am a loser.

      I'm sick and tired of morons being friends with me, it's not even fun. I hate hearing them speak out their thoughts, they make no sense, and if they do, they are completely retarded. For example, today, Dolomite and I had been friends for awhile, but for some reason he turns gay-mode on whenever Targus is logged in, and I just don't see why he does that. I guess I'm just too mature to be friends with someone like him. Whatever, fuck morons, no point in being friends with them.

      After like a week of not playing Counter-Strike, I normally have like 95-99 FPS as long as it's not on a map like Aztec or Chateau. After, quitting my clan due to my hard as fuck schedule and the fact I wasn't finding scrimming too fun anymore. I finally played after not playing for a whole week. Then I joined some random pub server right after I got home yesterday at about 4:30 PM, and at first my FPS seemed fine, going at 80-99, but nothing horrible. Then, I join a team and spawn and my FPS starts going down to 10 and back to 99 and so forth, and it just wouldn't stop. I'm guessing it was either my drivers had become faulty, or the fact I hadn't restarted in a week or the downloads I had going. I played earlier after restarting and i had 50-99 on de_dust2, so maybe it was my drivers, guess I'll find out.

      So, this is my blog for now, I'm mainly doing this because, I'm bored as fuck and it just came to my mind to make one. I'll post when I want, I'm not sure how often that will be, or what it will even be about, whatever is at mind and I feel like sharing. This might be cool, then again it might last as long as my Xanga had. I may change the template sooner or later, I don't know, whatever I feel like doing.
