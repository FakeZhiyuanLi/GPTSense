      Last night Rich and I went to see 'Fiddler on the Roof' starring Alfred Molina. (Aunt Margaret- we used your gift certificate from Christmas to get the tickets- so thanks!!!) It was a wonderful production. The performers were all so talented. It was a really touching play, and such a treat for us. Tomorrow we head up to Connecticut to party it up with Katie and Joe.

      Welcome to the official Virginia Donohoe Fan Club site. Thanks so much to all of you who joined, I assure you your membership fee will be used wisely, except for the occasional botox treatment or weekend at the slot machines in Atlantic City! He He!  Things are going very well in NYC. I had my first interview with a temp agency today, it went well. I have another interview tomorrow, and hopefully I'll be working by Tuesday! For Memorial Day weekend my boyfriend Rich and I are going to New Haven to stay with Katie and Joe. I can't wait! Tomorrow night we're going to see Fiddler On The Roof on Broadway, I'm terribly excited!

      I had a hard day today. I temped at ICM (a really huge celebrity management company) I was running the switchboard which was much much harder than I thought it could be. LOTS of calls from all over the world. The work wasn't so bad, it's just that I'm having a hard time with New York  attitude . Almost everyone I dealt with was extremely confrontational, and in my opinion, kinda  mean . I know I'll get used to it, but for now I feel like a Minnesota-nice wuss.

       I'm at temp job today in a Advertising and PR firm on Madison ave. My temp agent told me to dress,"Uber-corperate," so I'm in blouse and skirt, heels and pearls; It's like I get to play  executive dress up  all day long!                           Not much is new in NYC. I'm getting much more comfortable with the trains, and having an easier time finding my way around in general. I'm getting used to the temp grind, although the uncertainty of employment from day to day can get just a wee bit stressful.                                                          Rich had some great news last week. He got on an improv team at a second city-type theatre called Chicago City Limits, it's a pretty big deal. He gets to tour all over the country, a few weekends a month, improvising sketches and songs. He also performs locally on wednesday nights. He's doing really well and it's very exciting.    This is  Summer Restaurant Week  in NYC.Throughout the year fabulous restaurants fix their prices low, so starving artist types like me can see how the other half eats. On Thursday Rich and I are going to have dinner at Judson Grill, which will hopefully be very very fabulous...I can't wait.

      I'm generally a slacker when it comes to fitness, I enjoy working out, but lack the drive. As my Showcase (my big audition for NY agents and casting directors) nears I'm feeling the need to get in shape. And although my friend Elizabeth and I are taking yoga classes, I was thinking I might need something a bit more hardcore.  Rich shares my crappy attutide about fitness, he hates the gym but also wants to get cut- so he found a solution online. It's called Platoon Fitness, an outdoor "bootcamp" style daily workout. It's directed at  unmotivated types like me; if you don't show up they call you, find you, or make the rest of the group do push ups. And the kicker is that they meet in Central Park at 5:30 IN THE MORNING!!! This Morning Rich and I gave it a whirl.  We got up at 4:30 and, with the late night train schedule still in effect, barely made it in time. We got to the park where we found a bunch of pretty ripped people waiting for us, and we began to run. The instructor was nice, but very firm, we never stopped moving.  We ran, and climbed, did push ups, sit ups, and relays. We did drills up and down hills with push ups ( on the concrete) in between. It was HARD. I think I died.  But Rich and I both felt pretty great afterward.  I'm glad I did it, it was a wonderful workout and the park was absolutely beautiful in the morning...but I just don't think I'm a 4:30am, sweating in the dirt, kinda girl. I think I'll stick with yoga, clean, soft, tinkly music, theraputic breathing yoga...ohmmmmm!

      Yesterday I made it official, I had my first professional audition  in New York. I woke up at seven and took the train to the Actors Equity building on 26th Street(right off Times Square). There, I found about 150 struggling actors all waiting in line.  This audition was an open call for a festival of new plays to be produced here in New York. These open calls are reqired by Equity (the actors union) to allow actors who don't have agents the opportunity to audition. I had expected to see a line of actors who looked just like me, young and green. I found just the opposite. They all were a little old and, well, weathered. We all waited for about an hour until a monitor took us inside and we all were given time slots to audition.  I came back at 2pm, all dressed up and very excited. The monitor stuck about twenty of us in a small hallway to wait for our chance to audition. I looked around and I admit, I got a little cocky. I thought' "Hey I'm one of the only normal looking people in here and I have a masters, I'm gonna knock em dead!" My turn came and I eagerly walked into the studio, introduced myself, and started my monologue. I thought it went really well. When I finshed I looked up at the auditioners and it was as if they had forgotten I was even in the room, they both muttered a little, "ah, thank you virginia." And I walked out of the door, humbled. I do think the experience was educational. I now know how these things work, where to go and what to expect. With open calls it's sort of hit or miss, sometimes they are just a formality and sometimes they actually cast from them. I figure, for now ( until I get an agent- fingers crossed), it's a great opportunity for me to be an actor on any given day. I got to act yesterday, and no matter the outcome, that feels great!

      Last night Rich and I were dropping off out laundry on our way to dinner. As we left the laundramat and crossed the street I heard tires screeching, looked back, and saw a woman bouncing over a cab and landing on the street. Before I really knew what was happenning I saw Rich run head on into traffic to the woman, he ripped off his shirt at put it under her bleeding head as he stopped the cabby from moving her, and tried to get her to speak. He yelled back to me "cell phone-911." I fumbled to get my phone out and dial. My voice was shaking, I told the woman on the line we were at the corner of E.16th and 3rd ave, that a woman had been hit by a taxi, and that I didn't know whether she was conscious or not. By this time a small crowd was forming, the whole intersection had stopped, and an emergency room Dr. had showed up. He was talking to the woman, who was still on the ground bleeding but was responding to his questions. Within minutes 3 ambulences showed up, and she was taken to the hospital. Rich stayed and explained what he saw to the cops, he left his bloody shirt on in the street, and came over to me to ask if I was okay. I was amazed, he was so brave, not a thought for himslef, he just ran to help this woman instinctually.  We went to dinner and decided that we need to put emergency contact info in our wallets,"Just in case." It was a pretty big wake-up call, this is a huge city and it would be terrifying if something like that happened and we were all alone.

      So in all the excitement of my first day on the job I forgot to report on the fantastic time Rich and I had visiting Katie and Joe. Saturday Joe gave us his  mini-tour of Yale,(he knows all kinds trivia) and we went out for pizza and beers at Bar. Sunday we went to the beach and ate nothing but fried seafood, mmmmm. Katie and I got to catch up and Joe and Rich could discuss Nintendo to their hearts content. All in all it was a great time. It's nice to be so close to family again, I hope we'll se a lot of each other.

      I am currently on my first temp job. It's a little bit scary, but I'm getting the hang of it ( hey, I have enough time to write this). I'm working at Interior Management, a foo foo interior decorating office. The people here are all very nice and slightly european. For the most part I am answering phones and signing for packages, not too shabby.

      So this has been an amazing few days. I'm still pinching myself, and Rich and I are still giddy.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that I'm the happiest woman in NYC.   Last Sunday, Rich and my MU chicks Megan and Laurel and I were headed to a Mariachi Brunch at a really cool looking&nbsp;place called Chango.&nbsp;As we&nbsp;were being seated&nbsp;I noticed this wierd table&nbsp;hiding behind their menus.&nbsp;As I looked closer I saw that&nbsp;it was Meghan...and Pat...and Katie !!! The whole family&nbsp;was there.&nbsp;Dad said, "You didn't think we'd miss your're big showcase did you?" I cried, I was so excited. Rich told me that he called them a few weeks ago to tell them how much I'd love it if they could&nbsp;be there, and set up the big surprise. I was just thrilled. It was so&nbsp;great to know that they'd be there to cheer me on through such a stressful event!&nbsp;&nbsp;   The showcase went so well, my classmates and I had an amazing time at the showcase. We really ended on a high note, and had so much fun sharing the stage together for the last time.   After the showcase we all went to a reception at a really fabulous restaurant on theatre row. We all talked and congratulated each other, and waited anxioulsy to get the tally of agents who wanted to meet with each of us. As we waited Rich clinked his glass to make a toast (not surprising, as he's the usual toast-maker of the group)&nbsp; he raised a glass to our faculty, to our classmates, and finally to me. Now, at this point I was embarrassed, I thought he was silly to &nbsp;be toasting me, until he started to explain the REAL reason he'd brought my family to NYC, and why his father was there ,&nbsp;as he went down on one knee and pulled a beautiful ring out of his pocket- I couldn't believe it, it finally sank in... Oh My Gosh, He's asking me to marry him!  I&nbsp;was so happy and surprised I don't think I could breathe. I cried and we kissed and I said YES! OOh, it was so exciting. The most wonderful part was having all my firends and family around to share in such an amazing night.&nbsp; Megan and Laurel and I had gotten a hotel room for the night -so after much partying we made our way back, and giggled until the wee hours of the morning.   The last three days have been spent trying to narrow down times and dates and venues. We're thinking Mankato next summer, which is so exciting...but as Mom has warned me- not too far away!   Rich and&nbsp;I are&nbsp;also following up on the responses we got from our showcase. Rich did extremely well. He's had meetings with agents and managers every day this week and they have all been very enthusiastic about him. I made the rounds today at the offices of the agents who are interested in me, and I hope to have meetings very soon.   This is all so thrilling and overwhelming. It's been so exciting spreading the word.   I'm getting married...wooooohooooo!

      So I may just be at the&nbsp;cushiest temp job ever, it's in Jersey City, which is a bit of a hike, but the office is right on the water with a beautiful view of NYC. I'm a relief receptionist. When the actual receptionist goes to lunch, I answer the phones- the other seven hours of the day I read, or play on the internet (I feel slightly guilty about this, but not guilty enough to do anything about it.)Last night I was talking to the Jersey-born security guy, and halfway through our conversation he stops and says, "So what, you're from Ohio?"...I couldn't believe it. I said, "Yeah, I'm from Minnesota, but I just moved here from Cleveland!" He said-"It's written all over you,(I laughed)&nbsp;Oh you're so Midwestern!"  I got a showcase outfit: A semi skimpy(but still classy) brown&nbsp;lace camisole with nice tailored&nbsp;beige pants and brown pumps. I think it'll look just right. I hope.  &nbsp;

      I had the most wonderful weekend.&nbsp; Thursday night Rich and I took the train up to New Haven to spend the night with Kate and Joe. We went out for Pizza, and had possibly too many laughs, it was a riot. We awoke to the sound of Katie putting on the finishing touches&nbsp;to the travel kit she made&nbsp;for our trip. It was complete with trashy tabloids and enough diet coke and m&amp;m's to&nbsp;set us up for hours. I have the nicest sister in the world- she amazes me, with how hard she works I don't know how she manages to be so thoughtful , but she always is. The trip to Ohio took a bit longer than expected due to construction, we listened to one CD ( the new Beastie Boys, which Joe had given us, again, how nice are they?) over and over and over again. Once in Columbus we went to the Groom's house for a party where Rich played Poker and I got to meet all the family. Saturday we had breakfast with Rich's Mom and Grandma, who were lovely. And after the utimate dude-lunch at BW3 w/ Rich and his Dad, we got set for the wedding and took off for the church.  The wedding was lovely, his cousin was a beautiful beaming bride, and all went well.&nbsp; The reception was WILD! Rich's family certainly knows how to party- The bride even did a kegstand on the dance floor (on a $100 bet from the father of the groom). It was SO FUN! I got to know Rich's family much better, and had a wonderful night. Sunday we got a late start heading pack to New Haven, we'd planned on dropping off th car that night and taking the late train back to NYC.&nbsp;Again the traffic was not on our side, and we&nbsp;ended up relying on The Smentek's hospitality yet again. We missed the drop off time for the rental car&nbsp; and didn't get to New Haven until about 1am. Joe (katie was on-call) waited up and got us all settled in for the night. This morning we were supposed to make the 6:30 train to NYC so that Rich would make it in time to his new temp job at 9....unfortunately we overslept. Typical. We rushed in enough time to dress, drop off the car at the airport, and make it to the train by 7:45.&nbsp; We got to NYC at about 9:30. Luckily&nbsp;Rich's boss was very understanding. The Showcase is one week from today so I spent the day shopping for an outfit...it's coming along.&nbsp;I set out to find pants, shoes, and a jacket, and as of right now-&nbsp;I have a top. I'm going for something kind of casual but slightly elegant,&nbsp;and I guess I'm being just a bit picky,&nbsp;hmph. My two best friends from&nbsp;Marquette, Megan and Laurel are coming&nbsp;into town this weekend and I may enlist them to be my shopping experts. Tomorrow I start a reception job in Jersey&nbsp;City for the rest of the week, I just hope I can find the place!&nbsp;

       Believe it or not, I've actually been enjoying my job at the law office of Kagen, Lubic, Lepper, Lewis and Gold. I've been tucked away in the library putting leases together, mostly stapling and stamping. Yesterday the woman who's been in charge of me came in and asked:       "So Virginia what do you do when you're not stamping and stapling?" To which I replied:  "I'm an actor. I just moved to NYC from graduate school."  "Oh, are you a member of Actor's Equity?"  "Yes, I am."     "Do you have an agent?"  "Not yet, but I have a showcase a week from next monday, and I'm hoping something comes of that."    "Well, My husband works with the New Jersey Rep, and we're having dinner with the board of directors tomorrow night, and I'd be happy to pass anything along to them for you if you like."!!!!!  "I actually have a headshot and resume in my purse, here." ( I'm so glad I actually had one on me!)     "This is great, I'll pass it along, I can't promise you anything, but who knows?"   She made my day. Even if my headshot ends up sitting in her desk, it was so nice to be reminded that there are nice people out there who want to give you a hand. This same woman has subsequently extended my job at the office for the next week, giving me some much needed security and piece of mind.  Tomorrow, my classmate Cat and I are going to The Atlantic Theatre Company to audition for their season, followed by an afternoon of  filing at the office, after which Rich and I take the train to New Haven. I can't wait. Kate will be post-call, which always makes for a good time,(She gets super punchy and giggly)!  Friday Rich and I head out for Columbus, I can't wait for the drive. I've never been a nature-buff, but the idea of long streatches of trees sounds fantastic. It'll be nice to see his fam, and I'm sure his cousin's wedding will be really fun.

      So the coffee shop thing didn't work out....bummer. It was an awesome place, but unfortunately paid less than a 7th grade babysitting job. So for now, the temp-athon continues. Lately I've been stapling and stamping at a law firm, at least it's good for my arms? I may have an audition later this week, an open call for a theatre's upcomming season. It'd be a treat.

        I've had a lovely week here in the Big Apple. Katie D. came down to celebrate the 4th with Rich and I, and we had a blast! Kate got into town Saturday night and we took her to the village to my new fave-  Johnny Rocket's - an awesome malt-shop with killer chilli cheese fries! Then we went to  The People's Improv Theatre   (or,  The P.I.T .) To see a live improvised movie. It was fascinating; Three teams of actors armed with cameras were given suggestions by the audience, then sent out to the streets to improvise scenes based on the suggestions. When each team finished a scene, a runner would take a tape into the theatre, and hand it off to the in-house editor who'd play it for us. Each team's bunch of scenes, rapidly put togther, combined to make a whole movie- all created while we were watching. It was so fast paced, and exciting, it was a totally different kind of theatre than I had ever seen....except maybe for the opening act- a scary mime/clown guy. He was a provocateur appropriately named  The Red Bastard  who succeeded in totally freaking out the Donohoe chicks. On Sunday we went to Roosevelt Island for the ultimate fireworks view. We could see three perfectly synchronized displays from where we were, and they were amazing. But the best part of the holiday was getting to hang with my sister, I still can't believe we're so close to Kate and Joe. In fact, Rich and I are going to stay with them next Thursday before we head off to Columbus, OH for his cousin's wedding.      Tuesday night I met up with an old Marquette buddy, Monica West. She's been pursuing an acting career in NYC since graduation. She's been acting a lot and just got her first really big break...She's  starring  in  Lady With A Lapdog  , the second show of the season at  The Guthrie , that's right,  The Guthrie . I'm so excited for her, and she seemed just thrilled.  It was wonderful to catch up and talk shop with such a good friend who's living the dream!       I got a job this week....no, not an acting job, but definitely one more enjoyable than temping. I'm a barista at a lovely little local coffee shop called  71 Irving Place . I just started yesterday. It's sooo cute, and all the employees are these funny little actor guys who made me laugh. It felt great to get paid to do somethining that I actually  know  how to do, and actually  like  doing( I worked at a coffee shop called  The Brew Bayou  all through college, my favorite non-acting job to date). The pay isn't great, so I don't know how long it'll last, but for now it's nice to have a fun job on the side.       I'm less than three weeks away from my showcase and the pressure is ON. I'm on a mission to find something to wear. I have to find one outfit that shows ME. It's proving daunting. Having a "look" is a big part of actor marketing, and I'm starting to think that I have no personal style. If you have any suggestions please email me. vmdonohoe@hotmail.com OR my new email  virginia.donohoe@gmail.com    Oooh and if you want to hear the other side of the story, ( this is for you Aunt Katie!) You can check out Rich's Blog at   www.richsommer.com     He's got lots of pics and fun links....I hope to catch up eventually!

      So, as you can probably tell, I haven't had a lot of access to a computer lately. I've been working some fascinating temp jobs. One involved about twenty minutes of actual work, delivering mail to to people at their desks (the other seven hours and forty minutes were spent making To Do lists and reading the nerdy- though all too alluring book Katie D. passed on to me-  The Golden Compass ) Today I spent four hours putting mailing addresses on envelopes...hmmm, maybe this temp thing isn't so bad afterall? Monday night I went to my first Club. Becky Poole (a very good friend of mine from high school, who's been living here since college) led me through a  very conspicuous-looking part of town to what looked like an abandoned building that turned out to be  The Coral Room  . This club's claim to fame is that the walls are made up of huge aquariums where women dressed as mermaids can be found swimming every half hour. It was pretty awesome. I'd never seen anything like that before.  Last night Rich and I went to see a show at Chicago City Limits. He's been rehearsing with them for a couple of weeks, and wants to see as many of the performances as he can before he actually takes the stage. It was HILARIOUS! I think he's gonna be in really great company, the actors were very funny. It'll be such a riot when he gets to perform with all of them. I'm still not sure what we're doing for the 4th. Rich's family will be in town friday, and Katie D. and I have been playing phone tag. It may just be spent checking out the fireworks in the Park, which is not too shabby at all.
