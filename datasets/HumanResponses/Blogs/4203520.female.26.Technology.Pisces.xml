       My mom and I took Tea at the  urlLink Chateau Laurier  this afternoon.  I have never experienced traditional english tea before and it was an excellent experience.   The tea was, of course, stellar. The edibles were an excellent selection of different flavors and tastes and textures. The staff were also really helpful and made feel very comfortable.

       I stopped in briefly at my  urlLink housemate's  blog before going to bed and was reminded of a conversation earlier today.  I was at the dentist talking with the receptionist about living situations. She is living with her husband and one of her four sisters. Her sister moved in for a month a year ago, the situation is tense to say the least. I mentioned that my  urlLink husband  and I live with another couple in a townhouse. She said "Gosh! That must be awkward". And I was struck once again by how completely not awkward the move and cohabitation has been so far.  Andrew and I have been married for 8 years and Eons and his wife have been together for about that long too. Eons and I were in the same class at college but only really got to know eachother after working at the same place after graduation.  I find it surprising, yet also somehow comforting that living with another couple, especially this particular couple has been so relaxed and fun and funny. It's been nice to have a little change in routine, to see how other people live their lives on a slightly more personal scale than friends, even close friends normally get to see.

       I added the "BlogThis!" link to my toolbar and i'm just giving it a whirl.   I like to see things like this and the Google Toolbar, and a few other toolbar addin's I think, generally, they will make the Web Browser an easier to use application and if integrated with up-and-coming UI tools (I believe asp.net has some windows forms support for the web built into it) the web browser would make an awesome generic application host.

       I got contact lenses last week. Today I got a new right eye contact as the original one I had wasn't exactly the right perscription. I really like the new lenses.  I've worn glasses since I was about 14 or so. The start of grade 9.  I hadn't really noticed how much wearing glasses had changed how I look at the world.  So it's an experiment in body modification, of a sort.

       First blog entry. I set this up so I could post a comment on sofoski's blog. But I'll also post some stuff here, maybe some pictures too. Digital cameras are wonderful.
