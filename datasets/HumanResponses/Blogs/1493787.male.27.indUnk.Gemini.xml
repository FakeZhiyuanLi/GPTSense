						   I'm pissed.  I just found out today that this f**ckin company I'm working for is paying me $2.00 less per/hr than they told me they were when I was hired!!!  Apparently it's written in the fine print on one of the forms they had me sign.  I've got to find another job...Quickly!!!!!!!!!  In lighter news, I'm gonna go see X2 today and the All-Star race is on tonight, so my day should improve quite a bit.  Hey Guys!  Guess what?  It's the end of the week....Time for the  urlLink Weekly Wrap-Up!!!   This is perfect 'cause it's supposed to rain for most of the day...   1. Do you like rain? Why or why not?  No!  A light shower is OK at times, but rain, in general, is just loud and messy and depressing.   2. As a child, what did you do when it rained?  Watched TV :)   3. What is currently your favorite rainy day activity? Why?  um...Ironically, It's watching TV, hehe.   4. Describe the best rainy day experience you've ever had.  Can't remember any good ones.   5. Suggest a good video/DVD rental for a rainy day. Why did you pick this movie?  "Lord of the Rings"  It's an amazing movie and the extended version is over 3 1/2 hours long.  Perfect for a rainy day indoors.   LinktoComments('3')    urlLink Comment

I am in heaven.  Truck race now, practice later.  Gotta go to work 1/2 day tomorrow, that's gonna suck.  I might go see a movie tomorrow afternoon...I'm thinking about seeing X-Men 2.  Whoops! Race is back on, L8R.  LinktoComments('2')    urlLink Comment

						   I've got to tell you guys about the amazing thing that happened last week.  I went to see the  urlLink Avril Lavigne  tour here in St. Louis.  I went with a new friend I met on the internet...yeah, I know, that's how some rapists and serial killers work, but she's not a murderer and we had a wonderful time.  I think I have a new best friend, hehe.  That show was a spiritual experience for me.  Can you tell I'm a big fan?  Anyway, I had the greatest night of my entire life, I'm still on a high from the show.  I would feel great if I wasn't sick.  Figures doesn't it?  I have the best time of my life and then get the flu!!!  Oh well :(  LinktoComments('MANUAL')    urlLink Comment

						   WOW!!!  I feel better today :)  Got an incredible amount of support from a few friends, and I'm at least a little happier.  Life still sucks, but, oh well.  I just bought Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for PC.  Now that game makes me feel better.  There's nothing like a little wanton destruction to cheer a guy up, hehe.

						   I took off work today to look for a new job.  No good leads.  I desperately need to find something.  I don't know how much longer I can do this.  I feel like my entire world is crashing down around me, and no one cares.  I know that's not true...I have friends (M.J., Bob, Spidey, etc.), but I know I'm destined to live my life alone.  I've never been able to maintain success in anything, and no one in my life ever seems to stick around through the rough times.  I keep thinking that will change, but it just keeps happening to me over and over again.  I just cut my hand cleaning up a spill, I've been sick for an entire week, and I've hurt myself accidentally once a day since Sunday.  Maybe some part of me is telling me that I don't deserve to live anymore, and I can't help but think that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Dont worry, I'm not quite that stupid, but the thought of it seems to make me feel better.  Is that completely insane?  My friend "Spidey" is coming to town in June and wants me to drive back to Florida with him and look for a job down there.  Maybe moving away and getting a fresh start somewhere else would do me some good.  I just can't look at my life objectively with everything that's going on here.  I need time to think and evaluate who I am and where this life is headed.  If anyone has any thoughs, feel free to leave some comments.  I think I'm going to go for a drive and clear my head.  Good Night...  LinktoComments('6')    urlLink Comment

						   It's Monday...time for the  urlLink Monday Mission  presented by Promoguy!!!   1. This seems to be the year for movie sequels (Terminator 3, Matrix Reloaded, 2 Fast 2 Furious, LOTR: The Return of the King, etc.). Is there a movie you would like to see Hollywood make a sequel to?  I would love to see a sequel to Spawn.  That movie was really strange, but it was entertaining and had a lot of potential for a sequel.    2. What movie sequel do you think should never have been made?  I'm having a hard time thinking of a good one at the moment...    3. Are there any books (comic, novel, etc.) that you would like to see made into a movie? Who should star in it?  Not really a big book reader, sorry :(    4. When was the last time the you got a shot at the Doctor's office? Do you prefer them in the arm or your backside? Or would you rather just take a  prescription?  My last shot was a flu shot, but that was at work.  I don't remember the last time I got one at a doctor's office.  Like most everyone else, I much prefer a prescription to getting stabbed with a needle.    5. Do you make friends easier in "Real Life" or online or is it about the same? Do you have closer friendships in "Real Life" or online? Why do you think that is? Are you ok with that or would you like to make a change?   Not really a fair question for me, I've never been able to keep friends for a long period of time.  They just seem to get tired of me and they leave me alone, but to answer the question.  I tend to make friends easier in "real life".  It's better when you can actually be with the person and get to know them, It's too easy to be false when communicating online.  I have closer relationships with people in "real life".  On the other hand, I just met a new friend online (M.J.) and she is an amazing person.  I'm really looking forward to getting to know her better.  So, I'm gonna leave the rest of this answer open, because I think my view may change shortly. :)    6. When you first got your drivers license how did you feel ? Did you get it on the first try, second, third, more than that ? Do you have a license ? If  no, do you plan to get one ? Why or why not ?  Second try, I failed the first time.  I was terrified when I first got it.  I was a very nervous driver at first.  It took 2 years before I could drive with the radio on, hehe.    7. Have you ever had your tonsils removed? Did you ever come close? Tell me about that.  Yep, they have been removed.  Happened when I was about 2.  IT HURT!!!!!  They heard me scream on the other side of the hospital, hehe.    BONUS: Who's that girl?  What???  LinktoComments('5')    urlLink Comment

						   God, this weekend seemed way too short.  I can't believe I have to go work in hell tomorrow.  I slept in today, didn't get up for most of the day.  At least I'm well rested, hehe.  Well, X2 was incredible, better than the first X-Men movie.  Can't wait to see Matrix Reloaded, that's on tap for next weekend.  Well, I better get to bed, even though I've only been up for about 9 hrs.  I'll post more tomorrow.  Have a good Monday guys :)  LinktoComments('4')    urlLink Comment

						   I'M FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I just got a new job today, I start Monday.  It's not exactly my dream job, but it's 100x better then the hell I've been in.  I'm so excited, I get to quit my job...YES!!!  So, my life is looking up.  I also made an appt. to get the hail damage on my car fixed on Monday.  My outlook is sooo much better now.  Plus, I get to go see a movie this weekend.    OK, Time for the  urlLink Friday Five!    1. What do you most want to be remembered for?  Being a good friend.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?  "Go Big or Go Home" --Kyler Storm   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?  I've had a really really bad year.  Not much in the way of achievements.   4. What about the past ten years?  Probably coming out of my depression and becoming a healthy, happy human being.  Boy, That didn't last long, hehe.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  Be the best person you can possibly be, no matter what anyone else does or says.  At the end of the day, the only person's opinion that really matters is your own.  LinktoComments('12')    urlLink Comment

						   Well, Promoguy went on vacation, so the  urlLink Monday Mission  is a little late...Sorry!    Here Goes:   1. What's the worst thing about Mondays?  Having to get back in working mode.   2. Do you believe in soul mates? Have you met yours yet?  YES!!!  I thought I had for a while, but I was very very wrong.  I have not met mine yet, and don't expect to, unfortunately.   3. What do you recall wanting to "be" when you were a child, dreams of what you'd do when you were an adult for work - who you'd live with... where you'd live... how many kids you'd have. How does the dreams you once had compare to your reality, same, much different? You have surpassed those dreams?   I wanted to be a race car driver, living alone with no kids in California.  Boy, that dream didn't come true, hehe.  I have not even come close to seeing that dream.  Although, the alone part seems to be coming true.   4. What do you think of education in your town/city? In your country? How would you improve it?  Education in the US sucks.  Adults don't put enough faith in the children of this country.  I do believe kids these days are a little screwed up, but so were we at that age.   5. If you had to pick three songs to sum up your life what would they be and why?  1. Matchbox Twenty - Unwell 2. Avril Lavigne - Losing Grip 3. Stonesour - Bother   6. Do you believe in love at first sight? Can it really happen?  YES!!!  I do believe it happens, not to me, but it happens.   7. What's your greatest fear?  Being abandoned by everyone I know..........AGAIN!!!  LinktoComments('10')    urlLink Comment

						   MY BIRTHDAY PARTY IS TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!    I can't wait.  Tonight is going to be sooo much fun, assuming anyone actually shows up :(  Oh well, gotta work 1/2 day today, then it's party time.  I'll post an entry after the party and let you guys know what happened.   urlLink Weekly Wrap-Up  time...    1. Do you like to have your picture taken? Why or why not?  um...NO!  I do not photograph well.  I love taking pics of others, just keep the camera away from me.   2. What is your earliest memory of having your picture taken?  I honestly cannot remember.   3. What is the best picture you've ever had taken (or took of yourself)? Why did you pick this photo?  I don't think I've ever had a really good pic taken of me.  I just do not come off well on film.  The best picture I've ever taken, from an artistic standpoint is  urlLink here.   This was taken at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas.  This is the ceiling of the lobby.  I pointed the camera straight up and shot a picture.   4. Ladies, under what circumstances would you pose for a "glamour shot"? Gentlemen, would you want your girlfriend/wife to pose for a "glamour shot"? Both: why?  Never!  I don't like girls to look all "Glamoury".  Is that a word?  I like girls to be normal, they don't need all kinds of make-up and glamourizing stuff.  Just be yourself and be normal.   5. Would you ever pose for nude photos? Why or why not?  NO CHANCE IN HELL!!!  Never in a million years...not if the fate of the world depended on it.  There, I think I got my point across, hehe.  LinktoComments('17')    urlLink Comment

						   I've got to tell you guys about my favorite new CD.  I just got  urlLink Third Eye Blind's  new album "Out of the Vein".  It's incredible, I can't stop listening to it.  If you get a chance, check it out.  A couple more people are coming to the party, so my birthday should be fun.  I'm actually off work today, so I get to relax all day and do nothing.  Then, I've got to work a half day tomorrow :(  Oh Well....Time for the  urlLink Friday Five!    1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?  Drive a race car.  I want to do a driving experience some day.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?  Absolutely!!!  You can't be a good friend and be dishonest.  Even if it's a negative comment, you have to tell the truth.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?  Yep!  I found out a really close friend of mine was doing drugs, and had been for years.  I got very upset and overreacted (as usual).  That was some time last year, and our friendship hasn't been the same since.  I really miss her.     4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?  I want to live in the Anime series Zoids.  Planet Zi is a really cool place and I want to be a zoid pilot, hehe.   5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?  Maybe the talent to drive a race car.  Who knows, I could be the next Dale Earnhardt.......well....maybe not, lol.  LinktoComments('15')    urlLink Comment

						   It's time for the  urlLink Monday Mission     1.  Have you ever just totally trashed something you were working on because it wasn't going the way you wanted? What happened? Did you start over again? Was it better?  Many times!!!  I don't deal with frustration well.  I always start things over again, and most of the time they work out great.   2.  Have you ever contacted an old friend out of the blue over the internet? How did it go? Have any old friends or lovers ever contacted you? Did it flatter you or freak you out?  Nope.  I don't have any friends that I've been out of contact with for a long time.   3.  What is the most important thing that you have ever forgotten? Did it have any negative results? How did it all turn out?  um.....I can't remember!   4.  Which of the "reality" television programs do you think you would have a chance at winning? Why? Would you ever actually consider signing up for one? Have you?  I hate reality TV.  I would never go on one of those stupid shows.   5. Do you allow commenting on your blog? Why?  Have you ever considered removing/adding that function? What was one of the worst situations you've found yourself in due to blog comments?   Yes I do!  I allow commenting so others can give me their reactions and opinions to the things I post.  I can't imagine anything too negative coming from it.   6. Have you found any cool shareware/freeware applications/scripts/tools recently? Yeah? Tell me more!  Not lately.   7.  One of my favorite terms I've heard a Minster use was when he refereed to a "pet sin." Which is when you live your life right for the most part, but you have this one secret thing, this one bad thing that you do that is wrong for you to do, that you won't give up, even though you know you should (and sometime criticize others for doing). Now I am not asking to know what it is, but do you have a "pet sin?" When did it start? Are you trying to give it up, or are you just reconciled to the fact that you will always have it? Would anyone think less of you if they knew about it?  um....Yes!  There is one thing that I'm not proud of, but I'm not telling  :)   Yes, I have tried giving it up, but it doesn't seem to work.

						   OK, I must apologize to everyone that reads this site.  I started my new job and haven't updated all week.  Sorry guys.  As far as the new job goes, It's not too bad.  I met a couple of friends down there and it looks like a nice place to stay for a while.  I'm feeling a lot better about my future and the job situation.  On the other hand, I'm having a birthday party next weekend and so far, it's not going extremely well.  I invited everyone I know and so far M.J. is the only one that is coming for sure.  A few can't come and a few people aren't sure.  I haven't heard anything at all from the rest.  I hope people show up.  I remember last year at my friend Bel's birthday party, I was the only one that showed up.  I don't want to be in her shoes this year.  It's kind of ironic, one part of my life is getting better, while another part is going downhill.  Why can't I just be happy?  Why does something always have to be missing in my life?

						   Time for the  urlLink Friday Five.    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?  Straight and Short   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  Used to be plain and straight, now it's kind of spikey and wavy.  Only 2 hairstyles in my life...God I'm boring.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?  As previously stated...Spikey and Wavy.   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  A lot more spikey.  I wish it stood up more.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  Fortunately never.  I've had fairly good luck with hair cuts.  LinktoComments('19')    urlLink Comment

						   Sorry for the late update.  Well, the B-Day party was kind of a bust.  M.J. was the only one that showed up.  Nice to know who your real friends are :(  In a way, I'm glad no one else showed up, M.J. and I just came back to my house and hung out all night.  We actually had a really great time.  I'm still upset no-one else came, but I'm not going to beg people to spend time with me.  In other news, work is getting better.  I started training for a new job within the same department, I should start this week.  It's a lot nicer position.  I just got my tax refund and I get paid tomorrow!!!  It feels sooo good to actually have some money, even if it's already spent on overdue bills, oh well.    LinktoComments('16')    urlLink Comment

						   Believe it or not, I went out and saw The Hulk again.  My friend Dusty and I were going to see The Italian Job, or Bruce Almighty, but he decided he wanted to see Hulk at the last minute.  I think it's better the second time around.    I was in the car with M.J. last weekend and we were listening to Third Eye Blind.  The song "Company" came on and I really understood the lyrics for the first time.  In a way this song reminds me of myself most of the time.  Here's the first verse and chorus so you have some idea what I'm talking about...   Can we get the chemicals in  Cause anything’s better than this  Mix it up with vicadin  Cause anything’s better than this  Little cuts on your wrist,  To try and get back the feeling  And no real friendships exist  That would be an understatement   Tell me the reason  (cannot show up)  Friends you knew before  (hello, how have you been?)  This is your season  (oh I give up)  Just show up  (I can’t knock on your door)   Cause I keep bad company  I’m trouble  So go on stay away from me  I play the villain  You don’t know where we’ve been    And now for the  urlLink Friday Five!    1. How are you planning to spend the summer?  I can't afford a vacation this year, so I'll just spend my summer hanging out with M.J., B.H. and my other friends.  I could think of worse ways to spend a summer, hehe.   2. What was your first summer job?  Unloading vans at the neighborhood corner store with my best friend Chris.   3. If you could go anywhere this summer, where would you go?  Viva Las Vegas Baby!!!!   4. What was your worst vacation ever?  My family and I went to Florida when I was a kid.  It rained every single day we were there and we were stuck inside the whole trip.   5. What was your best vacation ever?  Honestly, my best trip ever wasn't a vacation.  It was a business trip I took with my ex-friend Belinda to Indiana.  We worked both days we were there, but I had the best time of my life hanging out with her.  I miss her a lot.  I would miss her more if she wasn't such a bitch.  LinktoComments('21')    urlLink Comment

						   Movie Review:   THE HULK   M.J. and I went to see THE HULK this weekend.  It was actually really good, it started really slow, but they more than made up for it at the end.  The coolest part was that Lou Ferrigno actually had a cameo in the film, that was very cool.  The CG Hulk in the film looked very realistic, not at cheesy as I thought he would.  If you haven't seen it yet, everyone should definitely go.  The movie was great, but the highlight of the night for me was getting to hang out with M.J. again.  We had a great time and I can't wait to do it again.  LinktoComments('20')    urlLink Comment

						   I am seriously considering not going into work tomorrow.  I'm supposed to be off on Thursday, but I just realized my training this week is going to take at least 4 days.  I have no choice but to work on Thursday.  Remember when I said I kinda like this company I'm working for?  Forget it, I've got to get the hell out of this place.  They've done nothing but lie to me and screw me over since the day I started working there.  This place f'n sucks.  I really wanted to hang out and watch a movie with MJ this week, but I don't think that's gonna happen since I have no idea when I have a day off.  I'm going to go in and yell at my boss Monday morning.  On top of all of that, I have just been feeling wrong the last couple days.  I can't describe it, I just feel like something very bad is coming.  Over the years, I've learned to trust my feelings, and that has me very worried about my life.

						   HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY!!!!!!!  Hope everyone had a great 4th of July.   I just got back inside from watching the fireworks around town.  There is a hill in my backyard that you can see fireworks from the whole town going off.  It's really beautiful to watch from up there.  One of these years, I'm going to have someone up there to watch with me, instead of being by myself.  In other news, I had the day off work today.  I was scheduled to work, but someone changed the schedule on me.  They switched my day off on my day off.  That kind of sucks 'cause I needed the cash.   Oh Well, at least I had fun today.  I watched the BGN race from Daytona and played Vice City all day.  M.J. and I went to see Terminator 3 yesterday.  That movie Rocks!!!  It follows the storyline perfectly and is a great end to the Terminator saga.  LinktoComments('22')    urlLink Comment

						   I'm feeling OK now.  Not sure why I was feeling so bad, but it's just fine now.  Work's better now, too.  I got stuck working 6 days in a row, but it made up for a day I missed last week, so I don't mind too much.  I'm off work on Saturday, I would love to do something with MJ, but I don't know if that's gonna happen this week.  I am exhausted and going to sleep, but first...... urlLink The Friday Five.    1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?  YES!  His name was Chris, he was a great kid.  We had a lot of fun together.   2. Are you still in touch with this person?  Unfortunately No.  We moved away from each other during the great flood of '93.  Haven't seen him since.   3. Do you have a current close friend?  MJ!!!  My buddy, I love that girl.   4. How did you become friends with this person?  Strangely enough, through the internet.  We met on the Avril Lavigne fan club.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?  Belinda.  I'm not sure she ever really considered us "friends", but I still miss her.

						   I'm off work all weekend!!!  MJ was supposed to come over today, but that didn't happen.  I'm not sure what happened to her.  The day wasn't a total bust, a local restaurant had a classic car cruise today.  I went and checked out the cars all day.  Can't wait 'til Thursday...I'm going to see a U2 Tribute band called  urlLink Elevation USA.   That's gonna be a great night.  It is Saturday....time for the  urlLink Weekly WrapUp...      1. What song (new or old) do you secretly enjoy, but publicly ridicule? Why?  When I was a kid...I'm sorry to say it was "Hanging Tough" by The New Kids on the Block.  I used to love that song, but I always made fun of the girls that listened to it.   2. Do you carry a purse or tote bag or backpack? If so, what's inside?  Nope.  Not real big on purses.   3. Describe your dream job. Why did you select this one?  NASCAR Driver!!!  I'm a racing nut, I eat, sleep, and dream NASCAR.   4. You are given an opportunity to live anywhere in the world, expense free, but you can never move again. Where do you live? Why?  Viva Las Vegas Baby!!!!!  I love that city.  I want to move there very badly.   5. What do you like about living in your particular city? Would you recommend it to others as a good place to live and work? Why?  I like St. Louis.   It's a relatively friendly town (if you avoid North STL and the east side).  I would recommend STL to friends to move to.  Working here kind of sucks, there's not a ton of opportunity in a lot of fields than other cities.   6. You have a superpower. What is it? What do you do with it? Do you tell anyone?  Telepathy.  I've had a long history of being hurt by people I thought were friends.  It would be nice to be able to tell who was being genuine to me.   7. What five people, living or dead, famous or not, do you wish lived on your block?  MJ - Britney Spears - Bel - Avril - Spidey  LinktoComments('27')    urlLink Comment

						   Well, It's 3:30 in the morning.  What am I doing awake you ask?...NOTHING!!!  I took a nap earlier tonight, and I just can't sleep.  So, I'm watching TV 'till I get sleepy.  Believe it or not, there's actually some pretty good things on TV this time of night.  I just finished watching the Evanescence video for "Bring me to life" on VH1, now they've got coldplay on.  Oh cool...Batman just came on!!!  Not the new one, but the original '60's Batman series.  I love this show, it's sooo corny it's fun to watch.  They're doing an episode in England, but instead of London, they're calling it Londinium, hehe.  GOD, why am I up watching this crap.  The truly sad part is that I have to wake up in about 6 hours to get ready for work.  I'm thinking that's not gonna happen, oh well.  I guess I should try to get some sleep.  Good Night Internet peoples.  LinktoComments('26')    urlLink Comment

Anyway, MJ is coming over tomorrow, we're gonna hang out and watch DareDevil among other things, hehe.  Can't wait for that, since she couldn't come over tonight 'cause I'm working.  I'm stuck here for 2 1/2 more hours...this sucks.  Not really supposed to be online here, but I had to write something.

						   Once again I must apologize for the lack of updates.  I've been extremely tired lately, not sure why, just tired.  I had a great time at the concert Thursday night.  Elevation was amazing!!!  Not quite the real U2, but I couldn't tell the difference.  I got my car refinanced last week, saved $41 per month on my car payment.  Heard from MJ, she didn't come over cause her car broke down.  That sucks, but I'll see her soon enough.  That's it...I promise I'll try and update more often from now on.  One last thing...Time for the  urlLink Monday Mission!    1. When you take a vacation, do you ever suffer from Internet withdrawal? Or maybe the nagging urge to blog or read blogs? Or are you glad to be away?  YES!!!  I suffer from major internet withdrawal on vacation.  I'm always afraid I'm going to miss a website update or an e-mail from a friend.     2. Have you ever been "furloughed" (told to take time off work without pay) or laid off? How did that impact your family dynamics? Your finances? If not to you, have you seen it happen to anyone you know? How did they handle it?  Yep, I've been laid off before, really really sucked.  It wasn't for long, so it really didn't impact the family, but it still wasn't good.   3. If you fell on hard times, what is are some non-essential reoccurring luxury expenses (cable TV, TiVo subscription, cigarettes, high-speed net connection, newspaper, daily Starbucks coffee, etc.) you would give up to save money?   The only thing I have it my DSL internet connection and there is no way I would give that up.   4. On the same thought, what is the one non-essential expense you would NOT give up?  I just answered that...DSL.   5. Would you ever ask your family (parents, in-laws, relatives) for financial assistance? What would be some of your concerns about asking for help? Have you ever asked for it before? Did it go well?  I would never ask, but I have had help before.  I helped me out a lot.   6. Has a friend or relative ever borrowed money from you? Who were they and how much did they want? Did you ever get paid back, or did it matter? Did you feel compelled to keep an eye on them to see if they spent it wisely?  I've never had a friend borrow more than $5-$10 and  I always got it back.   7. Imagine you won a tax-free gift of $7,000. The only stipulation on the gift is that it must not be invested or saved, and must be spent before 2004. How would you use the money?  I would use it to pay off my car.  Getting rid of that car payment would help a lot.  LinktoComments('28')    urlLink Comment

						   2:00am Sunday night and I'm still up!  I'm exhausted, but don't want to sleep yet.  MJ came over today and we watched DareDevil together.  That movie is sooo cool.  If anyone hasn't seen it, you have to.  After the movie, we did something totally unexpected...I drove to Alton, Il to hang out with her family at church.  Luckily, we were late, and I didn't have to sit through a church service.  We got there as soon as it ended.  Do I have great timing or what?...lol.  We had a great time, her family is pretty cool.  I got to hang with her sisters, I really like those girls.  Back to work tomorrow, don't have another day off until Friday.  MJ and I are trying to go see American Wedding next weekend.  I'll try to post some more this week and keep everyone updated.  LinktoComments('32')    urlLink Comment

						   AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!  OK, That's better :)  As you can probably tell, I've had a bad day.  This wonderful company I'm working for has just implemented several new rules that would seem absurd to a 5 yr old.  Lets see....No personal items on your desk, at all.  No pictures, unless they're in a frame.  Now, I have to go buy a frame.  I've also just been informed that soda bottles are not spillproof with the caps tightened...whatever.  There are other things, too, but I'm just a little too upset to mention them.  The job search has just kicked up a notch.  BTW: If anyone out there knows of any job openings in the St. Louis area, please leave a comment and let me know.  It's a little late in the day, but here's the  urlLink Monday Mission!!!    1. Are you good at responding to emails and/or Blog comments?   Yep.  I'm always online, so I respond to e-mails right away.   2. Does it make you crazy when people won't reply to your emails even though you know good and well that they are reading them?  YES!!!  I've actually been through this with several people.  If someone doesn't want to talk to me, they should at least have enough respect for me to reply at least once.   3. I recently watched the FOX special "101 Things Removed from the Human Body" which was quite disgusting in a can't-help-but-watch kind of way. It got me to thinking about many of the accidents I had as a child. I remember climbing over a fence after T-ball and catching my palm on the top of the chain-link fence. Went through my hand and tore it right open. What's the most unusual thing you've had inside your body?  I stuck a coat hanger through my eye once.  That wasn't fun.   4. What person from your past would you most like to run into and visit with for an afternoon? Why them? What person would you like to not ever see again as long as you live? How come?  See again...Bel.  I miss her a lot.   Never See Again...Charles.  That jerk hurt me more than I could ever say.   5. What was the last bad meal you (or your special someone) paid too much for? What's the story there?  Las Vegas last year.  We went to a restaurant that charged me $35 for a steak!  And nothing else...just a steak...no sides...no drink!!!   6. If out-of-the-blue you were forced to find a new career, if there was just suddenly no need for your field of expertise, just what job do you imagine you would seek out? Do you have any skills you can "fall back on?" (If you stay at home or are a student, adjust to fit your situation)   This doesn't really affect me, Tech Support isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  I honestly have no clue what I would do, but I would find something.   7. If you were to open up your own restaurant, what would it be called and what type of food would you serve? Describe the "feel" of the place (the decor, the music, etc).   um...American food, rock music.  Just a fun, rocking place to hang out.  LinktoComments('33')    urlLink Comment

						   MJ came down today.  We went out to see American Wedding.  I love that movie!  Not quite as good as the first two, but still great!  After the movie we came back to my house and hung out for a few hours.  I love spending time with her, I really didn't want her to leave :(  I haven't had a friend like her in a very long time.  I feel like an idiot, I accidently opened a zip file of nude pics that an old friend sent me, that I never deleted.  MJ noticed it, I feel like a complete moron now, why didn't I delete that crap.  I tried to explain to her that it wasn't mine, but I'm not sure if she actually believes me.  I should have her talk to my other friends, I NEVER LIE!!!...no, seriously, I don't like lying.  MJ left a few hours ago.  I don't know why, but I am in a horrible mood right now.  I had a really great day, but I'm really sad tonight.  Maybe remembering old friends, or maybe I'm scared.  I don't know.  I think I'm afraid of losing MJ...every time I get a really good friend, they leave me.  Did I mention I'm slightly Bi-Polar?  Just thought I'd throw that in there, so you don't think I'm a complete idiot.  I  hate these mood swings, they make me a nervous wreck.  I've been near tears for the last 2 hours.  I wish MJ didn't live so far away, because I really need a friend right now.  Anyway, while I'm here...Here's the  urlLink Weekly Wrap-Up    1. What is the earliest crush you can remember having? Who was it? How old were you? And what did you do about it?  I don't really have crushes.  Sex is a non-issue for me, so there's really nothing to fantasize about for me.   2. What celebrity did you obsess over as a teenager? How did your tastes change, if at all, during your teenage years?  My favorite celebrity when I was a teenager was gymnast Dominique Moceanu.  She was amazing, and still is, even though she's retired.  I loved to watch her.   3. What kind of crushes (i.e., real people vs celebrities) do you have now? Are they fleeting or long-lasting? How?  I think I answered that in #1.   4. What would you do now if you were face to face with your #1 crush from childhood or teenage years?  I would probably say Hi, and ask if she wanted to go see a movie.   5. Who is your #1 crush today? Why?  I keep answering this.  I don't have one.

						   It's a little late, but here's the  urlLink Monday Mission    1. When was the last time you helped out a friend in need? What was going on that made you want to help?  My friend CG wrecked her car, and I drove her home from work every day that week.  She lives an hour away from me.   2. Are you a "pet" person? Do you like to keep pets or would you rather not bother with them? Why?  I love pets, but they're a little too much work for me.   3. In a dating or married relationship, is it possible to change someone to be more like you want them to be? Have you tried to or had someone try to change you? How did it turn out?  Not in a dating relationship, but I have tried to change friends before.  It's normally a complete disaster.  I tried to keep a friend from starting to drink and smoke, and it destroyed our friendship.  Moral: Don't try to change people you care about!!!   4. In your opinion, why is it that some married people have affairs? Is it ever justified?  NO!!!   5. Do you tend to make the same mistakes over and over? Got any examples?  In personal relationships...Yep.  I almost made the same mistake mentioned above this weekend with another friend.  Came close to disaster on that one.   6. What do you find distracts you the most when you are trying to concentrate?  Everything!   7. What do you know "now," that you wish you knew "then?"  To accept people you love for who they are, no matter what they do or how they act.  Still having problems with that one.  LinktoComments('36')    urlLink Comment

Perfect Memory:  chorus: and i'll remember you and the things that we used to do and the things that we used to say i'll remember you always  but then this world  slipped through my fingers and even the sun seemed tired i still cared as i lowered you down my heart just jaded in that moment the earth made no sound but you were there you helped me lift my pain into the air  chorus: and i'll remember you and the things that we used to do and the things that we used to say i'll remember you that way  LinktoComments('43')    urlLink Comment

						   I went to the dentist today, got my filling replaced.  He actually did a really great job, it didn't hurt at all.  I'm still eating soup though, I don't want to eat anything solid until tomorrow.  In other news...This weekend isn't looking good after all.  I called about the concert, and you have to be 21 to get in, so MJ can't go.  I thought we could do something else instead, but she hasn't replied to my last e-mail, and it's been 3 days.  I tried calling her several times tonight to tell her about the show, but nobody was home, or someone was ignoring me.  Hear me...I am not going to freak out about this!  I know I start feeling all abandoned when friends don't talk to me for a while, but I LOVE HER, and I'm not going to let my fear control me on this one.  I really hope she calls or e-mails me, because I really miss her.  I've got to work tomorrow, I took the day off to go see the dentist today, so I've got to make up some hours.  Hopefully, I'm talking better tomorrow, my mouth is still numb, and my entire head is asleep.  You should hear me talk...It's funny :)  I was going to do the 3 for thursday today, but it's all about kissing, and I've never actually kissed anybody, so I really don't have much to say on the subject.

						   MY LIFE SUCKS!!!  I know I keep saying that, but this time I mean it.  I was at work today and lost a filling out of my tooth.  My entire mouth hurts like hell.  My mood has been horrible all week, I've had major issues with two of my friends, and now this.  I just can't win.  What do I have to do to be happy, even for a little while?  Everyone has something good in their life.  Even the good things in my life either go away or they're tainted from the start!   I don't know what I did to deserve all of this.  I try to be the best person I can be, and I still get abandoned, mistreated, and just plain screwed over at every turn.  OK, enough venting.  I can't wait for this weekend, MJ's coming down Saturday.  I can't wait to see her, she's one of the few things that makes me smile anymore.  We're going to try and go see a concert Saturday night.  We're going to see  urlLink Glow .  They're a local band from St. Louis.  They sound a lot like Evanescence, check them out!  I've got a dentist appointment at 3:30 Thursday (Today).  No insurance, so It's going to cost a fortune (of course).  I'll try to post more when I get back from the dentist and let you guys know how I'm feeling.

						    urlLink Weekly Wrap-Up  Time!!!   1. What was the first music video you remember seeing? What was memorable?  I don't remember the first video I saw.  Heck, I can't remember what happened yesterday, hehe.   2. What was your favorite music video as a teenager? Why?  We didn't have MTV until I was out of my teens.  God, I feel old.   3. How often did you watch MTV as a teen? How often now? Why has this changed, if at all?  Well, I definitely watch it more now.   4. Did "video kill the radio star," as The Buggles asserted in their 1980 song of the same title? Why or why not?  It definitely changed the music industry a lot, but it didn't kill the radio star.   5. What is the best music video ever made? Why?  "THRILLER"  Without a doubt.  That Michael Jackson video is the coolest, and longest, video ever made.

						   I bought a new computer monitor today.  It's nice to my computer back up and running 100%.  Gotta work tomorrow, that sucks, but I might go hang out at DG's house in the evening.  I'm kinda sad, MJ can't come over this weekend, but she did e-mail me and tell me why.  I understand, and I love her, so I'll wait a week.  Time for the  urlLink Friday Five    1. Is the name you have now the same name that's on your birth certificate? If not, what's changed?  Yep, same name!   2. If you could change your name (first, middle and/or last), what would it be?  My favorite name, and online nickname...Kyler Storm!   3. Why were you named what you were? (Is there a story behind it? Who specifically was responsible for naming you?)  I asked my Dad, but he couldn't remember any details :(   4. Are there any names you really hate or love? What are they and why?  I can't really think of any.   5. Is the analysis of your name at  urlLink kabalarians.com  accurate? How or how isn't it?  It's very accurate, I couldn't believe it.  Everyone has to try this site.  Here's my result:  Your name of Chris gives you a very happy-go-lucky, spontaneous nature. You see the humorous side of many situations and can laugh at yourself as well as at others. This name gives you a musical, artistic nature and you would do well in any occupation in the entertainment field. You have many friends because of your generous, happy nature, but if crossed you have a quick temper, although your annoyance does not last too long. You do enjoy an argument and will at times say things just to get others going and then you sit back and enjoy the debate. You lack system and order and find it very difficult to budget and save money. This name creates a nature that can be the life of the party, but many times you can become involved in emotional situations against your better judgment. Your compassionate nature causes you to be too generous and you often give more than you can afford to.   LinktoComments('47')    urlLink Comment

						   Thank God!  The week from hell is over!!!  Work is better this week, and I heard from MJ today.  Life is better :)  Now it's time for the  urlLink Monday Mission    1. How to you get motivated to do something you really hate to do?   I don't.  If I hate to do something, I'm just going to hate it.  I just decide to get it over with asap.   2. Have you ever been hypnotized? Do you think it can really be done or is it a mind trick?   I believe in it, I don't think I could be, but I think it's possible.   3. If you are married, how much did your wedding cost? Was it worth it? (the cost of the wedding, not the marriage, heh) If you aren't, how much do you think should be spent on a wedding?   I'm not a big fan of marriage.  Spend as little as possible :)   4. Have you ever looked for or bought a house? Was it fun? What is the most frustrating part of the process (looking, buying, all areas)?   I used to go looking for houses with my uncle.  I actually enjoyed seeing all the cool homes and options.   5. Do you have a quiet place where you can go and be alone? What's it like? Would you share it with someone or is it just yours?   I don't have a place I can go to often, but there is one place downtown, that I like to go when I'm in the area.  It's a platform that overlooks the Mississippi river.  It's a really cool view of the river.  I want to share it with someone.  I've been wanting to take MJ there for a while.  Hopefully soon :)   6. Summer is almost over, did you get to take a vacation yet?   Nope.  Been in and out of work this year, didn't have the cash for a vacation.   7. Do you like playing video games? What game system do you like the most (any era) or do you prefer board games?  I love video games.  My favorite console is the PS2, even though I don't own one.

						   Called MJ last night, talked to her sister.  She hasn't called me back yet, but I'm OK.  My friend KV and I went out to  urlLink The Trainwreck Saloon  for dinner last night.  We've both had a horrible week, so we went out to celebrate the end of the week from hell.  We had a great time, I encourage everyone to go eat there.  Work still sucks.  KV and I are to the point that we just don't care anymore.  We both got in trouble this week for pointing out our dislike for the new rules very publically.  I didn't go to the Glow concert last night, I couldn't get in touch with MJ, so I didn't go.  I really didn't want to go alone.  I'm just sitting around at home today, I'm taking a day to just relax and do nothing.  LinktoComments('44')    urlLink Comment

						   I'm off work today, just chillin' at home.  MJ didn't come over today, she had to go to a dinner, so I didn't get out of bed until 4:30.  I'm very "well rested", hehe.  While I'm here, time for the  urlLink Friday Five ...   1. Who is your favorite singer/musician? Why?  Avril Lavigne!!!  She's independant, funny, and an amazing singer.  Plus I met MJ through her fanclub, so I'll always be indebted to Avril for bringing us together.   2. What one singer/musician can you not stand? Why?  Anyone in the rap industry.  Jay-Z, 50 cent, DMX, and the other idiots that can't sing.   3. If your favorite singer wasn't in the music business, do you think you would still like him/her as a person?  Yes!  Definitely.  Avril seems like a blast to hang with.   4. Have you been to any concerts? If yes, who put on the best show?  Yes!  I've seen Avril, Default, Live, and Glow in concert.  No offense to Avril, but Live put on the best show by far.  Those guys are phenomenal to see in concert.  In fact, this website is named after a Live song "Overcome".   5. What are your thoughts on downloading free music online vs. purchasing albums? Do you feel the RIAA is right in its pursuit to stop people from dowloading free music?  I download music occasionally.  I don't agree with downloading all of your music, but there's nothing wrong with downloading the occasional single, or live song.  That's mostly what I get.

						    urlLink 3 for Thursday  Time!!!   1. Who are 3 people (either friends or family) that you've lost touch with that wish you could see again?   3!  You only want 3!  Not sure I can narrow it down to 3, but here goes.  Bel Drn Drk   2. What are 3 things you liked about being with these people? (like traits you admired or things you used to do with them)  Bel, was an amazing person. We used to go out dancing, and listening to music. Drn, was one of the best friends I've ever had. He taught me a lot about life. Drk, was one of the few people that truly accepted me for who I am.   3. Who are 3 people (either friends or family) that you see all the time that could do without seeing for years?   I love all my friends.  I can't imaging being without any of them.

						   Well, I'm feeling a little better.  Winamp has been turned off.  After what happened tonight, I added something to this site.  If you check the upper right corner of this page, right above the blogger button, you will see a mood indicator.  I added that so you guys can quickly see what I'm feeling at anytime.  It's a little corny, I know, but I like it :)  LinktoComments('50')    urlLink Comment

						   I'm not having a good night.  Damn mood swings.  I was going to write what I'm feeling, but I really don't know what I'm feeling.  I feel like I want to jump off the nearest bridge, but that's not going to accomplish much.  Although, it might make me feel better for 5 seconds.  I guess I should write something, so here's my current Winamp playlist.  See if you can figure out my mood...  Remy Zero - Perfect Memory Live - The Sanctity of Dreams Goo Goo Dolls - What a Scene Fountains of Wayne - Little Red Light Fountains of Wayne - Valley Winter Song Less Than Jake - Help Save the Youth of America from Exploding Green Day - Time of your life Johnny Cash - Hurt Less Than Jake - Nervous in the Alley Evanescence - Tourniquet Glow - Regret Third Eye Blind - Misfits Third Eye Blind - Motorcycle Drive-By Goo Goo Dolls - Sympathy  LinktoComments('49')    urlLink Comment
