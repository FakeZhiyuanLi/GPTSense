      Welcome to this weird place in cyber space where I'd like to call home! Here is where I'm going to post all kinds of shit for your viewing pleasure (in text only). I know what your saying! Why am I up so damn late typing like a jackass or an ASS WITH EARS!? Well I'll tell you, I decided to make a site where I can put all my ideas and other shit on here just for shits and giggles. I think I'll start with a story, and it goes like this.        Once upon a time there was a nasty disgruntled man and he lived in a disgusting shit house that was in the shape of the genitals of a gnome, and he lived with several "Camwhores". And he loved to make everybody's life miserable, until one day a really really big meteor crushed his house! Unfortunately he escaped unharmed. As he brushed himself off he turned his head and to his surprise he found himself surrounded by rabid wolves, he ran as fast as he could through the forest, but the wolves finally got him and tore him up real good. But the nasty man broke lose and began to tear through the open meadow, in a real frightful state of stampeding he tripped on a pebble and landed flat on his ugly face. As he arose he was face to face with a really big grizzly bear the bleeding poor slob screamed like a cat that had a 600 pound lady sit on it and the bear picked him up and threw him and he went flying like a vegetable out of the mouth of a burger king happy customer! And as he was falling to his certain death he actually felt sorry for being so nasty and started to repent even! And an Angel appeared and she stopped time so they could "chat"  The Angel was like " Give me one good reason why I should save your ass? The damage is already done, and it cannot be reversed. So you better make this short and sweet." the man was completely taken aback from how the angel was handling things but he tried his luck even though he felt really insecure about the situation " Dear sweet messenger of God, I beg of you to please help me out of this bind! I know I was a non believer before but I am a believer now.." He replied. The Angel thought for a minute " Well since I am an Angel and I'm supposed to do good..." The Angel paused " Yes? And??" muttered the man after dying from anticipation " YE ARE TO BE DOMED TO THY FIERY PITS OF HELL!" exclaimed the furious God. So the man went falling to his death landing on sharp rocks below, and the world was a better place and there were no such things as camhoes anymore.  The Moral of the story: Mean People suck, every nasty person in the world who does people so wrong will get there's in the end. And that's why my faith is soo strong and always will be.  I know for a fact that all mean nasty people have really fucked up lives and that's why they try to make other people's lives miserable, so they can feel better about themselves, the thing is some people, like me, have the knowledge to know what's really going on.

      I live in Florida, as some of you already know and it's piping hot here right now it's like 98 degrees, it's so hot I'm afraid if I go for a walk I'm going to melt right into the sidewalk. I'm going to college right now and I'm taking Computer animation and I just finished my first year FYI and I wanted to talk about smartasses for a minute; a few quarters ago in my school I was taking math and yes there were quite a few A holes in there but I really couldn't help it I got math anxiety and plus I kept asking a lot of questions which really annoyed everyone because the teacher was such a bore ( and that was my way of getting back) I really didn't mean any harm I was just trying to get by. BUT the teacher was a real smart mouth and he would love to call me out and make me look stupid in front of the whole class, but that's how he got his jollies off so one day I got up and told him to his face that I was real tired of his smartass big mouth attitude and I left and reported his ass to the president of the school and then I got one on one help with my math and I got a "B" and I finally passed! And I'm learning that 4th quarter is kinda rough but I'm hanging in there, we use a lot of Adobe computer software like Photoshop, AfterEffects and Adobe Illustrator. We're also learning how to use this really complicated Japanese Software called "Retas" (Pronounced Ray-toss) and inside the software they have Retas Traceman where you can either scan a drawing or make one in Photoshop or Illustrator and this awesome program will trace it for you but you have to make sure you "clean" your drawings first, meaning make sure all the erase marks or unwanted lines, then once it's traced you have to make sure all the lines are closed so when you use Retas Paintman to color it in, the color doesn't spill all over the place. And then there's Retas core, where you import all the colored drawings into to make an "Animatic" ie Animation. We also do quite a bit of hand drawn cells where there's atleast 120 frames (pages) where you have to keep drawing to make your character(s) move and we capture them with a camera and use a program called "Quick Checker" then it plays back using QuickTime. And all you Artists out there that are really good at what you do PLEASE follow your dreams and persue that career you always wanted, It's worth it. I have always been good at drawing and the smartest move I ever made was going to college to be an Animator, I love college soo much and no matter what I'll never drop out because if I did I would just be throwing my life long dream away and that's never going to happen.

       Some people are such a damn inconvenience, like at my school a few weeks ago I was having trouble with some software that I have to work with so ofcourse I'm going to ask for help; only to my dismay the teacher was a complete BUBBLEHEAD! I asked for help three flippin' times and he said he was going to help me but he left the room several times.. WTF? And no he never helped me so I left and today I went to the director of Animation and told him that I signed up for tutoring two weeks ago and that I have been very patient but I'm running out of time. He then told me that he'd send the tutor to the room I was in, and when the tutor finally came and we set a time up for tutoring  OOOooh man I was happier than a little girl with a basket full of dicks!! So I am FINALLY going to get the help I needed, yahoo. It's about fuckin time   SHEESHhhh

      FAKE PEOPLE REALLY PISS ME OFF, THE OTHER NIGHT I WAS KICKED OUT OF A ROOM FOR NO FUCKIN REASON AND NOT SO SURPRISINGLY IT WAS THE SAME DAMN PERSON WHO BOOTED ME ON NEW YEARS EVE. HOW FUCKIN LOW IS THAT??? AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, SHE SAID IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE AND WHEN CONFRONTED SHE DENIES IT, OF COURSE SHE'S NOT GOING TO ADMIT SHE'S WRONG. I AM ALSO TIRED OF BEING BLAMES FOR EVERY SHITTY THING THAT HAPPENS AROUND ME OR TO ME, IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T WANT ME AROUND ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SAY SO AND I'LL LEAVE; THERE'S NO NEED TO GET NASTY OR RUDE, AND YES I AM REAL RUDE TO THE ONES I DISLIKE. I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE THAT SAY REAL MEAN SHIT AND THEN THEY WONDER WHY I'M SUCH A BITCH, NOW YOU KNOW. FIGHT ROOM PEOPLE ARE A JOKE, THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE TURMOIL IN THEIR LIVES AND THEY WILL GO WAY TO FAR JUST TO FUCK SOMEBODY OVER. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN THEIR SHIT THROWN OUT THERE AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE THEY TRUSTED THE WRONG PERSON, LUCKILY THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED TO ME PROBABLY BECAUSE I TRUST NO ONE. TONS OF PEOPLE HAVE PRETENDED TO BE MY "FRIEND" AND IT ALWAYS TURNS OUT THEY'RE ANYTHING BUT FRIENDS, AND FOR THE RECORD I DO NOT HAVE ANY "FIGHT ROOM FRIENDS". I REALLY HATE DRAMA, SOME PLACES ARE FULL OF DRAMA, I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE FIGHT ROOMS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL IN FUN; BUT THE REAL TRUTH IS AS I LEARNED, IT'S ALL FULL OF CLICKY PEOPLE IN THEIR CLICKS AND THEY RARELY LET NEW PEOPLE IN OR OUT. I USED TO TRY AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH THESE ASSHOLES AND THEY ALL BURNED ME, ALL THE THREE YEARS I HAVE BEEN VENTURING IN FIGHT ROOMS THEY STILL CALL ME RETARDED. I GUESS SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE, BUT IF THEY WANT TO BE LIKE THAT THEN FUCK 'EM-TO HELL WITH THEM. IT'S REALLY KINDA FUNNY, ALL THIS TIME BY BLOG HAS BEEN UP NOT A SINGLE SOUL HAS LEFT A COMMENT-YOU GUYS ARE NO FUN.
