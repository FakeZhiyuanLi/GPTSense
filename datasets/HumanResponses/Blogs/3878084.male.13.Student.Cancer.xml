       Hey today was fun. I went to the Rapidz with Toniann, Eileen, Kimmy, Andrew, and Jessika. The only bad part is that we ran into juss gues???¿¿¿ jordan OG. Well the day went like this.   Andrew, Jessika, Kimmy got dropped off at 9 by kimmys mom. Then we went and picked up Eileen, and Toniann in Nautica. Then we all went to the rapidz. We got their around 10:30 and we went on all the slides. In the lazy river we all wrestled. LOl andrew kept getting hurt by me toniann and eileen. Yeh then we came home around 4 and swam in my pool for like and hour. Then kimmy and jessika came over. And andrew went home. Then we all played basketball. Then every1 had to go.  But i stayed home and went to run at about 6:30. Then came home and got ready to go to Red Lobster and then we came home around 10:30. Then i got ready for bed and was pissed off at jordan and went to sleep. And now jordan is lying... Long story tell ya later. Peace Out Christian

      Hey.  2day was not my average day.  U will probaly think i have mental issues or sumthing bcuz i woke up at 8:00 on my own free will.  U wanna knoe why keep reading if u do.  The reason is, bcuz Andrew told me about wat he was doing so i went to the jcc to b a chaperone for the lil kidz.  The thing is these kids R 2,3,4 years old.  So u can already guess that they r annoying and i thought that it was probaly goin to b He||.  But it wasnt. But the thing is when i left alot of them started to cry so i didnt knoe wat to do so i told that i would b bac on monday so they all quit crying thats why i am gonna do it for the rest of da summer. Plus their not that bad i knoe wat am i saying, and no i did not convert over to jewish to go there.  I juss had to tell u that.  Ceasar got a bath today.  Like u care. Well we went to Harry potter 3 then we went to eat at Brews Room.  Then we went to walk on the beach which i dont knoe why.  Last I am talking online later.                 Peace ChrisB
