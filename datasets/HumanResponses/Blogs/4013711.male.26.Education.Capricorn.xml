       "I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him."  -John Kerry on ABC News  Well JK, this is really interesting.  You looked at the intelligence, and made the same inference that the President did?  Anyone who says that Bush "lied" or "misled" this country for personal gain is simply exaggerating for political gain.  The last time a President did not act (not only Clinton, but Bush too) three thousand people died catastrophically.  If there is a risk to the U.S., and this was confirmed by MI6, Russians, and the U.N.; to not act would be criminal.  I agree that the war was unjustified, and that there may have been other tertiary motives.  However, to say that President Bush intentionally fought this war for oil or some conspiracy theory is out there.  Not one naysayer has been able to prove that the President had done this for personal gain.  See Bob Woodward's book; he doesn't take the president off the hook, but he does say that the intel was on the side of attacking.  Bob is non-partisan, and he did take down Nixon, so he has no problem taking on the republicans.  If anyone tells me that my wife is safer going to work, or that my young cousins are safer going to school because we obliterated a brutal regime, I would say good.  In the world of post 9/11, there is NO margin for error.  The primary job of the President is to protect the country.  When the 9/11 commission shows verivied intel that al-Zarqawi (the murderer who enjoys decapitation) was getting free services from Sadaam, that is a red flag.  When the Iraqi government stonewalls the U.N. and U.S. inspectors sent to investigate WMD's. that is a flag too.  But most of all, when Hans Blix left the country prematurely due to lack of cooperation, do we as a world nation just say - ok, you may carry on how you like?  The precedent has been set, America does what it says, and Hussein's flagrant violations of UN  resolutions and his own peace accord should have warranted immediate action.  Coming soon - my position on France!  Looking forward to commentary on this one, the bait has been set!

       Karl was in town last night ad it was great to see him.  Having Jay, Kyle, Karl, and myself get together was like old times, and a whole lot of fun.  Even though it was like old times, it really was like new times.  All of our life situations are so "adult" now.  Whether we talk about marriage, homeownership, or our jobs, it always seems to be the things my parents used to talk about when I was little.  But this is a good thing we all know.  Each chapter of life presents a new and exciting challenge and goal for us to accomplish.  As long as we head in a direction of some sort, we will do well.  And almost all of the original crew have done well.  Nothing is perfect, but manhood looks good on all of the original bunch of idiots who chose to hang out together over ten years ago.  What is next for this intrepid bunch?  We'll chat...

       I thought that only people wore masks.  I am surprised to see that organizations do too.  I was pleased with the change in tone from the Democratic Party, but I ask this; where was this a few weeks ago?  The Kerry campaign is without substance.  He puts forward no comprehensive view, no solutions to the problems he outlines.  Now we know that the election is really a referendum on The President, but still, what can you possibly support?  He tells us that he "would have" or the U.S. "should have."  How?  Can you say that you would have built a coalition with the corrupt French government?  The Germans would have send their thirty footsoldiers to fallujah?  So we'll see what plan he outlines.  Not one vote has been earned yet - it is simply disapproval of the current situation.  The question is, who will listen?  The ideologes on either side?  Independents aren't even paying attention, it is all gut reaction.  George, the ball is in your court.  A mask will only obfuscate your shot.

       I find it hard to like someone I disagree with so much; yet that is the case with Nader.  I saw an interview with him, and I find him to be straightforward, upfront, and logical.  I disagree with most of his positions, but there are a few that I must admit are valid.  The only one I agree with totally; electoral reform.  I think that both parties have done poorly for America.  They only have to run against each other, and it is always a two way choice.  What about others who don't fit into this agenda?  Arnold Schwarzenegger does NOT fit the republican mold due to his position on social issues.  How does he fit into the overall mold?  Should he choose his party on economic issues only?  This makes little sense to me.  The governor of Calfornia belongs to a political party that disagrees with him on many issues.  How about the voter?  I find it hard to believe that 93% of African-Americans that did vote, voted for Gore in the last presidential election.  Why?  Because the republicans have a racist record.  This may be the case, yet most Aftican-Americans are religious and do agree with many conservatives!  Entitlements have apparently not worked, and activists such as Cosby and Lee are attesting to this.  The Democrats are completely oblivious to their wants and now the republicans are too.  In ten years they will be completely disenfranchised.  Where is their party?  And for the average joe, how can they be a part of the process?  It is terribly difficult to compete when nepotism and money are bloating both parties.  Populism doesn't exist, because it is impossible to break in in a grass-roots effort without the blessing of the party chiefs.  This again alienates when we should should try to encompass.  So Ralph, you are wrong on most issues, but I respect you.  You believe in what you say, and it is for the people that you do it.  Keep getting your message out, for you are expressing what our forefathers envisioned.

       Well, here it is.  I think I will give this a spin.  This is not my first attempt at it, but I feel that this site will give me many options to enjoy the process greatly.  Feel free to comment, and that is what I am doing right now!

       I went to a wedding last night that was for someone I didn't even know.  It was poorly executed, poorly planned, and even moreso; it was tacky.  It was a "traditional" italian wedding, but it really wasn't.  They played music that was popular in the 50's in Italy, not things that were popular now.  So it begs the question, what is it to be Italian in America?  I find that being italian somewhat myself, this question is of some importance to me.  Italian-Americans try to identify themselves with an Italy of yore.  The Italy that actually existed while their grandparents or great grandparents experienced.  How long can this nostalgia last?  Italy has evolved well beyond the days of Al Martino's crooning or Louis Prima's frenetic lyrics.  This simply becomes a caricature of what really is Italian.  I think those who have real knowledge of their italian heritage would be repulsed by this.  It is insulting to them to think that their culture is one that never progressed, and grew a culture of mobsters and scumbags.  This stereotype must end, and only will when Italian-Americans stop perpetuating it.

       It really is wonderful to be outside.  I think that something is changing in the hardware of the American making the inside lifestyle the way most people live their lives.  Work, play, and rest all take place in a safe and sterile environment.  This is understandable, this is easier in a culture that demands ease.  But what of the repercussions?  There is little to demonstrate just what effect this will have upon us.  It made me fat and out of shape, a mere shadow of the lean powerhouse I once was.  How many others fall into this trap?  There was a man who was over 1,000 lbs. brought to a Nebraska hospital.  I don't think he was being all that primal.  Were our parents exposed to this type of situation?  I can't tell.  But somewhere, someone is living the caveman life.  I just wish it was me.

       I am off to raft the wilds of Maine's penobscot.  It really is a great experence, and you can pack so minimally, it is easy to do.  The price is right, and the scenery is the best.  The outdoors are becoming a scarce commodity, and it is wonderful that we have the opportunity to enjoy them.

       It has been a while, but I am replaying Metroid Prime.  This game is just great.  There are few titles that I can say are "addictive," but this is one of them.  Retro studios really outdid themselves.  I hope that all of you get a chance to play it, for it truly is high quality.
