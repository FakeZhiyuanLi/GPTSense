      We have a few days left in Japan before flying to Germany. To round off our trip here we are taking the train to Hakone tomorrow to catch a glimpse (hopefully) of Fuji San.  Jess's boyfriend, Ben, returned from his work trip the other day and since then we have had much more of the local beer and seen some interesting nightscapes. Ben is fluent in English, Japanese and American.  Prior to Ben's return, Louise and I were using "pigeon-nippongo" to get by, which apart from being frightfully funny, is completely unhelpful. A request for a ticket from Yogi Bear station (Yoyogi) to Dog-on-a-tuckerbox (Takadabobaba) would be met with a long-winded, rehearsed and passionate account of Japan's imperial history, with particular emphasis on the nasty invading hordes, who they called "gaijin" and who they clearly did not care for much.  Apart from the ticket guy, everyone here has been incredibly friendly and considerate. I personally love this place, life here is so different to Australia - however - from what I have seen, Japanese people tend to spend much more of their time existing than living. There are so many places where it is not socially acceptable to talk (like trains, small retaurants or any confined spaces), and their culture and code of conduct seems so strict that quirky features have popped up (like all-age comic book reading, rebellious fashion, and popular fetishism).  Having said that, we are yet to meet a young Japanese person who is not cool. They all seem to spend so much money on their clothes and haircuts, it has put Louise and me to shame.  After I finish this blog, we are going to the world's largest fish market near Ginza. We have been warned to wear old shoes. The Tokyo Lonely Planet reports that some tuna fish fetch 2 million yen each (nearly 13 thousand AUD)! I will settle for just a slice at the local Sushi Train, thank you.  Until next time, please feel free to post your comments! Love to all.

      We are in Tokyo (Iogi actually) staying with our great friend Jessica Smith.  It was blisteringly hot yesterday. We only managed to walk for 15 minutes to the train station before suffering from heat exhaustion and deciding it was too much effort to actually board a train. We took refuge in a supermarket instead where it was cool and browsed the isles looking at all the different types of local food. It was great fun and we spent nearly 2 hours at it!  We have spent some considerable time sampling the local beer from the comfort of Jess`s massage chair and hope to get out and about in the next couple of days.  We have no access to the mobile phone network here. Sorry if you were awaiting a response to a message you have left us...

      There must be a beginning - and there must be an end. This is the order of things.  Let me start at the start, skip ten billion years, and take you to the present day...  Melbourne CBD, morning. 13 degrees and overcast. Level 10, recently renovated residential block annexed to the soaring green-topped IOOF Building. Apartment 1007 â€“ our home for the past 18 months. Sitting at the dining room table, facing north.  I have been "released from my retainer". Current position: man of leisure (and mystery).  Weisie has charged me with the responsibility of undertaking some important administrative tasks necessary for our Big Trip. She is half way through her last day of work, and thinks I am conscientiously completing the list of tasks she has left behind for me. Silly of her really.  [Weisie, if you are reading this, the previous paragraph was inserted to give our opening Blog some pizzazz, or as they say in Sydney, "zhuz"].  Welcome to Weisie's World. Enjoy the trip.
