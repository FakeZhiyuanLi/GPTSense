         9:23 AM:  Yay, another physical...now I can figure out my new status (you know, weight, height, etc.). There ARE some parts of a physical that bother me (when they get down to the personal parts; you know what I mean), but I'll live. After that, I'm home for the rest of the day.  Next week is week 4 of 5 at White Stadium, which I plan to go to (since I need my last 6 hours anyway, and I have nothing better to do). After the 5th week, it's vacation for me. No, I'm not all excited for it, but I'm not running away at the sight of it either. We'll see how it works out.   Edit @ 12:37 PM:  I haven't gained much weight over the past year, and if anything, I only grew an inch taller. Also, I seemed to have had wheezing problems when I was

       I've made a blogger weblog, as you can clearly see here. I still have my xanga up, and I don't know...these two services offer different perks. I think I should keep this for a while and see how it goes..maybe I'll like it.  Anyone can comment now; you don't have to be a registered user. I could also make this blog my homepage :-)  We shall see in the near future...  Well, also, rain (from earlier) kept me home today (no program). I'm not going tomorrow either (doctor appointment), so that really sucks. Two full days of community service (for school), five days home. I don't seem to like free time anymore...

       Well, a friend I know that lives in New York (gaming group, all internet, don't ask) wanted me to promote her artwork, so  urlLink here's the link to it .  I had a  very good  day with my community service over at White Stadium. Less kids, less whiners, less arguments. Worked well for all of us. Went to Ruggerio's (Italian resturant), but I didn't eat anything there; I'm staying away from food like that for a while. But I did buy a "Big Burst"....hell yeah :-p  Had a few nice tennis games, practiced with my colleague (I HAVE to get as good as him...it's my destiny! [not really] ). There's one very good camper that's with us, who has better swings than me; it's just that he can't get his big self across the field. He has the potential...he's like Mario Tennis's Wario. :-)  My tennis skills aren't up to par. I have the speed. I have some swings down. I need to keep myself from jumping (I jump on volley hits all the time), I need to continue practicing my serve, and I have to be able to receive faster hits. My backhands are usually better than my forehands. I can scurry quickly to a ball too, so I think I'm a pretty decent player at the moment. We'll see how it works out.  60 hours comes after tomorrow. I'm not going on Friday. There's two weeks before my cruise; those are optional weeks. I probably will return, even with the weirdo kids there.
