      My dog was one of the best dogs in the world! Best breed, best attitude, best everything! I had my dog since I was three. And I would always play with him! I loved my dog so much! I remember that when my dad gave me my dog for my birthday I was crying because that my dad was running late in picking me up from nursery. When he picked me up I noticed that there was a box with holes and it was moving.    When we got home my dad was singing the happy birthday song and brought in a cute dog! I was so happy! I named him timon from the lion king! I loved the dog so much! he was such a good dog to me! everytime I would come home from school he would run towards me and lick my leg! It would tickle a bit but I didn't care! hee hee hee! Then one saturday morning I went down to watch spongebob squarepants! Then my mom entered the room with red eyes and she told me that my dog died. I cried and cried when I herd the news. I guess he had to die pretty soon since he was 10 human years old. I miss my dog. Alot. :(

      Today I went to the Saturday market. It was crowded. I biked there with my sister. I bought a lot of food. As I went home my bike started to screw up! The back wheel did not wanna move! I forced a big push then I herd a snap! I looked in the other side to check and the chain was dangling! My bike is broken! What can I do? Boo hoo! My dad said that he will bring my bike anyway to the store that I bought it in to fix it. I have a 6 month warranty. After biking I took a long shower and ate lunch. Then I passed out on my moms bed! I was so sleepy! When I woke up I watched "the Royal Tenenbaums". I liked it! It is now considered as my favorite movie. The movie ended at around 4:30. Just in time for my favorite show "That so Raven"! So I just watched T.V. the whole day. I was a bum! I was so tired from my morning work out! Whew! Anywayzzzzzzzzz... I have to go now. I am gonna watch Saturday Night live with my mom. Babye.

      today I had school! It was an "ok" kind of day! I had a hard time waking up in the morning cause I watched the cat in the hat last night and I stayed up late! Its took me 20 whole minutes to get up! My mom had her "excercise" so I had to dress up extra early! I ate really fast! I had a full glass of milk and a cheese omlette! The omlette was so frikin good! I loved it! it was made of artificial cheese! Hee hee hee! I knowit sounds cheap! Hee hee hee! Today we had the opening of our "clubs" and I had to present something for the theater club. And I was making everyone laugh! (surprisingly!) Then now I am about to watch cat in the hat again in the computer! So Bye!

      I am so bored I could really do something right now! Maybe go biking, but i can't because it is too sunny! I don'y understand why we don't have classes if the weather is very sunny! I wish I had alot of stuff to do like what I said in my other blog. I wish I could go to the mall and have unlimited shopping money! Boo hoo! I wanna go to more parties! Before everyone would invite me to their parties on the same time so I couldn't really go to all! It's just that now there are no more parties to attend! I love parties! And yet I am not attending one now. To keep myself entertained I go online and chat with friends. I also like to write alot of blogs when I am bored! By the end of this day this "when I am bored" folder will have alot of blogs! Hehehehehehe! I only started "blogging" now and I am already posting alot of stuff. Hehehehehehehe!

I wanna get a new pet to play with but my dad won't get me one! Boo hoo! I wish I was old enough to drink alcohol and drive! I could have fun that way! I don't know what the deal is with drinking! But being tipsy looks fun! I wanna try to drink! My dad allows me to drink only sips from his cup of wine! It tastes so good! But The next sip tasted awful! I drank a bit too much in my sip and it was bitter! Blah! I remember that I came home from school one day and my dad had a nice glass of of water! I didn't know why it was so small! But I drank all of it anyway cause I was so thirsty! OH MY GOD! That tasted nasty! It was vodka! Yuck! Blah!
