      thanks to a comment on my blog by  urlLink lynus  i have found another great site... the price is a little high... but my goals are as well! some of the stuff on this page is really really neat.. i'm at work right now so i will do my best to get all my interest up.  urlLink     "The ProScope is a handheld USB microscope that allows you to display and capture microscopic images with your computer."     i really would like to know how this works... A pen that remembers what you right! i bet the government is having a ball with this idea! think about it if a pen can copy what you write the have a portable device to up load it to you pc.. were you don't need the usb cord... but i'm no government i guess i'll have to do it with the cord... i really don't want to own this i just want to try it! very need idea for people with no brain cells left!

      well good day to you.. i'm on my lunch brake eating my favorite food item from taco bell those cheesy patatos.. yummy oh and drinking my red bull... boy last night at work was fun! i get in there and mike is there all ready half crocked... you know i like mike i just wish he didn't drink! the same goes for will. i wish they didn't drink! it's okay to drink even 1 time a week.. but all the freakn time! all that shows me is they have no passion for life! no goals just drinking goals and that it controls them... i guess i have my ex to thank for that... but he was just a drunk! but anyway we didn't get that busy last night but there were a table full of chicks that danced and my boss was there so that made me look soo good.... i even got to give a shot special....  so i get home and go to bed... i'm guessing 4 hours is enough sleep cuz i'm not really that tired. i will be tho.. i still might go home and sleep for a while! i guess i never get enough sleep concidering i like to sleep 8-10 hours a nite! well i'm going to finish eating instead of bloggeling! good day!!!

       urlLink    this is a great idea. it is not forever on your car like a bumper sticker! just hope you have metal bumplers or have a backing for plastic cars.  i think if you can make them coustom it would be better. i guess i like the little dragonflys but i would rather make somehting cooler like flames or dice or something that is not an animal. i will have to look into magnetic tattoos some more find differnt styles and ideas...
