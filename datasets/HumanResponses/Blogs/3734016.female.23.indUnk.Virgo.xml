         Hi, Yesterday I went to go see  The Notebook &nbsp;and it was an awesome movie.&nbsp;I didn't cry because&nbsp;I cried over the book and I usually don't cry over things&nbsp;twice. I went to go see it with Justine we had lots of fun there were these two gay guys sitting right in front of&nbsp;us and we kept laughing.&nbsp; The guy kept looking at us mean. HAHAHAHA That was the quietest movie that I ever walked out of because every&nbsp;one was crying. When i got home&nbsp;I had to read thye book AGAIN because it was really good. Then ramsay and Jake got back from  Anchorman &nbsp;and I don't know why they went and saw that cuz that movie&nbsp;was horrible. Then I talked to them and they were wierd like always but i still love ramsay and Jake is really funny. Then ramsay went&nbsp; to bed and Jake was like&nbsp;Can you believe that Hannah&nbsp;he fell asleep on me and I was like I can't believe it. Then&nbsp;I went to sleep&nbsp;because I was bored and&nbsp;I dreamed of somethin really wierd. I was at this NAshville Christian&nbsp;party and everyone from my old class was there and&nbsp;Virginia and Ramsay and Macaulay were there then i was like HEY Melvin and he gave me this Big hug andd I said your not Ramsay then he said Ramsay went trick or treating with me and I was like ok?. Then&nbsp;all the guys had to do somethin with this potion thing&nbsp;and if they picked the wrong one somethin bad could happen to them it was really wierd then I woke up. And so that's how I'm&nbsp;right here telling you this.    &nbsp;  BYE BYE&nbsp;    &nbsp;  HaNnAh&nbsp;&nbsp;
