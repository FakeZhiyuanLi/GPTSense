      *Yerf Having lots of fun on the Texas trip... So far he hasn't done a whole lot, but he sounds kinda eager to hear over to the mall. He called me around 12:30 today (this is Stef..), and explained some of the interesting things that happened. ^.^ On the flight over there, he was waiting for his mom, and was standing next to a stewardess, wearing his collar, bandana, and sunglesses. 'She looked like she thought I was going to mug her, and asked me nervously to wait somewhere else.' (You need to hear the way he described it to find that as funny as I did ^.^;) So yeah... I'll be typing in here for Kit over the next few days ^.^ (Not exactly the same from me, but *Warm wuff hugs*)

      (Started at 11:00PM Tuesday) (*yerf) It me...who else would it be well stuck here infront of my computer writting in this blog again.... Only one day and I leave to Texas..(*Tear) 10 days without computer... So spent the day with my dumbass friends and Chris is staying over..He's eating popcorn infront of me right now... But, Oh-kay I'll put my whole 50 page (well not that much) journey:  Day 1 Sunday: Ted and I went to the beach. Waves where at least 5 feet high it was awesome! Then it started raining so his ma picked us up. Went over to ted's for a while played games and stuff then stef came over. We watched an episode of outlaw star that was never realeased in the USA cause it had to much porn and hentai in it to bleep out. That was cool to all hang out and stuff.  Day 2 Monday: Phone Rings, "Hello?" I pick up. "Hey, Adan." Its Ted of course. "Yeah, what do you want?" I say. "Get you ass over here." Look at my clock. "Dude its already 4:30."  "So!" "How would I get a ride"... Lucky enough I got a ride on the On-Tran and stayed at Chris's house (A friend). Oh-kay we went swimming at the beach for a while. Then went to ted's house. All the way they had rollerblades I had to walk, (*cheers)! Well got at ted's played PS2 and such then went to chris's and met his dad. He's pretty cool so then we finally at 12:00mid went upstairs and played some music, drew, watch tv and then finally went outside for a smoke (not cigarrets those are bad for you! Just plain cherry tasteing menthol cigars. Something personally I had'nt done in a long time. So, we went out to the rooof and had a smoke. I dunno what happened to me just felt felly or something and sat therere looking at the sky (something I do at home alot to avoid contact from my parents). So after that done we where planning to raid the town till chris practically passed out into a sleep. So guess the raid of senseless destruction could'nt go on. Maybe another night.   Day 3 Tuesday Next day I woke up at 6am kicked chris two times in the side and he did'nt wake up so went down stairs. His dad left to work so I tried to make myself 'at home' as much as I could. Ate waffles drank tea and watched MTV singing loudly to Pink and Incubus. Finally he woke up at like 11:00 we had a smoke (*Those small cigars) and watched TV. Then we decided to rollerblade down to ted's and get a pizza from the holiday gas station while on our way. But, before we did that chris made this stuff called 'Chuck' its like a mix of gasoline, antifreeze and flour. It does'nt explode or anything but it burns for a long time (great for making a bon fire). Got to ted's ate pizza on the way acted stupid then, went swimming at the beach. We fought and wreastled on the beach till we got tired made a fire and got warm. Rollerbladed back to ted's after like 4 hours or so. I hurt my paw on the way by crashing into a sewrcap I did'nt see(*Crash into me-Dave Matthews Band). So went back to ted's. Chris wanted to stay at my place so I said, "Sure." My mom picked us up and we went to my place. But, for some reason (just don't take this the wrong way) my testicle hurt I'm all like "Shit, my right nut hurts, Chris!"  He's like "Oh-kay" So he said we should jump in my pool for a while maybe help the keep sweling down or something I dunno. So I got my trunks on and the oddest thing happend I moved my right nut and it like popped back into place!?! How can you pop a nut back into place??? Well, whatever happend my nut felt better and that ain't not bad. So went in the pool then showed him a few flips and stuff on the trampoline (he totally sucked but oh-well). Then we decided to call my friend in houghton and we talked with her for a while then went online. Got directions how to make Napalm but we did'nt have the supplies needed. So, not bombs or stuff to make....Oh-Well   Day 4 Wendsday So leave tommorrow so that not so cool. Leave at like 8AM in the morning. So I woke up chris at 10:05 then called On-Tran (Bus Station) to pick up chris cause he had to go to work and 4H meeting (Help Honor something something). Well, so we watched tv for a while that one music video called "the red" or something is cool cause everyone is like kicking the crap out of eachother then a few seconds after the music the girl comes on and like claps her hands and says "thats good". Guess you have to see it to understand. Then we watched Ricki Lake on Fox (Quality progamming, there J/K). It was like a bunch of fat people and stuff. But, there was one guy named Big Mark and he was huge in wait but he did'nt care and he was going out with this hot chick. Really really hott I mean like a super model. Then it was so sweet he proposed to her a few later and she accepted His words where when Ricki asked when is the wedding going to be?  He said, "In summer cause I like it hot. and it will get really hot afterwords you know what I'm saying Ricki. Bang Bang Bang!" Chris cracked up after that. Then On-Tran came and he had to leave for work and stuff (*bye bye, Cwis). (Personal Reminder Chris's shorts and 2 pairs over rollerblades of his I have to return and he has my boots.) So now stuck here back at my computer packing my suitcase, backpack and carry on. Trying to make contact with friends as much as I can before I leave..(*tear, sniff)   So I dunno what to do have to have my friends check my email and stuff if I can't get online down there. Hey anyone know any furs in Texas while I'm down there? So, I'll try to stay in contact some way be gone for 10 days!

      (*Yerf, Sigh) Not much is going to today its looking pretty boring so far. I mean really boring. So, I decided to catch up in my reading. I'm reading a book that will hopefully help me in drawing. Its a revised copy of the book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain By Betty Edwards. Its teaching me alot and also has little tutorials to help you along even though the materials are hard to find. It also contains theorys and stuff about the how the brain handles visual infromation. Its a nice book among my collection of drawing books. But, I recommend it even though I have'nt read the whole thing, yet. So looks like a pretty boring day...I dunno what to say..I'm bored though.

      (*Yerf) Oh-Kay at least some stuff happened today. Went over to a friend's house for a few hours. We went to the beach for about an hour then it started to rain so we went back to his house. Got bored played some PC games. Oni, and Unreal Tournament Game of the Year Edition (My Favorite Games!). then after 'bout another hour watched some T.V. and called a friend over and we played some Armored Core on my friends PS2. I totally suck at it but, hey I'm a PC gamer not a console gamer...That was practically my whole day but, it was fun. Now, I'm stuck here once again at my computer writting Perl scripts for my website. Can't wait to get my site online... It's going to be great! Until next time!

      (*yerf) Just got off work..and ugh my little paws hurt! Today was a fun-filled work day I came across so much weird stuff you won't believe. Ok first of all I get to work I punch in at 4:23 (my shift is 5:00, I'm always early) I go out to look at the dining room. Cool, only one table of two out there so far. Well anyway I get my stuff already (Such as my silverware, placemats, ect. I buss tables so..) then I overhear Jackie (The Head Waitress, or as we call her the MEGA-BITCH.) talking to my mom Karina (Hostess) that we have over a hundred reservations for tables (Oh, Shit). I was the only busser working friday. Then I ran into my old 6th elementary spanish teacher, it took me a while to recognize her. So that was pretty cool. Can't beleive she remebered me! Well, anyway the next thing that happens is three people walk in. Pretty normal till I notice one guy was wearing an Anthrocon Tee Shirt! It blew my mind a Furry in the restaurant I worked at. So, while I bussing a table right next to them I kinda talked to the guy. I kinda started by saying  "Cool, so you where at anthrocon?"  "Yea" he says "So...I..I don't mean to be rude or anything, Sir. But are you a..a furry?" Why did I call him sir? "Yea" he says with a grin. I think his buddies that where with him did'nt know what was going on. "So am I." I said "Cool you just got into it or what?" He said "I've been a furry for a while." I said "Oh well I'm Jim." He said holding out his hand. "Ok, I'm Kit Wolf...well um *chuckle* my furry name is Kit Wolf. My real name is Adan." I said shaking his hand. "Cute name." He said. (*Blush, O..kay..) I finshed bussing my table and he saw I had to get back to work. "So..Kit" he said. "Yea?" (*Blush) "Maybe I'll see you at a convention some time?" I smiled, "Maybe, but ..do..you live around here?" "No," He said ,"Visiting family and I wanted to go to Anthrocon too...I live in California." "Wow, you came all this way?" "Yea" "Well see you round, maybe." "See ya, Kit." Wow I actually meet another fur...at my own workplace! Did he call my name cute? Well, I did'nt mind the complement but, he was like twenty-five or so and from California (Furry Central!!!). Well, anyway I thought that was extremly cool. But, The night was'nt over just yet! So, I was back at work then an hour passed or so. Probably only fifty or so people left maybe thirty tables not too bad. Then finally the racoon then a while later the bear actually came to eat (in our restaurant we feed this big black bear all the scraps from the table, it had'nt been coming around for at least a week. But, it finally did!). So that was kinda of a different furry encounter I had. Ok, so back to work...finished the last table (thank God!) I punch out at 10:40 and met my mom in the bar (Chatting with her friends as usual.) So I got a 7UP (I usally don't drink 7UP but I was seriously on my feet all day, needed something to unwind. 100 reservations. 1 busser. They need to hire more people). I sat down eating a few shrimp I had snatched off the hotfood buffet and drank my 7UP Mitch, the hotfood filler sat next to me and we talked for a while then the dishwasher came and sat down we talked some more. (I don't know the dishwasher's name, exactly. But he's cool. He says I work a hell of alot more than Mitch and its true. Mitch is always bumming around and I had to tell him a few times to fill the buffet cause people where getting pissed. The dishwasher guy is cool though. Calls me his little buddy 'cause I helped him out of a few jams. His car broke and of course i had to work aa dishwasher and busser for half the night. Of course the guy is a good worker though. Not like Mitch. Mitch is always bitching about how crappy the pay is, or that we have to many people. He's sitting on his ass half the time so I don't see what he is so worried about how many people we have. Well, whatever just ticks me off, is all.) So, After the three of us talked they finally left. I was still waiting for my mom.  There was also a band playing in the bar so I stayed and listened to them for a while. Then my mom finally stopped talking and we went out to the car. (Yes, home, bed...I was a pretty tired, sore, and aching 'lil wuff by the time we got home). Well, got home went to my house (Yes, I live in my own house. Bedroom, living room, bathroom, the whole works). First thing I do is peel off my sweaty, fish smelling work clothes and take a shower (Ah, heaven).  So, put on some warm clothes went to the computer room and curled up in my computer chair with my fleece blanket and decided to write in my blog. Which of course I'm doing now. I'm just glad I don't have to work at all next week 'cause I'll be gone visting my sister.  Oh and before I forget get this. Bussers get 10% of what waitresess make on tips. Jackie set my money I made for the night on the counter in the kitchen...and get this I forgot it!!!! There was at least $30 just from the waitresses for me! Just hope someone does'nt take it! I fell so stupid. Well, easy come easy go. I'm still getting a paycheck in the mail anyway...  (*wags tail) So until next time I blog or.....next time something interesting happens.

      (*yerf) Me again.  Who else would I be? Ok just making a quick blog entry before I fall asleep at my computer, again. Probably end up till 3 or 5AM again making .html pages for my site. Its going to be the tyghtest .com site on the net. With Furries/and Anime, KEWL! I guess I should pump another gallon of pepsi in me. Already drank about a half case so far of Pepsi (Personal Note: Best drink on earth! Next to Coca-Cola!)  Ugh! I got to stay awake. I just went through a long chat with 3 other of my friends on AIM. Lets just say we end up dissing eachother for like the whole session. It was cool having all my friends in one place at one time. Wish I had them all together in person though. Can't wait till I get my drivers license. Drive out of this hell hole! Well, its not much of a hell hole just my parents get on my nerves and I find myslef stuck in from of the computer all day or sitting my ass on the lawnmower listening to J-Rock and Metal on my MP3 player. I dunno I guess for some people how they have a place they can relax. I guess the lawnmower is where I think the best I can just sit there turn it on and zone out, once in a while empting the grass bag.  But, anyway I found a cool song on the net. I got bored typed in fox and on kazza popped up a song by a band I never heard before the song is kinda cool. Kinda like a campsong I'm into heavy metal though like type o negative but downloaded it and added it to my music match playlist.   The Fox by Nickle Creek The fox ran out on a chilly night He pray for the moon to give him light For he had many a mile to go that night Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o He had many a mile to go that night Before he reached the town-o  He ran 'till he came to the farmer's pen The ducks and the geese were kept therein He said, "A couple of you are gonna grease my chin, Before I leave this town-o, town-o, town-o, A couple of you are gonna grease my chin, Before I leave this town-o."  He grabbed the gray goose by the neck He threw a duck across his back And he didn't mind the quack, quack And the legs all dangling down-o, down-o, down-o He didn't mind the quack, quack And the legs all dangling down-o  Well the old gray woman jumped out of bed Out of the window she popped her head Crying John, John, the gray goose is gone The fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o John, John, the gray goose is gone And the fox is on the town-o  He ran 'til he came to his nice warm den And there were the little ones, 8,9, 10 Sayin' Daddy, Daddy, better go back again It must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o, Daddy, Daddy go back again For it must be a mighty fine town-o  The fox and his wife, without any strife They cut up the goose with a fork and a knife And they'd never had such a supper in their life And the little ones chewed on the bones-o, bones-o, bones-o And they never had such a supper in their life And the little ones chewed on the bones   Its a good song guess since i'm a furry it appeals to me more! ^.^ Well not much else has happened today so until next time I type....

      I back writing in this blog again. Have to admit this is getting addictive...  Not much happend so far today. Almost killed myself getting ahead on entering stories in my computer and getting ahead on html page in 1st Page 2000. Lets see. I went to sleep at probably 3:00am and got up at 12:00 noon. So I mostly missed half of the day already. Took a shower (You could guess how sweaty and smelly you get locked in a computer room with no air conditioner). But, I survived. Went outside to clean to pool while listening to Papa Roach. Now I'm stuck back here in the computer with my brief encounter of being outside cleaning the pool. WOW, my life is boring... Well I gotta hurry to get my .com site up. Work on html pages and make a kick ass site I'll mention the URL in this blog when its up. Until next time I blog...

      (*Yerf) I dunno if this blogging stuff actually works. Here goes nothing. Ok, a little about myslef I live in Upper Michigan. I enjoy writing stories, updating websites, art, I'm a HUGE Anime Fan, and I'm also furry (A cub wolf named Kit Wolf *Grrr).  For thouse of you who don't care what a furry is, OK. But for those of you who would like to know go to google.com (Personal Note: Best search engine, EVER!) and search for 'furry'. Who knows you could be a furry and not even know it ^.^' Well, anyway something interesting happend to me. I was searching in the storage room of my house and came across my old stuff from first grade. It was a story I had written. I had IM'ed it to my friend and she said typed back quote/unquote "lol..aw cute ^.^'" But that is a woman's opinion in the first place. Well here it is the story I had written in first grade:  My Awful Day        (I'm really pestimistic, OK?) Andre's alarm clock goes off. I fell off my bed. I got dressed and brushed my teeth. Then my dog jumps all over me. I'm all full of fur. Then I missed the bus, so we went in Jacob's car. I got to chool late. I had to hurry up and so my work. I think I'll move to Japan (Personal Note: It was always a dream of mine to move to japan and be a hotdog vendor, but that was only my cover-up 'cause I was actually a secret agent) At lunch we had tator tots and white milk. I don't like tator tots and white milk. During recess I was running and I tripped in a big hole. Then after recess we had to do more work and then the teacher said we had to go home on the bus. I was squished on the ride home. I think I'll move to Japan. Then at my stop, i tripped as I got off the bus and went home. I went to ride my bike. I fell of my bike and the bike fell on top of me. Then my mom says it was time for supper. We had meat loaf. I hate meat loaf. After supper I got in bed. Then I fell off my bed again. I got a big cut on my head. It hurt reallyb bad. Then my mom came in my room and she put peroxide on it. Then I went back to bed.                      THE END Not my best story I had ever written but, it was 1rst grade. I just think its funny in my mind how after reading that how much you grow up or change. But, not all things change. Yes, I still hate meat loaf. But, I have came to like things like tator tots and I drink milk almost by the gallon and I still want to move far away (Personal Note: or to place that is'nt driving distance from my parents). Anyway most of all I still want to move to Japan. Sometimes some people's "Dreams" change like my stepdad's. His dream was to be an world famous artist but instead he now works at the REA.          Only, one thing is for sure.....                                            My "Dream" will never change....I want to move to Japan and be a game designer......                                                                     My Dream

      *yerf* It me the Cubby Wolf known as Kit! I sowy I was really neglecting my blog lately. *huggies* Sowy Blog. But, anyways I work again tonight with my favorite dishwashe (*Personal Note: Try to remeber that guy's name.) Also, there was a band playing at the restaurant (There called Junction 28). Its kinda of a local band. I did'nt stay to watch I mean after you work for 5 hours straight you just want to get the H E Double Hockysticks out of there. So, I got home and greeted by my grandparents. (They're staying the weekend, more good new I guess!) But don't get me wrong I love my grandparents its just that you know.... I'm so excited though cause I'm having a get-together with a couple of friends (If they can make it!) Where all going to meet for the frist time stef's cousin. We chatted with him a few times, I think he's cool. But, sometimes people are so different offline...Like me for example *giggles* But I can't wait to meet Dan...I plan to kick is butt at Perfect Dark (*My favorite shooter of all time!) and where going to play on the trampoline and go swimming in the pool stuff like that. But first we'll hang around town cause he wants to see some people he met online like one of my friends Rach. Also we plan to talk to fangkit (A BabyFur friend of mine.) Speaking of FangKit. He kinda sounded down in the dumps. He was really depressed cause people wer'ent apreciating his art. He triend getting some art posted on Karis Playground (*Contains Infatalism/BabyFur Material*   www.karisplayground.com) Karis posted other artists art such as Gore, and Marci McAdams but refused FangKit's for some reason, I dunno what she said exactly to FangKit but I'll ask him. I dunno I don't think FangKit's art is bad , actually I think its the best BabyFur art around cause its 'cleaner' than most BabyFur art. You be the judge though FangKit's art can be found at www.foxnip.com He even said he'd quit doing art because the BabyFur community did'nt like his artwork anymore. But I don't think its true.....I know a few furs and people around my neighborhood that absoultly love his art. But I chatted with him for a while and talked him out of it! He said he's just going to lay off babyfur art for a while. Thats good at least he ai'nt quitting completly. I dunno what I would do if FangKit would of quit! I think I would of quit furry art as well 'Cause fangkit Is the huggest Idol I have!!!  Well, anyway not much else happening here I just got back from work about 1 hour ago and I think i'm going to bed. So until next time I blog!  -Big Warm Wuff Cubby Hugs -Kit Wolf

      (*Yerf) I Back It Me, Kit Wolf!!!!  I came back from Texas two days ago but, I was so lazy so I did'nt get around to writting in my blog till well....Today! (Giggles). But I did have a lotta fun on the Texas trip. I bought a furry plushie wolf of myself (*grins) I can't resist plushies. Well, I actually did have fun from the 10 days I was gone. But the trip back was the worst..OK let me explain. Our plane connections where from:   Omaha/Midland,Texas -> Houston,Texas  -> Minneapolis,Minisoda ->Rinelander,MI.    I know I suck at spelling on the minisoda but just go with it. Well anyway we should of made to Rinelander at 4PM but we did'nt make it there till 11:30PM. There where major delays because of weather and there where a shortage on planes. (*Snorts) Don't you just love the airlines?  Well, anyways Texas was a trip. Its nothing like the UP. Its really hot mostly like in the 90's, its dry I mean really really dry, and most of all its flat. Its like you can see the next 50 miles in front of yourself cause its just flat without any trees. So it feels really good to be back in the UP with the 60 degrees weather and trees galore! Well, some of the Yooper Furs are planning to have a meet even though its only like 5 or maybe a little more people! But, It would be cool. I could ask my brother to make us some Yooper Fur tee-shirts (My brother is somewhat of an artist that airbrushes tee-shirts.) So I guess that would be kinda cool. But, I feel kinda bad 'cause Basti has to come all the way from east Upper Michigan. For him its a 5 hour drive to Hougton. For me its only around 1 1/2 to hougton!   Also, something cool happend finally got one of my friends to be a furry (She was furry related before. She did funnay animal furry drawings.) So, finally got her to be a furry (*Cheers). Her furry name is Night Wolf. Hey, my name is Kit Wolf and her's is Night Wolf. We have the same last names. Could we be related. (*Thinks) Hmm... I'll ask her 'bout it. But, anyway its been a fun week so far!  Good to be back in the good 'ol UP              -Warm Wuff Cubby Hugs                -Kit Wolf

      Ok! ok! few people know this but i get pissed at people who don't show any initiative and don't open up. At times you must open up and be truthful to yourself. Thats the only way a 'relationship' will. Well ok one person just got me really mad today it shows how our society can't speak their mind anymore. It shows how closed down we become and I for one know. It bothers me one a guy i know named Joe is not talking and a person (whom i will not mention) gets mad about this but what does she expect when they both constantly go off on eachother? They both pretty much keep to themselves...i'm not sure i consider this very cold and stand-offish why can't we live in a world free to express oursleves to our 'true' self? Oh damn guess i'm getting into the infantilism cross-anaylsis.  For one this is one thing that ticks me off. Why can't we be like we used to be when we where children? Not caring and showing emotion freely? Maybe its the sudden push we get in society instead of getting weened toward it, and only if all people could open up (At times) would this place be better?

      *yerf!* I've been trying to draw for the past 2 days but I can't! I start drawing and always choke and screw up on the angles. WTH! is wrong with me? I should get more practice in but with school and stuff its been hard. Oh well! I'll try getting ahead on schoolies and maybe on christmas break I'll resume drawing/practicing. I still gotta get that photoshop thingy done for krit too! but I just can't find a good pic for the backround :P Anyway my troubles with drawing is starting to piss me off. I can like visualize perfectly what goes on the paper but it always looks too jittery ....which is not good. So instead of drawing I'mma gonna get Kit a new beginning done! I dunno if I can finish typing before december is over but i'll try to atleast get a rough copy ^-^ Other's than that nothing really going on. I'm on the net (facing all odds of getting caught) and night ain't saying much...such an untypical woman. *giggles* -the stressed lil wolf O.o -Kit Wolf

      ......... I'm not feeling in the best of moods right now. (to Night) The reason I disconnected at 8:30 or w/e was because just as you said "she bitched you out?" my ma came over and bitched at me. *forces a laugh* Pretty Ironic. Like "BLAH BLAH don't you understand the rules of this house"? So I don't think you'll see me on AIM or phone for quiet a long time. Right now I dunno. Its my fault for hanging on the phone anyway and I -could- of not called but everytime my ma yells at me I get sucked into this depressed state and just lose motivation, get angry and freaked out. I dunno....she does'nt understand what I go through everyday of my life. Masking their 'true' son with a mature son. I wish I could come out to her but I just can't. I honesty can't remeber one time my mother has  been understanding with me in a loving caring emotional way. It tears me up inside, I know it. Everytime my ego gets crushed its like a peice of me dies and I get in this regressive infantile state. Its tough on me somtimes. I mean I don't got the worst home life ever but at times it feels like it. I know there are an unconsevable amount of people out there that feel the same as I do or even worse than I do. I just hate it.   Is Infantalism bad?  This question has been on my mind for a long time and finally I want to get it all out. I don't know the answear to this question but I'd like to discuss it between myslef. Is Infantalism bad? Well in one way it helps me cope with daily pressures of life. Expectations mostly. In another set it can be harmful to my social life as well as family life.    Socialy  People might think of you differently. Think you're sick or a pedophile. I learned I am none of these things but I used to think I was no good for society and that I was gonna turn out to be one of those sick child molesters like you hear of on the news. Other people usally don't understand you as an individual. I know I rip on Night all the time for listening to Eminem and 'Punk Rock' but, is that right? To hurt people's egos just because you disagree with something that they wear, do, or listen to? I don't think its right. I'm glad that Night never rips on me because I wear diapers or act childish at times. That could be something that would hurt my ego immensely. If it makes her happy to hear punk rock then i'm happy for her. Just as diapers are for me.   Family Life  This is where it gets tricky. My stepdad caught me in diapers and he thought it was just a phase. He picked me up from school the next day and the whole car ride home he explained to me about maturity and growing up and becoming a man. What does wearing diapers make me less mature or less of a man than I am. I guess this is why I fear growning up, I don't want to turn out to be like my mom or my stepdad. They scare me at times. My mother believing the world will come to an end and my stepdad just scarry. He reads books like national geographic and stuff like that all the time and likes to use facts alot, totally unlike me. I like to use fiction to a great extent. Such as anything is possible. But being this way does affect my family life. I often get into fights and I just want to tell them but I can't, because all the other times I told them anything well they thought I was messed up. My mother tried to get me a phsycoligist because she thought I was "not right" because I drew furries and that I enjoyed writing books instead of reading them. If I tell her that i'm an infantilist she'll prolly commit me to a mental ward or something. I basically think it would shatter the reality of our 'perfect family'.  But that still does'nt answear my question rightly. One thing I've noticed though is I use infantalism as an 'emotial crutch'. Everytime my ego gets 'crushed' or 'wrecked' in some way I regress. Its almost like a mechanism of some sort.  Take in example if my hand is my ego. Like example if my wrist is cracked and cannot operate correctly a 'crutch' is used. like a bolt and screw in my wrist. My hand can still operate correctly but only up to a point. If my 'hand' suffers further damage the mechanism cannot repair itself and in time will snap and break (tantrums and such). Unlike the natural tendons and muscles that can repair themselves in time (without wearing diapers and being completly normal if your ego is hurt it can repair itslef easily). Also my 'muscles' could lose complete control and rely on the 'crutch' for permently (ego is hurt so much that you feel like just being a baby 24/7 and forgeting your problems).  Also my 'hand' can only operate on a limited level (Such as I'm not so open on talking about my diapers much in RL face to face). Its almost like I don't like it or it scares people. I don't think I have come to terms, yet. Of me being who I am. But am I truly an infantilist and its unreversable? Is it not natural? Against the human grain? The human grain usually flows in one direction. Towards maturity. As soon as your born you begin to grow. You begin to get weened off the bottle and eat solid food and drink from the 'big boy cup' and you get rewarded for it. "Oh what a good boy BLAH BLAH...ect." Then you get potty trained and you get praised for that too. "Wow, you can use the potty just like daddy...ect." Then you go to school (yet another sign of growing up). Then you learn at school and take home pretty drawings and hang them on the fridge and such. "Did you make that for me? What a good boy ....ect." Then as you grow up the praise and attention goes away and ceses to exist. When you get in your teens the praise is replaced with punishment. Punished for 'not acting your age' Punished for talking with friends on the phone because you never see them outside of school. Punished for hanging on the internet.   But something happened to me that made me think different about going with the grain of  maturity .  They say with great knowledge comes great sorrow.  You begin to learn how messed up the world is at times. How you're praised for everything at first then at the end you're no long praised but punished and repremanded. This is why I don't want to grow up. I want to go back to the days when I was prasied for learning and learning was fun. When my mother actually paid attention to me.   I think it all started when my dad died. I was 4 years old, I think its amazing how I can remeber it. My mom and brother and sister came home crying and I was left with the babysitter for reasons I did'nt know. I asked why the where sobbing and of all people my sister picked me up and brought me to bed then she explained: The reason the left was because dad got in a bad car crash and died. I did'nt know what to think. She told me dad was never coming back home. As I type this I think of that day and tear up. I remeber crying in my sister's arms and she cried with me. Most of the times I talk with my sister on the phone she tells me about how dad was. My brothers andre and jens and my mom rather not talk about it but my sister likes to for some reason. Maybe she likes remebering those carefree days.  I remeber when my dad would come home from work. I would jump up from the couch to greet him. My mom was usally making dinner and by brothers and sister where often gone to my sister's track meets. I remember my dad. His tacky buisness suit he would take off his jacket thing and we would sit on the floor and play with lego block. I have a picture somewhere of this but rumaging and cleaning things I think I lost it. I try almost everyday I look for it but maybe my mom threw it away or something. She became very unemotinal after our dad died. At least thats what my sister says. She said mom used to be loving and understanding now she just is pestimistic about everything. I don't remeber my mom at all back then.  I dunno I don't blame them for me being an infantilist but its a factor I guess. I just don't know what to think anymore. I know I don't want to be one of those grown-ups that think about all the bad things all the time and be afraid of everything. I don't want to a be an uncaring grown-up either. I like to see people smile because around my house there is never much laughter unless I talk with one of my friends. That always makes me feel good inside. Also I defiedently don't want any children. Might be acward when you're dad tells ya he wears diapers. But I would like a girlfriend of wife that would be understanding in my infantilism. I've had two girls that tought I was sick but one was accepting and she often babied me. She moved sadly *sniffle*  But Hell! I might just give it up some day just because. I really don't like to be hurt much anymore. Plus its very hard to get adult sized diapers or any diapers because I don't live walking distance to any stores or anytime I go to town i'm with my parents or friends that no nothing of my infantilism.  Just get rid of the bolts and screws and go through a natural recovery or is infantalism an actual blue print? From god or...someone has instore for me. Is it against the  grain or is it in the grain? -a very confused wolf searching for the answears to the questsions -Kit Wolf

Its me as a lil' wolf cub with a eminem hood on and baggy pants that hang down so far that my diaper and tail is sticking out.  Its mostly a picture of me as eminem *giggles*  So yea, guess I better get moving on that and h/w, but first! I'mma gonna take a nap this lil' wolf cub is tired.

      *hums a few tunes* Oh, Yo! Whats up? I'mma waiting for Night to get done with dishes. So i'm wait'n for her. Not much going on right now. Starting three new stories Persona, South and Home. Persona is kinda complicated deals with a magic called persona. South is gonna be a babyfur/infantilist story bases around a kid named south, Of course i dunno how to make it without copying other babyfur stories. So that leaves Home. I dunno where i'm going with this story. Its about a rural country boy kid who gets kicked out of his village and faces the outside world. The outside world is very technologicaly advaced in mechanics and stuff. Its gonna be good i promise! But I should -really- get involved in Kit. Its at its most productive stage right now and the elements are starting to fit better than ever before! Now that I wrote some of Home yesterday I noticed my writing is becoming so much more advanced! ^-^ So right now i'm so playful *growl* My stepdad is working in the bathroom now but as soon as i get on the phone with Night.... ^-^ ITS DIAPER TIME! Also i was looking around and found an interesting explaination in Infantilism  urlLink dpf.com/theory.html  It got me thinking if I'm a healthy infantilist or unhealthy infantilist. It also got me thinking about that christian AB group and that they might not be as nutty as I thought. -All for deep thoughts and wet diapers -Kit Wolf :P

Just got done with a very rough copy of my antimatter research paper, that made me immensely happy and yea. Algebra a somewhat caught up and i'm making it! I think i'm starting to make it out of this damn hole i dug for myself. No more slacking off in class for this lil wolf ^-^' So now i'm here...1 liter of cherry cola and dinner later, typing on this blog.  :P not that its a bad thing! *giggles* Today some more happy stuff made me happy! Arel finally came through and got me a version of photshop 6 and bryce 5! I've been dabbing in em both here and there. but i seriously need more ram. Now that i got photshop maybe i can now make that photo manipulated image for Krit. But i have no idea what to do. My photshop thing in art class is coming along well. But could'nt get any pics of Night and Margo in it yet Stupid rachel signed out the camera ....get this!...FOR ALL DAY LONG! So when i was in study hall i could'nt do that either *grr* My Pen and Ink is complete somewhat. I have no idea how to shade fur with pen but w/e. MCabe said she liked it. She could'nt beleive it was actually mine :P go figure. Anyway I'm sitting here in a NOW very wet diaper and i gotta take a shower, read nights story and call her at 9....maybe lol! -warm wuff cubby huggies -kit wolf

I still got h/w cramed up my furry lil' be-hind and gotta get caught up on it or i'm never gonna get out of this hole! Mr. Uotila told our class a quote I found .....totally AWESOME!  With Great Knowledge Comes Great Sorrow" Well its his version of it the origanal version i heard is "In much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow" That should be in the bible. I know i'mma nut for detail but Oh well. Got me thinking about things. How can this place be SO messed up but in the end be SO right, anyway? So things are back to as normal as normal can be. I just took a shower and diapered up for a LLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGGG time of 'speed' alegebra. :P Oh something cool happened last night! I saw the real slim.....SII! He looks pretty cool kinda a complete opposite of what i thought but i'm not a good catch either. and tomorow i gotta get bust'n my chops on my 6 page essay research paper on anitmatter.  Our ART1 Class worked on Photoshop today so labtime was pretty fun. I'm suprised how well I can handle photoshop. *thinks* Charlie is the master of teaching. Took me two days of lab to finally figure out how layers, screening, layer modes and different blurs and noises work. Not to complicated for this lil wolf cub tho!

      *pounce and lick!*  Yo, yo whats been up? Who the heck reads this stuff anyway *giggles* Been a long time since I actually typed somthing in this damn thing. So yea guess i'll type for a while. I got a stupid report thingy to do on antimatter :P thats always fun...NOT!  FAKE OUT! I'mma tricky wolf pup ^-^         Anyway intersting stuff has accumulated in the last week or so. I've actually been questioning myself as an individual and sharing in with others! Well by that I mean Night. I've been actually so full of myself lately but not in a bad way, I guess. I've been seeing things in a positive light for once. Me and Night where on the phone till 2:30 just thinking about 'stuff' in general. Tragedy, War, Religion, Books, Stories, Parents, People, Life, Relationships, 'The Gears of The World and Love in genral. I know i'm a hopeless romantic *giggles*  But she got me thinking, thinking about things in ways i've never thought possible. I would actually think about going out with her but others than people at school pointing and laughing at us I don't think she'd ever want to take care of an oversized wolf pup. As an added plus she's not that far informed on that part of me :/ Just a personal opinion, but yea. I asked her if she ever thought about having children and she said well kinda flat out no. That I thought was kinda weird. Every girl I practically knew wanted to have children at some time or another. That just struck a cord on me that hit a lil kit nerve. Of course, I thought of having children but ya know. You take care of them when they are like born then they grow up and push you away then relationships slowly crumble and you never talk to them. Two opposing sides I guess. I dunno guess its the weather. This lil' pup does'nt like being stuckies inside. I wanna go outsides! But now its really getting to me. I've been talking to alotta people online and been thinking. Is infantalism actually a 'bad' thing or 'good' thing? I know its not normal thats for damn sure! But i've been thinking how me and infantalism relate. ??? I confuses me for the most part???  I dunno if its a fetish (sexual attraction) or if its on the other end of the spectrum (A 'Return to Innocence'). A Mixture of both? I dunno. I guess i'm embarking on a long tedious journey. Does everyone go through a phase such as this? Would it be the safest to just give it up? I tried that a few times. But I'm wiser than I used to be back then, and well its just bothering me. I talked to Night about it but I'm sure she does'nt want to hear about it and I'm not keen enough to talk about it. Others than that stuff has been happening. A day has to die for a new one to give light. *sigh* How I long for the days that work, school and responsibility was a thing of the future. I wish I could just go back to when I felt cared, loved and just complete lack of responsibility. I know lack and too much responsibility is not a good thing but i did'nt ask for it in the first place. *sigh* maybe I should be a pshycoligist. I know Night is gonna read this and think i'm a total ...crazy! but oh well. everyone needs to talk about things sooner or later and now i'm actually willing. I'm just complelty perplexed she never asked me questions about it. I've been the one always asking questions about her and I still don't have a damn clue. But don't get me wrong she is very headstrong and opinonated individual. Much like myself of course she keeps it to herself. I think this is the best friendship-relationship i've ever had. I like her alot and i dunno if she knows that.....NOT LIKE THAT *giggles* Well guess i'll post this go online or something and play some more random chords i'm starting to get a jingle ^-^ Damn i'm such an amateur at this guitar crap! lol -warm wuff cub hugs -kit wolf  PS: If anyone reads this by mistake....Especially Ted or someone else I really could care less.

      *Trudges around* Well, the cog wheels are turning again. Aken is in kind of in a sad mood. Much like how I get from time to time. Everything just seems to be a-okay at the OK corral then it all just you see finally with un blurry eyes the world in which you live in. It can be so messed up at times, confuses the hell out of me. I hate being so young and un educated about the world when most of it you have to learn through trial and error and thinking. I hate it so much when people have problems and I can't even think of a clever quote or something to use. I feel so stupid sometimes.   *starts the ranting* Well for one thing that always bothered me is that i'm fixated with life it amazes me. It amazes me that one person can dream up a whole world but somtimes can't express it. Its like all the good things in life keep me going and all the bad things make me want to sit in a dark corner and just cry. Even tho there are less good things in the world and more bad things *in numbers* somehow its always weird that even with the few good things it still out ways the million bad things. What exactly is it that makes people precieve things as good or bad? I've come to learn that all things are in on catergory, life. Sometimes its even hard to find the words to express what it is. Guess the world is just seems so small but in the end its huge! Its immense but the individual can even be bigger. I still feel small anyway. People sometimes credit me for what i do wether drawing, or writting. My english teacher told me to apply my selft. I am and i'm getting good grades. My art teacher told me just to imagine things more like a puzzle. guess thats why i feel in love with drawing and writting. Its like a puzzle. First you find the shapes then you get the picture to look just right. You step away from your work and its a whole no longer in peices. Then there are the other people. I have few friends. and yes they are still my friends, just not that close. They believe i'm a weirdo cause I write and draw. Even one really hurt me not too long ago and said "That drawing sucks" It was a graphic prespective of a bus. I got a A+ on it in art class and the teacher said it looked good.  Up close it does'nt but if you take a few steps back the lines over lap and a bus clearly appears. Some people just can't see with that depth and take a step back to look at things instead of just talking a close glance.  I saw her pictures as well. I told her they where very good but to work more on the color. I just don't know her art does'nt wow me but I can't draw like her so i'm not one to judge.  A showed a few of the same pics to my other friends and they love me for it. They said wow and all kinds of things. Especially night. I think she would make a great cartoonist or fantasy drawer I don't think I would wiegh to be anything in an artistic career. She always says good things, even when i push her to say the bad. I wonder about her sometimes. Am I actually fairly good, or am i a complete flop?  Everyone had an individual style.   My two favorites ray bradbury and fangkit. Fangkit actually told me a great deal to teach me to draw and he even helped me on my own style. Ray Bradbury after reading a few books and short stories taught me to write down things but not make it boring, he also taught me to be an individual but function as a whole. Its like the situation at work. People are all individuals but don't want to work with the whole.  But hey, thats just how people are :)

Of course she's never saw me in that role, she might not for quite some time.... Otherwise everything is just weird, things have been different these past few days. The dance was pretty okies, thats when I asked Night out. Tonight I'm planning to ink a piccy i'm making for the public rec center thingy and then prolly diaper time once again. Oca had showed me how to make modifed diapers so I won't need to change as often... *giggles* i've been finding out my badder is a little more lose than normal, so i might give it up for a while till it regains.

Other news we got 2 feet of snow so i'm snowed in. Glad I don't have work YAY! *jumps around* Wonder how Gaius is gonna be traveling in all this stuff. We are suppose to get rain tomorrow. Tonight I'll write more on South. I'm getting to a good part, its sad too but you'll just have to wait till i finish this looooooooonnnnng chapter. I sent an email to my sis because she said a drew a sideview of a wolf that is bouncing a ball on his knees. She must be smoking crack or something cause I don't remeber drawing that. Kit Silverfox pointed me to a cool creative card making game.  urlLink http://www.dvorakgame.co.uk/  Maybe I should make a gundam wing, furry or babyfur game. That would kick tail.  What else we got on news. Not much, I'm so curious on how pandr is doing. Hope he does'nt get so blind he does'nt write. He had a cool babyfur story that had a good prespective. I like it a bunch.

      *yerfs and pounces* Well some stuff came up. Aken broke up with Gaius probably because of the move. Aken is still moving around and Gaius is moving back up to the UP tomorrow. Pandr posted after I made a post on littlefursclubhouse and he said my story inspired him to write more. *giggles* guess he likes south. I'm actually talking to pandr now.  I met a new fur this morning who has been a furry for 6 years and bf for 3. He is pretty coolies. His name is Kit Silverfox. Kitsune fox actually. I think I read an artical on kitsune foxes by him. Kitsune foxes are mythlogical japanese folklore elemental foxes. I'll kill night soon, i'm listening to my december by linkin park. Its the same thing over and over but works so well with the snow outside.   I'm going to write more on south tonight, I promised everyfur I know I will. hmm haven't seen fangy or rusty in a while, wonder how they are doing. Oh yesterday I also met some downstate babyfurs. Draco Americanus and Ikazuchifox well I seen em around before but only till now did i really get to meet then, but that still makes me the only babyfur in the UP. Hey maybe when I finish South I'll post it on proxima's they get alot of babyfurs throught that site.......ers i gotta get mine up too.... -until next time -Kit Wolf

I barely did any progress on Kritter's payback....hehe Algebra went extremly well, i finshed early on Principals and Amounts and Interests. Finally something new to learn now its no longer a stupid repeat. I got an email back from a fellow fur from yerf and i'm getting good tips, tricks and places to get good software. Got my ram yesterday my computer runs so smooth. We are starting in pottery in art class. Its so hella neet :P Nothing nothing nothing goin on. Night played b ball yesterday that surprised the flying raccoon-squirrl outta me....and i need a pocket dictionary. Got a new book yesterday, why do we say that? Its a collection of phrases and the story behind em. I love/hate books :P ....and Night better not get me anything for my Birthday.....*wink wink...:)  -Wolf cub Growl -Kit Wolf

      *yerfies* Newgrounds.com is down. Never been there for almost 3 years, and I just found out today. I'm so happy sii is drawing furries again and this weekend i suffered minor injuries. Broke my nose in a door, cut my right thumb with a razor and got a huge splinter in my left index finger. All in all the weather is boosting my spirits. *huffs* I love the smell of rotting stuff and spring time. Prolly because I was born in spring. April 4rth. My new ddr ram should be coming soon too. Hope it does'nt break like the last stick I bought. Basti was on again last night. I assume he is always on the much on saturday. If my grades are good this week I can go online like it used to be....like all day long! Wow too many uses of the word 'like' "Like i'm soooo popular mi'cha" *giggles* i hate teen girls.  I got my carving in too. Its not done but most then what others got. My demented coyote.  Speaking of drawing I still gotta work on my rebel type furs. What can I say I got a soft spot for male furs in leather jackets and jeans with boots. :)  Nothing really planned today, draw a piccy for payback on kritter MWA HA HA! and i have to get back into drawing babyfurs. I was surprised i'm getting emails from fellow furs who haven't seen me around. I'm such a ghost at times. ^-^  Not much to do today, nice spring day for being lazy fat chubby foxie obsessed wolfy :P  Oh personal reminder....i gotta get diapers and stuff *giggles* I hate shopping in Ontonagon or White Pine...  Well until next study hall or if something happens....to me....or someone else  -warm wuff cubby hugs -Kit Wolf

      *wolf cub howl*  Been a long time blogger. Getting all my work in for Algebra is horror. I'll get it done in my history class, hopefully. My English grade is now a C-, but I wonder what my art grade is....probably not that good considering I did really bad on my metal project. i've been drawing more, and working in anime once again. Been a really long time since I drew anime. I still want to get the ISB comics and I got a whole shopping list on computer parts and DVDs. I still wish I could draw like Marci...or Fangkit for that matter. Marci is good at line art and Fangy is really good at the color and fur shading. Arel is going to burn me photoshop 7 on a cd and I'll get a whole bunch of adobe software from Sii so I'm glad.  Last night I talked to all the furs on the MiFur channel. None of them I remeber....I was rarely on there anyway. Nice group of people as well. Can't remeber there names tho. I'm so crappy at that. Sii, Basti and Kritter are coming up to Onto's this summer. Hopefully I won't be working on that day.  Which reminds me *personal note*  TURN IN MI WORKS SHEET! Other other news I'm not going to be able to go to the white pine saturday dance...don't got a damn ride, so i'll be stuck working at the konteka once again while chris is at the baraga dance, stef is doing karaoke and erin and everyone else is partying while i'm stuck minimum wage bussing other people's messes. They should just give them a bib or something. Might reduce my workload. SO busy and such little time. Writing, Drawing, Eating, Sleeping, Internet Related Stuff, Breathing, Thinking....the last two are such a hassle. And Margret is complaining about acne and doing genral math. My neck hurts, CNN is on TV and I'm so sick of this damn war. We don't even need the damn oil. But ya know from that kuwait stuff back then that crazy saddam needs to agree. He's like the next hitler, even harming his own people. *looks down and sees his paws on the bitch box*  erfs *hops down* sorry bout that. :P    I'm trying to make yet another story, one that might not get anywhere, and i'm thinking of merging it like what I did with Persona and Winter Wolf which i still think would be more suited as a game. Lets see:  Kit A New Beginning Kit Remix Identity Crisis Winter Wolf South  *giggles* i'm surprised at how much fun i'm having with South. Its such a cool story with the contrast of confuzzlement, love, hate and just got so much emotion seen through this boy's eyes. Kit I like because its so mysterious and doe'snt get good till the middle at the climax but the climax stays high till the last 2 pages. Identity Crisis I see so much as a movie with special effects. Walls melting shit like that and got that goopy parent stuff in it. Winter Wolf got stupid RPG elements. The remix of kit is shorter and alot different. Relationship and religion wise. Well Lunchtime...to whoever reads this damn thing see ya saturday!  -warm wuff cubby hugs -Kit Wolf

      *Pounces and yips around*  I feel so jittery and hyper today.  Maybe it was that apple two bags of chips and diet dr pepper i had before i came to school. But i'm happy anyway, I drew a new picture last night and learned that turning off the music actually does help when drawing. I drew a rebel skater punk wolf but and i spelled his shirt rebel reble :P I gotta work on spelling guess that'll be my trademark, spelling things wrong. Not much going on today now that i actually am handing in my assignments my grades are going higher. Whoda thunk it? Ok nothing new have'nt heard back from the hard drive people....yet! i'll email them tomorrow if things go bad. -diapered wolf cubby hugs -Kit Wolf

      Been a while since my lil self gotta another post in here. Well I finally broke my computer, the hard drives actually, I partitioned my 80gig wrong and turned my xp 3gig into a paperweight. First time i ever screwed up my computer badly where i lost 2 os es (linux and windows xp). Anyway my weekending was hectic. First off on saturday we had to serve at the konteka for those really really rich and anal retentive people so I was hired to make us look professional. That place is actually looking nicer, since we hired that manager. Anyway I was talking to my ex at the bar having a pop after work and snowmobilers came in this guy hit a telephone poll and he was bleeding badly. They needed something for the blood. So I went to the back room and gave them a bunch of towels while lacy called the ambulance. Lacy was bad when the group came back and said he died before they got back to him. Of course the guy that died was drinking in the bar. Much to say the other snowmobliers got spooked and filled our hotel. While me and my ma where driving home i had to look outside at the snow to keep my self from looking at my mom. I dunno i get like that where i bite my lip and over think. I called stef and talked for a while. Just thinking about those things, I get like that usually i'm so happy and jumping around. When I think about those things i'm just like lost and depressed. I did'nt even feel like babying out when i got home after work. It was like a ritual but instead i listened to music wrote hung up the phone cause it was like 11:30 and fell asleep on the floor. Then i asked night why do these things always happen to me, because she usually is so held back and quite. I really don't know maybe its because i'm growing up so fast, too quick. I also asked her what she's gonna do after HS. I really don't know what i want to do. When i was young I wanted to always be a fire fighter or police officer (like my bro) but now i dunno maybe preach, night says i can be a comedy person, or it would be cool to be a teacher like my art teacher who is retireing. She is just so awesome guess i'll make another post about here when she leaves, she taught me alot. -warm wuff cubby hugs -Kit Wolf

      YAY! A blog postie  Ok bathroom is almost done, got rid of the junk in the computer room, now we got tons of room. Now, i'm struggling with uotila's creative writing. Ted even said that uotila's subjects don't let me write in the style i do write in. I dunno wtf that means but w/e. He was reading through my stories while i was in the bathroom, kinda pissed me off but its good to hear a kind word. Kritter was on yesterday but did'nt have time to talk. Talked to aristowolf about movie formats and anime. She is really cool at anime. Well life is going ok, few bumps here and der. My bro should be sending me my prismacolor markers soon, because i havent heard from him erps. Well i'm gonna get my tail busting in art class before i flunk. I hate clay and dat stuff. History and all my other classes are going smoothly, i already mentioned english ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Ok, not many people on the wired, and i'm still trying to do this english  -all it takes is a shake of your tail and *POOF* you're a wolf too -Kit Wolf

      Wow this sucks..... I gotta work from 1 o clock until closing time. Well i'll be happy. My mom has been really pissed. I was on the phone with my boss at work and she's pestering me who is it who are you talking to blah blah, while i'm writting my work shedule. As soon as i got off the phone i yelled at her really loud. "Shut the HELL! UP!" She still drove me to work, but she did'nt say a word. It was so bad infact brad had to pick me up from work. Brad started disscussion trying to cheer me up. It worked a little. I called Night but her phone had a bad crackle so i said i'd call back today or something. After that i went online for a bit then went off to practice Karate. I'm surprised i still remeber katas. I drew a few things but nothing in time for easter, and i gotta go to work in a hour anyway.  I had more conflict this morning when brad went online and had troubles. I could'nt help him, but mom blames me anyway. It was then Brad's turn to talk back hehe. I think they are still talking. Oh my mom is a freak at times. well HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE! -------------Think of me when i'm working-------------------------------  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

Like a rocket booster *giggles* Also i need to get away from my ma, we we're driving eachother nutz so i guess it was really good! Well i saw the artist at the teen center and wow do i want to draw badly! I mean draw good but badly because aw nevermind.

      the diapered wolf comes bouncing out!*  Hiya, ok stuff thats been up. Well last night i had to go to work and we closed early i got home at 10pm. But while we were in the backroom Sue said something interesting. We were talking about parents and i was eating then sue says "if you think your life is bad, go spend one week with adan. He has a tough mother." I was like someone agrees! But then I came to realize why my mom is such a hard ass. She does'nt want me to be rude, lazy, and irrespossible or undependable.  On the ride home we talked about the rebuilding of Austria after WW2. Since my mom is 49 and lived in that era. She said the american solidgers that were mad at the german people shot out good windows to make it tougher in rebuilding. They also hoarded food supplys that belonged to the german people. Wars are crazy wow. I went for a bike ride today and I drew a bunch last night. Just sketches not much. Now i'm just waiting online for Night cause i'm bored. Well i'm waiting for anyone as a matter of fact. Everyone is gone right now. Well spring break, 1 week off! I'm going to the teen center tomorrow wif night.  -don't wait up -Kit Wolf

      Pose made april 06 10pm   Ok blogger time to blog! Played Sii on UT online, his lag time was so incredible the only thing we could do is kill eachother or both of us with the redeemer. (no wonder they put that thing in that game) Talked to lighting, he was back on yahoo. I watched his webcam again. He moved in with little Dobie and a furry mate, so now they are in dobie's house. I gotta meet those florida babyfurs someday. 2 New babyfurs joined on the message boards Oh yea Night got her stuff working again so she's online, i could'nt talk to her because I was playing Sii then Brad had to call his brother and bumped me off *grr*  I'm actually blogging offline. I took out all of Brad's old tapes and wow he has good taste in music. Enya, Starship, Bonnie Tyler, Belinda Carlisle, Duran Duran, and other bands...Yes is there too hehe I'm actually listening to Starship right now and I want em as mp3's. Thats gonna take forever to download. I watched Queer as Folk again last night. Its a gay show but it kicks ass! This one gay dude had to babysit his 12 year old nephew and when he found the dude stealing outta his wallet the gay guy stormed out of the shower took the money out of his pocket then gave him a swirly. When he was done he said �this is why you don't fuck with gays� I was like Holy Crap! Then when his nephew went back home he called the cops and said the gay dude molested him. Which he didn't, then this like 16 year old gay dude caught on to the bastard nephew and made him confess. Can't beleive a gay show touched that much on subjects. It goes to show that gays aren't pedofiles even tho thats first people's impression of them. Kinda like Infantilists, Iguess. It was a very emotional episode. It actually shows how mean people can be. �Gays are going to hell! Godless fags� People really hated gays in that one. But how could you not relate that to anything weird? Well to say i'm gonna watch that show again, comes on tonight at 10. Hehe I watched it all summer vacation and now i'm watching it again.....could this be a bad thing? .....that show kicks ass. I hope Kritter's night job ain't draining him too much, he wasn't online for a while. Oh I almost forgot to mention I applied for VCL I turned in 3 piccys. The Tiger I drew for Anamio, the foxie I fixed up in photoshop and my recent rebel fur I did in pen in study hall. They are all in different mediums just to show furs what I can do. Some of the VCL artists suck so it should be a sinch to get in. Not as hard as yerf ;) But they are all professional artists. I hope to be one someday.  Pandr got me a little present. It was a piccy he found of grumpy bear from 'care bears' that was coolies I thanked him, he's a kick tail fur. I also talked a little more to Rusty and Aristowolf. Actually something funny Rusty had a dream about me and him in the car. He feel asleep and he dreamed that me and him where in a forest, then the ground broke up from underneath us. A few furs came up to us then we looked at eachother and we had tails. Weird, huh?   *huffs* Brad better get off  the phone soon or i'm gonna snap in two! ......... Ok he's off! -warm wuff cubby hugs -Kit Wolf

      Tomorrow is my birthday...:P *turnes into evil kit* I HATE BIRTHDAYS *GRRS!*  But I guess it won't be that bad. Today was awesome I got outta my afternoon classes to see a play, based on the book the odd couple. Its so awesome, Arel and Mr. Amos played the sexy spainish foreigners. Its basiclly a play about two roomates who are totally different. I wonder if Sii's theater thing was cool to, I know ours was. Kind of a yiffy play but funny as hell, I loved it. *giggles* I got a thing for the theater, and ballet dancing. (does'nt know how to spell) The 'wired' is boring at the moment. Night went on last night at her grandma's which was pretty cool. Still not much, getting outta my drawing rut and learning alot again. Still not yerf material ;) I still am working on my anime too, Gerome asked if I would make him a few FF type characters that are over flashy, and I'll do some tonight :)  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

The hard drive on my laptop is starting to develop bad sectors and it is really bothering me, its about the same exact thing that happened to my 80gb hard drive....NOOOOO!  At least with my miworks summer job i'll be able to upgrade this laptop to be beefy and  upgrade and get some new parts on the big computer. Also I  want to save up to get some kind of mac, either a laptop mac an i-pod or a emac.  I purged through all my sketches and threw away a whole big trash  bag full of unfinished sketches, guides and things like that. I'm planning to redo alot of the old drawings because they sucked so much. But what to do with all the stuff I scanned, I put it in a green folder  maybe Night wants it....so do you Night? If you want to you could  submit some of the good ones to the teen center...if you want. Because I really gotta start drawing new things as my style is changing for the better.  I just don't know what to do with the old drawings so might as well  give em away. I wish i had a fileing cabinet.

The rain brought out a lot of color outside, which is always nice.  Wrote a little bit more on Kit and I should add more because Margo wants to read it. My teacher said I should try to publish it when I get the 5th revision done. Or if i could i could try to get it in a furry zine. Even if most of it is not furry related but furries are a main population so it all works good.  Drawing hmm...not much studying alot from fox and the hound. I revised my guides for more realistic cartoony effect.  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf  (mega star)

      Lost it all today. 75GB of my 80GB hard drive. I got a virus that crashed my Z:  I rebooted and everything was normal. Except I could'nt read anything from the Z: it was in the ntfs format. I tried to convert it ...no luck....Scan disk...no luck....even system restore acted like it did'nt exist. So i prayed for a while, even thought i'm not religious and well I formated the Z:. Lost all my dvds, videos, software, but luckly i had some old software disks floating around......photoshop 6, i miss my photoshop 7 now. And since all my software was on my harddrive i'm going to have to download 3 years worth of software. Atleast it did'nt completely kill my system. Thank you lord.   I suppose sii's computer bad luck rubbed off on me:P Not to mention I lost all my stories i had typed up.....35 pages of kit...gone.....between fur and machine...gone....persona....gone...all my old art....gone.......3gb of music....gone i had some backed up only about 600mb tho. Well guess i get a really fresh start. All my emails i had stored are gone as well. *sniffles* So guess i can't catch up in all those old posts i have download...ahem...had downloaded. ALL MY BEAUTIFUL FREEWARE.....hard to find some of those nowadays.....  Well on a bighter side i'm buying chris's laptop. His laptop and an external hard drive thats really slow for like 180$ hehe good buy for that price...I'll be getting it monday *YAY!*   Then i'll upgrade the hard drive on that and then make a nice wireless network around the house, its gonna be great!   On the other side, if kritter reads this, I dunno if we are actually going to be able to get together, unless i can scam my stepdad, highly doubt it because he wants me to help him with the roof all summer. But i'll keep trying, but i'm starting to highly doubt if we'll get together. Well atleast next year i'll have my license.  Well sitting here i was drawing and wow! Night YOUR PEN SUCKS TAIL!

I read a good book yesterday, the whole thing actually, not hard it was a Gary Paulson book anyway. But it was about a Union soliger growing up and witnessing war. It was very good, gary paulson was always a good writer. I liked hatchet and brians winter a whole bunch. I'm trying to get Uotila's stuff done for english. No too hot my grades are in dat class :L  What else oh ozy and millie, it seems so relevant for something in 1998 NIGHT GET YO!

      Lots has been happening lately. Well not LOTS but tons of little things that either made me happy or proved a challenge. My new v.92 modem came today, makes me very happy. But it did'nt come with any drivers so i'll have to download more. Well you can tell the year is winding down in academics. Sii is finishing his year of college and i'm just breezing through all the huge amounts of homework so far in this quarter. Of course next year i'll change and just always do my h/w because it does prove to help all year round. Art is going not so well I still gotta start zooming in that, but I think i'll make it. Clay is not my forte. I just can't wait to see who our new art teacher is going to be, maybe Mr. Bodie, then again maybe not. What else happened, I did tons of sketches in my drawing pad, not much else. But now I don't have anymore diapers *whimpers* And I think it will be a while till I get to Houghton or anywhere soon, and i'm not keen about buying my baby supplies in town at all! So I suppose I won't and play it safe. But I still wonder if I can fit into a pampers size 6. I doubt it by now but still some aby adults can.....hmm What else has been up? Not much else I've been pretty happy today. It is raining tho. Oh yea get this Ted borrowed me UT 2003 to copy BUT he did'nt get me the key to it. But i think brandon has it anyway. Which ticks me off because I can't play it now....*ggrrr* Okay not much else today, my mom might be leaving this month to Austria :)  Which will make me very happy, until later... -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

      *big exhale* Passed my driving test, really i don't think z shoul've gave me my cerfificate because I drove really really really bad today. Only things he said was flawless was the reverse pull out of the garage which ted almost failed. Arg well at least I got it and in the end thats all that counts. Still trying to type south chapter 2 up. Just have'nt been in the mood. Also i feel really bad because I still got to get that fox pic done for Karavan. I did a really neat piccy of me and night and i spent 7 hours last night and the night before doing computering it. Karis playground was on somethingawful.com yesterday, kinda sad that people don't know much about furries and infantilism. Wow i'm so tired. These weeks have been hectic.   Atleast I'll be working full time at the porkies monday, friday is the last day of konteka work until winter. Also friday I want to get in town maybe the teen center will take my art work with the photoshop stuff. They better. Some of that stuff there really really sucked in that gallery. But then again the other section are all professional artists that kick ass. So I don't know. Hanging online now maybe talk to Night a bit see what she's been up to. Last night I talked to Sii for like 4 hours straight on aim. It was crazy. We talked about furries alot. Even though I remeber all the explaining we did when we first met. I guess it was kind of a reminder why we are on eachother's buddy lists.  Oh almost forgot. Jeff the ontran driver I drew him a furry pic he loves it. Also he said it would be so cool to wear a full body fur suit. And he admited it would be a turn on. Then I explained to him furries a little more and the next day when I rode that bus he said he had a weird dream about us. I was a wolf with a collar, but I was a shaky wolf. And he was a shaggy dog and i would nudge his hand and he would brush me and when he stopped brushing I growled at him. It was very crazy. I don't think I ever had a dream like that but he did. I usually only have dreams about like me and Night being babyfurs *blushies* so embarassing, actually.   Got all my chores done for today, I want to draw a wolf holding a brush with a collar on for jeff by tomorrow. Because might be the last time i'll see him drive that bus ever.    Also reminder to myself: get lots of sleep for monday.   Well my few and far between fellow readers, bye bye  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

Man the way down was a breeze but taking the stuff out of the cabins and lugging that heavy stuff in the big backpack up hill...blech! Well still better than yesterday, yesterday we transported gravel and put it on the sides of the roads. ALL DAY! Was about 13 truck loads of gravel. But can't bitch I should get my pay check in another week or so. Emailed my sister again. I haven't drawn anything i tried to last night but i just could'nt I dunno its freaking me out again.

      Offline post made at 5/20/03 5:19:49 PM on Microsoft Word Dear Blog, 	Not much going on. Jens and his family is over. Hehe at least I get to play wif my nephew, gabriels, stuff :) WEEEE! A Bubble Lawn Mower. They are gone right now and I�m waiting to call Night soon. So, I�m just playing with all the toddler toys. Its pretty fun. Wow, has Gabriel grown, man he�s calling me Uncle giggles at least he does�nt say Adan or something stupid like that. I hate my name and I�ll say that time and time again. 	I�m obessed with the animation on fox and the hound. Its animation is done so the characters hardly look the same in each shot but you know its them. It just seems far more natural. Even if a talking fox and dog is�nt naturally natural. It has a lot more feeling put into the characters unlike most of the new Disney. Spirt was an ok one but its use of 3d made it seem kind of cold. I really did�nt not like the expression of the horses. I guess I�m really strict when it comes to movies. Well okies time to do some chores and maybe call Slade.  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf  Blast in the past hehe Thought i'd post it....

      Almost ever furry test I take i'm a wolf    You are a wolf. Everyone likes you. Everyone wants to be you. You're not too conceited, and you have more common sense than anyone. You know where you're going in life, you're strong and independent, and you won't let anything stand in your way. Your children will grow up strong in your ways as well as anyone that comes in contact with you. You like to lead and tend to be a tad bossy, but those faults will come in handy in the real world. Humans admire your courage and nobility, though rarely are they ever worthy of your love. Much like your evolutionized self, the doggie, you are very trustworthy and loyal. Try to loosen up a bit, learn from a doggie person, and put your feet up. Don't try so hard to handle everyone's problems and then become disappointed when something doesn't go your way. Remember that you cannot control everyone's destiny and that you need to think of yourself once in a while. Get your eating habits and sleeping habits back in order, and then spend some time alone to think. Try something new and exciting, such as an excercise or an exotic food. Taking time alone can be soothing as well as rejuvenating. Keep your wise nature strong and learn to grow in it! o^_^o    urlLink   Are You A Furry?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Did the bath tub get smaller or did the worse thing in my life just happen?   Yes it is true ageing sucks, ever Rastlin fox said it. I sucks.  Had a trip back in time playing n64 at teds, man that is a kick ass console. (But still waits for RE2 and HL2 to come out in winter. *grins* Well went on irc channels again, been a long time, Mifurs are idel as always and the babyfurs are griping, as always. Fangkit got back from holland a while ago.  The dance yesterday was no real treat, would've had more fun if Night was in a car and flicked on and off the high beams and we would've played rock on a boom box. Revised Kit a new beginning again, Kit gets thrown in jail until the cops let him out. Still thinking on minor plot changes but the main plot is always the same. Basti bitched how yooperfurs group was idel again and I'm still trying to break the idelness on furry teens. Lazy ass teens, i tell ya  >;-P' Talked to a few furs today,  Storm Wolf  but ice in my diaper again *shivers*   Rusty  is watching a movie at his friends house (poor fox hope he gets his diapies soon)  P Wolf  (atomskiwolf) is as good as he's ever been playing his digieridoo.  Crssa Fox  from Mifurs got married, I havent talked to her on irc since we dissed the power mac g4 cube *toaster puter* I tried to hunt her down to wish her all da good stuff but she has'nt been on. And  Rastlin  I just met today, a now white fox. Can't forget i talked to  alpine artic fox , well said homie and he said hey and it went back and forth.  Felt like bolding that because its easier to keep track. - no deep thoughts today -  -yay home alone *happy dances on the couch* -Kit Wolf

      "And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am"  I'm getting closer to finding Rusty hehe  You have to love Yahoo Profiles. I know I do. If I can get online at home I'll so some serious searching, or if Night can help me out. *sigh* I think just 1 week and 5 days I'll be able to get online at home, hopefully.  Well not much happening around here today, doing lots of art lately, one scratchboard for english, a few sketches here and there in my drawing book, did a wolf howling at a cresent moon for art, i'll have to finish painting that. And I'll have to work on a yooper fur post.  I should work on a full ink picture or something, but I did acomplish to make a witty plot for a comic strip 4 panel like. Maybe I'll email David Simpson and do a short interview with him, would be pretty cool. Finally U2 is playing on my head set, sings, "And I wait with or without yoooou"  Oh last night on the screen savers they showed microprocessers. WOW! Intergrated chips, AUDIO VGA AND CPU IN ONE!!!!!!!! That's crazy and they ran win xp on little handheld device, that amazes me. My ACER can't even run it. Also they had this now way of putting data onto roatating hard drives. ......the main point, not gigs but terrabytes of data (1000's of GB's) Terra bytes! on moving storage, contained in the same size as any hard drive in the space of less than a BIG drive bay.....Just boggled my mind, I used to run BASIC language on old old computer, DOS computer.

      Kit is missing you.... I miss you I can't breathe no more don't really feel like talking no one here to love me wondering if you're the same  *yerf* Well I finally hit it. Its been 2 weeks and I haven't seen rusty on at all. and everything has been awful. Can't sleep, well i can but its been so ackward. Friday I slept from 7pm to 9 am. And Last night I slept for 12 hours. I've had so much trouble with dreams as well. Waking up all sweaty, panic stricken, pissing myself (good thing I wore diapers to bed).Last night i had tons of dreams but 2 of em I remember quite well. I was searching in the back 40 of my woods. Looking for someone. Worried. The sky was pouring with rain and clashesof thunder and lighting all around me. I was scared. And when I came out of the woods back to the house I was attacked by a weird looking dog. Kinda like a doberman but a messed upface. And I had to punch it 2 times in the head for it was biting onto my right hand and it would'nt let go. When I finally subdued it, I ran back in the house. And I awoke. It was raining outside and I was full of sweat and my diaper was soaked. So I went into the  bathroom to change and clean up, it was 4 am on the green lit clock. Then when I drifted back to sleep I had a dream that hit harder to home. I was kit, its been so long since I dreamed about Kit and it was scary. I was only wearing a diaper and I was holding my blanket. I was scared and I was standing infront of a dark hallway. It looked like my house hallway but so much taller and extreamly dark. The toddled farther in it got alot darker and I started calling for Rusty. "Rrrrr-rru-rus?....Rus?" Like that and then it started raining and thundering, well the sounds i could hear and I ran farther and farther. Until I woke up. I felt like crap all day, I still do. And I miss Rusty, and I think i'm to the point that I'm never going to see him again. I  think about him less, But I still think about him everyday. And millions of things run through my mind each day. If he misses me too? I'm sure he does. Or if he's under gong consouling to get him off infantlism. And that next time I meet him he'll have no feelings kinda like a zombie. Or that his rent's understand his need for diapers and baby him at home and when he tries to use the phone or computer he can't because he is a 'baby' and little 'babies' can't do that. And he has to sleep in a crib and stuff. It soothes my mind more then the other results I came up with. But its a fat chance. Another is that he ran away and he's on the streets right now, cold. Rainy, the more I think about cold rain as the weather here remains crummy. He also has a record of drugs and going homeless on the streets.  And I also can't help but think about the phone conversations and all the IM windows.  somtimes we would tell our other friends to buzz off or say we'll brb so we could just talk with now interuptions. And the last IM i talked to him he saw my web cam and he was like "oh cool its its like you! ^-^ Thats his favorite emoticon. And when we talked about the 'Wa-wa' Its like a local convenince store they have in New Jersey. And he said he'd show it to me someday and I responded with :-O on AIM, this was an IM. And he said what are you doing catching flies? and he put a pacifer in my muzzle. And I just tickled him with my nose on his tummy. Thats where he is the most ticklish.  On Aim anyway.  I just think I'm never going to find a better match then Rusty and I. The phone conversations, heh. he said he would protect me if anything happened to me. I wish I could do the same for him now. I think his contact infomation is on my new computer, but i can't boot that hard drive because this computer is'nt fast enough to support windows xp. And I wish I was'nt kicked off the internet till next month or I would sit by the computer all day and wait for him. I think i'm going to be sick. But rusty was the only one who could get me in a good mood no matter what. I could have the worst day ever and he'd come online or call and turn my frown upside down. (no pun intended).   It feels like a peice of my heart is just ripped clean out and I get tired, and sniffly and sorrow.   Its full complete sorrow, like I just want to howl. Well thats what I'm doing is howling, I'm not sure if anybody is listening or anybody can help. Because the only help I want is to know if Rusty is OK. And if he is, the sooner I can move on. 2 weeks and counting. 2 more to go. -sorry all who read this -Kit Wolf

      *Yerf* Nothing much up to today, just chill'n in class. Itchy to draw megan over there, her expressions are just, so odd. Anyway Last night I knocked out a bunch of sketches, I got one unfinished pic and one inked done, and lets just say the inked one is rather distrubing. Very disturbing. For me anyway, just random thoughts on my head, either from songs, what people say and what i say to myself. Kinda down, but i am feeling just iffy today. This morning the pilot light on the heater went out, so I froze myself when I got out of bed. myeh! I did'nt have a lighter or anything, or i would've re-lit it. Yesterday ms mcabe came to visit art 3-4/photo class. I miss her, such a kick tail teacher. But ms horonkin is nice too. Just unsure alot.  Just thought of my chinese zodiac, dragon eh? hehe odd, should be more of a wolf. But they say dragons are pretty cool. I dunno about that, looked at birthday sigh too.  so much   mombo jumbo   . . . .   I'm tired *yawn* . . . *plops on the floor*  It makes me wish we had naptime in schoolies. But noooooo you're either too old or too young or something. Talked to my bro yesterday and he told me when I was little I would never say when i'm tired unless I looked at the clock and said, "oohhh late.." heh, why can't i be like that now. Young everthings a lie at times, just like kit in my story. The lie that he was, too what he is, its a reverse role to me but its somehow the same type of feeling (but i don't know how it feels to be a killing machine) well neither does kit but he knows of his misdeeds.   Guess I feel like doing some drawings...  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

      Listening to the police right now, good band, good times. Just looking at our school spotlight and read on danielle lawrence's view on school lunch. And normally it has been taking longer to get lunch here and less time to actually eat lunch. I blame those finiky computers for one and second.......well one thing since the smaller jr high get lunch first there is mostly a shortage for the high school lunch. *grr* To remedy this effect I bring my own lunch to school now 2 PB&J Sandwitches and a bag of our detroit imported chips *murr* good good good chips!  Well, Kritter is back in the soo with Basti. Hmm BTW I wonder how Basti's proposal went to those 'big people'. Which comes to a thought of what Basti told me last sunday.  "Do you know why wolf parent's fight/play rough with their cubs" He said I responded vagley, " Nu uh..." Which brought that, "So they can grow up to be big tough wolfs too" and brought, "But somtimes Nips and growls can hurt more than expected."  And all this is true *nods nods* I played a joke on ted yesterday, I had he plushie fox and did funny pictures with my webcam and it. *hehe* like I put it in my blender and snapped a picture with a caption underneath that read "Fox shake!" He laughed very loudly. hehe  So whats new? hmmm Me and Night had a brief discussion on Gays yesterday.  Rusty should be back home on saturday, wonder if his vacation was sunny and fun. hehe    Don't sue me  urlLink Fern Blossom !   -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

      Ever just have those days where, you just ponder and realize your parent's are getting old? Today while I was buying books my mother came out to 65$ for some odd reason, so I added it  in my head three or four times and came out to 53$, and at first I was like wait I can't be right because my ma said sixtey five. So then I did it on paper two times then i finally got out the calculator to much of both our surprises. I was right. Its strange, kinda scary, (because i'm horrible in the mathmatics department). So its one of  those snowy days, I'm home sick. And its terrible. Shoveled the snow while my ma was at work then made me some eggs and pancakes hehe it was great. Level of independence but still did'nt taste like ma's. Well I'm getting some kick tail books, two in drawing portraits in pen and ink one about genetics and two in computers. Which were good deals. I'm getting this Macintosh book with a thousand pages for only six bucks! the others are like 9-16 bucks. Really cheap books but lotsa info. I can't wait :) its a christmas present to myself. And maybe I can get NIght Wolf that furry ISB comic if I get a job this winter *c'mon snow!* And maybe I'll give ted that mac book, since he just got a new emac. *drools* I wanna mac so bad. But... Thats lust and lust  ..... is Bad ........I WANT ONE! *ahem* And I dunno what to get the other ted for chirstmas, maybe i'll do a picture for him. And  jessica? Damn I dunno hmm guitar book or cdrom or something. Maybe i'll just giver a hug Hell i'll call her tonight see whats up.  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

      *yerf*  What way will our lives take? Only a few more years left and I can't help but wonder. And Thess if you stop drawing I will defidently throw a plushie at you. Thats for sure. And if you guys can only communicate through these posts, what kind of friends are we? Not very good then, eh? Its ot like i'm contagious if you open up a bit. But then again i'd be hypocritcal if I did'nt open up. Because there are chapters in my life I rather keep private. Such as babyfurs.  Ah what road will we take, its safe to say not one of us is going to 'rocket' to fame in our life time. I somtimes imagine myself making decent living money and living with Rusty. With very lazy weekends and days full of adventure. So much adventure, wheather its going to furry parties, exploring books on rainy days or learning what to teach the children and adults in my vocation teaching job. Heh, or if things go well with SAW I could improve and keep improving to hit a big animation gig. Well its good money thats for sure, with rare off days. And then we would have very smooth days at night, when we are all tired from the works days and somtimes we'd baby eachother. Play daddy some days or be cubs another and maybe we'd have a babyfur/daddy roomate. But we'd both love it, even when worrying about our finicial situation, and I'd have to pick up selling novels for minimal extra cash to publishers. IT would be.....somewhat like that. But what I imagine and what happens are two different things, I would'nt be able to live with rusty in NJ because of my college grant that might only be valid in michigan. But I know i'm going to major in either PC repair or traditional/computer animation specialist.  It'll work, and what happens to Ted, Jess, Stef and Thess? Thess might become an owner of his father's company, Ted might be working on games or even a janitorial job. Stef? I'm unsure she might be living with her rents for a while. Jess? I could see her as  a secratary. Me, unsure of. I have work potential, I'll work till the bones poke out my fingers and work until the job it done. I'll continue to expand my mind with plane, dimensional, and time therories till my head hurts of a head ache. I'll write until all thats left are the tips of my fingers on the keyboard. I'll read until my eyes completely fair and read more and more before they do fail, its a ticking clock. I'll draw and animate and act the world through characters and lines until I can't see reality and drawings anymore. Then I'll leave all my work behind to enjoy. I'll only sell comissions and stuff. Everything else is free, no prints. Prints are stupid, if you see a print its not an orignal just made to look. If its a computer copy, I want to share it. HAve people up them on their Windows longhorn desktop. Or their new Linux based server desktop :)  Who knows? Time does   *And she stands in the corner. He lips nothing but a faint line of and her eyes as soft and glazed over as if she sat by the fire place contemplating. Contemplating on why they failed, but Kit had not fail. He was far from that. And he would be rewarded. She took his hand and Kit fell to the grown, dead. Cold and silent.*  -Kit Wolf

      *yerf* Seems to me that spring has reared its young head and the weather is going to slump back into the humidiy of hell, as I call it. So it seems a friend of mine has turned babyfur. He really likes his diapies, or as our code name goes: Roger Wilcos. Thats a cool name for it and i De-juiced that you can use Roger Wilco for anything.  "Hey Bud hand me that roger wilco!"  So alot of contemplating going on, and I've fully changed the beginning of Kit again, hehe. Instead he first gets arrested for being naked in the city and goes to a city prision during those few days he sees and experiences alot which makes him very rought and chizeled, Blitz comes back when he is released (because you can't hold someone for a long time for streaking) and takes him to Ontano. Then he learns more on love and is sighted to be killed. Which leads to him moving. Then going on the Holy War adventure and to find his Identity. The plot line is starting to shape up better, thank god!  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

      *yerf* "My opinion, the furry fandom needs to loosen up"  Just don't tell anyfur that. Last night I was on IRC and I said that in the particular channel I was in. And I mentioned that opinion and I got bashed for it, well I should'nt say bash but the conversation was ended, I don't think it should've been it was in lines with the channel topic. Furries after all. Have some furs forgotten why we are all in the fandom? We all share a love for the anthropomorphic animals and for that you should'nt be prejudce against other furry lifestyles just because you may think they are sick compaired from what furry lifestyle you prefer. We should push the fandom more to evolutionary then hold it back because you're prejudce. I came to the assumption, I was not wrong or out of line in anyway, but I still stopped the discussion, which was not a discussion but more of an opinion. I don't like to cause trouble, not for anyfur but some things have to be discussed. No matter if you're a LF, Babyfur, yiffy, theriomorph, Lycan, were or anything else.   Why do we have these predjuce ways? Just because some babyfur left a diaper at anthrocon, or some yiffy guy stalked some underage furry. Anyone is wrong for those things. You don't have to associate with those people/furs. Keep it in private I say. I usually don't tell anyone i'm a babyfur until they ask directly, otherwise i'm as normal as any other fur. But then again which of us furs liked to be 'normal?' This really is'nt a deep thought of this but its somthing that bothered me in the fandom. Being careful and open in the fandom works the best.  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

      *yerf* Just sitting around FTPing files back and forth between servers....too bad I forgot my password for my new site. And this time I hope the PHP scripts work :P Talked to a bit of people this week. Oh! and I made 30 bucks raking Sue Kemp's Lawn....It was sweet. Well I did'nt sleep last night, partly because I was scared of another bad dream and partly because I must've had a fever or something. I'm tired now. 0 hours of sleep. *yawn* talked to rusty a few nights ago, and I think we've had a break through. Hehe its now fairly easy to share anything I say with him. We were talking about 'taking it up the tailhole' hehe not that graphic though. But it was great. And he said he was releived because he think I did'nt even think about sex....oh, theres that naughty word. And we talked about past realationships, before me he used to be mated with someone else. And then that someone dumped him, erf. I know for sure I won't do anyting like that, I love him too much.  He's great, the way he talks, the way he looks, the way he acts. So sweet. And then there's me, not much of a prize, but he seems to go nuts for me. And i'm ugly, wow. I wish I was hansome, or atleast wish I looked younger.

      *yerf*  Something interesting happened yesterday, this person signed on and said he read my blog. He was an AB of course. And he was really nice. And kind to talk to. Was pretty fun. We sat talking about furries and diapers for a while. And art. And then I sat around with Night as we talked for a while. I think I embarassed her. I find the different view we have a warped by society. Some people's view are ew I don't want children. And others such as myself think of it like a ritual, reserved, for the person you love :). But then its odd. Hetero people can make life, so amazing, still amazes me but Homo's can't. Its in a way, not sad because of overpopulation but its ......well ok it is sad. But with massive overpopulation people might stay to being gay or most may take the alternative route and get fixed. Fixing happens in KIT : A NEW BEGINNING. But only in heavly populated cities and Tar'le. Hence why Taro cannot have children and takes in Blaze *sniffle* so much love.  Well listening to the furry music foundation music. Man some of this stuff is awesome. You could easily fit these to movie themes. Only needs a lil retuning. Good music though. *gets up and dances*  Feeling oddly run down these past few days. I should plan on getting more sleep.  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf

      My HORO  Quickie: This isn't about battle. You'd win anyway. Put the whole thing behind you. Move on.  Overview: Oddly enough, you'll be cooperative, eager to please and perfectly willing to compromise. Offer your current flame or your prospective one a nice back rub -- to help them get over the shock.  extended forecast: It's Monday and you're all over the map. You respond to every stimulus, whether or not it has anything to do with you. Stay focused on the task at hand. If you can't, maybe it's because your hard-driving nature is getting a touch of egalitarian gentleness from the stars. You're confused by competing desires for effort and comfort. All things are still being considered long past the point where you'd usually make your snap decision. You shouldn't have any trouble getting what you want. The challenge lies in knowing what that is. You might even follow someone who has a clue about this.   *yerf* So I suppose thess isn't speaking to me. I shouldn't say hell with him but that is rather rude. Me and Stef....Or should I say Stef and I? I have a hard time with those differences. Wow, I'm boring.  I've been to haste the past few days and things aren't coming out right, I should set more time to draw and prepare for school. Ick, being a teen blows.  Gotta finish my geometry too, I'll finish studying later in lunch time. *blinks at his tummy growling* mmm tummy sounds , I'm hungry.  And as much as I hate to admit it, I miss Andre. Desi and Jens called me yesterday jeans and I talked for a long time and desk and I didn't have much to say to eachother.   I got a 52 piece PC kit, a big big pillow :) and just money and crappy sweaters! SWEATERS IN SPRING!  I had a dream about persona *laughs* it was atta canyon type thing and the wolves were fighting against the church. I was the wind swordsman. It was strange. The wolves kept telling me I was small and weak and I would die in the 'first leg' of this battle but then I said "I fight for those whom cannot protect, I fight for the bitterness of the world. I fight for the selflessness of everyone else." The lead wolf huffed and drew up his massive sword. He was 3 times my height and savage, then the battle begun. And I was fighting another wind swordsman. I had to use a persona speed card to kill him. It was crazy. We both fought in fast speed. And then after I killed him I had a limited amount of magic I could cast with cards because I was fairly tired.  But in my persona write ups persona magic cards don't drain energy. So the dream made no sense. It was very vivid, I could taste the snow when I fell and staggered. I'm sure I jerked quite a bit in bad half dreaming.  The moist air of the wolves breathing. It was so...scary. I must admit. I was frightened the whole time.  Time's going on, and I'm bored....  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit wolf

      *yerf* I've been thinking constantly today. Rusty and I talked last night and some stuff came up. He said lets not call each other  mates  until we have offically met up. Which I said it would probably never happen and more than likely we'll never be together. He told me not to think like that. I can't really help myself. I like him alot. He's different. Not strange. Just like a car with that 'new car' smell. But it never goes away. A breath of sweet air, not stale, not bitter, not air at all, really. When I just think about him I can feel like nothing makes me exist. I don't need anything but him to live. Strange how that works out. I'm determined to be with him but so many people like him more than me. And the chances grow slim that he'll want to be with me after X amount of years waiting and waiting. I feel as though, I should stop thinking about him and move on. But even then more than likely we'll remain really close. Even if we do remain close and never get together I'll still love him. Almost like an unhealthy facination. I talk one of my friends ear off constantly. He's great but I guess I should'nt get involved anymore. Its confusing. I'm such an Internet Whore!  Last night I scolded myself for being so stupid. Stupid, to think somone would wait for me for years until we're together. Then again he has a life he has to live and I do as well. I should focus more on living and life right now and get out of this pity relationship. Focus on work now instead of sceaming ways of which I can meet and stay with him.   Today was uneventful. I did my speech with my computer in speech class and I had to show off the Custom Snow Brush I made and I got cut off. Over 15min. But i'm happy got it done. Nothing to sweat over in that class, even if that class was a extreamly easy peice of cake. Cheese Cake even.   Exams next week.  *wurf*  -warm wolf cub hugs -Kit Wolf

      *yerf* Have you ever came across something so sad that it makes you scared to grow up? I worked at Konetka friday, along with krystal whom was dishwashing. Man she kicks butt as a worker, rose and her mother kinda suck, but they are nice. Just a lil lazy. Man I wish I worked with Krystal more often. But I would like it if that one cute guy came back, my savior. Even if his family did screw my mom out of her car, oh that pisses me off. Sorry sweared again!  The story was my mom's car got rear ended by this guys' plow. And then he called my mom and said it was totalled, middle of winter and the car won't start! He said to call someone to replace it or the guy can pay a bit to get it towed, what happens the next day? Car was NOT rear ended and my mom legally signed offer everything to the guy. Car was in perfect condition! Oh did that piss me off. It was a crystler new yorker, freaking nice car too!  Well oh yea, the as thing. These three old people came to eat at Konteka. When they left one guy went to pay and the old man and this really old lady started to walk out. and this guy dragged her by the arm, she had to use a cane but tried to keep pace until she collapsed in the hall way. Kara helped her up along with the other old gentalman that was paying but the next thing this guy that started swearing to her as she was down on the floor "Aw what the hell, you're never gonna get any faster. You're so useless!"  It was so sad, so raw.  I hope I don't end up useless when I'm old.   Well can't think much anymore, I hardly write anymore, I should change that.

      *yerf* Safe to say don't cheat, especially when you have a person thats good at tracking files over the web, my theory is the mail servers punch a tag through what server the file passes through. ERK so dave is going to get a zero on that one assigment and so do I, which i'm sorry dave! I can make it up somehow i'm sure, but oh well. So i'm hoping he takes the zero, if he does'nt i'm kicked out of computer apps, zero tolerance on cheating...   I've had HTML on the brain.... MR. Kolbus showed me some awesome hardware, removable IDE drives, and he's getting an AMD MP board to use as a server, can you say.....BIG BOOST IN NETWORK SPEED? Thats cool. I hope I can get in comp repair, I also should talk to Kolbus about hooking up my demo pc to do my demo in mr Uotila's.  Well my work is piling up but i'm doing ok, grade is rising in geometery, english is an A, bio is either a c or b, web design is going well, my own personal site is not going well, FTP problems a plenty. I'm still having problems finding Linux drivers for a geforce 4 mx4000 video card, not to say it performs bad but with a geforce driver it would preform so much better! I don't use Linux all that much. I have to get a program called VideoLAN to play DVD vobs, since there are no dvd codecs for linux yet...RPM packages are nice in linux, way better than windows .exe installers and the speed of linux, especially navigating the file system in Konquerer, its sad my modem does'nt work properlly, but I can get an external one that will be fully compataible.

Wuffs are cuter diapered.  3. Boring out here in the sticks.  4. I hate reading journals but somtimes I will.  5. I'm more broke with my car.  6. Deus Ex 2 is freaking awesome!  7. The snow is coming down on our new england town .....Wait I just trailed off there, sorry all. Well Its been forever since I updated this crummy thing of a blog and someone did ask me "How is furry life" and now I should say its suck-tastic! Still same messed up problems i have in relationships, this weird foxxie fur likes me, erp. Well he bothers me less now, thank god! Storm and I have been having alot of late night talks about everything you can imagine, heh, he's somtimes as lonely as I am, though he's probably one of the nicest furs along with Basti, guess thats why storm is our daddy ;P heh most of da time. Rusty has been unsually busy, *paw slaps himself* and I know its not good to be this hmm??? all the time over a guy I can't even see often...why does it have to be thousand miles away? Oh well, so drawing i've been doing only like every other day, nothing good really, i'm so rusty. I'm finishing up coloring a character trade I did with Tails Corra. or w/e his name is he has alot of them. I somtimes hate how furs make this weird freaking fantasy adventure stories of how their character came to be. I just consider Kit Wolf just to be me heh well a 2 year old anthro, but he's still me, there's no really split identity difference, we're the same :P Confusing I know but thats how this fandom is somtimes.   So stef has been pretty lonely ever since Ted Hess left back to downstate land, another troll under the bridge, even for how annoying he is he was a really good guy to have around, kinda goofy and goony but nice.  So ordered some diapers from xpmedical.com got some more abena abriforms the old kind, hehe they are suppose to be like an inch thick! which is gonna be awesome, wish I had more money or i'd stock up.

Well I guess most furs are considering we do find eachother on furnet and things like that, gotta have atleast some skill. Even though programs like trillian makes things alot easier to connect, still gotta know the server address. .Net passports are one of the most annoying things ever...THANK YOU MICROSOFT! And I still think my lsass.exe file on windows xp is corrupt from the sasser virus. It attacks only lsass.exe anyway. *grr*  I'll ask Mr. Kolbus today. I'm thinking I can install a new windows on a hard drive and just copy over lsass, but then i'd have to patch the lsass.exe file again.  I'm surprised how distant, us yooperfurs have all grown. But i'll still get my golf game with kritter and maybe see Sii sometime. Its a shame.

July has been an adventure full of html php scripting and also garage sales and friends scared of loud booms! Jessica and I saw the fireworks on july 3, it was sad that no one else came, but It did help me get over my lonelyness. I've been meeting alot of furs online lately as well, many of the fellow babyfurs who are quiet in the babyfurs Channel. Diapered got all up after kit silver fox just after some stupid one line of text were kit gently grabbed the scruff of diaperds neck. Well I had a problem with him once and even snuggems came after me for it. The yerf comment. Just because diapered was'nt accepted into yerf.com he hates anyone affiliated with them, including me. Such a prick he is.   Well ok who i ment, I've met Kimba fellow babyfur from Europe, maybe i'll see him soon, he seems to love the idea of Austria being more country side then Holland where he lives. Very urban place.  BabyTiger I met, a really really nice fur. He's been around for a while. And he's really nice. He works as a stage crew for movies, and even worked with bands like april wine. HE's really cool.  SH is another face I met, new to furries and really nice. Though he keeps sending me   Well i'm still Single boys ! ;P  Furryteens has been donig good, finally a whole year has passed since i created it on july 2nd 2003   So Anthrocon starts on thursday.
