       Well, Monday was the doctor's appointment. I had to get an endometrial biopsy. That was an awful experience! If someone says you need one run in the opposite direction as fast as you can. (However you should get one done if they tell you that you need one).  Let me explain to everyone what is involved in this "somewhat" painful procedure. (That's a quote from my GYN). They stick this tiny tube, which they show you and you think oh that won't hurt, into your vagina and into your uterus. That's where my fun began. Apparently, I have a tilted uterus so they had to take it out and reinsert it. This causes your uterus to cramp up. They say it feels like your having a contraction. I wouldn't know since I have not had any children . Then they tell you "this is when your cramping will start". At which point I was like it gets worse!! Then a little needle pinch tool pinches you 10 times. This is when my butt came off of the table. They did that 3 times with breaks in between. I thought I was going to die. I almost passed out from the pain!  At least it's over now! Just waiting on the results!!

       Well, today is the big day. For my husband, John, anyway. Today is the opening day for his trucking company. For those of you who don't know John recently bought into a trucking company. It's one that will be used to transport cars. They have 3 trucks so far and about 5 year contracts with local delearships.  It's a different turn for him. He has been in the car business for 11 years and this is related, a little,  it's still very different. I was able to go see two of the trucks on Saturday. One had just arrived. They are both in great condition. I really hope everything works out well.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  I am so happy that I ended up with such an intelligent man with a drive that is so hard to find. I am so proud of him for everything that he has already accomplished at such a young age. Who would think that at the age of 27 and 28 we have already reached the point of not having to worry about money. If we want to do something we do it.  Most young people are not so fortunate.  John believes we will be a millionaires by the time he is 35 and I truly believe him.  Here's  to the future.

       This weekend was my High School's 10 year reunion. I must admit in some weird way I was looking forward to this event. I question my reasons why now.  I am very glad that I did attend because I met a very cool new friend. Jennifer and I never hung out in school. I guess we traveled different circles, but now we have so much in common that it's scary funny. It is her website that inspired me to start this blog. So, thanks to her the reunion was not a total bust.  Friday night was the informal get together at Cafe Cabernet. A lot of familiar faces and a few I was happy to see. (Julie T., Jennifer S.) But, all my friends that I was close with (there were many) were absent. Only a select few of the entire class were present. I saw Jennifer and we started talking and found ourselves enjoying each others company. Our husbands seem to have a lot in common too.  So, it's all good.       So, anyway ....      Long story short our formal cocktail party that was planned for Saturday night was cancelled due to lack of interest. So, a picnic at 11am on Saturday was the "BIG" event. I must admit I did feel a bit sorry for the class president Brandea. You can tell that she did really try - being long distance and pregnant must not have helped any. She had about 100 invites returned.     So the picnic was the same people from the night before. With a couple more faces I was happy to see. Shane, April, Donna, Jennifer S and of course Jennifer I am glad they were there. The numbers and emails were exchanged. I do hope we keep in touch.     The conclusion of my rambling......    I was left feeling empty. All my close friends whom I've lost contact with will have to continue to be happy memories of the high school years. Who knows .. Maybe it's better this way.    I am happy that a new friend has entered my life.
