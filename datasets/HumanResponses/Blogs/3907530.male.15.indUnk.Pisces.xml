You got a phone, pick it up, call me  [Chorus: Eminem]  How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now After all the years we been down Aint no way no how, this bullshit can be true We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you  [Verse 1: Eminem] So young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit When ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on Tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it You even had the same type of childhood i did Sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours And mine i survived it, you ran the streets, i 9 to 5'd it We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then i blew up To both yours and mine surprises Now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it As much as your pride tries to hide it Your cold, you touch its like ice In your eyes is the look of resenment I can sense it, and i dont like it  [Chorus]  [Verse 2: Kon Artis]  It was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse On my own album with a deal but shit got burst So i came out i woulda killed a nigga first Before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste Some bitch that i wasnt with i would hit her then quit But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit I told you dont get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her Comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk Like yall was husband and wife or somethin But me catchin you fuckin other niggers musta hurt you pride or somethin Cuz you wont fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me When all i tried to do was show your bitch was shifty And ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced You actin like i aint you man and lyin like she can't be loose But i am really you friend, i'm jus trying to tell you the truth But dont hate the game or the player Cuz the one that is changing is you  [Chorus]  [Verse 3: Proof]  You're only at the top cuz my homie had to stop Now we actin like i gotta live only for the block Homies in the hood only she be on the tube Only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who Fools i used to rap with all expect magic Like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it jus happen But PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned Shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends Whenever real intelligence thats forever till the end I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives And wastin my times with these snakes in disguise (how come) when you talk its with bitter is fight And (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life And everytime i go to hear you and play you look away We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.  [Chorus]   -TsuMlaKeRs88-

      my life just wet from heaven to hell. I met Jenny at a x-mas party this last christmas, but i was to shy to talk to her at the time. i also realized l8r she had a bf. my brother happened to get her sn, so we kept in contact over the second semester of school. we finally got back together in june. the first day i say her again i was so nervous i didnt kno wut to say. but eventually i got over it. 2 days l8r i went to her house. that was the best day ever. we made out on her front porch for like 10 min. i will always remember that day. i saw her again 2 days l8r, and we had to go to this kart ranch b cuz i dont have a car and i was at my aunts house w/my 2 little cousins. Then i saw her for one more time on saturday and we had a pretty good time.i didnt see for a while because we had to go bak home, then go bak to lafayette so we could go to florida for a week. that was pretty fun to make it short. we then went bak to lafayette and stayed there a few days( jenny lives in new iberia which is about 30 minutes away from lafayette, and this is in louisiana for u people who dont kno where these towns r located) I saw her the day after we got bak and we kised some more, but as usual it is hard to do ne thing b cuz u dont kno when my aunt or little cousins will barge in. but we still had fun. then i was suppose to see her on saturday, 7/3/04, but her mom called 30 minutes after she had just said she could go. i was really mad b cuz i wanted to see her one more time b4 i had to go bak 2 austin. well this is where it becomes hell... one week l8r, after coming bak fromt he movie "White Chicks", which by the way was a funny movie, go see if it if u havent, i saw that jenny's sn was on. well i started talking to her, but it was her friend laura. she was tlking about this guy she liked, then she said there was this othre guy with her and jenny was there 2. and just guess what happened? they started making out. i was so fuckin pissed. we acualy never went out officially, but we made out 4 times, and i check her info on her sn, and she this guy was a great kisser, but she never put that i was a great kisser in her info, and 2 days ago, she asked me if she was a good kisser, and she also said that i was a great kisser. i dont get it. i felt like a one night stand in a way. like i was there just for a certain time. i felt betrayed in a way as well. i kno we live far away and all, but she didnt have to do that. u dont want to even kno the things i called her when i found out about that. i still havent tlked to her yet, her friend told me about it. i love her, but idk wuts going to happen, well, ill post l8r, im out  -TsuMlAkerS88-
