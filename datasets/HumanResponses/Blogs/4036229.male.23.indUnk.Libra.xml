						       I have heard a lot of people complain about everything from "reality" TV shows to what gets covered on the news and what doesn't.  They seem to blame the media for the current state of our "TV land."  It is all a giant conspiracy by giant corporations to either numb our minds or turn us into "good little zombies" who buy all the right products and so forth.      I believe that there has been some confusion as to what is the cause and what is the effect.  Amazingly, simple logic can be applied to prove my point.  I shall avoid modern scientific method, as it may give results I don't like.  Instead, I am going to use the old tried-and-true equation of a+b=x, where "x" is "whatever I have already concluded."      Let's consider what the main objective is of those who run media outlets.  I think we can all agree that their primary concern on the corporate level--stemming from the same concern on personal levels--is to make money.  This is fine.  We are in a capitalist system, and that is how capitalist systems work.  This desire for profit is represented by "a" in the equation.      The amount of money that is made by broadcasters is directly linked to the number of people who watch their programs.  This is commonly known as the "ratings system."  Therefore, in order to increase the amount of money they make, they need to increase public interest in their programming.  Public interest is represented by "b" in the equation.      One recent phenomenon is the dramatic increase in what is called "reality TV."  Though this type of show is not necessarily all that new--I think most are just suped-up game shows anyway--their numbers have increased exponentially in recent times.  This has often been tracked back to the success of "Survivor," and the scrambling by broadcasters to reproduce that success.  Therefore, a+b=x, where "x" is broadcasts that are exactly what the American public wants to see.  Now I make my tremendous leap:      This all leads me to believe that the reason the subject of who won American Idol will get leading coverage on CNN while a horrible accident that killed hundreds in a foreign country is at most a small blurb on the news ticker at the bottom of the screen is because the statistics CNN has in their hands show that most Americans don't care about other countries and such things that "don't directly effect our lives," but take incredible interest in the tiniest details about celebrities they will never meet.  Simply put, you get what you ask for in a "supply and demand" world.      So, take a look around your world, and think to yourself, "Is this what I asked for?"  If not, then maybe you should ask a little louder next time.

						       Well, it's late, I'm tired, and I have to go to Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, in the morning, so I will delay for now the writing of a profile or posting of a picture, but feel the responsibility to at least explain myself a little.      I am a "nobody," an "anybody" and a sometimes purveyor of personal opinion and conjecture thinly disguised as common sense.  I believe in peace, and that with too much of it all progress and purpose in life would end.  I hate war, and understand that conflict is an integral part of our lives and universe.  I prefer understanding, and realize that it will not gain worldwide acceptance in my lifetime.      I believe in the "cigarette on a line" theorem: in the expanse of infinity, everything is of equal importance.  In other words, whether you treat that cashier at the grocery with common human courtesy is just as important as whether or not some world leader presses a button that destroys the entire human race.  In the end, each event is just a tiny dot on the line of infinity; each equally insignificant, and each incomprehensibly important.  Hard to swallow?  Well then, call it a Horse Pill.      I don't care if you agree with what I have to say, in fact, I'd prefer you didn't, because then I can continue to pretend that I am truly unique and important, and I love servicing my ego as much as the next man.      So, to at least have some kind of point in this post, I leave you with this thought:  In the current election, wouldn't it be nice if someone pulled a "Brewster's Millions" stunt and ran a campaign recommending that we elect "None of the above"?  Neither Kerry nor Bush is a "leader;" I would recommend to no child to look to either of them as a role model.  However, America, you get what you ask for.  The Democrats asked for "Anybody but Bush," and Kerry certainly fulfills every bullet point on that highly selective check list... of course, so does Jerry Springer, and so would Hitler.  My hat is off to the Democrats.  I never thought they could make me pine for a presidential bid by Hillary Clinton, and yet, here we are.

						   I have recently read of the actions taken by Muqtada al-Sadr's followers.  The names of towns I have seen--Najaf, Nasiryah, Al-Kut--these are places that my friends and I have numerous stories from.  The town closest to my own heart, one not mentioned in recent articles, but talked of in past confrontations, is Kerbala.  It is second only to Najaf in it's prominence for Shi'ite Islam.  I remember Kerbala because it was so peaceful in my time there.  I remember patrols that involved Marines handing out soccer balls and stopping to shake hands with smiling adults and children.  I remember walking out in the street with a translator, wearing only my uniform and soft cap, and carrying only my rifle and one 30-round magazine.  I also remember the only time there was much of any concern for the safety of anyone in that city, Iraqi or American alike.  That was the day a handful of Sadr's followers marched through the street, chanting and doing the best they could to rouse some kind of violence out of U.S. soldier and Marines and Iraqi police, waving rusty, pathetic knives in the air.  True to training and code, we stood by and let them march, doing nothing to interfere, but making it quite clear that any violence would be met with violence.  Since that day, back in late 2003, many things have changed in Iraq.  Overestimating the willingness of European soldiers to keep the peace in a foreign country, we handed over security of the peaceful South to them.  Taking advantage of the good and honorable people of that region, and using a thin guise of religious activism to meet his own aspirations of power, Sadr has gathered all that he can to him, and repeatedly sought conflict with those who want nothing more than a just peace for the Shi'ite people.  I recall in Kerbala how a cleric praised the Americans for their sensitivity to the two shrines there.  He talked of how we would not approach the shrines with our weapons, of how in the shadows of the holy places we lowered our weapons--an act that ran counter to the lack of respect that had often been shown by Saddam's men.  We were told that any American who was Muslim would, of course, be welcome at the holy shrines, that the only action that was unacceptable was for anyone--regardless faith--to approach them armed.  These things are in my mind now as Sadr, an opportunist of the worst sort, continues to use Islam as a curtain behind which to hide.  I think of his armed followers and the incredible disrespect they have shown to the holy sites, and I cannot help but wonder if anyone who takes up arms against such as these and seeks to drive them from their disgraceful occupation of the holy sites should not be revered as heroes of Islam.  These men have used holy sites as arsenals, have sought to bring ruin and destruction to their neighbors and communities, and the only possible goal to be achieved by their action is prominence and power for Sadr.  I do not ask the Shi'ites to accept without question the American occupation, I do not ask them to accept Allawi or the interim government either.  I only ask that they examine Sadr, so that they may come to realize he is a false teacher whose only motives are power.  If they wish autonomy for the South, then seek it, and I only hope that they will realize there are more effective and peaceful means by which to seek it.  However, do not seek it under the leadership of such as Sadr, a blasphemer who would spit on the very name of Allah in his own pursuit of worldly gain.

						   Here's some old-new news: the add by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth opposing John Kerry's bid for president.  It's caused at least a little controversy, been mentioned on Meet the Press and numerous other shows, been the subject of lots of e-mails, and I'm sure more than a few water-cooler debates.  My own first reaction upon hearing of the add and viewing it online, was to "Google" the name of the organization in question and check out their official web site at www.swiftvets.com.  The more that I encounter this subject in the news and daily conversations, the more I begin to believe that I am one of the few people to try this approach.  My first issue is with Sen. John McCain.  He has called the add "dishonest and dishonorable," as you may have read many times in numerous articles.  I have a certain respect for Sen. McCain, but not for his choice of words in this circumstance.  After a thorough examination of the group’s web site, I can see an argument for saying that the add is misleading in some places, but I find it neither dishonest, nor in any way dishonorable.  I believe Sen. McCain may have any number of reasons for the vehemence of his response to this add, and he is certainly entitled to his opinion, but I do not believe that he really examined the situation fully.  My second issue is with those who have attacked the group as a front for Republicans trying to undermine Kerry.  The group is indisputably backed by people affiliated with the Republican party.  I do not question that; I don't think anyone can.  That those backers have their own reasons and personal vendettas is a definite possibility.  Ultimately though, when one examines those involved, one finds that there are old relationships at play here that, though partisan in their own way, transcend party politics.  Case in point: John O'Neill.  O'Neill is a member of the "steering committee" for the organization, and has a statement on the web site that closely echoes the sentiments he pronounced over thirty years ago on The Dick Cavett Show in a debate with Kerry.  The manuscript of the show is available on the web site, conveniently enough.  Unlike most of those in the add, O'Neill is not taking issue with Kerry's awards, but rather with his actions upon returning to the United States.  This is not surprising, since it was what O'Neill was doing in the debate over thirty-three years ago.  In fact, many of those featured on the site seem to take issue with Kerry over what they view as not just a betrayal, but a very personal betrayal.  The issues I see at play are ones that cut into old wounds and bring out incredibly deep emotions for those involved.  It is a bit of personal opinion, but I believe that the those involved in the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth would oppose Kerry regardless of who he was running against or what his party affiliation was.  I ask you to do a little exercise with me: imagine in your mind someone who has personally hurt you or a loved one.  Imagine the person for whom you would have the least human compassion in this world; the person that if you saw them on the street you'd have to suppress overwhelming rage.  Now, imagine that person is running for President of the United States of America, and imagine your reaction.  Now realize that unless you have actually served in combat with others--been asked to put your life and everything dear to you in the hands of another based only on the affiliation provided by your uniform and common fate--that you can not even begin to imagine how these men feel.  Regardless of whether Kerry betrayed them or not--an issue I feel no authority to tackle and would rather leave to the Vietnam Veterans to decide amongst themselves--does not matter in the formation of personal opinions.  They felt betrayed by him, more deeply so than most people can imagine, and in the formation of their opinions of him, that is all that will matter.  I am not claiming that all of their claims are just or valid.  I am not claiming that the TV add is in good taste.  However I do believe that the organization's web site makes several valid points, and I am honestly, personally, of the opinion that Kerry's own flaunting of his war record has been in less than good taste, but that is a subject unto itself.  Many of my own opinions of Kerry, I admit, are personal in nature, and include elements ranging from people he reminds me of during my own time in service in a foreign country during an undeclared war, to his inability to at least show an iota of military bearing when he did his disgraceful impersonation of a salute on national television during the Democratic National Convention.  These are things from my own background and experiences that many of you will not understand.  For most, the salute thing may seem trivial, but to me, because of my experience, it is a reflection of character and discipline.  We are each shaped by our backgrounds and experiences, and that, in-turn, shapes our opinions and approaches to the world.  What I advocate in regard to this issue is that people take the time to review the web site www.swiftvets.com, take the time to look over both the explanations of things like FITREPs and the actual documentation, take the time to visit www.johnkerry.com and get his side, take the time to do whatever other research they can, and then, finally, make the best effort possible to see things from every angle, transcend personal prejudice, and form an educated opinion.  I know, an American voter with an educated opinion may be an entirely new concept, but it might just work.  Last of all, I think that the overall debate raised by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth should be left to the Veterans.  Though I will form my own opinions and and they will be influenced by the evidence that both sides have provided, I am not going to try to say who is right or wrong in the overall debate when the argument itself is older than I am, and when the men involved are those I feel humbled in the presence of.  So, learn a little (that means probing an issue more deeply than just finding evidence for your pre-formed opinion and going "Aha! Aha! Just like I thought!"), think a little (just a little, don't strain yourselves, and take plenty of breaks--I know I had to), and then, if, after all of that, you honestly believe one of the candidates running this year in any way represents you, be my guest and go on and vote.  Of course, if you're like most Americans, you'll end up voting for the one you dislike the least, or the one you think lies less, but remember, it could be worse.  We could have a one-party system and be without the reassuring illusion of choice.  At least we still have that.  Oh, and feel free to ignore smart-mouthed, opinionated 23 year-olds who prefer cynicism and criticism to real action, and feel the need to share all of that bright sunshine with the world.

						   	My fellow Americans, it is time that we face the issues before us.  There is a great deal of name-calling and petty partisan bickering taking place on a regular basis in our political processes these days, while the real issues are tossed aside like unwanted stepchildren.  I, for one, am here to speak for those unwanted stepchildren, cruelly shoved into the cold, dark, mildew-streaked basement of obscurity by limelight loving partisans like my esteemed opponent.  	We are a great nation, with a great history, and capable of great things.  I want to lead our country, not into economic chaos and international scorn, but into a great future with great accomplishments and a great image at home and abroad.  We have been great, we are great, and if elected, I will make sure that we remain great!  It’s going to be great!  	I want to reach across the aisles in congress and build bipartisan understanding and cooperation.  When elected, I will meet with members of both parties and hammer out legislation that we can all agree on and that will do as much as possible to ensure the reelection of all those concerned.  I will seek to bring economic prosperity and opportunities  to all Americans, regardless who they are and how many electoral votes their state may be able to offer me.  	On the international scene, I will strive to build good relations with those nations that are friendly to us, or that large American corporations have a substantial interest in.  I will seek to build a reputation with our allies that is positive and benefits us in future dealings within the international community.  	I will take a stern attitude towards nations that ignore the basic human rights of their citizenry, unless those countries are too big to pick on.  However, I assure you that any small, poor, third-world country that steps out of line will be swiftly and strongly reprimanded, and that the people being oppressed by tyrannical leaders--who came to power with our help--will be punished by crushing economic sanctions.  I will avoid the use of our military might, and not put our military men and women into harms way unless I am absolutely sure that there is no other choice, we can win the war in under a month, and that there will be no ongoing security situation that might put my reelection at risk.  	I see no reason why in our country children should go to bed at night hungry, and if elected, I will begin immediate efforts to have my “milk and cookies for kiddies” program brought before Congress, and I will not cease in my efforts to have this legislation approved until it is passed, or the American people are distracted by something, such as “sweeps week” or a ball of yarn, and I can just let it fall by the wayside.  	I will not allow the tax burden to be shifted to the hardworking, average American.  We need a tax plan that makes sense and is fair to all Americans.  	When I am elected president, I will select cabinet members who know things about the area in which they are supposed to know what they are doing about stuff.  This means that I will give most of the positions to friends and prominent people from within my party, and two or three cabinet positions I don’t really care about to token minorities.  	Health care is an issue that has been all but ignored by my opponent.  When elected president, I will do all that is in my power to encourage research to eliminate the threat of disease, which claims many lives every year in our great country.  I will take steps to make sure that Americans who need to see a doctor can see a doctor.  I will fight to eliminate the power of certain special interest groups, as is with keeping with the interests of special interest groups that support me.  	It is time that there was a voice for the future in our country, and I am that voice.  I don’t want to exclude people who don’t believe the same things I do, as my opponent is so fond of, but rather, I want to bring all of America together, under one banner, my banner.  	This election year, America, you have a choice.  You can choose things the way they are--choose to continue doing things the way they’ve always been done--or you can choose a slightly different alternative that at least looks different on the surface.  The choice is clear: an old, rich white guy, or an old, rich white guy.  	I am not like my opponent.  I look different, have a different voice, and come from a different part of the country.  The positions I declare now with complete conviction that I will later abandon for less-controversial and more personally beneficial alternatives are very different from the positions my opponent now declares with complete conviction and that he would abandon for the exact same set of less-controversial and more personally beneficial alternatives.  	Once again, America, your choice is clear: a great future full of great things for this great country; or economic chaos, joblessness, anarchy, wild animals roaming the streets, child molesters teaching your children, illiteracy, unfair tax policies, criminals roaming free, and diaper rash: what you don’t know could be putting your children at unnecessary risk, tonight at eleven.  	Choose greatness; choose the future; choose a country you will be proud to hand to your children someday; choose me.

						   I wonder at a lot of things I see everyday.  I find a lot of things just strike me in the wrong way.  This occurred to me today in line at the grocery store.  What exactly is it with the little dividers that people put on the belt between their groceries?  I can sort of understand when you have two people with piles of groceries almost overflowing into each other, but in my case, I rarely have more than maybe a dozen items.  I get things like store-brand sandwich meats and store-brand bread, and maybe some deodorant or shampoo.  My selections virtually scream "bachelor."  So, why when I am in line behind a middle-aged housewife, and there is plenty of room on the belt, and I set my items a full foot behind hers, does she feel the urgent need to snatch-up a divider and place it between my powdered Gatorade and her Pampers?  On the occasion that people don't feel the need to put down one of the dividers, I've seen the cashier ask, "The rest of these aren't yours, right?" and that seems to work just fine.  It's not even really the divider that gets me, it's the fearful urgency with which it is placed, and the way that the person always seems to avoid eye-contact.  Maybe they're just afraid of having to converse with the cashier anymore than is absolutely necessary... I don't know.  I guess the need to vehemently declare a division in items is not a social trend to create great concern, but there is something kind of antisocial that I see in that compulsion that makes me think of a lot of other things.  It reminds me of when I pass someone walking on the street.  I always give some kind of greeting, like "Morning," or "Afternoon," or something like that accompanied by a nod of the head and a smile.  Sometimes I get a "deer in the headlights" look, sometimes just a fearful glance before the person looks the other way as if they were deeply engaged by the surrounding architecture.  Every once in a great while someone returns my greeting in some small way... usually someone who is elderly or of the blue-collar variety.  I've noticed on Ohio State campus that proffering a greeting to a student will usually not even gain acknowledgment of your existence, but the same offered toward a foreign student or one of the many construction workers might be the beginning of a conversation, or even a friendship.  So, why are people so afraid of contact with other humans, especially strangers?  All the time people complain about feeling lonely, separated and disillusioned, but they are always surrounded by untold numbers of others who feel the same way... that doesn't even make sense.  I don't know; I don't understand it.  Maybe the death of things like common courtesy isn't really that big of a deal; maybe people are less afraid of each other than I think.  What I do know is that I'm going to continue doing my thing regardless.  I'm going to continue offering help to stranded motorists, and continue giving casual greetings to strangers on the street, and continue stopping to hold the door for women or for anyone with their arms full.  I'm going to keep smiling at random people, and keep leaving myself open to opportunities to make friends in odd places and at odd times.  I'm going to keep doing that, because it feels good, and because the one time out of a hundred someone smiles back makes all the lack of courtesy everyone else shows pale in comparison.  That is all I need to know.
