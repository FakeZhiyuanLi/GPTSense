           Pre-emption and unilateralism are morally neutral concepts: only the cause or actors in question can be just or unjust.  Despite wishful thinking to the contrary, these international strategic lessons are true across partisan lines and throughout history.  The influence of the anti-war coalition on the current presidential campaign offers rhetoric that only obscures this fact, leaving the Democratic platform an uncertain blend of hawkish and dovish ideas.  By retrospectively wavering in his support for the Iraq War,  urlLink pleading  ignorance about President Bush’s confrontational intentions, Senator John Kerry provides little clear vision of national security policy.  Ideology, even a composite of ideologies, cannot unmake the responsibilities of the commander in chief of the world’s foremost superpower.  It can, however, surely confuse and delay the inevitable recognition of the need for a militarily active United States.       Contrary to the opposition cry that the Bush Doctrine is unprecedented, pre-emptive strategies in warfare are as old as the hills.  Decisive early military action has been employed from Ancient Greece to the 1962 blockade of Cuba, the Six Day War and the invasion of Grenada.  In each of these cases, a democracy challenged a despotic opponent's sovereign territory where enemy actions had been allowed to escalate unchecked for some time.  In that sense, calling them "pre-emptive" is something of a misnomer or misconception: it ignores earlier events of a menacing nature in an artificial scenario that acknowledges only the present and future, not the past.         We need to dispel not just the mythology of pre-emptive actions, but also the crude equivalence of multilateralism and progress.  When the Americans and other once and future Allies signed a 1928 treaty outlawing all war (along with temporarily democratic Germany, fascist Italy, and imperial Japan) they just prepared to be unprepared in the event of trouble.   Retiring Fresno State Professor  urlLink Victor Davis Hanson , citing Hitler’s legions of non-German authoritarian allies,  urlLink made  the salient point that some of the most multilateral causes are bad ones.  On the other hand, many times liberal democracies have had to stand—and therefore act—alone, as the United Kingdom did in 1940.  Unilateralism proved indispensable, though fortunately only temporary.        The various anti-war critics are looking backward.  A powerless cause is now, in addition, terribly dated.  The United States will be involved in pacifying and rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan for some time, as it will surely do elsewhere.  Activist whining will not achieve victory in or withdrawal from Iraq.  Instead, it merely deepens the fantasy that the world can be gently turned back to the deceptively calm 1990s, when al-Qaeda and the Palestinian Authority, the axis of evil and the illicit arms market, all flourished while being overlooked.       Democrats began to shy away from assertive superpower strategies during the Vietnam War, yet both recent Democrat presidents have used force overseas on behalf of improving political order despite the Vietnam Syndrome.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have often taken the lead on essential foreign and military policy despite surviving vestiges of isolationism in the party.  In the last generation, the Democrats’ elusive consensus has become increasingly hesitant in the international arena; the hawkish Democrats are often seen, by default, as imitating the Republican Party.       That continuity across party lines is an achievement to applaud, not condemn: Islamic radicalism and Arab fascism will not disappear with the inauguration of a left-liberal Bostonian president.  Kerry, if elected, will have to prove an outstanding wartime leader lest he be turned out after one term.  If he abdicates or shortchanges the prosecution of the war on terror and the new cold war against the rogue states, a neo-Reaganite/neo-Bushian Republican will easily and justifiably win the White House in 2008.          As such, it is time to start thinking again of this many-faceted war as a bipartisan effort and not the hated property of one administration.  It is bigger than Bush and Kerry, bigger than Blair and Chirac, and even bigger than conventional divisions of the Left and Right. The war on terror is a war on behalf of democratic consensus (progressive, conservative and centrist alike) against anti-liberal dictators and movements.  Even if one side or another decides to ignore this fact out of spite toward an elected leader, the larger struggle remains unchanged.        So get ready for a hawkish Kerry presidency, if it shall be anything but a failure.  Whatever the electoral outcome, America's current crop of enemies will be the same, and the new term begun in January of 2005 (and possibly the one in January of 2009) will be for a war president.  Democrats must embrace this during the campaign; Kerry may not want to lose the anti-war voters like failed candidate  urlLink Lieberman  did, but he will have to govern like Lieberman would have.        When do the Democrats want to break the bad news?

           I have only attended two candlelight vigils held in public places.  The first was on Tuesday September 11, 2001 in Oberlin, Ohio, where I had attended college.  The second was on Thursday, June 10, 2004 outside San Francisco’s city hall.  Both were commemorating events felt nationwide: the al-Qaeda attacks on America and the  urlLink death  of epochal former President Ronald Reagan.       If the terrorism in New York and Washington caught America off guard, it literally caught much of Oberlin asleep three years ago, myself included.  By afternoon, the political reactions to the destructive assault were emerging more clearly after the initial shock of the news.  One friend informed me that she would be leading a candlelight vigil, adding some unfortunate but predictable blather about peace.  I replied that peace was long gone already, and last seen on four crashed airplanes and at their sites of impact.  This was not an entirely new disagreement: I had become a “Bosnia hawk” (pro-war liberal) some years before, and the college had no shortage of anti-capitalist, anti-military and anti-modern politics.  Nonetheless, she entreated me to attend for the mere sake of paying my respects to the victims of massacre, making an offer I could not refuse.       The vigil she led that night was a radical disgrace.  After a few rounds of “Amazing Grace”—the leader was a vocal performance major at Oberlin’s Conservatory of Music—my friend called the attackers insane, then sermonized lamely about how a nuclear armed America, should it declare war on rogue states and their terrorist clients, would inescapably destroy the entire world in the very near future.  Al-Qaeda murdered thousands in America, Palestinians danced in the streets, and she worried about Bush’s trigger finger rather than acknowledging that others had launched a war on us.  She admonished our government while ignorantly refusing to consider the objectives of the terrorists, imagined as some apolitical lunatics.  The shame of twenty-something leftism was made plain that day: a demonstration in every sense of the term, indeed.       The crowd in Oberlin was with her.  The next person to speak up prayed for the souls of the terrorists, since the victims were already in heaven.  Having left Christianity some years ago—don’t ask—I politely declined to obey his solemn request.  Those hijacker monsters thought they were going to heaven, and didn’t need any kind words from anyone else, religious or otherwise.  Others bleated about world justice and their fear of America’s power.  It made me ill.  My friend had, however, given the attackers a (token) negative description, so I took that as an opening.  At my next chance in the Great Sharing, I exhorted the crowd to never let its profound sympathy for the downtrodden become an excuse for extremism and a fellow traveler’s blind eye turned to terror.  Considering that religiously radical Third Worldists had just destroyed the World Trade Center and buried a jet in the Pentagon, it was the best insight of the evening, if I do say so myself.       Not that the Marxoid and pacifist crowd of liberal arts college students noticed.  Immediately after my plea for a moral response to deranged revolutionaries, another vigil attendee asked the crowd to sing a sentimental folk song, “The Mary Ellen Carter.”  It is a memorial to a beloved boat that has sunk after surviving many storms, and will “rise again,” with advice that the listeners do the same.  I had had enough of song circles punctuated by mostly leftist and self-help discourse.  America was at war, and I had more on my mind than this children’s crusade could ever comprehend: self-esteem and pacifism had nothing to do with the confidence and peace that come through strength.  I bitterly put out my candle and walked away from the vigil.       Three summers later, I was living in San Francisco when Ronald Reagan died.  A man who achieved a bigger peace through strength—including the prosecution of several small wars against Soviet proxies—and led the transformation of the economy, Reagan was a giant among modern statesmen.  As a former socialist who later saw the American light, I had a great admiration for the victor against the USSR and cofounder of the Third Way.  Local political domination by rich, inaccessible New Democrats and demagogic New Leftists had sparked my interest in the  urlLink California Republicans , and the  urlLink San Francisco Republican County Central Committee  notified me that there would be a candlelight vigil for Reagan.       I had only been in touch with  urlLink SFGOP Communication Vice-Chair  and  urlLink commentator  Leo Lacayo for a few months.  Since my disappointment after voting in the March Democratic primary—which was uncompetitive at federal,  urlLink state , local and ideological levels—I had begun to consider my alternatives.  The modest  urlLink SF Republicans  do not have the militancy, organization, funding or head count to strike one as part of a “vast, right-wing conspiracy.”  That said, the small vigil included a broad span of the party: local officials, the California GOP  urlLink Chairman  George “Duf” Sundheim, and an articulate Congressional  urlLink candidate  named Claudia Bermudez.       She is a Nicaraguan immigrant to America and daughter of Contra leader Enrique Bermudez, now running against radical East Bay Congresswoman Barbara Lee.  Her father united former Sandinistas, conservative exiles and especially  urlLink peasants  dispossessed by socialist land confiscation, fighting the Marxist party-state to a draw.  Shortly after the historic landslide defeat of the Sandinistas in the 1990 elections—despite persistence in the police and army ranks, they have not returned to power since—Enrique “Commandante 380” Bermudez was murdered by an appartchik in a Managua parking lot.  Lacayo had worked with Enrique when Claudia was a child, living in Nicaragua for several years in the 1980s.  He told the assembled the story of Sandinista land mines planted in the northern territories, which killed innocents more frequently than Contras.  The international Left invariably portrayed this as collateral damage caused by the anti-communists instead of an atrocity of the revolution.  Despite these barriers, Reagan aided both Bermudez father and daughter to triumph.  Orphaned by Marxism and naturalized by the Great Communicator, Claudia shed tears for her father and her mentoring president.       Compared to the huge, vitriolic marches of the Left, we several dozen gathered in honor of Reagan were a minor non-spectacle.  A dozen or so protesters did their best to cause a disturbance.  Some parroted their pseudo-knowledge with the  urlLink mythical  assertion that Reagan never mentioned AIDS, others shouted “death to imperialism” and “I wish Ronald Reagan could die twice!”  A few radical bicycle messengers circled the block, uttering antipathy with each lap.       Their behavior made me think of the obnoxious leftist vigil I had attended on September 11, 2001, with the mourners of my past and hecklers of the present representing two sides of the same proverbial coin.  Oberlin’s traditionalist rural townspeople, for the record, had not turned out to protest the softheaded anti-Americanism of the outsider college students in their midst.  No, “open-minded” San Franciscans had to set the example of intolerance toward a memorial.       A former Republican campaigner remarked that Reagan’s struggle against totalitarianism was on behalf of us all, including leftist trash.  True, but the late, great Albert J. Nock wrote that some matters cannot be governed by law or even morality, so much as by good taste, and I felt inspired.         In a crowd of mostly middle aged or senior activists who knew Reagan, I was one of very few youths.  I recounted my memories of the 1984 presidential campaign, during which some of those gathered had worked directly for the president’s re-election.  As a child in the ‘80s, I grew up under both the Reagan administration and the warming glow of television.  The Mondale/Ferraro ticket had an overwhelming majority of the broadcast campaign advertisements, and endless set of apocalyptic warnings against re-electing the Republicans.  Some of the most commonly repeated spots were just footage of missile launches followed by the Democrats names.  With its preponderance of televisual power, my seven year-old mind naturally assumed that Mondale’s campaign would win.  Instead, Reagan—whose campaign only ran a few TV spots late in the race—ended up winning over 54 million votes, more than any democratically elected official in human history, leading the Democrats by over eighteen percentage points, winning forty-nine states and losing only Minnesota and Washington, D.C.  If anyone says that advertising time and money is the essence of modern democracy, I offer the  urlLink landslide  disproof of the 1984 elections and its nearly seventeen million ballot deficit.       The 1980s and 1990s were fickle times, and I pursued a mostly leftward course for years after the end of the Cold War.  As I told the assembled mourners, I was for a time an ignorant Marxist savage, although more polite than the churlish Red rebels assailing the Reagan memorial gathering.  Then I was stunned.  I looked over at Claudia Bermudez and Leo Lacayo.  Studying the sacrifices of the Contras had long ago ended my romance with Latin American Marxism.  Now I was in the presence of veterans of the struggle.  Yes, I continued, I had become an ignorant Marxist savage, but thanks to men like Claudia’s father Enrique Bermudez and Ronald Reagan I had not only seen the light, but there had still been a light for me to see.  One-party systems in the developing world were nothing but a reddish darkness, and the counterrevolutionary 1980s showed that liberalism could indeed triumph over the novelty of socialism.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Commandante 380.  Viva la contrarevolución democrática.       I had been uncertain about attending the vigil, in part for fear of leftist harassment.  The latter turned out to be lowly, but business as usual in San Francisco; the former was inspirational and tasteful.  The memorial also reminded me about what had been so empty about Oberlin on September 11, 2001, when elitism and utopianism repeated their old slogans rather than admitting reality.  Of course, 1980s politics were just as divisive, and the New Left of twenty years ago deserved to get bent as much as its counterparts before and since that time.  Thanks for the negative examples, sentimental leftists.  I’ll send you a postcard for each military and economic victory of Western capitalist democracy.  Oberlin and San Francisco will be spared, but mocked.

      George Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair today in 1903.  You can peruse some of his fine work both  urlLink here  and at the Literature Network cited  urlLink below .  Any ten sentences of Orwell show what a dwarf  urlLink Noam Chomsky  is in comparison.  Remember: the author of "Animal Farm" and "1984" died young, and the anti-American MIT psycholinguist has had a much longer life to reach some supposed potential as a thinker.  It so happens that a former Chomsky collaborator, Washington D.C. correspondent and former British radical Christopher Hitchens, has written an outstanding  urlLink book  on George Orwell and is a better heir to his generous legacy.    Chomsky has not taken a brave stand since the generation of 1968 enthroned him as some sort of irrational genius.  Even during my Marxist days, I could tell from attending a 1995 Chomsky lecture that he was a  urlLink real bastard  with a shallow intellect, abusive tendencies toward his own audience, and a creepy fondness for terrorists like Peru's Maoist Sendero Luminoso (a.k.a. the Shining Path), whose many fellow travellers were raising funds at the event.  In hip and higher educated circles, though, Chomsky is exceedingly welcome.  Anti-capitalists and anti-militarists who do not like to read about history and politics can pull one of his prefabricated screeds about why everything under the sun is the Fault of the United States and No One Else.  Some of them turn out to be transcripts of five or six nearly identical interviews, like the feeble instant book "9/11."  The mature Orwell, a wounded veteran of the Spanish Civil War, would have had no patience for Chomsky's crypto-Stalinist cant.  Neither does the mature Hitchens, an irascible ex-Trotskyist who  urlLink famously  began to  urlLink debate  his  urlLink way  out of  urlLink "The Nation"   starting when the magazine and  urlLink Chomsky  in particular  urlLink trivialized  the war with al-Qaeda and Islamofascist rogue states.  Having traded his  urlLink Minority Report  column for "Slate"'s  urlLink Fighting Words , Hitchens later offered  urlLink this  critical postmortem on another former intellectual partner, literary critic and Palestinian nationalist  urlLink Edward Said .  He may still be a bit naive on democratic radicals who defy the jihadist elite of the West Bank and Gaza, but is remarkable how far Hitchens had come from his days of co-editing a primer on Palestine with Chomsky and Said.  Last but not least, Christopher Hitchens has just  urlLink confronted  the paranoid hypocrite  urlLink Michael Moore , whom "The New Republic" aptly called "Chomsky for children."  Before giving any money to this wealthy propagandist by purchasing a ticket to "Fahrenheit 9/11," give it a read.  ("Fahrenheit 451" author  urlLink Ray Bradbury  is not pleased that Moore is ripping-off his novel's title, either.)  There is no worse or more visible pop Marxist out there today than Moore--whoever says he and the "anti-war" radicals are not influential has not been paying attention--and perhaps no finer adversary than Hitchens.  Lock and load, indeed.

      These "open letters" were written almost exactly one year and a half ago to Professor Ruth Rosen, a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle and historian of American women at University of California, Davis.  She had speculated in this  urlLink piece  that someday the world could abolish war much like it had abolished slavery.  It was the sort of sentimental meditation that was very common in the months preceding Operation Iraqi Freedom.    Immediately, my spidey senses were tingling at the presence of a pernicious error.  Not only do many forms of slavery persist, like in a trans-Pacific brothel trade that reaches the Bay Area, but Rosen has even published a book on prostitution in early 20th century America and just should have known better.  New Left pieties are so silly, and yet so widely held by Baby Boomer left-liberals of varying militancy and by my contemporaries, their usually insufferable children.    Anyhow, your knight in shining armor rode in both to rescue human chattel from discursive obscuirty and to defend wars (like those that end slavery) from comparison with human bondage.  During a visit to my parents in a Chicago suburb I composed the following:  Professor Ruth Rosen, Though you and I differ in worldviews, I have enjoyed reading your columns thus far.    I must begin with a remark on a factual error in this one, "World Without War?" (The San Francisco Chronicle, Thursday, December 26, 2002).  Slavery (by whatever definition) is not, as you assert, banned worldwide: the People's Republic of China is a glaring offender, as your colleague Debra Saunders recently  urlLink noted --and as the Rainbow Co-op grocery store in San Francisco prefers to ignore while choosing to boycott Israeli goods.  The chattel enslavement and sale of Africans still continues in Mali and Sudan, though only the occasional public commentator cares to mention it.  One sometimes hears shadowy tales of brothel slavery in Southeast Asian cities, catering to wealthy entrepreneurs and their functionaries.  We know these human traffic lines reach brothels in San Francisco.  Then there are the various states of quasi-slavery in the leftover Leninist states, for what is freedom in a nation run like a giant prison camp, as in Cuba and in North Korea?  Let us not forget the unfree labor conditions of sweatshops and agrarian peonage in many of the less developed market economies.  The latter might be a semantic stretch of "slavery," but you get the idea.  The point being: illiberal portions of human society are the sanctuary of such atrocities; the liberal democracies like the U.S., Britain and others merely subtracted themselves from the chattel slavery clientele.  Worth noting: they destroyed the slave economy through war, liberty brought on the bayonets of progressive empires.  The pan-African sales apparatus did not disappear as a result.  It took the Arabian Peninsula much longer to quit buying, and the legacy there is eerie: their African slaves tended to die off rather than survive into emancipation and posterity.  I hope you would agree with the spirit of the preceding criticisms, even if your article lacked mention of the horrors that provoked them.  It is a disservice, however, to leave them unsaid.  Your pedigree is in the New Left, but do not forget one incontrovertible grain of truth from the Old Right: this world is imperfect, and by all evidence, it is imperfectible.    On our troubled planet, I expect people will always fight, some early and for self-interest, some latecomers and out of sympathy, some because they were dragooned.  Unfortunately, the downtrodden, the righteously indignant, can be unsavory as well, complicating our ideas of just causes and fair fights.  The medieval French Jacquerie descended into rape and massacre of noncombatants, later the Nat Turner revolt and the guerrilla movement in Belgian Congo did roughly the same.  Too often, the black Sudanese are defended against their would-be captors by pubescent paramilitaries, and too often, the underage soldier is an immature war criminal in the making.  There are countless other similar examples.  Political unification, so long thought to be the mechanism that would end war, has proven unreliable as well.  Just look at the Basques/Euzkadi and at Northern Ireland (hardly out of the woods) in the entrails of the European Union, and many more in the multiethnic failed states (and failing states) of the post-colonial and post-communist worlds.  Would a more unified future world be free of its Ulsters, its Lebanons, its Kashmirs, its Balkans?  Even under improved social conditions, a few malcontents can spearhead what they themselves consider war, albeit war writ small.  (Remember Thomas Friedman's recent column on the "Arab/Muslim basement," the extremist and active few, as more dangerous than the "Arab/Muslim street," the displeased but inactive many?)    What of the militiamen dotting the rural United States?  Or their opposite numbers on the Left, like C. Clark Kissinger's Refuse and Resist umbrella organization, conceived by way of a union between his Maoism and the calamity of the 1992 L.A. riots?  Of Klansmen and neo-Nazis?  Of neo-Panthers and of what remains of the armed wing of the American Indian Movement?  Or the riot-prone anti-globalization and “anti-war” activists whom I knew from Oberlin College and their colleagues elsewhere?  Will the voice clamoring for peace--usually the voice of the private citizen and/or the Left, and not the state--be the most effective counterforce to these phenomena?  So often the voices of peace shudder to criticize the violent Left, much less rein it in.  Paul Berman has described this tragedy of the Baby Boom Left rather well (while still identifying with it).  Anti-imperialism gave (and gives still) excuses to Third Worldist and Communist violence, while merely demanding surrender or appeasement by the other side.  The religious pacifist Right is little better: remember the paradox of the Bethlehem Catholic clergy sheltering Palestinian mujahedin while bemoaning the Israeli Defense Forces.  The isolationist Right lacks the compassion to work for large-scale peace, but merely withdrawal: peace for the few and the Self by ignoring the many and the Other.    Or is a well-prepared regime (or alliance of regimes) striving for security and ordered liberty a better bet for achieving peace in practice?  After all, real peace in a world of latent (and not so latent) hostility will begin with either a unilateral defeat or a wary detente, not as an entente.  On the contrary, an all-too-easy coexistence can renew hostility for those displeased with social peace.  Comfortable societies were no safeguard against brutally great expectations.  What else could explain the Weathermen, the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, and others like them?  They themselves had suffered no contemporary police abuses like the Northern Irish Catholics or African Americans, and thus could not attempt to justify their motives as communal vengeance or as collective self-interest.  They chose violence because they chose millenarian idealism, solidarity through conviction.  As such, shouldn't we beware the utopian conscience a little more often?    Montesquieu said that no kingdom had shed so much blood as that of Christ.  Imagine what he could have said two centuries later about the kingdom of Karl Marx.  Either way, it's the same verdict.  Equality of condition, like the realm of God, is not of this world, and never will be.  Expecting or demanding too much of either, however, can have a hefty body count.  The struggle continues, surely, but is it too much for us to subject ideologies and their practice to cost-benefit analysis?  Sanctimony kills, both through commission and negligence, but more modest sanctimonies kill fewer people than other, more immodest ones.  William Blake said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  The self-consciously best intentions, like premature world peace or heaven on earth, are the express lane to global inferno.  At least, all of the lessons of history would seem to teach us so.  On September 11, 2001, a mob of xenophobes in a Chicago suburb marched toward a mosque with hopes of destroying it.  They were not stopped by peace, love, or conscience in any appreciable sense, for those are intangibles.  They were stopped tangibly by a uniformed police force, and one that I suspect was not motivated by deeply held multiconfessional ideals, but by duty and by fear of impending disaster.  Motive without means, however, is nothing.  Peace can only come through order, and order through a governmental monopoly on the legitimate deployment of violence.  World peace would only arrive through world order.  World order will only come--if at all--through existing (if evolving) power structures rather than through an attempt to overturn them or perfect them.  Whether right or wrong in their aims, whether violent or not in their chosen means, all rebellions are an act of challenge to the status quo, the consummation of disorder, the opposite of peace.  The avowed final goal of most ideologies is peace (and not catastrophe), whether libertarian, theocratic, Bismarckian, socialist, or otherwise.  That imagined destination, however, does not make peace, and in and of itself, never will.  It can, however, make catastrophe, and often does.  We should know better by now.  Until everyone knows better, peace will remain elusive.   Sincerely,   Adam William Balling History major and former idealist  Oberlin College, Class of 2001 Dissident newcomer to San Francisco ********************************  Ruth Rosen wrote back a couple of sentences, saying that she appreciated my sophisticated letter and was (of course!) aware of enduring slavery, but had not felt like mentioning it.  Besides, she pointed out, all of the "civilized" nations had overcome slavery.  Yes, I thought, but what of the densely populated other ones, tenured idiot?   Feeling my adversary's argument crumble like dry poundcake, I sent this:  Professor Rosen,      Thank you for writing back, first of all.  I appreciate it very much.       I did not doubt your knowledge of current slavery.  It struck me that in "World Without War?" you referred to its existence as past, without implying its contemporary persistence.  Forgive me for overlooking any references in your previous output.     The analogy of previously disappeared slavery to the latent disappearance of war seemed false, as the former triumph is an illusion, suggesting we should not remotely expect the latter.  It seemed like a poor occasion for your congratulation of humans in general, and a weak foundation for optimism.  If nothing else, consider the further blood and treasure, whether indigenous, "multilateral" or "neo-imperial," that would be required to shut down slavery in Africa; hands-off neutralism will never do it.  The People's Republic of China, with a UN veto and (as of the Clinton era) long-range nuclear missiles, cannot be touched by forceful outside intervention.  The wait for free and fair labor in the world's most populous state will be prolonged and agonizing, and its course unknowable.  My historical knowledge has, I confess, led me to a severe pessimism about the capacity of humanity as a whole.  The idealism of Addams, King, Rankin, Gandhi, Einstein, however moving to the conscientious imagination, can be outright harmful if it is naively unrealistic.  Take Gandhi: to many, he is the model of moral nobility, even sanctity.  George Orwell's critical  urlLink assessment  of him resonated with me far more.  Sainthood and lofty ideals can be too divorced from reality, and are doubly problematic when they originate in the inability to accept the necessary inconsistencies of human life.  Otherworldiness does no social good if it is principally and ultimately escapist, and most people cannot live by the dictates of inspiring fantasy.  It is foolish to believe they ever will.  Orwell continues: Gandhi's advice that Europe's Jews allow themselves to die so that the world might look with peaceful, pressuring outrage on the Third Reich. Gandhi was well-meaning and utterly wrong, morally as well as practically.  Only coercion could be used, and alas, coercive means are an essential ingredient of all organized human life: ergo war stays.  Satyagraha and European withdrawal are two (of many) noble-sounding means for the pursuit of peace in our time, but if you seek their monument, look around.  Europe was only integrated as an expensive American protectorate; the European peace should not be attributed anachronistically to a revolution in character.  (If our own government should spend more on public healthcare, it couldn't hurt for the "new and improved" Europe--if its stability is not just a pleasing myth or political fad--to pick up more of the tab for our military spending on their behalf and free up our surplus money.  Such a change would improve upon the habit of expecting a U.S. peackeeping substitute and then bemoaning its deployment in lieu of continental self-sufficiency.)  South Asian independence instantly let slip the dogs of war, with effects worse than all of the British imperial years combined.  Doesn't Gandhi's anti-war naivete deserve some blame for helping to unleash a state of strife on the subcontinent that has not ended?  His ascetic ideology was not considerate of his actual society, but only a bastardized and imaginary alternative one.  A more unsentimental politics would not have been lying to and endangering itself on the basis of transcendental platitudes.  Burke was correct in claiming that politics is the art of the possible, and conversely denial "ain't just a river in Egypt."  Wishing for what we cannot have, and acting in vain upon those desires, is perilous.  Wishing away war is sometimes the best guarantee that it will return with a vengeance.  Isn't that even worse than conventional realpolitik?  Realism (in the sense of both policy and temperament) creates a better climate for peace than idealism, which often spawns the exact opposite of what it seeks.  That is why the goal of "an end to wars" is such a heinously tragic flaw.  Anyway, I've managed to repeat the first letter, so I might as well be merciful and end this one.  Is it a shameful thing to believe that the human race entire cannot improve itself very well or very quickly?  Because it seems more accurate than the belief that it can improve itself rapidly and thoroughly; accuracy is what gets results.   thank you again for corresponding,  Adam William Balling   P.S.  On a different note, you are a specialist in American history, yes?  Might I inquire what period(s), theme(s), topic(s), region(s)?  If you had not guessed, I love to talk shop.  History first enchanted me at age seven, the "age of reason," and I have never lost my passion for that subject.  ********************************  I even tried to be friendly at the end, but Professor Ruth Rosen left our correspondence unrequited thereafter.    But hey, Michael Moore never wrote back when I asked him his opinion of "Mother Jones" magazine and Ralph Nader, both of which fired him.  I also inquired about his falling out with labor organizer Harlan Jacobson during the interview published in the November/December 1989 issue of "Film Comment."  Trade union leftist Jacobson did not take kindly to the histrionic lies of Moore's "Roger and Me," despite their shared dislike of big capitalism.

      Zachary Colie's story in yesterday's "San Francisco Chronicle" (linked in my previous post) is one of many that misrepresents  urlLink the September 11 Commission , claiming that body found "'no credible evidence' of deep links" between Ba'athist Iraq and al-Qaeda.  The paper underscored the point with Thursday's Chronicle News Service summary (inexplicably not available online) and Wednesday's Associated Press newswire reports (which are  urlLink hither ,  urlLink thither , and  urlLink  yon ).  The AP dispatches luridly assert as fact (in the third person) that the Bush administration's entire stated rationale for invading Iraq was Saddam Hussein's alleged cooperation with al-Qaeda on the 2001 attacks.  Not quite: the White House and British PM Tony Blair maintained that rogue states and international terrorism were like oily rags that could ignite at any future time--and hence their very existence an unacceptable hazard--as well as pointing to other previous links.  At least the AP reporters will (perhaps grudgingly) allow parts of this actual rhetoric in an effort to dismissively cite the politicians' views (as mere quotes).  Colie and  urlLink the Chronicle  will not even do that much.  Erroneously, they have ignored the Commission's  urlLink proceedings  and public comments like  urlLink these  from its chairman and vice chairman.  Mohammed Atta's  urlLink suspected meeting  with Iraqi intelligence in Prague is a controversial allegation officially doubted by their report, but not  urlLink other connections , like the Kurdish militia Ansar al-Islam, a widely known Ba'athist-jihadist joint venture against American allies.  For whatever reasons, the AP dropped the ball on these Islamic fascist terrorists of Iraqi Kurdistan as well.  I can forgive a forthright "biased liberal media," but not a pretentious and slow-witted one.  Of course, it could also have been a willful deception, with journalistic sloganeering about "deep links" to excite a gullible election year readership, particularly in the Bay Area.  A soft press partly explains the vicious  urlLink hesperophobia  (fear or hatred of the West) in our leftist local yokels.  Either way: bad newsroom, no liquor for you tonight.

      The September 11 Commission has  urlLink reported  that al-Qaeda envisioned a ten airplane assault, that Iraq and this terrorist network had plenty of contacts (although not on the 2001 attacks), and that Osama bin Laden had wanted to launch it earlier, during the last year of Clinton's administration, to coordinate with the al-Aqsa intifada agasinst Israel.  Will any of these revelations undercut "Fahrenheit 9/11," the latest round of fraudulent conspiracy-theory crockumentary from disgraced former "Mother Jones" editor Michael Moore?  (He was fired from that radical journal in 1986 for refusing to publish a Paul Berman article that criticized the Sandinistas as well as the Contras.  Avoiding arteriosclerosis, he then cobbled together the unnecessarily dishonest rust-belt postcard "Roger and Me.")  One can only hope that he will now be seen as the  urlLink portly, caucasian counterpart  of "New York Times" anti-hero  urlLink Jayson Blair  that he truly is.  Or that Moore finally gets that coronary that he deserves.  Super size it, Michael.

      For two days I have been embroiled in a spirited debate with my good friend Andrew Fisher about  urlLink these photos  of "anti-war" protesters in San Francisco earlier this month.  After Reagan's death, Andrew had sent me a barrage of critical left-of-center articles, asking how I could defend such a president.  The HIV/AIDS post is one result; others on unsavory Third World allies will follow.  I decided to return the favor with a polemic about how the mainstream Left has not told the anti-American and ethnic-cleansing advocates to go stuff themselves.  Their message is insanely anti-Israeli: comparing the Middle East's only electoral democracy to Nazi Germany and positing that Zionists cause anti-Semitism themselves.  Their final solution is to "smash the Jewish state"--talk about blaming the victim--handing ownership to that lovely Mr. Arafat and whoever runs Hamas until the next targeted elimination.  International "Act Now, Stop War, End Racism" is a perverse misnomer: they support "all intifadas everywhere," a pro-violence position that makes Republican hawks look like Mahatma Gandhi.  Their bizarre (largely self-)hatred of all Western societies seems like a racist fantasy of redemption through the swarthy Other.  Crackpots will always exist, but a responsible movement divorces itself from its lunatic elements, in much the way that American conservatism's modern cofounder William F. Buckley spurned the John Birch Society.  Before that a nativist and isolationist 1930s-1940s American Right eventually marginalized its fascist sympathizers, in part under Buckley's leadership.  Birch-leader Bob Welch (who accused President Eisenhower of being a communist) and author Ezra Pound (who did wartime broadcasts for Mussolini) were no longer welcome in respectable traditionalist circles or the Republican party, and with good reason.    Calmer opponents of involvement in World War II soon found themselves in a lonely dilemma: adapt or perish.  Like publisher Henry Regnery, they quickly entered new debates on communism and the containment or rollback of the Soviet empire: their idea that America's fight in Europe could have been avoided was rendered irrelevant.  It is very sad that "we have come a long way since the 1940s," so far that now the mostly leftist war resisters are not even democratic proponents of averting our national eyes, but repellent Jew-baiters willing to strut through a cosmopolitan and progressive San Francisco (and other cities and college towns) with their heads held high and their vicarious intifada wishes.  The major Marxist organizations have parroted anti-Zionism ever since Stalin, and International ANSWER is no exception.  A popular front for the Maoist and pro-North Korea,  urlLink Workers World Party , and ANSWER have the same office spaces in most cities.  Their dual San Francisco one is three blocks away from my apartment.  The popular front technique--engineered by Lenin, perfected by Stalin--is to piggyback on other progressive causes: collective bargaining, opposition to the death penalty or to war, and so forth.  Then they can guide the movements.  The demostrations' only remaining organizers now are crypto-communists like ANSWER, Not In Our Name, Refuse and Resist, and United for Peace and Justice.    This pre-World War II trick is working, and none of my more progressive friends seem to care as much about it as they do about tired "anyone but Bush" platitudes.  More importantly, where are the good liberal Democrat officials instructing these more radical movements to go to hell?  Are their votes so important that in an election year John Kerry will not denounce them vocally?    Ah, but as my friend claims, most of these communist yahoos will vote Green or more radically, should they vote at all.  If that's the case, then the entire Democrat party can reject them tomorrow. Hypothetically, so can the two Green parties: anti-military ecological socialists should have standards, too.  Unfortunately, Senator Kerry owes his entire public career to an identical movement against the United States and its allies on behalf of Stalinist North Vietnam: once they made him famous thirty years ago, then he could settle into the Massachusetts Democrat establishment.  Kerry probably does not dream about Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap, but the candidate is such a sleaze that he lacks the courage to challenge the worst reincarnations of the New Left.  Perhaps he imagines that he owes them a debt, or that he might still pick up their ballots.    Either way, silence equals death. Remember that Robert Kennedy was assassinated on June 6, 1968 (another anniversary I missed this month) by a radical Palestinian nationalist.  The New Left killed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later that summer, handing the fall election to Nixon.  Four years later, WWII veteran George NcGovern led the anti-war movement and the Democrats to a landslide defeat.  A pretentious pro-withdrawal Ted Kennedy undercut his party by running against President Carter in the 1980 primaries.  A neo-isolationist Pat Buchanan did the same to the elder President Bush in 1992.  What is so odd is that now the Winter Soldier who witnessed nothing but war crimes is running as the Hero of the Band of Brothers.  Call it self-reinvention or sleight of hand, but the Senator is campaigning on war Democrat machismo without having explained the fate of his former radical loyalties.  As the son of a Vietnman War veteran, I have no patience for public figures who court both patriots and anti-Americans simultaneously through murky references to their past in Indochina.  Pick a side and make me proud.  Denounce your veteran friends as war criminals all, just like you did before Congress in the 1970s, or tell all of the other veterans you never met that you are very sorry for what you said about your band of brothers under oath.  I might add the million or more refugees from Stalinist-conquered South Vietnam, many of them here in California, who also deserve an apology for America's abandonment of their defense.  They know intimately that Hanoi terrorized the whole country, rather than championing or liberating "the people."  Until Kerry comes clean on this "ancient history" and its relation to his current self-profile in courage, I doubt he will upbraid the ANSWER-ite Judeophobes.  If the Democrat elite and the liberal rank-and-file cannot stand up to the totalitarian leaders of the domestic "anti-war" movement, how can they ever confront extremism and terrorism in the world?  Think globally, act locally?  Voters like myself have good reason to believe that Kerry and many other Baby Boomer Democrat do not know what they are doing.  They are apparently unable to choose between hegemonic Harry Truman and fellow travellers of "world revolution," preferring to straddle both positions in the name of marketing.  I will not vote for a party that cannot decide between superpower liberalism and anti-American policies, and I will not respect a progressive movement that cannot protest its own illiberal members.  At least Rudolph Giuliani and Arnold Schwarzenegger loudly opposed Bush's heterosexual marriage amendment at the risk of "splitting the Republicans."  I entreat my liberal readers to follow their example instead of politely ignoring enemies further to the Left.  Picket the offices of International ANSWER/WWP and the other Marxoid organizations.  You do not need them in your coalition.  Their presence explains my absence.  This discussion has only begun.  The Bay Area Democrats especially have not taken out the garbage in quite some time, and the stench is crippling me with nausea.  There are too many problems with leftist political culture to blame them all on rural and suburban conservatives or big corporations.  Admitting so is the first step on the road to recovery.

      Do not rejoice in his defeat, you men. For though the world stood up and stopped the bastard, The bitch that bore him is in heat again. -Bertolt Brecht,  translation courtesy of Sam Peckinpah's outstanding 1977 film adaptation of Willi Heinrich's "Cross of Iron"  Let the tyrants tremble, for the world that stopped that bastard is now standing up to his clones.  Ruled by military dictators since the 1940s, the Marxist-fascist hybrid Ba'ath since the 1960s and the Asad dynasty of that party since 1970; revanchist toward Israel, Jordan and Palestine and already occupier of Lebanon; cosponsor of the the Iraqi insurgency, of the communist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, of Hizbollah, of Hamas, of Islamic Jihad--Syria truly deserves to be next.  Shoot straight, America, on the road to Damascus.    It's time for the Middle East to enter the age following the Second World War, sixty years behind schedule.  Someone wake up the Allies' creation known as the United Nations; it has been slacking off in the Muslim societies for too long, and might go the way of the League in the 1930s if it is not careful.  Appeasement kills, every time.  Thank heavens for cowboy unilateralist democracies that lead the way.

      How on earth did I let myself neglect to mention that June is also Queer Pride Month, celebrated on different weekends in different locations?  Last year was my first in San Francisco, ruined by a homophobic heathen family that was visiting with my girlfriend's relatives.  Narrow minded bastards proved the reason that it's a mighty crucial event just by being there, unaware and hostile.  In our local parade, the San Francisco Republicans were of course generously represented alongside the hyper-majority Democrats and minority Greens.  Tripartisan or non-partisan, a loud and proud consensus.  It's the welcome wave of the future, and remember it this month.  Warmongers can (and should) be allies, too.  Any "suggestions" short of full legal and public parity are completely unacceptable, and too few on the Left are even ready to recognize it, much less on the other side of the aisle.  In a few decades, they will all be remembered in shame.  Ride the Tide of Pride.

      President Reagan's actions regarding HIV/AIDS are among his least understood.  ACT UP founder Larry Kramer is  urlLink preparing  a piece called "Adolf Reagan" for an upcoming issue of  urlLink The Advocate .  This title alone is a perfect example of the absolute hysteria that ruins much of the discussion, rather than a reasoned, measured judgment one might also find  urlLink in their pages.   If you can be called Hitlerian for alleged negligence, what does that make unprotected sexual activity?  Would Kramer or someone sharing his opinion of Reagan dare to call that Nazi-like as well?  Yet that phenomenon is directly responsible for disease transmission, far more culpable than a  urlLink "closet tolerant"  presidential administration that was slow to care publicly.  Are you comfortable thinking of it as the sexual revolution's "radical holocaust" or "autogenocide by promiscuity"?  (We'll get to more details of Reagan's record shortly.)  In high school, I was an early member and later co-leader of a small student group that promoted, among other things, condom distribution, a frank sex education curriculum, women's rights and queer rights.  Despite my rightward lurch, I still support these things, although my confidence in the efficacy of preventive education has slipped.  You can imagine my horror as a true believer when I later discovered that many of my peers (even in similarly chartered activist groups) at prestigious safe(r)-sex-aware colleges and in cosmopolitan cities, well, did not buy what they sold.  No need to name names or infections, but my demographic does not have the excuse that the age of AIDS caught us off guard.  Reagan is not to blame for post-1982 self-destructiveness, which can undermine the most ostensibly prepared and educated in a generation that has been watching the fallout for its entire maturing life.  Will "The Advocate" and ACT UP be stamping the swastika upon swingers with bad judgment any time soon?  Would your sense of proportion feel ill if they did?  Would you at least want to qualify it as mass killing by mass self-neglect, like the late San Francisco Chronicle reporter, "And the Band Played On" author and gay AIDS patient Randy Shilts and his ex-Marxist fellow writers  urlLink Peter Collier  and  urlLink David Horowitz  did?  Several websites have observed the disgusting callousness of Reagan administration press secretary Larry Speakes regarding HIV/AIDS, concluding that at best, counteracting a lethal disease that at first afflicted mostly gays was a low presidential priority, and at worst, that a bemused and homophobic leadership was glad to see gay men die in large numbers.  Look at  urlLink the three  press conference excerpts in question, with questions by an unidentified journalist named "Lester," possibly Baltimore radio's only Washington correspondent, Lester Kinsolving.  (Thanks to cryptically-named "537 Votes" at this americablog posting's comment section for the possible identification.)  First off, the persistent questions from the reporter were not out of concern for the gay community but paranoia, fearing that the infected men might soon contaminate the larger population very easily.  (Not quite what happened: serious bodily fluids, not just proximity, are required.)  In the first conference, "Les" worried that the Reagan himself may have contracted "gay plague."  The third and final selection, from 1984, demonstrates the reporter's assumption that HIV is transmitted by saliva, as repellent a myth as ever circulated about the AIDS crisis.  Speakes was not just tuning out the plight of the gay community, but also the histrionics of germophobia-cum-homophobia, a multiplication of ignorance on the part of a veteran member of the credentialed national press.  Secondly, in the 1982 press conference especially, it is clear that the whole room is laughing at the expense of gay HIV/AIDS patients.  At one point, even the terrified "Lester" cracks a poor taste joke addressed to Larry Speakes: "Because I love you, Larry, that's why," to which Speakes responded "Oh, I see. Just don't put it in those terms, Lester."  In the second conference, from 1983, "Les" wondered if a message from the president would have discouraged "cruising," a word whose mention drew laughter so loud that it drowned out the room.  Speakes answered with a jerk's mixture of chuckles and platitudes about government research on the disease, before the reporter closed with a dreadful pun on "fairy tales."  The illiberal attitude toward homosexuality appears to be the common opinion of the age in these excerpts, and attitudes toward gay suffering effectively barbaric.  In my June 5 Reagan obituary, I provided a link to a Deroy Murdock  urlLink article  that pointed out in the same dismal year of 1982 the administration spent $8 million on AIDS research, $44 million in 1983, over $100 million in 1984, eventually spending over $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion during Reagan's final two years as president, and a total of $5.7 billion since the disease was identified in '82. Andrew Sullivan, who is a gay, HIV positive Reaganite, also cited this horrifying Speakes' transcript, but alternates between credit and blame for the administration's mixed record through  urlLink several posts this week.   Among Sullivan's many insights: activists like ACT UP's Kramer blame the Reagan administration for not developing a cure.  A new virus that repeals immunity was a formidable challenge.  Cancer has not been cured either.  Remedies do not just fall from the sky, to be kept at UFO facilities by a hostile and secretive presidency.  The dollar figures are a testament to prompt research, to the tune of millions the year the disease was definitively classified in 1982 when only a few thousand were infected, and a 450% increase in research funds during the first year after that, and so on.  After twenty-two years, we still lack a cure.  Is that Clinton's fault or nobody's?  Another Andrew, blogless comrade A. Fisher, has protested to me that the administration was derelict in funding AIDS treatment.  Prior to AZT, which was experimental until the end of the decade, what treatments were there?  None.  (In the interests of full disclosure, Andrew Fisher is the son of one of Rhode Island's earliest and foremost HIV/AIDS physicians.  I am the child of less prestigious doctors who also spent the 1980s knee-deep in the hopeless treatment of HIV/AIDS cases.  His distinguished father recommends the work of Reagan's principled Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop.  Neither Andrew F. nor I have read it yet.)   Back to Sullivan: the only useful thing the administration could have done was AIDS prevention education.  Let's be honest with ourselves: would a seventy-something conservative president's entreaties for protected sex have been followed by the target audience at risk?  (Sure, ex-governor Reagan had campaigned against a failed homophobic 1978 California ballot initiative, but what had the wrinkled Goldwaterite done for the gay community lately in '82?)  Based on what I have seen among today's young sexual cognoscentti (straights typically worse than gays), many at risk have not learned a damned thing in the decades since, to their own detriment.   One ignorant myth believed by many Educated Acquaintances of Mine is that Reagan either never mentioned AIDS, never mentioned it until his last year in office, and/or kept the federal government from fighting it.  Reagan mentioned AIDS several times in his 1986 state of the union address.  The latest he first mentioned it was September, 1985: perhaps unforgivably late, but empirically true.  Look it up if you don't believe Sullivan, Murdock and myself.  Now that you know the "no mention!" tale is a lie, it is Your Responsibility to correct it whenever it comes up around you.  Should you neglect this duty, you have Neither Mental Nor Political Integrity.  If the intelligentsia cannot look after its own ideas' credibility, it devalues itself completely.  HIV/AIDS caught everyone by surprise, from bathhouses that resisted inspection or shutdown to a White House (and Washington press corps) that looked on the gay community as alien, contemptible and laughable; to a medical community that did not screen hemophiliacs' transfusions until tragedy struck far too many. As the administration increasingly discussed and funded the fight against HIV-AIDS during the '80s, they never apologized for their snide public attitude toward citizens they would at first help only quietly and reluctantly.  The paradox, that the federal government would have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on research before its chief executive leadership would discuss it, is rather telling.  It speaks volumes about the gap between political style and rhetoric, on the one hand, and the astonishingly large number of activities and sums of money that an otherwise hostile administration might sign into law. It reminds us that none of our elected governments can remain an intractable monolith.  A sincere apology for cruel attitudes by some still-living figure from the administration would be in order.  Sullivan nominates Larry Speakes, and I second the motion.  Elder George Bush, as far as I can tell, did his penance by funding research and education as the next president of the AIDS age; these were my sixth through tenth grade years, and the times had clearly begun to change.  Koop was an honorable man who did what he could, then added a Cabinet-level mea culpa on the public record, according to Dr. Fisher.  Reagan's foreign policy staff was probably not involved in this health discussion; now the younger George Bush lists halting the ruinous advance of HIV/AIDS in the developing world as a pressing priority, even as he rattles the saber of a heterosexual marriage amendment (that much of his own party opposes).  We have come a long way, even if we have farther to go.  We don't need to misunderstand the past in order to make ourselves feel more enlightened, either: quite the opposite.

      For those of you interested in this year's Californian U.S. Senate race, the San Francisco Chronicle rejected a much shorter version of  urlLink this  before I sent the expanded one to their local nemesis.  I disagree with Fresno County rancher-politician Bill Jones on several issues, but Marin Country aristocrat Barbara Boxer is not even a good liberal Senator when it counts (or if you prefer, on the issues where I would like her to be).    Both she and her Republican opponent have, respectively, said nothing about same sex marriage and nothing in four months.  One gets the impression that they believe the dictum of The Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot that homosexuality is the third rail of contemporary politics, and whoever mentions it first or most, for whichever side, is cruising for losing.  For my money, I think that same sex marriages will continue to be vindicated by the courts, state by state, until a few cases go federal and one finally goes Supreme.  Voters are too hostile, legislators too weak, and there aren't enough imitators of San Francisco and New Paltz for the "municipal disobedience" option to succeed.  God bless America, and its activist judiciary.  Given two imperfect candidates, I am extremely annoyed at Boxer, an incumbent who chaired a pre-September 11 Senate subcommittee on Terrorism but "didn't even know we had an enemy."  She is exactly the kind of domestic politics national narcissist who made such attacks possible by hitting the snooze button every time an American (or other) target abroad was attacked in the 1990s.  President Bush, ex-CIA director Tenet, and even the somnabulistic Clinton administration were all more alert than that.  Boxer's idea that a bunch of inspectors at shipyards (and California has many, meaning $$$ for her home state) and elsewhere will be the most effective counterterrorists is in stark contrast to her reluctance to give a dime to the military, or even to fund her cherished Homeland Security jobs.  It also worries me that my state could become a Democrat ghetto with races that are completely uncompetitive, and each (for either party, generally safe) district quits paying attention to the major opposition.  My city already has, except during races where the Green Party accused Democrat Mayor Gavin "Same Sex Marriage Licenses" Newsom of being a  urlLink right-winger equivalent  to both neoliberal Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger and to evangelical President Bush.  They must all look the same from the perspective of dwarves with Marxist fantasies.    It's true: Matt Gonzalez, who narrowly lost to the rich and enormously funded Newsom, wrote the poem "My Green Manifesto," a list that  urlLink includes : "I read The Communist Manifesto and I liked it."  (So did I, but I was fifteen and later outgrew it.)  That document, of course, rejects electoral democracy and "bourgeois socialist" reforms short of the "dictatorship of the proletariat."  I'm not McCarthyist; he's proud of it.  The bookshop where his worshippers ("he's like a male, tan swan....mythical[!], and stubborn and independent") gathered is only a few blocks from my home, in a neighborhood that boasts at least nine competing socialist parties in the span of fifteen blocks and where Gonzalez fits in like "a regular guy."  In Germany the Greens sometimes nickname themselves "watermelons" for being "Red on the inside."    No enemies to the Left?  It's enough to make you want to vote Republican, especially in the state that founded  urlLink  the Log Cabin  clubs of the party.

      It is so unfortunate that none of the major left-wing sites noted the anniversary of China's crackdown on the 1989 protests in Beijing: CounterPunch, The Nation, In These Times, The Progressive, Z Magazine and even the mainstream liberal The American Prospect all failed.  AlterNet buried a two-paragraph  urlLink blurbette  under MediaCulture about continued repression, but nothing about the new, enormous protests in Hong Kong.  For partial credit, Salon.com reposted links to older articles at the end of May, but with no new pieces.  Civil society is struggling against one party's totalitarian exploitation of one fifth of the earth's people, and these publications are missing the story.    Only the New York Review of Books chimed in, by way of New York Times' columnist Nicholas D. Kristof assessing Bruce Gilley's "China's Democratic Future: How it Will Happen and Where it Will Lead."  Of course, they did not choose to make this article free on their website,  urlLink preferring  to grant that privilege to current affairs (understandably), but also to discussions of the late novelist John Gregory Dunne, neuroscience, and an analysis of Pinocchio's ethical metamorphosis.  No offense to the erudition of the NYRB contributors featured online, but these choices suggest unfortunate editorial priorities.   Not long ago, The Nation praised  urlLink "The Rebirth of the NYRB"  as a determined political combatant.  One wonders if it is bravely activist to demand a paid subscription to learn about the future of oppression in the world's largest country.  They could have just as easily made the reader shell out for the fiction esoterica, giving the China story to the public gratis.    Of course, NYRB also could have ignored the People's Republic entirely, like the other progressive and radical journals.  Is their collective ignorance expressing the faults of unilateral decisions by individual editors or an unplanned multilateral consensus of the American Left's major print and online magazines, and hence of the intelligentsia generally?  In a stroke of significant and accidental irony, AlterNet's homepage is currently plugging "Banana Republicans: How the Right Wing Is Turning America into a One-Party State" by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton, having previously published  urlLink  this.   Stauber and Rampton also wrote last year's "Weapons of Mass Deception," a screed against the war that toppled Iraq's one-party state, which AlterNet also  urlLink excerpted.    They have the gall to call a bicameral majority plus Republican control of the White House effectively authoritarian, while substantial foreign tyranny warrants very little mention.    Consider that the Democrats dominated both legislatures and the presidency for most of 1933-1969, interrupted briefly for parts of the 1950s.  The New Deal, Truman's Fair Deal, Kennedy's New Frontier and Johnson's Great Society were popular and Republicans overwhelmed.  Even the Eisenhower administration was anathema to many conservatives, often judged as compromised and statist.  Would AlterNet, Stauber and Rampton like to deride the Democrats' midcentury hegemony as well, in the name of political parity?  To call a generation of elected successes a "one-party state" while ignoring genuine dictatorships robs the (rightly accusing) phrase of any context, meaning or value.  How many of these magazines (and their readers) would know a one-party state if they saw one?  More importantly, having made the positive identification would they then care enough to publish much about it?  Such national self-obsession is a parochial self-deception, to say the least.  Our new world disorder is largely the work of despots in underdeveloped nations and their captive subjects, who eventually must rebel as the Chinese have begun to do.  Progressives ignore these conditions at their own peril.

      So, I broke my promise and got sleepy while researching Tiananmen '89.  This is big, though.  After many years of being lost to Alzheimer's, President Ronald Wilson Reagan is dead at age 93, America's oldest-when-elected and longest-living chief executive, and I am saluting him.    Once I discoverd the news I began with a commemoration of his Ulster Scotch Irish heritage: a recording of "Amazing Grace" on the bagpipes and a Bushmill's on the rocks.  A friend and fellow Illinoian once asked me if I would eventually toast Reagan's coming death, but I don't think he had this quite in mind.  Anyway, I have already raised my whiskey glass to Dutch, the lifeguard from Dixon, Illinois, two-term governor of my current home and our largest state, two-term guarantor of the free world who all but conquered the Soviet Union.  His films were terrible, but back in 1940s Hollywood the young Truman Democrat was subject to constant death threats for defying Communists while he was head of the Screen Actors Guild, ruining his career and scaring off his first wife, actress Jane Wyman.  (Yes, they were trying to subvert that union and others, they were hardened Stalinists, and they used violence in California just like they did elsewhere.  The heavy-handed and demagogic Red hunters were not the only guilty parties of the era.)  The greatest problem of his presidential legacy was the ease with which he let the Christian Right minority bandwagon onto his movement, and help influence the general Reaganite agenda with aspects of their extremism.  Of course, Franklin Roosevelt had the same problem, lowering the guard of the Democrats to Socialists and Communists (and eventually, to Stalin's USSR itself) at the height of his New Deal popularity: Reagan learned that early and spent his life retaliating.  At the same time, both presidents helmed the nation through immense economic and strategic crises, leading them to victory in each: against the Great Depression and fascism, stagflation and Marxism.  Besides attracting extremists, each of them attracted some from the opposing party: FDR's many progressive Republican allies and the electorally decisive Reagan Democrats.  Andrew Sullivan, extraordinary gay center-right commentator, noted three years ago that aside from cultural politics,  urlLink  "Reagan was right about almost everything."    urlLink  Deroy Murdock  noted during last year's controversy over the miniseries "The Reagans" that the president had done a great deal more about AIDS than his detractors on the Left usually claim.   The Great Communicator at his most controversial gave  urlLink this famous speech  to evangelicals in 1983.  After religiously inveighing against abortion and secularism he then turned unexpectedly to attacking the evil of right-wing hate groups, before he no less accurately called the USSR an "evil empire."  The author of that speech, Hoover Institution fellow Peter M. Robinson, hosts PBS' finest weekly in-depth show, "Uncommon Knowledge."  Last year they had a  urlLink panel  on Reagan's long, victorious struggle against Leninism.    America lost its Winston Churchill today, another flawed but brilliant modern conservative and leader of the empire of liberty.  As Andrew Sullivan said, we now all live in the First World Reagan made, with a liberal Third Way now ascendant over the statism of the 1970s and one democratic superpower instead of totalitarian expansion.    The present war is largely against the leftovers of the Soviet alliance, from Colombia to the PLO, Ba'athism in Syria and Iraq, to North Korea.  Indeed, most of the world's current conflicts are Cold War orphans.  It is a shame that neither Regan's successor, the elder Bush, nor Clinton was able to build upon the triumph enough to forestall the current crisis.  Nonetheless, consider that in 1980, few ever thought that the Soviet Union would disappear, or even stop winning new allies in developing nations.  Through blood, sweat and tears, that disaster was averted, and without a nuclear winter.  Bravo, Gipper.  Descansa en paz.

      The last few days have been very hectic.  I promise to get a new post up later tonight.    Just to get you thinking, this weekend has many of historical anniversaries that a guy like me would like to discuss.  Fifteen years ago today, the Communists crushed the protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.  Tomorrow is the anniversary of the outbreak of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.  Sunday is not just the anniversary of D-Day, being celebrated in France as Freedom Week, but Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon as well.  Later in the month comes Juneteenth.  There might be more.  Plus, with the resignation of CIA Director George Tenet and the naming of a new Iraqi government, and the march of time in general, there is always news worth reading.  I'll do what I can.  Now, however, is supper time.

      Greetings.  I am a twenty six year-old living in San Francisco, California.  I have been a history buff since I was seven, and long-obsessed with public affairs and personal worries.  Many times a convert and always a dissident, I have been a Catholic, a libertarian and a Marxist, as well as variations of mere conservative or progressive.  None quite fit me, but I'm the kind of guy who moved around several times in only nine years.  Nowadays I am an odd centrist, usually in loyal opposition to much of the mainstream Left and Right.  How many people do you know who support both same sex marriage and escalating the war on terrorists and rogue states?  Who think Bush is botching the occupation of Iraq but would support doing it all again, more lethally next time?  Who oppose the death penalty but support covert operations?  Who are pro-choice but think that it's a crime that liberals don't stand up to the radical Left more often?  Who believe in gun control but also know that Michael Moore is a fraud?  Who love hippie music but know the United States and South Vietnam were winning before the Democrats cut off funding?  Who love veterans and the educated but cannot stomach Senator John Kerry?  Who despise reactionary faith but might vote for George W. Bush anyway?  Now you know one, Adam William Balling.  Nice to meet you.  Forgive me if I didn't catch your name.  With two anxious parties going through an identity crisis, now is a shaky time in our liberal democracy.  For a moderate, it's morose.  The anti-modern movement has warped many, many planks in the platform of the party of Lincoln. Now a heavily southernized behemoth, GOP religious fanatics have prevented a lot of compromises that sensible conservatives might have made, and launched insane crusades the latter would not have begun.    Drunk on Robertson more than on Reagan, many are ready to restore prohibtionism and puritanical censorship.  Republicans interested in limited government regularly go soft on a committed, retrograde minority.  The party of liberty is hypocritical and cowardly about this internal rift.  As our culture grows more cosmopolitan, Republican excesses run self-destructive risks.  Lucky us, the Democrats are doing no better, never having disgorged the worst of its New Left vomit.  The revived "ant-globalization" and "anti-war" movements have really brought out the worst extremists behind popular fronts.  Its effects trickle down in the rhetoric: apocalyptic cowardice, isolationist sanctimony, narcissistic anti-Westernism, anti-capitalist delusions and--thanks the new popular front of Palestinian radicalism--anti-Semitism as well.   The Baby Boomer McGovernites never weeded out the VietCong true believers from the merely war-averse, and neither have my contemporaries.  To the untrained eye, militants blur with sympathetic fellow travellers, and in turn these useful idiots with center-leftists.  Just look at AlterNet or MoveOn.org, bizarre hybrids of drab establishment Democrats and rabid Marxists.  The Left cannot claim the highground, for it too has failed to guard its own ranks.  Perhaps the sudden fall of the Soviet empire is to blame, making the United States generally overconfident.  Progressives who averted their gaze could pretend that communists were no longer a problem, perhaps never a even problem in the first place, not even after the 1999 World Trade Organization riots in Seattle.  Conservatives prepared themselves for the wrong struggles, attacking sexual mores while assuming an easy peace dividend allowed for a global withdrawal.  Ribald pop culture and homosexuality were targeted for elimination rather than integration, despite the self-defeating intolerance of the quest.  Federal finances were not properly reformed, awaiting calamity with the downturn of the business cycle.    Neither party took an adequately interventionist approach to the post-Cold War international order, ignoring decades of terrorism, through al-Qaeda's USS Cole bombings in October, 2000 all the way until the World Trade Center was gone.  Instead they pursued vouchers and subsidies, cuts of each other's favored projects rather than the public interests.  They were acting like a bunch of federal Europeans, as witless toward Mexico as the EU was toward the breakup of Yugoslavia.  The third parties were even worse, narrow-minded grab bags of a few extreme positions on domestic issues, all strangely isolationist in the globalized age: Libertarian, Socialist, Reform, Green, Constitution and Natural Law.  As of today, June 2, 2004, they have not stopped.  The major parties disappoint, playing a sorry game of catch up in the new millenneum.  So I must confess to my sincere and mutual loyal opposition.  Until someone expels their extremist wing, it is the best they and I can do.  They will please me selectively, and my vote will swing accordingly.  Deep down, I hope they both clean house, sending the fanatics off to rot with Nader and Buchanan in their little fiefdoms of purity.  Otherwise, our system would skew hard into the worst of the electoral Left or Right.  Imagine one coast-to-coast overpriced, homeless-infested, underpoliced San Francisco in depths of fiscal crisis, or if you prefer, a sprawling low wage Bible Belt where social conditions stagnate from cultural repression.  I desire neither, and am willing to hand out a lot of criticism.  Eager, too.  And not very happy in this election year.  On the bright side, you never know when we and our two glorious major parties might begin to collectively evolve beyond our current revolutionaries and reactionaries.  I don't expect it any time soon, and it will come only gradually.  And along the way, I'll write about it here.  I hope you enjoy it.

      Special thanks to  urlLink CaliforniaRepublic.org  for running  urlLink my piece  on the U.S. Senate race.  A different  urlLink version  of it ran earlier at  urlLink ChronWatch.com .    Bill Jones has begun to attract more help from powerful Republican politicians and donors, but the state party still has an underdeveloped sense of grassroots activity or internet campaign savvy.  The California GOP and its country committees have yet to really exploit their internet potential, and are sometimes embarassingly late in what gestures they take: for example, notices for meetings are posted online after the fact.  As I mention in the newer draft, my local  urlLink "meetup"  for Bill Jones was canceled for lack of three warm bodies.  You might chuckle that so it goes in left-wing San Francisco, but 12% of the fog city's voters are Republican, around 54,000 people.  It should not be that hard for two of them to meet me at a cafe once a month.  Some of this may be generational, a gap in imagination and computer fluency that does not matter.  Consider that the elderly have the highest voter turnout rates, and the lowest interest in the web.  The Dean campaign was a hot cyber-topic and a great, big failure at ballot boxes.  Conservatives never have rallies or demonstrations on the scale of the Left, and yet Republicans dominate the House of Representatives.  One might even assume that the 2004 elections will not be turned by the internet.  All of this is true, for now.  It is a cliche that California trends are heralds for the rest of the nation: having been heavily settled and developed at the height of the industrial revolution and continuously ever since, the state is imagined as being at the forefront of new social tensions.  It was the first place in the country to grapple with massive non-white immigration and the corresponding mass white xenophobia, the Hollywood revolution in modern popular culture, and so forth.    In poltics, the late nineteenth and early twentieth century witnessed the corrupting predominance of the railroads, fought in the Progressive Era by new legislation permitting the ballot initiative, the refrendum and the recall.  During the New Deal, California Democrats and labor unions built many close ties to Socialists and Communists, by most accounts more strongly than counterparts in most other places in the nation.   In the 1960s, the state brought forth America's first fully developed New Left campus culture at UC Berkeley.  At the same time, California also gave the country Nixon and then Reagan, the first potent Republican alternatives to Democrat rule since before the Great Depression.  Unfortunately, the current condition of state politics is not foreshadowing something good.  Gerrymandering and wedge issues have  fostered a political culture that is locally sanitized and almost segregated.  I am told that Democrats frequently do not run candidates for Congress in Bakersfield, a growing city of 250,000 whose Republican Bill Thomas has been serving in the House of Representatives since 1978.  Despite the efforts of Republican candidates in San Francisco the House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is similarly untouchable, while Democrats are a presumed lock for all state offices.  Last March's primary election was a depressing joke, ratifying two imcumbents and a career politician running for State Senate with no significant opposition, and John Kerry's nomination was already a foregone conclusion.  It is amazing that something as dynamic as the recall election emerged from this stagnant public sphere, because it was the most powerful political competition California had seen in some time.  It frightens me that neglected and neglectful voters will return to sleepwalking.  It is also dispiriting to live in a safe district where your leaders are generally unaccountable because no one ever challenges them, and local oppositon is usually extremist.  San Francisco abounds with leftists who accuse the mighty Democrats of being insufficiently progressive.  In Bakersfield last fall, the local newspaper urged against very minor sales tax increases whose revenues would have been committed to public schools.  Anyone with any sense could tell you that both cities are crazy.  Then again, no one with any sense is speaking up consistently, and that is the problem.  Californian localities have demonstrated their aptitude at being needlessly polarized.  The center-left in Bakersfield and the Central Valley and the center-right in the San Francisco Bay Area need to wake up and remember that their votes count statewide and their voices should count locally (and not just on call-in talk radio programs.)  These days, each party should have a candidate, and each candidate should have a home page.  A Google search revealed no Democrat running in California's 22nd Congressional District against Bakersfield Republican Bill Thomas.  In San Francisco, Gail Neira is running for State Assembly but without a campaign website.  I have met Neira twice, and I have no idea what her stances are on key issues. Jennifer DePalma, who is bravely challenging Nancy Pelosi's Congressional seat, has also not filled out her own  urlLink positions  on the issues at her website, although one might find some of them piecemeal at her  urlLink weblog , which alas has not been updated since June 1.  Andrew Felder, my local Republican contender for State Senate, has dutifully listed a  urlLink few  of his stands on select issues.  Bill Jones has the most ambitious  urlLink website  of the lot, and he is still losing.  In the age of MoveOn.org, internet incompetence is the keystone of campaign failure.  On the bright side of things, there are other websites and a few months until the election.  The samizdat nature of the internet is still a potentially great thing.  Bakersfield has its own underground newspaper,  urlLink the Blackboard , even if it does not have a  urlLink credible  Democratic party.  I do not live in Kern County, and even if they are disagreeably far to the radical Left, good luck to the alternative press and  urlLink whomever else  is uneasy living in that one-party ghetto.  I must worry about my own.  In the Bay Area, Contra Costa County resident  urlLink Thomas G. Del Beccaro  runs the conservative activist weblog  urlLink Political Vanguad , mining the major news media and providing original commentary as well.  I had the pleasure of hearing Del Beccaro speak last week at a meeting of the  urlLink San Francisco Republican County Central Committee , and it's a shame that the room was not crowded.  Among other insights, Del Beccaro predicts that the Kerry/Edwards ticket will not win more than one major eastern swing state at great campaign expense; having lost several large swing states, West Coast Democrats will know they have been mathematically defeated and lose their will to have a large voter turnout.     In this scenario, Del Beccaro argues, Bush will begin to wear down Kerry after the Republican National Convention, since through the worst of times the Massachusetts Senator has persuaded few if any new people to like him or his politics.  Gradual economic recovery and consolidation in Iraq will give amiable President Bush the means to reach swing voters while his opponents gamble everything on rust-belt resentment and mostly lose.  Meanwhile in California, the Del Beccaro story continues, the equally unlikable Barbara Boxer will watch her poll lead collapse incrementally.  By election day, she and perhaps Kerry would be vulnerable after a Democratic loss in the Eastern time zone takes the wind out of Californians' sails.  It's an intriguing possibility, but I am worried that it relies so much on out of state developments and so little on organization per se out here.  Spiteful Democrats, after all, could rush to the polls in order to battle a victorious Bush and shore up America's third most progressive Senator, according to Boxer's rating by  urlLink Americans for Democratic Action .  In the interim, I would suggest practical measures like internet outreach to silent local constituencies as a better long term strategy.

      Freelance writer Charlie Crain is a good friend of mine now reporting from Baghdad and  urlLink blogging  about his observations.  His postings have a dark sense of humor and sobering unpretentious realism about human flaws on display in Iraq, like this  urlLink one  about a botched terrorist operation last week.  He has behind the scenes anecdotes about the Major Media in Iraq that you will not get anywhere else, stranger than fiction ethnographic accounts of the  urlLink paranoid style  in Iraqi politics, and a running naked eye appraisal of the strategic and tactical problems of social and military instability.  To interject my own second order conclusions from Charlie's dispatches, the insurgency is going to get a lot worse before Iraq gets any better.  Charlie fears that the new government and a public backlash against lawlessness and terrorists could mean the return of authoritarian rule.  Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, a former Ba'athist who survived an assassination attempt by Iraqi intelligence early in his exile, is especially eager to mobilize counterguerrilla warfare.    Can this portend well for the new regime?  Taking lessons from America's Cold War allies, I think it possibly could.  In the narrowest sense, even a weak democracy fraught with civil violence is preferable to a victorious revolutionary vanguard.  Peru under the liberal despot Alberto Fujimori was better off than it would have been if ruled by the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) or Movimiento Revolucionario du Tupac Amaru (MRTA).  The same applies to any of Colombia's governemts, Conservative or Liberal, especially in the last few decades; despite drug corruption, oligarchy and underdevelopment, that status quo is far superior to the alternative represented by the narco-guerilla FARC and ELN.  The same goes for monarchist Greece during its civil war with communist partisans in the 1940s--a struggle that gave birth to the United States' Truman Doctrine when that great president took over the duties of a bankrupted Britain in supporting a mediocre present against a bleaker possible future.  The lesson also applies to El Salvador, where the five guerrilla organiztions united by Fidel Castro as the FMLN lost their bid for revolution and eventually became a mere political party in the 1990s.  There are many more cases.  We know what the opposite outcome looks like as well: on a good day, a Castroist Cuba supported by the dollars of expatriates; on a bad day, Cambodia and North Korea under the genocidal Maoists or Afghanistan under the Taliban.  The revolution is dead in its populist Third World variety, and the world cannot tolerate additional zombie-like rogue states.  No new ones can be allowed to take power, and the older ones must be rolled back.  It may not be pretty, and an emerging Iraqi civil war could join the tragic annals of other such conflicts.  Make no mistake, however, the self-appointed guerrilla vanguards do not usually win.  In my Marxist days, I puzzled over why so few Castro/Guevara imitators won power in Latin America and elsewhere.  Since that time, I have not only better come to understand why not, but become thankful that they did not.  For starters, the old states that are most susceptible to revolutions are often dynastic, and Iraq is not anymore.  That fact separated the fourteen richest families of El Salvador and their many clients from the Somoza father-and-sons dictatorship in Nicaragua that was toppled by the Sandinistas and their popular front allies in 1979.  Saddam Hussein is on trial, his two boys Uday and Qusai are feeding the maggots, and Iraq's militiamen and uniformed security forces are no longer defending a Tikriti family business.  There might still be worry that Iraq will become a failed state, more like 1980s Lebanon or 1990s Somalia, but if a law and order mentality is growing on the street, if the Thulfiqar Brigades were quietly murdering Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army jihadists in Najaf this spring, and if the rest of the fractious country gets tired of forgiving the metropolitan blight that is Fallujah--well, it seems like the pushy mujahidin and retro-Ba'athists might have paupers' graves waiting for them while the rest of the country moves on.  Twenty six million people are not going to submit without a fight.  I'm counting on it, but it's going to be bloody and scary.  A weak-kneed press and homefront asking "are we there yet?" every five minutes will not make the trip any shorter or more pleasant, but we are not going to just turn this car right around if we hear one more peep out of those damned kids.  Destination: victory.  By the way, a belated Happy Indepedence Day to my American readership, with hopes that all my foreign audience also appreciates the eighteenth century revolution that brought the first successful model of a mature democracy into the modern world.  Even if a non-guerrilla Iraq cannot become one tomorrow, a semi-competitive developing democracy with strong patron-client relationships and ethnic and religious blocs is still a step up from their recent past and beautiful compared the rule of the Islamic fascist rebels.  Besides, who knows when the next pro-Western banana republic will turn the proverbial corner and become another South Korea or Taiwan or Argentina, a new liberal state that long knew the rule of generals and party bosses?  Even Chile's dreaded General Pinochet surrendered power in the late 1980s after a referendum; the communists (preparing  urlLink their own coup  at the time of Allende's ovetrhrow in 1973) never would have.  No one should ever say that war and democratization are processes without multiple steps.

           Forty years ago today, as the San Francisco Chronicle  urlLink reports , President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law, outlawing discrimination in public places.  It was the first of three such landmarks during his administration, followed by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and a law against housing discrimination in 1968.  Previously the East Texas populist Johnson had proposed several similar bills during his time as U.S. Senate majority leader in the 1950s; segregationist Southern Democrats had prevented each one from passing before the breakthrough of 1964.         Lyndon Johnson, perhaps the single most important white political ally of the whole movement, is often overlooked in the civil rights pantheon.  The end of Reconstruction in the 1870s and the rise of Jim Crow laws in the New South had halted many of the accomplishments of Lincoln in destroying the slave society and Grant’s no-nonsense counterinsurgency against the retro-Confederate Ku Klux Klan.  (The KKK was crushed so badly that it would not re-emerge in the New South until after D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film “Birth of a Nation” gave it a new patina of legitimacy.)  Harry Truman, also underrated, had integrated the military in 1947 and put civil rights in the modern Democrat platform the following year, inspiring South Carolinian Strom Thurmond to lead the segregationist Dixiecrat revolt and setting the stage for the subsequent political realignment of the American South.  Eisenhower, in deference to the Supreme Court, used soldiers to desegregate American schools and challenge resistant mobs.  Massachusetts liberal John F. Kennedy talked a good game, but was timid about civil rights and only briefly in office prior to his assassination.  Lyndon Johnson delivered more than any president in a century.       Some imagine that LBJ’s contributions are ignored because of “greater” disapproval for his escalation of the Vietnam War.  In my mind, this is a piece of a larger thankless attitude toward America’s thirty sixth president.  As the Chronicle article notes, the age of civil rights reform was also the era of massive black ghetto riots, with the latter portending the end of the former.  (Revolution from below?)  Johnson’s Great Society was the last major cluster of social democratic policies in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.  Nixon’s election in 1968 opened a long, gradual rise of a contrary conservatism that changed both major parties.  Perhaps some on the Left felt this coming at the time in the turbulent 1960s and have decided to blame the last New Dealer on duty for the end of Democrat dominance.       What I suspect is that Lyndon Johnson’s reformism was so generally successful that it elevated the expectations of radicals to unsustainable heights.  All of a sudden, in their eyes, the most important progressive president and “master of the Senate” appeared as a shabby gradualist who had not delivered enough.  (I must thank brilliant conservative political scientist Samuel P. Huntington and liberal former New Leftist John B. Judis, both Democrats, for much of this insight.)  Earlier in the decade, the Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee had struggled for exactly the sort of reforms that Johnson’s Great Society was enacting.  These organizations’ fates explain a great deal.       The 1960s were a revolution in Bad Judgment as often as anything else, one that made the outlandish Nation of Islam temporarily “respectable” against the “Uncle Tom” Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and his Southern Christian Leadership Council.   Trinidadian American civil rights leader Stokely Carmichael changed himself into the pandering, anti-Semitic pan-Africanist Kwame Ture.  In 1967, Carmichael threw all Jews out of the once-integrationist SNCC (under the pretext of punishing a victorious Israel), and one year earlier under the slogan of “black power” encouraged the formation of paramilitary Black Panther Parties for Self-Defense all over the United States.         Eventually, he merged SNCC with the most powerful of them, the Maoist Oakland, California party founded by street thugs Bobby Seale and Huey Newton.  Experiencing buyer’s remorse as the BPP descended into a factional war between Newton and rapist-turned-author Eldridge Cleaver, Carmichael then moved to dictatorial Guinea in West Africa, renaming himself after Ghana’s despotic independence leader Kwame Nkrumah and Senegalese counterpart Ahmed Sekou Ture, later dying in banana republican exile.       Luckily, SDS had transformed entirely from the anti-communism and non-violence of its 1962 founding Port Huron Statement toward instigating riots and advocating guerrilla warfare.  Cofounder Tom Hayden led one such “uprising” in Newark, New Jersey. Then with Seale, anarchist clown prince Abbie Hoffman, trust fund socialist Jerry Rubin and recently deceased “anti-war” activist David Dellinger he co-led the assault on the 1968 Democratic National Convention.  The clandestine Maoist Progressive Labor Party had joined SDS en masse in middle of the decade and absorbed it completely after the 1969 SDS national convention; the other leadership splintered and formed the Revolutionary Union and the terrorist Weather Underground.          Now think, did all of this happen because the civil rights movement and President Johnson had delivered nothing, or because of utopian and apocalyptic expectations of the New Left?  If the Vietnam War “drove them crazy,” it is their fault for appropriating the Marxist-Leninism that America fought against as their new guide and inspiration.  The movement only needed a few years to devolve from constitutional liberalism into totalitarianism.  They soon hated Johnson’s unprecedented domestic policy accomplishments as too little and demonized him for challenging Ho Chi Minh and other champions of Stalinist “liberation” abroad.  By 1968, the “anti-war” movement’s consensus was that Johnson was an enemy of “people’s revolution” rather than a great reformer.       It was the New Left’s mistake, across the board.
