      She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind Until the night He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I'll love her till I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The angels sang a whiskey lullaby The rumors flew but nobody know how much she blamed herself For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath She finally drank her pain away a little at a time But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind Until the night She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away his memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby...

      There's this guy I've been talking to, who shall remain nameless for the time being but...yeah, so we've been talking right? And he's not here, he's...well away. So I haven't met him yet, but what I know so far, I really do like. I'm confused though. When Scott left me I didn't think I'd make it, least of all be able to feel anything for anybody ever again. And here I am, doing it all over again, just asking for pain. It's only been 5, almost 6 weeks since he left and I feel like I'm doing something wrong, like it hasn't been long enough. And again, I know too that I'm just asking for pain with this guy. Eventually the pain will hit, it'll be good...then like it always does something will go wrong. Things are already wrong, but I don't feel like getting into that now cause then I sound like a selfish bitch so, we'll leave it at this for now.  Sometimes you just have to let your heart lead you, even if it's someplace you know you shouldn't be...

      Scott,  You will never read this, but you know me, you know my writing has saved me more than once.  I was driving yesterday and it just hit me all of a damn sudden. You're forgiven. Completely. I want nothing for you but happiness, and I do hope you find it. You deserve it. I'm sorry I wasn't the one that could make you happy. But you live and learn right? I still love you Scott. I'm not in love with you, no. But I love you all the same. I told you that will never change. Some things however, did change. 1) I am ok without you. 2) I'm actually kind of talking to someone right now. Those were the two things I said would never happen. I didn't think I'd ever take a chance with someone ever again, but I'm starting to, I think....maybe. It's complicated. I still think about you every day, still wonder if you're alright and if you're happy on your own. Are you? Are you alright without me? I wonder too if you're staying out of trouble. A lot has changed. I'm ok. For a while there I really didn't think I would be. I wanted to die. You know this. But pain is part of life, there'd be nobody here if everybody always gave up the first time they got hurt bad. So yeah, I'll get hurt again, I have no doubt. But the greatest risk in life is to risk nothing. I have to take a chance.  I'm seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself. That about speaks for itself. I can't elaborate anymore on that statement, you know what I mean by it.  Right after you left me, I'd hear those songs on the radio...like...You'll Think Of Me...and I remember thinking, that's gonna be me one day, one day I'll be ok with Scott being gone. That day has come. I'm alright. There's some things I'll never do again, like I'll never listen to our song again (Me and You). There's other things too. Sometimes it still hurts. Not because you left. Not because I still miss you sometimes. But because of what I knew and what I'll never know again.  I've said what I've had to say, Scott. I hope you find every happiness in life that you deserve and I hope you find someone that makes you truly happy.   You'll Think Of Me...   I woke up early this morning around 4am With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms I've been trying my best to get along But that's okay there's nothing left to say but.  Take your records, take you freedom Take your memories, I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.  I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been. So.  Take your records, take you freedom Take your memories, I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I'll be over you And on with my life.  Take your records, take you freedom Take your memories, I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.  And you're gonna think of me Oh someday baby, someday...

      Yeah. I am. I mean I'm really lovely, underneath it all. So why does everyone just want me for...other stuff and not me. Why's it gotta be that way? Why can't I be loved for me? Fucking shit fucker, I'm really a nice person if you get to know me.   "And I don't know if I've ever been really loved, by a hand that's touched me..."

      Hello there, the angel from my nightmare The shadow in the background of the morgue The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley We can live like Jack and Sally if we want Where you can always find me We'll have Halloween on Christmas And in the night we'll wish this never ends We'll wish this never ends...  I miss you, miss you...  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This sick strange darkness Comes creeping on so haunting every time And as I stared I counted Webs from all the spiders Catching things and eating their insides Like indecision to call you And hear your voice of treason Will you come home and stop this pain tonight Stop this pain tonight  Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)...

      So it's been 5 weeks and 1 day since Scott left me. I've been ok for the most part, but some days, like today, the memories are fucking making it hard to breathe. It's Sunday, Sundays were always mine and Scott's special time. I'd set my alarm for around 9:30 so I'd get up right when Dad left for church and I'd go wake Scott up and we'd cuddle and everything else. I was laying in bed a little while ago thinking about the last time he was here, remembering things he said. Right before he left..before he drove off he was like "Hey baby, I love you more!" That's bullshit...wasn't it? I like to think that at one time he really did love me. Sometimes I guess love just isn't enough, or sometimes maybe it's too much. I guess there's a danger in loving somebody too much. I remember too the first few days after he left me. That first night, I didn't know what to do, I thought about suicide, I prayed for death. I prayed he'd change his mind. I prayed that it was a bad dream. I remember sleeping in my parents room, tossing and turning all night. I remember praying to God and just saying "Please, please take me, I don't want to be here anymore." The next few days are a blur, I just remember wanting God to take me. That's enough, it's fucking enough. I can't take this right now.

      I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  Cause Im broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

      So here I am, at grandma's house because my parents can't take my bullshit anymore. It's all my fault, always is. I'm better off here anyways though right? Right. I'm tired of their shit as well. It'd be a hell of a lot better though if they'd just let me go. But they know if I go, I'm never coming back. And they're right. Long and weary, this road has been. Almost over. 6 months, 18 days, and I'll be done...

      Will she? I mean will I? Do I even believe in love anymore?  How can I ever again risk what I risked with Scott? How can I go through that again? I'm so confused. I'm not sure I can do it again. I'm not sure there's anything left to give to anyone else. And I'm afraid that if I try, it will all end in pain and I think if I had that pain that I felt when Scott left me...I'm not sure I'd make it out the next time. I don't think I'm strong enough. Sometimes I think I'm better on my own, but there's tons of things I miss. I miss that feeling of just being with someone, knowing that I wasn't alone. But if I'm alone then I can't get hurt. Why's it gotta be so hard like this? And you know, another thing, I'm tired of people using me for sex. And all the guys I've slept with, I was just trying to get someone to stick around and be there for me. But no more. Sex is overrated. I'm done with being used. And if someone would just give me a chance, I'm really a nice person on the inside. Someone just want me for me, someone love me for me...Here I am, As perfect as I'm ever gonna be, You'll see, Love me for me, Stick around, I'm not the kind of girl you wanna leave, You'll see, Love me for me...   Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved

      So yeah. Joey, like everyone else quit talking to me too. Why the hell am I STILL getting paid back for the wrong I've done? I've gotten more than my share of payback for what I'd done. God still hates me.  I'm getting out of here. I mean I'm going to talk to the Army recruiter sometime this week. I'm suffocating in this place. Memories Of Scott....hurt....I'm tired of it. Some days I'm alright. But then there's days that I just don't know what I'm doing anymore, don't know where to go without him. It ain't easy. So the Army's my way out, but it's more than that too. And the only reason I haven't done it is because I'm scared. I've been looking for something to stop me. Nothing has. Because I'm what's stopping me. My fear. I'm scared I'll fuck it up since I seem to fuck up everything else  What's that quote, from Where The Heart Is..."Our life can change with every breath we take..." Nothing's ever been more true. My only direction, my only purpose in life right now is joining up and getting out.    Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees.......
