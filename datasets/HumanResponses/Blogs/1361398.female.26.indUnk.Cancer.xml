      My horoscope today says "You are more attractive than you know". Oh really?!  Last night was the first of 5 weddings I am scheduled to attend between August and October. I was attending from the groom's side, an artist and dreamer whom I just met last year. Last night I finally met his new wife, and the entire experience was gorgeous, intimate and so meaninful. They had it in the backyard of a pretty majestic home in the suburbs, which was very well landscaped and sort of tiered with a brick path leading down to a circular firepit, where they had the ceremony. They washed eachothers feet first, and then took their vows. They stared so deeply into eachother's eyes the whole time, it was competely tender and real and very simple. Compared to the hour-long church ceremonies I am accustomed to, this was quite an eye-opening experience for me. Luckily I didn't have a moment to feel lonely or upset about my date who canceled a few hours prior to the event (a 'sorry' would suffice). Doesn't he realize some people would jump at the opportunity to date me?? Ha! Well needless to say I won't be inviting him to any more weddings.  I was changing Jack's very offensive diaper shortly after the ceremony and witnessed the newly married couple and their immediate family taking shots of whiskey in celebration...that's my kind of wedding. No shots for me though.  The bride's guests consisted of her colleagues from MPR, all of whom were very kind and intelligent. Jack was a bit of shocker to them (I think), but everyone seemed to enjoy his whirlwind presence. Someone asked who we were and I introduced ourselves and he said "Is there a third party to this?". I sort of didn't know what to say, but didn't feel bad necessarily either. I just said yes, but that we aren't together. (Too bad I couldn't pretend it was an immaculate conception like I ususally do.) We left at 8 just as things were heating up at the piano/karaoke and after Jack had his fill of sitting on a motorcycle parked outside.  Today we will go to the Uptown Art Fair and stop by Levi's house...last time I saw him at the jazz concert at my colleague's house he kept saying "I need Jenny!". I think he likes me. They invited us then to come over for the art fair and to park in their driveway, which is nearby. I think they were planning a lemonade stand. I haven't talked to them (practically strangers actually) but I think Jack would love Levi so we will surprise them. Hopefully I will have as good a time as I did last year.  Next weekend I will jet to La Jolla, CA for my good friend from high school's wedding. It will be another non-traditional ceremony, which I am very much looking forward to. We're going to the zoo too, and may meet up with my friend David who recently moved west.  This weekend my child learned to say "special" (in reference to his new  Very Vanilla Silk Soy Milk ), and "news" (as in no mommy doesn't want to watch cartoons, we're watching the news...). He's genius, I'm telling you.  Let's hear it for my first blog. I figured there was way too much going on in my life not to be getting some sort of drama or attention out of it.
