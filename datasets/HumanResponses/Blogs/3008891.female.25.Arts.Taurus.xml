						   i was looking through all my blog entries from the very beginning and i realize that i am getting very banal nowadays.  that is not a good sign.   the blog started out promisingly enough just the right number of jokes injected into them. now its a plain old account of day to day life. im getting embarassed by it. i gotta revv it up a little.  so anyway, i had a beer session with haydon. now the fella has also gotten hold of this blogspot addy as i had unwittingly told him that i had one. eep. i hope he doesnt re-think the friendship after getting a peek at what goes through my mind day after day.  anyways the talk i had with him was very re-assuring. he convinced me that i shouldnt be hung up abt carleton and to move on with the hawaii thing. it made me feel all the more confident to pursue my dream- the dream i had at the very beginning of third year in fact.  it was a good beer cum dinner session. i was telling him that i was likely to drop by in december to see him. the ulterior motive behind this visit is to get me a yale man. alright alright...i just want to check yale out. see what the hype is all about. also to take a look at the grad programme. and to see my very dear friend haydon. (and also to land me a yale man).  so its like 12 midnight now and im very tired. its hard to write in the blog at night. till next time folks.

						   some new girl is joining our firm for seven months.   she is on a training/internship programme. she looks nice. maybe i can have a new friend. and one who is a girl. i have way too many guy friends. she was wearing a baju kurung and looks conservative. i hope she doesnt balk at me too much. but she seemed shy and sweet. im tired of these bunch of fellas anyway, always having their own jokes and stuff..its good to have another girl in the office.  i decided to do the trekking thing for the upcoming 9th april holiday. karthik has agreed to join me. its gonna be good fun.  i feel like im wasting precious time. there is so many things to learn and do. and i only have one year and a half in singapore before i dash off to hawaii. learn computer, do lasik, finish my slimming sessions, join yoga and gym, learn video editing, get a website, visit all of thailand and indonesia, hang out with my mother, learn driving, learn chinese and arabic, visit a trichologist, do reading in NUS library, become a free lance writer..the list goes on and on...  boy am i living it up.  i feel all happy again. the week is fast coming to an end. wanna spend the weekend acting like a major sloth. sleep and read and sleep and watch tv and sleep.  yes i need sleep. usually karthik is always dragging me out on saturday. this is one of the few saturdays i have to myself. i better enjoy it. before that small man comes back.  i bet chris will want to do something though. i was supposed to accompany him to prem's party but as usual the girl has stood him up. i think i might give maninder a call. that girl has disappeared completely. maybe hang out in tampines.  today im meeting haydon for beer. im so proud of him as he just got an entry into yale. its well deserved. haydon was one of my closest buddies over at NUS apart from chris. his girlfriend vernie is quite the character. put together, these fellas keep me laughing for hours. she is in harvard now. they are the 'high flying' couple.  what i like about myself is my imagination. whenever i listen to music...or watch people go by, im immersed to the depths of my mind. i like that im introspective. also, i like that i dont take anything too seriously most of the time. i like that i have a sense of humor. most girls act like they have a pineapple up their ass and they can be ultra sensitive and all prim and proper. not me.  some folks tell me that im just so nice. and that its refreshing. i like that im like that. i want to be a down to earth sort of girl and it seems to be working just fine.  but i do have my faults. im really impulsive. and sometimes very naive. and terribly lost ... and i cry easily. and i can be too talkative sometimes and lack tact. and i lose my temper easily but then again i get over it easily too. and i never seem to know what i want. i am a poor decision maker. and i keep crying/brooding over spilt milk. ..  so there you have it- all combined makes paula. the small queen.  to other things.  boss seems fine with me now. thats good. whew. the bad spell seems to be fast dissapearing.  i miss my coldplay album. i want to get it back from whoever i lent it to. i need to buy more CDs. i love music. and i love writing.

						   i think im getting pms again. boys, dont read this entry.  its terrible , me and my hormones. I tend to get very depressed, my hair gets oily and i will burst into tears on the final day. then it comes. i call it 'the visitor'. the visitor usually stays for about four days. now many girls envy that about me, because the usual is 6- 10 days. what they do not know is that is the most godawful four days of my life accompanied by frequent weeping. also, that im in so much pain, i can hardly walk. the pain is very very very bad. my mom thinks i ought to see a doctor abt that pain. i need to see a gynaecologist anyway. im already 25 and i ought to start that pap smear thing. doesnt help matters that im still a freaking virgin though, i better talk to him about that too. i have no idea how they are gonna perform a pap smear with that.  i am serious abt pap smears because a friend of mine had a cyst and all that and they had to remove the whole womb. and she was only 22 at that time. and all because she didnt get regular pap smear check-ups. its scary. i wouldnt want my womb removed. i would like to have two children if i can (somewhere in the future) hopefully a boy and a girl. i have decided to name the boy sky. i think its a beautiful name.  actually i was thinking : sky daveenpaul . daveen is after my father who is baldev and paul after me. i hope my future husband agrees to it.  i havent figured what to name the girl yet. something pretty...   and they can be born in hawaii if i decide to marry a beach bum.

						   things are going well.   i have completed three chapters of my GRE book. I am very proud of myself.  also, I plan to eat a light thosai for lunch. with extra vege on the side. no coke. just trying to convince jim to get moving. arrgh, i need karthik back. he wrote to me today abt how is enjoying life in india. and something abt wanting to do it every year. hmm.  its funny how although subbu and karthik are best friends, they are as different as nite and day. oops i better stop here because subbu is a highly private guy and he wouldnt quite like my personal analysis of his character to be shown to the world. yeah well, lets just say they are very different but the best pple i know at the same time.  moving on to other things.   i am quite serious abt the website thing. i think i might just pay that hundred bucks and get it. this is how i rationalize it. i am computer illiterate and its affecting my work right. well. if i had a whole website to myself, i would want to design it and all that and the interest would be there to learn. and messing around with the computer would do nothing but good. i think i am gonna have a small queen website where i can put all my stuff on. pictures ..stuff from childhood..scan in things..it would be great. and i will do a lot of imaging and let my imagination run loose. simply awesome.  my birthday is coming in 22 days. i will be 25 years old. i dont think i will hold any party because i might as well stick to the tradition of never ever really celebrating my birthday. i think there is no need to do that. i dont like big celebrations. i mean i like other pple's celebrations, not mine. becos i hate to bring too much attention to myself. i loathe attention. i am not an attention seeker. and i can be a recluse too. all my friends attest to that. the rare day when paula appears at a party or outing... yeah i like it this way.  i dont like big gatherings. i like just having one or two pple at most. actually the minute there is 2 pple, i keep completely silent and get lost in my own world. that is the way that i am. i am very bad with groups. with just one person though, i can be lively and entertaining.  studying for the GREs makes the hawaii thing so real. i wonder if i should go in for next year's intake in july or wait out for one extra year and go in 2 years from now. hmm. maybe i should do it next year. i shouldnt take too long. if i do leave in june (this job i mean) - i would have been working here for say ..hmm feb - june: that is abt 1 year and 4 mths or so. i guess thats pretty alright. ..1 1/2 years instead of 2 1/2 years.  i will think abt it when the moment descends upon me next year. in any case i can always make my application and defer for a year if i feel im not ready yet. this time im coming in fully amored and ready. no panicking last minute over there.  the thing is that this place is softening me up. its like being in south carolina for a year and a half and then moving to new york. that would kill me. better to stay here for as less time as possible and move on with hawaii. and after hawaii , i can land another job before plunging into the phd ..arrgh..i know. or maybe a second masters in museology or something like that. prof kratoska recommended library studies but i think it has a lot of computer stuff in it and wont be up my ally at all...sigh hawaii....im gonna get lasik done so that i can do a lot of beach sports. also, to really work out in the gym to get an amazing bod prepared for the bikinis. hawaii here i come! look out.  later

						   Day 2 of Diet and Grad school.  Diet: I did not do well yesterday. bacon and tea in the morning. followed by teriyaki chicken at lunch. rice with 2 veges and sausages for dinner. 2 bags of potato chips and coke during the movie.  not good at all.  Today I had chapati with egg and orange juice for breakfast. gonna see how lunch and dinner go.  Grad school: the books are still lying on my desk. i had a firm resolution on my way to work this morning that i was gonna do at least one measly chapter today. god i hate the GREs. its a real pain in the ass.  as for the library membership, i did the dumbest thing by throwing away my alumnus card. now i have to go through a long process of doing this. shite. gonna get back into NUS library and hit the books every friday evening. and im gonna drag fairoz with me.  alright to other matters.  i hate monotonity. getting up and going to work. sitting in the damn mrt which i hate so much. taking such a long time to reach work. even at bugis station i still have to walk like forever to reach the office. i wish there was a direct bus. i wished i lived next to the place. i hate travelling. i wish i had a car.  9th of april is coming up. i wanted to go on a cruise with my mother. but she has work on sat. so im gonna ask karthik. perhaps we can do a budget airflight thing to thailand (bangkok, phuket, etc) . or we could take up an adventure holiday like trekking mount ophir or hitting some waterfall area or go to the national park. its gonna be great.   i decided that i want to set up a website where i can put on pictures and everything. im gonna see if i can land a website titled www.smallqueen.com. i would like to try out taking a lot of photos and pasting it on. also i was gonna take up video editing. i would so love to get myself a camcorder. all these plans. right now im just messing around with karthik's digital cam. its alright, good fun. i wish i had brought it along when issa was here and we were in tioman. i could have landed some awesome shots.   if i find that im really enjoying using karthik's camera, ill be a really amazing one for myself. and i would also get a camcorder before leaving for america. all good things to come. someday my great grandkids would go..now wasnt she beautiful and what a great life..  i wonder if this blog will be here forever. it would be so cool to check it out ten years down the road. here is paula at 24 going on 25. discovering herself. stating her dreams. having her diets and grad school applications. i wonder how things would be ten years down the road. i sure as hell did not foresee this life when i was abt 15.   alright i better get actual work done.

						   i have just returned from seeing a movie with subbu.  we watched 'the gospel of john'. it was pretty ok but very documentary style. i will refrain from talking about subbu because he is a highly private kind of fella, and also he seems to find the baring of my soul on the blog sort of disturbing. he is always going.."a lot of private stuff in there"...  i find that when im watching movies, i can get very introspective. i tend to think very deeply about my own life as well. its a session of serious thought. i emerge from the theatre feeling cleansed and serene at the end of everything.  the going to hawaii thing is making me feel like my life is finally coming to some direction. at least i wont have the carleton thing hanging over my head for the rest of my life. ..i was thinking though, what abt settling down and getting married and having babies and stuff..hmm..i know that its not what i want right now because i havent really lived life to the fullest. i was rather foolish in my undergrad years, always depressed and being a loner and all that ..and its only this year that i have finally emerged from my shell.  so i want to really see and do as much as possible before getting hitched.  im worried abt my life turning into a dreary monotonity. how do pple do it?- living the same life and being with the same job year in and year out? im amazed. the idea of working for rahmann for more than a year already fills me with dread. i wanna move about, see everything there is to see.  i know that my greatest hang-up is ending up like my mom. my poor long suffering mom that has always been too timid to try anything new. i dont want that and im trying my level best to ensure it.  i really havent 'found myself'. i know this is such an overused term. but really, ..i feel that there is more facets in me that i havent discovered yet. i want to rid myself of fear. only way to do that is to strike it out there all on my own. i dont wanna be afraid of being alone and i dont want to crawl into the comfort zone every time something happens to upset me. also i want to be more determined in chasing my dreams. also, i want have a better self esteem. i dont really have a good self esteem.  im feeling very sleepy now. tune in tomorrow .

						   so i went to NUS today.  i met with dr lockhart first and i spoke abt my hawaii plans and he thought it was a good idea.  i then spoke to dr aung thwin and he told me he would be over there in december and then i was welcome to join him and his wife and meet with the andayas. and he thinks that i have a pretty strong chance of landing a scholarship with hawaii.  all looks good for now.  im going to put carleton firmly behind me from now and move on. enough of brooding about it and feeling stupid and pissed. i have learnt my mistake and i sure as hell wont make it again. im being given a second chance to put things right with hawaii and boy, i will. i will work with a clear focus from now onwards.  it is gonna be M.A at Hawaii for 2 years. and a phd programme of seven years over at some other place- ivy league or university of michigan.  its all gonna be alright. i can feel it.  i know i cant keep working for pak rahman forever. it feels good to have a back-up plan. cos im not really 'going places' with this joint.  things arent all that smooth at work lately. boss is a little pissed abt my computer illiteracy. and i have sort of lost that cheerfulness i carried with me in the beginning and have gotten all sobered up. things have changed a lot this week.

						   Day One.  Mission: To lose weight and prepare for grad school  Diet: For breakfast, i had bacon, toast and tea. tomorrow ill skip the bacon, have toast and juice.  Grad school: I pulled out my GRE books and jawi book. i brought it to work. its lying on my desk.   all is going well.  gotta really focus on getting my GREs done. That is the first step.  Also I reviewed my resume today. it needs more work and perhaps one more recommendation letter.  Its a good thing that my thesis is gonna get published. im giving it the title i always wanted to give it: " Invasion of the mind: a study of the epistemological clash in colonial malaya"  the profs in the past thought it sounded way too harsh and it became 'the production and transmission of knowledge in colonial malaya'  that title does not kick ass. this one does.  and dr. alatas has approved of my new title. all is good.  later

						   i have always had a problem with sleep.  it isnt something that just popped out later in my life.  when i was a kid, i was bugged by constant nightmares.  then when i was older, i had vivid dreams.  also i couldnt simply sleep. there were certain positions. also the bed had to be right. some new place, and i wouldnt be able to fall asleep.  if i went drinkin, i would still wake up at 8 am even though i slept at four in the morning and ill be tired all day.  i still have vivid, disturbing dreams.  during honors thesis, i was on a strong cocktail of valium and stilnox to get to sleep. i had to see the doctor six times.  and i cant sleep in the afternoon no matter how tired i am.  i cant sleep on buses, trains or planes.  i hate to sleep unless i have no choice but to sleep. like right now. im evading the time i have to go to bed. but i do know that i have to go to bed.  the one thing that pisses me off most is when someone tries to wake me when i finally got to sleep.  i cant have any sound at all when i sleep. not even light music in the background.  i can never fall asleep before an exam. leads me to be tired and anxious during the exam. and out comes the valium and stilnox again.  its hard to fall asleep with someone next to me.  most of the time, i dream the strangest dreams...of pple..that i know..  i would give anything for a good night's rest.  my favourite beatles song is 'im so tired'- im so tired, i havent slept a wink. im so tired, my mind is on the blink. i wonder should i get up and make myself a drink. im so tired i dont know what to do...  i even went to church on two seperate occasions to pray for sleep. even had a priest pray over me once.  i have made three different pacts with God if he could make me sleep and ill be a good girl, i promise.  sigh

						   well things are looking up.  i got home and encountered fairoz on msn. now here is a guy with the same hang-ups as me about grad school. we got to talking abt our mutual dream to be malay world experts with a phD to back it up. and then it was decided. we shall meet every friday evening from 6.30 - 10.00 pm in the NUS library and work on some books. we decided to enlist the help of dr. lockhart to help us along. in the course of this, we can create an outline for our masters thesis. next year perhaps, fairoz will apply to NUS and i will apply to Hawaii. so its all set up nicely.  also we are going to learn arabic today which is important if i wanna do history. its an ancient language. he is gonna check it out.  i feel happy and perky again. i announced to my parents today that im returning to america next year. mom was apprehensive but dad was approving. i think i really need to do this. i need to chase my dream. i cannot let one setback ruin the rest of my life. i was meant to be an academic and by god's grace, i shall be one.  just thinking of studying again fills me with delight. i think hawaii is a good transition for me before i hit the ivy leagues. its either yale or university of michigan for my phD. just thinking of immersing my mind in post modernism again..sigh...its bliss...pure bliss...i want to study forever... and in beautiful hawaii too...sigh..... im so happy abt this latest turn of events and that i have a kaki who will motivate me every week. and im gonna write to dr aung thwin. he will help me out too, thats for sure. and he sure can give me some good direction.  this time, when i get there again, ill be all prepared and armoured. aint nothing is gonna get me down. i will make it out there. i believe it. im gonna work very hard from today onwards. no more playing the fool.   its time to get the old paula back.

						   I am now officially depressed. Someone please hand over the Prozac.  Firstly Issa has left town and with him some good memories of Carleton. I was supposed to get on that flight with him. Im supposed to be enjoying spring and not working my ass off in Singapore.  And today at work, everything went wrong and boss was not too happy with me. Especially that i was so distracted at work last week, trying to take issa around. and everything is piled up high on my desk and he is breathing down my neck.  Secondly, that my adviser and confidante, karthik is not in singapore and has gone to India. I dont have anyone else to talk to. It feels kinda lonely. I cant wait for the week to be over and for him to be back. he tends to be able to cheer me out of any situation. and now he isnt here and there is all the backlash of last week hanging on me. sheesh.  Thirdly, today i came to the realization that where i really belong is grad school and not this architectural joint. Im not really motivated by my work here. I really enjoyed school. I want to return to school. I want to get the phD. i wonder who will write my recommendation now that I have messed up with the carleton scholarship.  double sheesh.  life is sorta of bleak right now.

						   alright my official diet begins today.  it is monday, 29th of March. a historic day indeed. and all i had for breakfast was a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. actually that is not such a good thing because im supposed to have a hearty breakfast followed by light lunch and even lighter dinner. so, tomorrow, its juice, earl grey tea, toast and a sausage. and some eggs.  actually i wanna start getting up early. i hate being such a sloth and running around after 8.30 to reach work at nine. i wanna make my own breakfast instead of the maid making it for me. i would like to exercise in the mornings, perhaps hit the gym. if i could manage getting up at 7.15 or so, then i could exercise till 8. and get ready for work in a leisurely way from 8-9. that means i have to sleep around 11 latest to get my 8 hours. i think i could manage that.  so karthik has gone to india. jeez, there goes my regular lunch partner. i got to start dining with the folks from the office. sheesh, i like my lunches with karthik where we just laugh our heads off all throughout the hour. its a good break from work. oh well. just have to work it with manish and jim today. zai has gone missing completely. that fella has balls. for me, my one leave from work from thurs afternoon created quite a stir over here it seems. apparently boss kept asking abt me. hopefully he doesnt notice my tan.  im still drinking my gallon of water everyday to detoxify my body. not sure whether its working or not. wayne told me abt some kick ass blood-type diet. that you have to eat according to your blood type for maximum results. i have heard abt this from rhommell once. he told me that as a B+, i can take plenty of dairy. and its true that i love dairy. anyways the addy wayne gave me for this was www.dadamo.com. so if anyone is interested, check it out.  right now, im just sipping on my water to stall my hunger. i decided to really cut down on the carbs and meat. that means half a plate of rice instead of a full one and to finish only 3/4 of my chicken without the skin on it. and to take 2 helpings of vege. and never to touch coke for as long as i shall live. ill take more fruit juices. gonna venture into papaya juice this week and perhaps watermelon too. im tired of dull old orange juice all of the time.  yeah and i have to cut out fast food completely. its really bad and tastes like plastic anyway. i have to start taking more fish. perhaps ill get some from the mart today and make some baked fish with lemon and dill sauce followed by some roasted potatoes and greens. that can be good. or perhaps ill steam the french beans with some herbs seperately. i dont think u can actually bake french beans. but i think i can place a steam like thing over in the oven with the fish and the potatoes and place the french beans in it.  yesterday's cookies came out well. we made macadamia and chocolate chip. it smelled wonderful. then poor chris had to sit with my father while he went on and on abt christianity and the sad life of singaporeans. my aunt and cousin dropped by unexpectedly. i have no idea what they would make of some german boy sitting at my front hall, considering that the punjabis are ultra conservative and there is no such thing as one having guy friends. they seemed taken aback at first and then everyone settled in nicely.  gee i would so like to grab some lunch now. im very hungry. but manish and jim like to go after one usually. jeez. im at the mercy of these fellas now that karthik has left. the pain..oh the pain..

						   well its been a while. i have just returned from tioman.  it was pretty swell..however i was in a rather pensive and brooding mood most of the time there. i sorta got lost in my thoughts a number of times. i was probably really bad company for issa. he was talking a heck of a lot about carleton and it sort of brought back some good memories of the place and that made me feel lousy about leaving. i mean it wasnt so bad, and had i given it some time, i would have made some swell friends too. oh well, its over and there is nothing i can do about it. all i can do is learn from the whole thing, pick myself up and try again. i know i can do it.  right now im at home. chris wanted to go out but the idea of getting dolled up on a sunday to hit the streets didnt appeal to me much. i invited him home to bake cookies and pizza with me. later, ill hit the east coast beach for a bout of cycling.   i really enjoyed the tioman trip though. i decided that every weekend, im gonna fly out somewhere. especially with the whole budget airway thing being launched, ill be able to afford to. i want to go to indonesia, thailand and malaysia every weekend. i think i can pull it off. its a good break for me and it sure gets me revved up for the week. its healthy and worth the investment.  yes im pissed abt leaving carleton but on the other hand, im having a swell time in singapore. the job gives me spending power which means that i can afford to have a really good time travelling and stuff. and the job is exposing me to a great deal more than carleton ever could. maybe i wont do grad school after all. perhaps ill just work on my career. land myself a job out there in the big wide world. i know this whole thing as an ahem ahem, historian, wont last for long. i mean not with this company anyway cos my prospects for growth over there is kinda limited. it makes for a great first job though.  i need to do some computer courses and stuff. i want to take up adobe photoshop and do video editing. stuff like that can be really cool. i was talking to issa abt the possibility of doing a road trip someday in america. it would great to videotape the whole event. im gonna see if habib can impart some skills to me. manish for photoshop and habib for video. that would set me up nice.  its a lovely sunday afternoon. its funny how i used to hate sundays as a kid. even in uni, i would pack my books up at 8 am and hit the library until 6 in the evening. only these days im beginning to like sunday. it aint so great over at my parent's though. this morning they started quarelling again and it sort of reminded me why i used to hate the weekends so much. its because they are in such close proximity to each other. i really want to move out but it seems that they have got me pinned here.   thats why i have this whole hang -up about marriage and boys and stuff. i have seen firsthand how the wrong choice of a man can lead to a disastrous life. i really have my guard on when i meet fellas, every little thing is magnified.   right so im gonna surf the net for good airline deals. ..

						   so i went clubbing yesterday- all part of the 'take issa around to see singapore bit'  it was alright. all the indian guys were at home watching the cricket game though so there wasnt much to see guy wise. i like indian guys. they are smart, funny and interesting. and most importantly they have something that the white guys and sporean guys dont have and that is the 'survival instinct'. now with an indian guy, if the going gets rough, he will know how to get us by. the sporean guy will look blank and go "like that ah? how come can like that? wah how ah?" the white guy will go "its ok babe, we can get by..just chill alright" and we end up on bloody welfare, living hand to mouth. yeah i'd go for the indian guy anyday. he has the resourcefulness to pull us through anything.  there are a couple of things that needs to be changed though.   number one: the obsession with cricket. its almost manic. they should list cricket as an indian religion. its alright to dig cricket but be cool about it man. dont get manic and curse and swear and send spits flying in all directions.  number two: now that we talk about the spits, yep. when they get excited thats it. verbal banter at its most extreme. spits flying everywhere. this is a no go with singaporean ladies. they have to learn to take it easy.  number three: the shirts of so called 'top quality' from india. they look tacky and out of the eighties. the shirt sleeves cover half the arm. just go to wisma atria, pick up a valentino or something. you can afford it.  number four: the thinking in terms of rupees thing. like come on, you are in singapore already. we are sick and tired of hearing how expensive our things are compared to whats it worth in indian rupees. it makes you look cheap.  number five: asserting constantly that india beats all . its the best place. the food there is the best, the culture there is the best. scorning everything abt spore in the whole 'india is best' attitude. then what the hell are you doing here then? go back to india since its so great.  number six: not wearing a good cologne and aftershave. most of them dont bother with it at all and they do smell pretty strong too. a major turn off. some of them get the funny smelling stuff from india - its awfully pungent and just as bad as natural body odour. go to tangs. get a polo sport aftershave and cologne. please do us and our noses this favour. thank you.  number seven: the stupid school bag/backpack that you carry along to work. get a sleek briefcase dudes. please not the school bag/backpack thing on your shoulders. god...  number eight: using 'yaar' at the end of every sentence. you dont like our 'lahs' and we dont like your 'yaars'. period.  ok im done for now.   so indian guys are really great and everything. but please guys, do something abt those eight points. it will do you a world of good.

						   hello everyone.  so issa has landed. i was a little apprehensive at first. i did not want another, "oh why did i leave carleton session in my head". but amazingly, i feel pretty alright. he gave me a sweatshirt that has carleton on it. i was happy with my gift. im gonna wear it proudly. the six week student of carleton college, minnesota. actually come to think of it, i wasnt having a good time over there. it was really really dull. and also, it was way too cold. minnesota is basically the freezer section of the USA. so it aint so bad that i left after all. i prefer singapore.  to other matters.  im feeling extremely tired today. did not sleep very well yesterday. maybe my insomnia has returned. i sure hope not. i was tossing and turning and sleeping very poorly. just like how things were in carleton. i sure dont want a 'repeat episode' of that. maybe issa has brought the insomnia bug with him from america to infect me with. heh.  i need a pep up. i need to get out and go to tioman. just to relax that poor ol mind of mine.  later guys.

						   well im back.  im planning a good trip this coming friday. really need to relax and enjoy the beach. just thinking of lying on the sand is making my toes curl in delight. the fact that i worked right up to sunday and went to work on monday is just too much for a burn out. plus im being made to work day and night on an important upcoming project.  so its all justified.  i ate some thai food with chris yesterday. usually thai express never fails but yesterday's fare was really bad. it wasnt even spicy at all. i should have just gone to the hawker center instead. nowadays the coffeeshop food seems so much better than these swanky places. even today, i had thai food at another swanky place. it was terrible. and i spent a lot for the terrible food.  i havent tried a single japanese restaurant yet. all the udon and all that doesnt appeal to me much. i only like teriyaki chicken. but to pay fifteen bucks for teriyaki seems a little too much. i might as well just make it at home. why is japanese food so damn expensive?  i have discovered that korean food can be very good. with the exception of kimchi that would take me a long time to get used to. their stirfried chicken is really very tasty. as for indian food, for south indian i find apollo banana leaf pretty good. for north indian...hmm jaggis turned out to be pretty standard. bokhara in clarke quay is amazing but very pricey.  as for western food..hmm..i have never been a pasta fan. i find the food at american bistros like hard rock incredibly boring...ok kenny rogers in an exception, man i love kenny rogers chicken. i wanna try out some good steakhouse like outback steakhouse or tony romas. and im not the biggest fan of nydc or swensens which everybody seems to love.  i bought this book called : life eats, a guide to singapore's best eating places. i plan to try out all the best hawker fare listed on it. with issa visiting, i can take this opportunity to show him Singapore's finest. like i said, hawker fare sure beats all the designer food at restaurants any time. he should get to taste all the authentic stuff.  alright im running off to arab street for tea and to get some material for making a kebaya. lets hope ill be able to still fit into that despite all the eating i have been doing...

						   i realized that i have changed a lot. this revelation came after lunch with a close friend today.  its true that after the whole graduate school saga, and me getting this job, i have changed. i have become somewhat superficial in my pursuits. in the past, work completely consumed me. i spent days and nights, holed up in my hostel or the library ..working on book after book..my work completely obsessed me..i was constantly pondering, writing articulate pieces...nothing else came into focus then and i loved it then. my personality naturally suited my work, i was very serious, practical and focused. i hardly shopped or went to town or a restaurant or anything..i hardly indulged myself. the books and the work was my opium and i was completely addicted.  and then came this job..as an ahem, ahem historian. and i started earning money. and im not hooked to the sort of work i do here. i mean its a great job but it does not really excite me the way academic work does. so i started looking into other things.. somewhat mundane superficial things- getting my hair done, the best place to eat and so on. and this has slightly irritated my friend. he finds me being careless with money and not as focused any more. apparently i have hardly anything interesting to say as well. perhaps im turning into your regular female bimbo these days. after all , im hardly using my brain anymore. the working world is like a monopoly game.- its all about how you present yourself, the amount of bullshit you can cram into your reports, stuff like that.   i used to be an idealistic girl. i use to believe in love very strongly. however after the whole rajpal saga, i sort of lost faith in that and i admit i have become highly cynical. the whole thing had got me depressed for abt 6 months and i emerged from it hardened... gone were my lofty love fantasies, i looked at men through a different lens.   i use to love academic work and i was highly idealistic about that too. pursuing knowledge for its own sake..gosh how i loved it...my mind kept getting challenged and pushed out of its traditional boundaries to further realms. i romanticised that whole experience in my head...and then the carleton saga sort of crashed that... that love for academia, that burning passion has waned. its replaced with a hard feeling now..right there in the pit of my stomach. i look at academic journals with a wariness now ..and i dont engage in any proper debates or challenge someone else's views...i just feel like crawling into a small hole and staying put in it. and bothering abt the little things like whether guccis are the best brand of shoes a girl can buy.  so from a serious, somewhat somber and intense girl..i have turned into a careless spender, somewhat carefree in my ways and not taking anything seriously at all. that is quite a change indeed.  my talk with this friend and the things he had to say to me sort of depressed me a little today. i dont know what to make of what he has told me..but ill take it in my stride and think about it. funnily enough he probably thinks i dont give a damn because thats the impression i gave him and have been giving him, sort of tossing it aside with a laugh. but deep inside, im highly troubled.   truth is that the grad school thing has sort of made me feel like a failure..yes pple, a failure.. its a shadow hanging over my life. im engaging in whatever that will keep my mind off it. i just talk abt the mundane..i smile and laugh....i dont wanna get depressed abt it. but its there..every night before i sleep and every morning when i wake. its casting a long shadow over my life. its always there, this tight feeling in the pit of my stomach. and no matter how much money i spend and whatever i do, its not dissapearing. i dont know what the hell to do. i'd give anything to have given this another shot. its just sick..really sick.. i just feel like not taking anything seriously anymore.. i wanna be left to my so-called superficial pursuits. it sure is better than beating myself abt it like what was happening in december. ..

						   the monday morning blues. something that does not affect me because i love my office and the pple in it. they are really a great bunch of people. and i just love arab street- its so quaint. so i actually look forward to returning to work on monday. what i dont like is the waking up every morning. sigh. its terrible. i get a first class wake up call from my dear mother every morning- "kakaji (grandson) wake up now..you are getting late"  so why am i called 'kakaji'? well its a fond nickname given to me when i was born. my grandparents were really rooting for a boy and my being born brought some degree of dissapointment. nevertheless, my dadima insisted on calling me kakaji (perhaps she thought that it would miraculously transform me into a boy) and the name stuck with everyone. . my mom calls me that in fond memory.  i had a good childhood (at least until my brother was born and we had to move to tampines)  living in orchard court and being the darling of everyone was great. i was spoiled rotten by my grandparents..and i was given a great deal of attention by the neighbours and my dad's sisters who also lived with us. living in orchard road meant a good life. my dadima would take great cares to make my favourite food everyday- fried liver in pepper, caramel custard and freshly squeezed orange juice. she took me out all the time in her little red sports car..i still remember her stylish sunglasses and the way her gold bangles would clash against each other as she maneuvered the gears. we had a good time, me and my dadima.   i was her darling even when i was all grown up. because i was the only one practically raised by her among the grandchildren, i was basically the apple of her eye. admittedly, she was a very capable and beautiful woman. and also very ahead of her time. she prided herself on being 'modern'..she was the one who chose my name. (with great care, i might add) she thought the name 'paula' was very elegant. my nanima from punjab almost had a heart attack because the priest had commanded that my name start with a 'K' and she had come up with kiranjit kaur which was a no go with my dadima....dadima had her way in the end as she always does. she was a very strong and domineering sort.  i do miss her very much and i wish that she lived on long enough to see how much i have accomplished. but in a way, its good that she has been spared the horror of what my brother has become.   my brother being born and our move to tampines put an end to most happy things. it was only when i was about 19 or so when i started feeling good again. that corresponded with my entering uni and later getting the pgp hostel room. that began my happy days. the phase between our tampines home to university is just a blur to me now and something i would much rather forget. but it has strengthened me in some ways...and i definitely do not take anything i have right now for granted. i have learn to appreciate the little things that life has to offer.  alright folks, till next time. tune in for the next episode of the 'days of paula's life' around noon.

						   and so you're back..from outer space, i just walked in to find that look upon your face, i should have changed that stupid lock and just thrown away the key, if i knew for one second you were ought to bother me..lah lah lah.... ( i love this song, usually when i get back from somewhere i sing with gusto, replacing "you are back" to "i am back)  anyways.  its 11.45 pm and this is the first time im writing from my room instead of the office. now this thing doesnt really become a 'diversion' unless im at the office. at home, its just a chore. this is gonna be an exciting week however, i can feel it in my bones.  indonesia was a blast. i ate too much as usual but that is no big matter. boss was truly amazed at me. now that is a warning signal when my boss gets amazed cos boy can he eat! so its a sign that i have to cut off some of my helpings. everytime i have a dinner out with friends, it becomes a grand affair...good food followed by iced chocolate with whipped cream and a cheesecake. it has to stop, i know that.  its good to be back. its funny how im beginning to be happier about being singaporean these days, especially after visiting the other southeast asian countries. the place i went to..gosh the parents are really trying to get their kids into singaporean schools- an education that i used to take for granted cos it was handed to me on a silver platter. i am grateful these days though. things are going well, i have a good degree in my hand. i feel like king of the world!  gosh im so so tired. had a really long flight and everything and i still have to get in to work tomorrow. gee im getting burned out by this job. im planning a really relaxing weekend though.   i miss my honours classmates. been talking to fairoz and shahrom quite a bit and thats it. im gonna give james and yihan a call pretty soon. as for danny boy, the last time i talked to him, he was on the verge of suicide and told me to leave him be. thats the usual scene with daniel. i dont actually remember a time when he wasnt high on prozac and contemplating killing himself. but i like him though. he is one of the interesting ones.. dares to be different. ..a nutcase, but he was one of my best pals then... im drawn to nutcases. i dont feel alone in the world with pple like that. gonna call him soon and try my luck.  ok im gonna hit the sack. dont go weeping though..i promise ill have more stuff tomorrow (end of transmission)

						   alright its my fourth entry of the day. all prepared for indonesia. life is good.  nowadays i take a gallon of water because its supposed to clear my system very well and 'detoxify' the body. yes folks, i am now fully entrenched in these sorts of health habits. gone are the pgp days when i ate crap and sat in one chair all day long. jeez, i really worked hard for those awards and that damn cert. they stand me in good stead now of course, but the shit i had to do..makes me shiver just thinking of it. and i plan to go to grad school on top of this. someone please stop me from literally killing myself....  my mom is going at me to get married. the typical thing among indian families. girl hits 25 and she is considered an old bird, needs to get married, time is ticking, what abt babies. gee i dont wanna get married, not for a long time anyway. i just want to live life. i have finally crawled out of the shell and i see the light .i see the light...dont thrust me in the darkness again..arrgghhh  funny thing is that i have become very commitment phobic. no kidding. i really feel very wary of fellas who chase me with the intention of making me their proper girlfriend. im like no way, it aint happening dude cos im happy as hell being single. i dont have good memories of my past relationships anyway.  talking abt past relationships, i had the strangest dream about rajpal last night. considering that this is the fella i was nearly gonna marry at one time, i think it justifies the dreams i tend to have. last i heard, he was working for the ministry of foreign affairs. i really dont know how i feel about the fella now, i just pray that i never bump into him..i wouldnt know what to say to the fella. it will just be so awkward. but i gotta admit i have never been so hung up on any guy the way i was hung up abt raj. i am learning to put him and that relationship behind me and just move on. its hard sometimes but i try... i do know that nothing would have come out of that union, we would have just made each other incredibly unhappy.  to lighter things, it has been raining very heavily. i love the rain. i love cold weather. its lovely. its raining now. its lovely.  i want so much to pick up a car and drive around. i hate the public transport. lemme say it again. i hate the public transport, especially the mrt. uggh.   ok ok., i have this big indonesia trip coming up.  later.

						   well im back from lunch.  cant write much cos i have a lot of work to do. but my stomach is feeling full now. so for five mins im gonna give the good ol geezer a break and then get it running. anyways, im taking the geezer to a slimming center to get it toned up. its called 'the slimming sanctuary'. i like the way it sounds, i can almost hear the birds chirping. spent a hefty 350 bucks for 33 sessions at this place- my mother almost died. "why do u need to go to a slimming place, you are already slim, whats wrong with you?"..i hear that daily now. why oh why did i leave america to stay at home in tampines with my folks? i must be mad indeed.  well they promised me a slimmer stomach and a tight butt. guaranteed at least three inches off. how could i resist. i have been working on my stomach and butt for years. i just wanna try this out. doesnt hurt to be more slim i guess.  but its true that i am spending money too easily these days. i really ought to cut back and save a bit. been getting my clothes tailor made, went to an expensive hairdresser in orchard to put in gold highlights, eating at restaurants all the time..buying shoes like there is no tomorrow. taking cabs everywhere.. doing the whole manicure , pedicure bit. buying tons of health products, the list goes on and on and on... its terrible. i will save more.  it will happen. i cant get addicted to this lifestyle for too long.  have i said it often enough that i love my job. i love my job. i really do. its the best job in the world. its just great. i love it. i love it.  my dad keeps poking his head into all my affairs these days. "where are you going, what time will you be back, what are you doing, why are you wearing that, are you sure you arent drinking and smoking out there...? god. what have i done. why did i forget all about this? im 25 and im still a kid to these pple. i tried to move out. they almost died. " you think you are some westerner? we dont do things like that in asia. also, you are a female you understand?" my mother even invested $1500 on the most expensive king koil bed around to be put in my room so that i never think of leaving. god...  i want to do something crazy. maybe become a model or join miss singapore universe. or maybe become an actor- doing those artsy films. or maybe become a freelance writer for some newspaper or something. i dont know. i want to do something thats for sure. i cant just be an ahem ahem 'historian' and thats it...im sure i have many varied talents that i ought to explore.  alright. there is a LOT of work to do today. i better run off and do it.  till later...smooch...

						   i know i just wrote in this blog some fifteen minutes ago. but i couldnt help myself. this thing is like a drug.   alright im sitting in my office now. i was supposed to be swamped with work. but im hungry. and its not lunch time till 15 mins later. i cant work when im hungry. so here i am at my welcome diversion.  what i like abt going to indonesia is that we eat so much. also that i get to read some books along the travelling time. i love books. i picked up some good ones at the national library yesterday. something about books, once you get into the story. thats it. you lose track of the world. its just you and the book. i like that feeling. transcending into another realm. a place where all the outside hustle and bustle doesnt reach you. you are completely ensconced in another place. its just cool. like drugs, but only healthier.  and food..hmm ..i love food. i love to cook and i love to eat. someone once said that one who loves to eat demonstrates a real passion for life. someone else once said that one who loves to eat has a healthy sexual appetite too..oh well.. im definitely living it up compared to the skinny things that just order salads.   so i was talking to prakash who is like in bloody australia right now and im thinking he really should come to singapore for a while. seems wrong that he is completely renouncing the country due to some bad experiences over here. i for one do enjoy singapore. the whole wanting to go out of this place thing is all abt personal growth. ultimately ill return . i know that.  i really liked prakash because he was so much like me in so many ways. but we were both at the wrong phase in our lives..and so the thing just didnt work well with the both of us...the constant fights and anger..gosh how young we were then, ... now that i look back at it , it all seems so silly.. i appreciate that we have some sort of friendship going though. its nice to have pple who knew you in your yesteryears around you to see the change.  alright my stomach is truly growling. later folks. (and now back to the show)

						   today im so completely swamped. leaving for pekanbaru tomorrow. writing in here is a welcome relief. im rediscovering my love for writing actually...maybe i ought to really go into journalism. anyways.  issa is coming down next week and i have to think of places to take him to. after raving on and on abt singapore over at america, i better show him a good time. been planning a careful itinerary. im thinking, screw the 'touristy' stuff like sentosa and all that bullshit, im gonna lead him into the life of a heartlander instead- coffeeshops, sitting around town..stuff like that..gonna show the yankee what singapore is all about.  so here is the topic on my mind today: TEMPTATION. yes pple, it beguiles..its desire..its a strange inhumanity.... TEMPTATION.. its consequences are great..but the nectar it yields is so sweet... it is there for a fleeting moment...and the marks stay forever....  alright hindi drama aside (im indian, can you blame me?) i realize that im a real sucker when it comes to temptation. when im put in the situation, i usually yield. i go for it. even if the consequences means me getting literally killed. i go for it. its terrible i know. but i cant seem to help it. once its rooted in my mind, thats it. i will go for it. i will fight all the odds to go for it.  so is this the flaw in my character?  or am i perhaps...dark and dangerous..hmm... im definitely not your classic good girl.... what does it say about ethics and all that jazz though.?... i hate being the classic good girl..

						   well i just got in the office, and i was trying to figure out when is the best time to write in the blog. i really felt like writing right away, and then thought, nahh i should do it middle of the day and then i was thinking and thinking and what the hell...why dont i just pull in another three entries like the last time. so here i am...writing..  it was a pretty surreal morning. was dreaming of when i was in carleton (ok folks, i know im obsessed with this thing, just bear me with me)..actually i wake up most mornings with a memory of carleton...im trying to figure my life out a little... where will i really be happy at..karthik told me that the environment does not impact on happines- that it is a state of mind- and though i see how his theory warrants some merit, i am inclined not to fully agree...i mean what if you had really terrible parents and a terrible house environment and stuff...are u as happy as the fella next door who has a better family life?..i mean surely the environment impacts one's state of well being...though yes, it is a state of mind as well. i think it takes both factors to determine it...  so anyways..im on the bus, im looking out at the HDBs...little compartments i have lived in my entire life and wanted to get out of....and im thinking, will i really be happy living here all my life like a 'katak bawah tempurung' (frog under the coconut shell)... i really dont think so. i just need to get out there one more time. ..or its like ill never get over it. thats what professor kratoska told me: that if i dont go out there one more time and try again, its gonna hang like a shadow over my life. and really he is right, cos i feel like i have unfinished business with the united states of whatever. ..so im just gonna work hard with this goal in mind , and you know what, it puts a spring in my step just thinking about that.. i feel like i have some great goal to work for now and it motivates me to get up every morning..( i used to need boyfriends for that, gee how times have changed)..  and talking about karthik,..he is really one fascinating creature. i mean he claims to be happy all of the time,. but i cant help thinking that it is somewhat a facade at certain moments, something he needs to hold on to..to feel secure abt his life. ..perhaps saying it often enough will make him believe it or something when the going gets rough.. i have given him this analysis before and he has pondered...  and perhaps one day he will agree to the fact that there may be an element of truth in what i think- or perhaps he really is a super-happy fella and hardly anything gets him down.. a state of mind eh...   if i was in one of my university tutorials right now, we will be talking abt the constructed notions that pple come up with to make sense of their world...and there is no real 'truth' out there..like even the 'state of mind' theory is nothing true yet nothing false..nothing but a construct really. so here is karthik, using a theory he feels best to make sense of his world- there is no element of truth in it, it sort of boils down to the psychology of the human mindset...and then we we can deeper into it and say there is no such thing as happiness either- another construct..another thing we use to make sense of our world ..to give a definition to something.....gosh i do miss post modernism.  but i really like the theories that karthik comes up with. this is one fella that i feel i can learn plenty from. its great to have him as my best friend.. he really tends to get me thinking about many things... i like the intellectual debates that we sometimes get into...  well manish has come in and wants to talk cricket...jeez what do i know abt cricket..but anyways ill try to humour him for a bit..

						   alright, this is my third entry of the day. I am really having a blast with this online diary. (also that i pretend to work, while quietly getting on this as a welcome diversion). The others who i informed about the diary werent as negative as shahrom... though i did get a 'cute' from issa which just made me feel plain dumb about it... but anyways, as long as im enjoying myself..  so on to more important things. im gonna do the whole 'lets figure out where my life is heading' bit because it makes a very apt third entry and i want to be seen as someone that has a handle on things....NOT... ok ok, i admit that i used to be really serious and very much on the ball with things like this but after the whole carleton saga, i just dont know. i mean i thought i was really heading somewhere at that time and i had big dreams and all that and i have been pulled back on ground now. i feel that i definitely need to try to get to america one more time just to prove it to myself that i can do it. and to find closure to the whole experience. and also to find out what the big deal is all about with america..  so i have this whole plan in mind- its titled 'The Two Year Plan'- basically that im getting to new york in 2 years after being,....ahem ahem, a 'historian' for this architectural firm. i have no idea what im gonna land there but anyways its worth the shot i think. its definitely better than sitting in my hdb flat every morning, sipping my tea, and having my father give me disbelieving looks and making statements like 'i cant believe you can gave up such an opportunity..i mean you were out there girl..what the hell were u thinking coming back here.."... he's right, what the hell, i need to get out there again...just for the sake of doing it.  just been doing a 'no comment' to the sikh press (if u know what i mean, family members etc) and a 'im happy now and it aint over' to close friends... and yeah i have to admit that i am happy now..never been happier in fact. its like i have been cured from a long debilitating disease and i cant believe it had to take me through this kinda thing to have me be a completely happy, well adjusted creature. im just gonna really live life from now onwards..

						   alright, i was just messing around a little more, realized i had no idea how to edit my very first entry ..so here is my second entry of the day. now many of you must be wondering why this is called 'the small queen'. quite simply, that has been my nickname for the past 3 years. One guy that i dated for a while came up with it- and the name stuck with everyone. whenever i tell anyone new that: hey, i had this nickname..they go: yeah, its so perfect, im gonna start calling you that too...   now why is this perfect, you may ask. well you have to get to know me better i suppose- it has something to do with the the fact that i can be vulnerable and yet very ambitious at the same time.  so this diary thing- i was thinking it had a lot to do with the fact that i took up history as a subject and am now ahem, ahem, a 'historian'. thing is that historians love to read chronicles and things like that and an online diary sure fits the profile of a modern day young historian like myself.  my friend shahrom told me that he thought pple who had online diaries were a little narcissistic- in the sense that they get a kick out of spilling everything of all to read. well, i dont know abt being narcissitic..whats funny is that im actually a very highly private person and now here i am writing it all out. i dont know, its just sort of fun to put my two cents worth out there in the net... yes shahrom, i guess i get a kick out of it,..jeez im a nutcase...

						   well right now im just testing this thing out..its interesting that a completely computer illiterate person like me is actually getting an online diary. oh well..lets see how this thing works out. like most diaries, since i was the age of five, i never quite managed to keep up with it after a month or so (kinda like how things are with my boyfriends ;)- but anyways, being 25 , its time to take up some RESPONSIBILITY. thats right folks, its the 'R' word (shiver shiver)... so if i can do this, i should be able to keep a boyfriend .. heh if only life was so simple...

						   i didnt go for photography class. that is because 'the visitor' is here again after 28 glorious days. I will only be fine on monday.  so i dont know now. i mean so much for the whole photography class thing, i missed three already. i know very little about photography now. (sob, there goes all my dreams of being a world class photographer).  so the thing is that i might become a journalist. well just for a while, im not going to say more. lets just say that the idea has been playing around in my head a bit. i happen to be a good writer (please do not take this blog into account).  apart from that, work is becoming somewhat laggy in the office. im supposed to do this whole write-up on agricultural technologies. its killing me slowly and surely. i mean agri technology??!! u gotta be kidding me.  i think the agri tech thing is the final nail in my coffin. i need to do something im actually good at like studying, etc.  today i had prata with advisor at simpang bedok. it was a comfortable nice night, the wind was blowing and i was having a hot cheese prata with curry. i related to him all the things that sivam said.  oh by the way, sivam is some fortune teller fella that came by my house and he told me a few things: (1) ill never get out of singapore (2) ill marry a fat balding man at 30 (he is the only fella who can take care of me) (3) ill get a job where ill be someone's assistant  thats abt it.  i would like to see how far these predictions will come true. this sivam character is supposed to be good. at predictions i mean.  so anyways, i was supposed to go to NUS recently and a little shiver came over me and i backed out of going. i went to the office instead. the idea of having to be honest with barnard and things like that make me really uncomfortable. and god, i sure dont want to bump into murfett. the fella nearly ate my head the last time we met.  apart from that, well... i have to go to work tomorrow and its friday and then ill go to the library. thats my evening. so much for being an exciting girl as issa put it. i asked him how is it that im exciting. he said: you dive, you travel and you are brown. gee thats his idea of exciting. i wonder how many fellas find me exciting. i know that i look exciting but i dont know if i actually am exciting.  im gonna regret being up this late tomorrow morning.  i wonder if being a journalist means that i will get sick of writing in this blog. i mean if writing actually becomes a career, then do i really want to write in my spare time too? thats an interesting thing for me to find out.  so i was thinking abt NUS and those sindhi girls. god they really screwed me at one time. i was really shaken by that whole episode.  i realize that actually i dont take life seriously at all and hence i speak carelessly and behave carelessly and then i get in trouble. but really, i do find a lot of humor in life. i dont take things seriously unless its absolutely necessary. i think its a good way to live life. whats the point of taking everything so goddamned seriously?  you know something abt girls? they are damn prissy abt everything, i cant stand them. i dont want anymore girl pals in my life (with the exception of sharon, she doesnt count as a typical girl if you know what i mean) so im done with the female folk. they have screwed me over once too many times.  i should be sleeping now.

						   alright here i am. its 2.45 pm. there is a great song playing on the radio. and im feeling happy.  i realize something about being a dreamer. im always sort of happy because i see the world through rose colored lenses. im always thinking that everything is going to be alright and i have nothing to worry about. i feel happy most of the time.  i wasnt always this way and i sure wish i was . im making up for it now anyways.  I feel that the world is my oyster. Also i feel very capable and able to achieve anything i put my mind too. i believe in my strengths. I am going to venture out there very soon. I have been looking into some very exciting things which im going to keep mum about for now.  as for romance, well..i dont know. perhaps it might come my way and perhaps it wont.   i have photography class today. its getting to be a drag actually. its not a good thing that i missed some of the classes. im having trouble keeping up with the class properly.  My GRE books are still lying on my desk. i can never seem to get round to them. and i know this isnt a good thing. its hard to study maths.  today is a better day than yesterday.

						   im going to sleep now.  today has not been a good day. that accusations made by that friend left a bad taste in my mouth. i dont know why she had to be so goddam nasty on the phone. even if you have a problem, you can just say it. not turn nasty and over-do matters. i dont think ill ever speak to her again.  also things at work aint all that great. normah made the observation that boss never seems to speak to me much. its true, i think he doesnt like me.  i am miss unpopular indeed.  anyways fairoz was shocked to read that someone could actually find me mean, insulting and snobbish. advisor was taken aback too. so there. i have some true friends out there. its about time that i weed out the false ones.  yes i know that i sound bitter.   i hope tomorrow is a better day.

						   you know what i like to do?..every night, i lie around listening to coldplay's clocks and daylight..and i dream... and its like the music transports me into a whole new realm...a dream like world...  i know that im pretty much a dreamer. i have never been a realist. since i was a little girl. i have not changed much since then. and im a very sensitive and vulnerable person deep inside. its easy for me to feel intense pain or pleasure..  its not a good thing to be a dreamer in the working world. in the academic world, yes. but not the working world. i can get easily screwed being this way in the working world.  i am actually bloody scared of being out there. i dont really want to switch my job or anything like that despite the advisor's constant urging... im the sort of person, when im used to something i dont welcome change.  im happy in my korner. slack jack and relak. (i do work too, please dont get ideas in your head)  so yeah....thats all my ramblings of the day

						   the only thing i lack in my life is romance.  yes, romance.  im talking the stars in your head when the man kisses you, hoping and praying and jumping everytime the phone rings, ..dreaming of how strong his shoulders look, trembling with longing at his deep gaze..things like that.  my love life is virtually non-existent. i want the stars, the roses and passion. i want it all.  its funny how over the years, we get less and less affected by romantic gestures. when i was sixteen and if a boy kissed me, ill be going on and on about it for days, replaying it over and over again in my head. at 25, its like yeah, what else is new... that is not a good thing.  any contenders to light my fire?

						   i was speaking to the advisor over lunch today. he was talking abt my current job state. sort of bummed me out a little ...feeling like a real loser these days.  apart from that all is well. i told him abt issa's proposal. yes guys, some american dude from carleton had a marriage proposal for me. that i marry him for one year. thats the proposal. and yes, he was serious.  advisor was going on about where my self-respect was, if i did take up this offer. thats what i told issa then. and issa was like , damn you arent whoring yourself so whats wrong with it.  thats how life goes. the one fella actually interested in me is actually halfway round the globe. actually i dont know how interested, i mean one year?! that has to be the strangest marriage proposal i have ever received.  anyways, life is becoming very stale. and im beginning to also wonder how many of my so-called friends out there actually silently resent me. this one obviously did and i had no idea. the sindhi girls did and i had no idea. im very clueless when it comes to these things.  so anyway, here i am miss unpopular, trying to keep up with my blog. i must say i have done a fine job of actually writing in here everyday. this means that i can actually keep a boyfriend for real in the future. heh

						   i was just reading some other blog : anthony's emotional outpouring machine. this guy lives in utah. his life sounded good. arrgh.  i should rename this blog :paula's whining sound machine. or trapped in virtual reality or something..  i was thinking carefully abt this : paula, is so snobbish thing. interestingly, this isnt the first time i have received such an accusations. such accusations had been hurled my way before by a bunch of particularly nasty sindhi girls in NUS. today's confrontation reminded me of their statements.... it was traumatic. and i had a whole host of fellas who told me, nahh, you are alright dont worry abt them. gee.  im having a real complex abt my personality right now.

						   well, i have just been accused by a close friend in the past that i am a very 'insulting person'. i must say that took me by surprise. she feels that my having gone to NUS and getting all my academic achievements have turned me into an arrogant snob that looks down on others. i must say i was terribly bewildered at first. the last thing i have ever thought of being is arrogant.. i mean im the last person to show off any achievement of mine...  its just that she has been having trouble getting a job and i have been making the occasional joke, nothing abt her qualifications i might add, like : c,mon, get off your ass already!, things like that which she took very personally. i have also been making jokes like : for an NUS grad, im sure ended up in a strange dead-end sorta place.. i dont think i actually made any mean jokes or anything. but according to her, she sees me as a really mean person and that i should get off my high horse. she really delivered some stinging accusations at me a while ago.   i must admit that i was really taken by surprise. despite explaining and apologizing to her, she maintained her stance that im arrogant and mean and that i look down on others who dont make it in NUS and all my achievements have gone right to my head. i got very angry after a while because it wasnt true. im definitely not arrogant and the last thing i am is proud of any achievement. for god's sake, i left a bloody scholarship ..whats there to say abt achievements?  so im not very happy right now with her because she refused to listen to my apologies.. if she really thinks im like that (she seems real sure abt it), then she really isnt a friend of mine, because my friends would know what i am really like. she was claiming that i am childish, but i seriously feel that she was acting like the immature one in the conversation. i listened to her accusations carefully and i explained to her as best i could that i didnt mean to appear mean or arrogant and that im very sorry if my occasional joke has sparked off anything. i didnt lose my cool at all. she on the other hand, was on some rampage, insisting that i am like that ..  well, everytime i make an attempt at humor, i get these rebuttals and anger...i really should simply stop making any jokes..  i must admit that im feeling highly upset right now. but actually, im not going to bother too much with this particular friend. she has never really been a true friend to begin with despite the fact that we go way back..she has never attempted to be a good friend to me at all, she doesnt call (its usually me that does the calling) ..and she has always seemed so distant.  so im really not going to bother.  i sure dont like being accused of being an arrogant snob. thats the last thing i expected anyone to say of me.

						   nowadays, im sort of feeling the monday blues. i think it is the monotonity of my life. like today, im so subdued and feeling tired and out of it.  i better perk up before the kumar show.  apart from that, my diet plan is not going so well. i tried to take the shake and i felt like vomiting soon after. i threw the rest of it in the sink. i suppose i should blend it with bananas and milk and cocoa or something. there were too many lumps in the shake i prepared today. thats what created the puking factor.  the worst of it is that when i try to go on this diet, i crave the fatty food even more. today i ended up with a mee goreng. last week, i was so traumatised the first day i started that i ate half a plate of carrot cake, a full plate of rice, pork and vegetables and a big cream puff. if i dont deliberately diet, i will consume less fatty food. like grilled stuff and yoghurt. its all a mind thing. so im ending my diet.  two new girls have joined our office today. they are pretty young and are quite nice. they are interns from temasek poly. it sure livens things up over here. i like having new pple around.  my grandmother came for a visit and stayed last night. she is very happy to see me well and enjoying my life. she is a very good grandmother. funny thing is that she cant speak much english but we manage somehow. i was the only grandchild she actually brought up for four years (she shared the bringing up with my dadima). i was a very lucky girl to have been brought up by both grandmothers. my brother winded up with a maid instead. (which is another factor to his rotten personality).  nobody likes jeshi anyway. especially the two grandmothers.   i for one have already disowned jeshi. last month. im not changing my mind on that one.  so im alone in the office now because everyone has left for lunch. i got my hair washed in the salon. its all shiny now. i found a hairdresser in golden landmark next to my office.  i really need to see a trichologist because im losing a lot of hair. it used to be so much thicker.  it would be interesting to see mom enjoying herself at the kumar show. and she has maninder's mom for company so she wont feel awkward.

						   i was just looking through the blog. its true, i put way too much personal stuff in here. also, i seem to be rather whiny.  i went to the film festival. it was interesting. i decided i should produce a film. abt a girl who won a scholarship, left it and returned to spore. my life story. it would be interesting. all the horror of depression. a broken girl that somehow picks up the pieces.  its been a quiet weekend. pretty interesting. i got all introspective again.

						   i am supposed to be in sabah.  my advisor, commonly known as karthik is very worried abt my spending habits and he discouraged my going off again this weekend. sigh.  so im going to the international film festival with maninder. then im going to normanton. and spending the night. watching movies and reading LKY's memoirs (the gift for karthik)  thats abt it. it will be an alright weekend. im just dreading the time when advisor will be running off to london. i can join him there for a week. i will either bringing maninder or sharon with me to keep in company in the week. but they will probably back out on me last minute anyways. sigh.  mom is angry with my wanting to go to london. she thinks im putting my so-called job in jeopardy. oh well.  i need to get my leave sooner or later right. i find that she can get too gabra abt these things. today im not too happy with mother.  after writing all that in the earlier mail, i announced to mother that im definitely moving out. she got upset: "fine, do whatever you want". i was like "mom, i always hated living here, i want to do something else with my life, and i could start with moving out". i think it is a good first step.  she got melodramatic: "i have done my best for you , you devil..do whatever you want" and then she ignored me.  life goes on in tampines street 82..

						   actually my mother is the cause of most of my problems.  its funny, i was sitting next to her a while ago, watching tv when her mother called (my grandma). immediately she launched into some big complaining session abt her life. my mother has been doing this for as long as i can remember. especially when i was young, my mother used to complain to my grandma abt all of my habits and my grandma in turn will tell all her other children. my mom used to paint a really negative picture of my character as a lazy and unfilial sort (this was to play up her victim status). also she used to tell them my really embarassing pre-pubescent problems. i am talking really embarassing here.  god how i used to hate my mom. really, i hated her intensely. somehow i seemed to have forgotten it now. but today when i sat next to her and i heard her launch into this again, god i hated here again. and when i returned from carleton and got really sick with depression, she became the blaring machine, advertising everything in detail to my grandparents and uncles and aunts. and they in turn came by to the house and told me off and how im making my mother sad and all that jazz. and even then, i hated even more. i remember one day when i actually yelled at her to leave me the hell alone and stop interfering and i tried to leave the house (and i had no idea where i was going) and she called everybody up...which of course just made things worse.  she was the victim and i was the pepretrator. even in my darkest moments.

						   lesson 4 of photography class  Film Processing.  you need a changing bag- a mini darkroom thing. it simulates a dark room.  for the film, the lower the ASA the better. it has a better chemical structure and sharpness. 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200  Dont use ASA higher than 100.  Things u need to process film: (1) Changing bag  (2) Processing tent - plastic is better than steel  (3) Measurement cylinders  (4) Three chemical steps  1. Developer 2. Stop Bath 3. Fixer 4. Water  Film developer: use liquid, not powder Agfa is a good brand. developer is very critical.  the more you dilute, the less the contrast.  Temperature: 20 Celsius or 68 FH for normal results  For volume of chemicals, you measure not by length but by height. 1:25 min volume: 300 ml dont go more than 600 ml  2. Stop Bath- stops the developing 1:40  3. Fixer- to fix image properly 1:9 dont use rapid fixer  4. water - 1 hour in running water for washing  general details: - remember to move your canister abt. when developing

						   well today is part one of my birthday celebrations. we are having dinner at arab street tonight: chris, sharon, haydon, daniel, elodie.. i have bought a cake to grace the event (or half a cake?)..and im decked out in a lovely ethnic costume today in gold..  and on monday, it is the kumar show. so far RK, Mayank, Chris and Karthik has agreed to come. I am going to invite Subbu, Maninder and my mother too. apparently kumar has a way of dragging the birthday girl out on stage and embarassing the hell out of her. that would be interesting to see..  apart from that all is well. my father sent me to work on his bike today. i think my father and i are building some form of a connection. this morning my father was telling the maid off and my mother was spurting and heaving..the maid is very spoilt and does a lot of funny things and its because of my mom. of course, my mom would rise in retaliation of my dad. problem with mom is that she lets pple take advantage of her and she is very simplistic. dont get me wrong, i really do love my mother. but she really messes up in people relations. one good example is my brother. he has to be the worst type of character i have ever seen and its all because of mom. though she will rant and rave if we tell her that. and now it is this maid, whom i really cant stand at all.- all because of mom.  thank goodness that mom practised favouritism and ignored me most of the time when i was younger. or punished me so severely every time jeshi made a mistake. at that time, i felt wronged and unloved...and yes that manifested itself in several sort of behaviours in the later part of my life- my esteem issue is one thing and the highly dependent relationships i formed ..i wanted to be mothered and cared for...these issues, i have begun to resolve of late.  but im just glad that she didnt spoil me and that i had to go through the hard life. i used to marvel at children whose parents actually listened to them and gave them what they wanted. my mother would never tolerate our speaking back and delivered a stinging slap if you got spoilt and demanded something. that was good for me.  rajesh on the other hand, had my mom twisted around his chubby finger.  but look what has become of him now... like what my father said, in the end he will suffer. i sure turned out a lot better than him. he used to be the mean , bullying sort...always getting his way..being a real selfish idiot. and life dealt him his cards. and dealt me mine.  i am very happy these days. a lot happier than i used to be. i still marvel at the what i call 'the dark years' of my life. all throughout my JC and my Uni days. I was a very unhappy person and i did all sorts of crazy things. and i formed the worst sort of relationships with boys..totally dependent on them, having no confidence ..stuff like that... i didnt have much of a personality. and i kept hiding in the shadows best i could.  it is only recently that i have come out of my shell and started seeing life as something really great and having immense possibilities. and to think that at one time, i was really very suicidal when it came to life.... it is ironic.  i am glad the dark years are over,. some pple fall deeper. i got myself out of it.

						   i have my second photography class today. actually it is the fourth lesson and i have missed two already. yes i know that is not a good thing.  i have downed down 2 gallons of water and taken four of my pills so far. i need to take 6 pills every day. and drink all the shake i can manage. i hope i dont get sick of the taste.  and i used to be a glutton. sob.  i am planning to buy a digicam. i am also planning to go to london.  lotsa stuff going on. i like life. nope, i love life. i am feeling comfortable and free...  so i still hope to make more friends from the photography class. i will try to ensure im there every week from now on. enough of pekanbaru and padang. and i was supposed to travel on this job. looks like my travelling days are over.  yawn

						   i went to watch 'the passion of christ' again. no im not a sick maniac for gore and blood. my mother hasnt seen it and i know she needs a kaki.   and i fell in love with jesus all over again. oh he is so great...so divine...so handsome and tall and noble..and what beauty lies in his eyes...and the smooth fairness of his skin... jesus, the love of my life and the light of my heart.  so mom brought me to mouth kitchen which dissapointed me in a way. it wasnt what i expected. and today i had kenny rogers which was way more satisfying. im still on a diet . no worries.  i got a mail from prakash which was a pleasant surprise. i hope to see him soon. he was the one who crowned me 'small queen'. he has never met anyone quite so small after me.  kash once said that he could never see me surviving being single. i did after all have a whole string of boyfriends. well i have not had any steady boyfriend for the past year now. so there.  beckham apparently sleeps around behind posh's back. i dont blame him. posh looks like a lizard.  i am sleeping with a smile these days...i have plenty of things cooking up my sleeve which i cant reveal just yet...

						   well. i have slightly got over my initial surprise abt the cancellation of my flights over there. i cant shake off the nagging feeling that i might just get fired anytime. boss is capable of doing that.  well the seminars ran very well. or maybe he felt they could do without me. i dont know.  sheesh.  so the birthday is on then. in singapore and not with boss.  i still dont know what to make of this....

						   ok now i have done my unpacking, gave my laundry to the maid, looked at my estee lauder, checked my mail...and yep, thats pretty much about it... nothing to do.  nothing much comes to mind right now. listening to coldplay. ..i like coldplay. best contemporary group there is.  my birthday is coming up but i wont be in singapore. i found out that i have to leave on wed, and return the following wed. thats how life is.  spending the birthday with my boss...arrgghh..  a friend of mine from carleton just told me abt her sleeping problems and how unhappy she is over there. she told this in the beginning, i thought she was adjusting fine by now,. but it seems that her problems are still persisting.  i dont know how to convey to her not to make the same mistakes i did. not to take life so seriously and not let the stress level there get to her. its so easy to say it now. over there, things were different though. i really hope she doesnt lose it. im very worried. sleeping problems are a very difficult problem to battle. heck , i should know.  its so easy to say, gee if i had clean slate and could start over , i woul do it differently. these are supposed to be the best years of her life. i would hate for her to get depressed like how i was in the university. even in spore, i was majorly out of it for four years.  only recently , i have learnt to be happy. and then i wonder why the hell i was so down all those years. i had virtually no confidence...i took everything so seriously. now i see her doing the same.  i dont really know what to say to her. because i know when i was like that, all the advice i got just flew over my head. she has to find the path on her own. there is very little i can say.

						   well i am feeling a little low.  i am a little worried about my trip to medan tomorrow. if anything goes wrong, its my ass on the line. it is going to be stressful. plus its on a weekend. which means i get no break for the whole week. it will be tiring.  i have to buy some sockets now. gee.  and i have a lot of things to carry. it sure isnt easy whenever this overseas thing comes up. and here i was begging for a job that can take me around.  a cab almost rammed into me today. it shook me up. images of my lying in hospital with broken bones danced before me..  not a good sign.

						   my dad sent me to work in his motorbike today. we had a tea together at the 'bhai' shop near the office. it was interesting to show dad my little world in arab street. he was going on and on about how i really ought to get 'out there'. in a way i understand one line of his notion- that i need to be 'exposed'. i really have been working on that. the best way i know how.  i do want to get out there too.  so it was a very interesting morning.

						   and mr 'man' is not revealing himself. hmm.  i have no idea who he might be.   i hope he isnt gonna do the whole 'mystery man' bit with me. i had plenty of that especially in uni. a boy calling me up and being 'mystery man'.  i am hoping he might be a secret admirer though. that could make my life interesting.

						   ok im officially over rajpal.  firstly, haydon called me last night and he was speaking about how 'hung up' i am over the guy. and i thought about it a bit this morning.  then, i had lunch with sukhdev (my new pal) at zam zam, and he asked me if i dated in uni. and i spent a long time speaking about rajpal. and he pointed out quite accurately that we were unsuitable for each other. there was something he said that struck me quite profoundly: i would have never been happy with rajpal, because he wouldnt have made me happy at all. we dont have the same vision about life. i have a totally different notion (as screwed up as it may be) about how i want to live my life. it usually clashed with his opinions.  also what i didnt like about rajpal was that he constantly ridiculed my little ideas about things. he would have definitely ridiculed this blog. he would have ridiculed the slimming sessions. he would have ridiculed the carleton thing. he would have ridiculed my adventure holidays. he found me ridiculous.  so that is that. i feel like a great big boulder has been lifted off my chest. i am happy as hell that i did not end up with rajpal. god, i would probably be married by now if that is the case. and having little turbanators. nahh im fine this way.  earlier i was just idealising this whole thing in my head like a great big tragic love story. but there is nothing tragic about it. its just 2 pple who didnt click. and thank god, i left it instead of pursuing someone so unsuitable for me.

						   ok i did my 'hobknobbing' thing with sukhdev over breakfast this morning. it went well- apparently he has lived in new zealand for about five years and california for another five years. and he has really been around as well. im impressed. and a little envious. i hope to be able to get around the world like that too. however, sukhdev has as a result, never really been able to hold a relationship or stabilize his life around one goal. he isnt complaining but he does point it out.  what i found very interesting is that sukhdev rates this place to be among the top places to live. In the sense that one can be very comfortable and happy here. The other day, when we spoke to some big client, he called singapore a 'premium place' and that a lot of pple would pay a lot of money to settle out here- you have safety, security, top of the notch facilities.   the thing is that i have been very influenced by my father- he has always been unhappy here and sees 'overseas' as a place of greener pastures. i was brought up with his open condemnation and misery of his fate. i was conditioned to believe for a long time that singapore was not a good place for anyone to live as it lacked a quality that places like australia and canada had.  i am beginning to see things differently though...  well ill talk more abt this later. manish beckons.

						   today is going to be a busy day.  i am amazed at myself. its been two days with very little sleep and im somehow functioning. i spent a long time on the phone to haydon. talking about grad school and other matters. as usual, my conversations with haydon set me thinking of many things.  i am glad to have him as a friend though- one who puts forward an honest perspective on the way my life is heading. i need something like that.  i thought about grad school very carefully. yes i do want to go to hawaii. and i should work hard and get there. right now, i dont think im doing anything 'real'..in the sense that i dont find myself truly caught up in my work the way i was with academic matters.  i also realized that because i didnt go through the so-called traditional path to academia, i have a bit of an esteem problem. something i just have to work through. i see the way sharon is struggling with trying to achieve her dreams and it puts me to shame. my path to academia is much easier to tread. and yet i hold back, while she fights for what she wants....

						   you know what. it is baiskahi today. and i didnt even know. shame on me.  so as usual i havent gone to the temple. i didnt take the day off though i was entitled to. i did nothing. i was told about it only later.   see didnt i say that the bhangra dancing moves is the only punjabi thing about me? with addition to my punjabi nose. thats abt it.  also in fairoz's blog, he goes on and on about why he took up history to sort of write about the muslim theology affairs and all that- and i think im the only sikh that did not write about khalsa. i was just telling him that i should write abt the guru granth sahib or something.  maybe my going to india will change all this and i will get more in tune with my culture.

						   well the work has been progressing well today.   i wanted to catch 'saturday night fever' but that musical is done and finished with. I do feel sorta sad about that because not many of the musicals over the the esplanade otherwise known as durian head, get me that excited (apart from 'singing in the rain').  boss seems fine with me, and he has handed me this massive project to do. i am trying my best not to piss him off ( i seem to do superbly well when it comes to pissing people off, no kidding). he actually chuckled once or twice. it is also good that i can hobknob with that sukhdev pal of his. i was thinking that i might invite sukhdev out for lunch tomorrow just to get to know him better. he is a pretty funny sort of guy.. a highly entertaining bhai...  it sort of occured to me that im not really hanging with any of 'my people'. actually i dont have a single proper bhai friend these days. i do miss my bhangra. i can do a mean jig on the dancefloors. thats what i enjoyed doing with rajpal the most- the bhangra dancing that went on for hours on a saturday night. he was a pretty good dancer. and he always marvelled at my dancing. i think thats the only punjabi thing he found in me.  i was talking to karthik, otherwise known as my official adviser. he pointed out that i have a way of flitting ..meaning im not settling on one ambition and that i am highly distracted most of the time. he is not wwrong actually. i have to change that.  ok more work to be done. later.

						   I was just reading sharon's blog. seems like she is actually willing to be godmother to my children. that in itself is quite a compliment. i would be more than happy to have her as godmother,- and it would be highly interesting to watch as well (because sharon isnt your regular kind of gal).   all i need to do now is land me a yale man (haydon are you listening?)  well today i actually have a lot of work to do. a lot. and the best thing is that the work is not dull this time. its some profile writing for our new company. and also i have some agricultural technology studies to do which is gonna be pretty ok too.  my only fear abt marrying a boy from india is that im gonna end up with computer savvy kids that do not have a taste for the fine arts. i can just imagine it already. and about my teaching in bangalore, i have been thinking about it day after day. the idea is getting more and more feasible. i might just go for it after the end of this year.  alright there is a lot of work to do.

						   i just checked out my BMI (body mass index)- its 18 and apparently i fall dangerously close to the underweight category. well thats because i entered my information through a computer and they cant see the tyre  i have around my middle. and my thighs and hips that are growing wider as we speak. my slimming sessions thingy is justified. its just a matter of going now. i have already paid my 350 bucks (usual price 1800 bucks).  i will be flying off to medan this coming friday. at least it is something different. but it also means im working around the clock the whole week. boss doesnt believe in giving days off even though you worked all weekend. i will be bushed by the end of 2 weeks cos i will be flying to padang the week after.  yes i did regret my night of careless abandon when i woke up this morning. i could barely get out of bed and my eyes were practically sewn shut.  its gonna be a shitty day because i feel so out of it right now.

						   right now im a little drunk. no kidding.   i went to ravi's place and we made masala lamb and had plenty of wine. my pals ajit and papu from malaysia were supposed to give me a call but i think they were stuck in the jam or something. i watched 'america's top model' at ravi's place. im rooting for that skinny thing called elise .. i think that girl has style. the blond isnt bad but she has the whole cheerleader thing. elise on the other hand has sophiscation.  i was thinking that i should pin up posters of all the fellas i have had a crush on in some order: these include bruce lee, hrithik roshan and jesus.. that would be kinda cool. just some crazy idea that struck me.   now as you can see..i am quite drunk. i was practically staggering out of ravi's place. i am not feeling too great...im slightly nauseous right now actually.  its very late right now. i will regret this in the morning.

						   all right, i had all these things to say abt the mount ophir trip and my 'introspective' moments. but today has been a very busy day. and these memories are slowly fading.  so let me say this: i had a fabulous weekend. it was great. i enjoyed myself immensely. the water was beautiful and the air was fresh. we camped out, ate maggi mee cooked on a campfire, slept in a tent, boiled our water..swam in the waterfall... i had a book with me which i kept reading all day..it was an excellent way to enjoy a book. sitting on a boulder with the water swarming across my feet...with nothing but a bikini on...a really excellent trip...  and yes, like my earlier trip at tioman, i went through a great deal of introspection. about where my life is heading and stuff..my mind feels so free and cleansed right now. i feel at peace with myself. and i have a gorgeous tan.  it was tough to climb the mountain though. i only did 1/10th of it and it damn near killed me too. so much for being miss thrill seeker. but one thing that i am really proud of is that i jumped into the freezing water at 8 in the morning without so much as a backward glance while karthik trembled on the ledge for hours before sliding in inch by inch into the cold water. yes it was bloody freezing and i was loving every minute of it.  i did some shopping at the johor megamall later. i bought 'boy' by roald dahl. roald dahl is like my most favourite writer in the world. i will never get sick of his stuff. i plan to raise my kids with a healthy dose of roald dahl. his world is simply magical...  i came to work at 9 am on the dot today. i was very proud of myself. and i worked hard. today we met with someone who runs a wonderful little school for children. it got me thinking of more possibilities that life can take me... i could be a wonderful drama teacher i think..  me, boss and sukhdev (boss's friend) had a grand old time driving down to mountbatten and back. it was pretty funny cos sukhdev was going on and on about all the pubs he has gone to. man, this fella at 44 was a lot more happening than me. he is partying at zouk in kl last week apparently. and i didnt even know it existed. it made feel sort of amused.  well i actually have some actual real write-ups to do. so till then.... (i just hate to stop my writing and get down to real work..sigh)

						   so i just came back from one of the most awesome holidays i have had for a long time. it was just amazing.  i am very tired now but i have so much to share and also, i have cooked up some major plans in my head during my introspective moments in mount ophir. tomorrow will be a good day to start.   yawn. nite.

						   well so much for my big mountaineering holiday. i am still stuck out here in singapore and its gonna be 3 pm soon.  firstly i overslept. secondly we decided to head out to a waterfall instead. now karthik has gone to get the south-east asia travel book. it will have a guide of waterfalls.  i spoke to my grandfather today. he is very happy abt hawaii. i have to admit that surprised me. i didnt think he would be approving of the whole thing.  so much for hawaii, i havent been working on the GRE Book. i really need to buck up. if i am really serious abt the united states of whatever, i really need to get going on these. and worst of it is that i had the time to go through the GRE Book. Just that when i hit the maths section, i went down. i stopped looking at it.  oh and about my photography class, i decided to get to transmitting the class in articulate detail so that i spread 'the pearls of wisdom' about. i know that mayank for one will be happy to see it. it lets him sift through the inane stuff to get to things that really matter.  this holiday is on a bad start. i have a sense of foreboding about the whole thing.   i am really enjoying writing in this blog. contrary to popular belief, i dont think that im gonna get bored of writing in this. i want to write in here until im 67 or so. lets see how it goes.  i think photography will really give me a whole new perspective on life. it should enhance the aesthetic pleasure of life. it is a celebration of the gift of sight.  oh and so much for friends, the photography class does have a myriad of characters, young and old..but they dont look like 'friends' material really...there is about ten of us in the class. it was all sort of awkward when the teacher wasnt in the class.  but i like the substation as a whole. i really want to join their acting class. and i saw some pretty interesting, brooding looking characters hanging about.  it has that whole artsy fartsy character and feel to it.  i am gonna be the life of the substation. just you wait and see...

						     Lesson Two of Photography Class.  Lenses and their effects.  What defines a lens is its focal length.  The ones of different sizes have different focal lengths.  'The standard lens': The image captured is what your eyes see. Nothing zoomed in or enlarged, etc. The usual focal length for this is 50 mm.  What is interesting to note here is that the lecturer said that the most well known of photographers liked this particular focal length and wouldnt change it to any other. to capture the image like it is.  He also said this: Every picture is a decisive moment. I thought it was deep.  A shorter focal length gives you a wider angle. They come in the following ranges: 28, 24, 21, 20, 19, 17, 16, 15, 14, 12, 11, 8, 6 The shorter your focal length, the wider your image. However, the wider your image, the greater the distortion. (meaning corners are not sharp, they looked twisted and pulled). also, objects become overlarge in the middle. Advantages: the wider your image, the greater the sharpness of depth.   special wide angles: 16, 8, 6 They are called fish eye lens. It is believed that the vision of fish is wide and the things they see are twisted.  Longer focal length: Telephoto lens This comes from the word telescope. (same effect) They come in the following ranges: 70, 80, 90, 100, 105, 135, 150, 180, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 2000 Disadvantage: the image gets shaken easily. And when you focus, the background around the object gets blurred. Advantage: you can stand a distance away to grab photos. (wildlife shots, sports pics)  70 - 200: Portrait lens Keep a comfortable distance btw subjects and you. Focus on the person and remove the background. dont let the b/g be as equally sharp as the person focused upon.  Zoom lens are a big no no. period. It has no real quality. It takes up too much lighting, colour and contrasts. What you should aim for is impact and sharpness which the zoom lens cannot give you.  With a fixed lens, you get the quality. the only thing abt zoom lens is that it is convenient.  For a good compact camera, buy the 35mm wide angled lens. and when not using, remove the battery.  What kind of lens to buy:  1. Plastic - it is very light but it gets blurred and scratches easily - also it is easily damaged in heat. - its only convenience is that it is light.  2. crystal optics - problem is that its density is not very even. - and it needs a lot of polishing. - but it does give a beautiful, full toned picture. the plastic does not give sharp pictures like the crystal optics. (recommended :kaosai) buy russian made lenses.  What to look for when buying your lens? The F-stop.  It controls the amt of light coming through. Ranges: 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32 the smaller the no., the more light comes in the larger the no., the less light comes in.  the larger the no, the higher the depth of sharpness. For a sharp scenery shot, 32 is best. even to capture the three-dimensional diamond, go for 32. The larger numbers provide photos that are full of texture.

						   so it has been a somewhat quiet day. i find myself getting addicted to the internet. im surprised how hard it is to tear myself away from it these days.  sharon called me 'Lady Grace' on her diary thing. it brought me a laugh. we had both decided to christen me Paula Grace at one time, and she wrote the most beautiful poem for my birthday with that name as its central focus. it was entitled 'ode to a faery'.

						   life is full of possibilities.  ok before we come to that, i gave karthik his birthday present: SM Lee's Memoirs. He was thrilled to bits. see didnt i tell you, that i would get this guy something he loved totally? he has been a big fan of lee for some time and i know he wanted that book to adorn his shelf.  ok life is full of possibilities. firstly, my mom gave me this idea. to take up some sort of education/early childhood studies course in australia. she thinks it would be useful to have something like that with me if i ever needed a job or something. then karthik gave me an idea : to teach at a college in bangalore. i could teach literature, history, english. i thought it was fantastic: firstly i can pursue my research interests in the universities over there (colonialism), secondly i get exposed to a brand new lifestyle and culture which is important for my development. i mean its india man...it doesnt get any better in terms of my exposure.  and i am at the most wonderful stage in my life right now i am not committed to anything. i am free to just take off as and when.   i am happy.

						   it seems almost criminal that pple like sharon and fairoz did not get the upper. they are obviously intelligent and they demonstrate a real passion for the work too.  i used to think that fairoz's presentations were one of the best and most creative i have ever seen. if he ever became a professor, i would definitely send my children to him. if that doesnt happen, i will send my children to him for jawi lessons and other little philosophies.  sharon writes beautifully. she is a lot more perceptive than i am. and she lives and breathes philosophy. she has talent. i was amazed by her blog when i read it. a truly impressive piece.  and i ended up with the gold awards. life can indeed be unfair.

						   i was going through other people's blogs as usual. it can be a tiring affair to trawl through an array of fonts, writing styles, pictures...i dont understand why so many of them use a black background with white words. i find that very hard to read. i am glad that my blog is so simple and plain. and i still find my blog more entertaining than most of the blogs out there. so there.  dear god, please forgive me and let me confess that my GRE books have been lying in the corner all day while i surf the net. it is really painful to get down to GRE work. i know i have to take it seriously. according to haydon, this is HIGHLY important. but i cant seem to interest myself in their maths section. i left maths behind me a long time ago. it seems almost cruel to make me take that up again.  when i was younger, i used to check out these fortune books based on your lucky number and signs and all that. it all said one thing that came to my mind today: you love luxury. and funnily enough, though i was confused by it at that time, i find it holding good now. i have been spending a lot of my money on luxury items- latest thing that im 'thinking' of purchasing (please note the 'thinking' here) is estee lauder make-up products which are grossly expensive. i know, i know..its terrible..i am supposed to quit this lifestyle already.  and what good with estee lauder do me in college anyways? when i get there. where no one even wears lipstick, let alone eyeliner and mascara and blush. i was amazed when i entered carleton that none of the girls wore make-up. wearing make-up has been such an integral part of my life that i continued to put make-up on over there. needless to say, i did attract a fair share of boys.  so its past work and i am allowed to leave this joint. i am wondering what i should be doing right now. hmm, i suppose i should be out shopping. god im so banal these days. i have nothing to say. its just musings of a foodaholic, shopaholic and and one who is always being hung up on bloody carleton.  i am still drinking my gallon of water and fresh juice every morning which seems ironic considering that my smoking habit is increasing. i have to quit the smoking habit. then the world will make sense again. i think the gaia yoga place can help me with that.  i started smoking due to depression. i am now smoking out of habit.  but there is something about smoking..i like listening to music and getting high on nicotine..it has a good feel to it.  ok i am very tired today. it can be tiring to do nothing all day long.

						   i am feeling completely bored.  i listened to the entire coldplay album at work. twice. im done with it.  i was thinking how i keep saying '20 years from now'..blah blah...again it goes back to the fact that i am a history student. this blog holds much fascination for me because of its a sort of chronicling of day-to-day activities. the keyword here is 'chronicling'.  i have no idea what to do today. another evening stretches wide open in front of me. i want to buy one more cd. and look for karthik's present.  boss is in a dilemma. he needs to send a teacher to teach english over at indonesia, pekanbaru to be exact. the teacher will earn 4000 bucks. i have hinted to him on a number of occasions that he is very welcome to send me. i wont mind going. the only thing that is daunting is that i would have to teach there for 5 mths. sure i can take flights back to spore every weekend. but i sure can get lonely. i dont mind it though. i think it will be ok. i might make some friends (hopefully). but im not sure if boss is going to send me over to PKU. he might if he didnt have a choice. maybe he should send me for a mth or two till he finds a replacement. he is in trouble now for not sending someone over.  but i dont think he will send me. he needs me around in the firm. sigh. and also i have signed up for all these great courses. i cant just leave all of them halfway. and everyone in singapore will weep to see the small queen depart.  jeez.

						   i went shopping at bugis junction just now. i was supposed to look for a birthday gift for karthik. i found out about the various scents of hugo boss, looked at ten ties and cuffs and pins, looked at the metal and bronze namecard holders..it went on and on. i couldnt see him being happy with any of these sorts of gifts.. i am going to spend time thinking of something thoughtful to give him.  i did buy a nice gift for me though- 'parachutes' by coldplay. i love coldplay. they are about the best contemporary group i have heard so far. second to the beatles.   its easy to get gifts for a girl i think- for me its pretty simple, ..perfume, chocolates, cookbooks, diamonds..girlie stuff..but when it comes to guys, sigh...especially someone as basic as karthik or should i use the word minimalist...   oh well. i am supposed to know him like the back of my hand. i will find something that is so totally him and he will love it.  we are going mountaineering at mt ophir on friday. mohsen, chris and their females might join in. it will be good fun. i am so looking forward to that. i will take pictures and somehow get them on this website.

						   I am very much a creature of temptation. When I know something is wrong, i still have to try it anyway. I dont know why, I just have to. Even when I know full well about its drastic consequences, I will still go for it. I have bad habits that many know of and I am not going into great detail about it here. those are skeletons in my closet.  And that is that.  I went out with ratish yesterday. yes folks, the 'other one' who could have seduced me away from rajpal. that was quite a saga back in uni when both boys was interested and i had to choose one. those days, i was at least a little 'hot'. now, i am sitting around on saturday nights and writing in my blog. Come to think of it, I did attract a fair number of boys in my prime. It wasnt so bad, I had a good time.  as i was telling haydon earlier, he has a beard that i find most unbecoming. he has changed a great deal and that unnerved me a little. i was thinking to myself when i returned that i had chosen ratish over rajpal back in those days, life would have led me down a different path. its interesting when you think about things this way. maybe i wouldnt have even ended up here and writing in this blog. life works in mysterious ways.  Both me and Ratish agree that I made the right decision with rajpal. all is well.   life goes on as usual in arab street.

						   i went into fairoz's website and it gave me a shock. this fella actually went into great detail about some alcohol component found in his davidoff cologne. great detail about its haram vs non haram factors. already i told him, no need to dosa, just pass the stuff to me. but it seems that he is bent on going to the root of the issue with the AD thing.  only leads me to realize that compared to fairoz's blog, mine is getting more banal by the day. I dont really have any issues to talk about.  all right, ill just go into whats been occupying my mind of late: Photography. My new hobby. I will be going for the first class tomorrow evening. There is no one i could find to come along with me. So i hope to make some good friends there.  Let me share the lesson plan 1. history and evolution of the camera- which i missed. (it was last week) . i just have to read that up on my own by today.  2. Uses of different lenses and effects- that is tomorrow's lesson.   I will stop here and just let you all know tomorrow how it went. it worries me that i havent done this with a good start. i mean, i missed the first lesson which started 1st april. i hope that doesnt put me at a disadvantage.  i really hope to make some cool friends from photography class.

						   you know what just hit me?..pple have really messed up big time, a lot more than i have. i knew one indian muslim girl who was very bright. she forgot to the time of an exam and turned up in the afternoon. she got an 'f' . and despite the fact she had straight 'A's for everything else, she couldnt get into honours.  thats a big mess up.  i would have died if i messed up like that.  so the carleton thing is ok. it wasnt a degree programme. and also, i still have my gold awards and stuff. its not gonna ruin the rest of my life. i will be ok.  it was a good wake up call.

						   it is now 4.41 p.m.  i feel like having some tea.  i am thinking of going for holistic living. fruits and yoga. the good life.  i have been looking at the yale website since haydon is going there. it is really beautiful. if i had the chance to go to yale, man...i would be horribly overjoyed. i hope that he really makes the full use of his time there and really soak in the liberal arts atmosphere. its hard to explain, like i was over there in carleton and didnt realize how great it was till i got back. its easy to take it for granted while you are there. if you are out there haydon, do one thing. burn the memory of NUS in your mind. BURN it. and then go there and see the remarkable difference. now that place has an academic atmosphere. ... gosh its really beautiful. once i get my pics up with blogspot gold plus or whatever, i will put in images of carleton and yale and you pple can see what i am talking about.  so back to holistic living. there is a yoga center called gaia .. it looks nice. i can study the asananas (breathing techniques) and get into the other stuff too...it would be great. just great. learn to be at peace with myself.  mayank was the second one to complain apart from issa that this blog moves way too fast. yep its not for the faint hearted. one needs great stamina to keep up with this blog. the small queen chronicles notes two dropouts so far.

						   i was thinking about today's date very carefully. 6th of april, tuesday, 2004. it is a significant date. one day, 30 years down the road, i am going to think of 6th of april 2004. and how life seemed to lay such possibilities ahead of me..thats the feeling i have right now...like there is so much of life...glorious glorious life....and i just dont want to waste a second..i want to do everything..feel everything...experience everything...sadness, laughter, happiness, joy, rage, contentment...i want it all..  i feel so free....lightweight ....  im going to substation with chris later to apply for the photography course. and maybe some salsa too. and there is the adobe photoshop. with adobe im facing my fear of computers. with photography, im celebrating my love for life. with salsa..im moving to the rhythm of life..  the visitor has blissfully left..life starts again.  boss is happy with my taking photography. it will be good for the company. i am glad i joined this company. i am finally learning about the world out there. and im spreading my wings and flying.

						   a peek into paula's world. muses galore. into the mind of a depressive, suicidal maniac. a life like no other.  just some of the titles that came up before 'the small queen's chronicles'. i am sticking with 'small queen'. another paula trademark.  fairoz was telling me like :"yeah, you are addicted to your blog now, that addiction will fade and all that. arrghh. i dont want it to fade. because i want to still be writing in this when im 40. this is my legacy to my children and my grandchildren. i will be the next anne frank. spore might get invaded by iraq...or we could become the next lost city of atlantis..and out there in the web, it will be discovered, the musings of a 24 year old going on to 25.  22nd april is judgement day aka my birthday. this upcoming birthday depresses me. i feel old at 25. i feel the weight of new responsibilities. i liked being 24, 23 and 22. i do not like being 25. its a marker. im officially a quarter of a century old. sob.  im sitting at work in my little desk..my small space....books and papers strewn everywhere. i can hear manish cooing on the phone as usual. jim is constantly surfing the web...the new girl is staying quiet in her corner. i like this attic. and by the way, i am the life of this attic.  i really do like working here. i hope boss doesnt fire me too soon.  i was having my usual morning breakfast with mom. she wakes me up every morning. that is sort of sweet that she would wake up early to wake me up. i have no qualms about going to sleep without an alarm for the most trusty one i can have is my mother. she cannot tolerate my being late and is a stickler for punctuality.  so much for an exciting dating life, it is practically non-existent. so much for being the most eligible punjabi girl around. i just live on little crushes and old hang-ups. its sad.  i dont really know what i want anyway. thats me,. .. never knowing what i want. i want this and that and yet i dont want it....i can drive anyone crazy. i like to reel it in and spit it out and ponder ponder. i get highly excited easily and then a low can hit me over like a wave....jumping around one moment..becoming morose the next....screaming and staying silent....i have a myriad of mood swings that ex boyfriends are only too aware of...

						   ok the earlier post was a heavy one. i feel the need to lighten up the mood a little now.  so i went shopping with jim, my colleague. it was awlrite...just walking abt..ate really bad halal wantan mee..thats abt it.  thats the thing when i meet muslims- i always wind up eating really bad food...first it has to be halal, ..then in order that i dont feel like i HAVE to meet malay food, we end up in a malay joint that cooks up kway teow and wantan mee and things like that. and such food usually sucks.  you cannot eat chinese food made by a malay. it needs to be made by a chinese. a chinese dish has subtle flavours. it gets ruined by a malay's need to overspice.  i am feeling pleasantly tired again. i want to be able to sleep soundly and dreamlessly tonight. i will report tomorrow morning if that was possible.  god im so hungry. i would give anything for hot french fries with ketchup. ..or hot buttery toast with tomato soup... or mashed potato with butter and salt...hmm...or perhaps maggi noodles fried with onion and french beans... mmm....or perhaps bread toasted with fresh garlic....or a creamy pasta with chicken....or...fish curry with hot bread....or a cheese toast with bbq sauce and mushrooms....  ill dream of food tonight perhaps

						   ok i was looking at other people's blog and i realized something. it may look all fancy with pics and designs and stuff but most of these pple are boring writers. either that, or they write magnificently but its way too verbose and this makes it difficult to digest.  they lack my charm and humour.  so my blog is not so bad after all.  i should stop this comparing with others thing. rebekah had identified it as a problem over at carleton. she called it an 'over-achiever attitude'. and always wanting to be no.1 ..we call it kiasu over here yankee... but yeah i was obsessed with doing well because i was the only damn postgrad walking around. that can weigh heavily on a person. not an easy title to carry at an undergrad college.  so i think im gonna end up going to ophir after all. it is something different from the usual thing with the islands. i am still sunburnt. my mom is pissed.   i was hanging with mom yesterday and i was thinking of all the little philosophies she lives by and has imparted to me over the years. Never tell a lie, never be late , always do your best, take pride in your work, obey the rules, keep to the safe side of life, dont take risks, be loyal to everything you do. I have followed this little principles all throughout my life. only lately, i have been questioning it.  my mom has never dared to try anything. she has hardly seen anything. she stays within the confines of her role and she does her best. i must admit that she is a very good mother. she took on the responsibility of raising us very well. she always ensured that we had the books we needed, that our shoes were clean and that we handed in our homework. it was a lot for her, to be handling an entire house, cook and clean , have a job and to raise two kids. and to have a basically absent husband who didnt help her with anything. my mother is very brave in some ways. she married the wrong man but she didnt take the easy way out and leave him. instead, she endured and did the best she could with her situation.  say if i married the wrong man, i would get into a major depression. I dont think i would have the energy to doggedly try to keep a good home and raise my kids and pay the bills and so on. I would probably be quite morose. Not my mother. Though she was highly sickly and kept ending up in the hospital and had a terrible athritis to deal with which brought her so much pain, she could hardly move at times, she kept trying. she was very honest and sincere with her dealings and she really tried her best with whatever life had handed to her. i do admire my mother and i wish that i had half the strength that she did to face life and its situations.   but in some ways i feel that i have strengths that my mother does not possess. i am not timid in trying new things. i do dare to confront those who have hurt me. i have a passion for life and for living in some ways that i want to experience all there is. not my mother. she likes to live within the narrow confines of her life. she likes the familiar. she is terrified of change. her life is built around trying to achieve stability. she believes in the tried and the trusted.  sometimes it is so unfair, how life has short changed my mother. to end up with such a husband who has done nothing but bully her from the very day she married him. and yet she stuck by him so loyally. and to have such a mentally unstable son. one who keeps bringing her nightmares. some of the stunts he has pulled, especially with his life has really given her some major shocks. and i feel that he is pretty ungrateful too ..he doesnt care very much for her at all. and then she has me, the almost absent daughter..the one who is always trying to disassociate herself from her family and home, living like a recluse in her room ..i am trying to do more for her, to hang out with her and buy her little gifts and stuff.   but i do realize that she has always put rajesh before me and still does till today. when we were young, she was always concerned abt him. she begged me to look after him and i did my very best. whenever something happened to the boy, she would go into a panic. any achievement i have made, whatever i have done didnt really matter to her. it was always about how rajesh was. and he was always getting himself into trouble and worrying her to bits.  i admit it has upset me. especially when i was younger.  until today, it is still the same. its all about rajesh. she takes it as a mission of hers to look after him forever. she tells me this often: "rajesh is my son, and he is very sick and i will look after him to the best of my ability, it may mean i have to take care of him forever and i will do it". what she doesnt see is that this is not doing anything good for my brother. he is obviously very spoiled and also out of touch with reality. yes i admit rajesh is very sick and that he has done some things that has shocked the hell outta me too. but that doesnt mean we should baby him. he is already 20 for god's sake. i wish he wasnt such aweak character.  anyway before i veered off...i feel life has shortchanged her. it doesnt seem fair that someone with such a golden heart should be dealt with such cards. she is a much better woman than me. and i have so much more than she ever had at my age.  and here i go whining and whining over the little things. if barnard was around he would say :'"ooh poor baby..im so smart, i got a scholarship, i left it..whiny whiny...oh poor me working for an architectural firm where i get paid and get to travel...sob sob... and ooh how i have to work now to put things right with the carleton issue..whiny whiny...look at what its done to my mental state and oh how i regret not being able to hang out there and enjoy spring..sob sob...." yes that is exactly what barnard would say.  alright so i left the damn place. it was my own stupid mistake. i just quit feeling sorry for myself.  when i was so depressed in december, my mom looked me in the eye and said this with so much sadness that it touched me "at least this is a small mistake and you will be ok, look at me, look at the mistake i made when i was your age, i married the wrong man..and i have the rest of my life to pay for that mistake"..and that is true.  so im going to keep the image of my mother's strength in mind and i will work hard and get myself out of this situation.

						   so that small owl-faced creature commonly known as karthik has returned. he seems happy to be back and talking to me. as for me, i was just grumpy on the phone that he went off for such a long bloody time. it was a tough week..i did feel sort of bored and lonely without him around to kid with. anyways the creature tells me that he has to go to britain for 2 mths sometime soon. its time for me to find a brand new confidante. and one who does not travel so much.  to other things.  its a quiet day. i havent taken a fag all day. im trying to quit the habit alright, so get off my back, the whole load of you... i have to admit that i have gotten highly addicted. all started the day manish told me that boss hasnt been too pleased. i went to get myself a pack. havent stopped smoking since. but no worries. the habit will disappear as easily as it came..  haydon and i are exchanging little notes on email. its kinda cute. i became brave and revealed to him the real professor i had a crush on in school. (instead of who i profess it to be). he hasnt taken issue with that at all. suprisingly. or maybe that he wasnt surprised by it. i dont think anyone would be surprised as it was everyone's guess anyway.  so well...im gonna cut this short.  supposed to be doing a lot of work.

						   ok, there is a new girl in our office. different from the previous girl. i think she is taking over zai's position. she is quite nice. and she doesnt look as traditional as the earlier girl. we had lunch earlier.  many pple may not know this, but i am highly uncomfortable around women. i am not kidding. i am very comfortable with guys, i can laugh and joke with them. not with girls. i get tense... dont worry i am not lesbian. i have thought about it carefully, whether im lesbian or not. but no way i am lesbian. i am sure of it.  so i was a little uncomfortable to be all alone with the new girl today but i think i managed somewhat.  there goes my status as the only female in an all male firm.  issa was just telling me that he stop keeping with the blog because it moves too fast for him. true enough, i tend to write in here very often at all periods of the day. i actually wrote this for me, so i dont really care if he can keep with it or not. i doubt many pple are looking at this which leads me to pour out a lot of personal stuff in here...it does disturb some characters that some entries are so personal...to me, its no big deal. the pple who get on this are my closest friends anyways and there is really nothing to hide from them...  well ill get going now. later.

						   so much for a peaceful slumber..i was wracked all night with dreams of having to establish some contract for work..something mind boggling and heavy. i never seem to have a good night's rest.  my cd player conked out on me this morning. i was just thinking earlier that i shouldnt compromise when it comes to music and buy the best damn player around. i will make this purchase later in the evening. i bought that cd player from mustafa for 49 bucks. and it has brought me nothing but trouble. jeez.  i am going to watch passion of christ again because im entranced by jesus. i just want to check it out one more time. actually i was also thinking of getting ben hur too. its supposed to have something to do with christ. and right now i just want to check out all the movies there is that has to do with jesus. my dream man.  so now im at work.  but it is a good week because friday is a holiday.   i decided to be more serious this week. it all has to do with the monday thing where i always make a resolution. funny that when i was in honours, monday did not differ from the rest of the week. in working life, monday stands out very strongly.  later folks..

						   i just got back from seeing 'untold scandal' with my mom.  as usual, the movie left me feeling somewhat calm and quiet. i liked the movie because it potrayed the many varied facets of human character. i especially liked the chaste woman who finally got seduced by the playboy. the part was played very well.   the movie was basically about sexual pleasure ..about human weakness .. about love and about lust. it just felt strange to watch it with mom. kinda embarassing actually because there was a lot of heavy sexual scenes.  another sunday has passed. and work begins tomorrow. back to the mill.  the only thing i dread is the travelling to work tomorrow morning. thats what i hate most-travelling to work in the bloody mrt. i am going to get the basic theory book and work on my driving. even fairoz is learning driving. that puts me to shame.  i am feeling pleasantly tired now.   going to have a nice wonderful rest. i pray that i do not have any vivid dreams. i would like to have just one night of peaceful slumber.  till then...

						   ok now im really jealous of other pple's blogs. with photos and designs and everything. my blog is just a plain old every day account of life. nothing interesting there. i want the pics and all that. jeez.  so its sunday and im still sitting on my ass. so much for doing something. i keep listening to U2's 'Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me' . I played the song five times this morning. i think its an amazing song. promotes a vision of love and passion that is hard to find in ordinary plain old singapore.  it would be nice to have a boy go completely out of his mind for me- like the way these songs promote it. i have gone completely out of my mind for certain fellas. but that was a long time ago. im pretty staid these days. is this called maturity or losing a thirst for life?  i am losing a lot of hair. i am going to the best trichologists to get that problem rectified. next week.  i keep doing this sick thing. i keep going into the carleton website. i live through that website. i get updated on their concerts, stuff going on....it fulfills my pathetic need to be involved with that college in some way. its just so sad..i know.. i still feel like i belong there. maybe when i go to hawaii, this thing will be erased forever. i hope and pray that it does.  i have finally decided on the fragrance im going to start wearing. its going to be the paula trademark: pleasures by estee lauder. and opium by yvesaintlaurent for the nights which is oh so musky.. pleasures has a fresh yet subtle , underlying depth to its scent..its supposed to be what im like in the day...light, fresh ..and yet a hint of something else..something sexy... and opium is thick, rich and musky....mysterious...thats the paula of the nights...that coupled with black eyeliner might just send the fellas panting.  lets see.  the mt ophir looks good but mount kinabalu looks better.  gonna look into it.

						   alright. so i got myself a tag board. all under the advice of fairoz, my malay world kaki.  life isnt so pathetic after all- had three pple asking me to come out. and my mom also is interested in seeing 'untold scandal'.   i am not alone in this world after all.  im looking forward to next weekend. trekking in mt ophir is a likely prospect.  had another dream of rajpal. that i met him while studying in grad school in hawaii. i am still seriously hung up about this guy. i have to forget him. obviously he has already forgotten me. so what the heck am i doing? gotta pscyhe myself: paula, forget rajpal..paula, forget rajpal...move on..move on... hopefully those dreams dont return.  i was thinking that taking up photography is a very good idea. it makes me view the world through such different lenses. im very serious about it.  ok i am gonna surf the net abt these things.

						   alright this whole having the weekend to myself thing is not working out. i am not enjoying this all that much. truthfully, i am just feeling very very bored. how much sleeping and tv and reading can you do anyway. im gonna dress up and go out. shopping...movie and dinner. now thats what i call a weekend.  actually my idea of a really good weekend is doing adventure stuff- trekking, diving..travelling. will do so next week. running off on thursday for the good life. havent decided where i am going yet...hmm...not bintan because manish will be there. i think it would be great to trek ophir. either that or i get on a cruise..  right now im just not really having a good weekend. i have a tendency to feel depressed all by myself. that is not a good thing. but im also being a real lazy ass about it. i mean if i asked chris out, he would definitely come out, that sorta thing. i am also feeling lazy about getting dressed and leaving the house.  i really want to do my favourite activity and that is shopping since i just got my pay. but till now, i havent lost any weight- i have tons of expensive dresses in my wadrobe which i never wear... so much for slimming sessions which i havent attended. so whats the point in shopping just yet?  the jesus/ tuesdays with morrie frame of mind has worn off. im back to regular and basic now.  i havent eaten any breakfast yet. so much for thinking of making myself an english style breakfast every day.  and i have the laziest maid in the world who tries to get away with not serving me any breakfast in the mornings.  actually i really hate staying at home because i really cant stand the way my parents handle the house affairs. firstly the maid, the most spoilt thing i have ever seen and i am uncomfortable around her. secondly the terrible house decor. thirdly that they all dont get along. fourthly, that my dad and bro is a pain in my ass. and that mom is always panicking abt every damn thing. gosh i really dont want to live here at all. of course this will bring me back to my most favourite topic of the century-why did i leave carleton and how come over there, i forgot about all of this?  anyways.  i think ill take a break from writing and figure some things out. later.

						   i just received a mail from haydon ironically. he sent me some links to other blogs by professors and stuff...  looking at those made me feel ashamed of this blog. those pple really can write.  it is a highly enjoyable read though. do check out this one: www.invisibleadjunct.com  I particularly enjoyed the piece called :'so far away' which goes into great detail about the best sort of toppings can go on french fries- vinegar, gravy, mayonnaise, curry sauce, etc. these are my kind of people.  well i keep writing in here every hour today. like i have said before and will re-iterate again, im addicted to the blog.  i was just looking at the stuff that academics write about in that blogspot and suddenly one very important point hit me. when i was in honours year, there was no time for hobbies and other activities. life was just about work, work, work..i mean i hardly went out..dinner usually consisted of maggi noodles in front of the computer and things like that.  but with this current job, im spreadin my wings and gonna take up so many things: salsa, photography, computer classes...travelling... hmm...  meaning once i get sucked into grad school, thats it . it will be a life of work work work.  i must admit that worries me a bit, yet on the other hand i am addicted to the life of work work work.  i am definitely gonna go to grad school. but not straightaway. maybe 2 years deferment would not be too bad after all

						   i was thinking seriously about jesus just now. i am must say that the two movies i have watched recently has really got me thinking very seriously about jesus. this was a man that believed very strongly in his mission. nothing fazed him. he stood firmly and he fought in what he believed in.   he stood out among all his men because of his spirit. when he looked at a person, his eyes conveyed so much. it was an honest gaze, with an understanding, ..with a wisdom. it is a gaze of kindness and of strength and of depth. you can see him evaluating his situation with clarity and with a keen sense of knowledge.   he spoke with authority and yet it was humble. he looked commanding and yet there is a beautiful simplicity to him. he wore the clothes of a commoner, but it hung on him like a king's robe... he was truly great...truly outstanding among all..  i mean of course i havent met the guy. but this is the vision i have of jesus. and this is the vision i will keep. it is in visions that one can truly seek the power and the beauty of imagination. i think when people try to be too realistic and look only at the surface, they miss an important aspect and facet of life. there is so much more in a vision , it allows you to reach depths otherwise unknown to the so-called 'real surroundings'.  when i did my thesis, i was was talking a lot of about 'epistemological spaces'. now that is something one can really grasp in reality. it is fluid and escapes a 'solid' hold...one can write about colonization in terms of conquering a piece of land or an edict that has been passed. that is solid and real evidence ..but to talk about the invasion of a mind...now that is something that transcends hard factual pieces of material...it needs a vision and it needs imagination... to be able to transcend the every day 'reality'... i think one can call it 'abstract thinking'....  to be a dreamer is not such a bad thing after all. true genius emerges from that..  i was looking at all my earlier entries in the blog again. i have written mindlessly in most of them. that is because it was days past with full of mindless activity... today is a different day. after watching those movies and watching 'tuesdays with morrie'..it has set me thinking of a lot.  in this blog however, i tend to write carelessly...with freedom...i just pour out everything thats on my mind...there is something therapeutic about this.  i was thinking about when haydon spoke about how he could not keep up with a blog. i have a take on that which may or may not be true, but its a theory. i think the thing about haydon is that he is very careful about what he says and thinks... this is a man who does not speak tactlessly and without forethought...he carries his academic training and discourse very much into his personal banter...as a result i feel it would be a strain for him to write out his thoughts in an everyday blog.... his mind is not completely at rest to the point that he would simply 'pour' inane activity out on paper...  it would be a very tiring affair for him to write in a blog.. he would consider and examine every word before he puts it out there. plus i think he is trying to maintain an academic reputation which he would not mar with mindless , simple writing...  but thats haydon.  for me im glad to have both...the mindless superficial banter in everyday life...and then there is my academic side.  when i do work on academic pieces, it is serious, focused and very argumentative. i pour my entire heart and soul into the piece. .. but in every day life....im carefree in my speech...i make a lot of mostly awful jokes...and i dont really think about anything too much.  i feel that there is a time and place for everything.  this has been a good day so far.

						   i watched 'tuesdays with morrie' this afternoon. it was highly inspiring.  it is about this college professor who is dying of some delibilitating disease and this young man comes to visit him. and they talk very deeply about life. I was very engrossed by some of the things that were discussed. Most of all, i was caught up by the old guy's choice to be a teacher. i have always wanted to be a teacher. i think educating is about one of the most noble professions in the world.  wanting to be a teacher goes very much back into how i feel about education. i think many in singapore do not realize how privileged they are to receive an education. for me, i really had to sort of fight it out to get to where i am now and i highly appreciate what i am receiving. in university, i found that many saw education as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. it was disillusioning.   i felt that reading and writing and expressing your feelings was all part of a wonderful experience. i liked that my mind was challenged constantly. i like the depths to which one could reach with the intellectual material. i liked how it made me view life differently. when you read what one has to say, you tend to be able to look through someone else's lens. someone articulate and who has had the profound awareness of a phenomena and wants to have others see what he sees. and when you read it, ..its like you see it... and the sudden flow of knowlege and that slight awakening of the mind...its a wonderful experience..  there is this sense of contentment i get after sifting through such pieces. i lie back, feeling full and warm..my mind feels stretched... i talk differently, ..with greater authority on that particular subject that has been discussed. i tend to put on a song or two to relax myself and i tend to get soaked into the feelings conveyed by the music.  after a long day of reading, i am intense and focused. i begin the writing...my words flow out and spills across the paper in high and low cadences..i am caught up in a rhythm...i cannot hear the buzz of the world moving about me.. all i hear is the scraping of my pen..and the gentle rustling of my papers...it soothes me as the pace builds up in my mind...fast and slow...a thought hits me and i furiously write and then it slowly peters out to a slower motion...i take a breath and i look out ...and then it hits me again and then another bout of furious writing....my spirit is ignited and my mind is ablaze again....  then when its finished...there is this sense of peace. ...and a quiet blissful silence...and slowly..after a long while..the buzz of the world comes in ...slowly...and gently..gently..you are transported back from that oasis to the present surrounding...  its wonderful..that period of time...when you get into a world where no one can reach you..its just you and your mind....

						   alright so i was looking at other people's blogs and they have pictures and links and everything! i didnt realize how much my blog sucked. i think im gonna look into getting myself a better blog. i talked to a couple of pple about the website idea but it seems that it can cost up to 200 bucks a year. thats quite a bit. perhaps i should look into getting something cheaper from blogspot since im so used to them already- they have blogspot premium and blogspot gold or something like that. gotta check it out.  and i was out with chris yesterday and we caught 'the passion of christ'..ok pple its not like im converting to christianity or something, its just that im beginning to find the story of jesus to be very interesting. i think the fella really existed. i mean if he didnt, then why is there so much hype about it? the passion of christ is really really gory though. i had to close my eyes most of the time. strangely enough i find myself being very attracted to jesus. i mean if he was around at my time, i would have definitely had a major crush on this fella. he is handsome, and smart and brave..what more could a girl one. and he is just so..intense..i like intensity in a man. its a rare trait to find.  i think if i made less jokes and let my really serious side show a little more, i could land me an intense man. i think i can be very very intense. but i choose instead to laugh my head off and make silly inconsequential jokes most of the time. not take anything too seriously.. perhaps ill get me a brand new persona when i hit hawaii..lets see..  like i said, wouldnt it be cool if i kept writing in this blog forever? i really hope there is a way for me to ensure that i can keep it. i mean i really dont wanna lose all this information. also if i was 40 and still writing in this, that would be way cool!! i just need to get the premium thing or whatever so that i can tack up all kinds of other stuff.   i realize that i didnt write in this yesterday. well i came to work yesterday in a very 'semangat' mood. really gonna grab the bull by its horns. after much work and flooding boss with constant proposals, i managed to get a few laughs out of the guy. i think things are starting to get better..i just need to work on my computer skills.  alright i have a whole weekend to myself and i have no idea what im supposed to do. im really wondering ...hmm...i did bring back books to read..and i never really had time to myself at home for any weekend ..i mean i was always out somewhere , movies ..hanging in normanton...never at home by myself. so i better savour it.

						   i came home in a rather sombre mood today.  mom thought that it was because i was disturbed by boss's trigger happy behaviour with firing people. but that wasnt on my mind at all.   its just that i feel that i have wasted a lot of good things that came my way. there was so much i could have done with undergraduate life, but i feel like i really messed it up with some silly behaviour and mistakes. and then of course the carleton thing. a really major mess up. and now im working in a dead end place. so its not feeling great.  i really want to be happy and just live my life day to day. i dont want problems with sleep and i dont want depression. i dont want fear and i dont want to live like a recluse. i dont want any of that anymore.  i just want to be happy and well adjusted. my youth has gone by me in a shadow...i dont see many sparks in it or extremely good memories. i had so much going for me. and each and every time, i threw it in the dustbin.  so if this hawaii thing works out, thats it. no more turning back. im going out there and this time i am going to enjoy the whole experience well and good. i am going to live my life. and im not just starting there. i am already starting to live my life. and i am going to face everything bravely and strongly. no more hiding in the shadows.

						   things are going on as usual. just spoke to my colleagues..seems like boss is fond of firing pple and basically messing with their lives. i dont think i might last out here for very much longer so its a good thing that i am fast moving towards this hawaii thing.  that girl who came here yesterday isnt coming back because boss was not willing to pay her what she deserved. good thing she left before getting fired. i just need to hang on for one year and a half. i really hope he keeps me for that long. and im severely underpaid on top of that. jeez did i really leave carleton and end up in this dump? and mess up my academic career? what the hell is wrong with me.  whenever something goes wrong at work, it only serves to remind me more painfully that i was stupid to leave carleton.

						   Day 3 of Diet and Grad School.  Diet: yesterday, i did well for breakfast and lunch. lunch was thosai with 2 veges. but dinner was a heavy affair of booze and burgers. Today i just had juice for breakfast. not a good thing. i should have had a toast too. i am gonna work on that.   also im still not waking up early and being productive.  Grad school: i did one chapter of GRE today. I am supposed to meet fairoz either tomorrow or Sat to apply for library membership. and the whole meeting haydon thing only made me more certain that this is what i want to do.  I am supposed to meet prem and chris for dinner today. i wanted to watch untold scandal actually but oh well. im gonna pick up some books from the library first for the weekend. preparing to stay in bed. cos i know 'the visitor' is coming in 2 days or so. it will hit me on the weekend. im going down.  so im all talk abt taking this and that up and not doing it. after 'the visitor' leaves, im gonna get around to seriously taking something up and not just talking abt it. also i want to start my slimming sessions and gym next week.  my father was going on and on about spirituality this morning. man, he tends to go on and on. he is really a very eccentric man. i dont really get him most of the time. well once i go to hawaii, i wont be seeing too much of dad. it would be a good break because he has a tendency to keep bugging me non-stop.  not feeling great becos pms is hitting me hard. my tummy has already begun to ache and i feel swollen. also i feel deep waves of depression.  its tough being a woman.

						   what really is happiness? really, i dont mean for this to sound so cliched but i do ponder about this. how does one become truly happy? am i happy? i really dont know. i know that im happier from before, but i was really depressed before. so im quite lost about this issue.  will going out there and doing my masters make me happy? will migrating make me happy?   will starting life anew make me happy?  will having a new lover make me happy?  what is the answer to this?

						   my flu has dissapeared. boss is back. life is busy again.  i was looking through the Singapore Volunteer Overseas thing that SIF has set up and it looked really interesting. i might do something like that in the future just for the heck of it. when life becomes too monotonous in arab street.  im a creature of habit. once im settled in a comfortable spot, its hard for me to get off it.  my folks from class are meeting on tuesday night. im really looking forward to it.  nothing much to report otherwise.

						   today was one of the worst days ever!  i woke up with a horrible flu...i was sneezing and sniffing all day, my throat felt scratchy and dry...i felt weak..i had a migraine. i slumped out on the sofa watching tv with a huge toilet roll in my lap. advisor was so kind to buy me my lunch- subway sandwiches (which i had been fantasising abt like forever since last tuesday)..he is such a dear really..i left him to his computer game and i stayed with the tv..  so anyways...i ate up an entire packet of digestive chocolate cookies (looking guilty)...yeh i know i shouldnt have but i couldnt resist them. the mcvities arent as good as the marks and spencers ones though..i tried to make up for it with having everything else healthy..uhhh, i did have an andhra spice meal of cheese naan and butter chicken....(looking shifty)..ok not much of everything else healthy. i blew my diet yet again this weekend as i do every weekend.  aah the fleeting weekend is over..tomorrow its back to the grind.  oh woe is me

						   i was doing that thing again, when i read the blog from a third person's perspective. now i understand why my friends groan when they read it and go: paula, you arent fat so give it a break already. i suppose i look really slim to most pple. ok im a perfectionist. i have a small spare tyre round my middle that im obsessed about. i have a problem with being fit because of the toll that months of smoking has taken on me (i quitted, so get off my back the whole load of you). and my hips are getting wider, no kidding.  but when i was reading the blog, i just appeared really obessive. i really oughta cut that out.  my msn title reads: - I just cant do no social puppeteering. some pple have asked me about that. well, im well known in circles in singapore to be highly introverted. i dont go to parties even if im invited because i dont enjoy 'social puppeteering'. the inane banter, the fake smiles, saying the right thing all the time. thats not me. the few times i went, i was moody and drank too much...so i spend most of my evenings now on my own with john lennon and a good book. (nowadays its coldplay)  ok i have to run now because someone just walked in. later.

						   ok so i went to the gym yesterday. for an aerobics class. it just reminded me of how gawky i was in the carleton aerobics classes. it was terrible, i couldnt keep up to the moves , i was all over the place, i got tired after 20 mins. i had to leave class halfway. i just dont have the energy. and worst of it was i wore a sports bra with tracks, no top. and in the facing mirror, i could see my stomach fat jiggling with the effort...god i was embarassed. im just so bad at this. i was quite resolute after gym class to start eating healthy. i went straight home , made a diet sandwich and had that with a banana. and water.  everytime i put some snack in my mouth, ill remember my stomach fat jiggling away like yesterday. god i dont know if ill ever lose weight. my hips look massively large. ill have to be on a really really strict diet. no more playing around with this. i got to get serious.  i even have to take in a punjabi suit of mine to the tailors to loosen it becos im getting so fat. and he just made this suit for me four weeks ago. jeez...  apart from that, i did nothing much at work this week. just some brochures and stuff. none of my job applications has gotten back to me. sigh. i wonder if i will ever get a job at all.  i have had 2 rejections from the private sector so far.  life is a little...dull right now..

						   i realize i havent blogged for some time now. oh well, ill make up for it.  so i joined amore gym and today is my first lesson. i hope i survive it.  its friday and i want to go to KL.  Boss is still not back yet.  I had an amazing rest last night. sleeping that is.  im hungry right now.

						   ok i did a naughty thing. i went to watch 'laws of attraction' in the middle of a work day (grin). and boy did it feel relaxing and great. it was not a bad show, typical romance comedy, nothing out of this world but very feel-good.  and no one noticed.  im going to the library today to satisfy my insatiable thirst for books. then ill probably head back home.  i joined amore's womens gym finally. all signed and paid for. a new solution to hit the flab. lets see how it goes.  so right now i feel very tired and bored...yawn...

						   its tuesday. the weekend seems so far away.  there are days when i wake up feeling chirpy and bright and ready to take on anything. and then there are days when im all low and tired and dragging my ol body down the tube and to work.  sometimes it feels like a grind. sometimes it doesnt.  weekends are the best. its like you are trying to do a thousand different fun things within the span of two days.  im not sure if lombok is gonna work out. im not prepared mentally for the big ass trip. also, i think boss might be back on friday and expecting to actually see some work done.   tomorrow i dont have to go in to office in the morning. i have to go to a presidential talk thing at shangri la hotel. at 11 am. yay.  today im heading out to the library and im meeting chris for troy after that. i think its gonna be a good evening. i wore my best top to work.   i made low fat sandwiches and brought them to work. i actually tried this new sandwich recipe out- cottage cheese and cheddar mixed with sweet gherkins and some mustard. on 12 grain whole meal bread. i have no idea how its gonna taste. (the cheese is low fat by the way). its the paula diet cheese sandwich. and i put in 2 boxes of raisins along with the sandwiches. its just that i get so hungry around the late afternoon. and i end up with curry puffs. this should be better i suppose.  god i hate dieting. but i love those little dresses and i would like to actually be able to wear them instead of staring at them longingly. anyways its supposed to be good for my health and all that jazz.  i was thinking this morning that i would really like to start dating. i really should. im getting old. i dont want to end up lonely.  not that im lonely now. but i might be lonely in the future. so i better revv up the scene a little. i told chris this morning that i need to find me a guy. he agreed to hit the club scene with me. who knows..i might meet someone...usually i dont, but lets see.  there is so much to do.

						   i was thinking like how, when i started this online diary thing, i felt it might not last. but its been abt three months now and im still going strong. this online diary is something that marks a particular phase in my life, when i finally got done with school and went out there and got a job.  this particular phase agrees with me. i do enjoy coming to work everyday. i dont feel stressed and im involved with all sorts of activities. its kinda fun. only now, at this stage, i feel as though life is full of possibilities.  anyways i decided to join amore women's gym after a long conference with advisor. he was of the opinion that it might be a passing phase and i might just give it a toss in a while. im not sure abt that, i want to find out. i think im investing my money in a good cause anyways and its definitely far more effective than the slimming center.   me and advisor have been squabbling of late. it all leads up to the constant feeling i have been getting that he is always on my case abt something. yeah, i know he cares abt me and stuff but he has to realize that im much happier than i used to be and so what if im not taking life seriously anymore. yeah i know i have veered off track and all that and i should get on the wagon. its like just because he has some high flying lifestyle with MNC bank with his corporate title and all that crap, everyone should strive for that too. i on the other hand am very happy to be in arab street, eating arab food, slacking in my korner, having enough money to indulge little luxuries.  only thing is that my job isnt stable and boss enjoys hiring and firing. thus the need to be on a lookout for a new job. but this is a great transitional job though. i have never had such a blast in my life. sometimes on hindsight, it occurs to me that i may not have been as happy in carleton as i am now. but then again, its hard to say. i am seriously lost abt all of this sometimes. and my dad keeps eating my head all the time. its hard.  sometimes i feel like going to india. its different, i can discover my roots and perhaps learn to appreciate all my creature comforts in singapore. i'd like to get a job there and just live day to day.

						   alright boss has finally departed to indonesia. as they say, when the cat goes out the mice come out to play. and we sure are playing.  im thinking of taking an afternoon off to watch troy at lido today. that would be something cool to do. i told advisor abt my evil plans only to get a scolding from him. oh well,...and i plan to do lombok if boss doesnt return by thursday. hopefully he wont return till next week. chris is very excited abt lombok.   ashish and his wife have been calling me out every weekend and i still havent met them yet. i do plan to do so soon. with advisor of course. i think ashish wants his wife to have some female friends over here. thus the constant calling of paula. i hope she is nice and fun.  i bought all that 'diet food': low fat mayo, cottage cheese, raisins, oatmeal, tuna in brine and wholemeal bread but i havent gotten round to preparing it for my meals yet. i will be doing so, soon. just that today was not such a good day for me having to wake at 8.30 am. oh the injustice of it all.  im glad that i have finally managed to quit the smoking habit. it was kinda getting out of hand. now i just need to have an exercise program. then ill be all healthy and vitality will be oozing out of my pores.  i keep sneezing a lot and my throat is burning. i dont know why. i hope it clears up.

						   ok i came in to office today at 8.30 am. pak rahmann only wanted me to do something on education for him. i had to actually come here and bloody 8.30 to listen to him bark some orders out at me. jeez.  apart from that all is well. i got an email from carleton, from my friend bekah. she was basically the one i was closest to in carleton and i do miss her. im glad she wrote and i hope she comes down to spore for a visit. it would be really worth her while. we could have a fabulous time touring South East Asia.  so the dreaded week is here. back to the grind. chris talked abt doing a lombok trip this weekend. i have no idea how to get to lombok, so i have to go find out.  my diet is not going so smoothly either. yesterday advisor peered at me as i had my cheesecake and he said i wasnt looking healthy. like im putting on more and more weight each time he sees me. god, every week i start off with a proper yong tau fu/ fish soup meal, by the end of the week its fried fish and chips, thai curry or something. arrgh.  im supposed to do plenty of stuff like take up language classes, learn a skill and so on. however with this current job situation where i dont know where im gonna end up i dont wanna commit myself to anything permanent for the next month.  my mom wants to come with me to london next month. thats good for me, which means i can spend more freely (evil grin). i wont be living like a pauper with mom next to me basically and i can even do france. im as pleased as punch. mom is cancelling her canada trip to come with me. i think canada sucks anyway. she is better off touring london with me. hmm maybe ill do scotland also.  alright, work beckons. later folks.

						   ok i just did this really strange thing.  i like to browse through other pple's blogs constantly and you know how i find most of them to be rather dumb and full of stupid anime pics and stuff. then i came across a blog written by a pakistani girl. this girl seemed self assured, intelligent and really wacky. the first thing that came to my mind is why, i havent met girls like her. i mean the one thing i lack is a good female friend. the last female friend acted really stupid and called me arrogant just because i won some stupid awards at the university and landed a job. the only best friend i have is advisor and he's great, but even he too thinks that i should mix around with pple.... but really, in singapore, most of the pple here are pretty...how should i put it....empty...  so i came across her blog and i was really very impressed. and then it struck me to write to her since her email was listed on her webpage. in my email, i did direct her to this site. then, when i sent out the email , i was like....oh shit, raced over to my online diary and tried to read it from a third person's perspective and it really seemed to suck. then i thought, what the hell, the damage has been done so to hell with it. the sooner she gets to know what an obsessed sort of creature i am, the better i suppose. thats the thing with blogs. its absolutely no pretenses.  so i have done the deed. i just have to sit back and watch now...  god im a lonely, pathetic thing.

						   damn blogspot. they are supposed to have this cool feature called photoblogger which allows me to post pics on my site, but i cant get the damn thing to work for me. blogger guys, are you listening out there?? puhleeze dudes, dont do this to a loyal customer.  i went for the singapore big walk today. it was a disaster. we all woke at six in the morning, bathed and changed , took three different buses to get to the place where it was fully crowded. and i mean crowded. we arrived an hour late, the heat was getting to us. the minute we reached there, we decided to get out and have some masala dosai at serangoon rd instead. it took us hell to get out of there. in the end, we reached home at 11 in the morning where i slept soundly for three hours. then i went to thai express. then i ate a cheesecake at coffeclub. then i went to cold storage to buy health food for my diet for the week (pls forgive the irony) and here i am now.  gosh it was just terrible, the heat beating down our backs...the feeling of thirst in our mouths. i cant believe we even bothered.  tomorrow, pak rahmann has ordered me to come to office around 8.30 am in the morning, i have no idea why. im gonna find out. (fingers crossed)

						   today has been one of the worst days i have had since i have been back. firstly i did not sleep well. secondly, my dad shot my head off. and im just pissed and tired now. and in the misery, i broke my diet and had a yakitori, cheeseburger, large fries, milk and iced chocolate with extra whipped cream. sniff.  and now i need to run off and meet clients. i feel run down and dead.

						   I am feeling very bleary again. I should have slept earlier i suppose. god, im tired. i feel rather washed out.  today is only tuesday. sigh, will the week ever end?  this weekend im supposed to go for the new paper big walk with sudhir and advisor. i think it will be quite interesting. the walk will be abt 5 km. the only downer is the waking up at 6 to get to national stadium around 7.30 am. apart from that, all is fine. i think it would be interesting. i get to wear a little t-shirt and get some discount coupons too.  im supposed to go for my slimming session today. it is my fourth week. i have six weeks to go. im not losing any weight. its pathetic. ill just kick myself for wasting all that money. im really bad at dieting.

						   i just finished watching the life story of bill gates. it was highly inspiring. what struck me most is the way in which bill kept on working hard despite his successes and wealth and still does so till today.   it was the thing abt the hard work- it struck me how i was doing very well at one point because i was working so hard. and how that at time, my life felt like it had meaning. i took my work very seriously, to the point that i would not at all engage in any sort of a social life. what mattered most was doing well, and giving my 100 percent. and it really drove me.  and this whole mess-up with the scholarship had sort of thrown me off track a bit. no doubt, it was an important learning experience. i need to get out of this rut and work hard and believe in something really strongly. i need that drive and that determination again. i know i have it in me.  you know, what i really wanted to do was start up my own business. to do something i really believed in. that would drive me ..that would make me start up my passion and my determination. i have some brilliant ideas which i have put on paper but i havent started up yet. and i really want to work hard at it. i want to wake up every morning and have some goal, some ambition in life. i dont want this lazy existence. i want to do something that i truly will find to be very fulfilling in the long run.  i need to snap out of this lethargy . im running a car with no driver that keeps veering off the road...  it shall be done.

						   i tried to install the tag board again. it keeps ending on the very bottom of the page instead of the side. so everyone, THE TAG BOARD IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. thank you.  so its been 2 hours since my last blog. im very hungry and im trying to write in here to distract myself from my misery.  i realize that i am indeed very obsessed with food.  no one has mentioned dr keck's wedding. i expected the class to start asking each other on email as to who is going. i asked fairoz but he wasnt invited. seems that im included in dr keck's select few which really surprised me. i always suspected that i wasnt exactly a favorite of the guy. oh well.  im back on agricultural work for the company again. god it makes me sick. i wish he would put me back on education and also send me to indonesia. i love going to indonesia. i long for those days again.  im so bleary today.

						   I realize that i ended my post on saturday on a rather sombre mode and then took off to the great outdoors of malaysia. i dont usually like leaving my blog on that sort of note. so here i set about to rectify it.  firstly, i went to malacca because it was too late for me to go to tioman. sudhir and mayank went ahead and they hated malacca and departed to kuala lumpur within three hours. me and advisor arrived at seven to malacca with the other boys no where in sight. so we tried to make a decent go of malacca by ourselves.  so this is what we did: - we went to jonkers walk - we went shopping and bought loads of things. i bought something called 'danger foods' from MPH that was pretty interesting. something abt the CAP warning of the processed foods available in the market. advisor stared at me in disbelief. oh well, to each his own. - we ate at good chinese restaurants - we walked around on dusty streets and had plenty of snacky foods which was very bad for my diet.  so it wasnt a bad trip. only thing is that we made the mistake of not taking an earlier bus back to spore and i reached home at one to the irritated tone of my father: "where the hell have u been?" and i said malacca. sigh.  i would have very much preferred the beach but frankly i didnt wanna go to tioman but to sibu instead. i shall do so in the coming weeks. maybe even do an endau-rompin trail while im at it. and cameron highlands.  as for the job front, boss was surprisingly pleasant to me this morning. i hope he stays on this note. i thought he was gonna fire me. he might but then again. lets see. on my part i have been thinking deeply abt what career i should be pursuing. teaching is still my top choice.   so its ten in the morning now and im all bleary eyed from my trip. i have to get home and sleep early tonight. its gonna be a long day.

						   i have got a serious problem. i seem to enjoy twisting small knives in my heart.  first it is the obsession of carleton and frequently going into their website. second it is the constant hung-up behaviour over my ex-beau. third, it is the listening of coldplay and dreaming of a day that will never be.  im a stupid dreamer ..and whenever reality cuts through my world...i sort of lose it a little and go into a deep sense of depression.  yes folks, i do suffer from a deep sense of depression. i used to suffer from it. now its just a way of life. and you guys thought i was a happy and well adjusted individual.  funny thing is that i received some mail from a guy who seemed very dissapointed that i didnt understand his predicament. he had some real major issues and was feeling out of it. and i think i appeared rather removed from his situation. something he said struck me: i thought you understood sadness, and i think you do... for some reason, that line struck me.  i do understand it...i do understand deep dissapointment too. very much. it is usually at this time after 1...when it hits me and then i start writing this way. in the day, all the minor little things distract me. i dont think abt it. but when im alone, and the music is playing..it slowly starts to hit me  i am a depressive individual and an ex-valium addict. what more needs to be said?

						   whatever they say abt murphy's law is really true.  boss is calling me to work on saturday for a while. oh the injustice of it all.  anyways i changed my online diary's look ..isnt it cool? i find that the words seem clearer. i like the clearer font. my blog has a touch of class now. i just love the warm coffee brown look to it. it just seems so soothing.  arrrgghhh. i hate pak rahman. and i hate his stupid company.

						   so its past five and boss isnt here yet.   funny thing is that i saw an itinerary that had my name on some roadshow to jakarta, palembang and pekanbaru. it surprised me. meaning i get to go to indonesia again? this is weird indeed. i thought boss actually removed me from all the roadshows.  oh well whatever.  so im not exactly waiting with bated breath for him to come back. im just watching the clock ticking and im hoping he doesnt insist on my coming to work on saturday becos im all set for tioman islands with the three guys.

						   So i went for the foot reflexology thing with habib yesterday. it was terribly painful. i was shocked that i was paying this guy 28 bucks to inflict such misery on my feet. but after the process ended, i felt blisfully light and relaxed. i suppose there is no pleasure without pain. and no, im not a sado masochist.   the guy at the foot reflex place told me that i was very healthy and that my only problem was sleep. i was amazed by his verdict. i mean he could just tell this from my feet? it convinced me that reflexology is truly a medicinal practice. He was spot on with manish as well.  apart from that, things are looking all that bright. Boss has called for a meeting for today at 5 pm. i shudder to think of what insults or abuses he might hurl my way. apart from that, im now seriously considering the MOE to be a teacher. argh i know ......  god.....

						   my desk is a real mess nowadays because habib has moved in right beside me and all our things are mixed up. arrgh i feel so disorganized.  the plans have changed. i am going to sibu islands but not with chris. i am going with sudhir, mayank and advisor. chris told me that he will think abt it and let me know later. the funny thing is that im having a lot of trouble in finding out about how i can get to sibu. there is a direct bus but it isnt accessible by net- as in the information and telephone numbers for booking a seat. i might end up taking a train instead. i like the train rides to malaysia because there is no need to be stuck in some giant queue. but the process is a little complicated- i need to get off the kluang station and find some way to reach the pier from which i need to grab a ferry.  i just called haydon. the status of his non-invitation to keck's wedding remain unchanged. whenever i call haydon in his postgrad room he is clipped and to the point. you can hardly hold a conversation with him. it is different when he is at home though.  habib has agreed to come with me to do foot reflexology this evening. i am excited abt the prospect. i think i might wind up feeling a million times better.  cheers to life.

						   Dr Keck is getting married and I have been cordially invited to his wedding. I must say that i was surprised to get an invitation. I have no idea whether i should go or not. there is a number of reasons for this:  (1) I wasnt exactly a supporter of his relationship with sam (2) I might see rajpal there and i dont want to bump into him. (3) I will see the lecturers there and i dont want to talk abt carleton. or be asked abt it. or be asked what i am doing with my life these days.  so i dont think i will be goin.  you know whats funny, i used to wonder why valerie avoided the class so much. i mean, yeah she had a nervous breakdown and we all understand. but she would avoid us. and now im doing the very same thing and i completely understand why she was doing it. completely. its horrible to have botched up something so big. i just feel queasy inside every other day. i feel like digging up some great big hole and dying inside.  i dont know if vern's schhweeeetie has been invited or not. he did tell me that he hadnt been. that is strange indeed if im invited and not him. i wouldnt go if he wasnt invited. make that number four on my list- because haydon was not invited. my mentor, my mock supervisor that did a better job than the whole bunch in the history department.  apart from that, i do see advisor's point that i need to be more focused in life. im trying to be more focused in life. i am trying to keep steady. the good thing is that the wave of exhaustion that has been hitting me of late is slowly dissapearing. im getting more sleep and a proper diet in me complete with fruits and veges. I just need to do more in the morning like wake up and go for a run. that would kickstart my day very well.  right now im at work trying to look busy. the only workout i ever get in the day is when i leg is to work every morning trying to get there before 9.30..i want to sign up with some club fitness thing but im not sure what to take up.  the choices are: - amore woman's gym - advisor's gym in expo  thats abt it. i will discuss this with advisor today.

						   well its wednesday at pak rahman's. i came in earlier than usual, anticipating that he might return from indonesia today. but that was not the case. so now im here trying to look busy.  the applications that i have sent out havent got back to me. I hope they do soon. I really need a back-up plan since my days here are numbered.  apart from that, i went for my third slimming session today. seems like i gained half a kilo this week. even manish remarked that since i started my diet, i appear to be getting fatter. so i decided that i need more commitment to this diet plan. yesterday afternoon, i threw caution to the wind and had a nasi briyani. on the weekend, i threw even more caution to the wind and had mee goreng, chocolate digestives, bags of chips and coke.  the fact that im paying a gargantuan sum for the bloody slimming center should be enough incentive to take this diet seriously. so today, all i had was a glass of water. actually im supposed to do this detox thing for three days according to the nutritionist at the slimming center. so im not supposed to consume dairy, meat and carbohydrates. only clear vegetable soups, tofu, fruits and water. i have no idea how im gonna survive. this morning's breakfast has left me feeling rather cranky and hungry. sob. im gonna have yong tau fu soup, a plate of fruits and a glass of soya milk for lunch. that should be filling.  apart from my constant obsession with my weight, nothing much is new. i dont wanna lose my job because i like having some place to go to everyday but the end seems imminent. i hope and pray to god that at least one of the jobs i applied for makes it through. i think its time for me to start applying to the second tier of jobs on my list. i shall do so today.

						   blogspot has some new features and stuff. apparently i have clocked in some 120 entries ...gosh i must say im impressed with myself.   habib has now joined the firm and he sits next to me at work. it sorts of livens things around here for me, at least i have someone to chat with from time to time. jim and manish remains jaded in their corners. habib is from chennai and has been to germany before...i like his cool and calm demeanour. normah sits on the other end of the office and she is usually chatting with the two new interns who sit nearby. i havent really gotten to know the interns very well...they are pretty adorable nevertheless...  apart from that, boss hasnt returned from indonesia. im dreading his return. i have a feeling that he might bring some bad news with him. i always get in some sort of problem with him after one of these 'trips'.  im still feeling very tired..exhausted is more like it. i dont sleep very well. im always tossing and turning..perhaps writhing is the word, in deep dreams...  im planning to go to desaru with dear ol chris to recharge my batteries. i told this to advisor firmly over lunch. surprisingly he didnt try to dissuade me. or go on about money or something. well i just got my pay and so i want to spend it a little. and i never been to desaru.  i did some job applications and i hope it all comes out alright.  i was talking to shirley today on msn. she is from the honours class this year. she was telling me abt how she heard abt my famous run-ins with leander. i was surprised. i didnt realize my run-ins with leander was all that famous.  well leander is doing masters now and im sitting at pak rahman's. if anyone told me a year ago that this is what is gonna happen in my life, i would have been shocked. a long time ago, lincoln invited the class to dine at al majlis..i remember looking around and thinking that arab street was pretty quaint. i wouldnt have imagined in a thousand years that i would be working here someday.  i still go into the carleton website from time to time. god help me.  issa is thinking of coming down again. he really enjoyed it here the last time he was down. i told him to go to thailand this time and that i would meet him there. there is really no point for him to land in singapore again. i have nothing more to show him. whereas, in thailand, we could do some exploring together and it would be pretty fun.  i watched 'eye for a guy' yesterday. that rachel girl is a real dumbass for giving up silvert for mark. i mean she already chose silvert..and then she goes out with mark after the show ends. now all three are going to paris. what irony. and the white guy was right when he said that she was really boring. however, she too is right in saying that he has a massive ego.  its all very pathetic. singapore doing a remake of the bachelorette? puhleeze. i hope they dont bother with any more so-called 'reality shows' after this.

						   you know, since i was about nine years old, i have been trying to start a diary. i never succeeded until now.  i have a pal who is filling in immigration papers to various countries. it seemed cool so i checked it out. i decided to file in my papers to new zealand. it looks like a good place to be. living the new zealand dream.  im doing my nightly routine of listening to coldplay. its very soothing.  today was an extremely hot day. i was at andhra spice eating naan and butter chicken. it was a good meal. i had to cab it back home because the heat was getting to me.  i am currently reading the life and loves of a she devil. the movie that had roseanne arnold playing as she devil. it a really good book. i was thinking of checking out bridget jones's diary too. its supposed to be a swell book.  i am getting back into GRE mode next week. I better finish up the maths section and just sit for that test. once and for all. i know i can do it. i must try at least. or else all my america dreams gets flushed down the toilet.  my dad is taunting me again. i cant stand him sometimes. i really need to get far far away. (this new zealand migration thing does fulfill my fantasy of running far far away)...away from dad..away from pple in the past.....far far far away...into green nothingness..into vast lands... i like the idea.  i keep sneezing and sneezing...i think im allergic to dust. i just heaved three big ones. i have been sneezing a lot of late.  i cant believe its already may. seems like yesterday when i was boarding my plane to minnesota.  im not sleepy because i slept for 2 hours in the afternoon. did a lot of sleeping this weekend.

						   it has been an uneventful weekend.  i did a lot of sleeping which was good though. sleep is something very precious when someone begins working. i need to sleep a lot earlier everyday in the weekdays too.  apart from that, i have been working hard on my resume.   for some reason, before i fell asleep this afternoon, the idea of having into go into work at pak rahman's tomorrow filled me with dread. this is a far cry from the days when i was so happy to return to work. nowadays i feel very redundant in rahman's. like i said, my days there are numbered.  i still have that fantasy of running far far away. away from singapore. away from everyone i know. that fantasy gets deeper and deeper every day.  i wished i went away this weekend, on a holiday of sorts. perhaps ill do that next weekend.  advisor usually tries to dissuade me from such activities. sometimes, i get very weary of him. on the weekends, when i finally get some chance to rest, he will pop up saying that i need to do more with my time, i need to be more careful with money, i need to think of my future, etc. it does put a dampener on my world. i knows he tries hard to be a realist and make me see through my dream world. but he needs to loosen up. i jokingly told him that he had the 'indian mentality' ...and is always trying to get ahead and be challenged and whatever. he doesnt like the way i run my life. im tired of it.  sharon called me on friday and told me that i should not be offended by what she wrote in her blog. frankly speaking, i am not. i was surprised by the call. my earlier blog has been misconstrued. i just didnt get at the point she was making. though after reading her online thing again, i get some of it and i must say its very true indeed.  i really like that sharon is taking the trouble to actually keep me in mind, and write about me. its the mark of a good friendship between us. im surprised even that she takes the time to read my blog regularly considering that it is highly banal. and i do value her frank and honest opinion about my epistemological bent of things.  time is not on my side these days. im racing against time. time is ravaging me.  but my being hung up on the old beau thing.- i gave it some thought. i think its rather indulgent of me to keep harping and obsessing on old matters. i have long ago given up this boy in my heart but i do feel the need from time to time to talk about him. i really should stop because there is no point to it. truthfully speaking, if he was to pop up in my life again and ask for me to give this thing another go, i wouldnt agree to it. i actually have moved past the whole thing. so there is really no need for me to give him any more thought. as time goes by, i am beginning to understand more and more how unsuitable he was for me. he was very unsuitable indeed.  i have to go to work tomorrow. im tired of the monotonity of my days and ways.

						   God, i actually forgot to tell everyone the biggest news.  it is offically confirmed. dr farid alatas from the sociology department has agreed to publicise my thesis in the Asian Journal of Social Science. The title of my piece is : An invasion on the mind: a study of the epistemological clash in British Malaya.  The edition it will appear on is: Vol 32. No. 2 2005.  This is a milestone in my little life indeed.  oh and i left my photography class halfway yesterday. i may never return. i realize that i actually hate photography. it wasnt what i expected it to be- i thought i would be shooting pictures and things. instead, im learning abt boring old measurements and films and ASA and what not. its really very very dull. i think im just gonna buy myself a digital camera and be happy with it. a konica minolta would be nice. sudhir has that camera. it looks sleek and easy to handle.  then im gonna find some way to paste my pics on the blog. i have seen others accomplish this.  i read sharon's blog today. there was a piece abt me. i did not understand what she was trying to say fully. something abt lunacy- how my blog musings is connected to lunacy..and then something abt me being hung up on my old beau and then something else abt me believing in conventions of womanhood....something abt me not admitting something is wrong or something like that. i need to reread the piece .i dont completely get it.

						   anyways i went for my fat test yesterday (im beginning to realize that this blog is turning into a boring account of my obsession with my weight and my diet) the lady told me i was a 30.8 - and apparently that was a bad score. I do have a lot of fat.  when i first came in, fully clothed, she asked me how much i wanted to lose and i said 5 kg. she told me, that i didnt really seem to be having a weight problem and that perhaps i was losing too much with 5 kgs. and then i undressed and she did the fat analysis and she mumbled, yeah it seems you do have a problem and i think you do need to target 5 kgs.  the thing is that i 'appear' slim because of my long legs and arms. but i do have a rather large spare tyre in the middle. i always hated that tyre. and i am getting rid of it.   if everyone is saying 'oh cmon you dont need to lose weight, you are so skinny, that means that im a master at playing up my assets and downplaying the rest. i do have a weight problem. that fat analysis confirmed it all.  ok enough abt diets, weight problem etc.  i spoke to haydon yesterday. it was a highly enjoyable conversation. I do enjoy talking to Haydon, he is a great guy and very humourous. So anyways it was interesting when he told me that he found Suhaili and Harsha to be rather cool because they were so flamboyant and different and spunky. this made me think of rajpal who has always been highly critical of womenfolk. he wouldnt have shared haydon's opinion. then i thought of how rajpal found me rather ridiculous when someone like haydon would find me interesting. thats the thing i didnt like about rajpal, that he was so highly critical all the time. someone who talked too much was a 'talk cock character', someone who liked to dress up was a 'poser', someone who was proud of who he/she was despite making a couple of mistakes was 'parading his gandh'.  i did not like these remarks that rajpal would make of other pple. especially that i fell into all three categories of 'talk cock character', 'poser' and 'parading my gandh'. I mean pple are pple. the ones who fall into these categories are rather amusing and interesting. and they can be down to earth. but rajpal was rather critical of pple like that. he would snicker at these characters. it made me pretty mad at him.  but i have to admit that rajpal tried to change his mindset. i did tell him that i felt he shouldnt view pple this way and give pple a chance when they wanted to be his pal. and he did try to be nice and not be so judgmental. so that was a pretty good thing he did. i remembered feeling rather pleased abt his efforts. its a rare day when rajpal singh takes something i say into account.  yes i do know i have started my reminiscing abt rajpal. he came up in the conversation and he was on my mind this morning. i have begun to learn to forget him of late. thats always been my problem, trying to hang on to something that isnt there anymore.  i am going to miss haydon when he leaves for yale. i hope to be able to visit him in yale. i hope we stay friends forever. and i hope he starts some kind of blog/diary thing in yale so that i can keep up with his life.   so what hit me in yesterday's conversation is that haydon is likely to be a better man than rajpal. the thing is that rajpal was center of my world for a long time, and i could not fathom anyone from NUS being a better man than rajpal. but it hit me last night that i just might be wrong....

						   if you guys dont know this, im very addicted to books. i spend one day every week at the library in takashimaya borrowing books.  This is the current book i am reading: George Orwell's: 1984  Something i read this morning made me think of this blog. I am going to reproduce it. A man decides to start a diary. This is a momentous moment in his life:  " To mark the paper was a decisive act. In small letters, he wrote: April 4th 1984. He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. For whom it suddenly occcured to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. For the first time, the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would represent the present, in which case it would not listen to him; or it would be meaningless from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.  For some time, he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgoteen what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he hhad been making ready for this moment, and it never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running around in his head, literally for years. At this moment however, even the monologue had dried up. The seconds were ticking by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him"  This is a really beautiful piece.

						   in a matter of minutes, I am out of here. and on to my second slimming session. (I have ten weeks to go)  Like i said before, I am supremely embarassed of showing the nutritionist my food consumption of the week. it includes gems like this: 3 slices pizza, coke, french fries, I plate of kentucky fried, seafood lasagne, chocolate bar, i plate crackers, cheese prata.  by the way what im reading out is my dinner section.  lunch section is excellent: green beans and rice, more green beans and rice  breakfast is always either half a cup of tea of a full orange juice fresh.  so its a matter of improving my dinner part.  today i received mails from my class mates, chee tim, jack and fairoz. it warmed me up. they are great guys. they made a common mailing thing and im happy they included me in the mails. though its always abt charlton, Man U and so on. but today i made a contribution to soccer talk by saying something abt marbeck and beckham.  i was intrigued by marbeck. at one time. loos is too much for me. but marbeck is a different story. im pretty sure little blond boy beckham had it off with her. i dont know why he even bothered marrying posh. i think geri is much prettier than posh. the rest of the spice girls look like shit.  im very hungry but im not allowed to eat anything today because they are doing a fat analysis for me. no food for 4 hours before the session and no drink for 2 hours before the session. so i have to abide by these rules.  i am gonna end up coming home in another uncomfortable slim wrap. it clings and squeezes. its awful  a small price to pay for a lithe body though. and i think i need to exercise. this alone wont work.  fann wong is advertising some new diet pill. i feel like trying it out. seems like it really works. i really want to lose my 5kgs. im very focused and serious abt losing my weight. i will lose it in time no more baggy clothes for me.  barnard would go: yeah you see, you have that anorexic fann wong promoting stuff, no wonder you feel fat. and then he would tell me off saying there is nothing fat abt me.  im convinced i need to lose weight.  by the way is anyone interested in catching kumar's "Not Guilty" at the Jubilee Theatre? I really want to go but no one is interested. drop me a buzz if anyone is . thanks.

						   i really dont get it anymore.  boss has been eating my head about the agri thing. chewing my head is more like it. i am completely lost at this section of my work. i did a good job with the education sector. then it stopped there. the agri tech thing brought me down.  another night of restless sleep. i dont recall one day when i had a good sleep. i always had trouble sleeping. all my bloody life. the valium addiction in the honours year was pretty scary though. im not messing around with that stuff anymore. its life threatening. also the addiction to stilnox and another sedative. i was a pill popper. a dangerous pill popper. took me forever to get it out of my system.  meet paula, ex-valium abuser, suffers from insomnia and has no idea what to do with her life.  the other day, someone described me as a 'pretty thing'. and i was like, yeah pretty thing..wait till you really get to know me... ill drive anyone crazy. im obsessed with everything.... ill pick and pick and pick at your brain..so beware. heck im so bloody impulsive too. it sometimes scares my friends..some of the things i try to attempt can be risky...  meet paula, seriously out of her mind, life going nowhere.  arrgh

						   i was doing that thing where i was looking through the blog. god, i seem whiny. also i worry about inconsequential issues. also i am really banal. and god am i obsessed with my weight or what. im pathetic. im ridiculous. and i seem a little superficial too.  so life goes on in pak rahman's. i got my korner where there is no tension, all going ok except the fact my days are numbered. i am preparing to take flight really soon and do some real work. government service, here i come. but not teaching though. i decided against it after some hard thinking. and i have the whole phd plans in my head.  some stupid thing that im obsessed abt is the 'turning back the clock' fantasy. also im obsessed by the notion of running far far away. i know it sounds pathetic.  to tell you the truth, i went back into a depression in the later part of the evenin today (no it doesnt mean im manic)..just felt really bloody low. really really low. i'd like to do things differently. i really would. oh please let me do things differently.  god..

						   today is a rather quiet day for me. ill be doing some shopping over at metro. and live the city life and breathe the city fumes.  for some reason today, when i was reading an outdated christmas magazine, i foresaw that i was going to have a lovely christmas this year. with a little tree. with presents. with the actual roast turkey and all its trimmings. the kind of christmas that i have always wanted.  its to do with the fact that i might be moving out. life is suddenly seen through rose colored lenses. i dont like to live in tampines. i want my own little shindig.  im getting that 4.30 hunger pang again. it comes very day. i need to bring in a cheese sandwich or something to work to stave it off. i cant keep buying the mama's curry puffs. aint no point for me to diet if that is the case.  im feeling pleased and happy these days. ( i hope it lasts) and no, im not a manic depressive that swings on highs and lows...or am i..?

						   alright this agri tech thing is really eating my head.  the resume drive will begin next weekend. lets see what i land up with folks. my days with rahmann appear to be numbered.  apart from that, im struggling with my diet. i am cutting down on a lot of food. i definitely cut out my after dinner desserts. im eating much less for lunch everyday (usually vege and 1/4 plate of rice). its only dinner where im still sort of gorging. on fast food, heavy restaurant fare or french fries or something. that has to stop. im embarassed to show what i have recorded to my assigned nutritionist. she is doing a fat analysis on me tomorrow.  i am still not exercising. i hope all that gets changed soon.  today i was in a really deep sleep. i could hardly wake up. my mom was complaining that its because of the diet that i appeared to be having so little energy. not true, im still eating a lot.  my mom is adorable. ill miss her most when i move out of the house. jeshi and my father on the other hand...i dont care..but mom is a different case. i love her to bits.  im drinking a lot of water these days. i think my skin is looking excellent. coupled with expensive estee lauder moisturisers and cleansers. my smoking habit is gone too.  everything is simply fine and dandy.

						   im going for the 'teaching as a career' seminar this coming saturday.  i might end up in a government job. my folks have been pushing me towards government for a long time.  funny thing is that i have always wanted to be a teacher. but im scared of government positions. of getting 'sucked in' the system. i might never appear again. i might just drown in the bureaucracy.  but i have always wanted to be a teacher.  im just a plain old history grad with no idea what to do with my life.

						   i keep getting a message on my msn from the 'big boner' asking me if i would like a bigger dick. all day long its been a pop up ad on my msn. and when i asked mayank if he got the message, he said no. its highly irritating. i cant seem to get it to stop.  so anyways (it just popped up again), i was watching 'the real beckhams'. it was a really bad production. posh still looked like a lizard. david looked like he couldnt care less abt anyone or anything. (it was obvious that the whole video thing was posh's idea, cos it centered around her and david was hardly in it, and when he was in it , he had this pained expression on his face). posh on the other hand seemed to be revelling in the attention. on top of that, she was talkin abt how she considers herself a real challenge to david career wise. i was like, gimme a break, the woman's singing career aint all that great, she has no real talent. she obviously was a snob and thought too highly of herself (i cant believe these very same accusations were hurled at me). so anyways, watching the beckhams convinced me that david has indeed had those affairs cos the marriage appeared to me to be empty and cold (im sure they aired it for the opposite effect). so that is my take on 'the real beckhams'.  i spoke to that friend from carleton again today. i told her if she really hated carleton so much, she could ask for a transfer. then she told me that no, she didnt hate carleton, she loved the place..that she couldnt sleep for other reasons. i felt a small stab of pain and misery at the 'love the place' bit...i loved the place too..it took my coming back to spore to realize how much i loved the place.  im trying to act like everything is ok, and im happy and i have moved on. but seriously, i fucked things up for myself by returning. working for rahmann isnt the ideal situation to be in. im very depressed. i wish i had just stuck it out there and survived it somehow. coming back here was a bad mistake. a really bad mistake. i could have been much happier. arrgh..i dont want to think this way. i want to just be fine and stable and happy.   so much for losing weight, every goddam monday i decide that i have to lose weight. my diet got thrown clear through the window with my eating kentucky chicken on one night and pizza the next night.. and i have the second appointment with the slimming sanctuary place on tuesday...and i have been truthful in recording down my pratas, fried mee goreng and other delights. the nutritionist will not be too happy with me.  im beginning to hate mondays more and more. what i hate most is waking up every morning. i just feel so tired and out of it. and the miserable bus and MRT i have to take to work. god, its a real drag with public transport. i wish to god i had a car or was driven to work every morning. i know i sound completely spoiled right now. but yeah, one thing i hate most is the travelling to work bit.  misery at its peak.  this monday onwards: i have to lose my 5 kilos. i need to wake up earlier every morning and do something good like exercising. i need to be more responsible with my health. i need to be more focused at work. i need to be happy.

						   well, yesterday i lost the famous temper again. it sure has been a long time. i have been pretty tame of late.   i dont really want to get into the details of how or why i lost it. just an old issue that never really got settled. thats the thing with unresolved issues, when ignored. they get even worse.  today is a pretty sedate day. slept until ten, read the newspaper, talked to mom, watched tv, read my novel and now surfing the net.  im supposed to go to a hotel dinner tonight to meet ashish and his wife. im not sure if its gonna work out. so here i am.  i am also supposed to be working on that resume. i do want to work on that resume. i will work on that resume.  my grandfather called today. same thing abt my getting into the government service. he has been trying to push me for some time. i told him ill think abt it. he keeps insisting that i should think of 'long term'. yeah well....  today i was thinking that having a kid might be nice. i mean not now, but perhaps when im around 32.. i could be very fulfilled with a child. i cant imagine not having children. it is just a matter of finding the right husband.  the way things are going these days, i might wind up just never getting married.  i think im a motherly sort of person. i took up childhood studies in my social work programme. this means that i am equipped with knowledge about how children's psyche are and how to raise them well...that should stand me in good stead. i think i would make a good mother. and i also think i would make an excellent wife. thats because my two greatest hobbies are cooking and sewing. i am a very domestic person. i also like to house decorate. and also, i think any man would be lucky to have me. i can be warm, caring and extremely loyal. (ok this is not an advertisement for a husband to be)  so anyways, apart from that, im all alone in my room on a sunday afternoon....the whole day stretches before me..

						   well im here at advisor's place. there is some really good music playing- buddha bar and cafe del mar. chris had given it to me as a birthday present.  its really funny writing in this blog today because advisor is watching me this time. and im reading the words aloud to him as i type. its all very amusing.  we had a good morning. we went to the metro fair at singapore expo. that was followed by some malay food which was really greasy and unappetizing. then we took the MRT to normanton. so here i am now.  i was hoping to do more today, like watching a movie or eating at someplace fancy. however advisor is very tired because he was out partying until late last night.  he and i are supposed to be working on my resume to meet up with some exciting things ahead. ill push him into it later. advisor is an excellent resume writer. he should be the journalist, not me.

						   i did that thing again. i looked at other people's blogs. there is this girl in illinois that is quite interesting. u know how illnois is actually pronounced eel- ler- noy? i pronounce it elli-noise. oh well. just like how i pronounce rendezvous as ren-dez-vos and not ron-dey-vu  to other things.  im still sick and the nose hasnt cleared. great news though, i might travel to india with ajit. its in the plans. have to see how it goes.  i'd like to go to a cold place though. like the himalayas.  haydon wrote to me today with a very interesting article. its stuff like this that reminds me how badly i wanted to do grad school. sigh.

						   well, well well...  i am here at work now. just tying up loose ends. i have to hand in my resignation letter to rahmann this week. if i wasnt so ill with flu, i'd be a lot more pleased. i'd write in a more glorious way. ill ponder and attack every little facet of this new turn of my life. but alas, my mind is not working at its best. im drowsy and stuffed up with phelgm.  mr double standards got into my computer and erased my msn messenger. the nerve of the guy. thank goodness that im leaving this joint or else ill hang the bloody motherfucker.  im not including him in my treat to the others.

						   i slept the whole day away today. fell asleep at 6 at woke up after 12 midnight. its crazy, i know. im very hungry because i havent had dinner. feeling out of it. its all very surreal when you sleep while its light and wake when its dark. i sleep so well these days. i wonder why sleep forsake me so, when i was out there in minnesota. sleep is such a precious thing. it can really screw you up when you cant sleep. well all i can say is that i have been sleeping like a log from february until now. gosh i cant believe its gonna be july soon...five months have gone by me in a flash...  i think things might look up for me next week. i am making some important changes in my life.  i selected yet another lousy set of books from the library. the book i got currently is boring me to tears. and its the only one left from the set. same thing happened last week. i might pay the 21 bucks to get to borrow 8 books in a week. so that it can be a variety of cookbooks, travel books and fiction for me. only problem would be dragging the books home i think. god, i wish i had a car.  its like 3.30 am here right now.  i am still praying for the MOE letter to come in. i hope it works out next week. i really cant work for rahmann any longer. and the applications i made to STB and the polytechnics never got back to me. so much for being a gold medallist.

						   Invictus by William Ernest Henley. 1849–1903  OUT of the night that covers me,      Black as the Pit from pole to pole,    I thank whatever gods may be      For my unconquerable soul.        In the fell clutch of circumstance            I have not winced nor cried aloud.    Under the bludgeonings of chance      My head is bloody, but unbowed.        Beyond this place of wrath and tears      Looms but the Horror of the shade,    And yet the menace of the years      Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.        It matters not how strait the gate,      How charged with punishments the scroll,    I am the master of my fate:      I am the captain of my soul.

						   i realize that i havent done a good write on this blog. so here i am.  i went out yesterday to see 'japanese story'. i wouldnt say it was the greatest movie. it was kinda dull. but it did have some funny parts to it that saved it from being a total bore. mayank came with me for the movie, and later i took a ride on his kickass bike. i must say it was very thrilling. man, i wish i could ride. but when i think of what happened with arun, legs broken and everything i get relaly worried. so i think ill stick to cars.  im still waiting for the MOE letter.  apparently mary kate olsen of the olsen twins is in rehab because of an eating disorder. poor tyke. must be hard to be under the limelight. i can hardly tell them apart. they look rather adorable.  i feel like taking some leave and going away somewhere. its getting quiet at work.

						   ok bear with me here. im gonna put down one of my most favourite poems by ts eliot and its very very long. here goes:   THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK  by: T.S. Eliot (1888-1965)  Let us go then, you and I,  When the evening is spread out against the sky  Like a patient etherized upon a table;  Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,  The muttering retreats  Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels  And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:  Streets that follow like a tedious argument  Of insidious intent  To lead you to an overwhelming question ...  Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"     Let us go and make our visit.  In the room the women come and go  Talking of Michelangelo.     The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,  The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,  Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,  Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,  Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,  Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,  And seeing that it was a soft October night,  Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.     And indeed there will be time  For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,  Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;  There will be time, there will be time  To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;  There will be time to murder and create,  And time for all the works and days of hands  That lift and drop a question on your plate;  Time for you and time for me,  And time yet for a hundred indecisions,  And for a hundred visions and revisions,  Before the taking of a toast and tea.     In the room the women come and go  Talking of Michelangelo.     And indeed there will be time  To wonder, "Do I dare?" and, "Do I dare?"  Time to turn back and descend the stair,  With a bald spot in the middle of my hair--  (They will say: 'How his hair is growing thin!")  My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,  My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--  (They will say: "But how his arms and legs are thin!")  Do I dare  Disturb the universe?  In a minute there is time  For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.     For I have known them all already, known them all:  Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,  I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;  I know the voices dying with a dying fall  Beneath the music from a farther room.  So how should I presume?     And I have known the eyes already, known them all--  The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,  And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,  When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,  Then how should I begin  To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?  And how should I presume?     And I have known the arms already, known them all--  Arms that are braceleted and white and bare  (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)  Is it perfume from a dress  That makes me so digress?  Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.  And should I then presume?  And how should I begin?     Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets  And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes  Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...     I should have been a pair of ragged claws  Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.     * * *    And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!  Smoothed by long fingers,  Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,  Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.  Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,  Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?  But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,  Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,  I am no prophet--and here's no great matter;  I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,  And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,  And in short, I was afraid.     And would it have been worth it, after all,  After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,  Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,  Would it have been worth while,  To have bitten off the matter with a smile,  To have squeezed the universe into a ball  To roll it towards some overwhelming question,  To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,  Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"--  If one, settling a pillow by her head  Should say: "That is not what I meant at all;  That is not it, at all."     And would it have been worth it, after all,  Would it have been worth while,  After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,  After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor--  And this, and so much more?--  It is impossible to say just what I mean!  But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:  Would it have been worth while  If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,  And turning toward the window, should say:  "That is not it at all,  That is not what I meant, at all."     No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;  Am an attendant lord, one that will do  To swell a progress, start a scene or two,  Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,  Deferential, glad to be of use,  Politic, cautious, and meticulous;  Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;  At times, indeed, almost ridiculous--  Almost, at times, the Fool.     I grow old ... I grow old ...  I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.     Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?  I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.  I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.     I do not think that they will sing to me.     I have seen them riding seaward on the waves  Combing the white hair of the waves blown back  When the wind blows the water white and black.  We have lingered in the chambers of the sea  By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown  Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

						   well as you all can very well see, i have finally gotten the hang of the photoblogging and I have posted some pics. enjoy.  apart from that, i survived monday. i ignored mr double standards which worked well. i met mom after work and ended up polishing a plate of fried chips..yeah i know. and i watched tv. and i was on the net being real happy abt posting my pics. so now i have every reason to get me a nice digital camera. im eyeing the konica minolta (the one that sudhir has). it has a nice look and easy feel to it.  the teaching letter still hasnt come in yet. i pray and hope with all my heart that everything is gonna be ok.  funny thing is that i had been corresponding with 'Man' on email and i wrote him an email like ages ago abt how things were going with him and he never replied. so 'Man', if you are out there, please reply. just wanna check how things are going with you.  im tired. its twelve. i need sleep.

						   its monday.  its getting soooo monotonous.  anyways sunday was alright. i did a bout of cycling which turned out to be very pleasant. it also reminded me that i really need to get in shape because i got winded pretty easily. Matt was really nice, we talked abt Michigan, USA in general, what he is doing here and all that. we had turkish rolls which were really delicious at one of the little diners at east coast beach. all in all, i had a very nice day.  things arent too bad at the office today. im learning to cope with mr double standards and not let it get to me.   advisor is back from KL. i am looking forward to seeing him at lunch.  on the paper last evening, there was some coverage on hair straightening, abt some korean method that doesnt damage hair and that the volume of the hair remains full and it looks very natural. the name of the salon is Jiwon Studio and it is located in Wheelock Place. I might give it a go. Im tired of my thick curling hair. i just dont want it to look flat and ironed out on my head.  im waiting for my teaching letter with bated breath. i think i will feel very dissapointed if i dont get into teaching. so i really really hope the letter comes soon and that i got in. and im waiting for NUS to grant me graduate tutorship as well. i hope that works out. i am praying my life pulls itself back together soon.

						     Cookie Monster's Bulimia Nervosa    Yes, cookies *are* good.  But too much of anything is never a good thing.  Instead of bingeing and purging, try to regulate your eating habits.

						     Lucky you - you are the Belle of the Ball. Looks, wit, charm,  accomplishments and money - you have them all.  You are the toast of Society, and have received offers from no fewer than three Dukes.  There is no-one who does not love you on sight.  Sound good?  It isn't, because to compensate for these riches, the author has something very nasty indeed in store for you. I mean, she does have to write a novel here, and you can't expect to be happy all the time. So, you have a Dark Secret.  Or perhaps a Secret Love for the only man who does not appear to desire you.  Or maybe you will be kidnapped, or become embroiled in a scandal, or be wagered and lost by your brother in a card game.  The possibilities are endless, but you may be certain of two things.  1) You will not get through this book without some kind of scandal being attached to your name.  I'm sorry, but that's just how it is. 2) Whatever it is, he (the man of your dreams, that is) will fall in love with you,  rescue you, slay your opponents, defy your detractors, marry you and live happily ever after.  This is a romance novel, after all.    urlLink   The Regency Romance Quiz: What kind of Romance Heroine are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   My situation at work is not getting any better. Mr Double Standards has been really getting to me. I dont like him very much and he has been rude and sarcastic. And i really cannot work for Pak Rahman anymore. i am not using my talents and my intelligence, i sit around doing nothing all day. this is a very unsatisfactory job. i told shahrom today, if i dont get into teaching ill hang myself.  talking abt shahrom, he took me out on a drive today to jurong and back. it was nice. i enjoyed my ride.  tomorrow im going to the east coast park for a bout of cycling. i have made a new friend, an american who actually went to carleton for a while. he is in NUS now. fancy that. we plan to do some cycling. i am really looking forward to it. yes, my social life does seem to be looking up.  today was a bit dull. i spent my morning watching barbara streisand movies with mom. then i went to jurong with shahrom. then i returned home and read my new book called 'madras on rainy days'. then i watched 'father of the bride pt 2'. then i went on the net. then i watched 'the next joe millionaire'. now im back on the net. i plan to watch 'scrubs' at 12.30 pm.  i really wonder what i will do if teaching rejects my application. i think i will feel.. finished... my mother has been praying fervently at the temple for me to get into teaching. she has vowed to go there ten times. her second visit was this afternoon. i love my mom.  the idea of returning to work on monday and seeing mr double standards fills me with dread. i hate him. he really shouldnt step on people that way. he will never know whats coming to him. breeding hatred in people's hearts can only lead to a bad end. he has no idea what i can do to bring him down. he is putting ideas in my head and vengeance in my soul.  yes, as you can see mr double standards has really made me angry.  advisor has left for KL and i havent got one single call or email from him. i hope he is having a good time.  and sudhir and his friends have left for desaru.  i dont like the idea of not travelling in the weekends. i feel so bored.

						     You are the color red.  You are the most controversial of all the colors.  You are often easily angered, but as easily as you got excited, you come down.  When angered, do you have the tendency to be malicious?  Afterwards, do you end up begging for forgiveness?  Maybe. But you're incredibly generous, and, odd enough, needy.  You love to hate, and sometimes, you hate to love.  This color describes you as generally edgy.  When in a bad situation, you're pessimistic, and when you're in a good situation, you're extremely optimistic.  You're painfully tempermental, and sometimes it hurts the ones you love.  But with an exciting and stimulating attitude, you enjoy talking to people and being social.  But aside from your bold and outgoing attitude, you're attention-needing and attention-getting.  This color is associated with lust and desire--and you are both lust and desirous.  You're a protective person when it comes to the people you love.  You're incredibly sharp-witted and powerful (not to mention intelligent!).    urlLink   What color are you?

						   I wonder if i have given kash the wrong idea that i thought his not wanting to come to singapore is an immature act. i did not see it that way. but his mail implied it. oh well.  there is someone at work that has really been pissing me off. someone who employs double standards. but im not gonna talk abt him. i dont see the point of bitchin abt anyone online.  my first pilates class went very well. i am going for my second pilates class in 5 mins. im trying to lose weight. yesterday, all i had for dinner was oatmeal and raisins. im very proud of myself.  im going to the library tonight. to borrow some books for the weekend. i lead life so constructively these days.  i hope teaching takes me in. im getting scared as the days go by.

						   i am so so so so so bored right now.  i went to manish: "do you have any work for me?" he said no. i went to siti: "do you have any work for me?" she said no. I went to Boss: "need me to do anything?" he said no.  so its not like im slacking off in my korner. there really isnt any work for me to do.  so i was on the net and i was checking my mail like a gazillion times and i chatted to pple on msn.  im bored out of my mind.  i could leave work right now and no one will notice. working for rahmann is like being on an extended vacation. i come here and browse the net all day. arrgh.  sometimes there is so much to do. and then, there are days like this.  double arrgh.  i signed for pilates class at 6.30. thats where i am heading to.  i cant find anyone interested in going to bintan with me. advisor wants to pack for his new house. i think mom is tired out after the cruise. and chris is just acting weird these days.  so anyways its not even three here and already im dying. i need to do something with my life. my youth is passing me by.

						   I have decided that if i dont get into MOE as a teacher, I will do my masters in Hawaii. That is my decision. So as back-up, i really should work hard on my GREs. Also, i really should tone up for the wonderful beaches of hawaii ;)  Shahrom thinks that i will definitely get into MOE because of the huge shortage of teachers. if i do get into teaching, i will do my masters in 4 years, when my bond ends.  that is my decision.  i keep crashing my diet. yesterday i had fish soup and everything. then i felt so hungry at three. then i had three curry puffs. and then i had fried chicken and curry for dinner. so today, i laced up my sports shoes and im ready to hit the aerobics center again.  my never-ending battle with flab.  there are days when im deeply filled with resolution. there are days when i just flounder into nowhere. i really shouldnt waste my precious time. meaning that it is rare to get a job like this which gives me so much time. ill be kicking myself when im burdened with work in MOE.  actually i wanted to go away this weekend to make up for last weekend. alas, i have no one who wants to join me. i was thinking of bintan actually. oh well. the cruise was such a bad idea. arrgh.  and that is that.

						   this has been such a bad day. i feel so out of it and i feel sorta washed out and not at all refreshed for the week.   i listened to some music, watched tv and i still feel like shit.  another week, another day, life life life.  i still keep thinking abt kash's mail. i was surprised when he told me he kept up with the blog. he seems to be very happy in australia. the last time he came back to singapore, things didnt go very well between us. he was very depressed for some reason and he kept a lot to himself. and i was very bogged with thesis work. i understand that feeling when returning to spore, how it feels so hot and so crowded. i had the same feeling when i returned from minnesota. but one gets used to it after a mth. he seemed relieved to head back.  i wonder why he is involved with something that obviously looks like it has some trust issues problem. surely, he is at a stage (and age) to see how stupid that is. but it is not in my place to say really. and i know he will get really sensitive abt my discussing something so personal abt him on a so-called open air forum.  he marvels that i can air my feelings through such a medium. but no one really reads the blog apart from very very close friends. so i dont think im really 'revealing everything online' or something. it would be rare for someone to stumble upon the small queen's chronicles.  Lady Strange is pretty manic abt confidentiality on her blog. i was shocked to read abt how her friend sort of blew her off when she tried to help him out the other day. she really shouldnt keep his company, he sounds like a real jerk. im glad she told him off.  on one hand, i hope kash returns to singapore so i can talk to him and all that. and on the other hand, i think it helps our friendship for him to be somewhere so far away. we have a knack of rubbing each other up the wrong way. when i saw him last, i was still my stupid moony self-absorbed self. i really have come a long way since then. but whats the point of convincing him how much different things are or how i can be a better friend. our past is pretty much carved in stone and there is no changing some bad times that had existed between us. and i suppose the whole rajpal thing hurt him a lot. gosh, i didnt mean for it to upset him in any way. i didnt expect him to even read the blog all that much. i mean...the blog is so damn banal for god's sake..i wouldnt read it after some time myself. i hope he doesnt take the rajpal talk too much to heart because its not really like that ... i have my issues with that relationship because of the terrible way it ended. and my stupid behaviour. and i felt i let rajpal down big time when he needed me most in his honors year, and now he hates me. who can blame him, sometimes i hate myself. whereas in kash's case, he went off and went to another country and found himself another girl. so i dont feel broody abt that at all. in fact, if anything i feel so happy for the guy.  oh well.  so today has not been such a good day for me. i dread tomorrow, and the day after that and the day after that. i am so tired.   life can get tiring...it can get monotonous. and it can get disillusioning.

						   ok, this is the lowdown.  firstly i had a really lousy trip despite shelling out 500 bucks for my ticket. the cruise completely sucked. i was so bloody bored and there was nothing to do on the ship. i would have had a better time in malaysia or something. what a waste of 500 bucks. now i just feel so unhealthy as i over-ate on the ship (they give us a buffet for every meal)  secondly, i went to ashish's house today and met his wife. she is really nice and i liked her instantly. things are looking up, perhaps me and advisor can hang with these two more often.  thirdly, im thinking i might not get accepted into the MOE because of the carleton thing. had a call from the center, i dont know. things arent looking so bright. im a little worried.  im very exhausted right now but i feel that i have done nothing with my weekend. its awful. i wont feel good returning to work on monday because i dont feel well rested. it was a really lousy trip.  im feeling sorta pissed right now. and sorta tired.

						   Life is GOOOD!  Firstly i nailed the interview yesterday. well im not sure if im gonna get accepted but i definitely nailed the interview. and on top of that, it turns out that my ex-secondary school history teacher was on the panel. what luck! i mean fancy that!  ok second thing. im gonna go on a cruise this evening. yay!! with mom. good food, plenty of rest and good ol fun.  i think im gonna end up a teacher. im happy. i always wanted to be a teacher or get into the academic field and i am doing that indeed. i think ill make a great teacher. i think im gonna be really pleased and happy with my life. i get to work with young pple. what more can i ask for. ill make a great teacher, ill make a fabulous teacher.  Pak Rahmann and Arab Street was one phase of my life..... and i think there will come another soon..

						   i wrote to prakash today and he wrote back. i just asked him how life was going and things like that. he asked me what happened to going overseas and hawaii plans. after careful consideration, i felt teaching was the best option for NOW. this does not mean that plans to try out someplace new is dead. it just means that i know with this, a teaching cert and experience, it will strengthen my case for immigration, should i choose to do so. im biding my time baby, im biding my time.  apart from that he spoke abt how reading abt rajpal made him a little disturbed. that sort sent a prickle in my heart. i realize that i have never spoken abt prakash in this blog whereas on the other hand, i seem awfully moony over rajpal. well, the reason why rajpal gets mentioned more than kash is because he was the last real boyfriend i had, and that was it after that. so being the last one, he leaves the largest impact in the sense of time.  truthfully speaking, kash deserves way more credit than rajpal. he sure was there for me a hundred percent. if i recall correctly, (passed my rose tinted lenses) rajpal grumbled a great deal. complained too often. was not very happy with me. i dont know. i dont talk abt rajpal anymore. i have forgotten him. really, i have. im done with him and im glad i didnt marry him. i would have been amazingly unhappy right now.  one thing that made me feel a little sad was that kash was reluctant abt my visiting him in australia. for some personal reasons related to the current people in his life and their trouble with grappling a visit from an old ghost. oh well, i was really set to see him now that i have the dough to do so. i hope he does consider it if it is possible in the future. otherwise, ill just grab advisor with me and we will head to the gold coast on our own.  talking abt advisor, he is being such a darling these days. he actually sent me back to my office in the pouring rain after lunch at city hall. and he is very supportive of my joining MOE. he is actually more concerned than i am abt the whole thing. i really appreciate having him in my life.  well i have said enough. time for me to get into the MOE website and read abt their core goals and programmes and stuff.

						   alright so its monday.  life is a bit of a drag. cant wait for friday, cos thats when me and mom go on a cruise!  apart from that, things goes on as usual.  im a little depressed abt signing a four year bond, but really there aint a heck of a lot of choices for me out there. so i might as well just be happy and work.  im so sick of everything. i feel like going home and sleeping. like a great big log.

						   I have an announcement to make. MOE has asked me to come for an interview to be a teacher. I dont know how i feel about it yet. but it sure will be a lot more stable than pak rahman's job.  apart from that nothing much is new. i still havent lost any weight. i went out today to ikea and tried to watch a movie except they werent playing it at a time i was comfortable with.  oh and i went out on a date on friday night. yes pple, the proper sort of boy asking girl out sort of date. i met a guy who is some big shot director and he was in china jump when i went with jaclyn. he is from bombay. he insisted on sending me home. then he asked me for a movie. we went out on friday and we caught 'eternal sunshine of a spotless mind' and we ate food at al majlis at arab street. he has since returned to india, but we will probably keep in touch by email. it was pretty alright, the whole date thing. i liked having to get dressed up and perfuming myself. i felt like ok, i actually do have a life.  so that was my exciting weekend.  the small queen abides.

						   im reading a book by pearl s. buck, and this piece really hit me. it reminds me of my current state of life.  "she had come upon impulse, drifting as she had drifted all her life, but yet not aimlessly or helplessly. in search of beauty she drifted, caught upon her dreams as an empty shell drifts, floating upon the waves of the sea. she was conscious of emptiness, and she was conscious about the need to be filled. surely the meaning of need was capacity. her capacity was for reality, but reality was still vague and she could not define it in words. she has learned however, that reality was not always beautiful. whatever reality was, it was truthful, it had no concealments, it made no pretense. it was life, deep and glowing."

						   i feel very calm today. went around running errands and caught up with the gang at the architectural firm. got a letter from rahmann stating the work i did there and all that. all was well. later met mom and ate some chinese fare, and also did some shopping at U2.  im feeling positive, no matter what the outcome might be with NIE. im not worried anymore. i will always have other options. i have a stellar record after all. surely i can land the job someplace. if not in singapore, i could do a teaching certificate overseas. so im feeling ok on that front. becoming braver and not putting all my eggs on one basket.  also im leaving for tioman with chris tomorrow. im really looking forward to the sea and sun and sand.

						   i am quite amazed by the stuff i am learning in school. they are actually telling us that it is alright to argue with the content of a school history textbook. i certainly did not expect such a revamp in the system. the classes are challenging and the sort of assignments we have is certainly not easy. i like the work, i want to keep busy and i know that im going to enjoy being a teacher immensely.  the matter of whether i get to stay in nie is not confirmed yet. it does fill me with dread, but im not as affected as i was last week. the fact that im doing work, living there and buying textbooks soothe me somewhat that things might not be so bad after all. its hard to come into NIE in this kind of mode because im so happy to be in NIE and yet, im holding myself back and feeling worried. im in limbo basically. its not easy. but im trying.   i must say that when one is placed in situations such as what i am in now, one becomes more observant of the world around them. im not as complacent as i used to be. i listen more carefully to people.&nbsp;i look at people in the street, cab drivers, cleaners, people...i admire them. they are not in a fancy job but they take life as it comes. they have strength. i have grown up a lot this past year. i do know that i will proceed with life in a cautious way. i am so much more aware.  and i treasure all that i have. a good friend calling to say hi. a decent meal out in town. my mom calling in the night to ask me how i am. i have learnt to appreciate the little things in life. and that has helped me to grow as a person.   i have three days of holiday. i might be going to tioman with chris. to sort of get my mind off matters and enjoy myself.

						   today was the first day of school. i must admit that it was pretty interesting. the classes were not so fun though- its like history 1101 all over again. but the pple are really friendly. im glad i took literature instead of english because the english majors in school are really having quite a tough time with a lot of homework and having to teach saturday classes.  things are fine on the hostel front as well. im glad im not alone in a room by myself. even when we dont chat, it feels nice that there is another presence in the room. makes me sleep better as well.  as for the impending doom, im trying not to think about it. i wish it wasnt such though, then i can really enjoy my first few days and not feel so ragged with mental exhaustion. my heart feels leaden.   the pple in my class are really friendly. i think im gonna make a lot of good friends.

						   yesterday i went out with some friends. it was fun.&nbsp;i was being humorous and goofy as usual. at the back of my mind, is the terrible possibility that life may not work out as i intended it to. but i suppose&nbsp; have to do my best in the meantime.  i am moving to the NIE hostel for real tomorrow. im still very mentally exhausted. i have to pull myself together and face what comes my way with faith.  im tired.  its hard to keep up the appearance of being happy when im so tired.  im hoping for the best.

						   i have just returned from spending a night and a full day in NIE. i agreed to meet Shirley last evening to sort of get my mind off the possibility of not entering the NIE. we stayed overnight in our room. i like the place, fresh air..., away from everything.. today i went for subject briefings and im excited about the modules that i will be taking.  the days arent as bad at the nights. the subconscious is a terrible thing. my sleep has been badly affected. i dream of being chased by large groups...i dream of fearful consquences...my heart pounds erratically throughout the night because of these dreams. i wake in the wee hours of the morning unable to sleep again. and this affects the days because im so physically and mentally exhausted.  i felt better when i was attending school today. being with my friends. i am not ready about the possibility of not getting into teaching and i am not going to think about it. because i might just get in.  im so tired. this phase is true hell.

						   sharon gave me some interesting advice yesterday. it is important to have the ability to laugh at oneself and its situation. im trying to see humour in the recent turn of circumstances. i suppose at times, situations occur to test one's grit and determination. im trying to be optimistic and make jokes and be my goofy self. its hard.   the mistakes i have made this past year have imparted to me my most deep rooted lessons. there were times when i was actually glad to have made such a major mistake with carleton because it was from there when i became wiser and stronger..i saw the world very differently. i sobered up. i was&nbsp;a happier person. and i appreciated the little things in life. it is when so much is taken from you, that you cherish what little is left and you treasure any opportunity received in the future.  but the price to pay for a mistake weighs heavily on the soul. i have regrets. i think thats the worst thing anyone can carry around. regret is a terrible thing because there is nothing you can do about it. its something you did, which you can never change.   my days are filled with half forgotten memories that leaves me with a bittersweet sadness. when i am laughing, it comes in a shadowy way to remind me that there was a time i thought i could never laugh again. it has left such an impact on my heart and on my mind. my life will never be the same again. i am not as carefree as&nbsp;i used to be.  something occured today that made realize something. i was talking to mom about the possibility of my not getting into NIE and i suddenly broke down and from&nbsp;my very depths i blurted&nbsp;, 'i have paid such a heavy price already, i&nbsp;am so sad and im no longer the happy girl i used to be.. i have had so much pain and surely&nbsp;i shouldnt be punished any further. i have been completely ripped apart and i cant bear any more....im done with it all. i just need to move on with my life. should i be punished forever for this mistake? im human as everyone is. i make mistakes. how long does this have to go on?...  i need to move on.

						   i just came from dinner with mom. had some pizza. sukhdave called me earlier, wanted to introduce me to his cousin, whose name..get this..is rajpal. like how ironic is that. so i said, sure i can meet your cousin and perhaps friday will be the day i meet him. &nbsp; apart from that, some stuff is going on that is getting me very down but im not gonna put it in this blog. like i said, i know you fellas think im candid but&nbsp;i dont exactly reveal all. im sure its becoming apparent that it is getting me very down indeed. &nbsp; i just hope that i can move into NIE, move on with my life. maybe meet someone special. who is good to me. and if that doesnt happen, its no great matter. &nbsp; i like my roomate though. im beginning to see her as a confidante and i like the way she is so expressive. on that front, things are looking up. and i saw my hall and i like the room and i like the general feel of NIE. im very satisfied. &nbsp; i hope nothing screws up this new found world.

						   sometimes i wish i could write what really goes through my mind. i seem to have a problem putting into words the depth of emotion and thought that run through my mind every day. when i get on this blog, i start writing in very highly simplified terms, things that i feel or think about. it does not convey what im really trying to say. &nbsp; i wonder if it was unwise to have a blog in the first place. to bare my soul. god forbid, someone who professses to be an enemy comes across it. advisor thinks that one day this could come back to me in a bad way. i wanted to keep this blog as a piece of history of my life. but at what price i wonder. &nbsp; sometimes we live in fantasy that the world is ok, and everything will work out alright. and then something comes along to shatter that illusion. its a frightening thing. is it really true that what doesnt kill you only makes you stronger? i have to say some of my experiences have darn near killed me....so im stronger? i feel so much more sobered up. more aware. like i have woken from a long long sleep. &nbsp; but im afraid.

						   today is a better day. im sort of forgetting friday and the drunken stupid behaviour. thats a good thing. &nbsp; i went with mom to temple. then i went to the tailors. then i realize i should have made one of the blouses smaller. and now i have to trek back there and get that done in the week. apart from that all is well. &nbsp; i am now geared towards NIE. meeting the new bunch tomorrow. (the friends i made from NIE, or whom i affectionately term my NIE gang). &nbsp; shahrom is so funny. he told me that he is now known by the title : The Devourer of Virginal Innocence. his roomate is known by the title " Chaos Commander 666' and halifi is known as " Lord of Unspeakeable Pleasures and Sodomy'...god that was so funny. i shall have to keep my roomate away from shahrom and his dark crowd. &nbsp; i have bought so many clothes for NIE. all set to embark on a whole new world.

						   so its almost the end of saturday. my hangover is getting better. i met rhommell for a meal. it was nice to catch up with him. he reminds me so much of his brother khyber. i wonder how khyber is nowadays. ever since he got married, he dropped out of sight. &nbsp; i have a lot of phelgm building up lately. not a good thing before medical examinations for NIE. &nbsp; im tired.

						   i actually wrote in here last night. and i had to delete that piece because it was so full of crap. i cant believe how drunk i got last night. and how weird it was, getting drunk and sitting in the rain.....cant remember much of my conversations, ...i talked to RK candidly for some reason, ..i buggered the hell out of mayank... i was really drunk and was going over the top of what i usually do. its like i speak candidly to many pple, but when im drunk, im overboard with it. and pissing mayank is what i do mildly everyday., and when i was drunk, i just overdid it.....my biggest worry however is a conversation i had with subbu on the way back. i think i said some stuff i didnt mean...like not giving a damn abt something, or nothing or whatever.... &nbsp; anyways. &nbsp; i am not good with parties. i am not good at handling being drunk. so i really shouldnt go to parties which is why i dont go. usually. i made an exception and went this time. it was nice to meet so many people. but i wished i hadnt gotten drunk...and behaved weirdly after...even im embarassed now... &nbsp; so anyways im having a terrible hang over i need to nurse my head.

						   yesterday was such a great day.&nbsp;i ended up meeting anu (ashish's wife) again at orchard, except that we planned it this time. we had dinner at nooch which is one of my favourite restaurants. then we walked down to hard rock cafe to listen to the live band and i had a smoothie while she had a cocktail. i think i have sort of sworn off liquor, i never been a big drinker anyways. anyways, we had a really good time, and we find that we have a lot in common. its nice how we could keep talking and laughing all evening without any sense of awkwardness. im glad to have a new friend.  &nbsp; today im watching 'supersize me'. then i have to go to a birthday party and see people that i havent seen for a long time. im not a social butterfly and parties tend to intimidate me. but i shall go and paste a pretty smile on my face. i hope it goes well. chris has agreed to come with me to the party. that makes things better, i hate to turn up alone to large gatherings. &nbsp; im supposed to go for moscow circus with advisor tomorrow. and we are both thinking of taking anu out this weekend because ashish is out of town and she is by herself. i think the three of us can have plenty of fun this weekend. &nbsp; dr. alatas invited me to an arabic performance. im really looking forward to it. shirley agreed to join me which is great. i bet it will be an interesting show.

						   gotta admit, im getting a whole lifestyle going these days even though im alone most of the time. yesterday i went to the tailors, and then to the slimming center and then to eat at subway and then to the library.   today im sitting out in the sun with my new book, watched tv, was on the net...its comfortable and im really enjoying myself. im gonna clean up the house and do a swim soon.  and tomorrow im going to watch 'supersize me' at the theatre. i heard its a really swell movie and i would really like to catch it.   i went back on a diet again, courtesy of the prodding of the slimming center. i made a chicken and bean stirfry earlier with very little oil and had it with very little rice.i know that in NIE its easy to keep up with a healthy lifestyle, what with the constant walking around and climbing slopes and stairs and the canteen food.  today is a really good day.

						   well the holidays are fast coming to an end and i did not holidaying. i feel rather redundant. today was alright though, i exercised and got some books from the library. i met ashish's wife there by accident (what are the odds) and we had coffee together. i like her, she is spunky and intelligent. so anyways i might take her out on saturday night. just talking abt it.  NIE starts next week!! im so excited. i hope and pray nothing goes wrong with my medical. i really want to do something different with NIE. I want to lead a very different lifestyle, be more outgoing and gregarious and to indulge in sports and healthy activities. im gonna be an all rounder this time.  so its all set.

						   i slept the whole of yesterday away, after going for the NIE registration. I feel happy that its all coming together. I like the look and feel of NIE. I miss school so much. Just entering the library was so great. i think im just of the academic breed. someone else might look at NIE and think its depressing and to me its an oasis.  i went out shopping with shirley afterwards. i told her a lot of stuff that i ordinarily do not talk about. stuff i didnt even tell advisor abt. i dont know why i did it, like confide in her so suddenly. hearing myself speak of buried events in a third person made me realize how foolish and lost i was at one point of time. i made a mess of my NUS years and i dont want to make the same mess with NIE. i know now, what mistakes i have made and i have come to terms with it. most of the time, im pondering abt how i could have done things so differently. i was naive, impatient and foolish..just bulldozing my way through life completely clueless. the mistakes i made with rajpal are simply horrendous and they account for my general state of mourning over the state of that relationship. i mourn for it because it was completely my fault. i could have handled things better. the worst thing in the world to do is hurt someone you care for the most. and living with that. but now im in such a different stage in life, and i need to move past it. it has come to my attention that he has publicly proclaimed his moving past it. and its my turn to stop obsessing with the 'what ifs'.  so back to me being excited abt NIE. i hope that i didnt ruin anything talking stuff with shirley. i really want us to get off on the right footing. i have never had a roomate before and im very happy to have one. i see it as a new beginning. a new life. and boy am i going to do things right. there is a lot i can learn from shirley, like to take things slow and employ buddhist principles in the way i live my life. i have for my part, sobered up quite a bit these past few years. i have become more the observer and it feels better that way.  today im going to exercise because i couldnt fit into anything i tried to purchase yesterday.

						   right now, im at work just packing up my things and having that thesis article saved for Dr. Alatas for publication. its basically the same things going on at work. mr double standards became really nasty when i came. first, he introduced some new girl called siti aishah saying that she is my 'replacement'. so i said, "oh is she a historian too?" and he said, "no, she is far more useful to us". then he talked to siti abt deliberately banning MSN messenger on computers for the 'good of the company'. so i spoke to normah, like what the hell. and normah told me that he has been itching to get at me in some way. i dont know what mr double standards problem is. firstly, he tells me all his secrets and stuff. and when i came in, he was trying to get my attention, telling me abt how his girlfriend purchased some new house when i really did not want to listen to that. he doesnt speak to siti or normah abt that sort of stuff, like his personal affairs. then he turns nasty on me as well. i dont understand him at all.   so anyways, im happy to see saps, normah, siti and habib. we are all going bowling together. one thing i can say is this. i have been here for only five months and i have developed a better bond with these people than mr double standards ever could. i dont think its such a big thing to be the best guy in rahmann's place. i mean, this place is the absolute pits in my opinion. and mr double standards is a jerk that no one likes. he is really stupid and has very little people skills. that is my take on mr double standards.  he can eat shit and die for all i care.  alright, apart from that...  things seem to be going well. shirley wanted to meet me for shopping and stuff. she made the move that i wanted to make. so its all good. we are doing something after the NIE registration on monday. so yep, all is good. and the new friend i made, angeline, has a lobang for the best hostel blocks and she has gotten all our info to make the bid. so all is going well. and have i re-iterated often enough how ill hang myself if this doesnt work out?  alright then. back to sorting things out.

						   keck's wedding is on saturday and im not going. i think i made the right decision not to go. firstly i dont really want to talk abt carleton and pple there are bound to ask me abt it. secondly, i have never applauded the samantha and keck romance. and thirdly, bumping into rajpal is not what i want to do right now. so yeah, i think i made the right decision though i do feel kinda weird abt it. because im the last person who would turn down an invitation. i usually enjoy such events. but going to this wedding would add way too much complication to my life.  i really would like to do something with my time right now, at least travelling. because its gonna be rare for me to have so much free time on my hands once teaching starts. but its not so simple, i cant find anyone to travel with. so yeah, it kinda sucks to just watch TV everyday.  i am currently getting ready for driving lessons. if anyone knows a good instructor, please let me know.   im looking forward to NIE. i thank god that at least that is working out and i hope nothing jeopardizes it. ill hang myself otherwise.

						   today was a great day. i met with chee tim, fairoz and jack. i really enjoy meeting my classmates. they are the only bunch of pple that really make me feel like i belong. i have never been part of a circle or a clique before, so it feels really great.

						   i dont know how i do it. i seem to have immense energy. even advisor is tired out by me. my constant questioning about everything sure can drive anyone mad.  today is the second official day of my being unemployed. i must say its all going very well and i am enjoying myself.  i havent called shirley yet. ill probably just see her on the 12th and take it from there. i felt it would be good to sort of get to know her better before the whole NIE thing starts. i dont really have a close female friend (perhaps sharon, but she has fangs sometimes) and so this is going to be a rather refreshing change for me. i am going to make an effort to get to know the girls in NIE and not just hang out only with the boys from my class.  i was talking to haydon abt grad school. he was advising me against hawaii and to go for the ivy leagues or the second tier of grad schools in the USA. we also talked about cambridge. i think i might just give up hawaii and simply bang on the doors of the ivy leagues. i might have a shot at it. i just have to try my best and improve my record. after my three years (ill be abt 29) i will fly to another place and do the phd for real and i wont look back. i wont. i will go for it. thinking of this is making me feel better. like all is not lost. basically i have to shelve any plans i might have to get married. i am not inclined towards getting married for the time being. so i think this will work out. im getting very independent these days, so i really think i can handle being alone. i just need to keep in shape and all that so that im still a looker at 35 and still 'marriageable' by those standards ;)  its a rather quiet day for me. i feel very peaceful and pleasantly sleepy. the talk last night with haydon sure took the stuffing out of me. i dont know why i was so over the top last night though, i dont think im usually that garrulous on the phone. i think its sort to do with a lot of things thats happening at home and how i used happy banter to sort of distract myself from it.  oh well. (kash hated my 'oh wells'. he said it was a cliche with me)  im going to watch some tv now.

						   well its almost three in the morning now. i just spoke to haydon forever from like nine in the night to just five minutes ago. i was rather garrulous on the phone today and i feel a litle guilty about keeping him on the line for so many hours.   i spoke about a lot of stuff that was on my mind but i never spoke aloud before, plans i have for NIE and so on. it was good to hear them aloud and have his opinion on them. these things are very important to me at this point of time.  i should give shirley a call one of these days. my new roomie. i am praying to god that everything goes well and that i dont fail my medical. or else ill hang myself.

						   Now you understand why I pour my heart out so much on this blog:    You're the classic starving artist. You thrive and take pride in the pain that you turn into art. You've probably had a very traumatic childhood and now confide in paper more than people... You have trouble remembering where you put your damn pens... all the time.    urlLink   What type of artist are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   today is my first day of staying at home. life feels good. i was so tired of working for rahmann. i was watching tv about bangladesh. man, i would like to visit bangladesh. i was thinking that i should date some teacher in NIE becos we will have the same holidays and perhaps he might travel with me to exotic locations. i think i might be happy with a teacher. oh well, ill just wait and see what fate has in store for me.  tonight im supposed to go to hard rock cafe for sudhir's going away party.   ajit hasnt gotten back to me abt india, thailand, whatever.  i have gone back to daytime soap opera watching. that means i now regularly tune in to 'days of our lives'.  i think i might purchase that camera today. the konica minolta dimage X20. its 370 dollars. i can update my blog with new pics. it can be kinda cool. the pics i keep posting are of 6 months ago.  i havent told danny that im going into teachin. james and danny are gonna share a hostel room together. boy that would be funny.  gonna have to figure out what to do with life today.

						   you know what my fear is? that ill get bored writing in this blog and it will dissapear in virtual reality and my kids will never get to see it. i want to write in this till im 62 but sometimes it gets dull writing in here, and someday it might cease altogether. arrrggghhh.  the day yawns wide tomorrow...no work..just rest...life is good..lah di da. goodbye rahmann and goodbye mr double standards. go suck each other's cock. losers. uhh, ok maybe that was a little ....harsh.. but the both of them are truly PATHETIC.  so anyways i spoke to ratish. abt this teaching thing. all that jazz. he is happy for me. i am happy for me. mom is happy for me. life is great. got new friends. james and danny and shahrom in my classes too...what more can i ask for. doing something im actually good at. yep, life is gooood indeed.  i wrote to ajit abt india. i told him i dont mind doing thailand if india cant work out. i mean after all, i cant do two weeks and all that. i dont wanna do india before my medical. if i dont get into NIE, ill hang myself. literally.  im excited abt hostel life.  its nice to feel sleepy. i went over to sleep somewhere else recently and i couldnt fall asleep for 2 nights in a row. the nightmare of carleton became more real. its funny when i started sleeping right, and i thought back on it i kept beating myself up abt why i left. then i didnt sleep for 2 nights and my brains were totally fried and i didnt sleep there for 6 weeks and now i remember. god what a nightmare.  so now im sleeping well again. thank god.  sleep is such an important thing.

						   One of my very very favourite poems of all time.  "The Loser" (1958): Adrienne Rich   A man thinks of the women he once loved:  first, after her wedding, and then nearly a decade later..   I  I kissed you, bride and lost, and went home from that bourgeois sacrament, your cheek still tasting cold upon my lips that gave you benison with all the swagger that they knew as losers somehow learn to do.   Your wedding made my eyes ache; soon the world would be worse off for one more golden apple dropped to ground without the least protesting sound,  and you would windfall lie, and we forget your shimmer on the tree.     Beauty is always wasted: if  not Mignon's song sung to the deaf, at all events to the unmoved.  A face like yours cannot be loved long or seriously enough.  Almost, we seem to hold it off.   II   Well, you are tougher than I thought.  Now when the wash with ice hangs taut this morning of St. Valentine,  I see you strip the squeaking line,  your body weighed against the load,  and all my groans can do no good.   Because you still are beautiful,  though squared and stiffened by the pull  of what nine windy years have done.  You have three daughters, lost a son.  I see all your intelligence  flung into that unwearied stance.    My envy is of no avail.  I turn my head and wish him well who chafed your beauty into use  and lives forever in a house  lit by the friction of your mind.  You stagger in against the wind.

						   today i went to the MOE briefing.  and i made some new friends.  firstly i saw shirley there. she agreed to be my roomie. she is nice and interesting and rather outspoken for a chinese girl. i quite like her. and she had three other girls with her. we all ate lunch together. it was nice, my new gang of NIE pals.  so now im back to office, my final day just to finish the last of my work. things are going well. mr double standards pretty much ignored me when i came. screw him. i just feel sorry that he has been stuck in this hole for so long.  and im gonna work hard and be happy with teaching.  so im pretty excited right now.

						   well, the thing i was most afraid might happened did happen. i lost my nie placing. i will have to leave the program.  i have decided to delete this blog. i dont see the point of keeping it. i started this blog when i first started work in rahmann's. at the time, i felt like i was piecing my life together finally after a terrible mistake. i had a lot to say because i was hopeful. i feel now like i have come one full circle. today was a miserable day.  the blog was very soothing for me. it allowed me to vent and dream and think. i found the friend i was finally looking for. i thought the blog was the best thing i ever had. when things were tough, i came on this blog and i poured out my heart. when reading the blog, i had a great deal of self discovery. i grew up with this blog, through the tumultous months. and i felt that having this was a beautiful piece of my history. someday, i felt someone very special might read it- maybe someone young of my age who saw that i too had problems at this turning point of my life. i envisioned that someday, i was going to be successful and happy and this blog would remain precious of the struggle i went through.  right now the future looks bleak. i know it may seem like im over-reacting but i really wanted to get this job. my parents want me to go overseas. i feel empty. its not what i wanted to do. i wanted to work as a teacher here with all my heart. i suppose that right now im going through a very tough time accepting that i failed to stick it with NIE. its a big blow.   my closest friends are trying to re-assure me that everything will turn out ok in the end. i am attempting humour in my trajectory. i keep joking ..not appearing very bothered about what happened. it makes me feel better to do so. deep inside, im completely numb.  one year ago, i was on top of the world. i had 2 beautiful gold medals. i was nominated valedictorian. and i was awarded the john nason scholarship.  the day i left for america, at that airport, i was heady and excited. who would have thought that i was actually on the path of disaster? i was so tired when i left...i went through a really challenging year and i worked very hard for those medals. i scarcely had a breather. and i was shipped off to a whole new ball game. and i couldnt handle it anymore. i so badly just wanted to rest. and my coming home has led to disastrous consequences. i cant even land a government position now with the carleton record looming over my head.  i will need a lot of strength to get through this.  i suppose its time for me to say goodbye to this blog. i feel sad to stop writing in here. its the only thing i have left in a way. advisor told me one day that this blog might come back at me in a bad way. and now i think it might...it just might. i have nothing more to say.. so there is nothing more for me to write.  im done with dreaming.

						   the outing with anu was a disaster. we couldnt find the hairdressers. we had a really bad waiter serving us at the restaurant. on to top it off, we had a really rude and nasty cab driver sending us home.  then my dad calls me on my way back and pisses me off with some stupid questions.  jeez.  i think there is someone in NIE that digs me. i shall call him mr prim on this blog. he is rather prim. he has been trying to chat me up and i notice him gazing my way often. im not sure yet, but it seems that he might like me. i really dont know. he isnt really the type of fella i would usually go for because he is so prim and so proper. he carries himself with dignity though and he speaks well. he isnt bad looking and has a good smile. but im not attracted to him. i just find it amusing that he might dig me since he is paying me so much attention.  i suppose i should be flattered.  apart from that, im getting busier with NIE work. boy is there a LOT of work. but im happy. its much better than doing nothing. like i said, i just hope it works out for me. i would be devastated if it didnt.

						   my room is looking really good. i cleaned the floors and got round to washing up my clothes. im meeting anu in town later to introduce her to my hairdresser.  might try to buy a nice david grey CD for myself. i get lonely in the nights sometimes and music could be a nice accompaniment.  me and shirley are getting along fine. i dont know why everyone reckons that our roomie thing could turn out explosive. we get along in our own ways. i keep the room as neat as i possibly can and so does she. and we are both early risers. so far, its looking good.  i plan to buy a bicycle to get around campus. im sick of the damned bus. its always crowded.
