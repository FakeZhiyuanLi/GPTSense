      We had a wonderful time in Houston at Christmas! Daniel and Natul's wedding was lovely and we it was great to see old friends. We are back at home and settling into a new routine. Here's what everybody is up to:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jason is still looking for a better job. He enjoys working at Rochester College, but they just don't pay enough to keep us all alive. We'd like to stay in this area - we love Rochester - the church and the people and the weather - but it has a fairly high cost of living. If he can't find something here in another 6 months or so, we are going to have to look at relocating to somewhere with more reasonable housing costs. Any suggestions?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandi is working evenings waiting tables at the Lone Star Steakhouse. The hours are okay and the money is pretty good. I've always enjoyed waitressing and until Jason finds a better job, this will allow us to make ends meet and for me to be home with the kids during the day. Jason is home with them at night and we get one or two nights a week together. I'm toying with the idea of writing a book on motherhood and to that end, I am doing a little soul searching and a little researching and a lot of prayer. I've written a poem that you can read here and I'd love your thoughts.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collin (3-1/2) is growing into a very considerate and sensitive child. He has an extremely high energy level and it is a challenge to continue to find ways to channel his energy into positive outlets. He is sitting out of preschool until he can get the potty thing completely under control. Some days are good, some are not. I suppose it's that way for all of us!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leslie (15 months old) is growing like a weed. She has a dynamite smile and has begun mimicking us. She helps set the table at mealtimes and is wonderful about picking up her room. Of course, it's mostly because she likes putting things in containers - we have to check the trash cans before anything leaves the house. Yesterday she threw away Collin's church shoes!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, we are all well and looking forward to a great year.  &nbsp;  With joy,  Sandi

      Our big news is that Jason has a new job at Walgreens. (WOO-HOO) He was hired to be a manager but their training program is a year long (or so). He started as an assistant manager in April and will probably get a promotion in July or August to be and EXA. I forget what that stands for, but it's the step between assistant manager and manager. He'll be an EXA for 3-6 months before he gets his own store and the promotion to manager. He is really enjoying the job and looking forward to the day he is in charge. He'll be terrific at it and FINALLY have a job that pays well enough that it can be his only job. For those of you who didn't know, he's been working 2 and 3 jobs at a time to make ends meet. We are grateful for that!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still a stay-at-home mom. In the fall, I'll start getting back in the swing of theatre by stage managing our church's musical which is a pretty large production. Then in the spring, I may have the opportunity to do some directing for the college. We'll see how that pans out.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collin just finished up his first term at preschool. He's doing very well and I enjoy having a bit of one-on-one time with Leslie two days a week. He'll go three days a week in the fall and is already missing his friends. His goal for the summer is to learn to ride his bike without the training wheels!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leslie is growing more every day. She is learning new words every day. The current new ones include: kitty, doggy, uh-oh, eat, bible, Debi, bubba, mommy &amp; daddy. And that's just in the last week. She'll be speaking sentences by summer's end.   &nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for checking in with us.&nbsp; May God bless your day.   Sandi&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Since I can't really do this every month, I've changed to a quarterly format of my newsletters.&nbsp; I figure, if I to do more than 4 per year then good for me.&nbsp; If not&nbsp; I refuse to feel guilty!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; September finds us healthy and content.&nbsp; Jason's job at Walgreens is going well.&nbsp; He enjoys his work and is steadily moving up the ladder.&nbsp; His first promotion will go in effect soon and he's already looking forward to getting his own store (in another 6 months or so).&nbsp; His schedule will go down from 70 hours a week to just 50 (just, eh?) and WE are looking forward to that.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collin is in preschool once again.&nbsp; He is going 3 days a week this year to what they call "pre-kindergarten".&nbsp; It involves lessons &amp; homework rather than just playing.&nbsp; We just completed his first book report.&nbsp; At 4 years old!&nbsp; Man, does that ever make me feel old.&nbsp; He's got a bike with no training wheels and he'd rather play with his new friends than with his mom.&nbsp; Sigh.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leslie is a darling child.&nbsp; She is full of smiles and is beginning to break out of the shyness that has plagued her.&nbsp; I think that having an exuberant older brother really helps her.&nbsp; She misses Collin when he is at school and wanders around the house calling, "Connin, are you?" (Translation: "Collin, where are you?")&nbsp; Then she'll come up to me and the dialog goes like this:  &nbsp;  "Connin work?"  "No.&nbsp; Collin is at school."  "Oh.&nbsp;   Daddy school too?"  "No. Daddy's at work, Collin's at school."  "Get Connin.&nbsp; We play."   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am stage managing our church's fall musical One Voice.&nbsp; It is a lot of work, but I am really enjoying myself.&nbsp; I am also a group discussion leader for MOPS (Mothers Of Preschoolers) which meets once a month.&nbsp; I'm so fortunate to be able to stay home with my children.&nbsp; I enjoy it so much!&nbsp; Please check the pictures of Collin's birthday party.&nbsp; I may be prejudiced, but they are delightful.   With Joy,  Sandi&nbsp;&nbsp;

      We are moving again.&nbsp; Oh how I hate to write that.&nbsp; WE LOVE MICHIGAN.&nbsp; We love our house, our neighborhood, our church and our friends. However the economic climate in this area (isn't that a nice way to say it's just too expensive?) is forcing our hand.&nbsp; It's very important to us that I am able to be a stay-at-home mom for the kids.&nbsp; After trying to make that work here for almost 3 years, we've just got to be realistic.&nbsp; A friend once gave me a button that said "Reality is for those with no imagination!"&nbsp; Well, we've imagined and imagined and we just can't make the numbers look any better.    urlLink         urlLink    We are moving to the Kansas City area (that's our goal) in the next month.&nbsp; Beginning July 23, the children and I will be splitting our time between my parents in Wichita, my brother and sister-in-law's in Columbia (MO) and a friend in KC while looking for a place to live.&nbsp; Jason will be finishing up some obligations in Rochester and join us the beginning of August.&nbsp; We hope to be settled in some fashion before Collin starts kindergarten in September.   Please pray for all of us as we make this difficult transition.&nbsp; We've been praying and agonizing over it for months.&nbsp; My apologies for the sadness you probably read here.&nbsp; I know that once we have a place to focus on (house, school &amp; church) that things will perk up.&nbsp; Moving is an exciting time to shed old habits and become more of who you need and want to be.&nbsp; It's just hard to leave old friends behind.   With joy,  Sandi &nbsp;   urlLink

      Well, here we are.&nbsp; Wichita, Kansas.&nbsp; Here's the scoop:  &nbsp;  We placed membership at Central Church of Christ in Wichita, KS last week.&nbsp; It's about 400 members with a strong worship leader and great kids program.&nbsp; They have a new praise team (2 teams that are on one month, off one month.&nbsp; They don't really have anything in the way of drama but mostly because there is no one to spearhead it.&nbsp; They've done plays in the past (one 10 yrs ago and one 7 yrs ago) when there was someone here to coordinate it and so the elders &amp; congregation are certainly open to doing it again.&nbsp; I'll probably pursue that once we get more settled.  &nbsp;  We are in an apartment right now.&nbsp; We didn't want to buy a house without living here a little bit first.&nbsp; We hope to buy a house next summer.&nbsp; Collin started Kindergarten yesterday.&nbsp; I was a little surprised at how much it shook me up - I'm not usually real sentimental about stuff.&nbsp; But, his teacher is really nice so I feel better.&nbsp; She has a masters degree.&nbsp; Can you believe you need a master's to teach Kindergarten?&nbsp; Collin also starts soccer practice this week.&nbsp; That ought to be great fun for him.&nbsp;  Please keep writing us!&nbsp; I feel like I'm just floating here.&nbsp; Of course it took me a year at Rochester to lose that feeling so I guess it's normal.&nbsp; My dad is one of the ministers here and so it's really odd to go from being a grown-up on my own terms to being just "Scott's daughter" or "Collin &amp; Leslie's Mom".&nbsp; I know this will fade as I find my own niche here, but it's a bit weird or now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Our new snail mail is  &nbsp;  Jason, Sandi, Collin &amp; Leslie King  100 S. Ridge Rd # 601  Wichita, KS 67209  &nbsp;  Email me if you want our new phone number!  &nbsp;  With joy,  Sandi&nbsp;&nbsp;

        urlLink    We are beginning to feel more at home here.&nbsp; We've begun meeting with a really neat group of people for LIFE group on Sunday night and that has helped a lot.&nbsp; Making new friends and going to the zoo and beginning to feel that things are normal again.&nbsp; It's good.&nbsp;       urlLink   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink     Collin is having a great time at school and learning so much.&nbsp; He can read simple words that have letters that they've done at Kindergarten and is so eager for more!&nbsp; It's fun and frightening to watch him discover the world around him in new and more perceptive ways, especially in light of the September 11 attacks.&nbsp; I kept both of the children away from the TV, but had to discuss it with Collin before he left for school.&nbsp; He is in afternoon Kindergarten and I knew that it would be talked about there and wanted him to hear it from me first.&nbsp; I thought I'd done a reasonably good job at informing him without scaring him until later that day when I found him hiding because he didn't want the bad people to see him.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; How do you explain terrorism to a five year old?&nbsp; I hate that I need to.   On that note, I'd like to share that while we have many friends in the NYC area, we didn't lose anyone that we know.&nbsp; However, all of them did.&nbsp; We are grateful to God for sparing them, particularly those who had close calls.      urlLink       Okay, back to good stuff&nbsp; Leslie and I go to story time at the library every Wednesday and urlLink   she loves it!&nbsp; I did a lot of this sort of thing with Collin before she was born, but haven't had the chance much with her.&nbsp; It's so much fun!&nbsp; Now that she's potty trained (hurray!) she's begging to go to preschool.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; She's only two.&nbsp; Maybe in January.     urlLink     &nbsp;Jason starts his new job on Monday as a scrub tech at Via Christi Health Systems.&nbsp; It's a steady job with good advancement&nbsp; he'll work over the next couple of years to get his R.N. and then he can move into hospital administration.&nbsp; We are very pleased for him to get this job, particularly as Wichita's economy is going to be among the hardest hit from the attacks.&nbsp; We are in the "Air Capital of the World" here.&nbsp; Boeing, Bombardier (Leer Jet), Cessna, and Raytheon are all based here and with all the layoffs coming, there won't be a job left even at McDonalds.   urlLink   Oh yeah!&nbsp; My best girl friend, Debi, had her baby on Sunday!&nbsp; Daniel Joseph Rutledge weighed in at 8lbs, 13 oz and 21 inches!&nbsp; This much prayed for child is a welcome addition to our extended family!   urlLink     With joy,  Sandi     urlLink

      Well friends, another year has come and gone.&nbsp; We are amazed at how God continues to bless us.&nbsp; This has been a year full of ups and downs for us and we'd like to share them with you.   Collin  started the year in preschool. He absolutely loved it and finished in May.&nbsp; His class delighted us all at the closing program by acting out the classic kid's story, Caps for Sale.&nbsp; His Uncle Jef and Aunt Lisa gave him this book for Christmas a couple of years ago and it is a family favorite.&nbsp; He started  urlLink Kindergarten  this fall is having a great time.&nbsp; His teacher says that he is a charmer and popular with the other children, although he sometimes allows socializing to get in the way of doing his work.&nbsp; He is looking forward to being on TV in January - he gets to say the menu of the day on one of the local morning news programs!     urlLink     Leslie  is potty trained, charming and is starting preschool in January.&nbsp; I have thoroughly enjoyed having her to myself when Collin is in school.&nbsp; She is starting to be a real chatter bug, which was surprising to us.&nbsp; I guess she never has a chance to get much in until Collin is gone!&nbsp; She is a very considerate child for the most part and we are looking forward to seeing what she becomes.    Jason  has a full year. He began a new job about this time last year for World Health Systems as an office manager and although he enjoyed his job there, he really missed being in the OR.&nbsp; Faced with a rent hike and high cost of living, we decided to move to Kansas where we could make ends meet with less stress and Jason could pursue his love of medicine.&nbsp; He is now enjoying his job in the operating room at  urlLink Via Christi  here in Wichita.&nbsp; Beginning in January, he'll be taking classes toward his nursing degree.   And I was blessed to have the opportunity to do a great deal of theatre last year!&nbsp; I designed and ran lights for  urlLink Rochester Church of Christ 's Christmas show and stage managed  urlLink Rochester College 's big show, Celebration in Song, in March.&nbsp; I also got to direct an incredibly talented group of actors in People Like Us, RCC's summer show in July.&nbsp; Now that we are in Kansas, I'm not sure what I'll be doing theatre-wise, but God always provides something.&nbsp; I'm eager to see what it will be!&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy my job as mom every day.   Our extended family has added 3 babies this year!&nbsp; We welcomed Kyra King, Mollie Grace McLeod, and  urlLink Daniel Rutledge  in 2001.&nbsp; We are delighted to see our family growing.   The future is looking rosy for us as we are considering being cottage parents at a local children's home,  urlLink Maude Carpenter .&nbsp; This looks like a marvelous opportunity for all four of us and we are praying for God's leadership as we begin to make this choice.   We hope the you have seen God moving in your life this year.  Blessings,&nbsp;  Sandi&nbsp;   urlLink

       Family News    April sees us all doing well.&nbsp; Kansas is beginning to green up a bit, although we desperately need rain.&nbsp; We have become a family on bicycles.&nbsp; Jason, Collin, Leslie and I all have bikes and we ride on the paths behind our neighborhood. Leslie has a seat on the back of my bike so that she can have fun too.&nbsp; She does have Collin's old bike and is learning to pedal, but she's not really proficient enough yet to go on long rides.&nbsp; It's great fun!   We continue to enjoy our one week a month at Maude Carpenter and are streamlining the moving process.&nbsp; They hope to have a new cottage open in September and we will move to being full-time cottage parents at that time.&nbsp; It is slated to be a girls cottage with room for up to 7 children (including our own).&nbsp; The boys in the cottage we work in as relief parents are good kids and they are definitely showing sighs of improvement in the structured environment.&nbsp; One of the boys won several metals at  urlLink LTC's  conference over Easter weekend.    Kiddos    Collin continues to do well in Kindergarten.&nbsp; He is reading some now and doing simple math, although his favorite class is P.E. (shocker, eh?) and he also love science.&nbsp; Leslie is still enjoying and starting to open up more at her preschool and is making friends there.&nbsp; Both are starting dance classes next week at the YMCA.&nbsp; They are beginning overview classes that include ballet, jazz and tap in a very no-pressure environment.&nbsp; Leslie has been twirling around the house non-stop since we all watched Singin' in the Rain and Collin is really excited about the tap section.&nbsp; We'll see how it goes!    Mom &amp; Dad    Jason has changed his schedule so that he only works weekends.&nbsp; He works Fri-Sun 2:30 - 12:00.&nbsp; This is a nice change for us as he's home all week (except for classes) and we really enjoy having him home.&nbsp; He gets to be more involved in the kid's lives by being available for parent-teacher conferences and such.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am continuing my job as family event planner and chauffeur.&nbsp; Over spring break, we enjoyed a quick trip to Topeka to see the historical museum and the state capitol.&nbsp; Collin has been studying Kansas history at school and so he suggested the trip.&nbsp; Boy, anytime your kids want to know more about history, jump on it!&nbsp; We had a great time traipsing about the capitol and seeing the senate and house chambers.&nbsp; One of the tour guide/guards really took a liking to Collin's friendly style and eager questions and I think we got a bit more than the normal tour from him.&nbsp; He makes friends wherever we go.&nbsp; It is a delight to watch.&nbsp;    Busy times    We enjoyed a trip to Salina to see our friend  urlLink Ryan Swearingen  in Titanic: The Musical in March.&nbsp; Our dear friends from Michigan, the Sandellas, are coming to visit us in May.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we are looking forward to a camping trip to Missouri in June.&nbsp; In NEVER thought I'd say this, but I want a minivan.&nbsp; I guess it's official: I've been assimilated.   We hope the Spring finds you all healthy, wealthy and wise.&nbsp; Thanks for stopping by.  Blessings, Sandi

      Greetings friends and family!   The year 2002 has brought many changes in our lives. So what else is new, eh?&nbsp; We are doing well and are constantly grateful for God’s blessings here in Wichita.&nbsp; Let’s see…   Leslie is going to preschool three days a week and loves it.&nbsp; On Friday we went to her Christmas program, which was an absolute delight.&nbsp; She’s a very independent little thing and insists on doing many things on her own.&nbsp; It’s like pulling teeth to get her to ask for help.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; My mother just laughs.&nbsp; She enjoys crafts – any kind of cutting or gluing will keep her content for hours – and playing with her baby dolls.&nbsp; Her favorite television shows are Madeline and Dora the Explorer.&nbsp; She can recognize many letters and form a few of them and enjoys “reading” (she mimics us or makes up the story).&nbsp; She’s been in gymnastics and in swimming this year and thoroughly enjoyed both.&nbsp; She’s very good at gymnastics. She’s extremely affectionate and fairly outgoing.&nbsp; Overall, she is becoming more fun to be with everyday.   Collin is learning to read.&nbsp; He’s actually pretty dogged good at it.&nbsp; He’s at the top of his class and reads at least one book to us almost everyday.&nbsp; He played baseball in the fall and most likely will again in the spring.&nbsp; Although he excels at reading and loves math, his favorite thing about school remains recess and P.E.&nbsp; He’s a very social child, and likes best to be around other children.&nbsp; A natural leader, he tends to be a bit bossy, but he’s beginning to make better choices in social settings.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was involved in a scuffle with another boy at school this week and has a broken collarbone.&nbsp; He has to wear a brace for three weeks, but it doesn’t hamper his movement too much.&nbsp; Now that we are over the initial pain, he’s doing very well.&nbsp; His favorite things to do are to play outside, or on the computer.&nbsp; His favorite TV shows are Batman (the original 1960’s one) and Rescue Heroes.&nbsp;&nbsp; His favorite toys are Legos and cars – he has a track that he can put together – anything building.&nbsp; He’s a very sweet boy – always trying to make others feel better – and he’s becoming the “class&nbsp; clown” in almost every group situation.   I am plugging along here at home.&nbsp; Which is actually a great deal of fun now that we have one.&nbsp; Oh! Did I forget to mention that?&nbsp; We moved into our new home at the end of August.&nbsp; I’ll talk about that in a minute!&nbsp; I have been doing some odd-jobs that relate to my theatre background this year.&nbsp; I’ve stage managed a few things and am doing a bit of event coordination.&nbsp; Central (our church) has begun a drama ministry that I’m spearheading and that has been a joy to be involved in.&nbsp; I’m also involved in some web design – check out our family page at  urlLink www.1stthings.net  - And I’m learning to play the guitar.&nbsp; So far, I can tune it! Hehehe. I’ll get there!&nbsp; My favorite TV show is Alias, which I watch with (via telephone) my friend Mitzi in Michigan every week, and Trading Spaces.&nbsp; Between the drama team, my odd jobs here and there, moving, and coordinating the schedule of three students, it’s been a busy year for Mom.   Jason just finished up his first semester of nursing school.&nbsp; Woo Hoo!&nbsp; One down, three to go.&nbsp; He goes to school during the day and works in the operating room at night, so it’s a challenge sometimes to find family time. But we’ve done fairly well so far and know that this is a necessary step for Jason to be where he wants to be professionally.&nbsp; He is involved with the Praise Team/chorus at church and really enjoys watching Enterprise and Trading Spaces on television when he gets some downtime.&nbsp; The term he uses to describe this semester is “survived.” He is currently enjoying a lengthy Christmas break (whew).   About our new house:&nbsp; it’s a delightful little 40’s ranch that had tons of potential.&nbsp; After removing miles of ugly wallpaper, rolls of green carpet, and a gazillion overgrown bushes and unhealthy trees, we are now sure that it is as charming as we had hoped it would be.&nbsp; The children have their own rooms and we have a great back yard for them to play in.&nbsp; It is right across the street from Collin’s elementary school and just three blocks from Leslie’s preschool. It has friendly neighbors and sidewalks for bike riding, roller-skating, and chalk art.&nbsp; We feel blessed every time we pull into the driveway.   So, that’s our year in a nutshell!&nbsp; We hope that you see God’s hand in your lives as well.&nbsp; We are constantly amazed at how much more he blesses us with than we ever ask for.   Our prayer for you is joy and peace to you throughout this season and the whole year.   Jason, Sandi, Collin &amp; Leslie King

      Leslie's graduation from Glen Park Christian Preschool  urlLink     ...with her big brother!  They had a very sweet little graduation ceremony and we had cake and punch afterwards.  Leslie spent 2 years of preschool there and loved every minute of it.  Kindergarten, here we come!

      You can't see it from the picture, but there are speckles of paint all over the entire mulched area. Sandi said later that the kids discovered speckling as a painting technique, and it ended up from one end to the other. I just gave them old brushes and disposable bowls and threw it all away when they were done. I think they may have spent just as much time planning exactly how they wanted to do it and just where every color would go before we ever left for Home Depot.

      We bought this great big wooden playset last year when a local private school was going out of business.  Last week, Jason took the kids to Home Depot and let them pick out pints of paint (from the return shelf) and they spent all day painting!  They had so much fun and are so proud of thier masterpiece!  And well...it looks...um...it looks like kids who have fun live here. :)  Painting the playset  urlLink

      Well, ok so maybe you haven't, but I've been waiting for over two long years. &nbsp;   I've passed my state nursing boards!!!!!! Yippieeeeeee!!!!!!   &nbsp; Yup, at long last, I am now officially: Jason King, RN.&nbsp; Man, that sounds good!  &nbsp; As you may or may not know, I've also been hired on as a Graduate Nurse at a local hospital here, St Joseph. I started this past Monday the 12th. It's still part of the Via Christi system, but it is a completely different atmosphere. Much more laid back, easy going, and with a more humane attitude toward thier employees. I'm really liking it much better than St Francis.  &nbsp; Once I get my actual liscense in the mail in about a month, they'll move me into a regular Registered Nurse position. But for now, I'm enjoying my orientation, and we are  ALL  enjoying my new, regular daytime hours. What a difference that makes.

        Dag nab it. Look what I found               Kindergarten classes are provided for all children of kindergarten age in the Rochester School District. Michigan Statutes stipulate that before a child can enroll in kindergarten, he or she must be five (5) years old on or before December 1.       Each spring the district conducts a Kindergarten Registration to identify and enroll youngsters who will enter kindergarten in the fall. Informational evening meetings are held in the spring for parents. Newspapers will announce the dates.       It greatly assists the district’s planning efforts if all kindergarten students are identified in early spring. Parents should contact the Student Enrollment Office or plan to attend Kindergarten Registration if they have a child who meets the age requirements.   Pupils are assigned to either morning or afternoon sessions based upon geographical location. Sessions are three hours and five minutes. Daily attendance is stressed because kindergarten is an integral part of the total instructional program."       *grmbl* Leslie could have started last year if she were in Michigan. She was ready. We fought them in Kansas to let her to no avail. AND she's been in half a day preschool for 2 and a half years. I want to go back to work and only having half a day school for her complicates things substantially.

Jason has his Michigan nursing lisense (Hooray) and is in the process of contacting hospitals to set up interviews there on Aug 2-4 (Mon - Wed).   We are leaving here around 5 pm on Friday, July 30 and will drive like crazy people with a goal of arriving at Debi's late Saturday night.    I understand that VBS is Aug 1-5 so Debi's gonna get the kids signed up for that.
