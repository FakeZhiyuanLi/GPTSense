       Hellboy...the WRETCHED perspective   So Hellboy was ok.  It mos def had some pretty damn cool moments, but mostly just plodded along predictably and CGI-ed like a champ. The wait was insane; JD and Eric wanted to go right after work so I walked up to South St. for a couple drinks (even though I had told Keg-Leg earlier in the day that I wasn't gonna drink this week-HA! LIES!) and some pizza skins @ Pizzeria Uno.  I did laugh at some parts of the film, and some action scenes were kickass (anything with that scary guy Cronin in it was gold) but anti-climactic and a bit sophmoric--INDEED!!!!  Work went by really quick today and I managed to get to a definitive stopping point by the end of the day so that was at least a relief.  I of course have TOO much planned this week and will no doubt be worn out by Thursday.  Tomorrow me and Sausalito go to KILDARES to meet up with Ms. Irate and Mr. Cypher instead of our usual Monday Nite @ Friday's fare (due to my Hellboy screening).  Wed. is Gorman and Wink (what could be better than a shrink followed by house music??).  Luckily, Stefan Francois has this week off for the hockey league so I have a day to recover before the weekend.  Saturday is my babydoll's birthday and Sunday is the Phillies game (I'm so psyched! It better be bloody warm).  Our Saturday night plans have suddenly falled through so now I'm really not sure what we're doing besides dinner for JD.  I'm thinking I'll surprise him with D&B's afterwards or something...  My back is killing me, no doubt from stress.  I shouldn't be up this late (almost 1am) but I'm awake b/c of the movie.  It was just a surreal day.  It didn't even feel like I was at work...weird.  Moto Kittens will prolly be jumping off the walls from sleeping all day and nite!  +++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       Written 3.15.04 (The Ides of March)   When the red-head croaked “he’s dead,” I cried. like he had never died before. But then again— he hadn’t died…instead levitating in a limbo of white walls in a  NorthEast Philly hospital… a Temple that seldom people worship.  +++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++

      This weekend was insane.  Insane is a strong word...busy with random errors and drunkeness?  Yes, much better.  On Friday, I came home and took a shower before going out b/c it was hot as hell in work and I was rank.  I met up with Kell at her cousin's house, and then we drove over to Bock's and hung out @ the GRAVEL PIKE for a bit with him. When we returned home from the bar, Kell left to go over to Little John's, so me and Bock watched The CKY Trilogy Remix.  I got all kinds of shite from Bock when I asked for my record player back...but as a x-mas gift from my sis, I get total claim on that bad boy.  I came back to Philly around 1:15 and met up with Ry The Scot and Sausalito @ Silk City, got charged FULL COVER even though there was less than 45 minutes left.  I didn't get home until 3:30, JD was up but went to bed right as I came home.  He lost his keys but we found out the next day that Eric had them so its all good.  Oh and I got to see Bo which was toally stellar, even if she's quite the fatty these days...hehe.  Saturday I was EXTREMELY HUNG OVER even though I didn't get drunk the entire time, but was also consuming alcohol from about 9pm until 2am and that usually is enough reason for me to get nauseous and have my head pounding behind both my eyes like sledgehammers were being beat into my skull.  I was up early though, and by 3pm I had already made 2 trips out for fast food (once to Burger King, then once to McDonalds b/c they forgot Mike's sandwiches and I felt bad) and Kell came by.  Then Kell promptly realized she had forgotten her wallet.  So we made the entire trip back to RoFo and back to South Philly, making it back only 20 minutes before Dana and Neary came to pick us up for the "PLEASURE PARTY" we went to, a sex toy demonstration @ this AMAZING BLOODY house in South Philly.  It was pretty entertaining, followed by drinks @ MANNY BROWN's and calls to various people/text messages to various people.  Kell left at 9am and I was up early again with a headache, but this one went away in an hour luckily.  JD woke up and wanted to get to the grocery store which luckily energized me enough to clean the house today.  I still have the bathroom to finish, but I'm waiting till later to get that done.  I just made food but finished half and now I'm full.  I dropped off my prescriptions today...but couldn't get either filled.  arrrr!  ++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++

      Oh how I wanted to write this morning...words were coming a mile a minute but the creative urge was lost on countless bookings and plant releases.  After talking to my mom, who is trying to adopt my little "sister" (niece to the legal system), I was ready to write a novel about the trouble she is having with the biological parents (one of my older sister's and some random redneck).  But now...nothing.  Its all gone.  Work exhausts to the point of THE NEED to do absolutely nothing.  I'm such a slacker.  I answered and email and I feel like I did something useful.  I got that look of disapproval from Lefty tonite when I made another attempt to get out of writing my column for this month.  I feel like I'm disappointing my father when he does that.  Its just me and my insecure delusions.  I wish I was stronger (I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller...)  So Mr. Joves got tickets to a sneak preview of HELLBOY.  So my plans next week have gone all topsy turvy.  I was supposed to go to KILDARES on monday with Mr. Cypher and Ms. Irate, along with Sausalito and possibly Keg-Leg.  But alas, I have to see if we can move it to Tuesday.  Wednesday is WINK.  And that is all that matters. ;-)  If its at 65 degrees outside I will be even happier.  ++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++

      Back again, not even ten minutes was it?  I don't know...just bored, or afraid to move.  One of the two is definite.  I'm upset I can't download music anymore.  I tried to sign onto one of those legal sites and ended up getting charged twice some astronomical amount, thus overdrafting my account.  Luckily, I got the bank to refund me the overdraft charge and eventually the site said I'll get a refund in 8-10 days.  Too late losers; you f**ked (can I curse? hehe) up my whole spending week!  I've been bad the past 2 days at work.  I've been going over to THE VEGAS just to get away.  Sure, its prolly nice that I'm out of the office, but that also means, I'm sitting @ a bar drinking and smoking my entire lunch hour.  Not drinking like a fish, just having a drink and pretending like I'm done for the day.  I used to like my job so much.  It scares me that its only really been about a year and a half and I'm starting to freak out.  I've become more fragile to the job rather than tougher.  How the hell does that happen???  I was supposed to be writing my monthly article for my web site tonite, but I just don't feel creative.  I feel tired, worn through, tread upon, achy, and tense.  The typing of this stupid entry is making my hands hurt.  Too much like the motions I perform over and over again in work with machine-like precision.  Except a really clumsy, silly machine that is efficient but doesn't pay real attention to detail.  That would be me ::raises hand::  I missed talking to my mommy today.  I'm trying not to call her.  I feel like I depend on her for too much support.  And I'm quite sure she feels the same way.  Plus I just want to whine to her about my job.  Which is prolly why this site was created...in the end...for people to bitch about something.  ++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++

       So, I HATE WORK   Hate is a strong word...but I've actually made my jaw hurt from thinking about it too much.  I must now subconsciously grind my teeth even during the day now too; and what a great time to run out of TRANQS!!!!    Anyway, I don't know why this blog seemed like a good idea, except that I started writing in a journal again back in December after my man bought me one, but got bored with it really quickly.  I'm on the computer too much...maybe I'll be able to write something useful.  --Mary E. Brickthrower

       The Brand New Obsession   Depeche fucking Mode.  That's all I gotta say. I borrowed multiple CD's from LX today in work and 2 of them were DM.  And now I'm home, listening to a BEST OF from Lefty's collection.  Its soooooo good.  Like "what the fuck was I thinking only sorta liking them before???" good. So no email from MILLAR or JEMAS while I was at work--but Mr. Joves put up the second half of the article, including my plea to get in contact with either of them.  ::enjoys the silence::  I got me laundry done, filled up me tires, and pulled the books I"m taking with me to PITT.  Tomorrow I will shower, pack and get ready to RAWK!!!!  I am all achy and already getting tired.  I should just call it quits and go to bed but I long to stay awake and listen to this entire 2 disc album!!!!  I've got to have some goals you know?  +++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       Warren Ellis hooks it up!   So last nite I got this email--from Bill Jemas, former editor-in-chief of MARVEL.  Saying he had a fun time with me and JD on Saturday and he checked out the site and really dug it (guess he didn't check out my MARVEL-bashing in the WIZARD NOMS story!!).  So I try to reply, only to get a bloody delivery error.  This has been my plight all weekend--I signed up for MILLAR's message board and can't PM the bastard.  MARVEL's site offers no contact info.  And it seems that JEMAS can email me but I can't email him back?!?  What's a girl to do?  Why email WARREN ELLIS of course.  I explained to him my troubles and he forwarded the message to MILLAR.  B/c he's cool like that.  You just have to love the comic industry for the simple fact that the famous people are on a WAY more accessible level.  Its damn cool.  Now to get in touch with JEMAS and I'll be a happy girl.  We're going to put a plea on ze web site asking for them to get in touch with us...hope it works...  Ms. Irate came down to South ST. and hung out and it was cool.  We were @ Ze Pontiac for awhile but then just ended up going to my house and drinking and watching TV.  Hella fun though...  I have to burn DAFT PUNK for her and Mark which is becoming all my friend's new favorite band it seems. I have to start getting ready for the con tonight.  We leave tomorrow nite.  Moto is Slow-Moto right now from getting spayed.  Poor kitty kat.  I don't feel like doing a damn thing @ work today.  I'm just going home and doing laundry--I'll worry about the comic book/packing shite tomorrow.  We don't have to go get Kell until 7pm so I'll have time after work.  Nothing like waiting till the last minute!! The animator for HOME MOVIES is gonna be @ Pitt Con so I will mos def be trying to score a McGirk sketch from him.  I also need to get a GEORGE ROMERO autograph for J to the Rizzock.  Other than that its just some random stuff, an interview with ANDY LEE (if he'll grant me one) and working for KOOP.  I've heard its a less crowded show so I'm anxious to see the set up.  Maybe this time I'll remember to bring my camera...as I totally forgot last weekend and have no record (except for JD"s pics) or our night out.  ++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++

       When I wrote this: 4.26.04-2AM Riki and Ms. Irate's Birthday  The orange and white bottles call to me across this beigne and neutral room from an ancient drawer. We might have to guess @ the number of bottles, the colors of pills The Co-pay vs. Generic A Pink one for the cold A white square for "the move" A white oval for the pain A yellow circle for the every day life that I'm too fragile to live w/o help (and all those supplements are not enough--I still rely on other things) {To KEEP ME HI!!!!} When does cliche become cool?

       I have been Her Kind...   I’m at work and bored as hell.  Either the EDI send system is down, or no one is making any bookings.  And since I have a minion to do my dirty work for me, I’m sitting here trying to look busy.  Typing an email always helps (which is what it looks like I’m doing; actually just gonna copy and paste this bad boy into the blogger window when I’m done).  Anyway, Moto was dropped off today for her spaying.  Then they called to let me know she has tapeworms or ringworms or some gross thing that I’m really upset about b/c she hasn’t been in contact with any other animals or been outside.  So how ze fuck she got it, I don’t know.  The price of this medical shite for her is more than was expected this pay—I have to see if I can set up a payment plan with them.  I’m really hoping I can or else I’m screwed for the next week or so.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY MS. IRATE and ZERO!!!!  Tonight we’re going to FRIDAYS to celebrate J to the Rizzock’s b-day.  I’m only having one drink and buying Jaime one shot. BUDGET BABY BUDGET!!! It should be fun though.  Lefty Joves and Keg-Leg will be reprezentin the pirate crew!!! Yarrrr!    I just feel out of it today.  Its all cloudy and I got in late.  I feel like I’m starting to get the haze.  The Haze is my pre-cursor to a nice little crash that means depression for me.  I tend to cycle and hanging with MILLAR and that stuff was mos def a HIGH point.  So now tis time to hit rock bottom.  This of course is only a prediction; if I had any way of knowing who/what caused my cycling then I would surely be able to help myself better.  Or maybe I do but just choose not to recognize any sort of power b/c in the back of my mind: I love being insane and scarred with these fucked-up things.  It makes me feel real.  *In Other News* +Donna seems a little down today but I am not at my top game when it comes to being a nice person so I’m just keeping quiet.   +Stefan bought DISCOVERY on vinyl. And I paid for my DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP on vinyl so hopefully I will be receiving that bad boy soon. +tried to email both BILL JEMAS and MILLAR but have had no luck either finding contact addy’s—or getting CORRECT addresses when I do find them.  SUCK!  ++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++

       I drank with Mark Millar!!!   Oh yes, tis true mateys.  I have NEVER read any MILLAR in my entire comic book reading career, but he has become a fave of mine in the comics world. And oh yeah, I sat next to Bill Jemas--and thought he was a really cool guy. Basically it went like this:  DYNAMIC FORCES put together a fan fest which involved some comic greats.  The after-con get together was auctioned off the little people and JD won me and him a spot in the little contrived soiree.  It started out just like any high school dance would--the cool kids and the "fan boys that won the auction"...but as the night wore on and Ze Brickthrower started drinking HEINIKEN, the conversation just got better and better.  And finally MILLAR and MACLAUGHLIN planned a little revolt involving heading to another bar down the street.  With 2 of the other 4 winners, QUESADA (and his wife?), JEMAS, MILLAR and the JD/Brickthrower collective hung out and drank with these comic book big wigs.  It was insane!!!!  Was I starstruck? Beyond words?  Did I help my once arch-rival change his cell phone personal greeting to "DC STILL SUCKS," you bet I did!  MILLAR totally impressed me with his story-telling and the promise of one free drink per correct question answered in "ULTIMATES QUIZ 2004," an epic battle pitted against me and MILLAR set for WIZARD WORLD CHICAGO this August.  Having a Scottish accent always helps men...MILLAR knows this and exploits it. JEMAS--questioned me about my poetry and promised to email me (probability--slim to none--I'm expecting nothing with the hopes to be presently surprised). The show itself was a little dull--first time show so there were obvious kinks.  Multiple rooms being one.  Me not talking to CHAYKIN enough was another.  A long day that was greatly rewarding at the end... I got some decent stuff signed.  I also had MICHAEL AVON OEMING say happy birthday to Ms. Irate on my cell phone.  It was much to much of a day.  And only a small portion of my friends will have any idea or even care. On another note--I got Ms. Irate's prezzie for her birthday tomorrow and spent more time wrapping it then I did buying it.  I'm also still completely obsessed with the NEW WAVE CHANNEL on digi cable and hoping to get laid sometime soon. JACK DANIELS--my new favorite drink. JD + Diet DP=Heaven!  ++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++

      Sometimes the fumes reside in the back of the throat chemical air in the mouth but you continue to drink...with the ease of a saint finish that last gulp before the next case of nostalgia hits you.  The desire to say "I'm done" is always with you done with him done with yourself done with this world done with this godforsaken guilt and need  Done with it all.

       So ZE BUDGET 2004 Begins...   Hmmm...well I am mailing a check to me mum for my NEW CAR FUND!!! So thats something. And paying every single bill I can!  My back is killing me...I should take a tranq right about now.  To get that muscle relaxer kick going!  I guess its not really a kick...more like a slow lapse into unconciousness.  So tomorrow is an excursion into comic book geek-dom known as the DYNAMIC FORCES FAN FEST.  I guess dealers will be there?!?  Don't really know...just know I must find a way to steal some time away for some shopping (food and otherwise); plus we have to drop Eric off and then go back for the dinner we won with some of the creators.  My stalker (aka the inker for TRANSMETROPOLITAN, just my favoritest comic book EVER) Rodney Ramos will be there.  So that should make it a little more interesting.  I have Sausalito totally in love with DAFT PUNK--I love that!!!  They rock so much the whole world should bloody well know!  I'm listening to a song off DAFT CLUB now.  I should be getting my shite together for tomorrow.  But I just can't get into this like the WIZARD WORLD cons.  I have a couple things up here for people to sign but I'm just a procrastinating bastard.  Breakfast will be good tomorrow though--I'm so hungry right now!!!   So Little John is bailing on PITT. And me and JD had a fight about me friends--and me defending them when he puts them down.  A argument/discussion/debate we have quite a bit.  But not sure what I can do about it when we just can't see eye to eye on certain things.  Our communication styles mos def clash on some topics.  Makes it very difficult to explain meself.  I just wish he could realize that I don't have livelong connections with people like him.  I never could because of my moving situation.  The friends I've made in PA are the closest I've ever had.  Ugh...don't wanna talk about it anymore.  I am totally looking forward to the weather and the weekend though.  Just to relax and know that I'm hopefully starting a budget and a plan that will have me buying a new car and finding better ways to spend my money.  Security sounds like such an evil word to a wild child such as myself but nevertheless is still something I crave.  My mind is just a muddled mess of messiness. Yeah...how's that for words of wisdom from your friendly English Major???  Damn the Man--Save the Empire!   +++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++

       Madness comes, Madness goes  by some band off the NEW WAVE music channel on cable.  So Stefan is supposed to be coming over tonite to watch THE OFFICE with me.  An anglophile such as him will admire and truly appreciate the greatness that is THE OFFICE.  I've only seen 3 episodes and I'm in total love with this show.  I also made Stefan a salad that I now specialize in. I have no idea what to call it--but its basically: 1-radicchio, baby spinach and endive 2-Honey Dijion Dressing 3-roasted red peppers 4-bacon pieces (real bacon!) 5-mozzerella, parmasean and feta cheese it rocks the hizzouse.  JD says it smells so good but he hates salad so he won't eat it.  But Me Matey Sausalito wants to try one...and I'm just pysched that I have a food that I specialize in. I didn't completely hate my job today. I need to clean up this mess and find some CD's for tomorrow before my guest arrives!!! My desk is such a mess @ the moment--comix, CD's and bills. +++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++

       My Little China Girl, You Shouldn't Mess With Me   I'll give you television I'll give you eyes of blue...  I just finished burning CD's for Eric.  JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and JD's BOWIE collection.  Quite a nice mix of music for our young co-worker.  Tonight me and Stefan pretty much just drove around so we could hear JACQUES' FABRICLIVE 9 in its entirety.  That CD ends @ GOUGE AWAY from THE PIXIES.  It could end no other way...  So now I'm listening to BOWIE (obviously) and drinking (of course) and bored (well duh!).  Yesterday was excellent in that I saw J to the Rizzock and we just hung out and it was cool...and I got a ton of shite done cleaning and organizing-wise. And I was a half hour late for GORMAN but its all good and we made a budget for me ($60 a  week on entertainment--thats it.  I can't carry around my check card around with me.  And I'm sending my parents $150 a month.  And I'm going to get a new car ASAP.  Its just so good to have a plan.  And the hope that I can stick to it.  So my sister did some model pics.  She's looking damn hot!  I'm gonna put them in my "random friends and family album" @ this link  urlLink right here.   I hope the best for her.  One of us needs to get rich so we can help each other out (I have no doubt in my mind that anyone in my immediate family wouldn't take care of the rest of the fam)!!!!  I don't know why I have the energy to stay up and type and the will to be this happy.  I'm just happy its getting warm and I may actually start saving money and that maybe, just maybe, I can do this happy thing for awhile.  I don't know.  I had a dream my dad died 2 nights ago.  And I'm still thinking about it like all the time.  And I hate over-analyzing things like this but it totally freaks me out when I know JD gets visited by his grandmother in his dreams sometimes and its just insane.  Ugh...I'm totally going to stop talking about this.  JD is sick tonite.  I'm really hoping he'll feel better.  I just wish I could make it go away.  I'm so maternal it sickens me sometimes.  I'm supposed to be all like "fuck domesticity!!! I'm a woman of the 2000's" but I like taking care of my Babydoll when he's sick.  now I'm sounding so lame I'm gonna stop talking about this as well.  Everyone is hating their job right now.  I really do believe that.  We're just sucking and floundering and I hate when we suck!!!!  I'm off to look for JAILBREAK on vinyl...  ++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       The late night sway...   So its 3 in the morning.  No work tomorrow.  Came home and cried b/c I have to spend money fixing my god forsaken tire that now seems to have gotten a nice size hole in it.  Nice enough that I had to fill it up twice while I was out (once when I got to Stefan Francois' and once when on me way home).  Money I don't have.  Money i've spent on other dumb things that I was somehow able to rationalize with phrases in my head like "well, its a special occasion" or "I don't have as many bills next week so I should be fine."  Ugh--I disgust myself with my mindless self-indulgence.  I just reek of lack of willpower (the newest fragrance from Calvin Klein).  So tomorrow I have me shrink and then maybe bloodwork but first and foremost is getting my tire plugged up.  I'm also planning on visiting fellow shipmate, Ms. (p)Irate @ Ye Olde Comic Book Shoppe, and meeting up with Keg-Leg later on.  This will be my first day off in a long time.  Needless to say I'm ready for it!!!!  Tonite I went over to Leah and Rae's with Stefan.  I am once again letting stupid shite bother me that I shouldn't even worry about.  Even Stefan said that I shouldn't care.  The analyzing is about Stefan's new girl and whether or not she likes me.  Stefan is one of my closest friends, even its only been a year that we've really known each other.  And even that silly muppet-lookin' motherfucker said "don't worry about if someone likes you, worry about if  you like them.   God--its so true!  But I don't even think that way.  Attention Whore, aka Ms. Brickthrower needs to be noticed and loved by everyone.  Ugh...I see these traits in me; I can list them alphabetically and explain them in great detail.  Do I do a damn thing to change them? HELL NO!  Anyway, me and Stefan had a fun time.  Rae and Leah wanted to watch RW/RR INFERNO so that was cool; afterwards we walked back to me car but first stopped off @ 700 Club to have a nightcap and then I went on my not so merry way as my goddamn tire is making me feel like my entire day is ruined tomorrow.  I talked to Jake today.  He is dating this girl Lauren and he sounds SUPER into her and all I can think is "thank god."  I just want that goddamn asshole of a former best friend to get his act together and shite.  He told me his HEP count is still high but his liver and kidneys look ok, so they're waiting 6 months and testing again.  If his HEP count is still high they will need to do a liver biopsy.  But he was sounding in good spirits and like him old self.  That is always a good thing.  I was @ work till bloody 6.30pm trying to make sure things were ok for tomorrow.  Even with everyone back on the team, it still felt like hell.  Donna was stressed and I was just so out of it from the night before that I was able to keep my mind off it and just focus on the 6 million bookings I must've put in.  Just the non-stop endless cycle of bullshite is wearing on me and Donna both.  We're both people of order and organization.  Its hard to be organized when everything is changing around you, and people keep throwing obstacles in your way.  I can hear the morning birds chirping...I can't believe I stayed up this late.  I was talking with J to the Rizzock until about 10 mins ago.  I'm starting to get that ache.  The ache of those that need to sleep.

       She's Lost Control Again...   I just read every single post on Ms. Irate's journal.  I'm insane.  And bored...  Today is absolutely beautiful.  I want to go out but have no money to spend and am still in need of a shower and Keg-Leg to get her ass over here.  Today is N*E*R*D.  Pharrell in da hizzouse!!  We've got quite a mixed bag of a crew going tonite--so i'm expecting only CHAOS!  I still have comix to read...but really I should take a shower and decide what the fuck I'm gonna wear to this show.  As its absolutely gorgeous outside I'm thinking a skirt, nothing too fancy but all my shorts are lame.  I need to switch to a smaller purse.

       Notes on the crew of THE BELOVED SIDNEY  By Manchester Mary, Scourge of the Seven Seas (and captain)  Members of the crew:  1-Manchester Mary, Captain.   I was on the crew of the DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS for 10 years, working my way up through the ranks until I inherited a large sum of money from a secret benefactor and was able to purchase my own ship.  Scourge of Seven Seas is my nickname, as my name is known far and wide as one of the deadliest and ruthless females on the sea.   2-Lefty Joves, 2nd Mate/coxswain/personal bodyguard/personal concubine.   Lefty was first mate of the ship for quite a while, but his deteriorating vision has forced him to move down to 2nd Mate.  This "demotion" is only in name as he has stayed my companion and lover, and is known by all the crew as the muscle on the ship.  The position of 1st Mate in currently unoccupied but I am reviewing my shipmates for possible replacements.   3-Keg-Leg Kelley, lietenant/sailing master.   Keg-Leg was a member of DREAD PIRATE ROBERT's crew but was relieved of her duties from excessive drinking.  When I purchased the ship, I asked her to join my crew and we christened her "THE BELOVED SIDNEY" in memory of Keg-Leg's Rotty/German Shephard mix that perished in a firew.  It does not help that she lost her leg in a cannon malfunction and had a prosthetic fitted that can be most accurately described as a giant flask on her leg, where she carries ale or other spirits.  Although a long-time friend and fantastic navigator, Keg-Leg drinks constantly and has a bad habit of getting "three-sheets" and talking to lower-ranking shipmates about matters that do not concern them.  Most of the time she is harmless, but I wonder of her 3rd watch duty spent with newcomer Sausalito.    4-Jaci Red-Handed, plunderer.    My sister and loafer--her best talent is sleeping and her next best talent is pillaging and charming men out of their money.  She comes in handy when we haven't made a pillage in some days; we stop @ next port and send her and Sausalito out.  Works like a charm.  Red-Handed gets men to buy her drinks while she takes advantage of their drunkeness; Sausalito's pick-pocketing skills are unparalleled.   5-Sausalito, deck hand, Galley Slave  Sausalito recently joined the crew as a galley slave and deck hand.  He works hard and seems to be vieing for more duties or a possible promotion.  His eyes have been on the first mate position since Lefty's leave of the post.  Sausalito is also the one I know the least about...for the simple fact that he does not know that much about himself.  He is from France, his mother a widower.  What he knows of his father is ever more scarce; his mother met a pirate whose name we dare not speak when she was visiting the port town of LA HAVRE, and they conceived a child.  His mother, fearing that Sausalito would follow in his missing father's shoes, never told him anything about his father.  His only clue is his name (Sausalito is supposedly the area in which his father was from--a Spanish Pirate whose death is so mysterious and vile that we no longer speak his name for fear of THE CURSE), Sausalito Francois Grovier.  Although Sausalito did end up becoming a pirate--it seems his intentions are only to learn more about his father.  I have sworn the older mates to secrecy, I will not have my ship CURSED for the curiosity of this young man.  My biggest worry lies in Keg-Leg, who shares 3rd watch with Sausalito and that is her favorite time to take a few drinks from that leg of hers!    Old/New Members/Updates   Ry the Scot has taken to slacking and I have given Sausalito the task of asking him to leave our ship.  Not to worry, as Ms. Jaime (p)Irate is willing and able to take over on the ship.  It didn't help Ry that he didn't even remember joining the crew, as he was very drunk the night I employed him.  Subsequently, Sausalito has lost his ship credentials but I told him that he can take Ry's--that Scot is walking the plank!!!!! Yarrrr Matey!!!!  +++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       MARS BITCHES!   So last nite was hella fun and completely free, as promised.  I ended up meeting up with Stefan at his house.  We had to drive up to the NE, b/c I left my phone @ his hockey game (after me and Jackie had a 20 min. convo about losing phones--insane) and someone turned it in so I WAS VERY LUCKY.  Then we went to Rae and Leah's new place which is shaping up to be quite nice, although the stairs still scare the shite outta me.  Jackie and her brother's girlfriend Nicki came and picked us up (thus leaving my car in Northern Liberties) and we went to BAR NOIR.  BAR NOIR was stellar.  Music-wise it was pretty lame.  It started with some great 80's but slowly deteriorated to hip hop.  The walls were all painted with fake magazine ads, skulls and other interesting things.  Turns out Jackie painted them--very cool.  We had a lot of fun just getting trashed.  The crew took me home so then of course this morning I woke up late (9.30am), but had received money from Stefan for a cab, so took one over to my car and got to work half an hour late.  Bran was cool about it and paid me in full regardless.  Good Man!  JD, Neary and Dane met me in KOP and we ate and saw KILL BILL Vol. 2 which I totally loved.  It wasn't nearly as action-packed...but the story was so fun!  I really liked DARYL HANNAH's character in it, and GORDON LIU's Pei Mei was probably my favorite part of the film.  The entire scene was shot like a samurai film--absolutely classic.   Some of my favorite parts: the ending credits that show all the names that THE BRIDE killed being crossed out with the exception of ELLE (Hannah), who only gets a question mark/the 5 point exploding heart technique/Budd and his white trash spit can (JD had no idea what it was!!!)/the entire PEI WEI instructional scene--complete with crazy-fast extreme close ups and silly dialogue/contemplating who deserved to die more--BILL or THE BRIDE...    So yes, I've been wound up today.  I'm majorly depressed b/c I was all set to go out and visit my parents next weekend but JD just reminded me today that this upcoming weekend is the DYNAMIC FORCES fan show/dinner with comic creators.  As fun as it sounds--I really miss my fam and won't be able to go the week after either as we're going to PITT that weekend.  Needless to say I'm being a pathetic little baby b/c I wanted to see me mum and Shell and everyone.  I'm gonna start crying if I think about it anymore.  Ok, I'm gonna publish this bad boy and write a new post for my BELOVED SIDNEY news...  PS:Some closing thoughts: +Digi Cable's 80's station is beyond sappy, but they did play "rock me amadeus" +THE FLYERS won today against the devils, advancing them to the STANLEY CUP FINALS.  Kickass!! +Me and JD discussed the same fight we have over and over again and I think we understand each other better.  I'm going to try to not "fix" every situation I think is bothering him and just agree with him or let him vent.  He needs that--and I need to stop mothering everyone around me.  +++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       T-Minus 3.5 Hours   Work--Lunch--BORED.  I have INVISIBLE MONSTERS to read but really don't feel like it.  The rain and the lack of sun is making me so lethargic...argh.  I finally got my ZOLOFT prescription refilled so tonite I can take one when I get home and attempt to chill.  Maybe I'll clean or organize something instead of going on the internet and trying to find people to talk to.  Work is just boring today and I want to go home.  I have MASTERS to check after I get back from lunch (5 mins) and that always SUCKS!  But at least I'm not the one doing them anymore...  I need to think of something I can do tonite--cleaning the bathroom is mos def one.  I have to wash my hair as well.  Or I might go one more day with it up since its rainy anyway and my hair will like shite either way.  Yes--that's probably what I'll do.    I'm just rambling.    ++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       WILL SHE KILL BILL???   So as a pop-culture addict, tis blasphemy that I FINALLY saw KILL BILL this evening, with the onslaught of Volume 2 this Friday.  Took my bloody old time didn't I???  In a word--LOVED IT!  JD seems easily annoyed by animal noises. Moto's meowing doesn't make him nearly as crazy as bird noise, but it ranks a close second.  I like kitty meows--makes me feel like she's talking to me. ::loves her cat way TOO MUCH::  So anyway, the movie was just really fucking cool.  Like just smooth and slick, even as it was swiping scenes left and right from both American and Asian Cinema.  The anime re-telling of ISHII's origin was probably one of my favorite parts.  SONNY CHIBA rocked my socks off to.  He was the actual SAMURAI SWORD ADVISOR for the film!!!!  I was pulled in from the first moment that BLACK MAMBA uttered before being shot "the baby is yo-"; with the later scenes showing BILL as a man of some sort of code or morality (by not letting ELLE kill "THE BRIDE" in the hospital), even more questions are raised.  That's fucking talent.  I really hope to go see the second part now on Friday--I might've pulled all my hair out if I had seen it back when it actually came out!!!!  Why do I smell bread all of sudden? *(I haven't even taken my tranqs yet I swear!)  I have a post card I got out of THE DRUIDS KEEP (the official meetingplace of the crew of YE BELOVED SIDNEY) bathroom about a needle-trading program.  I'm gonna send it to Jacob.  To remind him of his stupidity...  +JD got me the other macfarlane ICHIRO figure today.  RAWK!!!!  +Stefan's championship game is THURS and now Keg Leg isn't sure she can go...suck +I need to buy a stick and pads for the floor hockey game--and I don't even know if I'm gonna be any good.  Argh... +I have next Tuesday off for blood work and GORMAN.  Its a day of medical locations for Manchesta' Mary +My column is up and I'm very happy with it.  Stefan said he liked it. +I'm aching, but hopefully the tranqs will start kicking in soon--my jaw is starting to hurt too +SYSTEM OF A DOWN rocks--you know a band rules when the B-side album kicks ass +I miss talking with Stefan like I used to.  Its just weird now. +the corners of my lips are so chapped and I just keep touching them +I got 2 new papercuts today +I need my ZOLOFT stat +FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK  ++++++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++

       Rain Rain, go away...Come again another day   Tis sloppy and rainy outside.  Usually I like this weather but I wanted to go out tonite and drink with me pirate pals but "areas of fog" and "dense rain" was keeping me in.  Plus I'm "saving" money...I really hope I can keep that up.  I just made my face bleed...again.  I am fucked up.  It smells like sausages, I think my roomie just got up and started cooking breakfast.  Now I'm hungry...damn the man--save the empire!!!  My column went up tonite  urlLink :what you should be:   Its very musical-themed, which is cool.  I've been finding a lot of music lately, which makes up for listening to JACQUES non-stop for a straight month.  Of course I'm listening to KEOKI again, but how could I not????  Now I want to go out.  I'm starting to bite my nails, as if there is anything left to bite.  Mommy told me Uncle John has liver cancer.  He has to start chemo.  I'm too fragile for things of this nature.  ugh... I just texted Keg Leg to see if she went out.  I'm sure she did...I'm torturing myself now.  Yes yes yes yes I am.  Work was ok today.  I got everything done that I needed to and Nicole once again only made a few mistakes but for the most part is picking up MASTERS quite well and is still able to help with other things.  Which is Rokken like Dokken b/c I can take a full lunch now. If I can just force meself to stop buying lunch.  So then nothing and nothing and nothing...  ++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       Things I did this weekend that I said I wouldn't do:  1--drank alcohol 2--smoked like a chimney  Thats really about it.  I did get all my bills paid and attempted to figure out how much I can spend for fun.  Which means a lot less going out and a lot more "concentrating on my writing," because that's what people do when they don't have money.  My article is going to be done and ready to go up for tomorrow.  Of course there's that whole EASTER thing that we're doing--JD is one stellar man b/c he's taking us (i.e., me, him, his mum and her man) to MAGGIANOS.  Yum.  Today also marks Ze Moto Kitty turning 6 months old-- MOTO HAS RISEN...   But the ciggies are almost gone and I won't be buying anymore.  I will be going out tomorrow but not drinking...so tis all good.  The record player is hooked up so JD has been treated to DEAD KENNEDYS, ROB ZOMBIE and NILSSON this morning.  The new CD/DVD player is hooked up to and its kicking some major ass...DAFT CLUB is in, making the house my own personal disco.  I didn't get home until 4 this morning.  I drove Ms. Irate home and we stayed up and watched SCARLET DIVA, then I made her watch the SPARKS video b/c it is insane.  We both have our obsessions.  Mine just come out more in my writing...as everyone will see when I write about my thesis on KEOKI's last 2 CD's and what they mean for electronic music as a whole.  God, I'm such a freak...  Ok, time to put the pedal to the metal and get some shite done before dinner.  ++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       Keoki-fied   I will have to admit @ some point that liking KEOKI is totally uncool.  A self-proclaimed "superstar DJ," he is conceited and part of that scene of DJ's I'd rather not get into.  But now having acquired KEOKI's newest (KILL THE DJ), I am liking him even more.  Even downloading a song by him that I've never heard.  KILL THE DJ is a mash-up, i.e., songs layered over each other, lyrics from Madonna over music from Duran Duran and shite like that.  There are some definite misses, but the hits far outweigh them.  The 80's music is EVERYWHERE on this CD, updating that synth-style for today's electro-youth.  So yes, KEOKI may be popular and en vogue and all that--but he creates some damn good mixes that are both great to dance to as well to understand.   end more KEOKI notes   So its 9 o'clock, warm again, and I'm feeling good.  Nicole is working out to be pretty good at picking up this stuff quick, and just the help she's giving me now is enough for me to catch up on other things.  I stayed late today but it was really just to tie up some loose ends so I won't have to deal with them tomorrow morning and can focus on helping her.  The stress is still there...but it has been alleviated 10-fold.  Wanted to go to a bar SOOOO BAD tonite.  But curbed the need with some fast food and a drive around the city.  I'm going to the Indy on Friday w/JD, we're gonna get Nicole and Kell to come out as well.  Should be a fun time.  I just have to maintain the note to self that drinking will do NOTHING except give me a headache the next day.  I'll prolly just get amped on some red bulls.  I have been writing down all the lil things I'm spending money on and hope to figure out my budget on Friday.  What I'll prolly do is tonight start filling out the finance sheet that Keg Leg got me and be ready to allot only so much to the entertainment fund by Friday.  I know I wanted to go out Saturday nite too, so I must plan well so I can hit FRIDAYS on Monday with ze comic shop crew.  Blah Blah Blah I can't believe I'm blogging about organizing.  I'm so uncool.  No one's online anymore when I am.  It used to be like a nightly ritual to come online and chat it up with the usual suspects.  Its a ghost town now--plus I'm outta the message board mindset right now.  I'd rather talk to myself than post on my regular hangouts.  Weird.  Actually, I'm an anti-social OCD phobic, so I guess it makes perfect sense.  Oh yes! I did apply to take part in the "100 poets day" or something like that @ Robin's Bookstore on the 18th.  So that might be cool.  They are still judging the contest that I entered and so I'm keeping those fingers crossed.  I really didn't hold back with what I submitted this time.  I think its time for action, not holding all my pretty poems and being stingy with what I expose and what I don't.  Its all or nothing.  More trouble with Larry and Jennifer and this ridiculous and scary claim that Larry has some parental right to my Shell-Bell.  It scares me so much but I'm trying to be strong and not think about it.  He doesn't have a leg to stand on. His selfishness is overshadowed only by the fact that HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO KNOW SHELLY.  That girl is the coolest thing since sliced bread and he is not good enough for her.  Argh...my mom is being steadfast though and refuses to stop the process.  This needs to be done.  Shelly is part of our family and we're gonna make it legal baby!!!  I'm so glad its Thursday already.  nuff said.  ++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       In Da Daft Club After Hours...   DAFT CLUB--Remixes from DISCOVERY--good stuff, though not as good as I'd hoped.  But mos def worth the bucks!  And JD bought another KEOKI cd...rad!  I just started my next column...we were supposed to see JERSEY GIRL tonite but there were no places in Joisey playing it later than 7:30pm.  SUCK!  Not that I think its going to be good, just wanna see myself (i'm so vain, I even think this blog is about me!).  But I am doing some complete randomness for my column this time.  I think it may work out really well or be too obscure for people...but either way...I have my mind set and so I will make it happen.  Things I want to talk about: 1--KEOKI 2--MICHEL GONDRY 3--HORROR POP's "miss takes" **and kurt, the band project, SPARKS**  I have notes for almost all these things its now just expanding and finessing.  My thoughts have been so scattered...it seems that this is the hardest place for me to focus my motivation.  But I shall prevail as writing and thinking about writing is FREE and I need FREE things to do. I started training Nicole today and she's catching on pretty quick.  Little details are gonna be the thing that kills her but it will be so nice to not have to worry about MASTERS anymore...::sigh::  +++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       SYSTEM OF A DOWN--Not just for breakfast anymore...   The Horrorpops--"Miss Takes" is my favoritest song right now.  Its how I feel sometimes.  I left it @ work though...like a dope.  Explain to me the reasoning behind being so vain while being so easy to compromise oneself for the sake of others??? I am a walking contradiction...  I'm sooooooooooo bored.  All I wanted to do was come home and browse ze internet since its been so long since I've had a cable modem.  But no one's online so I'm forced to entertain myself which I find hard to do when in this condition.  I got my financial planning packet from Keg Leg today...her and Johnny are @ FRIDAYS...and I'm here. How am I ever going to save money if I can't spend one measly evening alone?  Christ--I'm such a baby.  I think I may have secured Sausalito as a travelling companion for a trip to me parent's in 2 weeks.  Then the following week we head to the PITT CON.  I work the next 2 Saturdays @ Ye Olde Comic Book Shoppe so I can have off for the Con.  I really want to go to a few different bars this time in Harrisburg--and Stefan is the perfect companion for that--his easy going attitude relaxes me for such adventures.  I just hope he doesn't flake on me...he didn't give me a definite answer...only time will tell.  So tomorrow my job may actually start taking a turn for the better, as we are getting a new person on our team, someone to take the MASTERS off me (the information I have to prepare for US Customs).  I will have to start training her (I already know her through from her previous job, so at least I know she has some sort of grasp on it!) tomorrow, hoping to get her up to speed by next week.  It will be very weird, but I'm hoping it will take the strain off of me and allow me to actually like my job again.  Today wasn't horrendous though, and we were down one person.  I was able to get all my MASTERS done and stayed late only as a precaution for tomorrow.  My back is killing me, but I'm pretty sure that's my bad posture and not my stress.   Michel Gondry rants   the DIRECTORS LABEL series was created by Spike Jonze and is the neatest invention since ON DEMAND...seeing a plethora of my fave video's on one director's DVD in particular was reason for JD to purchase MICHEL GONDRY's collection for me.  GONDRY is America's current geek darling as the director of CHARLIE KAUFMAN's ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.  But even the design of GONDRY's video collection is cute and appealing on its own.  Set up as each song represented by a different colored pencil, you can choose to PLAY ALL, SHUFFLE, or play just select people's videos.  And musicians that have worked with GONDRY are both dramatic (BJORK) and uber-modern cool (THE WHITE STRIPES).  My favorite offering is DAFT PUNKS 'around the world' which features a simple choreographed dance number that is so syncopated and sychronized that it will make your head hurt thinking about it.  GONDRY is the king of visual manipulation--his CHEMICAL BROTHERS and KYLIE MINOGUE vid's prove that--but the beauty of GONDRY's work is the absolute effort and precision that seem to go in every song is displayed perfectly on the screen.  For $14, over 25 videos plus a short film and documetaries that I have yet to watch, this should be in your collection...like now!   end GONDRY notes

       KEOKICLASH notes   As of late, there has been a great debate between me, Stefan and Ry the Scot on the theme of DJ KEOKI’s KEOKICLASH.  I picked this up quite by accident, having stumbled upon it in BORDERS and saw that there was a remix of “Rippin Kittin” that I’d never heard before.  As soon as I told Stefan who the CD was mixed by—he was all like “WHAT???” b/c it seems that KEOKI was a raver DJ back in the day, and quite the drug fiend.  Ry thinks that KEOKI is totally rejecting his younger days of spinning and cashing in on the Electro movement.  I have listened to this CD extensively (it has not left my rotation since I got it a month ago) and the theme that comes across to me is far different than Ry’s cut and dry thesis.  KEOKI starts out his CD in full 90’s mode with a slightly queer rant.  The repeated line “I am legendary you are not” is not only topical for the “you better work” scene of the 90’s but almost crosses over into the “kittenz and the glitz” of Electro.  The next 2 songs focus on the drug scene and its bad effects, Miss Kittin says in her monotone accent “sex drugs and rock and roll…its over.”  PBD (permanent brain damage) is also addressed.  The negativity towards drugs may seem like KEOKI is denying his past experiences but I really think addressing them and showing that he has moved beyond them is displayed more.  The song that really rams his idea home is the voice over which says matter-of-factly “that? That was the “Rave Revolution” of the youth, sort of like a mockery of rave reality…they thought it was all about smiles and sweetness, flowers and candy,  but there is something bitter to taste.  And to think that there isn’t is foolish”  I think KEOKI is trying to say that he has realized the darkness can be in the music, not in the drug use and pill popping.  Electro has that dark and dirty edge that maintains the confidence of its predecessors without the blatant drug culture connection.  I have to believe that KEOKI has embraced a new type of music while paying homage to his roots.  It’s a journey of sorts illustrated through music.   end of notes   In other news, I’m feeling about 1000 times better than I did last week.  The jaw tension is gone, most likely from the tranq-popping.  Getting a full night’s sleep no doubt helps—I didn’t even hear Ze Moto Kitty meowing @ the door last nite.  THAT, my friends, is a good night’s sleep!!! I’m done drinking…for awhile.  I need to save money.  I want to buy a car by next year.  Plus we have about a zillion conventions we’re attending and I would like to have money to spend without charging anything.  I realize that I have debt and maybe sort of always will, but I’m not charging anymore.  I took the credit cards outta my wallet—hopefully that will help.    +++++++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++

       Shattered Glass...and Red Candles   It is 11pm, really 10pm but because of the arcane tradition of daylight savings time we are forced to think it is an hour ahead than it really is.  JD is in the other room having a particularly loud tourettes episode (me and eric have concurred that JD much have a non-vulgar form of tourettes).  Moto is crawling all over desk and hardware--but really I came on hear to talk about SHATTERED GLASS.  Do not believe that Hayden Christiensen is a bad actor b/c of his bloody wooden turn in THE ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  I am a original STAR WARS nut, so much fo the point that I have a tattoo, but believe me when I say that GEORGE LUCAS has compleletly ruined one of the greatest sci-fi epics of all time.  Bastard.  Anyway, SHATTERED GLASS is both restrained yet overwhelmingly desperate.  CHRISTENSEN plays real-life fabricator Stephen Glass with a pathetic quiet that rips at your heart and forces the back of the throat to dry with uneasiness.  As far as the female characters--they are disposable and even more restrained in their personalization.  The two main female roles (CHLOE SEVIGNY and some other girl that was in COYOTE UGLY) are easily silenced by their male counterparts.  The real gems come in the aforementioed CHRISTENSEN and supporting actors PETER SAARSGARD and HANK AZARIA who both play editors to Glass.  SAARSGARD is the most heart-wrenching portrayal, as a new editor seeking approval and the need to show his loyalty to his writers.  But when Glass' story about a hacking convention is exposed, SAARSGARD's character must throw away all he hopes to gain to show the truth where Glass has created fiction.   ***end of notes for my next WHAT YOU SHOULD BE***   THE DESERT SESSIONS--featuring the likes of JOSH HOMME, TWIGGY RAMIREZ and the lover-ly PJ HARVEY is spellbinding!  So much fun and just a great little rock record.  "Miss Takes" by HORRORPOPS is NO DOUBT delicious...the hook is easily memorized and made for repeated playings.  JD is way more into the other bands put on a specially made CD for me by Ms. Irate, indeed, a CD of what she wants her band to sound like.  A band that I will hope to join greatly, ready to fight tooth and nail to get something going with the likes of J to the Rizzock, Elisha and Lil John.  Not quite rockabilly, garage rock, lo fi pop fuzziness is how I would describe it.  If that makes even one bit of sense.  So my sorta friends (I call them sorta b/c they are really Stefan and Ry The Scot's friends--but every once in awhile I get to hang with them) Wayne (BRITISH!!!  ACCENT!!!) and Beth just moved into their newly built house in NORTHERN LIBERTIES, the uber arty area of Philly that has Ze Brickthrower's name written all over it.  The house is bloody gorgeous...I spent a few hours drinking wine and enjoying the fresh surroundings.  Today was such a bust...we were supposed to see the Phillies game but the weather was such shite that we ended up going there, getting our free food, walking the entire length of the park and leaving.  We didn't even stay to see if the game was called.  The wet and the cold was enough for us.  I have to work at Ze Comic Shop the next 2 Saturdays so I can have off for the Pitt Con.  On top of that, I'm already set to obsess about next week for this week, as my co-worker is taking the week off, the very same week that my other co-worker leaves for another job.  Joy.  I'll be poppin' tranqs like candy hoping that I don't bash my own head in with my keyboard.  I had to stay late on Friday and managed to get my 4th straight week of overtime.  I'm also starting a budget which will either finally come together or fail miserably like so many other things I've tried.    I want to go see the 'rents in 2 weeks.  And I want to get Kell or Stefan to come out with me.  Its much more fun when I have someone along to veg with.  Plus I would like to go to Harrisburg and see the cool clubs that my sister doesn't work at.  Nothing against her--I wish she could come out too.  But her bar is like HIGH SCHOOL DANCE V.5.0  Ugh.  I need a cigarette.  And some proper motivation.  And the will to go outside...  +++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       A Short Story Amongst Friends...#2   ****READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!  PEOPLE GOT A LIL RAUNCHY THIS TIME****   JUDY DOES C-VILLE By Ze Brickthrower!, Keg Leg, Jen, Little John, A-Licia and E-lisha on 5.30.04   When Judy was a child, her mother would lock the door behing her every night, after kissing little Judy's ruby cheek and say "Under no circumstances must you leave this room, Judy dear." Her mother would beat poor little Judy with her huge black dildo.  Judy referred to it as the "Black Dong of Satan." When her mother beat her, she would cry, but mostly from the stale putrid stench of Mommy Snatch that radiated from the Dong of Doom. One night, Judy decided to retaliate. She formed an elaborate plan to steal the dildo and throw it out the window into the pool. But something went terribly wrong.  As she picked up the Black Dong of Satan to dispose of  the wretched  evil that plagued her since birth, she caught a whiff of her mother's evil snatch.   "That smell, that horribly perfect smell" she thought to herself.  How could she part with it?  As she thought naughty thoughts of anal sex, the dildo magically turned itself on [sic] and flew into her young anal crevice.  It pounded in and out until finally it spoke! "Oh my precious young and oh-so-tight Judy, there is only one way to keep me as a magical dildo!"  He told her as he rammed into her harder and faster.   "What is it?" Judy moaned. "Anything, I'll do anything!"  The dildo told Judy that the only thing to keep him from turning into the Black Dong of Stat was to sneak into her mother's room while she was sleeping and tape dryer sheets to her snatch every night for the next week. Then...Hi...:) I have A.d.d. and aren't good at writing stories...I like Dildos and the on in this story excites me... Yup--I need some ritalin cuase A.D.D. just kicked in...may the Black Dildo of Satan rise in the East and fall in my ass FOREVER!!!  Dilos Rock!! -FIN-  There's always one of them, isn't there? +++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++

       A short story amongst friends...    SYBIL AND THE SALT written by Mary, Stefan, Ry the Scot and Rae on 5.27.04   Once upon a time, there was a girl Sybil. Everyday she would travel to railroad tracks to put pennies on the rail.  And everyday the Conducter would shoot Sybil with the salt gun.  She would pick up the rock salt, take it hame, and make pretzels.   Sybil would ask all of her friends to come over and pose in weird positions in which she would then copy the shapes into pretsels.  Sybil decided one day that she would take them to the train conductor to make peace.  The train conductor took them willingly and so the cycle continued of pennies, salt, pretzels and peace.  This happened over 3 years, which some referred to as the "3 Years Peace Before the Storm." One day, instead of the conductor taking her pretzels of peace...he threw them on the groud and said:  "No More Sybil! You have broken my heart!"  The conductor, a fat man with mustard stains on his traditional cap; was remembering events of the past.  Events with Sybil that  happened when she was only a little chile.  Children are innocent! But Sybil was not.  In fact she was the ANTI-CHRIST! and Sybil" dawned her fangs and tore the conductor's throat out.  With warm blood coarsing through her preternatural veins, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a roll of pennies to finish what she had come to do. "Death is your judgement--but not your punishment!" Sybil said with eyes blazing with red light.  Quickly she exposed the roll of pennies and shoved them in his mouth. "You, the Fathers of Lies, will know the meaning of 'loss of innocence' you evil Motherfucker!!!!"   Out went the passengers, leaving Sybil and the conductor alone. The passengers were an odd bunch all rejects from a Nike sweatshop in Taiwan that fed them through funnels of made sandpaper.  Thought time the all developed a rare throat disease called Scratcheothroatitus.  The sweared death on Nike and its entire corporation.  Traveling to America, the caught the train, the final leg on their trip to the headquarters. NEW YORK CITY JUNE 1st, 2004: NIKE HEADQUARTERS Vice asshole Frankie Fairview, sitting at his desk while a little blond girl enters with a roll of pennies and attacks! Bludgeoning the VP to death with a 3-inch phallic object.  Before this Sybil had figured out what her fate woudl be.  The workers would have come for her if she had sought them out.  They weren't supposed to be a part of this--it was between her and the conductor.  So it goes. And so, with Sybil's last breath--knowing her fate as a murderer and instigator for crimes unseen--Sybil unleashed all she could upon the Corporate Headquarters.  Using her skill she learned from The Father of Lies, she breathed fire with the devil, and brimstone with Lucifer himself.  There was nothing left of that city block when she was done.  Not a terroist act, but an act upon all that opposed the proleteriat.   "Viva La Resistance!" was her gutteral cry as she burst into flames. A Phoenix that would never rise again.

       Twas Brillig, and The Slithy Toves, Did Gyre and Gimble in the wabe...   Last night I wrote my best interview/story I have ever done.  I can't wait to finish editing it and get it on the site.   Probably not till next week, but after what Andy Lee said about it, I'm even more excited:   Your report was soooo sweet!  I am teary eyed.  You REALLY KNOW ME  MARRRRRY!!!   ::Blush::  Tonight I'm going to hang out with Stefan, whom I miss dearly.  We might be going to play Quizzo with Ry The Scot and Rae so that should be kickass!  I may have to miss THE OFFICE, ::sigh:: but I'll try to live.  Been conversing quite frequently with Philip.  He is one smashing chap!  And he loves REAL GENIUS too.  That automatically bumps him up on the point list.  Yes, I have a friends point list.  If you're reading this entry, you just got yourself 20 extra points.  I'm @ work.  And now I must return to the working part of said work.

       W.W.J(cubed).D.?????   That's my new motto.  What would the 3 J's do?  Shacky, J to the Rizzock and Bock.  My new conscience.  If you're not listening to SPARKS yet, for the love of christ download their songs with FAITH NO MORE. I'll burn them for you--just email me!!!   GOLDIE   GOLDIE is this Brit that spins Drum and Bass like a God.  He's the DJ with a heart of gold...and the grill to match!  There is something so bloody tribal about dancing to drum and bass.  I can easily describe the other clubs I go to:  FLUID--WED--HOUSE--Big Fish, Little Fish, Cardboard Box (thanks Matthew!) NOCTURNE @ SHAMPOO/THE DARK CORNER @ ULANAS--WED/SAT--GOTH-INDUSTRIAL--The Industrial Stomp! TRANSIT--TUES--DRUM'N'BASS--SPAZZES on CRACK!  I took a couple shots of Ze Pirate's Rum (you know, for confidence) and came out of there completely sober.  And it was only an hour and a half later~!  I'm talking sweat EVERYWHERE.  I'm talking non-stop movement that comes only in 2 speeds: Fast and Faster.  There are the break dancers, the people that dance just to every other beat, and the complete fanatics like me that just need to hit every goddamn BPM with the same intensity as the last.  "THE QUICKNESS. FURTHER INSIDE." Alicia, Angie and Steph were there.  So was Stace but I didn't see her.  I only had money for one drink once I paid the cover but it really didn't matter.   What mattered was ringing out every last drop of energy, last drop of OCD, last drop of everything is gone and expended in exhaustion and salty sweat on that dance floor.  Its 2:30 in the morning and I just want to hear some MORE.  PEACHES is taking me down to that special place: He's not dead He's gonna live I see his eyes rollin' back in his head.  I want to watch FIGHT CLUB and pretend I'm Marla Singer.  And after that I want to pop a tranq and call it a night. I started reading TITUS ANDRONICUS.  Fucking Brilliant.  +++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK   Fuck No. 1 is for Stefan who says he misses me but hasn't seen me in 2 bloody weeks.  Fuck No. 2 is for me being so afraid to do anything alone that I'm sitting here @ this computer instead of getting ready to go  Fuck No. 3 is for GOLDIE who is spinning tonight @ TRANSIT  Fuck No. 4 is for wishing for things that WILL NEVER BLOODY HAPPEN.    WHERE THE FUCK IS THE OFF SWITCH FOR MY HEAD?????  Nicole added me to her site.  Fuckin' Awesome.  Now go visit her!  ------->  urlLink CLICK HERE!!!   She's engaged and her ring is exactly what I want! (for all you possibly suitors out there...hehe). I finished THE REVIEW.  I put THE REVIEW in caps because it was absolute hell trying to write it.  I stopped doing book reports in high school because my brain doesn't think that way.  That's why I like doing my column; because I can just rave about the color of Donnie Darko's shirt if I wanted to.  No rules, just right.  Just like OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE. I've been running a text message poll the past half hour to see if I should go out or not. Ms. Irate, Bock, and Shacky Red-Handed said Yes.  Andeelee said no.  BAM might be there...god why am I still sitting her contemplating??? If I write a really bitter post about going out tonight, then I'm blaming it all on them.  However, if I have a good time and meet BAM, then THANKS FOR THE GOOD ADVICE GUYS!!!  +++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       I'm obsessed   Her jaw hurts, you can see the tension in her tendons held tight, stretched over skin more taut than a drum head. And in her mind, she repeats her own indiscretions, because now there is no one to blame but herself.  The pain from wanting everything from everyone. Knowing that her need needs to stop but either letting the id beat the superego down or just no way to NOT LET it overcome.  People can push her, but more likely they will coddle and wipe her tears away. They don't even realize the trap they have fallen into. I would try to apologize for her...but its useless.  Because with all the excuses--the pills--the pain--the knowledge of what has happened and what will come to be. With all of this--she will do it again...and again...and again  ++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

I spent most of my night in the bathroom of the swanky LOEWS, drinking ze Pirate Rum and smoking ciggies with ANDEELEE.  Joe got TOE UP.  :( The one sucky thing about the night...he left VERY early from sickness.  Its ANDEELEE's fault...he was passing around shots like they were going out of style.

I have off tomorrow, so I'm going to KOP to hang with Ms. Irate this evening.  I can't pass up the chance to chill when I get to sleep in on a Friday.  Its like heaven.  Work Sucks...and then you die.  Really my plans this weekend are just to rock out and enjoy the scenery.  It should be hella fun.  Harrassment of Zeke and Andy Lee will commence tomorrow @ 1300 hours.  Did I mention that me and JD had a huge fight yesterday and I finally admitting to reading his email while he was in VEGAS last year?  Oh I didn't tell you?

       It took a girl like me...to bring me to your knees  I stayed out WAY too late last nite.  But its like, Kell's been sick, and we can&#8217;t chill @ her house really.&nbsp; Stefan is MIA b/c he's like totally in LURVE with his new girlfriend and has totally admitted to ditching me and Ry. So J to the Rizzock is cool as all hell to chill with, she likes to drink and watch fucked up shite. And since I went back to Ze Comic Shop specifically to work with her and Lou, and I never actually work with either of them, its gotta be chillin with some scotch and ginger ale @ Ms. Irate's flat till 2AM or however long I stayed. So needless to say I'm tired today.  I need a shower.  I have a half hour left of work and absolutely nothing to do. I'm still depressed.  And when I say depressed, I mean psycho.  I'm not happy with my friends, I'm not happy with my relationship.  I feel like me and JD are simply coexisting in the same space together and I hate it. Its so generic right now. I love him so much and I just feel this ambivalence cast over us and everything around us. We're busy:  the site, work, trip planning, etc. I'm doing that whole "remember when we first start going out?" thing in my head. Stefan being all gay about him relationship doesn't help with me wanting to examine my own.  I am starting to wonder why I work a second job but know if I quit I'll just be bored again on Saturdays like I always was.  MILLAR emailed me again today for my address; JEEMY hasn't emailed me; ANDY LEE is mos def gonna be in Philly. I'm trying to get Ms. Irate to come hang out with ze crew on Friday.&nbsp; We shall see...Keg Leg needs to get her ass down here as well. She's been sick. We both think we have the HENRY THE IV.The HI-FIVE. THE NINJA. Hehehehe;god I miss O&A!!! But seriously this cold/allergy thing is just lame.  I've started playing TEKKEN 4 again. Unlocked all the characters yesterday before I left for JRock's house. Hopefully I can get some TEKKEN FORCE play in tonight.&nbsp; That is if I don't pass out from exhaustion and/or general malaise. +++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++

       An Email Fight Amongst Friends:    Email#1 To Some of My Friends  Subject: These Puppies Need a Home! A customer @ my place of employment is selling some puppies.  They are rotty/boxer mix.  Attached are some pics and some more info about them. If you're interested please let me know!  Thanks!  Mary E. Note: forwarded message attached.   Braver at Night:  APATHETIC ICON PRESS ©2004   Want to know more? http://www.simplyjd.com   How the Wretched Live--An experiment in self-indulgence: http://howthewretchedlive.blogspot.com/ -----Original Message----- From: Susan.Shook@Mineralstech.com [mailto:Susan.Shook@Mineralstech.com]  Sent: Thursday, May 13, 2004 3:52 PM To: Mary Nied Subject: Puppy pictures - 4 weeks old  Girl, by the box the other two are boys . The one in the front is available to a good home.  We are asking $200 this includes cropping the tail, first shots and worming.  Puppies are scheduled to have their shots June 3rd.  The mom is a boxer rottweiler mix and the dad is full blood rottweiler Brown and white, dominant boxer.  The big brown dog in picture number 2 is the sister to the mom of these puppies. As you can see the mom is laid back she lets her sister and her mother close to these puppies.   Susan Shook   Email #2 LX's Reply:  Hey, thanks for the offer but I'm not sure why you forwarded this on to me as:  A)  I have four cats.  B)  Why would I pay $200 dollars to mutilate the poor thing when I could just run it's tail over with my car?  By the way, are you getting a cut of the tail-chopping profits for advertising for these ethically-challenged fascists?  Thanks, dear, but no thanks.  LX   Email #3 My Reply to LX:  LX: I'm not sure if you realize but your emails (particularly this one) can oftentimes come off as extremely harsh and condescending. That being said,  1.I'm getting no "cut".   2.The tails were already "chopped" off before I even knew about the pups.  3.I DID know you had 4 cats, but thought that if I forwarded this to people that I knew that have pets/close friends/like animals, then maybe someone would know someone that would be interested. 4.I'll be sure remember to NOT email you next time with my inbox-clogging spam.  Thanks dear, Mary    Email #4 LX's 2nd Reply:  Oftentimes?  This was the only one meant to be harsh at all, and even then I was half joking.  I did not think that you were actually getting a cut.  However, I do strongly feel that animal breeding and surgical aesthetic alteration is sick and wrong.  According to PETA, animals should not be "owned" at all.  Further, demanding money for creatures when so many others are available free from the SPCA and pounds is insane.  I also disapprove of the ownership of naturally violent dogs like rottweilers just so that people can look tough and cool.  So, now that I think about it, I do take issue with the whole scenario and I try not to associate with people who think that paying for an animal and to have it butchered because Dog Lover's Magazine told them to is a great idea.  I am sorry I have offended you.  I don't mean to sound condescending.  I do value your friendship.  But I still don't want any chopped-up doggies.    Email #5 Ze Brickthrower's Rebuttal:  There's a way to state your case or disapproval for something without adding sarcasm (driving a dog's tail over with your car) or condescension (thanks dear, but no thanks). I value your friendship too.  I just felt I was being dealt with in a harsh manner over a subject that clearly was not my intent.  I love you LX.  Nothing will ever change that. :-)  Mary E.   Email #6 LX and I love each other Again:  I love you, Darling.  Honestly, ironically, I added the 'dear' to take the edge off.  It obviously backfired.  I can totally see how you could read it otherwise.  There's a Kids in the Hall skit about a guy who has a speech impediment that makes him sound sarcastic...  ++++++++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++++

       I am going to destroy the world.   So yesterday I went up to bed about an hour early just so I would have time for a hysterical cry.  Oh it was just wonderful!!!!  Not really.  Neither was TROY.  It sucked.  Too long; cinematography bordered on soap opera bad; ORLANDO BLOOM just seemed quite lame...ugh.   Work was cool though--me and Jaime worked till 4 then went to FRIDAYS and drank.  I'm going to her flat on Monday to watch horror movies.  Other than that I'm feeling dreadfully alone and isolated.  I have my period, my allergies are attempting to kill me and inhabit my body, and I just want to be outside but I haven't seen Stefan for about a million years outside of work and he's the only one in this godforsaken city that would go anywhere with me.

I'm still in work but Donna just left so its time to start getting ready for me and Kell's "Piratecore 2004" @ me house.

JD is putting it up tomorrow and then hopefully more people will be visiting this little piece of the web that I call My Blog.    My head hurts from sinuses; it doesn't help that I keep sucking the snot back up my nose b/c I didn't bring kleenex and when I try to blow my nose nothing comes out anyway!

       Rockin' Toronto Hardcore!!!   Yes, Ze trip is booked, we're going to TORONTO for the con June 18th-20th.  Whirlwind trip yes; but it shall be well worth it!  Free hotel, free passes to the con, and other perks that I can't even begin to describe.  If Ms. Irate makes it out it'll be even fucking cooler.  Can't bloody wait!  So I stayed home from work yesterday due to illness.  I'm still sick but starting to get better...although I'm a plethora of mucus and sweat (from getting a fever and breaking a fever every couple of hours yesterday).  I need a shower, and I need it to go back down to the 70's because this weather is complete shite!!!  Tomorrow is resting time for Ze Brickthrower; Keg Leg will be coming down to rock out in Philly but we're just gonna stay in and drink ze Pirate Rum and watch TV or whatever.  I don't want to go out to the Indy and get all drunk especially while I'm recovering and even more expecially while I've got work the next day.  I'm working 2 Saturdays in a row so I can be off for the Philly Comic Con, which I'm uber excited about b/c ANDY LEE and ZEKE will be there and that is just kickass.

       Sickey McSickerson--that's Me!!!!   Yarr!! The Pirate Rum and my NEED to go out last night has made my throat even worse than yesterday.  I kept waking up this morning b/c my nose was all stuffed up and me throat was killing me.  I bought RICOLA lozenges but the scratchiness is so annoying I just want to rip out my trachea!!!    Last night was bloody awesome. There was a small social gathering @ J Rock's, including Mr. Cyphere, and Ze Punk Rock Twins (Nick and Alex).  We watched ICHI THE KILLER which was so overhyped in BIZARRE mag.  It just turned out to be this long and convoluted story that tried so hard to mean something @ the end.  Ugh--we were more like MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER the entire time--talking and heckling.  I have so much fun with Ms. Irate.  She is just a kickass gal.  And I stayed out WAY too late and I almost wish I didn't feel like shite or I would go out again b/c I was invited to watch HORROR movies and chill again @ The Irate One's but that would just be asking for myself to get sicker.  And if you think I'm whiny now...just wait till I lose my voice!  I'm not sure what I'm up to tonight...I may try to get Jaime to come down here...but I don't know if I'll be able to pull that off.  Of course I'm feeling like shite so maybe I should just say FUCK IT and stay in like a normal person.  Stefan is spinning tonight and I already told him I couldn't do it.  He's got Jackie now for moral support.  I dyed my hair--tis really really really red.  No, like REALLY red.  JEEMY emailed me again with his new email addy but still now word on what he has in store for me and www.simplyjd.com  Only time will tell.  ++++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++++

       Time to dye Ze Hair   I have roots hardcore.  I got some dye to last me until I can go and get my bangs done again--having 2-tone hair is bloody annoying.  I got a really freakin' bright red so it best turn out or someone shall be walking the plank!  Friday was dinner with Donna and the rest of our team from work.  That was fun and VERY filling.  On Saturday I worked till 4, then met up with Kell, Little John, Mr. Cyphere, Ms. Irate and Elisha @ Fridays.  Twas fun for the whole family.  I only stayed for an hour then had to get home so we could go see VAN HELSING which was such a stupid movie and complete waste of time.  And it was over 2 hours long!!! Who the fuck do they think they are?  Sunday was MOTHER'S DAY so me and JD took our mum's out to MORTONS STEAKHOUSE which was very nice and everything was super yummy!  My mum is planning a grand vacay to DISNEYWORLD in October--I'll be taking my vacation then to go and hang with the fam in FLORIDA.  Should be fun; of course I could never pass up the chance to go the Magic Kingdom, even if it is DISNEYWORLD which I usually despise...later that evening I watched the SURVIVOR finale with JD and then met up with Jackie and Stefan for a drink.  TORONTO is a go as well--we're getting our airplane tickets this week and will be planning our whirlwind trip there for June 18-20, the days of the TORONTO COMIC CON.  J to the Rizzock and her man Mark may even be joining us.  Its really hard to pass up when we've got the hotel and con passes hooked up through KOOP.  And the hit count for the site just keeps going up--all thanks to JD's convention coverage.  I sorta started my column last nite, DEPECHE MODE is of course getting mentioned.  I'm not really sure of what else is going up there yet but I must have it done by WED.  Tonite, I may go out, or I may stay in and try to get more done.  I will mos def be dying my hair.  I also have JD's first Barthco Softball game to attend--I can prolly get some writing done there.  Its a beautiful day.    I didn't bring in CD's today--listening to the radio can really suck out your will to live.  My throat hurts--not sure if I'm sick or its just allergies. And that is all for now.  +++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++++

       No Rest for The Wretched…   Goddamn.  That’s all I want to say at this time.  Me and JD have had a busy past 2 weeks and now WIZARD WORLD EAST is fast approaching and I have 3 pieces to write for the site and haven’t even started on one.  Monday was spent scanning pics and sketches for JD.  Yesterday was a good evening, where I went and watched the FLYERS win in overtime over @ Stefan’s house with Keg Leg.  I came home and scanned a sketch I missed the previous evening and burned a copy of the CD I bought for me daddy for his birthday for myself (I’m evil, I know; I’m also trying to save money!).  Tonight I am going to ze shrink and then over to Ms. Irate’s for a little CINCO DE MAYO celebration!!! Or, maybe just watching Mark play video games and drinking a lil.  Whatever—tis all the same to me.  I was thisclose to cancelling my shrink appt. just because I have neither the money nor the problems at the moment to really talk about anything.  But Gorman is going back to Germany for 3 weeks so I figured I’d better get that one last meeting in before she leaves and I mentally collapse.  During the morning yesterday I had an hour or 2 long email convo with MARK MILLAR about CHI-TOWN and PETER MILLIGAN.  It was awesome.  ANDY LEE also emailed me, as did ZEKE, both promising to see me in PHILLY.  ZEKE is all for hanging out with us on the Sat. of WWE2K4—and I’m forcing ANDY to hang with me and KEG LEG.  His email is worthy of showing off right here:   Mary!  So great to hang with you this weekend.  Your smile is infectious,  J.D. is the pimp and you are the sexiest pirate on this flat planet.   Isn’t he just the bestest??? Haha…its so like this vibe that he just gives off that makes him so damn cool.  I’m completely unintelligible and I’m not even drunk.  ZEN—Andy makes me feel ZEN—that’s exactly what it is.  It’s a harmless semi-celebrity crush.  Me and JD were talking about making the interview 2 parts since we’ll be seeing him again in a couple weeks, and focusing more on the “person” side of him.  We’ve noticed that even WIZARD, the biggest comix news’ mag on the planet, is basically just a big advertisement for comix.  Not about the creators—or the cons—or the culture that comes along with comix.  To exploit this HUGE HOLE in the business is our goal and mission.   Our “main objective” as BRANDON DICAMILLO would say.  I was even thinking to bring our site into a more technological level, we could actually videotape the MILLAR/ULTIMATES QUIZ @ WW Chi-Town.  That way we would have a sound and video record of the account—as well as being able to post small MPEG snippets on the site.  I think it would be a great thing.  But when I im’ed JD about the idea last nite he didn’t seem to keen.  We’ve got time to plan and scheme and discuss.  Supposedly MILLAR was mailing me comix today…can’t bloody wait!  Something I’m being forced to wait for: DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP on vinyl.  The motherfucker that I won the auction from is SOOO MIA its not even funny.  I tried emailing him and the email came back to me.  The PO Box is being checked everyday.  What a bloody punk! The pic of me with CAPT. JACK SPARROW is up on me picture site.  More to come.   Oh yeah, walked past the REAL WORLD house last nite.  Its fucking awesome!!!  They have a red Christmas tree in one of the windows which is just damn cool.  You can walk right past the house—and see inside the house which looks all hip and shite like EVERY OTHER real world house.  Stefan wants to create a ruckus one morning to wake the cast up.  What a geek.  +++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       More about the geek's weekend   ANDY LEE is the coolest guy ever.  Although ZEKE, JML's point man, is quite cool as well.  Both don't make you feel like a freak for hanging about.  I shared a drink with ZEKE and he said he will mos def be hanging @ Ze Indy during WWE2K4.  Andy and I drank the pirate's rum and he drew this cute lil sketch of me!  He lives in Atlanta or I might start stalking him like I'm doing with BILL JEMAS.  MILLAR hasn't emailed me since FRIDAY...I'm such a geek that this makes me sad.  The interview with ANDY was awesome.  I wasn't nervous at all like I was with JML.  Me and Andy shared a chair when I was interviewing him which was just neat.  I asked him about his handlebar moustache and painting a mural in our bedroom.  And Captain Jack Sparrow was there--or at least an uber-fan that dressed up EXACTLY like him.  It was awesome.    DAVID MACK is insane--and thats why you just have to dig him.  He's hot as hell--which always helps!  Really, I did a lot of sleeping and whining about my tummy.  I also did a lot of drinking and smoking. I didn't do a whole lot of CON stuff (i.e., standing in line, getting sketches). Creator-wise, it really wasn't a con for me.  But that doesn't mean that I didn't have a stellar time.  I did.  It was kickass.  I have to get back to work...ugh.   +++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++

       PART ONE--the outlining of a geek's weekend:    God I have about 5 million stories I can tell about this weekend.  Let me break it down in terms of themes, or subjects if you will: 1--THE DRIVE:  Driving there was quick and virtually painless.  On the way back I started freaking out over the torrential downpour and it seemed to take FOREVER, I guess because of the rain. 2--THE HOTEL:  Nice!  KOOP hooked us up...we were right next door to him and being in the same hotel as most of the talent was kickass. 3--THE CON:  Overall, not very many creators on me must-meet list.  I had my site on 2 in particular (which I'll talk about later), but for the most part I slept THRU the con itself and woke up for the after-hours fun 4--PITT--I only visited SOUTHSIDE, but it has the same vibe as SOUTH STREET w/o all the pretentiousness.  I mos def had a fun time @ Keg Leg's bar THE SMILING MOOSE.  I only spent an hour or 2 there b/c my tummy was acting up the whole weekend so I came back to the lobby bar and met some people while waiting for JD.  ***break for SIX FEET UNDER RERUN***

       "Playing Musical Instruments"   So this week I went from playing bass to rhythm guitar to keyboards/synth.  And you know what? I'm actually bloody excited about it.  I have some sort of confidence on the old piano--and damn if me mum won't be happy that those 5 years of lessons paid off (finally!).    Oh yes, I know.  We're one split personality disorder of a band.  But I really trust and genuinely like the people I'm playing with, and I think both of them are really intelligent people.  And I lurve it and suck it up with a bendy straw each time I'm with them.  Its just amusing to me how much we have clicked so far and how much strife HANDIWAX went through.  That was a soap opera waiting to happen (CALIFORNIA DREAMS aside).  Anyway, I subsequently showed Bill Jemas some of my work and was criticized for my non-sensical-ness, which I totally agree with.  As I replied in an email about this very subject:   Anyway, don't you see now why I write poetry???  I have all this shite in my head that is just screaming to get out, but developing into ideas and non-convoluted ones at that is extremely difficult to me.  I can write a research paper every day of the week but ask me to use my organizational skills in my creative work and I go brain dead.   So it goes.  And suffice it to say I've written 2 new things this week, don't really think they're poems...just a blend of words that might end up as poems someday.  But one is really pretty so I'm going to scan it next...stay tuned.  The other one is way to weird for me to even post here right now.  But its about my life right now, and I think that says a HELLA lot.  Just watched CASTLE IN THE SKY tonight and it was really good.  Also watched LOST HIGHWAY (soundtrack is in now--fucking great CD) on Sunday or Monday and need to write about it now for me next column.  JD is having a crazy Mary weekend in the burbs.  We're going Saturday for a trip to ZERNS followed by a little get together for someone special's b-day.  Should be a very fun time!!!  Me and Keg to Da Leg will be hanging all weekend which always guarantees rawkus and rage.  My own personal R&R.  So now I must scan pictures, post on message boards and play around with my key-tar that LX is loaning me, which is totally 80's rokken like dokken!  Oi! can't forget that I mailed pics to THE LEE as well as called ALEX AVELINO to see if he's been getting my emails (yes I am that crazy).  EBOLA SYNDROME--SUCKED! MY NAIL BITING--OBSESSIVE  ***Andy Lee just called!!!!***  +++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       Pitch Shifter...   So I just want to say here that I was talking about the wrong Alex in my writings/pictures.  ALEX AVELINO was the very cool, pirate rum loving friend on Sunday @ ze con.  Sorry for the screw up here; I feel like a jerk.  He hasn't emailed me back and I'm afraid its b/c I'm the lamer than can't get last names straight.  2 Alex's!!! Right next to each other!!! What are the odds???  Anyway, we're going to try to have me start playing rhythm guitar in the band and have LX start singing and playing bass.  Its an interesting concept...and I'm willing to try anything.  But we have made it understood that if it's not meshing with me then we can change it around.  I don't know.  I'm in complete and total love with me bass...but I also really like this group of people so far.  So if ANDEELEE or someone will drive me, I'm going to crash the next TORONTO show and cover it all by my lonesome!!! Its so bloody exciting to think about doing a story completely on my own that will involve new info and coverage rather than me writing about the shite that I like.  And it will be the final con before my September deadline of the C.C.C. (self imposed deadline; I'm working on getting a good editor/research partner to help me with my proposal for one of the bigger sites).  Anyone that wants to do a 4-day weekend with me please email me!!!!  I made a collage of my leftover photos from TORONTO so I can look @ them all the time.  I just wanted to make something.  Its fun.  I wish it wasn't SUNDAY afternoon.  I need to talk to Stefan tomorrow and hope that we can get everything straightened out. Such a long and pointless story. Koop stayed over this weekend for the one day show and I got to work with Jaime.  I hung out with her, Mr. Cyphere, Keg Leg and Rae as well.  It was an interesting night indeed.  6 FEET UNDER tonight...hip hip hooray!  I'm working on something of an original poem but its borderline lame.  So we shall see.  ++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       You think its sleazy/To put it in the short leather   I used to hate THE WHITE STRIPES.  I thought they were completely overrated.  AND NO BASSIST??? Fucking Blasphemy I tell you!   Well, JACK WHITE is the man.  Nuff said.  His pencil thin moustache in "THE HARDEST BUTTON TO BUTTON" vid (Gondry directed-rock!) is enough to make my heart go aflutter.  Yes yes.  So KEOKI is spinning tonight and I won't be there.  I'm such a loser.  I should suck it up and go anyway but I'm getting sick and I'd like to stop it before it starts (yeah right....I'm already drinking).  So instead I practiced bass for a bit, and now plan on writing while watching JUON b/c I'm obsessed.    Nothing much is going on.  I have to work tomorrow, and then I'm meeting up with Mike and Keg Leg for a private party @ EMERALD CITY (where I should be going tonight!) for Carlin's graduation.  Band practice on Sunday.  I shouldn't have gone out last night, then I'd be ready to kick ass for KEOKI.  WHINE WHINE WHINE.  Ok, time to finish up this poem which I have no idea what its about.  +++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++++

       Made the Choice to Go Insane   NIN is the official soundtrack of my life.  Oh yes, sceaming about the pain of EVERYTHING is something I do best.    and I'm always in pain.  Trying to write without using the word "I" is like impossible.  I am everywhere.  Its my fucking life.  What's wrong with ME? I?  Why does that make me "young and inexperienced"?  I have been in love I have broken hearts and had my heart broken I have a functional dysfunctional family I have had an ex-lover almost die on my twice I have to take pills to keep from comitting suicide  Doesn't this make me know enough to know that I should just shut the fuck up right now and stop being so self-loathing?  Um...guess not.  I pulled out all the usual writing gear today: the pencil box, the folder of writing, the new notebook.  And I just looked at it and wanted to scream. I went over to Stefan and Ry's to watch BATTLE ROYALE and it was like we were all strangers again.  I can't believe how alone I can be with people around me all the time.  We barely talked.  I don't want to ask about his girl b/c I don't know what to say.  He was my friend goddammit!  I care about him so much but its all gone.  We're never gonna get that back.  "Mary, I don't understand why you just can't decide to be happy, and then be happy."     Nothing...seems to kill me...no matter how hard I try Nothing is closing my eyes...for your pain or your delight   I need to stop this tomfoolery before my heart explodes from the emo-ness of it all.  ++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++

       Toronto Con Coverage--theWRETCHED style   Let's recap...shall we? So airports totally suck now.  I would seriously prefer to drive to SDC next year instead of flying.  I know we were going to another country and all but it was fucking gay.  DAS FUHRER BUSH has made it annoying as all hell. We didn't make it to TORONTO until 1-ish.  So sleep was pretty much the only thing going on in my head.  I arose to JD's alarm Saturday morning and thought I would sleep longer but ended up waiting for the boyz (that would be JD and E-Mart) to get ze fuck outta the room so I could get ready.  I made a complete impulse purchase of a OCC pink/black trucker hat at the PHL airport so I decided to pair that with my grey/pink shimmery skirt, jeans, and me miss kitty arm warmers.  And off I went in search of the pirate rum and the coolest places in Toronto.  The answer to both?  QUEEN ST/KENSINGTON MARKET/CHINATOWN.  Oh yeah...con coverage.  I got to the con around 1-ish (afternoon this time) and said my hellos to KOOP and STUART SAYGER.  ANDEELEE was far away so I got something signed by CARY NORD and added him to the potential list of C.C.C.'s then E-Mart suggested we go shopping.  HELLZ YEAH! We got a cab back to QUEEN St. and I bought: BATTLE ROYALE 2 Disc DVD JUON THE GRUDGE DVD LOST HIGHWAY FISCHERSPOONER-"EMERGE" single that I didn't have A CUBAN CIGAR  I went into a ton of record shops looking for AC/DC and DURAN DURAN night versions of songs but came up empty handed.  Me and E-Mart had a hella fun time just cruising the strip.  We stopped a QUEEN SO-AND-SO's pub and had us a drink and some garlic bread, then headed back to the hotel.  And so I waited...for the coming of THE LEE.  ANDY and his pal ALLAN arrived fashionably late, prolly close to 8.  We got a ride over to VINNIE'S, where the con party was being held and I talked with ALLAN, CARY NORD, smoked me cuban and just enjoyed the scenery.  There were alot of names there but I just was so happy to be hanging with THE LEE that I just chilled in one spot (outside--b/c you can't bloody smoke INSIDE!).  E-Mart left us to get his groove on at a bar around the corner and that's when Ze Brickthrower, ANDELEE, and ALLAN took our leave of JD, KOOP and crew for some fun of our own.    Oh yes, my kittlings, I had a mission.  I had to find JEREMIAH BULLFROGS, where J ROCK and MARK got engaged.  And yes, I had been drinking, as we all had.  So I got a little turned around, but was able to show A&A most of QUEEN ST., b/c its like SOUTH STREET but one hundred times better.  We finally made it to JEREMIAH's, and then headed to the HORSESHOE for last call for alcohol, followed by more walking, then heading back to ANDEELEE's hotel for some guitar playing, talking and random shite.    Mr. Lee has lost his interior artist work for SAM AND TWITCH.  So I'm making a FUCK TODD MCFARLANE sign right away.  I was thoroughly reemed out by JD the next day for not coming back to the hotel and being a big idiot.  Which I totally deserved.  B/c I was a bitch.  But anyway, it was SUNDAY @ the con, and all was well.  I ended up meeting my favorite TORONTO native, ALEXANDER AVELINO, who was hella cool, looks like USHER, and gave me the best. sticker. ever. (haha...I shall never tell~!).  ALEX is an animator but is also a friendly guy who sculpts like a mofo and a style sense much like a guy named STUART SAYGER that I know.  ANDELEE had been missed; you could tell by the people coming by and saying hello, asking how the drive was (everyone seemed to know that he was driving up for HOTLANTA for one day).  Oh yes, and I met RVD and he was a fucking cool guy.  He asked about the comic shop and said he would try to check it out next time he was out that way.  JD bought the pic with ROB VAN DAM for me, as well as an X-STATIX epilogue that inker CLARK put together.  I will not read until the last issue comes out!!!!  JD's con coverage will no doubt be better! I will post a link when its up (he has WAY more pics too~!)  +++++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++++

       Toronto: Beware of Ze Brickthrower!   Tonight tonight tonight tonight we leave for TORONTO.  I'm sooooo bloody excited!!!! All packed, just need to remember to buy a disposable camera so I can actually get pictures of the insanity that will ensue.  What has been going on? I cancelled with GORMAN, against my better judgement, instead to hang with the crew (J Rock, Keg Leg, E-Mart, E-Lisha and Little John) and watch JUON THE GRUDGE again.  YES!!!! I really haven't done much this week except random emails and what not.  JEEMY called me @ work! And discussed my Andeelee story and other things.  He wants to see more of my writing.  And I want to be famous.  So it goes.  I'm bringing exactly one comic to get signed and the rest of my money will be spent on paintings by Andeelee, drinks (PIRATE RUM TOO!!!), and Asian Cinema.  Awww...can't wait!!!!!  Keg Leg got some insurance money so she can finally start replacing some of the stuff from the fire.  Good for her.  I told her Captain's Orders are to have fun this weekend and text me when fun things happen.  The same goes for me. Oi! We have a court date for the adoption of Iron Belly Shelly.  July 15th.  Can't wait to see if that fuckyer Larry actually shows up.  +++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++

They will be mine in Toronto.  Just you fucking watch.  My stomach hates me again.  I remember a few years back when anything I ate made me want to vomit.  Its back again.  Do I keep trying to feed my body the poison or just starve myself and hope for the best?    Tomorrow I'm rocking out with Keg Leg @ her humble temporary abode.  I worry for my gal all the time.  She's the shite and she needs to be happy.  And if I can't do it--one of you better make her smile.  Or else skulls will be cracked and heads will roll.  Its only 20 after 11pm.  I need some music.

       Things to do in Toronto when You're Dead...   I still need to put together my Master List of C.C.C. (cute comic creators) for Stuart and his g/f to peruse.  I need to decide what I"m going to wear.  I need to cross my fingers and pray to the gods of Pirate-dom that Sir Andeelee actually makes it to Canada.  I have to finish my WHAT YOU SHOULD BE... by tonight.  My business cards were delivered but no one was bloody home to get them.  I'm going to have them redelivered to work here tomorrow.  I just used a template off some site but I totally dig it.  I'll actually have my own cards to hand out in Toronto!  Practice with DA BAND went pretty well for the first time.  I think that everyone is laid back and yet creative enough to do something stellar.  And LX can sing which is always a plus after Joe's screeching in HANDIWAX.  We were supposed to meet a perspective drummer though yesterday but his "truck kinda blew up."  Ugh...this is going to be the hardest part, no doubt.  Shacky is getting me a pirate flag in VIRGINIA BEACH.  Yarr! I can't wait to see it!!!  I didn't really post about my weekend--but basically I had a kickass time rockin out @ the TRAPPE YMCA with Little Johnny's band.  I saw Jamil who went to TEMPLE with me, and hung with Krissy's lil sis named HELENA who was this 10 year old girl who was just Rokken Like Dokken!  Hehe...I skanked like I was 16 again. It was insanity.  Then we went and chilled @ J Rock's.  I crashed @ Ms. Irate's because I was lazy and didn't want to go home.  I can't really think of anything else that is interesting.  I'm ready to take a trip to TORONTO and comic book geek-dom.  ++++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       Its early...   Not even 8am yet and I'm already up.  ON A SATURDAY!!!  I set the alarm wrong or else I'd still be in dream land.  I have to work @ Ye Olde Comic Book Shoppe today...and then me and KEG TO THE LEG are getting together for some random mayhem.  We have a couple ideas, nothing planned for sure yet: 1-Little Johnny's 2-Carlin's race (I forget what kinna race) 3-Mike, my new bandmate, is having friends over for some PS2 competition   **speaking of the band, I didn't get to practice the lines as much as I wanted, but I keep telling people how lame it is to practice basslines for yourself...**  Anyway, I'm hoping to run around and do something fun.  Cross your fingers for me. I played hooky yesterday from work and just sat around, cleaned random things, watched ROTK, and talked about the scariest movie ever, JU-ON. J to the Rizzock had me and Stefan come over on Thursday and watch it.  Creepy as all hell. I have no money. I suck. Andelee emailed Keg Leg.  Rock!  ++++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++

       They Make the Rounds @ the Midnight Hour And on the clock its just a minute away...   Konichiwa Bitches! JD went out to see HARRY POTTER 3 so I was left home to fend for myself.  Mike came home and so I decided to the get the fuck outta dodge and head to south street for some random fun.  I ended up @ the Pontiac Grill, where I sat, drank TULLEMORE DEW and COKE, read URB and wrote my next column.  I now have 2 entries, with me thinking that DIE PUNY HUMANS is going to be my 3rd rant, followed by a short bonus of some sort.  KILL BILL is looking to be my biggest feature which is cool b/c I watched it for the 4th time today.  The film is bloody awesome.  My tummy hates me. I have been nauseous after every meal for the past week.  I feel like I'm going to vomit up my intestines.  I'm so hungry though too...strange.   Happy Birthday Louis!   I bought me mum's birthday prezzie and Daddy's Father's Day prezzie is next.  Toron-Con is next week and the dates are up on Andeelee's site.  How fucking great is that??? He is actually coming up!  Insane boy, but I'm so glad I get to see him and will have someone to pal around in Canada.  He's a kindred spirit--where JD makes base camp at one local bar, Andeelee is into exploring.  And that is the main reason that I am heading to the Great White North!  Hey hoser!  Say a little satanic prayer for Keg Leg in the hopes that she feels better after her teeth and ankle problems.  Thanks loveys.  I have successfully banged out 2 of the 3 basslines I'm trying to learn this week.  Mike, me new bandmate, sent me ze tab but I already had them pretty much completed.  I would like to add shite here and there, but right now I'm just concentrating on memorizing what I need to.  I'm so glad to be active in music again.  And with the nature of this band it seems that I'll have a lot more room for creative expression.  Which is good for when i'm not writing poetry or have writers block.   Some band name ideas: +PURE IS POOR (from Jeff Noon's VURT) +SENTIMENTAL FISTING (the lost NIN album?!?) +CECILY'S SIN +S.T.H. (STEP. TOWARDS. HELL.) +CORRELATED TEARS +GOTHCORE JUNKLIGHT (a combo of LX's and mine)   I'm getting very sleepy. And RENO 911 starts soon. Must watch and pass out.  +++++++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++

       Lou’s Birthday Story…by Mary, Kelley, Jaime, Nick and Paul…06.07.04   Lou was so happy!  It was his 30th Birthday and all the drunkards of the land had gathered at the local bar for some wine, women and song.  As always, the women came first with their juicy bungholes that glistened under the bright moon.  Their assholes were loose and easily penetrated.  Lou was ready for a night of adventure and anal pleasure.  He has ordered his first shipment of Vietnamese whores, when… Skeet, Skeet, the whores were hot and ready. But OI! Problem…bamboo shoots? Oh decisions, decisions.  So he went for it anyway. And then Bob came in to tell him this wasn’t what the Punisher would do, drowned out by the thoughts of Zombies and someone who said he looked like Tom Cruise.  Lou then decided to kill them.  They died a death most painful, full of screams and sucking [sic] chest wounds. Then suddenly, GOD appeared in the form of an Afghanistanian YMCA Bus Driver named Gus.  Gus said to Lou: “Lou, since you have made it this far in life and since you killed that pack of rabid Vietnamese anal sluts, You are my chosen prophet!”  So Lou’s first chuch, called “THE TEMPLE OF THE BLEEDING ULCER” was formed on the very spot of COMICS & MORE.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR. CYPHERE!!!!!

       Rock'n'Roll   Just a quick run down of shite I got going on:  +met with the band, got the demo, listened to it, totally digging it, start writing bass lines ASAP (and Mike's sending me tab just in case)  +Weekend at the rents was fun.  Saw HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and dug it.  Gary Oldman makes anything 20 times better.  Had Shell watch KILL BILL, which she totally dug.  I'm gonna make that kid the coolest 8th Grader ever!  She loves CKY and MONTY PYTHON as well.  She's also less than an inch shorter than me and she's only 12!!!  +Went to the Gravel Pike with Keg Leg and John yesterday...white trash bars are fun!!!  +Got to talk to Andy Lee this weekend, and he might be coming up to TORON-CON!!! He's got a show Friday, but is hoping to leave directly after and make it to Toronto by mid day Saturday.  If that happens, I will freak out completely.  My mom wants him to paint a huge picture of Mema's house.  That's how much she loved THE BELOVED SIDNEY painting he did for me.  Bloody awesome!  +Tonight JD is actually joining me @ Fridays with ze comic shop crew.  Kickass!    +Me and Jeemy are discussing HARRY POTTER via email...and JD is attempting to get MM to send me those books he promised.  cross your fingers for me!!!  +++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       urlLink     Yes, my bass guitar has a name.  I call it special sauce because of the colors.  McDonalds Special Sauce is made with MAYO and KETCHUP.  My guitar is copper with an ivory pickguard.  Its the coolest damn bass you ever will see.  Its an IBANEZ EXPRESSIONIST aka pretty damn slick.

Daddy-O will take a look @ some paperwork for me and I'm gonna see HARRY POTTER 3 (my first in ze theatre--this one looks so FUCKING cool--and dammit if Little Harry Potter is turning into quite a looker!  Jailbait!)  +I also meet me new bandmates tomorrow for HAPPY HOUR and a quick chat over cocktails.  Pulled out Special Sauce from the basement and jammed a little bit.  +Quizzo.

       Study Hall 6.1.04   I am sitting behind him in this dank lecture hall.  "Space, Time and Motion"  written on paper with the hurried illegible chicken scratch of an Apathetic Icon  He is on autopilot--head down and then SHOOTS back up to catch the next line  on the blackboard.  Submerged...pressure...emerged.  There are ink stains covering  his olive fingers and arms with a pattern all its own. Endless time spent pouring over books, scribbling like DAS FUHRER. Pencil eraser lodged in jagged bitten nails.  He wears his intensity like a plastic sheriff's badge tacked lopsided to his GI JOE T-shirt and then he has turned around.  A nick on his face glares @ me and says: "Das Ist Mein Kampf" But the smile on his face is deceving... A shiver of desire runs down my spine and he feels the relief of victory pulse through his chest down his arms, to his fingers where written on page I peer over his shoulder to see: "This is so high school."  +++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++

       Rock'n'Roll Kids...Rock'n'Roll   So um, I'm in a band again!  Ok, I was just asked not an hour ago to join LX's new project, and of course I said yes!  Its been MUCH TOO MUCH TOO long since I've picked up Ze Special Sauce (yeah, I have a name for my bass! Its too cute not to!) and rocked out.  And it sounds like goth/metal goodness.  I'm totally down.  I had tried to get in on Little John and Elisha's band a few months back but they had just found a bassist.  And J to the Rizzock has been talking about a band forever, but nothing as of yet has materialized.  LX has a guitarist, some songs, and its sounding pretty damn good right now.  I need something new to pass the time.  Oh cross your fingers for me that this ends up working out!  ++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++

        And then, later that evening...   &nbsp;  There has been so much VILE-Ness and VULGARITY since my last entry.&nbsp; Let's just say Sunday came in like a lamb and out like a bat out of hell.&nbsp; I was going about my business, checking my PM's on BENDIS! board, when this girl whom I never talked to PM'ed me with "I think you should see this"...what followed were threads started on ANOTHER board, not BENDIS's, but one with some of the same members.&nbsp; Some of them that had been nice to me in the past...with such lovely thread titles as  &nbsp;   I WANT TO FUCK MARY THE WRETCHED   -and-   So who is the first on this board (referring to BENDIS!) to get fucked?   followed by such well put together and intelligent posts like:   Vile Boy#1:  ill try and get some pussy from mary in chicago. fuck up JD, get her drunk and dunk my shit in that hole.   Vile Boy#2:  I don't give a fuck. If I see her in person, I WILL FUCK HER. Either by permission or by rape. I don't care.&nbsp;    (here&nbsp;he posted of picture of&nbsp;me&nbsp;AND MY&nbsp;2 LITTLE SISTERS!!!!!)   &nbsp;[she's] The one in the middle. But I don't give a fuck, I'll fuck all three.   Vile Boy #1:  yeah, shes one board member who id love to fuck, too bad shes fucking JD already.&nbsp; plus im gonna be in chicago, so ill see her too!! goddamit.   Vile Boy #2:  HE's gotta another thing coming. Vile Boy #1, fuck Mary the Wretched if I cannot. that goes for any body going to Chi town. That is your goal. Fuck her. post pics.  +++++++++end of VILE BOY POSTING++++++++++++  &nbsp;  I have gone through many emotions since then...I was in tears for a while...I was so angry I wanted to scream...I was afraid to go to TORONTO...  &nbsp;  But in this business, there are frat boy punk little boy pricks that say vile things behind your back...and there are heroes.&nbsp; And here are my heroes:  1--JD  2--MARK MILLAR  3--BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS  4--MICHAEL AVON OEMING  5--WARREN ELLIS (who told JD that there was nothing to worry about, as he knew that if any of them approached them I would "rip off their dicks and make a bonfire with them"  6--DAVID MACK  7--ANDY LEE  8--DEATHSTROKE  9--DaGETHIGHKNIGHT  10--KOOP  11--DARICK ROBERTSON  12--KEG TO DA LEG!!!!!  &nbsp;  All of the above have been the most supportive people in the entire world, and told me that I have nothing to worry about...ever.&nbsp; I think that what bothered me the most is of ALL the bloody pics I have on the internet, why post the one of me and my sisters???&nbsp; Iron Belly Shelly is not even 13 yet!!!&nbsp; I have since password protected all my personal online photo albums and am laying low on the message boards (just a lurker for the time being) as to avoid any other shite.&nbsp;  Yes, these boys were probably just talking shite, never meant a word, etc and fucking so on.&nbsp; But they also thought that they were doing this in secret, on the internet, and actually made some pretty BOLD statements towards me and JD.&nbsp; Not cool @ all.  &nbsp;  What's the best part about this whole thing?&nbsp; We got 26000 hits on the site on Monday.&nbsp; And 12000 the day after that.&nbsp; How fucking sick is that?&nbsp; Curiosity indeed kills the cat.&nbsp; I've really been laying low in everything.&nbsp; I'm out of Valium AND synthroid, hoping SIBERIAN ROOT and ZOLOFT will keep me from slitting my wrists (that's a joke kittlings, I dig myself way to much for that).&nbsp; I've just been watching movies, reading comix, practicing guitar.&nbsp; Trying not to drink...which is very hard when I feel this way.&nbsp; Its been rainy as hell and Donna's basement flooded to the point of MUD and shite getting in there so she's out today and possibly tomorrow b/c they can't cement up the spot where its coming in until the rain stops.  &nbsp;  *DARK WATER---better than RINGU, ending sucked.&nbsp; Will buy this one for myself.  *THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT--stupid.&nbsp; Insulting.&nbsp; And the director's cut ending has a baby hanging himself with&nbsp;his own&nbsp;umbilical in his mother's womb.&nbsp; Ugh...drivel.   And finally: the beginnings of a poem:  Until these bite wounds disappear,  I will not be able to contain the fear.   ++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++&nbsp;   &nbsp;

        80's Decadence Heaven     &nbsp;  Joe went insane and bought about 5 million dvd's @ BEST BUY.&nbsp; Or maybe just 5 or 6.&nbsp; But of these he got:   +DURAN DURAN video collection   +THE POLICE video collection   +DAVID BOWIE video collection(TOKYO! SOUTH AMERICA!)   +COLD MOUNTAIN (Jude and Jack White together!&nbsp; GIRL PORN APPROVED!! ©)    &nbsp;  So yeah, we've been watchign 80's videos all day long b/c I was too dead to anything.&nbsp; This weekend was complete insanity.&nbsp; Since I'll be writing about it for the web site i'll just say:   1--the second night was MUCH better soundwise   2--was able to score VIP (balcony) area for Friday and gave out my card to some "contacts"   3--Met JESS, BAM, RAKE and EVIL JARED.&nbsp; That kicked so much ass.   4--Ivy has lost some weight and is looking quite good!&nbsp; It was so good seeing her, I miss my dear!   5--after last night's show we went to Little John's and E-Lisha's party to hang for a bit. Had fun discussing eating meat and whatnot.&nbsp; I stayed for 2 lager's (yeah I'm drinking lager now...disgusting isn't it???) and then came home.&nbsp; I slept to 11-ish today and woke up to SLEEPY HOLLOW (my fave XPN music program...its like waking up TO a dream).    &nbsp;  Oh yes, and let me just state that the entire Pfeiffer family is fucked and Marlene is going to help me sell the piano and I'm going to get half of whatever it sells for.&nbsp; I told Bock that if she or his sister starts complaing about the damn thing, to take an axe to it and trash it...I'm so sick of it.&nbsp; I don't even care about the money anymore.&nbsp; i'm gonna sell a couple comics and my PEZ collection on EBAY to make some synth cash.    &nbsp;  Nothing is really going on tonight besides 6 FEET UNDER, DA ALI G show, and me pondering why I'm getting my period again when I just had it like 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; Perhaps stress; I think this happened to me once before and because&nbsp;I ended up working 4 hours overtime this week, it very well could be that.&nbsp; Dane is coming back to work @ Barthco, LX couldn't even make practice Thursday b/c of work...suck!!!&nbsp; But I did get to show mike my bass line and he recorded it so we shall see (if I already posted this...sorry you just had to read that last sentence again. heh).    &nbsp;  So it goes...    &nbsp;  ++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++   &nbsp;

        I get to get up @ 6:30am tomorrow       &nbsp;  Hooray!&nbsp; I'm going into work early so I can leave right @ 5 with nothing on my desk.&nbsp; I left masters b/c I couldn't even get to them today...me and Donna had a talk about dividing up work and my "attitude" from last week when she got all salty for me being sarcastic.&nbsp; She told me to let her know when I can't get to something and she'll make sure she gets Sohail or someone else to do it.&nbsp; So that was cool.&nbsp; He was out the last 2 days and the last 2 days I stayed until 6pm.&nbsp; LX didn't leave until after 9 tonight...he is prolly hating that job more than life itself right now.    &nbsp;  Last night me and E-mart danced our hearts out--it was hella fun and we're going back in 2 weeks.&nbsp; Can't wait! The 80's room was packed but Kat Fadigan, my bio lab teacher from TEMPLE was spinning and she played BOWIE's "FASHION" for us so I was happy.&nbsp; Yes yes, fun fun.    &nbsp;  Tonight we practiced without Mike and I got some guitar lessons AS WELL AS showing him the bass line I've had in me head for quite a while.&nbsp; And he recorded and is gonna see what he can do with it!! Awesome!&nbsp; So yeah, we actually did shite other than just stand around.    &nbsp;  Tomorrow is BHG and then Saturday is BHG.&nbsp; Ivy was able to get tix for Saturday.&nbsp; Oh yeah, the biggest news is that Ericka bitched to Jake about writing me a check, and then she bitched to Marlene, who called and said she would help&nbsp;me sell it.&nbsp; But I've been trying to get ahold of Jake all night b/c I just want the guitar from him and then I'm done.&nbsp; I'm saying goodbye to Bo-Licious, getting the guitar, amp and any other music related items I can fit in ze van, and never going back to that house.&nbsp; The fucker point blank lied to me and said it was gone when it really wasn't.&nbsp; I'm sick of the whole thing and just want to be done with it and him.    &nbsp;  So that's about it.&nbsp; Watched KWAIDAN, which I akin to MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (that ole campfire story)...its like sorta scary, but is so old and predictable you're just like "yeah...ok"&nbsp; Mos def a classic and some of the shots and use of color is hella cool--but nowhere near as creepy as neo-asian horror.    &nbsp;  That's it kiddies.&nbsp; I hate my job and I'm ready for the weekend so I can rage. ~rage kittlings, rage~    &nbsp;  +++++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

I read THE SAD STORY OF LELA...retooled.&nbsp; Went well.&nbsp; Also did MR DIRECTOR SIR to promote the book--which 2 people bought!!! Prolly helps that I've lowered the price to $5 but hell, its all good.&nbsp; Passed out my card, talked to some of my faves, only 2 people really sucked.&nbsp; It was just a good crowd and K215 is doing the right thing by hosting something in Center City.&nbsp; Its perfect, and the it was packed!&nbsp; I'm totally helping promote the next one--AUGUST 23rd--and E-mart already said he would like to perform.&nbsp; So thats hella cool.    &nbsp;  +Keg Leg tipped me off to UTRECHT on Broad (which is actually right next to the WILMA so it worked out brilliantly), and so I got myself the PERFECT  Toshio Blue  pastel, some colored pencils, charcoals and a sketch book.&nbsp; Yes, I just copy shite that I've already seen.&nbsp; Yes, I basically suck.&nbsp; But its fun as all hell.&nbsp; To top it all off, Stefan is starting a oil paint series of sneakers on telephone wires, so I'm gonna help him with taking pictures of the ones around South Philly.&nbsp; So I'm gonna get back into that as well.&nbsp; I used the pastel to fix up my TOSHIO #1 drawing, which I'll be putting up on me blog tonight.    &nbsp;  + DeathCurse,&nbsp;Bone Machine, Skull-Phonic,  whatever you want to call&nbsp;it--THE BAND,&nbsp;is just fuct.&nbsp; Its not a bad thing, its just weird right now.&nbsp; LX knows my intentions at least.&nbsp; I love playing, I want to learn the Synth, and I want to rock out.&nbsp; Mike, our guitarist and main songwriter, is ITCHING to play though.&nbsp; So I guess it makes me and LX feel like we have this deadline hanging over our head.&nbsp; At least that's how I feel.&nbsp; But practice is on Thursday, we'll do what we can, and we'll go from there.    &nbsp;  +Tonight is dinner and a movie night; me and JD are watching A SIMPLE PLAN and he's making some pasta and I'm making bread and it will be nice and sweet and cute.    &nbsp;  +SCRIBBLE has been resurrected!!!!&nbsp; We're gonna start a small section on  urlLink http://www.simplyjd.com &nbsp;that will house all our little poetry/prose/stories that don't have a home.&nbsp; Makes me happy to have my Temple Zine back in action, if only for a small spot on our money-maker SimplyJD online...(not really a money-maker, but the springboard for the millions me and JD plan to make...heh).    &nbsp;  And that's about it for now.&nbsp; Tomorrow night is NOCTURNE so I'm doing laundry tonight so I can decide what the hell I'm gonna wear.&nbsp; Its strictly 80's though, I may get a wrist band but only to see if OCTAVIO is spinning downstairs.&nbsp; Me and E-Mart are gonna rock out to Bowie all night long!!!&nbsp; **under the moonlight, the serious moonlight**    &nbsp;  +++++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++++

Saturday I stayed out way to late with J Rock after work, which was 8 hours of sheer boredom but at least I got money since I can't withdrawl money via mac b/c SOME STUPID WHORES stole my wallet.&nbsp; But yeah, we watched the first made-for-TV  JUON .&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I was kind of on the nod so I missed parts but it did explain a bit.&nbsp; To top it all off, I've drawn 2 pics of  TOSHIO  in the past 2 days, and saw the American Teaser Trailer for  THE GRUDGE.&nbsp;  Yes, I'm so obsessed that I need to be beaten with a bamboo reed.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Today we saw  ANCHORMAN  with Dane and Neary, which was HI-larious.&nbsp;  JACK BLACK  had a cameo so that made my day.&nbsp; After that we came home and I finished watching  TOMIE , which I fell asleep on.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;me and JD went to South St. to drop off movies ( PARTY MONSTER --very cool;&nbsp; RINGU --ok, and  TOMIE ) and pick up some new ones ( KWAIDAN  and A  SIMPLE PLAN ).&nbsp; Then we went to  HIKARU , this Japanese restaurant and its was hella&nbsp;good.&nbsp; I've been watching TV ever since...yes yes. &nbsp; I must decide what (if any) poems I'm reading tomorrow @ the reading for K215.&nbsp; I think  MR DIRECTOR SIR  is a definite, with THE  SAD STORY OF LELA ...a mos def as well.&nbsp; I'm gonna post my TOSHIO&nbsp;draw-rings and then get the heck offline so I can look over all my latest shite and see if&nbsp;anything appeals to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even&nbsp;if I don't read I think it will be&nbsp;nice to get out and hear some poetry and promote the scene.&nbsp; Work tomorrow...what a bummer. &nbsp; ++++++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++++&nbsp;

        I HEART TOSHIO     &nbsp;  Yes yes, what a day its been.&nbsp; For I think the first time ever, Donna got really pissed @ me @ work...it was insane.&nbsp; All because of me and my sarcasm.&nbsp; No doubt, I'm a sarcastic little bee-yotch, but sarcasm is based on truth.&nbsp; And its true that I've been doing 90% of the bookings lately.&nbsp; And the repetition would drive even the most sane person mad.&nbsp; And we all know I'm not even close to sane to begin with.    &nbsp;  I got valium for my jaw clenching and overall work stress.&nbsp; That is how much I hate my job, and why I've stopped caring and taking everything so personally.&nbsp; If I want to be a writer, I've got to do it dammit and not worry about BARTHCO.&nbsp; EVIL EVIL EVIL place that it is. Oh yes, I have a  JUON  against it.&nbsp; You better believe it.    &nbsp;  Tonight I'm going to LX's for some R&amp;R.&nbsp; We're not really practicing...we'll probably just bitch about the job and watch some MICHEL GONDRY videos and chill.&nbsp; I haven't seen his new place so it should be fun.&nbsp; I got RINGU today and still have to watch TOMIE.&nbsp;They didn't have SHIKOKU or UZUMAKI but this dapper gay man behind the counter @ TLA said he would order them in for me.&nbsp; I'm in total lurve with TLA VIDEO and it sucks that I didn't discover it until now.&nbsp; They have tons of ITALIAN horror too.&nbsp; But just like when I've got a plate of different kind of foods, one at a time.&nbsp; I need to exhaust my Asian Horror Obsession.&nbsp;CURE was some good shite.&nbsp; A weird and existentialist flick...JUON still holds a special place in my heart.&nbsp; I also picked up RUE MORGUE b/c J Rock tipped me off to the fact that they had a huge JUON article.&nbsp; Got the new BIZARRE as well.    &nbsp;  I got my plane ticket last night...charged it for the simple fact that the price went down to $240 so I couldn't pass it up.&nbsp; I can't bloody wait, and Chi-Town still hasn't even happened yet!&nbsp; MILLAR is saying he's still down for the ULTIMATES quiz.&nbsp; If I can get MILLAR and BENDIS! to do interviews with me I will feel SO goddamn accomplished.&nbsp; ::crosses fingers::    &nbsp;  Listening to WHITE STRIPES. Oh yes, I got the disease that only JACK WHITE can cure.&nbsp; My dinner consisted of crackers and salmon cream cheese.&nbsp; My lunch was pretzels.&nbsp; I've lost all appetite lately.&nbsp; Which isn't a bad thing when you've got a spare bike tire around you middle...hehehe.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I wish I had more neato and cool things to report but I'm waiting for me mum to return so I can start synth shopping.&nbsp; And that, my kittlings, is when things will get fun.&nbsp; Oh you can count on that.    &nbsp;  +++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       I just don't know what to do with myself...   +I like the WHITE STRIPES...a year or two too late but nonetheless I dig them.  That is all...  +JUON has a big article in RUE MORGUE magazine, must pick up on Friday when I get BIZARRE mag and some more movies from TLA video  +TLA Video is Rokken Like Dokken.  CHEAP movies, all kinds of indies, and ASIAN CULT!!! Rock'n'Roll kittlings.  +Um...I'm not gonna mince words here...I got some. I think you know what I'm talking about...::nudge nudge, wink wink::  +Open mike on Monday for K215.  I may sign up and read one of my new poems that has no "i"'s in it...maybe THE SAD STORY OF LELA AND HER LOVER or SPINDELINA or something...maybe not.  Regardless I'm going to support my local poet scene.  +no alcohol, no pirate rum, I'm being a good lil girl.  Drinking some tea and preparing to watch THE CURE, another asian horror flick.  I rented 3 this week.  THE EYE mos def had its moments.  Thank you Ms. Irate for my brand new obsession...and I totally mean that!  Its given me something to concentrate on instead of drugs...  +I can't get ahold of Bock to get this piano thing straightened up but my purchases are going in the order of PLANE TICKET and then synth.  the sooner I get the ticket the cheaper it will be.  +I am in love with yahoo!'s new instant messenger...you can change your display pic like every 2 seconds if you want...I don't know why this makes me sublimely happy but it totally does.  +Jeemy has come to me with some more business stuff...and all I can think is "where do I sign" and all I can say is "i gots to get paid!"  +Me and LX are getting together on Thurs sans mike for some unofficial "practice" i.e., talking about the band, watching DVD's and whatnot.  I'm hoping I can help him on the bass a little if need be.  He'll be playing Special Sauce until he can get his dream 6 string fretless.  He's decided to go right handed.  SS will be in good hands.  +Tomorrow is GORMAN.  I will more than likely be getting Valium for my jaw clenching since I'm still doing it and making myself almost insane from the pain sometimes.  +And I'm spent...time for some ASIAN CULT/HORROR goodness.  !~Rage, kids, Rage~!  +++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++

       That't it, I quit!   I'm done.  When I woke up this morning, it became painfully obvious that I blacked out again.  Painful indeed, as my head was pounding from the 2 glasses of wine I imbibed last night.  A drinker such as myself does not black out from 2 glasses of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay, but wine will give you a killer headached the next day, regardless of quantity.  But this is besides the point, as it was the tranqs that made me black out...I'm sure of it.  So I'm done.  I am in a tough spot as I take pills to make myself sane, and abuse these very pills.  But I'm done.  I'm drying out kittlings, b/c my memory is gone.  I have been so fucked up for so long and I just let the shame spiral just keep going.  And I want to be doing something productive...not looking for my next high (or low, as it were).  Blah blah blah. Its been said before.  No drinking until Chi-Town kiddies.  I'm serious.  And in this order, this is my plan of action: 1--Sell my piano (i'm hoping to get Jake to do most of the work by telling him i'll split ze profit 50/50) 2--Buy a Synth 3--Buy a plane ticket to Toronto 4--Buy a bike 5--Save up money for more 'good things' 6--Gather info for my possible interviews with Bendis and Millar 7--Gather info for my C.C.C. 8--Try not to kill myself or abuse alcohol and other shite that is just controlling me  LX is my sponsor almost in this whole thing, as he has been able to quit before and is able to both listen and relate.  And I don't want to be out of it altogether.  I just want to be able to say "one glass of wine please" and be done with it, instead of drinking straight from the bottle, popping 4 tranqs in one night and hoping for the best.  That's just lame.  God, the money I've wasted on all this.  Ugh...I'm not even identifiable without it.  And I think that scares me more than anything else.  I'm so afraid that I'm not a real person, a special person, without it...so lame.  Anyway, today was a band field trip to Sam Ash and Guitar Center.  And JD had mentioned before that maybe since my car still has some life left in her, I should be saving up for more pressing things.  So a synth is first on my list.  I'm researching right now and I think I'm probably going to go with a ROLAND, prolly a used one off EBAY.  I just need a good beginner synth that will get me started.  I'm also considering lessons to learn how to use the damn thing so I can progress.  I also have decided to fly to Toronto to save time/hassle by driving.  I figure I can save the money for that in 2 paychecks.  I had already taken off tomorrow for the court date that isn't happening now, so I'm just saying fuck it and not going in.  That way I can sit here tomorrow and finish my column.  I still don't have a 3rd thing to write about but I actually may write about DEAD AGAIN, even though Kenneth Branaugh makes me cringe.  That film was pretty damn good.  So it goes.  I'm also gonna probably head to South St. and try to rent THE EYE.  I got GORMAN this week and on Thursday me and LX are getting together for some "jamming" since Mike can't practice.  Should be fun.  JD bought me a real nice tank and hoodie @ the Borgata...he's a sweetie.  He made chicken alfredo tonight for dinner and I made garlic bread.  It was yummy.  I'm falling in love with him all over again.  I'm just trying to keep our communication as open as possible.  I don't want to resent him for things unsaid anymore.  I adore MyJD.  Almost mid-July already and I finally painted my toenails.  took me long enough!  Hehe...I just don't want to be a slacker anymore.    I really want to write a short story or something.  But I think its going to end up being about addiction.  But maybe that's a good thing.  Kurt just wrote a story about something he was scared about and found it cathartic.  It sounds like it might help...  +++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       The Sad Story of Lela and Her Lover  or  The Spotless Blonde.   When she kissed her lips amidst the greytones-- then later slapped the  tea cup out of her hand, onlookers might say that this was the end  of the affair. Still others believe that the carresses went on  for months later until the will of her heart drove a painful fisting, followed by a bullet to the head.  But the brain it entered was not her lover's...but her own. In pictures they said, they saw her smile was weary. Always the smile of uneasy jealousy-- lust container by fear.  +++++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++++

       Toronto Anyone?   I need a driving buddy to TORONTO (Andeelee may have the car space but I'm thinking it might be a good idea to have a back-up plan).  Anyone want to go the last week in August????  If not, then I'm really thinking I will be a grown-up type of gal and drive meself...it might be fun...on my own and w/o a care in the world except CANADA and Con Geekdom???  I could do it...I will do it if need be.   Tonight we're watching BATTLE ROYALE.  Tomorrow is practice and perhaps hanging with Stefan.  Friday is SPIDERMAN PART DEUX. Saturday is work from 4-10pm.  Sunday is the final edit of my column.  Already got almost 2 full parts written.    BOOYAKASHA!  ++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++

       Under the Bridge Downtown...is where I drew some blood...   So....let's see, bad news first: 1--Me and JD were THISCLOSE to breaking up on Sunday.  We were @ the Phillies game and then left b/c I was being quiet and everything just reached fever pitch and then BOOM! We're finally telling each other everything that has gone wrong the past few months.  And how I'm partying a little too hard and he's staying a little too silent.  Oh yes, the wounds are much deeper than that but it was just such a fucking relief to say EVERYTHING that needed to be said.  He was holding back so much from me and I from him that we had nothing.  We've both decided to make concious efforts to change certain things.  Believe me when I say that all of this has already made me MUCH HAPPIER with a relationship that has not been going well at all.  I love JD so much...and I know that we need to be together.  2--Iron Belly Shelly's court date has been postponed due to Larry and Jennifer not signing the papers saying they even received the papers.  So it goes...my new dilemma is deciding whether or not I wanna take Monday off...  3--Time for some self-concious worrying--**haven't heard from Jeemy so I'm automatically thinking that any writing I've sent him has totally put him off on me and involving me with any sort of business venture.  Because I suck!!!!  Ugh...I hate my self-depracating manner but I feel rejection creeping up everytime I don't get a reaction...  Anyway,  Good News  1--Vinyl-licious!  I got so much cheap vinyl this weekend.  I spent $9 total on: STAR WARS ALICE IN WONDERLAND (original music 1963) ADAM AND THE ANTS--2 LP's DAVID BOWIE--LET'S DANCE --I think that's it-- 2--Had fun @ ze bar with Keg Leg, A&E, and J Rock for Zim's birthday. 3--FINALLLY did the LOTR marathon with JD on Monday.  From 12:30 until 11:30pm we watched all 3 LOTR films, it was very neat!  We had gone to the grocery store very early that day so we had our own in-home veg and gorge-fest.  It was WAY TOO HOT to be going anywhere.  That didn't stop us from going to DEBO's for a cook-out on Sunday after the baseball game and argument 'under the bridge', where we ate some more food.  It was so hot though I was just not feeling it.  But everyone was super nice...  Argh...anyway, back to work and all that.  JD is @ home so I'm im'ing him on YIM.  The band stuff is a little weird right now so we're just taking it day by day.  I need something creative and positive to focus on.  I also want to get our bedroom finished, decoration-wise.  That means getting my ass in gear with teh stencilling and curtain decisions.  It will be such a nice place to chill once its finished...  ++++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       9:20 on a Saturday...   And I've already purchased BLOODHOUND GANG tickets and posted on BENDIS!'s board.  Rokken like Dokken.  Also made breakfast and coffee.  Bloody Hell Mary! How do you do it???  Headaches kid, they always get me up and ready to start the day!  Last night we ended up going to Fridays with J Rock and Mr. Cyphere.  I met Anney Ryan whose poetry is supposed to be some kickass shite.  I also heard this lady talking about how annoying my smoking was so I said really bitcy "i'll move then" and got up and walked to the other side of the bar.  "it's a bar, Jesus Christ" I muttered as I walked away.  Keg Leg wanted to RAGE but I kept her calm and the lady even came over and was like "smoking just really gets on my nerves" so I said to her "you could've asked me to move, you could've moved, but no, you chose to sit there and talk about me and I really didn't want to hear it anymore."  God it was hella lame...  Anyway, JD didn't join us b/c he was right--I spent way more money than I wanted to.  But today is ZERNS and MARK's party so I'm ready to rock out.    and stefan never came out...surprise surprise  ++++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++

       Rage, Kiddies, RAGE!   R&R This weeked.  Rage and Rawkusness...hardcore.  Tonight, Keg to Da Leg is heading down to Philly so we can see FAHRENHEIT 9/11 and then head to South St for drinkies afterwards. Tomorrow, we go to ZERNS for some random shopping and then ZIM's party is that nite @ Tom's bar.  Expected to be there: Little Johnny, J to the Rizzock, Nick, A and E-lisha, Mr. Cyphere and various others... Sunday is the Phillies Game, a punk rock show @ THE LAKES, a BBQ @ DEBO's, and that's about it.  Now here is the kicker--JD is hanging with me ALL 3 days!!!!!  WTF????  Yes, that's what I said.  Tis amazing...but I've been able to contain my excitement.  Really it is a rare thing for us to be together so much outside of work.  It should be nice!  USHER aka ALEX AVELINO got back to me and offered his place up for crashing in August for the next TORONTO CON so all I have to do is secure a way to get up there, and I'm gonna be ROKKEN LIKE DOKKEN!!!! I can't bloody wait for AUGUST.  Chi-Town and Toronto in one month!  Does the fun ever start???  Work is finally slowing down and good thing b/c I got 45 mins left and I'm ready to rock out.  We're getting sushi for dinner then I go home and wait for Keg Leg to get there.  LX and Val may be joining us for the movie, which is kewl.  Practice was kinda silly.  We taught LX a couple bass lines and I figured out the notes for piano--now i must "ARRANGE" ::insert maniacal laugh here::  This is gonna be funny, I mean FUN!  hehehe...

       *Juno 106—Mein Stolz Und Freude*   I have placed a bid on a synth—a JUNO 106—there was another sweet ROLAND that came with a hard case as well but after reading more about it I am gonna have go with the JUNO.  In the way of vintage synths, it is still used today by A LOT of professional musicians.  So it goes…  I’m bored.  Bored at work is something that does not happen a lot these days so I’m taking full advantage.  Adam—aka JAGER GUY—is texting me about going to ABLILENE tonight but my anxiety is fucking with my head.  I couldn’t sleep last night.  I kept waking up and it just sucked!  Its like I can’t calm down and GOD DO I MISS MY TRANQS!!!  I’ve just gotta make it till Saturday when I can pick up my Valium RX.  Until then, SIBERIAN ROOT and sleeping pills it is!!!  Me and Frank (aka DaGetHighKnight) have been emailing back and forth all day.  He has a blackberry ::sigh:: and he’s helping me with the synth shite since he’s so savvy at it. ç=alliteration is fun!  He’s a very nice guy…and we seem to help each other with our respective mental disorders.  ROCK!  I finished my BHG Review last night…thank god! It took me forever but I persevered and got it done.  Tonight I’m not sure what I’m doing but I do believe it will involve dying my hair and lounging about.  I’ll probably pass out @ 10pm from lack of sleep.  I watched Ju-On again last night b/c I’m insane.  It still makes me jump…its great!  I was reading Kurt’s latest story on the bus this morning and that made me feel more like vomiting—but in a good way.  He says that like Poe, he writes about stuff that creeps him out.  Ugh…he writes about stuff that would creep anyone out.  I have been totally digging all the stuff he’s passed along to me.  MILLAR is mos def a go…and THE ULTIMATES fucking rule…I read the whole series once and am about to embark on my second time, with an outline for each issue this time around.  I have no idea how serious he is about this quiz but I want to be ready just in case…BENDIS! has not said yes or no to an interview.  So I shall go prepared for that as well, but not really sure if things will turn out the way I hope.  If not I know that Stuart would like to get some more exposure on our site.  And he’s a rockin’ good time.  I should really email Alex A. about Toronto…just to make sure we’re still go with that.  Would hate to get there and have no place to stay…yarrr~!  Alright, time to do a few masters and look busy. ++++++++++end of transmission++++++++++++

       *I AM SINISTAR*   Me and LX both totally wanted to be called SINISTAR, but it appears the name is already taken in like a thousand different variations.  Why must we be plagued with the curse of the “no name band” syndrome???  We can’t decide on anything.  But here are some more I was thinking of: ABYSMAL SUNDAY THE GRUDGE (this will no longer be cool once the movie comes out) SPLINTERED CELL  Those suck.  Forget I even wrote them.  Anyway, I need hair dye and soon.  My roots are coming in really bad and I MUST get my head shaved before Chicago in the hopes that I will look more like a pirate and less like a chia pet.  JD wants to get his hair tipped…I’m really not sure how I feel about this…  This weekend we spent in YORK pa, with the ‘rents.  Can I vent for a couple seconds?  I came there to visit of course because I hadn’t been there in a month.  JD came with so it was fun b/c we just vegged and watched movies and Satellite TV and ate and drank tons.  But I also got to witness Iron Belly do whatever she pleased and still sleep with me mum (she’s almost 13!).  Jaci Red-Handed bought me a cool pirate flag, but then also got $300 bucks out of my parents for various things, while I signed to have power of attorney and executor of their wills and got money back from them that my mom was holding for me for my synth purchase.  Now, I just hate the way they’re being taken advantage of and they just allow it to happen.  It drives me totally mad.  And maybe I am a bit pissed off that I don’t get help with anything and the thanks I get is few and far between.  So whatever.  I’m gonna quit whining now.  I just wish the rest of their children wouldn’t walk all over them.  They don’t’ deserve that shite.  As for THE VILLAGE…I totally dug it, the rest of the fam did not.  I think that SHYMALAN gets really great performances out of people, everyone that was in it had a strain and sadness upon them (with the exception of HOWARD, who was the light of the whole film); I don’t’ want to say too much about it yet as I’m writing about it for this month’s column and I’ll wait till then to add spoilers but scene and shot-wise, there are certain parts that make the film on the whole worth it.  Not my fave film of his but I was happy with it.  I also spent way too much money on various items—some stuff from HOT TOPIC, a music magazine from the UK, the new KEOKI CD, and a “music journal” for writing music tabliature.  It was fun though and I got a lot of cool stuff so I can’t complain.  That is all the shopping I can do for awhile though as CHI-TOWN and TORONTO are huge events that I need to save money for.  Its so slow in work today yet I still feel on the verge of an anxiety attack which totally sucks b/c I seem to have no reason for it.  I was going to go out tonight if J Rock and Mr. Cyphere were doing Fridays but I’m gonna stay in, try to save money and do some cleaning and synth shopping online.  I would really like to see them and Keg Leg soon though…I’m trying to save money but I miss everyone.  Adam—JAGER GUY—is gonna be back in Philly tomorrow and I may try to go to ABILENE and hang with him for a bit.  We shall see.  Free JAGER at least! Even though that stuff makes me cringe. Damn…I still have to write about BHG…I have notes I should try to finish that up tonight…ok so now I have real goals.  Rock’n’Roll. ++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++
