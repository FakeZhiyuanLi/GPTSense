      to  almost  every  negative  aspect of our lives ,  we  can  blame  ourselves.. or alteast  i think so .. so its time to face the music...  its my fault , i blame my self and im  truly sorry  to those all those who  i've  hurt... however i do  believe  that i am not the only one to blame. but this is my  sorry.   sOrRy wont fix it but its a start.  if ppl talk crap wat am i to do about it? if ppl don't like me, wat am i to do about it? y shud i even believe yu anyways? then again y shud yu believe me? no one knows the  truth , not even  me  ...  Honestly, if your the one complaining 24/7 then aren't yu the one bIthCiNg... if your the one complaining about the group fallin' apart and all this gossip then shudn't yu NOT be gossiping, if yu want the group to fiX up shudn't yu not leave every now and then and talk crap?? i mean c'mon.. we have all made mistakes, and we have all turned our heads but enough is enough.. i mean i've made terrible mistakes to, i said things i shudn't have, talked when i shudn't have, cussed here and there, but have i reallie gone that farr? serioulsy theres something hidden,  something yu wont tell me ... something i think is a  lie .  we need to get to the bottom of this           thATs aLL i kNOwE

      I think that we are all just soo  wrong  that we can’t even see  riiight . No one knows what to do or say anymore and all our actions and words have turned into a  bunch of crap . The truth hits us every now and then but I guess it hasn’t hit us hard enough. We’re making  mistakes  on top of old one’s that were  never fixed  and now we’re just  stuuuuck . We need to blow off all this steam. >> nobody even knows the  full story … to every outburst theres a  hidden reason that yu just don’t know.. all I can say is what the heck happened?!?!?  Its not over t ill the fat lady siings!! But too damn bad none of us has the  guts … pEaCe OuT             >> rAdhA  p.s.      nobodaay  really knows some one else’s  heart , yu don’t know what the person thinks at night or how they  truly feel  so don’t let  gossip  take a hold of yu… step away from this  vice  and only believe whats in your heart     sTaY sTrOng & keep  pUsHinG  oN [[uH huH]]  HOOBASTANK ~ the reason    sorry  to  you all  for everthaaaang, for all the mistakes, for all the harsh words, the things i cud have done, the things i did... everythaaaaaang.. please understand too bad i don't have the guts to say this to your face but if yu don't like me well im sorry then that is  just not mah problem  after all im not too sure if i like mah self so how can anybodaay else??

      i hate feelin' like im not gonna  make it , it just hurts so much. its like doin' all that homework, paying attention in class, taking notes, studying.. doin' all that crap for nothing!! for fucking nothing!! i know i don't try as hard as i could have but nonethe less i do work hard. im so scarred. my bro is a frikin genuis, all my cousins are at a UC... its an "indian" thing to be smart, but i got jipped. im not smart. its not all natural, its wroking hard and laziness has tooken over me. and den a part of me "knowes" that school isn't that important. its about life, friends and God. i wish i talked to god more. but i dunno i feel as if i do waht god tells me to do, or do the "religios" things i shud, its liek proving iM not gonna make it... i dunno its something hidden, unconsious i just can't "retrieve" it but all i know is that it  hurts  like  hell . all this frustration and stress is causing m to become ill physically. i cna see it. not proper sleeping habits. not eatin right. not doing well in dancing not like i was good or anythign but now i suck like crap. taking soo man damn naps . wasting my time online. ruining friendships left and right. fucking upp in school. fucking up sat. seriously i hate the SAT, proves Crap and yet they use that. what the heck!! i hate it all. i hate how so many smart ppl who don't even work hard get A's and i struggle so hard and only get b's and even c's... sometimes i get a's... but not enough and only in the easy classes. i dunno wat happend. i dunno how i used to think that i was sooo smart.. i used to think oh i don't try enough but then y don't i try... i  hate  it i  hate  it and i  hate  it!! ughhhh ..  wtf  is up with all this ... i miss ppl so much... i miss the before... i miss it all.. if i cud start this year over.. if i cud have first quarters gpa.. if if if.. but no there is no if.. only it is.. ahhhhhh and they say this life is just a dream and that we are just to "into" it then y am i trying so hardd..... to live up too it all when i know deep down that its just a little too late..  "Living in the world, is a training in attaining the Lord. Perform your worldly duty with complete sincerity, in such a way that your conscience remains crystal clear. This duty can become a medium to experience the supreme. There is no need to change your work or your place, provided your life is full of faith and dedication towards the divine. "   - - bapu says.. that but how do i do that.. when i can't even do good in school.. when alll i wanna do is truly "live" and everything seems to be holding me back.. evne some pushing me down..... *sigh* ...  raindrops  keep falling but i knowe some day the sun will be  shining .
