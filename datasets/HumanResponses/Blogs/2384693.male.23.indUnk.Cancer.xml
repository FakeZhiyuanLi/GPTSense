						   Once again I broke the promise I made to myself that I would go to the gym atleast 3 times this week. Its becoming a regular feature these days. Two months ago I was so religious about the gym and was so thrilled to have lost all my extra kilos (most of which are back now). Thoroughbred procrastinators like myself should think twice before paying gym memberships because gyms are simply not the best places for charity. For some reason I want to believe that gym membership cash wastage is a problem faced by umpteen IT workers. The skimpily clad, cute and well toned chicks that come to gyms/aerobics classes are perhaps the only motivation to wake up early and sweat it out. As months pass by, you realize that you are not going to get anywhere with any of those beauties, your interest in gyming declines exponentially and before long your rotundity returns, and the more painful I-am-wasting-hard-earned-cash guilt syndrome sets in.

						     Interesting Read     "But she is India's first and only glamorous female brand name, and that means something."     The " Maharani of Muck " is the best name somebody could think of for Shobha De.  Remember how she had commented on BJP's slogan "India Shining" as being similar to a boot polish commercial.  She just knows how to market the rubbish she writes. I agree, it indeed means something to sell shit to people and yet make them believe they are getting a good bargain.

						   Very recently I was unfortunate enough to have banged (rather just brushed) a more unfortunate lady (a certain Mrs. Asha Gaikwad) near Shivajinagar railway station. Mrs. Gaikwad who is a resident of a nearby chawl happened to feel like crossing the road at the precise moment that I happened to feel like taking a fast turn. Myself, my co rider and my bike were upright and safe while Asha fell on the road as a result of the minor collision. What ensued was the result of a (not well understood) phenomena wherein every other person on the road instantly transformed into a citizen who is passionately and obsessively concerned about the well being of the financially lesser privileged of the accident victims who happened to be Asha Gaikwad. Asha didn't have any visible signs of injuries except a slight lump on her head which was caused due to the impact with the road when she fell.  The people around frantically attracted other people (who weren't around) by providing exaggerated descriptions of how my bike hit the poor lady and how she flew and fell.  Now the situation demanded that I get the poor lady to sit in an autorickshaw and be taken to a nearby clinic for first aid. (A good portion of the crowd (apparently having nothing else to occupy themselves) chose to accompany us to the clinic). In situations where a dramatic display of public emotion is involved, doctors too like to have a piece of the pie and love to add to the drama in a very filmy style. On examining the patient, the doctor proclaims that though the lump on the head isn't serious it is advisable to get an Xray done (from a nearby hospital) to ensure that she didn't have any internal head injuries. The public was so thrilled to hear the doctors orders. They happily followed us to the nearby hospital as well. The scene at the hospital promised more drama. A junior doctor looks at the patient and declares that an Xray isn't required for such a slight and superficial injury. He quickly prescribes a couple of pills and we were all about to leave. Then comes in a senior lady doctor (who seemed to be more keen on inflating the situation). She explains to me (again in a very filmy style... by sending everyone else out of her room) that the patient has suffered a head injury and in any head injury she is required to keep the patient under observation for 24 hours and the lady needs to be admitted. Moreover the patient says she was hit by a bike and the doctor is going to have to inform to police about the matter. The people loved the doctor now... their excitement knew no bounds. One of the other ladies in the crowd spoke to Asha for sometime and came to declare that she had told Asha something the day before which Asha refuses to recollect, and that Asha had lost her memory. Now if all this wasn't enough, the others in the crowd started talking about how Asha needed to be kept in the ICU. The limit of my endurance was lost. I broke my silence, told the lady doctor (yelled rather) that she was creating unnecessary drama to stir up the sentiments of the people and that she had no right to take advantage of the goodwill I had shown by getting Asha to the hospital. I also gave a good piece of my mind (loudly) to some of the most vociferous people in the crowd (one of whom was badly inebriated). Asha expressed her wish to go home and not stay at the hospital and my anger paid off when the doctor decided to let go of everything with nothing but a prescription of painkiller and antibiotic pills. The crowd was silenced and Asha Gaikwad was sent home in an auto.

						   Neurological researchers are doing their best to collectively ruin the divine broth of the human psyche. These fellas have found out neurological explanations of pair-bonding in relationships, recently they happened to demonstrate that by playing around with a gene (relating with hormones vassopresin and oxytocin) they can convert a species of male rodents known to be extremely promiscuous and the Lotharios among the pan-dimensional beings we perceive as mice, into monogamous losers who mate only with one partner, take care of their mate as well as offspring and form (genetically-induced) emotional pair-bonds( urlLink news article ). They transformed virile voles into rodents who hold hands, rub shoulders, make breakfast, change nappies, do dishes, and remember anniversaries, in short equated them to the impotent pointing devices manufactured by Logitech.  This adds to the arsenal of traditional tools, like tears, eyes, voice and (lack of) clothing that womankind have successfully employed so far to manipulate (rather maneuver) the male thinking process (which works at sub-photonic rates and hence renders explicable using Newtonian mechanics contrary to the female counterpart which needs relativistic quantum mechanical considerations involving tensor calculus). It wont be too long before we will hear of neurologically-engineered long lasting marriages. Sushma Swaraj, Neena Gupta, Pooja Bedi, Rekha will soon be shouting slogans in parliament to increase subsidies on vassopresin inducing drugs (i.e. commitment pills).  The mice (pan-dimensional relatives of the voles) are inching closer and closer towards their goals. The neurologists would core dump looking at 101010 (binary for 42) but the mice know.. how to get their way!!

						    "Pretty girls have this power to turn Mary, making lambs out of people." --Ch.6. Five Point Someone, Chetan Bhagat   That remark refreshed an overflowing suitcase of memories, the kind which won't close unless all 75* kilos of yours truly sat on it.   * actual "figures" have been concealed for reasons better understood.

						   Can't wait to get home and lay my hands on Chetan Bhagat's  urlLink Five Point Someone . Bought it yesterday evening after reading some really good  urlLink reviews  and for just 95 bucks it was a steal.   Can't help but be bored with the drudgery of office, not that I don't have work to do but its what I mentioned before "I don't feel like it!", maybe its the approaching weekend that is enticing me, or maybe its the weather, or its simply a general puff of disinterest. In a conversation I had with someone in the company I had described the work here to lack considerable challenge(which led to an extensive debate), I had later wondered as to why did I have to say something like that. Today I totally agree with myself. Another colleague today mentioned to me that the problem with designing digital chips is that things get working without too much effort, problems faced are many but most (if not all) are pretty trivial.  Isn't it fun to find excuses to hate your work?   Today's lunch in office had rajma chawal.. and snacks had bhel, it isn't everyday that two of my favorites are served in a single day. Burrrp!!  The trek club has finalized on  urlLink Rohida  for this Saturday. I am hoping to have as much fun as I had in last years trekking season. The Sahyadris can exude immense life in the monsoon. Thick tropical vegetation, waterfalls, steep climbs on slippery paths, sweat, strong breeze, friends, jokes.. a trek is exactly what the doctor ordered to lift up my drooping spirits.  Why is Friday such a spoilsport?

						   Any commentary on the way typical Cancerians(like me) live and behave on this planet invariably mentions that the maxim a Cancerian is most likely to live by, while finding his way through the dark alley we call life is .... "I feel".  "I don't feel like it"... stands as a logically acceptable and highly understandable reason to not do something in my world. I find myself very confused when the world accuses me of being lazy.... I am not lazy, I just don't feel like doing somethings... thats all!! Why cant the world composed of mysterious beings born under even more mysterious sun signs understand this simple fact? I don't know if its true about most people ... I seem to feel more than I think and what is worse at times I cannot distinguish between the two. I know I am thinking in a negative way when I keep coming up with negative ideas and arguments about a situation in my head... but when I have a bad feeling... its just a feeling and isn't necessarily accompanied by thoughts. At times it becomes difficult to draw the line ... and it is at those times that I find myself devoid of any direction whatsoever. I have strong reasons also to believe that more than any form of education or professional experience.. I have learned and grown most because of what I feel. It might sound like a stupid example... the first time I burnt my hand as a kid .. I cried... but eventually I matured and can confidently work my way with things involving fire without the fear of getting burnt simply because I have lived the feeling of getting burnt... I have been there.. cried .. healed and forgotten it. Its this "Been there ... felt that" feeling that comprises the maturity with which I do things. I have learnt that whenever I have rejected my own feelings I have lost. Yes.... making a fool of myself in front of the whole school forgetting my speech midway.. did feel very bad. I couldn't gather the courage to go up on stage till the time I kept on rejecting the feeling of being insulted. It took me time to learn to live that feeling. Once I could live it... I no longer feared it.. I could go up on stage and say my speech.. perfectly knowing that if I goof up big time again.. I will feel terribly insulted... but well I now know how to live through that feeling. The important thing is to not brand a feeling as unwanted... you have to explore what it has to offer... believe me.. pain, disappointment and heartbreaks have as much to offer to the soul as the elations and joys. Emotions and feelings aren't hurdles (like most proponents of objectivity might claim)... I think one needs to flow with them and grow with the experience. I can put full faith in providence and people because I have learned to live the feeling when your faith is shattered, I am no more scared of being betrayed by anyone...cause if somebody does.. I know how to deal with it!! I can give and receive love easily cause I know how to actively deal with heartbreaks.  Logical Thinking never gives you reasons to live and love fully but Active Feeling does.

						    urlLink Bloomsday celebrates legacy of James Joyce - PittsburghLIVE.com   Today Bloomsday is celebrated to mark the legacy of James Joyce and his legendary novel  Ulysses . This novel enjoys perhaps the greatest patronage a work of English literature ever recieved. I happen to be among the unfortunate few to have wasted money to buy this early 20th century classic... and have given up on it a million times.  Reading this contrived work is like literar(ll)y untangling a spiders web. It is regarded as one of the most un-readable works in English. The satire links to contemporary Irish politics and other literary works with implied references. The story never starts never ends... just gets lost in the distracting style of Joyce's writings.  Please note the  urlLink Google  logo today which marks the occasion. It should soon be updated on their  urlLink logo collection .

						   Its has poured in Pune since yesterday like it never did in the last 3-4 years. I was stranded in office till late last night waiting for the showers to stop but had to finally give up and ride back home getting drenched. The days are back when roads are be-puddled and the merciless elite splash muddy waters on lowly two-wheeler riders. (They are subconsciously getting back at the two wheelers for creating nuisance on the streets and the signals during the rest of the year). No matter what sort of raincoat I manage to pull on ... in riding from NDA to Paxonet for a nice 30 minutes ... I am bound to get very wet with even a mild shower. This season makes me realize that the Indian middle class one-family-one-car model has failed miserably. My dads office(within the NDA campus) is just 2 kms away from home while I ride 25kms to get to Paxonet every morning!! But no reasoning can ever hold... because my dad loves his car and hates riding my bike. I CANNOT ... take the car nor crib about anything which hints (even in a roundabout way) in that direction.  I know Pune needs water and raining is a good thing.. but shouldn't we be investing in developing technology which can steer clouds away from urban settlements and go pour in the fields and the lakes??

						   "Those who use the free service will see capacity increase from 4M bytes to 100M bytes, while users of the fee-based service will get 2G bytes, the company said."   urlLink GMAIL  bashing has begun far before I had expected it to. I don't have a gmail yet but hey my Yahoo Inbox today showed me that I am using 3% of my 100MB mailbox. As for the change in interface I hardly noticed much improvement. I agree its changed... but its quite a change just for the sake of a change. But I still want a  urlLink gmail ..............and BAAADLY!

						   "Next Thursday, a rocket carrying a robotic explorer will launch, marking the start of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to land on a comet. The mission will take 10 years, with the lander making three fly-bys of earth and one of Mars before it reaches its destination, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in 2014."  Pretty neat!! They choose to name the mission Rosetta (which is the stone that helped to understand the Egyptian hieroglyphics.)  The comet has made favorable appearances in 1982, 1989 and 1996.

						    Popcorn Evening    Long time since we got a plain, clean, not-many-revolutionary-ideas type of love story which for a change isn't as boring as it could be. The storyline has many holes, Rani did look a wee bit plump(if not fat), the jokes were stale but nevertheless .... the movie holds it up. On the whole the film puts across its message, gets you to chuckle (if not laugh), does have an emotional current to it which can carry you away (again... just a lil bit...perhaps a little more if you happen to be female), carries your attention span through its entire length and does qualify as a prospective candidate for a good evening at E-Square (feels best when with family or girlfriend) worth the money and the popcorn.(Provided you don't analyze the movie too much.)  Now some fineprint.  Many parts of the story don't go down too well. The timeline of the story extends across many years and the transitions are very jerky. Just putting up a flash saying "3 years later" doesn't quite make you "feel" like the story has actually progressed by that measure of time especially when everybody looks just the same. Karan(Saif) and Reiea(Rani) are supposedly going to New York for higher studies, they roam around Amsterdam, Paris, New York and Mumbai in times which look highly modern, yet don't seem to know of modes of communication like email. They meet each other many times, always accidentally, always in a different corner of the world, always after gaps of years or months, and surprisingly always as close friends (the intimacy growing everytime). I would rather that they kept in touch and not be so surprised on bumping into each other. Agreed Saif and Rani were meant to fall in love..., but they take awfully long to do so.... at certain points one does feel like the story is pushing its luck too far with your patience. Abhishek Bachan has a guest appearance in a significant role whose significance is lost. He happens to be Rani's husband whom Rani deeply loved even after his death, but the chemistry and bonding between the two was never developed on the screen.... which if taken into perspective makes the rest of the story less palatable.  The jokes as I said were stale... but they were put across fairly well to make you laugh. Kirron Kher.. (Ranis mother) aka Umrao Jaan plays interesting comedy. I could relate very well with her typical Punjabi mother act. Saif too contributed to many chuckles. The animated HUM-TUM cartoon sequences though weren't funny ... but did a good job acting as imagery to enhance the import of the theme.  Saif didn't have six pack and in one particular shirtless number a few extra inches were showing... Rani too was looking a little fat. I mean Saif did look like a perfectly good looking man and Rani an attractive woman... but to be stars they could do without some kilos. The story did develop an emotional chemistry between the two pretty well but they failed on the sensual front. In a scene where they were supposed to make out... Saif could hardly get a grip of her waist ... I mean his hands seemed to be shivering... the kiss looked miserably fake. I know its a bollywood flick but hellooo.... a sensual scene is meant to be sensual. Saif is supposed to have a playboy kindof image in he story.....but he looked so scared when he made out...it seemed as if his wife was watching the shoot... or maybe Rani had warned him to keep his hands off. Another thing I noticed were the handfuls of cheeky references to sex ....  which were made using phrases like... "You know what I mean... Ding Dong." ......DING DONG..... I stood more than just amused!!!!  Rishi Kapoor makes a welcome appearance.... there is an interesting mention of Dimple and Bobby. It clicked well. Like all crappy storylines in the end Rishi Kapoor decides to reunite with his wife... for no apparent reason. I hate the way they wanna make everyone happy in a happy ending.... why cant they just make the main characters happy and leave the rest alone. Every character suddenly went lovey-dovey and happily ever after types in the end... which caused severe indigestion.

						     Book Review    With the extravagance of an American in a third world city and the distinction of an IITian among those of lesser brainpower,  “Five Point someone - What not to do at an IIT”  stands out in its reviews, and on bookstall shelves as a modern, well accepted and relished book. It is a story of three mediocre friends and their not so mediocre lives at the altars of India’s NRI manufacturing plant in IIT Delhi.  Chetan Bhagat’s novel is unquestionably entertaining and absolutely un putdown able but as a work of English fiction I would rate it amateur, at its best!! Chetan has provided wickedly funny insights into the lives of below average IITians but fails to blend the actual and the surreal. The aspects of his writing, which have drawn inspiration from actual experience decant out, leaving behind the immature and in ways stale, fiction. The modulations in detail with which he paints his characters and acts, are a dead giveaway of the fairytales.  The portrayal of Hari, Ryan, Alok and their trysts with the IIT system seem to come from the heart, elegantly developed and richly spiced, while Neha, Prof. Cherian and incidents surrounding them seem to have been pulled out of the compulsive desire to make a story.   Hari, is the narrator and not quite the main character (though he is supposed to be). He is honest and point blank, also political and populist at the same time. (It’s funny how he walks the rope) The narration is sprinkled with hilarious insights, which hold up the enjoyability of the read. The way he talks of Alok’s, bulletproof spectacles and UFO’s falling in the kitchen, a chuckle is guaranteed at every page. But he holds back a lot in terms of his belief system and his deeper perspectives. He speaks extensively about the others but not much about himself. Being the hero, his character deserved a more comprehensive treatment.   I shall run a  diff (Beyond Compare for Win) on Chetan Bhagat and Hari. In the preface Chetan says, “I have told my story, or have I?”, Hari narrates his story. Hari is always shy of admitting his true self in front of others and so is Chetan, because he doesn’t develop Hari’s character too deeply (hence recursively proved, Hari=Chetan). Hari’s viewpoint is always comic, he pretends to be Calvin. I strongly feel, the book, if made into a Nagesh Kuknoor film - a Rockford redesigned into an IIT - and Hari's insights being played in (Hum Tum style) Calvin and Hobbes animated sequences, would be a great blockbuster.  Bollywood masala was poured generously, sleeping with the HOD’s daughter, jumping off nine storied IIT buildings, hanging on roofs and sneaking into the HOD’s house is simply not what anybody can relate to. But yes the woes of being low-GPA five pointers are portrayed beautifully. The first person narrative is deviated from occasionally when important characters are given a chance to speak for themselves, the stunt pays off marvelously.  All in all, a decent first work from an IIT Delhi, IIM Ahemedabad, graduate settled in Hong Kong. I am sure he has earned more royalties from this book than he could have expected, and much more than he actually deserved

						   The Paxonet trek club spent most part of Saturday scaling the Rohida fort. After dealing with the agonies of consecutively snoozed alarms, the (all male) contingent of eleven took off in a well loaded Sumo at 730am. Breakfast was a light /idli/upma/poha at a tapri. I did feel like eating a little more but somehow chose to resist the temptation and jumped back into the Sumo to grab a snore on the drive. I could notice the absence of a few essential elements that go into making a good beginning for an enjoyable trek. To name a few, good prospects of rain, packed uttapas for lunch, a good collection of music, a bottle of chilled coke - of course to be diluted with two quarters of rum.   A quiet, breezy and yawnfull drive led us to a village called Bazarwadi near Bhor. I wouldn't say Bazarwadi was in the middle of nowhere, but yes it didn't amount to any more than a handfull of shacks which too didn't evoke anything close to a bazaar. The meager population of the area displayed an angle of sophistication by being avid dog lovers. Dogs here enjoyed an extra share of affection than I would consider usual from whatever of rural Maharashtra I have seen. At frequent strategic positions on the road, dogs could be seen royally perched, fearless, confident and more deaf to sound than any death metal fan. They seemed to be asserting their citizenship. (That they probably were issued voting cards as well, wouldn't surprise me.)  The base where we abandoned our vehicle, provided a view of the fort, which was partly breathtaking. Partly it contributed to the sordid realization that the time to inconvenience my lazy limbs had finally arrived. The fort didn't seem to be extremely far or anything, but being the first trek of the season meant atrophied and rusted trekking organs were going to take some screeching. We took directions from a local at the base who stood there (with his dog of course!) and started the climb.  The climb was a little tougher than I had expected it to be. Firstly it was mercilessly steep with little respite and secondly the wind wrecked havoc. No it wasn't a 'the-day-after-tomorrow-tornado' but it was the strongest breeze I had ever felt. Air force might seem to be too meek to cause trouble, but if you try and make a GI-Joe toy stand up on its feet, you can make it fall by blowing hard at it. We didn't fall like toys, but the air did quite a "blow" job to make the climb kind of tough. The fellas who fantastically lowered the average weight of the contingent, could stand leaning at almost 60-75 degrees with support from the wind. I for one, managed to get my spectacles flown off (luckily recovered unbroken). A particular horse among us (AJ as he is called) managed to race his adrenaline and reached the top much before anyone else. I am sure he didn't accomplish a lot, like he didn't grab the first come - first serve  hilltop beautiful princess, but he managed to do a good job of bashing some egos. My back would have broken or I would have manged a few slipped disks had the climb been just a few feet higher. Like all forts this one too had an entrance with stone steps, I painfully climbed them to see the remains of an historic fort, the finest view of the surrounding landscape, the freshest breeze and alaaaaaaaaaaas the much needed place to rest my  ass. The view from the stone embankments almost made me feel like Shivaji!! (a horseless Shivaji, that is)   The fort was fun to watch, like a different world, no people and no dogs as well!! There was this pole sporting a tiny orange flag, we did debate on the sheer pointlessness of the construction but AJ climbed the pole, probably humped it and performed pole dance while the others "gay"ly enjoyed, I too did climb the pole for a Kodak moment and no, I didn't hump it. (there was some point in the pole after all)   There was this little temple with stone walls and tin roofing (pointless again) which was way too dilapidated to visit. I do not want to say that people are disrespectfull but the inside of the temple did smell of concotions of uric acid. Water reservoirs were many, some nothing more than frog dwellings, some decent Jacuzzis and some that could qualify as swimming pools. The two digital cameras in our possession were given a run for their batteries with plenty of photogenic poses. The wind hadn't relented, when a Re. 1 coin would be thrown off the wall, it would fly back. I got extremely fascinated with the jig that I tried it way too many times and finally lost the coin.   The return journey was pretty easy and didn't take too long as well. I somehow don't recollect details of events which occur when I am hungry. Returning to the Sumo felt like a homecoming, the Sumo housed packets of pohe and idli which were relished thoroughly with the we-get-to-laze-again bon homie. As we ate, a herd of buffaloes passed by, they looked noticeably malnutrition-ed. I had a strong feeling that this village is full of jerks, all stray dogs are in the pink of health while cattle are skinny. As we left Bazarwadi, I stared back at the fort which happens to be named Vichitragad, the name perhaps being the only strange thing about the fort!!   We visited Baneshwar on the return, splashed around some waterfalls, noticed losers romancing with some non-males, and fanned the mood with a quarter of vodka. Trek endings feel sooo good, no its not the feel-good associated with a sense of accomplishment, its more to do with having an excuse to sleep throughout the Sunday!!

						   Personal postings seem to do so much more justice to my claim of torturing this page and its unfortunate readers with fractured philosophies, so here is another consecutive one.  Never before did yours truly spend the entire day in office genuinely engrossed in work. Walking around aimlessly, indulging in conversations which race on - steering clear from all forms of sensibility, hogging on biscuits, deriving entertainment from abusing Microsoft products, never before had failed their mission to invade my exponentially reducing attention spans. After two months, I paid a courtesy visit to my gym, and was bestowed with the “newcomer” treatment. It took courage but I managed to forego the snacks and carom festival in the evening to return home in broad daylight.  Yesterday was a day that shall go down the annals of lethargy as the day I desecrated my temperament.  Yesterday– I stumbled from the “Who-Cares-How-Many fold path” of carefree existence, my Garfield-hearted alter ego shriveled and, I caught  “The Cold”.   Of all the paraphernalia that Providence keeps handy,  “The Cold”  is His choicest weapon to jolt me into the realization that He endowed me with a body, which though copious needs to be nurtured. I don’t pray, don’t thank Him for all the wonderful things He gave me, like the nose, the nasal tract, the ability to breathe without being heard, the honor to live my life independent of the most feminine and crocodile-y of possessions – the handkerchief. He, merciless as nature, vainglorious of all His divine powers, demanding to be constantly remembered and thanked for every small thing (how womanly!!), harshly punishes me for my profanity.  Illnesses have their way of transforming me into what I want to be, and it scares me. I hadn’t realized that I possessed a set of teeth that require being cared for, until the day I sat on the devilish dentist’s chair. Similarly, when I had started to take my good fortune for granted, had given up caring for the changes in the weather, the air conditioner and his wicked mischief’s, my work, my life and the world at large, this cold has brought me back to my senses. My internal thermometers are suddenly alive and can sense with accuracy the surroundings, and above all can successfully trigger impulses, which make me wear warmer clothing. My arrogance is flattened and I am aware of my breathing organs and the redder than beetroot shade of my nose after surviving countless lashes from the kerchief. I no more find conversations, food, and carom interesting and am happier engrossed in work because it helps me take my mind away from the anguish.

						   There are these things about me, which are so much a part of me and have remained that way even after years of my denying them or trying to do away with them. During the long personal talks that I usually engage my friends in, I mention, "You know, I used to be the kind of person who...", and deep within I hate myself for lying, because I know, I still am that kind of person.  I outwit my concience. Brilliantly accept and reject myself simultaneously. I used to be that way till yesterday or till 5 minutes ago, but now I have changed, I am not going to repeat that pattern again. A promise that can be shattered a million times, and still not be declared broken.

						      Troy , the legendary city with sixteen feet wide impregnable walls, its shephard prince Paris, his love for a woman, the Trojans who fought for that love, a thousand ships, many thousand swords-spears-shields-sandals, Achilles versus Hectar, the horse, the fall of Troy, Brad Pitt, Coke – Sandwich combo, two hours, 110 bucks, INOX – Love the movie!!   The movie puts itself across as a mammoth directorial effort. Main characters were many, each having an intricate personality, which demanded to be patiently chiseled. Achilles - a stubborn invincible warrior, who is born to fight but would rather not. Hectar - a gallant of great honour, who has to choose between his pragmatism and the fancies of his family. Paris – a lovelorn wimp, who makes claims as tall as the walls of Troy and as hollow as the pride of Sparta. Agamemnon – someone you have to love to hate. Odysseus – king of Ithaca, a valiant with bonus grey matter and the skill to deal with the tantrums of Achilles. King Priam – the courageous king of Troy who loves his family and fears his gods.  The many remarkably portrayed, intense and involved scenes included, the climatic sword duel between Achilles and Hectar, the melodramatic dialogue where a father begs Achilles to allow burial rites for his dead prince, and the siege of Troy. To pack all these goodies with just the precise stress on each, simultaneously pandering to audience cravings for gore, sex and charged dialogues undoubtedly takes mighty skill.  Skill apart, conglomerating too many spices in one dish, evaporates the magnificence of the story being told. The delicacy of each character and event seems somewhat overshadowed by an effort to please everyone in the audience. Tailoring a popular movie over the skeletons of a great epic renders the original  “Iliad”  almost raped.  Brad Pitt and the other gallant men in the cast have been made to  sculpt their bodies into those of real Greek warriors – which I would regard as a gross human rights violation. My gym instructor would be ashamed of himself looking at them. As for the women, I had to TRY hard to find them attractive, all of them violating WHO minimum dietary recommendations. Right from Brad Pitt, the effeminate looking King Priam (bearing strong semblance to the old lady who narrates  “Titanic”  and plays the aged Kate Winslet), to Hectars baby boy, most male characters had deep green eyes, and I am not ashamed of saying that I did find them very beautiful. I am also not ashamed of pointing out that the horses used were extremely handsome, especially the thoroughbred black stallions on Achilles chariot who splendidly arch their necks and lift their feet high while trotting.  Lastly, the movie diverts from the original epic big time,  urlLink here  is a short outline of the actual mythology surrounding the Trojan War.  As for trivia, Homers sequel to  Iliad ,  The Oddysey  is a description of the wanderings of Odysseus after the war, and is the primary inspiration of James Joyce’s modern classic  Ulysses !!!  *For the uninformed, the Spartan family of Xilinx FPGA devices inspires the title of the post.

						   Sorry for the consecutive senti posts!!  A Secret:  There is this human being. I was about 15 years old. In front of fifty people he was asked to name one person in this world he hated most. He named me. Every time I see him, a part on the inside of my head screams, a part that got in from nowhere, doesn't grow, doesn't shrink either. It kinda pricks the other parts all the time.  To see this person though, is something I have do almost everyday. I tried a lot, but amnesia eludes me. If memories be food to hatred, may I have none.

						       All the world is a stage.    One loony performer has set unbroken records for goof ups and bloopers. A faux pas specialist he is. Last few days have seen me in retrospect. Looking back at the all those years that I have been. At the cues I missed and the lines I forgot. Last few days, I have been devoutly memorizing all my blunders. Leaving absolutely nothing for the last minute.    The curtain is gonna fall soon, you see.      Life has these somewhat unkempt crossroads, which are inaptly noxious. You are to leave behind a part of yourself, to move on to a future. Which you wishfully assume will be bright, brighter than all Made in India tube lights. Where shadows dare.  Life in The Occident they say is fast, very fast. It is like an expressway all along. The slow, maudlin, third world and South East Asian memories can never chase you there. Over there, they say, time is an epitome of frugality.  It flies like the F16s, saves you lots of thinking, saves you lots of loneliness. Saves daylight as well.   There is going to be a new stage, a new curtain, and a fresh plot.    These roads are in no way less traveled; the traffic islands though, are virgin soil.  I have some loved ones. They urge me to frequent the shopping malls. I have to be prepared, well equipped with all I could possibly need. I have to take all I can.  Something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.   Twenty-three years in two suitcases. It is time to wrap up my act.   Will the new audience laugh at me when I forget another line, or will they pelt stones at me?   I have a home. My records of blunders, define me. I have this wonderful relationship with my life. I goof up and it laughs at me. Calls me a clown. Don’t tell anyone, but I like it. I enjoy it. I feel safe here. I feel loved here.  I am going there, where the sky is the limit, where the cars are fast, the girls are pretty, the buildings stand tall, opportunities are many, reservations there are none, I can almost smell the success and my mind visualizes beautiful days ahead.  My heart weeps and my soul cringes.  My relationship is in its last leg.  37 more days to live.

						     Inspired from a  urlLink discussion  about Murphy’s laws on  urlLink Saket’s blog , I was reminded about an  urlLink AWAD  listing that had overwhelmed my imagination.   urlLink Resistentialism , is a school of thought, that explains why the toast always falls the buttered side down. It propounds that; all “things” in the Universe are against human endeavors. It rains the day you chose to wash your car; shoelaces always break when you are in a hurry; the pencil falls from your desk only to sit where it is most difficult to retrieve.   A preliminary analysis involving high school physics would suggest that, since we place a toast the buttered side up on the table, when it falls, due to the height of the table, and the characteristic rotation imparted, the toast will fall the buttered side down. Had the table been higher by a few feet, the toast would complete a rotation to fall the buttered side up. But it is worth noting, why dinning tables are only so high? Because humans are only so tall, and why are humans only so tall? A theory of evolution suggests that the average height of a human is governed by the instinct to protect the skull from damage. Had we been 8 feet tall, a minor fall could have fractured our skulls, and so have we evolved to be only as tall as we are. But then why are skulls only as strong? The answer lies in the strength of molecular bonds, which in turn are governed by the constants of electromechanical forces, which were fixed just a few seconds after the big bang. Thus, the universe was wired to make the toast fall the buttered side down.  The theory of  urlLink Graduated Hostility of Things , evolving from Clarke-Trimble experiments, corroborates this metaphysical phenomenon. During an experiment, toasts with marmalade were randomly dropped on carpets of varying exclusivity. The percentage of toasts that fell marmalade side down was found to be in exact proportion to the value of the carpet. Toasts would spare the cheap rags, and prefer to stain the silk carpets more.  I faintly remember a forward doing rounds, which had an interesting proposition. Since a cat always lands on her feet and the toast falls the buttered side down, if we tie a buttered toast to a cats back and suspend them, both forces will try to land their way on the floor and we can have a perpetual motion machine!! What say?

						   The day I was born into a Punjabi family, I was denied the bliss of adorning a living being in flesh and blood with the title of,  My First Love . If a Punjabi ever showed you a picture of his first girlfriend or wife and said,  "She is my first love" , he is lying. Walk on the streets of my hometown Chandigarh, all those spherical bundles in salwar kameez, those men who conceal their valor and steel-grit in thick layers of flesh and hair, all of them were nobody's first love. It is not that Punjabis love people less, but -like a loud burp- as it may sound, they love food more. Always and every time. As an infant, I too was forcibly pushed to fall in love with, Aloo Parathas made with desi ghee and garnished with a hand grenade sized blob of butter. It is a love that has stayed with me since and never ebbed. The parathas are closer to my heart than anything and anyone. Whenever I have visited north India, I have learnt important lessons in life. Work, studies, principles, values are important, very important, but one must never forget the central theme of life.  Living is meaningless without doodh, lassi, malai, and ghee. They are the pillar stones of happiness. If you have nothing else, you can be happy with just these.    "Naani, what are we going to do today?"  "Today Beta, we will make gobi parantha for breakfast, samosas with tea, chole bature for lunch, kachori in the evening, and butter chicken for dinner."     Life is simple. It has two phases. First you cook. Second you eat.  The rest. Are details!

						   The uncertainty, which conspires to loom relentlesly over my Swedish residence permit, has rendered me as a sterile employee of my company. I don’t qualify as a person who can be blessed with something to do. They fear I may not stay to complete what I start, unless the Swedish Migration Board does another round of Swedish thinking and Swedish letter writing, for me to stay back. The&nbsp;question I am faced with is, "What to do in office?" Please email your suggestions to  urlLink  transitions_have_tentacles@each_of_them_suck.com   .    I feel like a popular pistol-smart and  rampuri  adorned underworld  Bhai . I have a  supari  contract with me. The victim though is no lowly mortal.  Approximately 8 of them are required to be throttled, shot point-blank, drowned, pushed off the terrace, and gassed everyday, what is worse, each and every one&nbsp;of them gives me a tough fight. Hours are no easy victims.  The beauty of the whole process is that onlookers, co-workers and co-idlers have zero clue about the diurnal bloodbath that consecrates my cubicle.

						      India as a motherland oozes super glue. It is sticky. Doesn’t let you leave, both sentimentally and also VISA-mentally.  Never in my wildest of dreams had I thought, that I would have to go one-on-one the face of tragedy, in a classic slip between the cup and the sip.  More than a month after my VISA application, a couple of days after reading a  på svenska&nbsp; objection letter in highly ornate Roman script, minutes after a harrowing round of running around and struts down diplomatic aisles, I sit awaiting the fate of my international study plans, albeit in second iteration.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  på svenska = in Swedish

						       I am dumb, because the anesthesia hasn’t worn its effect off my oral cavity as yet. I am dumber because I have parted with a cherished eating organ and subjected my feeble wisdom resources to an unfortunate dental attrition this morning.  The wisdom tooth was diagnosed to be crooked. Later it was prescribed to be extracted, under the wicked garb of prophylactic treatment.  I can’t help but think about how much he must be missing his molar friends in that dentist’s waste bucket.   The dentist had said, “Just lay back and relax, you wont feel a thing. Nothing will happen to you”. He put me under a medical spell and numbed my consciousness. Minutes later he showed me the calcite mortal remains. The tooth. “Nothing will happen to you”, BULLSHIT, that red thing was blood… and that dear tooth.  He is dead.   We as humans should learn to be&nbsp;somewhat more sympathetic towards the differently oriented. You too would support gay-lesbian movements, if you would see a beloved tooth of yours being extracted.  A tooth that was as toothy as the others, and suffered this horrendous predicament simply because he wasn’t straight!!!

						     INOX the grand Puneri Multiplex was at its spider studded best and generously embroidered with artificial cobwebs, to mark the first day of Marvel comic’s, runner-up marvel, Spiderman 2. Bhavna and I were among the early insects to have webbed two first day tickets on Friday evening. We rendered not very spoilt, a cloudy, mercury dipped, drizzly and date-perfect evening.  All the characteristic wall climbing and web slinging, is genuinely not very appealing for a second viewing, however the sequel seems to present itself with a more anthropoid face than an arthropod one. Peter Parker, our very own next-door pizza delivery boy has a life after all. He likes to be normal like everyone else, likes to uncork all those bottles of emotions, confess his love to Mary Jane, let people see the face behind the mask, and in his own words, to change into a man, the kind that bleeds when punched. A circus of human beings with their ordinary lives and confused affections cannot be called a Spiderman movie without a wholesome topping of overhead trapeze acrobatics and a couple of bad guys. The movie does more than its bit to live up to that. The toppings of course, were as hard to swallow as could be expected.  Mary Jane (Kursten Dunst), temporarily gets over Toby’s head hanging down and mask halfway up poignant kiss (from Part –I), she dismisses her crush on long time friend Peter, moves on with her new life and a new love, her feelings for Peter though are still a complicated web waiting to be untangled. Peters dilemma of living a Spiderman existence saving other peoples lives while losing his own, lost jobs, neglected academics, the pain of losing his love to an astronaut, the agony of his aunt, and his failed efforts at not being an empty seat, is another intricately woven web. The bad guy, Dr. Otto Octavius with his doomed experiments of implementing controlled nuclear fusion, was spidery in his own way, thanks to the 4 mechanical limbs to add to 4 natural ones.  To look at it on the whole, there were strands that were stupid and strands that were entertaining, this web isn’t incapable of netting quite a few mindless insects. Toby fits his role, like he fits the Spidey suit, Kursten looks pretty and acts well, the action, the noise at every occasion succeeds in causing women to wrinkle their countenances, clench their fingers and dig them into other peoples arms.  There isn’t a lot more to ask for!!!

						    Seems that the wrath of the Gods    Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;    I think I might be sinking. -Led Zeppelin (Going to California)   In the last few days, the number of possible locations a person can be in Pune shrunk to only two. First you could be at The Café Coffee Slush, if not there, you could be indoors. Every pair of feet and every rubber tyre have been reveling their time splashing around in omnipresent streams of Mochachillo and Frappe.  The Barista outlets in heaven are having some plumbing problems, especially that part of heaven, which hovers right above Pune.
