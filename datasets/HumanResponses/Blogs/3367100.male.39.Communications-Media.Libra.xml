      You know, the music teacher at my kid's elementary school is a dear, dear woman, but I question her thinking sometimes.  Yesterday afternoon I spent almost an hour with my wife, two youngest boys, my daughter, my mother-in-law, and probably 100 other kids and family members watching a school music program in a church parking lot, in 90 degree weather, cooking like a steak on the asphalt of the parking lot.  Now, this morning, I'm being aggravated by the sunburn I aquired.  To top it off, I cooked out last night for my father-in-law's birthday and didn't have a chance to shower last night or this morning(okay, I could have showered this morning if I'd pulled my lazy butt out of bed early enough), so I smell like a bar-b-que.  Oh well, I guess it could be worse, I could just stink.

      Here are the contest particulars... Beginning Monday morning, 5/24, there will be a voucher hidden somewhere in the Clovis area that you need to find and bring to the KKYC studios at 10th and Sycamore to redeem for the pair of Shania Twain tickets.  Beginning Monday morning we'll begin giving clues to the location of the voucher.  At the end of each day I will post the day's clue here.  The person who finds the voucher and brings it to the studio will win a pair of 15th row tickets to Shania Twain June 26th in Lubbock.  Good hunting!!

      Yes, today is the day advocated in an e-mail making the rounds to boycott and don't buy any gas.  My thought is that only hurts the little guy here in Clovis who owns the stores(okay, maybe not Allsups).  My thought is if you DO plan to not buy gas today as a protest, still stop in the local convenience stores and buy a drink or a bag of chips or something.  Don't punish a store owner that is just as much at the mercy of the supplier as we are, maybe even more so.  What do you think?

      Been a long day, gonna pack it in and head to Casa Daniels.  Maybe I can get more than 4 hours of sleep tonight.  Just found out that there are Van Halen tix still available for the Lubbock show in September, and they're cheaper than I was told they would be.  Maybe I can still get the wife to go, but she said she'd go if I went with her to see Jessica Simpson in Lubbock in July.  Is the trade worth it?  I think so, may be the final chance to see the VH boys.

      Well, overslept this AM, but got the day back on track.  Typing is tough this morning because I'm injured.  Took a line-drive off the pinky finger playing softball last night and now I'm whining about it.  I'm a whiner, what can I say?  WAAAAA!  I'm posting this here first, before it makes it on the air...Listen starting Thursday morning at 7:20 and I'll start giving the details on our contest for the Shania Twain concert tickets.  And don't be surprised if I post those details here BEFORE then.

      I want to welcome everyone to my blog.  Who am I?  Well, since you are here you probably know who I am, but just in case you blundered in by accident, here goes.  I'm Joe Daniels, and I am the Operations Manager for KKYC-FM and KICA-AM & FM in Clovis, New Mexico.  I'm also the morning dude on KKYC and the afternoon dude on KICA-FM.  I have an incredibly tolerant wife and 4 beautiful children that are my entire life.

      You know, I'm not a fan of the Buffaloes or their head football coach Gary Barnett.  He's a putz on a good day.  At best he's an insensitive jerk, and at worst he knows about and has condoned rape.  He should have been fired for the insensitive comments he made about the rape accusations made by 9 women, and the rape allegations levelled by Katie Hnida, who tried to be a kicker for the Buffaloes, and eventually transfered to UNM and became the first woman to score in a men's Division I football game.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, when told about alegations by Hnida made in a Sports Illustrated article that she had been raped by a teammate while at Colorado, Barnett said, "Well, she wasn't much of a player anyway".  Colorado got a blackeye in all this, and then yesterday poked their eye out by reinstating Barnett.  Barnett stayed because he usually wins.  Who wants to bet if the team goes 3-8 or 2-9 this season, Barnett is looking for a new job?  And even sadder, who wants to bet he's not looking long?

      Why do we pronounce Wednesday with a silent "d"?  Anyway, apologies for being late this morning.  Was getting ready about 5:35 when the wife called out to me and said Zachary, our almost 2 yeaqr old, was burning up.  He's had to fever induced seizures since last October, and the one in March left him in the hospital for a week, so as you might imagine, the thought of any fever at all kinda freaks us out.  So, I stayed until I was pretty sure he was ok.  We think he was just real hot because he slept all night wrapped up in his favorite goosedown blanket.  Probably not the blanket he needs to use during the hotter part of the year huh?  Search For Shania clue #3 on the way before 10.

      Oldhippie1, the smell was actually pork chops and hot dogs, but fortunately I got to shower over the weekend.  Speaking of which, weekend was good and busy.  Hosted our annual "School's Out" party for our kids.  Normally we plan for 40 or 50 and have 2 show up, but this year we invited our church too, and since we're Baptists and there was food, and Baptists really like to eat, we had a full back yard.  Then I spent all of yesterday afternoon trying to set up a swimming pool that is supposed to be ready for water in 30 minutes.  2 Hours later when I started filling it with water, I realized 10 year olds think "ready for water in 30 minutes" actually means "ready to swim in in 30 minutes".  They forget the part about "takes 8 hours to fill up with water so you can swim".  I'm just glad my 8 year old was over at her grandparents so I only had to hear it from one impatient child.  "Search For Shania" is officially underway!  Glad I was able to hide the voucher at midnight last night without getting arrested.  Listen through the day today for the first clue.  I'll post the clue each day here on the blog, so you'll be able to get it in cased you miss it oon the air.  I'll actually post it and add it to the list of clues, so each successive post will have every clue so you can see them all together.  Might help you out seeing them all together.  Ain't I nice?

      Not long ago I was sitting at a stop light here in town, and a Cadillac Escalade pulled up next to me.  Now, I was sitting in my Ford Expedition, which I consider a pretty kick ass vehicle, even though it's a 97 model, so it's a few years old.  But still, Expeditions are pretty dang nice.  But an Escalade is an Escalade, right?  Anyway, I noticed the back wsindow of the Escalade was dirty, and had some doodlings in the dirt, but even more, some bird had decided to make this Escalade it's personal outhouse.  And it occured to me, no matter your social status, no matter how classy a vehicle you drive, bird's don't care, they will still crap all over it.  Kinda sums up life, if you ask me.  Also have a cocroach in the hallway ooutside the studio door this morning, obviously not feeling too well.  Don't know if heate too much crap or what, but he's on his back and not kicking too much.  I haven't stepped on him yet, though, as much as I'd like too.  No, it's not pity...it's not wanting cockroach guts on the bottom of my shoe.

      Can you believe it?  If someone had told me we'd hit the 100 degree mark for the first time June 2nd, I would have said, right, sure we will.  But it happened.  At 4 yesterday afternoon, it was 100 at Cannon Air Force Base.  100 degrees!  And it's still 3 weeks til Summer officially begins.  So, hot enough for ya?

      You ever get up and almost immediately you know it's going to be one of those days?  Welp, today is one of those days.  Hopefully I have things back together and things will return to a semblance of normalcy.  Thanks COurtney for the posts.  The path ih that last clue was kind of a double clue, although it was meant more to mean the walking path.  However, one of the clues for this week was going to be "Follow the pathway", referring to CCC's old slogan "Pathway to your future"(which, as an aside, when I first got to Clovis almost 10 years ago and heard for the first time, I thought said "halfway to your future"...I know, I'm not always too sharp).  Congratulations on winning the tickets, and sorry I didn't get to meet you and your husband in person.  Thanks for listening and playing!

      Exercise your democratic right and get out and vote!  OK, just because someone found the Shania voucher doesn't mean the blog is closing down.  Oh no!  The blog will continue forward.  It existed before the search, and it will continue long afterward.  And speaking of the search, where was the voucher?  I know you're all dying to know.  Well, it was at Clovis Community College, at the track, taped to the underside of a cement bench at the west end of the track.  I still haven't at this point had the winner come in and claim the tickets, but the business office is justg now opening, so I expect her to arrive any minute.  I'm dying to know which of the 5 very vague(I thought...shows what I know) clues gave it away for her and her husband.  I'll let you know....

      I can't beleived someone found the voucher already!  I am amazed that someone could find it from those clues.  I would never have thought to look where it was hidden from the 5 clues from last week.  Where was the voucher hidden, you ask?  Well, I'll finally reveal that Tuesday morning on the air after the winner comes by the studio to claim the tickets.   Hope everyone has a safe and happy Memorial Day.  Remember today why we have Memorial Day every year.  Go lay flowers on the grave of a veteran you don't know, and of course on the ones you do.  And say a prayer for all the men and women fighting right now in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And remember, if you're celebrating with a few libations, don't drink and drive.

      First of all, let me say I am not immune to the pain the family of the woman tragically killed last July 4th in a police pursuit here in Clovis.  That being said, I am curious.  I see in an article in our local "newspaper" that her family has filed a lawsuit against the city, and the former Clovis police officer involved, for being negligent.  The point I question is not whether they were or were not, because I have no idea.  What I do wonder is why the person who is responsible for the pursuit, the person who crashed into and killed the woman, the person who, if he had not run from the police, would not have caused the death of the woman, why is the family not suing him as well?  Is it because he has no money should they prevail in their lawsuit?  How can he bare no responisibility?  Had he pulled over as he should have when the police officer attempted to stop him, none of this would have happened.  So why is it solely the responsibilty of the city and the former officer?  Again, why is the person who ran not named as well in this lawsuit?  Maybe it's because he doesn't have $750,000, or insurance that is kept for just such an instance as this that will probably eventually settle?  Makes one wonder...

      You know, I have been here at the radio station for almost 10 years now, and for that entire time the trash can in the kitchen area has been in the same place.  Yesterday, for some unknown reason, they moved it.  Now, I realize this is a small thing, but why did they have to move it?  What was wrong with the space where it has been since I got here?  Was it something mandated by OSHA?  Had it become a hazard where it was?  Or did someone just feel the overwhelming urge to screw with stuff?  Or is this part of the ongoing great conspiracy here to drive Joe crazy?  If that's the case, I ain't got far to go.  Man, glad I don't own an automatic weapon.

      The Tampa Bay Lightning are the Stanley Cup Champions!  My new favorite team took the cup with a 2-1 win over the Calgary(Alberta, Canada...Lance Storm, anyone?) Flames last night.  Now I really don't have anything personal against the Flames, but the Lightning have been a laughing stock in the NHL for so long I just had to root for them.  Plus, as long as a Canadian team doesn't win the cup, I'm happy.  Hey, it's a friendly rivalry wit da Great White Nort, but it is s a rivalry.  I don't know how many, if any, people are actually checking out this blog, but if you are, let me know, ok?  Take a couple minutes to register with blogger.com so you can post comments.  Any comments.  I just am looking for some feedback, whether it's about the blog, my posts, the radio station(either one, KKYC or KICA), or just life in general.  This is a good place to get hold of me if I'm not on the air, obviously.  Want me to play a request tomorrow morning?  Make a comment on here, and more than likely I'll see it in time to get it on for you the next day.  Heck, I might even see it in time to get to it today.  Give it a shot.  What, you actually have better things to do while you're sitting at work, surfing the net?

      by the weekend passing of the greatest president in our country's recent history.  President Ronald Reagan was a great American, and I am sad to hear of his death.  It seems hard to believe that it had been 10 years since he announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer's.  He had been so much out of the public eye that it was easy to forget that, I guess.  I can only think of one thing that I wish Ronnie hadn't done, and that is the deregulation of the broadcast industry.  That has resulted in all the bland, cookie cutter, sucky radio you hear across the country.  Kinda scared me that Ronnie thought a nuclear war was winnable, but you know what?  If Ronnie had been president, Afghanistan would have been nuked, and I'm not sure that would have been a bad thing...

      Well, on one hand I am glad to see the Supreme Court tell this putz Michael Newdow to go home, but on the other I am disappointed they didn't make a stand and tell him to permanently go away, that "One nation, under God"  does not violate the seperation of church and state.  I mean, George Washington himself said the blue in our flag represented Heaven.  And where does it say that a person that is an athiest HAS to say that part anyway?  I could come closer to understanding their argument if they were required by law to say it, but they are not.  They're not even required to say the pledge.  But instead, the Supreme Court said he couldn't sue to have that phrase removed on behalf of his daughter because he doesn't have custody of her.  While that is true, why did they take the easy way out and leave the door open for him or some other moron to bring it up again?  One of these days they'll have to rule on it on the basis of seperation of church and state, and I guess all we can do is hope they make the right ruling....

      If you have logged on here recently looking for some pearls of wisdom, or something remotely enlightening or even mildly humorous, my apologies.  I just have not been feeling the mojo of late.  Been out of sorts for some reason.  I think I'm getting too much sleep.  I know, sounds odd, but I am at the point, after almost 10 years of being here and on the air by 6 am almost everyday, that I seem to function better on about 4 hours of sleep.  And I love to sleep, so that really sucks.  But, see, just now I had a thought that seemed worth putting down on the screen, but it slipped away.  And I can't get it back.  ARGH!  Plus, I can't get rid of this damn phlemg!

      It never ceases to amaze me how unproductive I can be when I set my mind to it.  I've worked a lot this week, but I still feel like I haven't accomplished a thing.  And now it's the weekend, where you aren't supposed to accomplish anything.  I should be going to visit my parents and brothers in Borger, but don't feel like I can get away this weekend.  Plus, our two youngest aren't feeling well.  Hopefully they are feeling better this morning.  Haven't heard from the better half yet this morning, which should be a good sign.  Hope it means they haven't gotten up and woke her up yet.  So, do 2 year olds normally puzzle out things?  I'm referring to our 2 year old, Mr. Furious, who yesterday for 2 hours tried everything he could think of to circumvent my rule that he not get in our swimming pool as he is too short to not drown without help.  He drug every chair, toys, rock, you name it, to the edge of the above ground pool and tried to climb in.  I'd get rid of one thing, he'd look around until he found something else.  And you could just see the wheels spinning in his little pointed head.  It amazes me.  Plus, I think he's a mutant.  I've never seen a 2 year old that could pick up a 32 inch TV, but if he could get his arms around it, the little turd would lift it up.  The only thing keeping him from doing it is that one fact, his arms are just too short to get around the TV enough for leverage.  He can lift either end with no problem.  Amazing.

      So the terrorists in Saudi Arabia have beheaded another American.  How do we handle this?  How do we stop this?  For years, I have said the way to stop planes being hijacked was the next time some group of terrorists hijacked a plane, we blow it up.  Yes, that would also kill all the passengers on board, but do you think any more hijackers would be lining up any time soon to hijack a plane?  Not all the terrorists are in such a hurry to go see allah as the ones on 9/11.  So, back to the question of how to handle the current crisis of Americans being kidnapped, and then beheaded when demands aren't met to release captive al-Quida members.  First of all, don't suggest, REQUIRE that all Americans in Saudi leave the country.  Secondly, what we should do THIS MINUTE is take every captive that the terrorists were demaning be released before they beheaded Paul Johnson and behead them.  They are making the rules, maybe it's time we started to play by them.

      So the price for the life of a 2 week old girl is now 14 years, eh?  If you haven't heard, the individual that crashed his semi into he back of a car near Elida last August, killing the 2 week old daughter of the couple inside, was sentenced to 14 years in prison.  He admitted having been drinking and fled the scene of the accident on foot.  HE KILLED A 2 WEEK OLD GIRL AND HE ONLY GOT 14 YEARS IN PRISON!  No wonder our justice system has become such a joke...

      Went last night to the midnight premiere of Spider-Man 2.  I have been looking forward to the release ever since I heard the date.  My wife actually accused me of being more excited about the release of the movie than I was about getting married.  Not true, but I was excited and looking forward to it.  Then, as it got closer to midnight, I started to get apprehensive about going to see it.  What if I don't like it?  What if it doesn't live up to the hype?  Sequels are NEVER as good as the first movie.  Well, in this case, it is.  It was worth not getting to bed until nearly 3 and having to be at work at 6.  Doctor Octopus was very cool.  It didn't seem to me that there was as much fight action between Spider-Man and Doc Ock as there was with the Green Goblin in the first one, and I'm not sure if that was an effort to focus more on Peter Parker, or because the Doc Ock special FX were more expensive.  It was cool none the less.  So, who is the villian going to be in the thrid installment, which they have already announced will be made?  Will it be Harry as the new Green Goblin?  Maybe he'll be Hobgoblin.  Or, could it be The Lizard, since they introduced Dr. Connors in this one?  Or perhaps Man-Wolf, John Jameson, the son of J. Jonah Jameson, who stole the show again in his scenes, which thankfully there were more of this time.  Guess we'll have to wait 2 years to find out, as I hear it is a VERY closely guarded secret.  HMMM, maybe they'll use Venom...  On another note, who's running the property formally known as Lucky Dog here?  Is it the city?  I ask because as I was driving in to work this morning at 6, after the good rain we got last night, the sprinklers were on full blast all over the property.  So much for the Stage 1 water restrictions the city and the water company want us to adhere to...

      Something bothers me about the 14 year old that killed his father, stepmother, and stepsister on Sam Donaldson's ranch near Hondo.  Something other than the fact he killed someone, other than the fact he killed his father.  It bothers me that a 14 year old, abused or not, thinks that is an acceptable way to handle the situation.  Our culture of violence has taught kids it's okay to handle a situation like that in this manner.  And it also bothers me that everyone seems to know the boy was being abused, and either didn't or couldn't do anything about it.  And now they all seem to be of the opinion that it is ok he killed his own father, as well as his stepmother and stepsister, because he was abused.  Does that make it ok to kill your own father?  To kill anyone?  I don't know, but it bothers me that we seem to think automatically that it does.

      Haven't posted anything in a week, and it's because not much has happened, I guess.  But since I have this blog, I feel the overwhelming need to post SOMETHING, no matter how boring.  Actually, last Friday was pretty exciting.  We had a great day on our rock station selling gas for an hour for only 98 cents.  It was a madhouse, which is exactly what we wanted.  Got a lot of attention, although we didn't get the newspaper coverage we had hoped for.  Oh well, can't have everything.

      Someone please explain to me how someone can become so far gone as to set their 3 children on fire, along with their mother and themselves?  If you didn't hear, a guy in Seattle poured gas on himself and his ex-girlfriend and their 3 children, ages 6 months, 1 1/2 and 2 1/2, as they were driving down the road.  The car then crashed and he jumped out, on fire, and started firing guns.  He and the kids died at the scene, the woman lived for 8 hours and was able to tell authorites what happened.  She had recently filed assault charges against the man.  I have 4 children, ages 10, 8, 2, and 6 months.   I can't even fathom a situation where I would intentionally do something like that to them.  They are the most important things in my life.  Anyone who tried to harm them I would kill with no hesitation and no remorse.  How could I possibly injure or kill them?  I could never be that far gone.  Or evil.  I realize the Bible says all sin is the same in God's eyes, and hell is as hot for one soul as another, but being human, I can't help but hope their is a little hotter corner of hell for this person, and people like him.  And I pray the children were asleep and never knew what happened, just woke up in Heaven.

      I'm not even sure where to begin, because nothing of really extreme significance has occured, yet a lot of significant things have happened.  Had my 2 year old's birthday party finally last night, almost a month after his birthday.  We had a party for him on his birthday up at the lake, but this was the big cookout bash birthday party that all the friends and more family got to come to.  It was hot dogs for about 25 people.  And a huge Spider-Man birthday cake.  My wife was leary of getting such a big cake, and then was very glad she talked herself into it.  Had a Spider-Man pinada too, one that was the head and shoulders of Spidey.  The kids didn't so much break it open as they decapitated poor ol' Spidey, and when that happened my son went into hysterics.  Didn't handle seeing his hero decapitated too well.  But after he realized Spider-Man was full of candy, he was better about it.  We also found out that he's now tall enough to stand in our swimming pool and not be below water.  I don't know if that is good or bad.  I say that because on one hand it's good...if he manages to get outside and into the pool by himself(which he is very capable of doing), then he shouldn't drown...the bad thing is it takes away his fear of the pool, which has been the only thing keeping him from climbing into the pool by himself.  If he does that, even though he can stand up and have his head well out of the water, if he slips  and goes under, he might panic only being 2 and not realize all he has to do is stand up.  Sometimes, fear is a good thing.  He has none what so ever.  My 2 year old has a lot of "Hey, y'all, watch this" in his future, I am afraid.

      First, starting Monday morning I will begin doing a tried and true radio thang,  called "Pick It or Flick It".  You know what I'm talking about, I'm sure.  At 8 every morning I will play a new song that we have not added to our normal song rotation, and give listeners a chance to call in or post a comment on here as to their opinion, should we pick it or flick it,  meaning should we keep playing it or toss it.  Hope you'll participate.    Second, I have noticed a song that has been a pretty big pop and rock hit, the Los Lonely Boys' "Heaven", is at #18 on the CMT Top 20 Countdown.  And now I have started getting requests for it.  Have you heard the song, and do you think we should play it?  Post a comment on here, or call me at 762-8200.

      I am so proud of myself...for the second day in a row, my show this morning was completely live!  Now, you say to yourself, "Self, what does he mean?  I listen to him and he sounds alive, usually.  Occassionally he sounds a bit comatose, but not dead.  So what does he mean by live?"  Well, here comes the dirty little secret part... we have a computer that allows us to record ourselves and plug it into the music, hopefully making it sound like we are here when we are actually not.  We could be on the other side of the globe, for that matter.  Better than almost every other station in the market, though.  Except for one other station in Clovis and Portales, other than our 2 stations(KKYC-FM and KICA-FM), all the stations here are on satellite from either Dallas or Denver AT LEAST 21 hours a day.  Some are on a satellite fed service 24 hours a day.  So we are the exception, and are truly your local hometown stations.  That being typed, however, let me continue to let the cat out of the proverbial bag.  What you hear on our 2 stations after 9 am is usually recorded.  Example, I usually start recording what you hear me say beginning about 8:30 that morning.  Hopefully, you think it sounds like I am really there.  My shift from 4 to 7 every Monday through Friday on KICA-FM(98.3, rock, should you care to tune in) is 99.9% recorded.  I usually "track it out", as we say in the biz, around 3:30.  But the last 2 mornings, I have felt compelled to do my entire shift from 6 to 10 on KKYC-FM(102.3, country, should you care to tune in) live, without recording a thing.  Almost like the old days of radio, except I didn't have to actually change records or CD's, the computer still played all the music.  But you know what, it was a blast to do the whole thing live.  I think I might start doing it everyday, as long as I don't have something I have to go take care of that necessitates me having to leave the studio or building for an extended period.  God, I miss live radio....

      Well, I certainly hope you guys missed me, otherwise, why the hell did I come back from vacation?  Went to Conchas Lake and did some fishing for a few days, and caught a whopping 2 perch that could have been twins.  Make that triplets, because my oldest son and my nephew caught the third one right on the surface with our net.  My 2 year old caught his first fish(with some help from dad and his cousin), a baby catfish that, even though it was a baby, outweighed both my perch put together.  And I did have a pretty good sized bass that I at least got to the surface before he spit the hook out, and he went one way and the hook and worm went the other way.  Oh well, had fun and family time, and that is really what it was all about.  And not catching any fish meant I didn't have to clean any fish, which is always a good thing.  Anyway, and this is totally unsolicited, if you ever go to Conchas, I highly recommend you stay at Adobe Lodge.  It used to be housing for the Corps of Engineers when they were building the dam, and now someone has bought it and turned the duplexes into lodges.  Very, very nice.  Very close to the North marina and a great view of the lake.  Check them out.  Two thumbs WAY up!

      Once again, your old friend Joe Daniels displays his amazing cognitive abilities...All along I have been saying I don't think Kobe Bryant is guilty of rape.  Stupidity, yes.  Felony stupidity.  But rape?  Don't think so.  Why?  First of all, he's KOBE BRYANT!  He has women lined up around the street to do anything he wants anytime he wants anyhow he wants.  He doesn't have to rape someone.  Secondly, everything about this from day one has smacked of the "victim" filing a civil lawsuit eventually.  Well, guess what, my friends...it came out today that the "victim" is going to talk to the prosecutor in the case about dropping the charges because she is afraid details about her sex life might keep the trial from being fair.  In other words, it might prejudice the jury AGAINST HER .  And wouldn't that screw up her civil lawsuit which, oh by the way, she said she might file now.  Now before I get strung up for being insensitive, let me say that a woman's sexual history doesn't mean she can't be a victim of rape.  A woman can be raped whether she is a nun or a hooker, and it is no less horrible a crime because of her history.  However, for a woman to allege rape when none occurred is equally apalling.  No matter what the outcome of all this, whether the charges are now dropped, whether it goes to trial and Kobe is acquitted, or it goes to trial and he is convicted, Kobe Bryant will never be the same.  Now, could I be wrong about his guilt?  Of course, but I don't think I am... but if I am, I hope his celebrity does not get him off and I hope he does the max.
