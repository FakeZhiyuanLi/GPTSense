      I kinda forgot to write until today! oops! Well anyway the grandrents left and it was a sad yet happy event but the upside is that I got my room back whoho!!! I went and saw The Notebook with Jen (my sister), Mickie, and Meagan I cried like a bazzilion times it was so sad the only person who didn't cry was Jennifer but thats cool. I am thinking of having a party for my birthday (which is in 7 days) but i'm not sure yet cause every time I have tried to have a party something or someone ruines it such as last year (if you didnt hear about the thing like 2 years ago wow your dumb). Anyway i'm really really bored and theres nothing to do. Me and Mickie were reading supossivly scary stories and this is one of them.  "When my parents got divorced, I got really depressed. so after weeks of feeling alone, I decided to commit suicide. I bought bottles of asprin and prepared to leave this world. well, right as I was about to take the pills, I got this horrible itchy rash on my arm. I scratched it and scratched it, and when I finally looked down, I saw that right in the center of the red rash was a patch of white skin in the shape of a cross! I didn't know what to think, but i know I'm still here today because of it-and happy about it!"  (it could have been a sign from god telling her not to kill herself or it could have been the way she was itching the rash but it's just one of lifes many mysteries)

      Today was a fun day the whole family and Mickie (who's practically part of the family anyway) went bowling. I beat Jennifer and Mickie twice, then Jennifer beat us twice it was ultimatly a good game except the computer messed up and said I got 2 strikes which was awsome for me but not fair for them. After a couple games of bowling we left and went out to eat at some chinese restraunt that used to be the Old Country Buffet. Jen and I went to the movies well she went with the hansons (emilys family) to go see The Terminal but I went by myself to go see Dodgeball! Then came home and played cards till like 1:00! I get my bedroom back on Monday!! I'm so happy!!! And my b-day is in 9 days!!!  Well I have nothing else to say so bye!!!

      So today was a totally boring day! I went with Mickie and Jen to go pick up Cory, went to Mcdonalds, came home and played cards with the grandrents, Jen, and Mickie, watched tv, talked to Meagan on the phone, wrote another song so far I have 5. I am going to send them to my uncle to get them revised and have him find a beat for it(he's in that kinda buisness). Kelly and Meagan (my brothers friends) came over and we started talking and then Meagan was talking about my mom skinny dipping in the pool while everyone was gone!! Of course it freaked me out and made me not wanna ever swim in our pool again! The Warped Tour got cancled till Monday and I thought I was ganna get to go afterall but I still cant! it's really boring without my sister or my brother being here at the moment and I dont even have a room to just go chill in and listen to music because my grandrents are staying in my room so I get to sleep downstairs on the couch (oh the joys). I still remember a long time ago my grandma telling me i was going to end up being a stripper! I can't wait till next summer I wont be as bored seeing as this is my last summer without a car! which is very exciting!   My b-day is coming soon!!! July 6th! whoho can't wait! (thinking of having a party but don't know yet)

      My day was an alright day Meagan and I went to the mall again which was fun except at the end we got depressed cause we started thinking about some things that can't be said on here!(sorry).So anyway the Warped tour is tomorrow and I would be going but my friend had a family problem so I can't go now. But it's ok...I guess. I have nothing else to say except I had a really boring day!

      Obviously if your looking at this you wanna know what I did today or your just bored and have nothing else to do! So anyway I woke up called Meagan and decided to go to the mall and we met up with Morgan, Katlyn, Josh, and some other guys who I dont know. After totally freaking Josh out with storys about Meagan we went to Casa Ole and met up with like 7 more people we finished eating and  and Meagan and I decided to leave well we kinda forgot to pay our bill!(well I really did forget Meagan just didnt wanna pay).Then me and Meagan went to the food court just to sit and talk and some random guy walks up and sits with us and started to have a conversation about what we are ganna do after we graduate from high school! wtf was he thinking! He was 17 too! Then he gave Meagan and I his number(like we are ever ganna call it!).After walking around Jen (my sister) came and picked us up and we went to a Young Life picture party but we could only stay like 10 or 20 mins. Then I went to adamson lagoon with Jen and Mickie I really didn't think I would have that much fun but I really actually did!  So that was my first blog I hope you liked it if you didn't well screw you!

      so anyway the past few days were filled with adventure! lol!  meagan jeffery and brittany came to pick me up cause we were ganna go jet skiing but we decided to go the next day because to stupid jet ski was messed upand wouldnt work. so we went to my house cause i thought the pool was clean ended up with really wasnt so we just hung out for a while then as we were leaving i told jeffery to peel out in the driveway cause i didnt think my parents were looking so he did and then me and meagan stood out of the t-top and screamed. it was great fun! but then we get a call from my mother and she was yelling at jeffery and all this crap! after that we went to block buster i felt really bad about my mom yelling at jeff so i let them decided what movie to get so me and meagan sat on the car outside and all the sudden the pizza guy from papa johns walks up and asked us if we wanted a free pizza it was freakin awsome except for the fact that it had peppers in it and it burned forever!!! we went back to meagans house and watched badder santa wow talk about funny movie! then jeff had to leave. meagan and i had the worst sleeping arrangment we had to share a freakin twin sized bed and let me tell yall that i roll around in my sleep and sleep with my eyes open! talk about scarin the crap out of meagan (muslum kristin hahaha)! we had to wake up at freakin 8 o'clock (i was not a happy camper) we went to pick up jeff and headed off to the lake i tried to jet ski because jeff was callin me a pansy so i went and lets just say i really suck at it! then we ate taco bell (i got the bean burrito without the onions haha its just my good luck) and after that we went tubing holy crap it was awsome! i went third with brittany spotting me and all the sudden the tube flipped over and the bottoms to my bathing suit fly off! it was awsome!!! lol! i got so sunburned! then meagan, brittany, and mickie stayed the night with me and jennifer all together it was a fun night (oh the memories)! during the middle of the night meagan got mad and walked down our driveway (if you have been to my house you know how long the driveway is) so i walked down the driveway to try to find her and i hear this crying sound so i thought she was on the tree swing so i ran over there and no one was there i walked inside and on the way there i heared the noise again but when i went inside meagan and everyone else was in there! (kinda weired) we slept in the band room and all the sudden meagan starts like yelling my name so i woke up and she said she saw someone standing at the top of the stairs and then run down and started making a popping noise i heared the popping noise but i didnt see the guy or whatever it was so i held meagans hand (cause im a good friend lol) and she was crying on my sholder hehe! (lets all laugh at meagan for that ..1...2...3 haha!) meagan, brittany, and i went to the other house and slept on the couches and heared the dogs start barking wow kinda strange after seeing that! woke up the next day and was bored all day with meagan and chloe then we watched fireworks while everyone was in the pool it was great fun and i have no idea what im ganna do for the rest of the night but i think ill go try to figure something out right now!  night!   p.s. my b-day is in 3 days! whohohohohohohohoh!
