      there is no particular reason for the title of this post. i just happen to think it's a cool quote. i forget who said it and i don't have the debut album of the manics here so i could use that as an aid. that's where the quote is from. i think it was linked with motorcycle emptiness in the sleevenote...  i'm tired today. i don't get it, i slept almost 8 hours last night, which is almost twice what i've slept lately - how can i be tired now? maybe it's because of yesterday's trip to the lighthouse... it involved a lot of sitting, first in the bus (as we went to other places before going to the lighthouse) and then in the boat. i don't travel well. when we got there it was amazing. i didn't want to come back at all... the guide we had lives there almost alone for 9 months of the year (or that's how i understood it) and he was such a nice man... he looked like someone who really belonged there and was happy. i guess he was. i would love to live like that. if only i could still get online if i wanted to... i wouldn't have a problem cutting out physical encounters with other people. maybe i would come out of there in the winter though, as its pretty rough living there then from what he told us. but other than that, i wouldn't mind looking at the view from the top of that lighthouse every single day. and think of all the exercise i would get climbing up there - it was 178 steps. climb that a few times every day, and walk around the island in addition... i'd say that's pretty good!  i don't have much else to say now it seems. 4 hours of work left, then it's the weekend. yay, i suppose. or not. dad's going to be around so maybe not so much of a yay. meeting anne tomorrow, i hope that's good. i'm sure it will be. need a refill on the laxies department too, that has to be taken care of today. i'm going to visit a new pharmacy now and i hope they sell metalax. toilax is acting weird on me. i can't specify because i don't really know what's weird with it. all i know is that i feel weird. i've been taking only 20 a day now, instead of 25. it seems to have some effect as despite binging i haven't really gained for the past 3 days or so. a bit of food weight here and there but that's what laxies are there for eh? the real problem with toilax is that you the largest packet size is 100. metalax has 200, which means i don't have to buy it as often. it tastes yuckier though. decisions, decisions...  ok. talking about laxies made me feel ill. i think i will finish my lunch hour now by going to the bathroom. i just want to state in the end that i really suck. no, really. blegghhhh.

      who would have guessed? sickness isn't comfortable after all. i have that blegghhhh feeling again - i really really hope that it leaves by this afternoon when i get off work. might have to rethink laxies. but then i always rethink them and then end up getting some anyway. it's not easy to do the good thing for yourself when you don't deserve good things... i haven't SId since the aspirin episode and the following days. i even forgot my best knife to work for the weekend, which was odd. of course i have spare blades around the house but that's hardly the point. there is no point. i wonder why i'm not doing it so much anymore. well, i do have some nice scars up my arms so if and when i am forced to see that doctor he/she will have something to ask about.  does laxative abuse show in lab tests? it's funny how i never think exactly what my behavior might be doing to my body. i mean i've read about people with similar kind of things, but those people are not me. what i do is nothing, normal, everydaily. what they do is something worth worrying about. my life never is. blegghhh. blegghhh blegghhh blegghhh. back to work, slave! >.

      well, i need it. i should be asleep as i type this, there will be trouble at work tomorrow if i go there dozing off every three minutes. today was hard enough. i must be in bed by 1 am. must be. must. ive not been the best blogger so far... but the site is really keeping me busy. i was afraid i would end up binging today but eventually all i've had so far is satsumas. i did have lots though, but they are relatively low in calories. today's total: somewhere around 360. i might have an apple still... it's past midnight so i shouldn't be eating (as if i EVER should be eating! gosh.) but i am feeling rather sick because of the laxies. tomorrow i have to buy more again - and i'm rather nervous about that. i don't know which pharmacy to go to. i hate to always be thinking about stuff like that... blegghh. i'm thinking of whether i should go update my journal at AF too. i have posted there several times today so i guess it won't be necessary... i had a lot of fun over there during the weekend, cross-posting with blank and laura. it's so weird how some people are so nice to you. for absolutely no reason at all. i can never ever get used to that. ok, now i can't really keep my eyes open anymore. must go to bed i suppose. well, not bed - floor - but it means the same thing. and does it really make a difference where you sleep?

      enjoy this moment. at this moment, this blog is spotless. pure. unspoiled. innocent. a virgin. no mindless ramble - just the hollow echo of... the void. except that voids don't have echoes. that's just a sidenote, don't mind such minor details.  i will try and be a good blogger. i hope it will work. now, insert some silent expectation while i retrieve back behind my walls... my high brick walls. screetch. crash. mash. splurt. that's the sound of someone running into them, voluntarily, and getting her brain mashed and splurted in the process. guess who that is ~.Â¤    I'LL BE BACK

      the title? it's the name of the ween song that i'm listening to at the moment. to start the morning happily. it's a good song. this is needless information. i should keep my post title backgrounds a secret more often, to make things... snazzier. i just might do that. (yeah, THAT'll happen.)  i didn't sleep so good. not so good at all. do you hate it when you fast and have serious trouble drinking? i think i'm chronically a little dehydrated. yesterday i drank a total of a little less than 1.5 l. i don't think that's enough. i didn't eat, just like i didn't eat on thursday either (duh! fasting does mean not eating, doesn't it? THINK before you type!) yet i downed 25 laxies and 10 water pills at one go, when i got home from work, i went to sleep quite early, around 10pm... i wasn't tired but i just felt like i needed to go and sleep a bit.   woke up the first time around 12.30am. dad hadn't even fallen asleep then, i saw him reading the paper when i went to the bathroom. after that i had a sip of my one calorie per 100 ml juice. that made me feel very sick. i didn't puke but i could have, easy. if i did such things, that is. i felt so sick. i still do, when i think about it.  rest of the night was pleasant, waking up several times for bathroom and not really sleeping properly inbetween. but now that i weighed myself, i had indeed lost 2 kg since last night. how is it possible? well, it's water weight obviously. lots of it. however, this means that i'm back in the normal weight range (according to some standards - of course most require a bmi below 24 until you're in the normal range, and i'm not quite there yet...) and one nasty kilogram apart from my first tiny part-goal. so i'm not asking too many questions about the quality of the weight lost. how healthy of me, yet again ._o   i'm taking this in 3 kg steps. i need to lose and if it takes babysteps to do it, babysteps it is! dammit. be it pathetic or not. i don't just want to lose, i NEED to. so i can't really risk things anymore. i have to keep losing. and it's not like i have a health to maintain in the process so basically it's whatever it takes.  i will be doing some research online about a so called miracle diet pill i read about in the night when i couldn't sleep. there was a woman who claimed to have lost 19 kg in 6 weeks while on it. without changing her eating habits AND without exercise. it sounds bogus, yes. the effect is based on negative calories (and we all know that negative calories can't be real right? ...right? er.). the pills are made of 3 different types of seaweed, one of them was spirulina (i don't remember the others because spirulina was the only one i've read about before) and some selected herbs. i must research this. i sure would like to lose 19 kg in 6 weeks. i was thinking, maybe do this 2 day fast/one day of eating regime WITH the pills. i wonder what that would do. though i think those pills work best with food, as you're supposed to take them before a meal so the negative calories in them will seriously make you burn fat while you're digesting what you have eaten. i'm not sure, i was a bit dozed off while i was reading this. i must look into it. i might even order the damn pills. it's not like i care about the money loss. ohh i will find things out...  this is the longest post. i'm out of breath, figuratively. i will diminish (hopefully), go to the west and remain ...myself for the rest of the day. also hopefully.  +_+

      2 days and roughly 17 hours without food, right about now. is control not the sweetest thing in the world... if it isn't i want to know what is. because to be honest, i really can't imagine a feeling that is sweeter. not now, not ever. i don't remember when was the last time that i felt this good. oh yes, that's right - the last time i fasted.   i know that most people would be able to go without food for almost 3 days if they absolutely had to. but how many people do it when they don't have to? it's a good question. another good question would of course be WHO does that... but i will let that one pass by unnoticed. i'm on a power trip now, at least for a while, and i'm making the most of it. don't try to stop me, because you would succeed. blegghhh.  all in all, a good day until 4.20pm ^_^

      ahhhh.  no, this doesn't mean i've eaten. i haven't eaten, and it's been close to two days. but i haven't lost weight properly! so i got desperate and took some water pills too. not smart. very not smart. extremely not smart. i should know better. and i have the yuckiest sweet taste in my mouth. i hate this taste, i had forgotten how bad it is... and i think the laxies make it worse. they definitely don't make it better.   ok, i have to concentrate. did anything of interest happen today, today of all days?  i don't think so. i think that today was lame, boring, stupid, annoying, tiresome, useless, ugly, sickening, despisable, horrible, horrid, disgusting, did i forget a negative adjective there? if i did, be kind and insert it, mentally, here.  but i still haven't eaten. i don't have any food around the house. the shops are still open for 1.5 hours. i'd have time. plenty of time to go and get some binge food. i'm craving a sandwich, i'm craving french fries. i'm craving All Things Salty. ahhh i want to get rid of.... oooh now i remembered a few more adjectives, i must go back and add...  *silence as she does so*  i added them. rack your brains about which ones i added, you non-existent audience!  i feel sick. i will go away and feel sick somewhere else so i won't stain these wonderfully red/pink pages... the color is there for a reason. it's a neurotic reason. i won't share it with you. ha. take that. (i just lOve saying that!)  `_Â´

      yay! it really is, for at least a little bit again... here goes: i've managed to not eat today! and in the morning i threw away all the food that i might have considered eating. and when i went shopping for food, i only got some juice which was 1 calorie per 100 ml. add to that, i also bought laxies and i've taken 25 - i feel like i'm positively flying! it's 8.15 pm and i've been drinking juice. ok, so in form of juice i will have around 20 calories today, altogether. yay for me!   gosh, i'm so happy about this... even if it's just for one day, i have really gained back some control now. i've not been able to fast a day for weeks and i am very proud of myself at the moment. i just hope i won't crash...   wish someone was online so i could share it with them...  *floats away in the happy spot in her brain*  ^_^

      thats what i am, right? this is my second blog entry today. i have to do this, because i can't update my journal on AF now. i am the last person who posted there and i'm particular about such things. i can't post until at least one person (preferrably two) has posted in it after my latest entry. i don't want to look as desperate as i am. in a horrid way, everything seems to be a competition to me. i feel bad about it. i can never win, yet i have to keep competing. and therefore i keep losing. losing makes me sad. losing makes me a failure. do i set myself up for a failure, by putting up these competitions i know i will lose? i think it would be ridiculous to claim that i don't do that. so i'm not going to.   nothing works in my life right now. i'm thinking about seeing a doctor, yet again. how many times have i thought about it within the last 2 months? every sunday? more than that? it must be more than that. i don't know how i'm going to make myself go to work tomorrow. i know i'm going to, but i just don't know how. it's going to surprise me. i will be very surprised when i find myself sitting at my desk.   gosh, why is everything so screwed up?  i think i will have to go. this won't do. i want to cut, but i don't think it will help things. tomorrow i'm going to make some decisions. hold your breath. or don't. i wouldn't trust my words.

      i have been sleeping away a big part of this weekend. sometimes you have to. there's just no other way to escape your life. this morning i really didn't want to get up. i lay on the floor and played with the thought of staying there all day... there's nothing in the world for me to get up for. then i got up, because that's how things go. i'm not disciplined.  here i sit now, online as always. i was supposed to go get laxatives today but i'm not going to. i can't. leaving the house is too much an effort. i feel like shit. shitshitshit. and it never ends does it, i've felt like this for so long... i don't even remember how long.  when i wasn't eating i felt so much better. i have to get rid of this stress that makes me binge all the time, i can't deal with it... and now this stuff with my father - it's becoming too much. and there's no one to help me with it. i know we're all alone in it all, but sometimes - i don't know, sometimes i just wish we weren't. maybe that's silly, i know it is. but that's the way i feel, silly or not.  i feel like jumping off the balcony. i want to be dead by tomorrow... tomorrow is scary. my life is scary. i don't want to get up, i don't want to be up. help. blegghhhh.

      ha. ha. the only news is that i have lost one pound from last night. and that is without laxies. yes, i really didn't take them. i'm pretty amazed myself, i was certain that this would result in weight gain... but it hasn't. well, not yet anyway. knock on wood or whatever.  today is payday so i'm going to shop a bit after work. must get the new ministry album. i was thinking of getting velvet revolver too, but i'm not sure yet. i guess it depends on my mood.  random things. today i must resist the friday treat during coffee break here at work. there's always a treat on fridays, and it's traditionally hard to stay away from it. but i can do it. by that time (1.30pm to be exact) i will have gone without food for 4 and a half days and i only have about 12 hours to make my goal of 5 days. i am really not going to give in to a stupid treat! no way. just watch...  i suppose i will start thinking about work now. and maybe even doing some, eventually. was at AF but not much is happening there now. or is it just that there's so many new people and i don't know them at all... so i feel a bit lost. maybe it's that. i will go back later i guess. but now, slavery awaits. mind the whips.  ~_~

      well, yesterday was eventful. no more of that ^_^  thursday. thursday, thursday, thursday. i wonder how come thursdays were always such bad days for me. maybe it's the fact that it isn't friday yet but it ALMOST is. i don't know. i will be really happy to go home today. work is a bitch when i have too much responsibility... i am actually timing my lunch break now. the alarm in my phone goes off when the lunch is over. at that time i must stop writing. i have tons of work to do. tons. you have no idea... well, maybe that's going a bit too far. but there's loads.  it's day 4 now, and i'm not particularly hungry anymore. i had indeed lost two pounds from yesterday afternoon, thanks to ever-powerful laxies. i'm thinking of not taking them now that i'm not eating. i haven't taken any today and if my weight hasn't gone back up when i get home, i think i will pass altogether. but if it's up (i don't trust my body anymore, at all) i will have to take action. i really, really hope it won't be up because i want to be able to sleep well for once. i hate always going to bed feeling ill -_-  so, losing those pounds makes my BMI smaller. it's still too huge. massively huge. 23.9 i think o_O that's sick. plain sick! i make myself sick. i can't post my weight on AF anymore... i guess i'm secretly hoping that everyone has forgotten how fat i really am... but then again i really don't want them to forget. i want them to painfully remember it. just like i do.   since i joined AF i have lost... let's see... 13 pounds. but i have also gained during the time. and lost again. and gained again. but at the moment i am 13 pounds below my starting weight. and it has to go down now. my first goal is 5 pounds away. i was going to lose it by saturday morning but because of my freak of a body it will not happen. i'd have to lose over two pounds a day and that's not possible. not when there's no water weight to be lost...  i wish i was home already. i want to weigh myself. -_+

      ok. i have fasted for 2 days now and i haven't even lost half a pound!  i'm really getting aggravated #_# after all the purpose of this fast IS to lose weight and not just sit around and maintain. god, i could slit my wrists right about now, i'm so pissed! i have to lose by this afternoon. have to. if i'm still stuck with that same stupid number i will do something i'll regret. i just know it. but hey, if that will make me lose, i don't really care. and i don't think i will be regretting it very much either...  today sucks. everything sucks. my good mood has gone byebye. today's list of facts:  1. i am fat. 2. i am ugly. 3. i am stupid. 4. i am lazy. 5. everyone hates me and thinks i'm boring. 6. everyone is right. 7. i am a failure at anything i start with. 8. i feel sick. 9. this will not be over by tomorrow.  actually, that fact list pretty much stands for every damn day. self pity fest, yeah! i hate my life and i wish i was dead. why can't i just be dead? why can't the damn nuclear missile hit me for once and then it would all be done with! i want to cross out some facts and me ending up dead is the only way i can accomplish this. because, another fact list exists. it's a mirrored one, check it out:  1. i will never be thin. 2. i will never be beautiful. 3. i will never be smart. 4. i will never work hard enough. 5. no one will ever like me or think that i'm interesting. 6. well, ok, i can't think of one to match this one but you get the idea... 7. i will never accomplish anything at all. 8. i will never stop feeling sick. 9. this will go on forever.  BLEGGHHHH. BLEGGHHHH. BLEGGHHHH. where is my knife when i need it '_'

      yes. that was cheap. do not feel oblidged to laugh.  yesterday was a binge day. it was going well until 8pm but then again, everyone knows that 8pm is evil. well, at least after last night. everyone SHOULD know.  it's ok though, because the pills i took have got me back to almost the weight i was at yesterday morning. i'm not worried. i've also not eaten today, which is what was planned. i'm feeling really sick now, and tomorrow i will be feeling even sicker. holding out for wednesday. that will save me. third day - how i love the third day. and how i loathe the second day. blegghhh. work was hell today, mostly because i really wasn't able to concentrate.   i am getting more and more dehydrated and i don't know what to do about that. i have to think of something i can drink... i can't seem to down more water than is needed to get the pills down. and the obligatory 500ml bottle of the one calorie juice at work. today i've had that... and i guess about 800ml of water, 700 of which was to get down the pills. i will be in trouble if i don't start drinking. the pills make me lose a lot of water and i'm not taking in enough even for someone who ISN'T constantly OD'ing on laxies and water pills. blegghhh again. i hate my body - not just for how it looks but also for having demands!   wish there was no work for tomorrow. i hate work. i'm tired. i think i should go lie down and hope i will get some sleep... i don't believe in hope though. but that's beside the point. i will rest. yes. rest i will. *sigh*  Z_z

      don't you just love the velvet underground. i do ^_^ still listening to ween though. i'm too lazy to change the cd i suppose. it has happened in the past...  yesterday was... well, i didn't eat. it's getting easier to not stuff my face constantly. seems like i'm finally getting out of my binge cycle, at least for now. let's hope it lasts. it has to.  today i'm going to see the beloved mother. oh, the beloved mother... umm. i don't feel like it. i'm still intrigued though - she invited me over with no obvious reason. normally there always is a reason of some sort. i hope it's nothing bad.  the meal i will be served is veggie soup, so it's not too bad. not too bad, that is, if it was all i was having. it won't be. this is the reason i didn't eat yesterday, even though my plan would have included that. change of plans i suppose. two days of fasting and one day eating taking turns was the plan when i thought i wouldn't be able to carry out a fast longer than two days. i was wrong. so, now i'm puzzled. i'm thinking of maybe extending the next fast to at least 3 days. maybe 4 or 5, even. i will have to see. i'm getting addicted to the scale number going down. ha. what a joke. i've been addicted to it for a long while now - it just hasn't been happening that much...  ok, i will go and find out about the calories in that veggie soup now so i can be prepared. i also have plans for making a veggie baquette when i get home from the mother. it is what i've been craving really, so i'm going to treat myself with it. if i won't be eating for a few days i figure it's ok to have something i like. well, of course it's not really ok but i'm in denial.   i HATE force feeding!   `-Â´

      well, i solved the problem of the plateau. i knew that i could always go up in weight, so i binged. am i smart or what? *sigh* and i wasn't supposed to take any laxies but the pounds i'd gained when i weighed myself in the morning convinced me otherwise. so now i'm at work, i've just downed 25 of those precious things and... yeah. it's not the best situation to be in. i just hope they work, i don't give a shit about anything else.   i watched "rosemary's baby" last night... it was good. mia farrow is so beautiful... so thin. i could see her ribs stick out a little, and her hip bones. but she has such pretty eyes too. and when she was losing weight at one point in the film, she looked so... frail. it was lovely. well i did like the set design of the film too, i wasn't just staring at her ribs the whole time (they weren't shown the whole time, obviously). i forget who was the male star but he wasn't good looking really. well i guess he was in a way... but just not my way. he did have a neat jacket at one point though, a white one.  ok, ramble-ramble. i will stop here. blegghhh. 7.5 hours to freedom.  @_O

      ok, i give up. i just wasn't meant to eat at all. i think i have only ever digested any food by accident - i don't really have a metabolism and i don't use up any energy at all. everything i take in makes me gain weight and it's never coming off. i will be this weight until i die. unless i eat something and then of course i will be even fatter.   i wonder if i can go without food forever and ever?  *bangs head against the wall until is bleeding all over the place*  -_-

      i am fasting. i am not losing any weight. during weekend i ate. i didn't gain any weight. what the FUCK is going on?????  i want to binge but i've promised myself i won't do that. i have promised to keep going until at least friday... only friday because it is a long weekend and dad will be around on friday. there's nowhere to go. he might go somewhere of course, and i could lie about having eaten while he was away. i don't know.  i was going to weigh 67 kg tomorrow. but it seems that it is impossible for me to weigh that. i wonder if i will EVER weigh less than 68 kg again. i seriously doubt that. i hate myself. i wish i knew what else i could do besides completely stop eating - even that doesn't make me lose. i'm going to cry soon -_-  can this be all about ketosis? day three is tomorrow. by body should hit ketosis tomorrow. then it should dig into my endless fat reserves. i really hope it does, because i can't deal with much more of this. i swear i look fatter. i FEEL fatter. it's not right. nothing is right anymore. i hate everything. every damn thing!  BLEGGHHHHHH! *cries uncontrollably and hysterically, until passes out*  O_.

      do you ever get the urges to rip your skin right off, screaming, then toss it in the ground and jump on it until there's nothing left, and then set your skin-ridden body on fire and chop off your limbs with an axe and then place a shotgun in your mouth and pull the trigger?  i get those urges. right now would be one occasion.   i left my phone to work. i'm all alone, i have nothing and no one and i'm always going to fail in everything i do and i'm ugly and fat and i have no future and everyone hates me and wants me to shut up and go away.  i think i will SI tonight. i'm surprised if i don't.  GOD PLEASE DON'T HAVE ME EAT ANYTHING. I WILL BE FINE IF I DON'T EAT. THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS!

      i want to die. i'm feeling so sick and so bloated and i'm so fat that i could easily just kill myself because i'm so fat. i don't deserve to live. i'm so disgusted that i can't really find words for it. so i think i will just give up. i won't post here until i've lost some weight and am allowed to again. hopefully that will be soon. but because i'm a greedy fat pig, it's not very likely. #_#

      that's what i need to do now. i need to focus.  it has been a horrible, terrible, despisable long weekend of binge after binge after binge after binge. i haven't dared weigh myself since friday. i made a pact with someone that i wouldn't do it until in about 4 weeks but i'm not sure... well, at least i won't do it until the end of this week. i will try to fast until friday, it will be hard but i must do it. i have to get back to my friday weight, even thought that was a high one. still, i must start somewhere. i've not even looked at my thinspiration notebook, because that's where i had written down all my goals and right now they are just too damn depressing to look at. i only have about 20 days to lose something which i assume is around 15 kilograms. that's not even remotely possible. i was thinking of rationalising it a bit and try to reach my so-called NORMAL *shudders* weight by the 16th. it would be my lowest weight ever, and i think even that is about 10 kilograms away. i'm not sure as i don't know my weight. last friday it would have been 7 kilograms away but then again, i've gained since that. maybe even more than i think. oh god, i'm so scared o_o  i can't bring myself to posting in my journal on AF. i'd have to confess to all this and all those pretty skinny people there would laugh at my patheticness so much... not because they are mean but because any sensible person would find it impossible to not laugh. what am i doing posting there in the first place? we come to it again, the question. the never-ending question: where do i belong and where not? i think i don't belong anywhere. i must lose more weight. maybe then i will belong. maybe i should join MF. maybe everyone isn't wonderfully skinny over there... still, i'm sure they're all skinnier than me. why does everything feel like a damn competition?  blegghhh. that IS a legitimate word, no matter what anyone says. my throat hurts... i don't know why. could i be coming down with a nasty thing? could the world be that merciful? i think not. i think it's just... something else. i also feel puffy. i don't like to be drinking. still, i must drink if i want my metabolism to work, and i want it to work. so bad. i decided not to go and buy laxies today, even though i was going to. i'm really scared of being addicted to them now, but i think it's too late. i already am. ah well, what's another thing like that, in relation to what already is wrong with me? except nothing really IS wrong with me or is it?   i want some answers that i can actually believe in. there was a fire on thursday, right next to where i work. it looked horrible, a whole warehouse burned down, nothing but dust left. it was arson. i'm oddly intrigued...  i must draw, one of these nights. i have one order lined up, i'm getting 100 euros for it. it's a nice round sum. i hate drawing. i love money. well, i don't love money anymore, but i must pretend to because i don't want to forget what love is. i need some fake objects for it.

      not worthy, just bored. i have most likely gained since the latest entry and i continue to do so. i just eat and eat and it never stops. i blame work - i know it isn't entirely because of work, but this level of stress surely doesn't help things o_q   it's a big question. i truely loathe myself these days. there's no sign of control of any kind, all i can see is weakness. even the cramps from laxies won't put me off food. i know i'm getting cramps (because i surely can't eat if i don't take them, because then i would definitely gain even more and be even more bloated... i know they only make me lose food weight and water, i know that... i'm just not giving a damn) but even knowing that i will still eat. tons. and more tons. i will be a whale soon. i haven't dared to weigh myself for about 2 weeks soon i think. to me thats a horribly long time. i'm so scared because i know i will weigh over 80 kilograms. i know it. it might even be a lot more than 80. i know that AND STILL I STUFF MY FACE? yes, i am clearly insane.   please just kill me O_O i can't take this much longer.

      ah the excitement. tomorrow i will find out how my first week on the plan has turned out... from last sundays weight up until this morning (saturday) i have lost 7.2 kilograms (16 pounds, 1.2 stone). that's a bit less than the friday-to-friday weight. still, pretty good for 6 days ^_^   i know it wont continue as peachy as this. i know it will slow down... and most likely, it will remarkably slow down. that's ok. i will not let that get me down... as long as i lose the planned 1.25 kilograms (2.75 pounds) a week, i will be happy with myself. i hope.   calorie tracking started on monday, and so far it looks like this:   MONDAY - nothing.  TUESDAY - nothing.  WEDNESDAY - 170.20  consisting of leek, cauliflower, champignons, cucumber, garlic and red grapefruit  THURSDAY - 136.16  consisting of leek, cauliflower, garlic,&nbsp;cucumber, tomato, zucchini, eggwhite and mandarin  FRIDAY - 59.87  consisting of champignons, cucumber and tomato  SATURDAY - 134.74  consistin of champignons, cucumber, tomato, cauliflower, celery root, garlic, spinach, onion, 0.2% cream cheese, red grapefruit and frozen green grapes   it looks pretty decent. tomorrow i'm aiming below 200, and it really isn't a problem. the part that i have planned, which is the main part of the main course, will make 73.16 calories. to that i will add dessert, which is still open for discussion. i just might indulge in some water melon... if i choose that, the serving size would be about 400 grams (weighed with peel) and that would make it 67.60 cals. so, 140.76 altogether. i might add some pickles though, as i've not had them for a while and they are yummy ^_^ 50 grams should do... that's 6.50 calories extra, which means that the final total would be 147.26. i will see what i do. i could also buy mandarin again... that would be two of them, probably about 240 grams... and 79.00 calories. or if they are very small, maybe they would weigh 200 grams. that would leave me with 66 calories. not a huge difference in the total...  then again, i have grapes in the freezer ^_^ 100 grams in a bag and that would only be 41.30 calories. the total then being 120.96. i like the sound of that, very much... i think i have a plan for tomorrow ^_^   did i confuse someone? i really like playing with numbers now. and i like my rules... the rules i like the most&nbsp;are numbers 4, 7, 8 and 9:   4. whenever you want to eat, drink a big glass of water first. this also concerns planned meals.  7. set a table and prepare your own food whenever possible. weigh your food whenever possible.  8. never eat voluntarily after 7pm.  9. never eat in front of the TV or by the computer.   who would've known what a bit of structure can do for you?  anyway, i was going on about numbers. now that i have tomorrows calories figured out, i will do the math. i have consumed 621.93 calories this week, ending tomorrow at midnight. this means 88.85 calories per day, which to me is pretty damn good ^_^   next week is going to be different though. i have a new calorie thing set up. it begins on monday and this is how it is:   MONDAY -&nbsp;200 calories  TUESDAY - 100 calories  WEDNESDAY - 0 calories  THURSDAY - 200 calories  FRIDAY - 100 calories  SATURDAY - 0 calories  SUNDAY - 200 calories   it's my own twisted and reversed version of 2-4-6-8. this way, my average daily calorie intake will be *gulp* 114.29 calories. i was going to try 300-150-0, but i realised that would leave me with too high daily average. it would have been over 171 for this week O_O&nbsp;at the moment i can't deal with that. i have thought about it though, and after the monday and tuesday of the following week i will probably have a day of 400, just to mess my body up a bit. so it will suddenly go like this:   MONDAY - 100 calories  TUESDAY - 0 calories  WEDNESDAY - 400 calories  THURSDAY - 200 calories  FRIDAY - 100 calories  SATURDAY - 0 calories  SUNDAY - 200 calories   that will make a high daily average of 142.86, but i'm hoping it will keep the nonexistent metabolism going. this is the plan anyway. it's still in the making. i might think differently tomorrow, after consulting someone about this...  yesterday i was trying to find out what my BMR would be at my goal weight&nbsp;- because weight loss manuals tend to say that when you start a healthy diet, you should constantly eat according to your goal weight's needs. it makes all the sense in the world when you think about it. that way you won't be in trouble when trying to maintain in the end... anyway, the results varied quite a bit depending on the calculator. the one i used just now, found at  urlLink http://health.discovery.com/tools/calculators/basal/basal.html &nbsp;tells me that at my goal, i'd burn 1,305.8 calories a day just staying in bed. the site i used to rely on (and the one i still use quite a bit) which is  urlLink www.caloriesperhour.com  suggested 1,312.00 - so 1.300 is what i consider quite right. according to them that is. personally i know that i don't burn calories at all. well, obviously i burn some, but not nearly as much as that...  anyway, this is a handy thing to use when counting how big my calorie deficit should be to get to a certain weight in a certain time. if i take in 150 a day, that would mean a 1.150 deficit per day. at that rate i would lose&nbsp;a pound in 2.5 days, just about. make it 3, as i have no metabolism. so in the end it will most certainly be impossible to lose 1.25 kilograms (2.75 lbs) per day. i know this. but i have a long way to go until i reach that point...   look at the length of this post *shakes head*  i'm going to go now, and tomorrow i will return with my week one result. here and on AF. this was a ramble, sure - but most likely i only have one occasional reader, so it's all good i suppose ^_^ Lady Muffin, if you're reading this: i love you!  until tomorrow...   o_O

      at work again. nothing is happening. including work ^_^ i just have bitchy and difficult jobs to deal with so i won't start on them. this will get me into trouble.  Lady Muffin was a darling and commented on my somewhat peculiar weight loss... well, i will tell you exactly what happened during those 4 marvellous days.    FRIDAY   food: binge. won't list calories but it was WAY beyond 2000. 3000, even. laxies: 55. i think. (30+25)    SATURDAY   food: nothing. laxies: 50. (25+25)    SUNDAY   food: binge again. the calories about the same as on friday. laxies: 50. (25+25)    MONDAY   food: nothing again. laxies: 25. (at one go)   that's how i did it. i don't recommend this. and mind you, i had two weeks of serious binges (about the same quality as these two) behind me.   i haven't lost anything since tuesday morning. but i haven't eaten either, so something is going right. this is the third day on my new plan... the plan that lasts until the end of january. oh right, i've probably mentioned it before ^_^ oops,&nbsp;brain not working.   oh, and at my present weight... i am 5.6 kilograms ahead of next sunday's goal *would do a victory dance if wasn't so dizzy and ill*   i will go and play some JT's Blocks now...

       so, i am at work. so, i can't be bothered to work. this is nothing new.    my stomach is growling at me. it's empty, because it had nothing put in it yesterday and hasn't had anything put in it today either. it's still early but from the looks of things this is the current trend.     &nbsp;   i have lost 1.4 stone in 4 days. that's 8.3 kilograms and 18.3 pounds. that's also madness. how can a person lose 1.4 stone in 4 days? especially when she has binged (real binges, not fake binges) on 2 of those? well, i will make some wild guesses. first, water weight. second, food weight. third, long and destruction-enriched binge episode of almost 2 weeks ending. four, two fast days. maybe that accounts for some real weight loss... maybe a pound. i dont care.     &nbsp;   in my body, all laws of body functions are defied. and i'm still overweight, even by clinical standards. but not for long - not by clinical standards. of course according to the real standards i have to lose about 24.4 kilograms still. if i was to follow the phony clinical ones, that number would be 10.9. that's a bit less. that's also self-desception. i'm not going to fall for that.     &nbsp;   long way to go. to anywhere, really.     &nbsp;   O_O

      i was supposed to post my progress here. well, it seems i haven't. how weird.   well, during first week i lost 8.3 kilograms altogether (which is 18.3 pounds and 14.4 stone). its the second week now and i've only lost one petty pound. maintenance sucks.  but, i am sticking to the plan. on monday i had my 200 calorie day (yes, i decided on 200-100-0) and ended up quite close to that, i had 190 calories then. yesterday, on my 100 calorie day i had 98 calories. today it's time for the big zero... i haven't fasted since last tuesday so it makes a nice change.  i'm still thinking about whether i should take my laxies on the fast days or not. i guess i will see how i feel about it when i get home... which is in about... 4 hours. i will have to do some shopping after work (non-groceries of course).  tomorrow i will be making up a new recipe for stuffed zucchinis. i've not decided what goes into it yet, but i have a few pretty certain things in mind ^_^ i think that champignons are definitely one of them. i think i will proceed to counting the calories on that now, so i will have more time to actually work tomorrow. or play JT's Blocks. who knows.  i hope i won't maintain again tonight O_O

       what a day. i've spent around 300 euros on clothes again. nice clothes. expensive clothes. and i'm back to drinking energy drinks... i had honestly forgotten how yummy sugarfree redbull is.       i want to lose weight fast. i want to get to 10.5 by friday... i must get there! i wonder how that will happen... on friday i will take the train to the north and will go visit a friend. it will be nice. i hope i won't be in trouble with food though... i really can't eat with other people. it doesn't work. so, in a way it's really good that i'm going, even in the food sense. it will keep me from binging ^_^ oh how i love holiday! i've virtually been high all day just because i won't have to go to work on monday. it might be silly, but i don't care. it's such a relief ^_^      good news about the orange juice - it isn't 50 calories per 100 ml like i remembered. turns out it's only 40! so that means 300 ml will be 120 calories. and two cans of sugarfree redbull is 16 calories. so, 136 calories a day ^_^ and it's all liquids. i couldn't be happier at my present weight. today is such a good day.       let's see what i weigh now... argh, the depressing scale O_O 10 stone 12 lbs still. that means i have 7 lbs to lose in just six days. well, i'm hoping. i have laxies to make sure i lose, even if it's just water. but i will try to not take them. i will just drink lots. i hear that helps. but what if it doesn't? O_O i shouldn't have weighed myself.       if i get down to 10.5, 145 lbs that is... if i get down to that, i will be 2 lbs from my lowest weight. so i have 9 lbs to go to my lowest weight. the thought of that makes me want to pour more and more laxies down my throat. if i don't lose anything by monday morning, i will do it too. i don't care if it hurts. i don't care at all. as long as the number goes down, i'm all good.       oh right, i purged yesterday. kinda. it was the first time for me, i've never succeeded in it before. it felt horrible right after, but now that i think back to it, i'm glad. because this gives me one more desperate measure to use. and i hear that it gets easier with practice. i will definitely use it the next time i binge... i will try hard enough. and i will drink lots of water and eat the right foods so it will be easier. ice cream seemed good for it at least...      i don't have much to say at the moment. i've been listening to the distillers all day... most days actually. this album lasts only about 28 minutes and it's been playing on repeat. it's so great that i really have no words. too great almost.      i looked at myself via webcam just now, and i almost have cheekbones! O_O that is amazing. my face is getting more defined... i just wish the fat cheeks and the double chin would go away... *sigh*      oh well, i will update again tomorrow, most likely ^_^ now i will take some pictures and then i will organise my CDs. all 600+ of them are still in piles on my bedroom floor. must do something about it ^_^

      funny, isn't it? just yesterday i cursed metalax to hell and today it's suddenly my best friend again.  i took 25+20+35 yesterday. this resulted in my whole digestive system being in a constant state of cramp for 6 hours all the way until 3am this morning, and it all starting again around 9am. it's 10.39am now and things have settled down a little. i'm so grateful to be rid of the bloaty feeling that i don't even care if i've lost weight or not. i feel drained. i feel chilly. these are signs of rapid weight loss. water weight or not. today is a lot better than yesterday.  and i have therapy today. gosh. i'm really not in that mood. ouch, cramps again. i guess i have gone a bit too far with the laxies. (guess? hmm ok...) 80 a day is not good. anyway, i'm sure i will get things sorted now that my holiday is almost here... let's see, i have exactly 12.25 working hours left before that. how cool is that ^_^ then i'm free for 4 weeks. it's a damn scary thought - i'm scared that i will lose my mind without the organised rhythm of working weeks and free weekends. but i guess i will just have to wait and see about that.  i'm going to start drinking energy drinks again i think. three cans of battery a day used to be my diet at one point... that's 500 calories a day. and it's all liquids, so there won't be a problem with digestion. i have really been craving battery, i've not had it for ages. i have a problem with drinking my calories, but maybe that would be the answer for my problems. or not. i will see what it does for me.  now i will pretend to work. i hope the day passes soon, can't wait to get home and just chill...  =_=

      anyone reading this who has access to or is familiar with metalax - DON'T EVER TOUCH IT. ever. it seriously fucks you up. thanks to metalax i can't eat anything anymore. if i eat something, i'm just going to have to get used to having it in me for the rest of my life. my weight will only go up from now on, not down. unless i throw up of course (in which case i will gain a bit less or maintain). but i don't do that. i had a binge yesterday and i've taken 30+20+25 laxies (the 25 i took this morning). nothing happens. you don't want to end up like this. why? because this really isn't funny anymore. it isn't funny to keep bloating like a balloon and never get rid of it. no matter how many pills you take.  this is preaching. i know it is. but i have to do it. i wish i would have known better when i started. well, i did know. but i wish i had cared. i wish i would have just taken the damn aspirin again if i really needed to take pills. at least i would still have a metabolism. not sure about other bodily functions though, but you can't have it all. at least i would, given some self control, be able to lose. now that chance is forever gone from me.  i want to kill myself. i really want to. don't waste your time telling me not to. don't waste time telling me to cheer up. i have been in this for years and years and years and some more years - if it was possible for me to just cheer up i think i would've done it already. even if i'm just faking it all, i'm sure i would've got bored by now.  i hate it when people tell me to think positive. i hate it because right now i just can't do that. i don't have the energy, i barely have enough to function in a satisfactory manner. i have trouble getting out of bed in the morning. i say positive-thinking-force-feeders can fuck off. i'm in a really shitty mood once again. i better go before someone gets hurt.  therapy tomorrow. yay *fakes excitement* O_O

      well, second week on the plan and only 1.1 pounds lost. it has been a week of happenings. a miserable week. i hate this week. i'm going to hate the next week even more. in fact, i hate everything and everyone.  my nerves are so tense that it takes nothing to break them right now. absolutely nothing. just breathe in my direction and i will snap. do i need a holiday? hell yes. but i have five more days to go, not including this rotten, stinking, fucking piece of shit day that today is.  i cut a little last night. it made no sense. i hadn't eaten. i was still very very fat and i continue to be very very fat. oh well. some things never change. i hate it when people tell me i'm not fat, because they are lying. they are lying because they see me not eating, they see me acting funny around food. they don't want to risk it. but no matter what i do around food, it doesn't change the fact that i'm still fat. it will never change that. so what if i'm actually getting close to my so-called ideal weight (determined by doctors who just want everyone to be sickeningly wholesome-looking). i'm not even there yet. and even when i get there i still have a long way to go before i'm even... i have a long way to go.  my fat rolls make me sick O_O does anyone else ever feel like chopping off their stomach because it's just this giant fat-filled bag hanging there? or cutting slices of their thighs because there is a lot to slice off of? i feel that. very strongly. i wonder how much weight i'd lose doing that.  i will never be thin. never.  i'm still going to keep doing this.  i threw up on thursday evening. i had had 194 calories that day, and 10 water pills and 25 laxies. the water pills were clearly a bad idea. four hours after eating i was lying on the sofa on my back, afraid to get up even though i really should have. i was just soo damn dizzy. i was afraid i would either throw up or pass out if i got up. then i finally ventured to drag myself on the floor and sat there for a while, trying to establish myself. it wasn't long until i had to rush to the bathroom and there i was, throwing up undigested food 4.5 hours after taking it in. plus some nice stomach acids. left my throat sore and my eyes bloodshot. at one point my heart was really cramping and i couldn't breathe properly because of the gag reflex. i was rather scared that night.  needless to say i binged the night after. partly for metabolical reasons. and i wanted to make sure that it was just the pills, and not my body rejecting food. i'm stupid and paranoid. you don't have to tell me that, i already know.  now i am back to my pre-binge weight, which was the sucky maintenance weight. so this week's weight loss: 1.1 pounds. 0.5 kilograms. i suck. i really hope that next week will be better.  today i was going to have fruit, worth of 400 calories. it's a new test, i'm doing it with a friend of mine... 400 calories per day, five days a week. two days of fasting. all the calories coming from any kind of fruit. i was going to start today already. but yesterday i fasted, and it wasn't even hard. at all. so i'm tempted to go on with it today too. i will see what happens.  the plan is still very much on. it was never off, even when i binged i knew i'd get back on it the next day. and it wasn't just thinking *oh well, i will start over tomorrow*... i KNEW i would. because i never stopped.  and i never will. this is all i have now. no one can take it away from me.

       ok, so the 2 lbs stayed off. but that is all. that is fucking all! i haven't lost any more, so i suppose it was just an accident that i lost those 2. someone else was supposed to lose them but i did instead. bleh. this is me, the fat cow.       i feel like cutting and it's not even 8am yet O_O      and it doesn't help that i have just drank 300ml of orange juice and 500ml of water. i feel bloated and disgusting. i want to die. i want to disappear.       WHY CAN'T I JUST LOSE WEIGHT?   because i don't deserve to. i deserve to pay for the years of gluttony. i deserve to be fat because that's what i've aimed at with my eating, all my life apart from the last year or maybe 15 months. i must stop complaining when i've obviously brought this on myself.      i will go now *cries* will post here really early tomorrow morning, before i leave for my trip. then we will find out i've maintained again. or better yet, GAINED. now that would be a nice start for the day.      @_@

       i stepped on the scale this morning (i have stepped on the scale at least 15 times after that but that's hardly the point) and i had indeed lost 2 lbs from yesterday morning's weight. does this mean my body doesn't work like a sponge anymore? i guess i will see about that tomorrow when the weight has come back on O_O i'm sorry, i just don't trust my body anymore. and i have been drinking a lot of water today... too much maybe. 3 liters i think. i'm sure i will have gained.      and again, new info about my orange juice. i have assumed all this time that 100 ml of the stuff weighs 100 grams (which would be logical, right? i know that this is not the case with all liquids but i would've thought that juice equals water, more or less, in the weight sense). well, today i weighed 100 ml of my orange juice, just for kicks. guess what? it only weigs about 90 grams O_O this means that in my 300 ml glass of orange juice, there are only 108 calories and not 120 like i was thinking! this brings my daily calorie intake down to 124 ^_^ which makes me pleased. somewhat. this of course will not help when i will have gained again. god i hate this stuff sometimes...       but anyway, i have managed to stay off laxies since sunday evening. that's three whole days. of course i haven't eaten during those three days. in fact i've not eaten for five days. i've reached the point where it becomes easy. interesting - i never thought i'd make it there again. now i will just have to wait and see if i start losing. because i'm not counting those 2 lbs. not yet. only if they will stay off.       tomorrow i will record my failure here.      O_O

       it's so unfair... dehydration and rehydration both cause headache. is there NO WAY of getting out of it? O_O      i'm just finishing my third day on all liquids. no weight loss yet. i keep telling myself that this is what i get for taking laxies every day for months. i'm most likely right. i wish i would listen to myself sometimes... cos there are times when that really is a wise choice.      the trip i will take in a few days makes me nervous - it started to make me nervous today, to be honest. it didn't before. the reason i'm nervous? big surprise: FOOD AND POSSIBLE FEEDERS. i have no idea what i'm walking into. i have to hope for the best and look forward to the worst, like i always do. i really REALLY hope that i can keep up with my plan while i'm gone. i think that if it's all up to me, i will definitely make it. if other people get in the way though... O_O      i really don't want anyone to get in the way.      O_O
