Honestly most of us don't think of goodbye's as a big deal until the day comes you put it off and like yeah what ever I still have a cpl of days to talk with them or see them, I know that I do that alot and it sucks becuase you realize how much your going to miss a person or people when you see them for that last time it's not a cool feeling! It sucks even more when you have to say&nbsp;three good bye's in one day. Today I had to say bye to my best freind Scott who is my youth pastor, mentor, older bro,and above all else an awesome person that has always been then through the thick and thin he is one of those kind of people that makes you take look at your self realize what your doing is wrong and then totally change man, also the Holy Spirit has a bunch to do with that,then after thats all over you feel totally awesome bout yourself!&nbsp;I also had to say bye to his wife Jenn who is an awesome person she &nbsp;rocks, she has always also been there for me when I needed to talk to her or eat her AWESOME FOOD!    The third good bye I had to say was to a new but very special person in my life Treena, She's one of those girls that can encourage you through anything and have a weird way of making you feel driffrent like you can actually be yourself. I dont know bout all you other guys but she rocks. I think this good bye sadend me alot becuase we've grown close in a few months and now have to say bye. But its all good the Holy Spirit is doing this for a reason and so he is taking care of me 100% of the way. All of tonite pretty much was fun except for saying bye but it had to be done and I can say for certain that one day we will all meet again!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Ahhh the Great Outdoors!     For those of you that do not know when I lived in Utah for a couple of months I happened to stumble upon a new hobby, and that is hunting copmound bow hunting to be exact. It's super fun as a sport and there's nothing like taking down your own Elk or White Tale Deer. Now some of you will probablly call me a monster but that's ok I guess lol. Now the reason I'm telling you all this is becuase when I move to Illinois I'm going to get back into hunting again I know some people there that do and own their own private land so were going to start hunting soon I hope. It'll be fun I hope, I guess I'm lucky in a way that God is setting me up with a life in which I can do the things I enjoy. It is cool I really mean it I guess I'll say it again God Rocks!!!

I mean of course I care It's my life and stuff but I'm actually excited . I'll be headed there with an open mind, I guess in the past couple of weeks I've been thinking to my self "You know Baji there is a reason your doing all this moving about you don't know it yet but God is so doing something in your life right now". I can't see it yet of course like all people we tend to get mad at him for the short outcome but I did not even waste my time on that I went straight for&nbsp;there's a bigger picture. Yet I dont know it thats fine God will be there to take care of my needs as long as I meet him half way I guess he ROCKS!!!!!!!   But yeah im&nbsp;moving to O.C. (Orange&nbsp;County) on the 23rd of July then to&nbsp;Charleston, Illinois on the 30th of&nbsp;July.   Well thanks for taking time out of your ohhh so busy day to read this boring junk...j/k  &nbsp;
