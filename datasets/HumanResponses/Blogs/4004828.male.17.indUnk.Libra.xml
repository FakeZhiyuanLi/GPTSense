       Moving from Dublin, Ireland to Bulgaria is a drag so what pick me up is better than starting a new journal? Well, I can think of a few like drugs, sex, and rock and roll, but this'll have to do for now.&nbsp; Dad moved us all here because being the President of O'Grady Pharmaceudicals Inc. he has to supervise and take part in all the research.&nbsp; They're testing a new drug which could be a breakthrough in the field and requires some rare fungus.&nbsp; The only probably is that the damn thing is only found in Bulgaria.&nbsp; Oh well, might as well make the best of it.&nbsp; At least we've moved into a bigger house.&nbsp; Things should go nicely moving here except a few minor details...  The first few days of school have been eventful to say the least.&nbsp; Promptly upon walking into the Entrance Hall I have girls falling at my feet.&nbsp; What can I say? I know I should be used to it, but one does love to be flattered.&nbsp; Okay enough of the ego booster, but seriously, in no more than five steps into the hall, I had two girls fall to my feet...literally! One busted her head open and the other spilled her belongings all over the ground.&nbsp; Being the gentleman that I am I of course, helped them get their stuff back together and made their aquentance.&nbsp; Both are very nice and attractive girls, except I think I fancy Ginny better.  Then I met the only male on the face of the Earth to PMS.&nbsp; Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, a priick with mood swings wider than the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; He made a very odd impression on me and it seemed that as soon as he came everything went from odd, to odder.&nbsp; First he went around coldly looking down upon me and then he completely lost his head and kept sneering at me.&nbsp; Later he went further to be apologetic, and finally he adopted a nervous attitude and asked Ginny out...right in front of me!&nbsp; I certainly hope his parents aren't paying too much for his psychologist because IT ISN'T WORKING! I wonder how many bi-polar people there are at this school.  Speaking of bi...I met a set of twins.&nbsp; Neither of them bi-polar, just 100% bitch.&nbsp; Pureblood elite, and as you can imagine, neither of them fancied me very much.&nbsp; My first encounter with them happened while I was exploring the dungeons.&nbsp; I was hoping to find something of interest, but only managed to get myself lost.&nbsp; Of course the twins should come to grace me though.&nbsp; Did I mention that they're hot though? Well, they are, along with every other girl in the school... ::droolz:: I think I'm gonna like it here! ;)  But anyways, back to my story, later I found them in the forest plotting some sadistic scheme of theirs and when I harassed them a bit, the elder one thought it would be fun to punch me, kick me, and then curse me.&nbsp; With a bloody nose and boils popping up all over me there wasn't much I could do.&nbsp; Besides, I would NEVER hit a girl no matter what she did to me.&nbsp; Limping back to the castle I tended to my bloody nose.&nbsp; At least it's not broken and it's not swelling.&nbsp;  That's all so far from the crazy life of Brenton O'Grady, so until quill meets parchment again, I'll be out finding more haters and getting into more trouble.&nbsp; See ya.
