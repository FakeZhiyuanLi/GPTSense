      Why is it that every year, towards the end of summer, July feels like a distant memory? I feel like i never accomplish anything in the two months i have off. We went to wasaga and a couple of day trips here and there, but i never feel like i've done something worth doing. Next summer, I want to take that job on a cruise ship before school. I need to be alone and experience the world by myself for once. I need to learn not to depend on anyone else and to see everything in my eyes. An entire summer without friends, family or Woodbridge....thats what i need.  -j

      He seems to be fine...considering the situation. Of course, I didnt say hi....Christina did. But atleast I know he's ok. It's so bizarre that this is happening. Whta if he and I had gotten serious....I would probably be a mess right now. I guess its sort of a blessing because I wouldnt be worried about him. But I do sometimes miss laughing with him. We should have stayed closer...as friends. Maybe I didnt give him a chance. Maybe he was a great guy and I was the idiot. Or, maybe, I just feel this way because of what Nat told Christina. Who knows....  -j

      I feel numb all over. What do you do when a guy you were dating, who you dont see alot and hardly talk to, finds out he has cancer? He didnt tell me, a mutual friend did. But really...someone should make an etiquette book on this stuff. He probably doenst know i know. Do i email him? do i call? do i send him a bear and balloons? (hope not)....do I get in touch with him to say hi? I feel sick....I care about him, but what do you do when you arent a main fixture in each other's life? Ignore the fact?  -j

      Whispers of madness of unstable thoughts. Hungering for one rock of strength. Naughts of twisted limbs. Broken hearts with no place to go. Lost in a sea of wonder.  -j

      This is the thing about being single and being me. You tend to have crushes. And i dont mean "ohhhh he's sooo cute" kind of crushes. I mean "disappointed when he is not what you expect" kind of crushes. Or my personal favourite "right guy, wrong time" crushes. Or the one that everyone knows about "he doesnt know that i exist" crushes.   -j

      I finally found an easier way to write and here it is. A blog. I never thought as myself as one of those internet types. I used it for research, catching up with friends and screwing around. But never once would I be the type to put myself out for the world to see. I like being me and being without judgement.  I'm sitting with my back to a re-run of Sex and the City. My mind is in a wondering state at the moment. I'm beginning to think that I'll never get to where i want to be. It's weird. I have realized that for most people, life is an everyday struggle. I dont want my llife to be like that. Sure, I expect sadness and tragedy because heaven knows i'm not immune to it. But I want to be happy. And i feel like the only way I can be is if I live this house and this town and be on my own. It wont be forever or anytime soo for that matter. But I dont want to be fifty years old and have regrets about not following my dreams. Seems a little dramatic, i know. But i look around at the adults in my life and most are not happy with the lives they have created. I never, ever wnat to be like that.  -j
