      This has become my 'song of the moment'. I think that its the broken down part that appeals to me.  Standing Still - Jewel  Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights  Try to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here  To the twilight  There's a dead end to my left  There's a burning bush to my right  You aren't in sight  You aren't in sight  Do you want me  Like I want you  Or am I standing still  Beneath a darkened sky  Or am I standing still  With the scenery flying by  Or am I standing still  Out of the corner of my eye  Was that you passing me by  Mothers on the stoop  Boys in souped-up coupes  On this hot summer night  Between fight and flight  Is the blind man's sight  And a choice that's right  I roll the window down  Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town  Feel broken down

      Extravagant Spirits BY MAYA ANGELOU  Without their fierce devotion We are fragile and forlorn, Stumbling briefly, among the stars. We and our futures belong to them Exquisitely, our beliefs and our Breaths are made tangible in their love.  By their extravagant spirits, they draw us From the safe borders And into the center of the center ring There they urge dance upon our Leaden feet And to our sullen hearts, Bright laughter.  Not the crowd's roar nor the gasped Breath of the timorous can stay their mission.  There is no moderation in their nature. They spit upon their fingers To test the wind of history, They slip into our bonds and steal us Away from the slavery of cowardice.  They skin back their thin lips over fanged teeth and Rocks in hand, in our presence Face down our Goliath.  These mothers, fathers, pastors and priests, These Rabbis, Imams and gurus, Teach us by their valor and mold us with their courage.  Without their fierce devotion We are only forlorn and only fragile Stumbling briefly, among the stars.

      The following is an excerpt from Rudolph W. Giuliani's words about the September 11, 2001 attack on the USA.    "We have met the worst of humanity with the best of humanity." an excerpt BY RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI  On the morning of September 11, 2001, the United States of America awoke to find itself under attack.  In the City of New York, hijacked commercial airliners were crashed into the World Trade Center. Less than two hours later, both 110-story Twin Towers collapsed, killing some 5,000 innocent men, women and children. It was the deadliest day in American history, costing more lives than the attack on Pearl Harbor or D-Day.In the aftermath of this unimaginable tragedy, New Yorkers, and all Americans, have united as never before. Inspired by countless examples of courage and generosity, we have met the worst of humanity with the best of humanity. The darkest day in our long history has led to our finest hour.   I was having breakfast in midtown when I received word that the first plane had hit the northern tower. It was a clear blue-sky day, but some New Yorkers still held on to the hope that the crash could have been a terrible accident. When the second plane began its deadly descent into the southern tower, we knew that we were under attack.   I arrived at the western base of the World Trade Center to witness the most horrific scene of my life—the buildings were burning, shooting flames and black smoke toward the sky, while debris and human beings fell to the ground. The firefighters and police were already there and the rescue effort was under way. New York's Bravest and New York's Finest were doing what they always do—running toward danger. Among these were the most decorated men in the Fire Department, living legends such as First Deputy Commissioner Bill Feehan, Chief of the Department Pete Ganci, the Department Chaplain Father Mychal Judge, and the rising star of Manhattan's Rescue 1 Squad, Captain Terry Hatton. The best of the Bravest put themselves in the gravest danger. Like many thousands, they would never be seen alive again.   The magnitude of the horror is still hard to comprehend. Those proud Twin Towers that crowned our skyline for a quarter century no longer stand. Even more devastating is the loss of thousands of individuals who were killed in the attack. All were innocent. All were heroes.  Those who went to work in the World Trade Center on September 11 were engaged in the quiet heroism of supporting their families, pursuing their dreams and playing their own meaningful part in a diverse, dynamic and free society. We will never know many of the selfless acts of courage that occurred among them that day, but they will occupy a sacred place in our hearts and in our history. They will never be forgotten.  The brave men and women who entered the Twin Towers to save those inside are already recognized as heroes for the ages. Survivors of the attack speak of stairwells crowded with people determined to get downstairs to safety, while firefighters, police officers, and other emergency workers were going in the opposite direction—running upstairs toward danger, toward the heart of the fire, determined to save lives. Three hundred forty-three members of the New York City Fire Department lost their lives on September 11—a devastating blow to a Department that had lost 778 men since it was founded in 1865. Members of the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority Police, EMS workers and court officers also made great sacrifices amid startling acts of bravery. Not a single one of those heroes died in vain. Their courage, selflessness and professionalism saved more than 25,000 lives that day—making it the most successful rescue operation in our nation's history. These were true American patriots. They gave their lives in defense of our liberty.

      So I have to admit that things in this household have gotten a bit crazy to say the least. I think that our household is not unlike many other Americans. I find it incredibly ironic that, as I sit here writing this, I am sprung from my computer. A noise, although I'm not quite sure what the noise is. It's really loud, almost like there is a lawnmower going around my house. I jump out of my chair and fling open the front door. I step out onto our front porch coming to the realization that the noise is a plane, flying very low, bringing me to a dead halt. I think that my reactions are completely "normal" considering what we, as a nation have gone through. I find it reassuring to know that there are other people, who, like me, are on a heightened sense of security...And I'm not just talking about the security that Donald Rumsfield is asking us to be at, I feel more alert than what my country is asking me to be. I used to let planes come and go over my house without a second thought. Now it seems that I'm double-checking to make sure what I hear is actually a plane, not just some figment of my imagination. I have never noticed so many planes flying over my house on a regular daily basis. Now it seems as if I notice them more and more. I have to say that I have been very lucky not to have had to experienced the type of horror that terrorist attacks brought into our every day lives. What our country has suffered is more pain than I could ever face. It's funny how we can sit and preach and tell people not to promote hate crimes and try to be so politically correct. It's funny how we, as Americans cant remember our lives on September 10. We have been forever changed, grown stronger, gained a sense of American pride that was lost just a few weeks ago. I can never forget what we have been through. I can never explain why I am so proud to be an American. But I can think of it the way my grandparents tried to explain patriotism to me years ago. I tried to listen, but all I heard was a bunch of non-politically-correct words. Now I understand them.

      WALK ON -  urlLink U2   And love is not the easy thing The only baggage you can bring... And love is not the easy thing....  The only baggage you can bring  Is all that you can't leave behind  And if the darkness is to keep us apart  And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off And if your glass heart should crack  And for a second you turn back  Oh no, be strong  Walk on, walk on  What you got they cant steal it  No they cant even feel it  Walk on, walk on...  Stay safe tonight  You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been  A place that has to be believed to be seen  You could have flown away  A singing bird in an open cage  Who will only fly, only fly for freedom  Walk on, walk on  What you've got they can't deny it  Cant sell it, cant buy it  Walk on, walk on  Stay safe tonight  And I know it aches  And your heart it breaks And you can only take so much  Walk on, walk on  Home hard to know what it is if youve never had one  Home I cant say where it is but I know I'm going home  That's where the hurt is  I know it aches  How your heart it breaks  And you can only take so much  Walk on, walk on  Leave it behind  You've got to leave it behind  All that you fashion All that you make All that you build All that you break All that you measure All that you feel All this you can leave behind  All that you reason - it's only time  All that I'm feeling on my mind All that you sense, All that you scheme, All you dress-up, And all that you see, All you create, All that you wreck All that you hate All that you can't leace behind

      i think that i need to find my cynical little bitch that i have inside of me. she has gotten a lot smaller lately. and i think that she is about to have a huge growth spurt. I'm getting quite annoyed with trusting people and believing in what people tell me only to be let down. i feel like i have been let down a lot lately and that i have come to a point where i dont want to trust anyone at all. i mean, there are few (and i mean like 4 or 5) people that i feel like i can trust with everything    "life used to be life-like now it's more like show biz i wake up in the night and i don't know where the bathroom is and i don't know what town I'd in or what sky i am under and i wake up in the darkness and i  don't have the will anymore to wonder everyone has a skeleton and a closet to keep it in and you're mine every song has a you a you that the singer sings to and you're it this time baby, you're it this time when i need to wipe my face i use the back of my hand and i like to take up space just because i can and i use my dress to wipe up my drink i care less and less what people think and you are so lame  you always disappoint me it's kinda like our running joke but it's really not funny i just want you to live up to the image of you i create i see you and I'd so unsatisfied i see you and i dilate so I'll walk the plank and I'll jump with a smile if I'm gonna go down I'm gonna do it with style and you won't see me surrender  you won't hear me confess  'cuz you've left me with nothing but I've worked with less and i learn every room long enough to make it to the door and then i hear it click shut behind me and every key works differently i forget every time and the forgetting defines me  that's what defines me when i say you sucked my brain out the English translation  is i am in love with you  and it is no fun but i don't use words like love 'cuz words like that don't matter but don't look so offended you know, you should be flattered i wake up in the night in some big hotel bed my hands grope for the light my hands grope for my head the world is my oyster the road is my home and i know that I'm better  off alone" -ani difranco-

       there are certain times in our lives where you just need reassurance. whether it be an old friend or a family member or even writing them into a blog to put on your web site so that your thoughts are out there in the great unknown. just words on page really. I'll be the first one to admit that i was not the nicest of all the girls in high school. some would even say i was a huge bitch. and i know that is not too far from the truth. i don't think that high school is a useful tool for judging one's character. with all the hormones and confusion, i completely understand now what i was feeling then. not to say that i can relate to any of the kids that are in high school, because i honestly think that in five years a lot can change. but thats an entirely separate entry. although i wasn't the nicest person back then, i think that i have changed a lot over the past five years. not to say that it has been all that easy...i mean every once in a while that sixteen year old girl comes out and starts throwing temper tantrums about how she has to be able to return the pair of shoes. but i never apologized to people that i may have hurt. and thinking about it now, i still wont apologize for my actions. not to say that they were justified. but i think that instead of apologizing and saying the words that people have come to take for granted, i put my apologies into actions. and i became a nicer person. my patience is another step that i have to work on. i think that because i have become a nicer person, i feel more of a need for this reassurance from others. and i have to say that i hate that about myself now. i mean, i kind of feel like i have regressed. i feel like i was once this strong-take-no-shit-from-anyone(and I MEAN ANYONE) girl into this young woman who is searching for acceptance into the places that she once thumbed her nose at. aim not talking about trendy bars or up-tight restaurants, but i mean the people that surround me in my life. and even the ones who just pass in and out. i think that right now is one of those times where my words have to go into the great unknown so that i can feel the reassurance that i am so searching for right now. i need to know that at the end of the day that everything will be okay. sometimes i just wish that i was stupid so that i never had the capability to analyze things a billion times over.

      I have been looking for a new VWBeetle convertible since I saw Austin Powers driving one around. Let's just say that I have been to the VW dealership my fair share of times asking when they are coming out with them in America. And every time that I ask, I get the same answer, 'Miss we know that they are going to come out with them, we just don't know  when .' And even though I do not speak Deutch?, I think that a very sweet boy may have sent me on the correct path. I swore to myself that once I saw the opportunity for this car, that I would own it. It's been something that I have really wanted. And I know that certain car dealerships in America 'modify' the new Beetles into the Cab's but I also know that  'modifications such as these will void my warranty.'    urlLink Beetles Revival   There is a rumor going around about a small company, nestled in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany, which not only produces the classical beetle convertible and the new beetle convertible, but we also restore all volkswagen automobiles to their original mint condition. We, at Beetles Revival, try to maintain excellent customer service by not only giving you a quality product, but by keeping a good solid customer relationship with our experienced service and parts department. We produce from your New Beetle...the New Beetle Convertible. Beetles Revival High Lights New Beetle Convertible as a new car Refine your New Beetle to a New Beetle Convertible Beetles Revival Show Rooms aautomobile dealer Kamps in Witten VW-Center in Leipzig autobobile dealer Jacobs in Aachen New Beetle Cabriolet On that IAA in Frankfurt am Main, we for the first time presented the New Beetle convertible the public in September 1999. Approximately 20 vehicles produced individually left our workshop since then, among other things, a Show-Car for the motion picture film "Austin Powers" as well as the "Beetster" in Co-Produktion with Kamei. They can command your dream convertible with us as a producing vehicle or you deliver your New Beetle as a basic vehicle.Ihre individual wishes in equipment can let us flowing completely into our small production!

      I don't know if it's the fact that some of these "artists" but the most obscure things that I have ever heard of on their list. I have been hooked on finding out what all these famous musicians have ordered in their riders.    urlLink Red Hot Chili Peppers :  Meditation Room: All walls pipe and draped med to dark color please (prefer not blue) per advance.  After ordering all this 'healthy crap like soy yogurt, flavored rice cakes and yogurt and carob covered raisins...they ordered a box of Lucky Charms? White Socks, Black Socks, Boxers, TShirts (is this the alternative to having your mother buy that stuff for you)    urlLink Backstreet Boys : 16 32oz bottles of water for stage NO GAS (what does no gas mean?)   urlLink Puffy : Hennesey, Alize, Milk, Cristal, Dom Perignon  MY PERSONAL FAVORITE: urlLink  Jennifer Lopez : White Room, White flowers, White tables and/or tablecloths, White drapes, White candles, White couches Flowers: Yellow roses with Red Trim (*$55.00 for 10) White Lilies (*$45.00 for 6) White Roses (*$65.00 for 12) Diptyque Candles: (*sell for $42.00 each)Tuberous, Figure, Heliotrope Music:About 25 CD's  In summary, can I be a rock star?!?! I mean...their riders have more things on them than my Christmas Lists!!   urlLink The Smoking Gun Backstage Pass   Over the past couple of years, The Smoking Gun has published excerpts from the backstage riders of a few dozen performers. But that assemblage has not been extensive enough for demanding TSG visitors, so we've gone out and obtained loads of new riders. So many, in fact, that our backstage collection now covers a whopping 134 acts--everyone from Frank Sinatra and the Rolling Stones to Kenny G and KC & the Sunshine Band. The contract rider includes specifications on stage design, sound systems, lighting rigs, as well as an artist's wish list--from transportation and billing to dressing room accommodations and meals. In some cases, a promoter will refuse a demand (crossing out the request on the document), though stars usually get what they want, whether it's clean boxer shorts (Jane's Addiction), prune juice (Kansas), or an arrangement of tulips, roses, gardenias, and lilies (Janet Jackson). For some groups, TSG has obtained riders from more than one tour, so we've chosen excerpts from the most entertaining document in the lot. In addition, we've used red arrows to point out some interesting sections on individual riders--though we're sure you'll find many other personal favorites. And since we've now built a permanent home for these backstage documents, we'll add riders to this section as we obtain them, so check back to see what's new.

      It's not like I'm totally like this all the time ;) And so what if I have a few things in common with a sorority bitch? What-Ever! I still thought that this was funny.   urlLink I am a sorority bitch.   THIS IS A FUNNY THING THAT ONE OF MY SORORITY SISTERS E-MAILED US AS A JOKE... I THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS CUZ ITS TOTALLY THE SORORITY GIRL STEREOTYPE. BUT THAT STEREOTYPE IS SO NOT TRUE! (well maybe a few LOL but nothing too bad!)  I am a sorority bitch. I wear gucci sunglasses. I have a Kate Spade Purse. I fake bake. I binge drink. I don't go to class. I shack. I have lots of different guys' boxers because I shack. I drink lots of hard alcohol I spend hours doing my hair before I go to class so I can get that "messy" look. I go to the gym with makeup on. My hair looks perfect when I am at the gym. I go to the gym in pure spandex. I act like I'm working out really hard when I am at the gym, but really I am only checking out frat boys. I have a frat boy boyfriend. I only associatewith frat boys. I shack at frat houses. You will see me walking down fraternity row in my black platforms and a tube top and capri pants at 11 am on Sunday morning because I just woke up. I diet. I eat salads and lots of chocolate cake. I don't know all of my professors names, but I know all the names of famous designers. I wear calvin clein underwear.. at least it will look good when it's on the floor. I have a cell phone. I talk on my cell phone on the way to class. My cell phone often rings in class. People know I am popular because my cell phone rings so much. My cell phone has many different colored fronts to match all of my outfits. I throw up in Frat bathrooms. I drink jungle juice. I take shots. I sleep in class. I watch 90210. I go out every night. I complain about Monday night meetings. I talk about everyone. I gossip about my sisters. I drink too much. I want daddy to send me more money. I shop at Nordstroms. My liscence plate says Princess. I drive a cool sports car. I have a prada bag. I spend more money on my purses than you did on your computer. You wish you were like me. I know if you were really cool you would rush. If you did rush and dropped, we didn't want you anyway. I wear cute clothes to go get my mail. I wear sorority tee-shirts everywhere, but especially to the gym. I know where the mall is but I don't know where to register for classes. I have sex with frat boys. I talk about how wasted I was last night really loud in class. I was really wasted last night. I always know what's going on. And if it's going on and I don't know about it, it must not be cool. I will ask you what house you're in and I will try not to laugh if your house sucks... or if your not in a house at all, wow, I'm really sorry. What do you do if you're not in a house? Do you go out if you're not in a house? Do you have any friends? Where on earth do you go to drink? I get my hair highlighted. I have a Tiffany's bracelet with my name engraved on it. I only use my computer to email people. I only get good grades on papers because there are copies of them in my house. I am on academic probation. I have lots of frat guys phone numbers on my tack board. I cherish the greek pages. I talk about my house in class. I will ask you about your house in class. I will let everyone know what sorority I'm in. I make out with fraternity boys at frat parties. I can be found at a frat house on any given night at 1:30 am. Late night, duh. I have the perfect outfit for every date dash. At pimps and hoes I don't even have to dress up. I am a jammavibrator, a dick grabber, a chi hoe, a Dog Pound, a dirty girl, a Tri- Dump, a Visa Visa Master Card. I smoke on the front porch of my sorority house. I have a cigarette case to make all of my kenneth cole shoes. I have MAC make up. I have thousands of photographs. I am kissing a frat boy or drinking alcohol in 80 percent of the photos. In the other 20 percent I am too drunk to hold a beer any more or I just got finished kissing a frat boy. If you have a frat boy boyfriend and you're not in a house he's probably getting on me when you're not around. I like getting on other people's boyfriends. It makes me feel really good about myself. Because I am prettier than you, I sure as hell dress better than you, and dammit, I'm cooler than you. I’m a sorority bitch.

        Stem cells technique offers MS hope   Stem cell research has led to a possible treatment for multiple sclerosis. The new technique involves taking stem cells from the patient's blood, killing the ones working against the immune system and returning the healthy ones to the body. Scientists say 26 people with severe MS have undergone the treatment, which is called autologous stem cell transplantation. Within 14 months, 20 had their conditions stablised and six showed some mild improvement. Conventional treatments had previously failed for all of the patients. However, three of the patients died during the study due to complications following the procedure. The treatment is now being tested on more patients to confirm its effectiveness and study its long-term effect. The research was presented during the American Academy of Neurology's 54th Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado. Dr George Kraft, of the University of Washington Medical Centre in Seattle, led the study. He said: "This is good news. These patients had all been rapidly deteriorating over the past year, so to get them to a point where they are stabilised is great progress." Dr Kraft added: "The hope is that these stem cells will eventually reconstitute into healthy immune system cells and the disease process can be stopped."Stem cells can develop into any of the body's other cells and may one day be used to cure a variety of illnesses.

      Ok I know that these are completely hypocritical ideas. I went to a concert back in '99 and I bought one of her cd's (even thought I do "own" all of them thanks to the miracle of mp3s and a cd burner). Maybe its the fact that the press has been so overly-obsessed with her and Justin. Maybe its that I think she is given far far too much credit for shakin her butt and lip-syncing. Or maybe its that I think about who I idolized as a little girl and I think of  urlLink Debbie(now Deborah) Gibson  (i don't think i ever saw her elbows) and maybe  urlLink Madonna . And yes Madonna was totally risque but she was also 26 when she did 'Like a Virgin'. And it wasn't until she was 32 when she had the  urlLink Blonde Ambition Tour . Back to my point. We are talking about a young girl in her early twenties. A time when the craziness starts to come out of all of us. Isn't that everyone's twenties? But at the same time someone who is in the constant spotlight and KNOWS that little girls look up to her the same way that she looked up to  urlLink Janet  and Madonna. So yes it does piss me off a when I see my 7 year old cousin crouched down on the floor air-humping an imaginary pole and claiming that its the 'Britney Dance'. And with that in mind, I give you more of my opinions.  Hypothetical Situation:  2005 - Britney loses her voice(lol) and can't make another song ever again. Her 4th divorce has just been finalized and her husband got all the money. Not qualified to do any kind of real job, she decides she wants to audition as a stripper.  But does she meet the requirements?  Britney v. The Stripper     urlLink Dyed hair    Looks like a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON urlLink without makeup .

"I would never pierce anything.  Belly rings are like so old."   A local DJ, "Would you get anything pierced?" Britney, "Nooo way would I get anything fake on my body."   " I think just being pure and doing nothing to destroy your body is cool. I think thats what's in right now."

      And the sick thing is that I think this actually sounds fun. What kind of a warped mind thinks such things?!?   urlLink :: MAXIM ONLINE :: Office Drinking Game   Oh, like you’re so productive anyway.  You know that six pack that’s been chilling in your office fridge for the past eight months, waiting for that “special occasion” that never comes? Well, if you’ve got the cajones (and the financial stability to accept unemployment) we suggest you grab that mystery lager and have yourself some fun on company time.   The Rules  If you’re drinking at work, it’s pretty safe to say that all bets are off. Maxim Online accepts no responsibility for your dumb ass getting fired.   Take One Drink When…    Every time someone’s abandoned cell phone rings.    You pass a desk or cubicle, causing the guy sitting there to hastily close out of the porn site he was just on.    You’re asked to “brainstorm.”    Every time your computer crashes or freezes. (Take an extra drink every time the tech support guys tell you, “We’ll be right up.”)   You receive a “chain e-mail” from the office religious nut.   Someone’s hangover/burrito relief has befouled the restroom.   You see someone with more than one framed photo/stuffed animal/action figure near their computer.     Take Two Drinks When…    Anyone uses the terms “blue-sky,” “evergreen,” or “proactive.”   The fax and/or copy machine is out of service.   Someone’s lunch is potent enough to stink up the whole office.    The bulletin board features any of the following: “Roommate wanted” ads, fire safety instructions, or embarrassing candid photos of employees.   Someone admits to having “cc’d” or “bcc’d” someone else.     Do a Shot When…    Your boss calls you by someone else’s name. (Take an extra shot if it’s the office fuck-up’s)    Something in the communal refrigerator has rotted so badly, you can’t even tell what it used to be.    The hot temp turns you down. Again.    The mailroom “misplaces” your Maxim. Again.   Someone gets “downsized” (Take unlimited shots if it’s you).

      Beastie Boys set to record Hello Nasty follow-up   The  urlLink Beastie Boys  are planning to record a new album.   urlLink Ananova Story filed: 15:40 Monday 10th December 2001   I am so super duper happy that they're coming out with a new album. I think that I wore out my copy of  urlLink 'The Sounds of Science' (its a double-cd set) . Not to mention the aimple fact that I love them   The album will be the follow-up to their 1998 album Hello Nasty. The group are to start work in the recording studio early next year. Beasties DJ Mixmaster Mike told  urlLink Rolling Stone  that the group have been working on new material in New York and Los Angeles.  He said: "Right now, we're at the incubation stage. We've got all the beats in the incubator. They're eggs. We're waiting for them to hatch. Me and Mike D are just like, politicking. We're very moody players. We're moody musicians. You never know what's gonna come out of it."

      Star Wars, Attach of the Clones has only been released in the theaters for 4 days. And movie-mistakes have already found over 40 mistakes. This is so unbelievable to me. I mean, not to say that movies don't have their mistakes. They all do. I remember watching the "Wizard of Oz" looking for the munchkin hanging in the tree and I remember watching "Three Men and A Baby" looking for the 'guy in the window who had killed himself'. I understand that there are flaws. But 40 of them? I honestly think that sometimes these flaws may be used as a marketing appeal. Maybe the producers want to see if they can make a few extra dollars, etc... And we usually fall for it. I know that I certainly am not the only one who looked for the munchin or the window man. Especially considersing that I had heard it fom 'someone who had seen it'. Small mistakes, little marketing tactics, I can get. But did they watch this movie or screen a test audience before they released it? I'm not making ANY claim to be a Star Wars nerd. But I would think that you would want some of those people to watch your movie FOR you before you release it. Maybe the Star Wars fans are a little over the top. Maybe they know a little TOO much about the stories and the books and the movies, etc... But aren't those the same people who make sure that they see your movie right away? Aren't they the ones who buy the dvd even though they saw it like 6 times in the theatre?   urlLink Star Wars: Attack of the (Mistaken) Clones   Attack of the Clones (2002) Directed by George  urlLink Lucas   According to Movie-Mistakes.com, here are the Most-Mistake Ridden Movies  Rank Film Number of mistakes 1 - The Matrix - 146 2 - Titanic - 135 3 - Spider-Man - 123 4 - Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring - 117 5 - Jurassic Park - 95 6 - Gladiator - 93 7 - Terminator 2: Judgment Day - 89 8 - Pearl Harbor - 79  9 -  urlLink Star Wars  - 78   10 - Independence Day - 76 11 - Top Gun - 73 12 - The Wizard of Oz - 72 13 - The Mummy Returns - 67 14 - Saving Private Ryan - 67 15 - Austin Powers: Spy Who Shagged Me - 63 16 - Charlie's Angels - 62 17 - Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade - 62 18 - Raiders of the Lost Ark - 62  19 -  urlLink Return of the Jedi  - 60  20 - Braveheart - 54   urlLink Attack of the Clones  - 42  1. When Padme gets her back scratched she seems to bleed. Even though she is wearing all white, and the scratches seems to be deep, her white top remains squeaky clean during the rest of the movie and does not get dirty from her wound. 2. How is it that one slash on Amidala's back ripped off the entire midriff of her shirt, and both of her sleeves? 3. When Anakin is fighting the geonosis guards in the droid factory, he does a backwards roll to avoid being hit, while doing so he rolls right on one of the molten pieces of metal on the conveyor belt... 4. When Anakin jumps off the speeder when they are chasing Zen the assassin and drops to land on Zen's craft, you can see a bulge in the back of his costume that is obviously the shackle which the cable that is holding him is attached to. 5. On Tatooine when Anakin first gets on to the swoop bike, two legs which the bike is standing (hovering) on is visible. This is even so while he is racing along tatooine landscape. These legs are no longer visible when he returns with Shmi. 6. During the sequence where Obi-wan goes to meet Yoda regarding the abscence of Kamino from the Jedi Archives, look closely at the collection of children Yoda is training. While most are human, there is one that is alien, with a reptilian face of dark skin. He sure moves fast, because at first he is at the back in the centre of the group of trainees, in the next shot he is at the fron of the group of trainees, and by the end of the scene, he is on the far left, yet we never see him, or any of the other children, move. 7. After the fight scene between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett at Kamino, as Jango runs up the walkway into his ship, the door closes from above and knocks Jango in the head as he enters. I'm fairly sure that who shot is computer generated, so it must have been deliberate - a little nod to the Storm trooper in Star Wars, perhaps? 8. After landing at Geonosis to save Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme have a brief discussion in the ship next to C3PO and R2D2. Then they walk down the small hall and exit the ship to the right. R2 and C3PO then have a discussion. A few moments later R2 and 3PO leave the ship...but exit to the left. 9. When Yoda and Mace listen to the Senate voting Palpatine emergency powers, Yoda starts on the top ledge nearest the Senate chamber. When the shot changes he has moved down onto a different ledge which wasn't there before. 10. In the arena battle, the creature that looks like a crab is a complete StarCraft rip off of the Lurker - click here to see it. 11. Just a small visual error on behalf of computer animation. On Geonesis, after Anakin and Senator Amidala get out of the ship in the steamvent area. Anakin ducks under a doorway on his way into the droid production factory, but if you look closely, his head goes "through" the doorway a bit. This is most likely due to the fact that the doorway was computer generated onto a blue screen, and "Anakin" didn't duck correctly. 12. In the arena scene, Anakin's pillar already has a chain hanging from the top before he is led to it, however, when he is led to the pillar, the chain is no longer there, and a new one is hoisted to the top by the flying Geonosian guard. 13. When Obi-Wan goes to the water planet and talks to the Prime Minister in his office. The alien is of course computer generated. When the actors do their blue screen work, markers are put up for them to look at so that when the finished shot is done, and the alien is put in, it looks like they're looking at the alien. In this scene, Obi-Wan is clearly not looking at the alien. (On one of the "making of" trailers at starwars.com you can hear George Lucas jokingly say "Eye-lines! I don't care about no stinking eye-lines," and the scene behind him is Obi-Wan talking to the alien...) 14. When C3PO losses his head in the droid factory. He wanders toward the assembly line, filled with droids being fit with heads. Suddenly he is shown stepping into an open spot on the previously full conveyor. Where did this "open space" come from? 15. When Obi-wan tries to apprehend Jango fett, Jango has 2 blasters. What happens to the other one, after it shows one blaster knocked to the ledge? 16. On Tatooine when Anakin first gets on to the swoop bike, two legs which the bike is standing (hovering) on is visible. This is even so while he is racing along tatooine landscape. These legs are no longer visible when he returns with Shmi's body. 17. In the introduction, when text flows across the screen, the words "ten thousand solar systems" appear. Strictly speaking, there is only one Solar system - ours. A star with planets is a "star system", our star is called "Sol", hence, the Solar System. This trivial error is made in many sci-fi films, BUT the Star Wars series has never fallen into this error before. Remember Episode IV, where Leia says something like, "The more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers" (and that's only one example). So why, why, why has George Lucas allowed such a trivial but irksome error to be made here? 18. Earlier in the movie Padme is packing her luggage to leave Coruscant (while she is talking to Anakin). In one shot she has a red folded garment in her hands and in the next one she is putting some dark stuff into her case. 19. When Obi-Wan is on Geonosis secretly listening to Count Dooku's plan with the seperatists. If Dooku is such a great Jedi/Sith wouldn't he be able to sense Obi-Wan there listening? 20. When Dooku tries to make the tower fall on Ben and Anakin, why does Yoda struggle so much to levitate it and move it out the way, when in episode V he gives Luke a lecture about things not being heavy for a Jedi? 21. During the scene in which Anakin Skywalker is en route to the Tusken camp in search of his mother, in which he is riding a speeder bike, there is only one sun in the sky. This planet supposedly has two. 22. On Tatooine, Amidala presses a button to retransmit the message from Obi-wan. A moment later, she presses the same button to bring up the map showing Obi-wan's location and the distances between Tatooine and Couruscant. Not only does this same button do double duty, but with one press it knows she wants to show the location of the three planets. 23. When Amidala and some of the clone troopers get blown out of the ship chasing Dooku, later the trooper approaches Amidala and asks about making their way back to the front lines, but Amidala says they should go to the hangar to help Obi-Wan and Ani. How did she know about the hangar, having left the ship quite some time before it arrived at the final destination? 24. When Amidala & Anakin are eating and he cuts her a piece of the fruit and "floats" it back to her, the bite appears in the fruit a split second before she actually eats it. 25. In an early scene with Yoda talking to Mace Windu in the Jedi council room, he sits on his little Jedi throne balancing his hands atop his cane. As the shots change angle, the cane isn't there. To top it off, Yoda's hands remain as if still atop the cane... 26. In the fight scene between Yoda and Count Dooku, Jedi powers crumble part of the roof, which then falls to the floor. Later in the scene, after the hand to hand combat, the roof mess has miraculously vanished - none of it remains on the floor. 27. When Anakin and Padme are standing outside the Lars' house, we see their shadows projected on to the side of the house (with Anakin's shadow looking worryingly like Darth Vader's). However, in the next shot their shadows have moved about 4 feet to the left. 28. When Palpatine is speaking to the Jedi very near the beginning, the ships in the suspended invisible freeways on the background are always going on the same pattern. Notice that there is an elongated ship with a large rear tip, and then two smaller ships always seem to catch it at the same time. This goes on for about 3 minutes. 29. In the bar scene on Coruscant, when Anakin is tracking Zam Wessel through the bar, his Jedi braid changes sides - it is on the left side of his head in a shot where he is seen from behind. At all other times in the movie, the braid is on the right side of his head. 30. At the beginning of the scene where Anakin and Amidala are getting off the "train", R2-D2 is struggling down the stairs some way behind them. Their conversation flows continuously, but as soon as Anakin says "we've got R2 with us", R2-D2 is handily immediately behind them.   31. When Anakin is getting ready to ride off after his mother, you can see a small pile of boxes right next to his shadow that is being cast on the side of the Lars' house. Amidala comes out and we see their shadows, and the boxes have gone. Then when Anakin gets on the hoverbike and rides off, the boxes return. 32. In the scene on Geonosis where the droids are closing in on the remaining Jedi, the camera keeps cutting close and cutting back out. In only two of these changes is a blue Twilek visible. She has disappeared in the other camera angles. 33. As Padme and Anakin are about to leave their ship to save Obi-Wan right after landing in the exhaust shaft, she puts on a shawl-like piece of cloth over her shoulders facing forward. When they exit the ship, the shawl is suddenly backwards, with the two ends hanging behind her instead of in front of her. 34. At the start of the movie, when the ship on the platform explodes, it visibly knocks off one of the nubian fighters in the lower left. However, there still is the one Padme's security officer was in, and in a different shot, there are two side by side, equaling 4 fighters, but the very first few shots only show 3 escorting the senator's ship. 35. When Anakin and Padme enter the exhaust shaft, they land on a convenient landing pad. Why is there a landing pad in an exhaust shaft? 36. When Anakin is fighting Count Dooku, he takes Ben's blue light sabre in his left hand, in the next shot he is holding it in his right hand. 37. When Anakin and Padme are disguised as refugees? and are eating their meal in the hold of a ship with many other passengers. Padme leans forward to get some food, when the camera angle changes she is sitting upright in her seat against the chair back. 38. In the scene where Anakin and Padme are about to eat, Anakin uses the force to levitate her pear-like fruit to his plate. He then proceedes to cut it pretty much in half. However, the piece he sends over to her is much smaller than half - we even see the remainder of the pear on his plate which is substantially larger than it was in the shot before. 39. When Anakin is crying on Tattooine, he starts to cry and the tears are running down his face, but then they disappear and his face is completely dry, then there are more tears, and the same thing happens again. 40. As Anakin and Amidala are landing on Tattooine, the sun on the set and the sun reflection off their ship are in different directions. The double sun would not account for this, as they are not far enough apart. 41. When Anakin and Obi-Wan are going up the lift to meet Padme, the lift is on the right hand edge of the building so when they get out they can physically only turn left. however they get out, meet Jar-Jar, and turn right. 42. When Anakin is on Tatooine talking to Watto, there are two of Watto's worker-droids visible in the background between them (behind Anakin, screen left). In front of these droids is a box, presumably theirs to carry. In the very next shot, which shows Anakin leaving with Watto, the droids are still there, but the box is nowhere in sight.

      So I know that if I was in high school or maybe even in grammar school, I would be totally pissed off about this. But given the fact that now it honestly has nothing to do with me anymore, I can say that I think that this is a good idea. I can't remember what television show was on where I saw a  urlLink McDonalds  and a  urlLink Taco Bell  in the SAME high school. And I thought that bacon, egg and cheeses were bad?!? That was one of the WORST things that I could get when I was in high school (and I thought nothing can change THAT much in 5 years LOL).    urlLink US states ban junk food from schools   Story filed: 17:51 Monday 20th May 2002   US schools are banning junk food from the canteen in an attempt to tackle the rise in teenage obesity. The country's two biggest states, Texas and California, will stop selling soft drinks, sweets and chips cafeterias from the start of the next academic year. School districts in many other states have already outlawed the sale of junk food and replaced it with soy-based burgers, grilled chicken, salads and fruit juices. The number of severely obese children in the US has doubled since 1980. Some 13% of children aged 6 to 11 years and 14% of youngsters aged 12 to 19 years were overweight in 1999.

      I personally thought that this was a riot!! I agree that makeup does get people 'high'. Its the same thing with shoes.   urlLink 10 Things You Don't Know About Women    By  urlLink Sarah Silverman   May 2002, Volume 137, Issue 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sarah Silverman, a comedian and actress, stars in the new Fox sitcom Greg the Bunny.   The assignment is "Ten things men don't know about women." I am the worst person to write this. Get  urlLink Nora Ephron . Get  urlLink Mim Udovitch . But me? Look, if you want a piece on the difference between men and women, you can pick one up next to the cash register at any bookstore. (I think computers write them now.) But as I thought about it, I realized it's up to me, as a writer, to find a unique angle. Then I found it: total and complete honesty. That's right, the following are, truly, the ten things that men don't know about women.   We go to the bathroom together because we're doing coke.   We want to cuddle after sex because we're fucking freezing.   Makeup gets you high.   The "menstrual cramp" is a made-up phenomenon. Like the "Holocaust."   Not all women like crappy, sappy movies. Unfortunately, many do. Which is why they get made. So, ultimately, you can actually blame women for the perpetuation of mediocrity in film.   Vaginas have a hidden pocket for change. (Not coins, social change.)   Our eyes are up here.   We hate our thighs because, interestingly enough, they opposed our right to vote.   Women who get boob jobs "for themselves" also give blow jobs "for themselves."   The labia minora is not Hanukkah paraphernalia.

      Ok ok I know I should watch it with the 'potty mouth' thing. I wonder if  urlLink Joe Rogan  has seen this one? Actually, I can see him writing this for some reason. But this article is too funny. I wonder if I can use this as my mantra?   urlLink Why I Love Cuss Words   I try to keep it clean, but sometimes a good fuck! or shit! provides just the release I need. Say you drop something heavy on your foot. "Gosh darn it!" doesn't cut it. And why should it? Language Hitlers say anyone who swears doesn't have sufficient mastery of the language. Bullshit. Invoke Shakespeare when someone cuts you off in traffic and see how fast you get through town. Some folks can remember when they first heard the word "fuck" or "shit." I only remember being convinced that saying fuck would send me straight to hell, where you can cuss to your heart's content as demons stick red-hot pokers up your ass. At one point I was such a twisted goody-too shoes that I blackened out the single instance of the word fuck in a book of monologues by Steve Martin. I've been fucking overcompensating every since. Swearing, cussing, taking the Lord's name in vain — all have been frowned on for centuries. George Washington told his troops to refrain from "the foolish and wicked practice of profane cursing and swearing." OK, George. You get butchered by better equipped Brits and watch your fingers and toes fall off in the cold. Can you hear those poor troops mumbling after the general rode off? "Fuck you, ya wigtop, and the horse you rode in on."  As part of his research on cursing, professor Tim Jay (author of Cursing in America and What To Do When Your Kids Talk Dirty) assigned his students to count "bad" words in the movies. The findings are not surprising: Movies during the Eighties contained an average of 81 cuss words, up from 24 during the Sixties and 1.5 in films before that. Is that an indication of a decline in our society, or is Hollywood making better movies? War is not some goddamned action-adventure movie. Even in classics like Gone With the Wind, do you think Scarlett O'Hara was shaking her fist at the sky saying, "Goshdarnit, I've lost everything and might die here of starvation?" Hell no. She was spitting, "Fuck them Yankees." But nobody gave a damn. What galls me most is how hypocritical the media is when it comes to swear words. Richard Nixon swore like a bat out of hell on the Watergate tapes. But no newspaper had the guts to print the transcripts with the expletives not deleted. (Not only was Nixon an asshole, he had no talent using cuss words.) Reinhold Aman, a former university professor and editor of Maledicta Press, calls it "newspaper censorshit" so publications that quote him have to print it as "newspaper censorsh—." He wonders, as I do, why so many publications spell fuck as f—-. What is that? Find? Food? Fork? The newsweeklies will show its prissy readers graphic photos of mutilated Rwandans, but if someone says, "This is bullshit," it causes a ruckus. If you are going to disguise words that might offend some readers, what about h—-s—ual, ab—tion or s-x? Once you start looking for censorship, it pops up everywhere. Entertainment Weekly once printed an interview with Howard Stern and used dashes to disguise words like asshole and fuck. But in the same article, the magazine included a graphic description of a Stern writer sticking his finger up someone's butt. When a Republican congressman called Bill Clinton a "scumbag," the New York Times didn't print the word. Instead, they called it a "vulgarity for a condom" (?) and later "a euphemism for a despicable person." That narrows it down. More recently, the journalism review Brill's Content began censoring "naughty" words. In one issue, it quotes a court document: "Hotseattle also asked if I had seen a picture of his naked c--k." Is that how the affidavit printed the word? Probably not. So the quote isn't accurate. In past issues, this hardhitting magazine has also censored fuck and bullshit (the latter in an essay by investigative journalist Bob Woodward). I wrote editor in chief Steve Brill to ask about the policy. He told me that these words be blocked out because, "My kids read my magazine." Maybe he should call it Brill's Children's Content. My favorite example of prudery has to be when Men's Health — a magazine read entirely by people with penises — quoted Robin Williams explaining how to save a stand-up routine. If all else fails, he said, "go for the d—- joke." Can you believe that? A men's magazine afraid of the word dick. All of this is why, to get to the point, I have launched the Society to Highlight Ingrate Terms (SHIT). Just as the National Rifle Association believes that a good gun owner is an educated gun owner, SHIT reminds its members that cuss words relieve a tremendous amount of tension, but only if used with respect for their power. SHIT will educate people to use swear words properly. For instance, shit is an all-purpose word; cussers should use it when failing an exam or watching a favorite team cost you $20 by blowing a huge lead. However, if you use lose more than $20, that's a fuck. If you're dealing with the IRS, that might be a shit or a fuck, depending on who did your taxes; if you're dealing with the FBI or ATF, that's always a fuck. Among other cuss words, asshole is good for the boss or moron coworkers or in-laws, but motherfucker should be reserved for more weighty situations, such as when a mugger who shoots you even after you give him your wallet, or you realize you're slipping off the edge of the Grand Canyon as you back up for a family photo. I hear motherfucker invoked for the simplest of transgressions, such as a foul during a basketball game. No, no, no! "Fuck you" will suffice, or maybe "What the hell?" Motherfucker is a fairly serious accusation. Membership in SHIT is free, but we do expect members to uphold certain standards. Children must be encouraged to use cuss words properly, or not at all (if a toddler wants to say shit when he falls on his face, he'll say it. Give him time). We do not swear at police officers, because they have guns. And although swear words exist in all languages, SHIT uses the English standard. Members are, however, permitted to say "Pardon my French." Should you lack the control to use cuss words only when warranted, you may suspend your membership by saying aloud in front of two witnesses, "Fuck SHIT." Remember to burn your membership card.

      Killing to sell someone's body parts?!? What the hell is the matter with these people? And the fact that the man 'hacked' off the head with a 'knife'. That must have been some knife. And what do you do with a hacked off head? 'some traditional healers believe are essential ingredients for certain kinds of medicine' I want to know what kind of medicine this is so that I never have to go to that doctor.  urlLink Human Head for Sale  JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African police sting operation has bagged a murderer and the human head he was trying to sell for use in traditional medicine, police said on Thursday. Police have in the past uncovered several so-called muti murders of people killed for body parts that some traditional healers believe are essential ingredients for certain kinds of medicine. Police said the head belonged to a 52-year-old man whose headless corpse was found Monday in Krugersdorp. The head had been hacked off with a knife. "A trap was set whereby a 23-year-old man was arrested who had attempted to sell the head for 10,000 rand ($980) for muti purposes," a police statement said. The arrest was made on Wednesday in Krugersdorp, a town west of Johannesburg. The suspect will appear in court Friday to face a charge of murder. Police said they believed he had stabbed his victim several times before decapitating him.

      yesterday turned out to be one of those days that i can honestly day that i couldn't have asked for much more. i went to my mom's house and i gave her her mother's day presents. then we baked cookies and i made a flyer for bob (my stepdad). he's selling his  urlLink motorcycle . and then we went out to dinner with the family. it was so fun. and maybe that might seem strange to some, but it was actually a good time. then we all went back to mom and bob's for coffee and fresh baked chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies (so yummy). and then i watched a bunch of movies with my mom and hung out and talked about all kinds of stuff from  urlLink priest scandals  to the  urlLink israel/palestine issues  to  urlLink vietnam  and how her brother was there and a lot of other people that she knows.  so today i decided that i was going to give  urlLink flashmx  another try. since i have no 'formal' training in mx, i have been a little intimidated by the format of everything (im totally used to v.5) but for some reason today, i decided that i had to try again. and i did. and im working on a new little intro thingy for this site. so far, so good. its been all rainy here today. not that that's a bad thing...i  love  the rain. but i hate the  urlLink thunder . well, to be a little more specific, my  dog  hates the thunder. he starts freaking out and looking all around the house for places to hide. and we have no way of calming him down. he just freaks out and shakes. poor  urlLink doggie .

      I know that there is a definitate appeal to wanting to pretend that you're an astraunaut. And I understand that if you're a billionaire that $20 million would be a small dent in your pocket. And I can see how making a documentary while in space might serve some education purpose. I think that might be a documentary that I would actually watch. And I think after growing up in a generation who had grown up watching  urlLink Space Camp  we have all, at one point wished that we could go into space. And I do think that Lance is the cutest member of boy band nsync (yes I think that he is WAY cuter than Justin). And maybe $20 million might help out the space program in Russia. But I have to wonder if using the Russian Aerospace Agency so that tourists can go into outer space is the best use of our resources that we have available. It seems as though we are just promoting the idea that 'If you have enough money...you can do whatever you want.' I always had a lot of respect for astraunaughts. Not only were they a few chosen to make an incredible journey, but they were also in great physical shape and incredibly intelligent. Thay had 'earned' their trip. And not to say that these people haven't but it seems to take away from all those little kids who wanted to be so smart so that they could go to  urlLink Space Camp  (myself included). That was one (of my many) dreams as a child. I wanted to go to Space Camp in the hopes that I might someday get to be like  urlLink Sally Ride . And if we allow this trip to become a tourist event for anyone who can fork over that kind of dough, what happens to all those kids who thought you had to be smart to achieve your goals?   urlLink  *NSYNC member cleared for space trip    MOSCOW (May 31, 2002 10:49 p.m. EDT) - The world's next would-be space tourist, Lance Bass of boy band *NSYNC, said Friday that Russian space doctors have cleared him for a flight to the international space station aboard a Russian rocket, a journey he hopes to make this fall. Bass, 23, shrugged off questions about the dangers of space flight. "I like to be positive, I'm an optimist," he told reporters in Moscow. "I know physically I can do it, I know mentally I can do it." The Russian Aerospace Agency said earlier this week that it hadn't yet received commercial proposals from Bass or his representatives and warned that there is little chance he can complete training in time for the next Soyuz rocket launch in October. Bass did not comment on financial details of his bid. The world's second space tourist, South African Mark Shuttleworth, returned to Earth this month after a weeklong trip that cost him $20 million - the same sum the world's first space tourist, Dennis Tito, paid last year. Bass said Friday he still hopes to go to space in the fall. He said the October flight would ideally suit his band's busy schedule, and added that other band members were "very supportive" of his adventure. Bass said he and another would-be space tourist, former NASA official Lori Garver, spent weeks passing grueling tests to qualify for the mission, with 48 doctors certifying their fitness at Russia's premier space medicine center, the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems. Bass was found to have an irregular heartbeat, and although it was not necessarily a hindrance to a space mission, he had it corrected by a medical procedure back in the United States. Bass said he had long dreamed of going to space and hoped his mission would serve educational purposes through a documentary he would make in space. "We're doing final negotiations right now with a major network to air this," he said. "It makes me feel like a great spokesperson for these space programs." Bass said he loved Russia and was looking forward to studying Russian - a requirement for landing a seat on a Soyuz. "It's going to be very difficult but something I'm looking forward to," he said. Fort Worth, Texas-based RadioShack Corp. financed Bass' medical screening and also provided support to Garver, who hopes to make her space flight next April. "I'm more patient," Garver joked, saying she would be training alongside Bass as his backup at the Russian Star City cosmonaut training center outside Moscow while working to gather financial support for her own mission. Bass hailed Garver as a great expert and excellent companion. "She's so brilliant and so dedicated to this project ... She is like a human encyclopedia when it comes to space," he said. Both Bass and Garver are in discussions with additional sponsors and television networks to expand their financial support beyond RadioShack. Jeffrey Manber, president of the Amsterdam-based MirCorp company that is helping Bass and Garver, said he was conducting talks with Russian space officials. The Interfax news agency quoted Aerospace Agency spokesman Sergei Gorbunov as saying Bass should take "extremely energetic measures" to quickly wrap up commercial talks and start training. But Gorbunov voiced doubts the singer would manage to secure a seat on October's flight.

      i checked out the  urlLink billboard  charts this morning and saw that a song off of the last  urlLink goo goo dolls  cd was on there so i decided to check it out. omg!!! love it!! i went out last night and ran into my cousin and a few of the chicks that we hang out with at the bar. i told them all about the boy. i ended up getting free beers and shots for the rest of the night because they almost saw me cry (which is quite unusual for me). i have to say that they made me feel a billion times better.   Sympathy   Stranger than your sympathy. This is my apology. I'm killing myself from the inside out. All my fears have pushed you out. I wish for things that I don't need. All I wanted. And what I chase won't set me free. All I wanted. And I get scared but I'm not crawling on my knees. Oh yeah everything's all wrong yeah. Everything's all wrong yeah. Where the hell did I think I was. Stranger than your sympathy. I take these things so I don't feel. I'm killing myself form the inside out. Now my head's been filled with doubt. It's hard to lead the life you choose. All I wanted. When all your luck's run out on you. All I wanted. You can't see when all your dreams are coming true. Oh yeah it's easy to forget yeah. You choke on the regrets yeah. Who the hell did I think I was. Stranger than your sympathy. All these thoughts you stole form me. I'm not sure where I belong. Nowhere's home and I'm all wrong.

      i hate boys...i hate them...i hate them...i hate them...for now anyway. its times like these where there are so many songs to describe how i feel. i think that some  urlLink ani  will do just perfectly.   done wrong   the wind is ruthless. the trees shake angry fingers at the sky. the people hunch their shoulders. hold their collars over their ears and run by. it's a cold rain. it's a hard rain like the kind you find in songs. i guess that makes me the jerk with the heartache here to sing to you   about how i been done wrong. i am sitting, watching out the window of the coffee shop and i'm waiting, waiting waiting for it to let up. i am rocking like a cradle warming my hands with the cup in between. i am leaning over the table holding my face over the steam. and before it gets so cold that the rain turns to snow there's just a couple things i'd like to know. like how could you do nothing and say, i'm doing my best. how could you take almost everything and then come back for the rest. how could you beg me to stay reach out your hands and plead. and then pack up your eyes and run away as soon as i agreed. it just all slips away so slowly you don't even notice till you've lost a lot. i've been like one of those zombies in vegas pouring quarters into a slot. and now i'm tired and i am broke and i feel stupid and i feel used. and i'm at the end of my little rope and i am swinging back and forth about you. and before it gets so cold that the rain turns to snow there's just a couple things i'd like to know. like how could you do nothing and say, i'm doing my best. how could you take almost everything and then come back for the rest. how could you beg me to stay reach out your hands and plead and then pack up your eyes and run away as soon as i agreed.

      im still listening to the  urlLink evanescence  cd like crazy. i dont think that i have listened to a cd this much since the last  urlLink u2  cd came out. and my favorite song of the moment off of the cd is:   my immortal   i'm so tired of being here. suppressed by all of my childish fears. and if you have to leave i wish that you would just leave. because your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone. these wounds won't seem to heal. this pain is just too real. there's just too much that time cannot erase. when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears. when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears. and i've held your hand through all of these years. but you still have all of me. you used to captivate me by your resonating light. but now i'm bound by the life you left behind. your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. these wounds won't seem to heal. this pain is just too real. there's just too much that time cannot erase. when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears. when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears. and i've held your hand through all of these years. but you still have all of me. i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone and though you're still with me i've been alone all along.

      well both my parents and my aunts did the  urlLink ms walk  this morning. their combined totals exceeded $2,000 easily. i have to come up with some kind of thank you note for the people that donated money. i think that its the least that i can do. especially considering that my parents would have never done the walk if it wasnt for me. i guess that it was a little chilly down by the beach walking the 2.5-5 miles but there were around 1,000 people walking and that was just at the one site. its weird how things like this can make you feel a little better about humanity.

Frozen inside without your touch, without your love, darling. Only you are the life among the dead. All of this sight I can't believe I couldn't see Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me I've been sleeping a 1000 years it seems. I've got to open my eyes to everything.

      i went to go see  urlLink pirates of the carribean  last night. wow.  urlLink Johnny Depp  as Jack Sparrow was amazing - i heard him explained as a cross between  urlLink christopher lowell  and  urlLink steven tyler . the graphics were amazing - especially in the swordfight scenes toward the end.   Aboard the Black Pearl, infamous pirate Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) attacks the city of Port Royal and kidnaps a governor's daughter, Elizabeth(Keira Knightley). Barbossa then sets sail with his hostage toward a secret hideaway, hoping to lift an ancient curse by sacrificing her and returning a once-plundered treasure. Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) meets an eccentric seaman, Jack Sparrow, who reveals that the Black Pearl was formerly his ship, until Barbossa committed mutiny. Together, they assemble a ragtag crew and commandeer a British vessel, hoping to chase down and free both Elizabeth and Sparrow's Pearl. Following after them is the British military, led by Elizabeth's would-be fiancé, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) urlLink [movies.com]

      Is it really ethical for a Presidental Candidate to use Air Force One for re-election travel? Maybe if the Candidate were paying for it? Taxpayers pay for Air Force One.  urlLink News    Bush Campaigns Heavily on Air Force One  By SCOTT LINDLAW  WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush is using Air Force One for re-election travel more heavily than any predecessor, wringing maximum political mileage from a perk of office paid for by taxpayers.   While Democratic rival John Kerry digs into his campaign bank account to charter a plane to roam the country, Bush often travels at no cost to his campaign simply by declaring a trip ``official'' travel rather than ``political.''   Even when the White House deems a trip as political, the cost to Bush's campaign is minimal. In such instances, the campaign must only pay the government the equivalent of a comparable first-class fare for each political traveler on each leg, Federal Election Commission guidelines say.   Usually, that means paying a few hundred or a few thousand dollars for the president and a handful of aides. It's a minuscule sum, compared to the $56,800-per-hour the Air Force estimates it costs to run Air Force One.   It is an advantage that Bush and other presidents before him have enjoyed. President Clinton frequently was criticized by Republicans for his record-setting use of Air Force One in the campaign season, and Bush is exceeding Clinton's pace.   ``It's really something that's abused,'' said Bill Allison, managing editor of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, government watchdog group.   ``On the one hand, the president can't fly coach,'' Allison said. ``But on the other hand, taxpayers are in essence subsidizing campaign trips, something that goes against the grain of how the political system is supposed to operate.''   The White House says it is following both the law and tradition in deciding which events are official, and thus paid for by taxpayers.   ``Federal election laws set forth clear guidelines as to how costs should be incurred, and consistent with decades of past practices, we strictly adhere to those guidelines,'' said White House spokeswoman Erin Healy.   Bush has logged more than 68,000 miles this year on Air Force One, all within the continental United States except for a quick run to Mexico in January. With rare exceptions, he confines his travels to the more than a dozen states he and Kerry are fighting hardest for, and to places where he is raising campaign money.   Of those states, Bush has made five trips to Pennsylvania, four each to Missouri, Florida and Ohio, and three to Wisconsin. He also has flown to 24 fund-raisers for himself and the Republican Party.   The White House labeled travel to fund-raisers ``political.'' Likewise, it deemed as ``political'' a thank-you mixer with big donors in Georgia, his first campaign rally in Orlando, Fla., and bus tours through Michigan, Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin, meaning his campaign paid a share of the costs.   But of the more than $203 million Bush has raised for his re-election, less than 1 percent has gone to reimbursing the government for travel costs this year.   The campaign repaid White House Airlift Operations at least $512,000 from May 2003 through April 2004, including reimbursements for political travel by Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, first lady Laura Bush and political aides.   The reimbursements do not cover the cargo planes that shuttle the president's limousines and helicopters to every event, or travel expenses of White House advance workers who lay the groundwork for the trips.   It is difficult to say precisely what the Bush campaign is repaying the government per trip. The White House refuses to:   Provide lists of political aides who travel with Bush and whose travels are financed by the re-election campaign; or say how many political aides go on any given trip, or even offer a range.   Provide dollar figures on reimbursements for specific trips. Bush's re-election campaign periodically reports to the FEC lump reimbursement sums for unspecified travel.   Say how it decides which trips are official rather than political.   An Associated Press tally of Bush's travels shows he has made at least 114 trips in the 17 months since January 2003.   Clinton flew Air Force One on 123 domestic trips between January 1995 and mid-October 1996, a period of 22 months. It was a record for re-election-related travel aboard the presidential aircraft, according to the Center for Public Integrity.

      I wish that the USA would adobt these guidelines so that  urlLink Dominos  can stop making shitty pizzas.   urlLink CNN.com - Italy sets strict pizza guidelines - May 27, 2004    Italy sets strict pizza guidelines  ROME, Italy (AP) -- Pizza-makers beware: Italy has issued strict guidelines to protect the real Neapolitan pizza from bogus copies. The regulations touch on everything from size to ingredients to the type of oven -- and rule-abiding restaurants will receive a special label attesting that real pizza can be eaten there. The rules, issued by the Agriculture Ministry, are part of Italy's efforts to protect its cuisine across the European Union, although it was not immediately clear what steps would be taken for enforcement. The guidelines, eight articles printed Tuesday in the country's Official Gazette, rule that real Neapolitan pizza must be round, no more than 35 centimeters (14 inches) in diameter, no thicker than 0.3 centimeters (0.1 inches) in the middle and with a crust of about 2 centimeters (0.8 inches). "The texture must be soft, elastic, easily foldable," the guidelines say. The norms also specify what kind of flour, yeast, tomatoes and oil must be used. They recognize only three types of real Neapolitan pizza: Marinara, with garlic and oregano; Margherita, with basil and mozzarella cheese from the southern Apennines; and extra-Margherita, with fresh tomatoes, basil and buffalo mozzarella from Campania, the region that includes pizza's hometown, Naples. The dough must be rolled out manually and baked in wood-burning ovens that can reach the required temperature of 485 Celsius (905 Fahrenheit). The regulations were approved after surveying pizza-makers in Naples and surrounding areas. Restaurants that abide by the rules will get a label saying their pizza is a "guaranteed traditional specialty." "These norms protect one of the most ancient and most important gastronomic traditions," said Antonio Pace, owner of one of Naples' oldest pizza restaurants and the president of a pizza-makers' association. "We don't want the others not to make pizza, only we want them to make it as we make it -- as it should be done," he said Wednesday. The ANSA news agency estimated that of 23,000 pizza restaurants in Italy -- which make 56 million pizzas each week -- about 200 would seek the certification immediately. But Pace said he expects the vast majority of restaurants will adhere to the rules to get the label. Financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, which like many other Italian newspapers devoted a front-page story Wednesday to the pizza rules, described the move as "an act of love, but a desperate one." "Pizza is now a stateless, boundless, flag-less food," it said.

      What a cool idea! Hispanic, Women, Black and Men all have their own channels, why not the gay community!   urlLink MTV to launch new channel for gay viewers in 2005 - May. 25, 2004    MTV to launch gay network in 2005 Experts believe the new network will help advertisers target gay and lesbian consumers. May 25, 2004: 6:24 PM EDT  NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - MTV Networks said Tuesday it will launch a new cable network that carries programs primarily aimed at gay and lesbian viewers. MTV, owned by Viacom Inc. (VIA.B: Research, Estimates), said the new cable network, called LOGO, will be advertiser-supported and is scheduled to make its basic cable debut in February. Content on the new network will be comprised of about 25 percent originally developed shows, with the remainder coming from outside sources, according to Reuters. The plan to launch the gay-themed channel had been on-again, off-again in the past two years at Viacom. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman and CEO, made a rare confession, saying that his company made a mistake earlier by scrapping a plan to launch the first U.S. gay-themed network. Redstone then ordered Tom Freston, chairman and chief executive of Viacom's MTV Networks, to revive the business plan. Industry watchers said Viacom's renewed interest came amid a surge in the popularity of gay characters and gay-themed shows on television in the past few years, led by NBC's "Will & Grace" and last summer's runaway hit "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" on Bravo. Major U.S. networks have been reluctant to create a gay cable network because some executives fear that conservative viewers would be bothered by its programming. But the high amount of disposable income controlled by gay consumers has long remained an attractive target for advertisers, said Howard Buford, head of Prime Access Inc., a gay and lesbian advertising and marketing agency in New York. The combined buying power of gay and lesbian consumers averaged nearly $500 billion a year, slightly below the consuming power of blacks but higher than Hispanics, according to Prime Access. "You could reach gay audiences by going on 'Will & Grace' certainly, but it's a very expensive program, and you are reaching a lot of other consumers as well," Buford told CNN/Money. MTV's new network will be an "efficient vehicle to reach these audiences with specific selling messages," he added.

      ...An easy game to play...Damn it!! Enough cheesy love songs. I had a  urlLink softball  game and we won! Yeah! I think that the final score was 13 to 3. I scored none of the runs (thank you very much). and I got on base none of the times (oh you're too kind). But I did get a foul tip hit to me and I did catch it (how you like me now). and one of the hits that I had was a nice hit. It just happened to be hit right at the third baseman. Immediately following the game, I went up to my friend Mike's new condo that he just bought (the closing was on Wednesday). I had a six pack of  urlLink Twisted Tea® Half & Half  and I got him a 12 pack of  urlLink Bud Light . I thought that was pretty nice of me considering that I was going to his house to do work. Wait...shouldn't he have bought the drinks? Anyway, we patched up holes in the walls and I took all the old  urlLink contact paper  off of the shelves. It was pretty gross. We laid out all the drop cloths so that we can paint. We got all set up for today. Now we just have to sand down the walls a little where we patched the holes and then we can start painting. I'm kinda pissed though. Mike has a roommate that didn't even bother to show up last night to help out. I mean, I understand that it isn't his condo and he is just paying rent but that is still his friend and shouldn't he have shown up at least for like an hour to help out? After I left Mike's last night I met up with some of the guys from my softball team at a bar that is at the end of my street. LOVE THAT! And as usual, out left fielder Adam was there doing  urlLink Jaeger Bombs ! So I did one. And then I ran around the bar naked and hollering! Yeah right. But according to the bartender, we go through an average of a case and a half of  urlLink Red Bull  on Friday nights after our games. He was kinda complaining about it too! What the hell? I understand that they are a pain in the ass to make but at $6- a pop, who cares? And it's not like we order one or two at a time! There's usually at least 7 or 8 of us doing them. So we told him that he should know from now on that that's where we are going to be on Friday nights after our games and drinking in the parking lot.

This is supposed to be the time when I'm starting a  urlLink career  and getting things together, getting my own place (well I had that already but had to give it up) again and starting to do things for myself. It pisses me off that I can't go to work every day. I want to. I really do. I am mentally more than capable of it. But my body will psychically not allow me to do it. I want a new body. Or maybe just a part time job.

      I will be so happy when all this low-carb bullshite is over. I am so tired of listening to people watch their carbs. Want to lose weight? Cut back on the eating and exercise. Its been proven to work time and time again. Nothing is a quick fix. What happens when you go on a low carb diet and lose weight and then start eating carbs again? Oh thats right! You gain weight back and then you have to start at the beginning again. Why dont people understand that? Yes all these diets can work to lose  urlLink weight  but  urlLink you  have  urlLink to  read  urlLink the  fine  urlLink print !    Beyond setting yourself up for rebound pounds, there are health concerns associated with making a protein shift. Having to break down the excess protein puts an extra burden on your liver and kidneys and, epidemiological studies suggest, may cause calcium loss (it's swept out through the urine), putting you at greater risk for osteoporosis. Moreover, a new study from the Harvard School of Public Health bolsters the view of many scientists that high-protein diets contribute to the development of cancer, particularly of the colon.   Why Are Low-Carbohydrate Diets Popular? Because we Americans just don’t know moderation and portion control. Weight control is still clearly based on the fact that you need to exercise more and consume fewer calories to lose weight. Diet plans that let us eat all we want of certain foods are very appealing....Contrary to popular opinion, carbohydrates are necessary to our health because these foods provide energy, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other phytochemicals. It’s the types of carbohydrates that are overused -- sweet drinks, desserts, candy, larger portions of bread, pasta and refined starches -- that get us into calorie trouble. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and dairy products are high-carbohydrate foods that are essential to our good health. Whole grains such as breads and cereals are high in fiber. Fiber helps lower blood cholesterol. Fiber helps us feel full longer so we don’t crave junk foods between meals. Fruits and vegetables, also carbohydrate sources, contain fiber and phytochemicals, which may help fight off heart disease and cancer....Healthy weight loss must begin with a plan that can be continued and adapted to a weight-maintenance program for life. Gradual lifestyle changes lead to permanent weight loss and good health. Losing weight quickly and gaining it back puts you at greater risk of being overweight. Popping “diet pills” doesn’t change your behavior. Get off the roller coaster and take control of your eating for a leaner body and better health. Moderation, portion control and exercise are messages that don’t make headlines or sell diet books, but they really work.   "We're not recommending this diet to anyone," Green says. "We don't know what would happen if you followed it for years. What we found is it seems to work for short-term weight loss."   Many Americans are losing weight on so-called ³fad² diets ­ but in the process, they could be putting themselves at greater risk for developing coronary heart disease, according to a University of Kentucky College of Medicine study published in the October issue of the Journal of the American College of Nutrition.   The cornerstone of the Atkins philosophy is a four-phase eating plan in conjunction with vitamin and mineral supplementation and regular exercise.    urlLink Home & Real Estate: "Dirty Little Secret About Low-Carb Diets"   Almost half of low-carbohydrate dieters believe cutting carbohydrates from their meals is such a magic bullet for weight loss that there is no reason to count calories too, according to a new survey of 1,000 adults and 200 primary care physicians that was conducted by RoperASW for Slim-Fast Foods Co. The steak and bacon crowd are in 'calorie denial.' And doctors say that attitude doesn't bode well for long-term weight loss success. Calories still count. 'Americans are under tremendous pressure to lose weight,' Dr. John Foreyt, a clinical psychologist and director of the Behavioral Medicine Research Center at Baylor College, said in a news release announcing the survey results. 'As a result, people are willing to believe what defies science--the notion that cutting carbs without cutting calories will generate lasting weight loss. The reality is, it is still important to control calories when following a low-carb diet or any other type of diet.' The survey findings: Do calories matter when you are going low-carb? 46 percent of low-carb dieters say they can lose weight by just cutting out the carbs without cutting calories. Fully 86 percent of doctors disagree. Can you lose weight and keep it off without cutting calories? 52 percent say they can lose weight without cutting calories as long as they restrict carbohydrates. The vast majority of doctors (76 percent) say a diet will only be successful over the long haul if calories are cut, too. Does portion control matter when you are going low-carb? 34 percent say there is no need to control portion size, while 83 percent of doctors say it is extremely or very important to do so. Sixty-one percent of doctors are concerned that their patients following a low-carb diet are not controlling their portion sizes as well. Should people following a low-carb diet worry about getting all the essential nutrients their body needs? 55 percent say there is no worry about getting all the essential nutrients just because carbohydrates are reduced, compared with 95 percent of doctors who note how important it is to get essential nutrients when following this kind of restricted diet. Perhaps the best advice, no matter what type of diet you're on, is to eat smart. Eat only when you're hungry and don't overeat.

       urlLink     urlLink Which Historical Lunatic Are  You ?    urlLink From the fecund loins of Rum and Monkey.    You are Charles VI of France, also known as Charles the Mad or Charles the Well-Beloved!   A fine, amiable and dreamy young man, skilled in horsemanship and archery, you were also from a long line of dribbling madmen. King at 12 and quickly married to your sweetheart, Bavarian Princess Isabeau, you enjoyed many happy months together before either of you could speak anything of the other's language. However, after illness you became a tad unstable. When a raving lunatic ran up to your entourage spouting an incoherent prophecy of doom, you were unsettled enough to slaughter four of your best men when a page dropped a lance. Your hair and nails fell out. At a royal masquerade, you and your courtiers dressed as wild men, ending in tragedy when four of them accidentally caught fire and burned to death. You were saved by the timely intervention of the Duchess of Berry's underskirts. This brought on another bout of sickness, which surgeons countered by drilling holes in your skull. The following months saw you suffer an exorcism, beg your friends to kill you, go into hyperactive fits of gaiety, run through your rooms to the point of exhaustion, hide from imaginary assassins, claim your name was Georges, deny that you were King and fail to recognise your family. You smashed furniture and wet yourself at regular intervals. Passing briefly into erratic genius, you believed yourself to be made of glass and demanded iron rods in your attire to prevent you breaking. In 1405 you stopped bathing, shaving or changing your clothes. This went on until several men were hired to blacken their faces, hide, jump out and shout "boo!", upon which you resumed basic hygiene. Despite this, your wife continued sleeping with you until 1407, when she hired a young beauty, Odette de Champdivers, to take her place. Isabeau then consoled herself, as it were, with your brother. Her lovers followed thick and fast while you became a pawn of your court, until you had her latest beau strangled and drowned. A severe fever was fended off with oranges and pomegranates in vast quantities, but you succumbed again in 1422 and died. Your disease was most likely hereditary. Unfortunately, you had anywhere up to eleven children, who variously went on to develop capriciousness, great cruelty, insecurity, paranoia, revulsion towards food and, in one case, a phobia of bridges.

      This is by far one of the funniest things that I have ever read...   urlLink eBay item 4146756343 (Ends Apr-28-04 15:37:01 PDT) - SIZE 12 WEDDING DRESS/GOWN NO RESERVE    For Sale: One Slightly Used Size 12 Wedding Gown. Only worn twice: Once at the wedding and once for these pictures. Make: Victoria Style: 611 Size: 12 Divorce forces sale  I found my ex-wife's wedding dress in the attic when I moved.  She took the $4000 engagement ring but left the dress.  I was actually going to have a dress burning party when the divorce became final, but my sister talked me out of it.  She said, "That’s such a gorgeous dress.  Some lucky girl would be glad to have it. You should sell it on EBay. At least get something back for it."  So, this is what I’m doing.  I’m selling it hoping to get enough money for maybe a couple of Mariners tickets and some beer.  This dress cost me $1200 that my drunken sot of an ex-father-in-law swore up and down he would pay for but didn’t so I got stuck with the bill.  Luckily I only got stuck with his daughter for 5 years. Thank the Lord we didn't have kids. If they would have turned out like her or her family I would have slit my wrists. Anyway, it’s a really nice dress as you can see in the pictures.  Personally, I think it looks like a $1200 shower curtain, but what do I know about this.  We tried taking pictures of this lovely white garment but it didn’t look right on the hanger as you can see, so my sister says, "You need a model."  Well, quite frankly my sister isn’t exactly small, (like a size 12 is?) so she wouldn’t pose for the picture. Seeing as I have sworn off women for the time being and I ain’t friends with any, it left me holding the bag.  I took the liberty of blacking out my face - not to protect the ex-wife but to protect me from my bar buddies and co-workers finding out about it.  I would never live it down.  Actually I didn’t think my head would fit in the neck hole, but then I figured she got her Texas cheerleader hair through there I could get my head in it.  Though, after looking at the pictures, I thought it made me look fat.  How do you women wear this crap? I only had to walk 3 feet and I tripped twice. Don’t worry ladies - I am wearing clothes on underneath it.  I gotta say it did make me feel very pretty.  So if it can make me feel pretty, it can make you feel pretty, especially on the most important day of your life, right?  Anyway, I was told to say it has a train and a veil and all kinds of shiny beady things.  I think it's funny that one picture makes it look like the chest plate off an Imperial Storm Trooper.  Did I mention that all I want is a ball game and beer?  Cheap at twice the price.  Ladies, you won’t regret this.  You may regret the dude you marry but not the dress.  Just a little side note - As I was putting this ad in EBay, it asked me for a color.  Is a wedding dress any other freaking color than white or ivory??!!  If it is it wouldn't be a wedding dress, now would it??  I suppose black would work...

      I'm sure that by now just about everyone who watches tv at all has seen the Six Flags commercial with the dancing man. I originally wanted to know who was doing this dance so I did some searching and ended up with far more information that I had planned.   When I looked for who the dancing man was I found someone had already asked  urlLink Google .  Question Who is the old guy dancing in the Six Flags commercials? Answer There is no answer at this time.  from  urlLink The Times-Picayune  The wildly popular commercial for Six Flags theme parks is the subject of oodles of blogs and message boards on the Internet. Most bloggers seem obsessed with identifying the "little old guy" who dances but some just can't get the song out their heads. Only the chorus music from the 1998 Vengaboys dance hit "We Like to Party (The Venga Bus)" is used, but it's enough to pique the curiosity of plenty of viewers. The Vengaboys are an otherwise forgettable Latin band. As for the "little old guy" dancing in the commercials, Six Flags offices all over the country have been flooded with calls from people wanting to know more about him. But theme park officials will say only that he's their "ambassador of fun" and won't reveal his identity or anything else about him (or her). The spot is Six Flags' first nationwide ad campaign in seven years and it's a huge success. In fact, the psychedelic bus featured in the ads is making the rounds to Six Flags theme parks and it will be at the New Orleans park sometime in June.  This is what I found people were saying and talking about in regards to the ad.  From  urlLink Pinwheel  at  urlLink RateItAll   The Old guys is frightening. I lie awake at night fearful that if I fall asleep he'll creep up the stairs, sneak into my bedroom, and bludgeon me with a hammer until I'm dead. My last vision would be that of this terrifying ghoul laughing as he continuously strikes me about the head and body. I imagine as the last breath excaped my lungs, he would drop his pants and urinate on my lifeless body then dance his way down the stairs to continue his rampage on the rest of my family. He would beat my father until he was paralyzed and force him to watch as he beat my mother and abused her corpse. If six flags is willing to instill such fear into minds of television viewers, I couldn't imagine the horror that must exist at their parks.   From  urlLink grmarq88  at  urlLink RateItAll   What an advertising coup! I love this guy! My teenagers do not understand why I am so obsessed with him. I am frustrated that GMA didn't reveal who it was. I woke all the kids up to watch; they went back to sleep. My daughter told me it was Paris Hilton. I'm going with the Steve Urkel kid.

       urlLink     urlLink Which Genocidal Maniac Are You?    urlLink Brought to you by Rum and Monkey   A solemn 'shalom' to you You're Ariel Sharon! You're the current Prime Minister of Israel, responsible for the killings of numerous Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli army and police forces, not to mention the illegal destruction of Yassir Arafat's HQ. But check this! You were also the Minister of Defence in 1982, when Israeli forces brutally massacred Palestinians in two refugee camps on the outskirts of Beirut non-stop for over thirty hours. Regarding your current actions against the Palestinian people, you recently said: 'In wartime, you don't have to expose everything to the world, to stand in public and reveal everything, in the name of that hypocritical and lie-filled concept known as honesty.' In other words, you're not going to say what you're doing, and you might even lie about it. Spoken like a true genocidal maniac. [People criticising Sharon and the Israeli regime are often accused of being anti-semitic. As intelligent people will know, a comment on a country is not the same as a comment on a race of people or a religion. Our criticism is purely political, and this test was written by someone with a Jewish background. We hate racism, and we thank you for not falsely accusing us of it.]

The only trouble - the only hole in your veneer of digital perfection - is the way you laugh at everyone. If someone doesn't know UNIX, you laugh at them. If they lose their password, they laugh at them. If they visit a website using Microsoft Internet Explorer and their computer succumbs to an Internet worm, you laugh. Then you take a swig of your Coke, and with another hearty chuckle tell all your friends on IRC about the idiots you have to deal with. Maybe it makes you feel better about yourself, although let's face it, you don't need help in that department. You're great, you. Fantastic like burning cool. If only those luddite office fools would let you play Unreal Tournament in peace.

      I had a text messaging conversation with a guy that I met recently. Originally, him and I were heading down a path of friendship and brother/sisterish kind of antics. Somehow, our path shifted into innocent flirting and tons of sexual tension. He has a girlfriend (GF to protect the innocent and my ass) and I have a boyfriend (BF to save my ass again). I was accused of hooking up with 'a' by my BF but it never happened. Is it okay to continue a friendship with 'a' considering that we have semi-feelings for each other? What if we agree not to act on them? Is that just asking for trouble? Does feelings for someone else mean that I do not have strong enough feelings for my BF or is this just normal?  urlLink Do friendships with the opposite sex count as cheating?  According to  urlLink Why You Don’t Have to Have Sex to Cheat    How Do You Know If You’re Being Unfaithful? Consider your own personal relationships:   When you hear a funny joke or good piece of gossip, do you first tell other colleagues? By the time you get home, have you chewed it all over so much at the office that you don’t feel like telling that joke again to your spouse?   Do you discuss all of your work problems (or issues involving volunteer work or other important things you are involved in) so thoroughly with colleagues that you’re all talked out by the time you return home? Do you feel like it would take too long to review and explain the entire issue from scratch to your spouse?   Do you go out alone to lunch or after work for drinks with members of the opposite sex?   Do you enjoy harmless (by your definition) flirtation with someone of the opposite sex at a cocktail party?   Do you believe that getting emotionally excited by flirting with someone of the opposite sex is helpful to your marriage? Do you think it helps educate you as to what you need more of from your spouse? Do you tell yourself that the juice you get from flirting brings more vitality to your marriage?   Do you spend as long buying the “right gift” for a colleague of the opposite sex as you do for your own spouse?   Do you ride in a car sharing pleasant, personal conversation alone with a member of the opposite sex on the way to meetings or other work-related events?   Do you share intimate issues about yourself or marriage with a member of the opposite sex?   If you’re doing any of these things, you’re being emotionally unfaithful to your spouse. You have only so much energy. If you’re spending it with coworkers or outside the home and then getting home and feeling too tired to spend any more on your spouse, that’s emotional infidelity. You’re effectively relocating vital marital energy into the hands of others. Forget about where it might end up. Even if you never touch this other person, you have still used that person to relate to, and in doing so, you relate away from your spouse.    a: you awake? me: yup a: you want to go see the YANKS tomorrow? im blowing off work. at the DINER right now. me: i got no loot a: my battery is about to die a: got enought to drive down and back? want to get out of there? need company? a: wake up kid a: if you didnt want to go all you had to do was say so, not make up some story. me: i was not making up a story and i do want to go but i have no money and i told BF i would help him. a: dont bullshit a bullshitter. you were scrambling to find an excuse not to go because youre scared. of what? me: thats not it at all. im sorry that i think slow sometimes. a: im sorry i may jump the gun sometimes. i like spending time w/you, and my intentions arent always innocent. me: its ok i understand. i like spending time eith u too. what do u mean your intentions are not always innocent? a: like sometimes i care about you and think about you more than i let on me: thats sweet i care about u too me: whats the matter with that? a: i just am not always doing it to be friendly...are you catching my drift? ;-> me: that u want to do the things i was accused of doing with u? a: im not going to deny that i think about it. especially how well we get along me: if it makes u feel any better i thought about it. a: its not like im desperate here and i need pity. im being sincere when i say that i really enjoy spending time with you. me: i dont remember pitying you or calling u desperate. i was being sincere. a: maybe it was just me misinterpreting. i sorry. the more time i spend with you, the more i want to spend with you me: i feel the same way a: so heres the million dollar question...WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT? me: honestly, i have no clue a: me either. all i know is that i like you, and i like being around you me: me too a: how serious are you with BF? me: how serious are you with GF? a: good question. i dont know anymore. the fact that i have feelings for you has to count for something me: same thing here a: what should we do? me: probably nothing right now a: little tough isnt it?

      ikea  urlLink opened  in  urlLink New Haven  today. It was so crazy! People were standing in the rain for hours to get a free chair that was worth $99. People will do anything for free. Not me though. Well, that's not all true. My mother and I had talked about going early this morning (around 6am) but after we had both seen the chair, we decided against it. And its a good thing that we didn't. The 199th woman to get the chair was there last night at 8pm. Apparently, hundreds of people stood in the rain last night to be one of the first to get in the store. It was the  urlLink 200th  store for ikea worldwide and is the  urlLink first  in New England. And because they did, I decided to take  urlLink the IKEA Family Personality Test      You are a typical GRUNDTAL dish drainer!   GRUNDTAL dish drainers are reliable, meticulous, highly organised and well balanced. They are sensitive to sudden changes and major upheavals. GRUNDTAL dish drainers tend to remain loyal to the same car brand, often a Saab, all their lives. Many also collect things like china, glass and silverware. Dish drainers tend to have special hobbies, and whether it's aerobics or sailing, they always insist on having the best equipment available. Top performance is crucial and while not exactly gadget freaks; they do go for the best quality at the lowest price. When they get what they want, these purchases can give them a real kick that may last for days.  Many dish drainers are very health-conscious and therefore live to grand old ages. They enjoy regular training and never cut corners when it comes to diet, sleep or hygiene. They are partial to traditions and will willingly dress up as Father Christmas, dance round the maypole or take part in Lucia celebrations. Some might go so far as to call the GRUNDTAL dish drainer an over-ambitious perfectionist.   Career  GRUNDTAL dish drainers rarely put their careers first, although they often make popular employees (especially with their bosses). But if they are able to combine their jobs with their special interests, their careers can really take off. When this does happen, it is generally the result of luck rather than premeditation. Dish drainers are not generally calculating by nature. Likely professions: police officers, researchers, craftsmen and engineers.   Relationships  GRUNDTAL children are paragons of virtue - clean and wholesome, verging on the priggish. GRUNDTAL dish drainers are highly compatible with RISKA mirrors and BILLY bookshelves. Should GRUNDTAL encounter a PÖSIG cushion, however, he/she may well experience dizzy spells and wonder what went wrong with the cushion's childhood.  GRUNDTAL make excellent friends and colleagues. They are highly dependable, but they may sometimes get on other people's nerves. GRUNDTAL dish drainers are also efficient and meticulous, qualities that colleagues and friends value highly. At work, the BILLY bookshelf and GRUNDTAL make a great team, and their ability to co-operate often leads to success.

      New York Yankees : Game Wrapup   I find it really screwed up that just because ESPN takes the rights to a baseball game and decides to make it the 'Game of the Week' that it means that they get to reschedule the starting time. Let me explain... The Yanks were supposed to be playing the  urlLink BoSox  at 2:05 PM yesterday.  urlLink ESPN  decided at some point that they were going to make it the 'Game of the Week'. Game time is now pushed back to 8:00 PM. Now, I am not saying that it wasn't a good decision to have the game in Prime Time. What I am saying is why is that fair to the players, fans and ticketholders of this game? Baseball players are just that, they play for a living. But, what about the rest of the world? Don't people have to work on Monday mornings? It's not like we're talking about a quick game. I was up until 12:30 AM watching it. It's a good thing that I didn't have to wake up early this morning to go to work. And what about the fans! Certainly, Senator John Kerry didn't have to worry about the traffic after getting out of Fenway but what about Joe Average who had to sit and wait in traffic for two hours. Who gives ESPN the right to change someone's entire day.

      According to the  urlLink weather channel , we are supposed to have isolated t-storms starting around 7PM. I have a softball game that starts at 6:30PM. My knees are killing me and it's like 90 degrees outside and I really do not want to play today. Maybe I should go outside and start doing a t-storm dance.

       urlLink ozzfest  kicked off the  urlLink 2004  tour in hartford, ct on saturday, july 10. and hell yes i was there. it started at 9:30am on the second stage of the meadows with  urlLink Throwdown ,  urlLink Magna-Fi ,  urlLink DevilDriver ,  urlLink Unearth ,  urlLink Every Time I Die ,  urlLink Lacuna Coi ,  urlLink Otep ,  urlLink Bleeding Through ,  urlLink Atreyu ,  urlLink Lamb of God ,  urlLink Hatebreed  and  urlLink Slipknot . the mainstage started around 5pm with  urlLink Superjoint Ritual ,  urlLink Black Label Society ,  urlLink Dimmu Borgir ,  urlLink Slayer ,  urlLink Judas Priest  and Black Sabbath. I went with Allison and Michael and met so many people there (some were really cool and some just sucked). The three of us had a great time together though. And it was in spite of the fact that it was hot and we were all dehydrated and hungry and poor from spending all our money on beer and tickets. Somehow we managed though. We skipped over the part where you pay $4.00 per 8 ounce bottle of water by filling up our left over beer cups with water and then begging the vendors to let us have a few pieces of ice. I thought that it worked pretty well.

      I used to say the first one over and over and over again!    urlLink Movies   Top 12 Best Movie Lines Ever  Horror writer Stephen King, who moonlights as an Entertainment Weekly columnist, recently polled EW readers to find out what they think are the best movie lines ever.   Here are the 12 picks by Entertainment Weekly readers:  1. "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." --Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) in "The Princess Bride"  2. "Inconceivable!" "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." --Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) in "The Princess Bride"  3. "Have fun storming the castle." --Miracle Max (Bill Crystal) in "The Princess Bride"  4. "As you wish." --Westley (Cary Elwes) in "The Princess Bride"  5. "I'll have what she's having." --Female diner (Estelle Reiner) in "When Harry Met Sally"  6. "You had me at hello." --Dorothy Boyd (Reneé Zellweger) in "Jerry Maguire"  7. "Fasten your seat belts--It's going to be a bumpy night." --Margo Channing (Bette Davis) in "All About Eve"  8. "You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together...and blow." --Marie Browning (Lauren Bacall) in "To Have and Have Not"  9. "If I'd been a ranch, they would've named me Bar Nothin'." --Gilda (Rita Hayworth) in "Gilda"  10. "Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea: They eat their young." --Ida Corwin (Eve Arden) in "Mildred Pierce"  11. "You're not too smart, are you? I like that in a man. --Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner) in "Body Heat"  12. "Get outta here! And don't come back for five to seven days!" --Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) in "My Girl"  Entertainment Weekly editors didn't want the readers to have all the fun. So they picked 50 more great movie quotes from the last half century. Here are the top five:  1. "I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it." --Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) in "On the Waterfront"  2. "We all go a little mad sometimes." --Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) in "Psycho"  3. "Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me." --Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) in "The Graduate"  4. "Hey, don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love." --Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) in "Annie Hall"  5. "She's my daughter! She's my sister! She's my daughter! My sister, my daughter. She's my sister and my daughter." --Evelyn Cross Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) in "Chinatown"
