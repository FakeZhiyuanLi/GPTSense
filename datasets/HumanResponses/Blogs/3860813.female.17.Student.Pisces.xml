        The Monday McDo Crew -- like Jaymee, it is the BEST thing that has happened to me in college. Why? Because you guys (you know who you are!) are the only people I can talk to, and I mean  really  talk to. I can be myself around you, and you wouldn't care how cheesy or weird I am. And because of that -- I LOVE YOU GUYS!! :)

         i always believed that things happen for a reason... m just not certain what exactly the reason is.. mondaymcdo is the nicest experience that has happened to me in my freshman year.. to be able to hang out wth people with the sam interests and almost the same personalities is a really big highlight in my life.. i nvr thought i would be able to gain friends as cool and sweet as jaymee and karla... hvng them in my life means understanding my life better... if there's one thing that i would never forget, that would be having two of the nicest people in the world (or in my planet) who understand how  you feel and will always be ready to hold my hand when i need it(i'll hold their hands whenever i wnt, though...)   you guys are angels.. and i'm lucky to be your friend... i love u!!

         Hahaha. I bought the Eraserhead's greatest hits,  Anthology , with my own money today. (I never buy stuff for myself, just so you know.) I've been meaning to buy it since last month, but I never had the time to buy it until now. The two CD's are supposed to be an early birthday gift for me from me. Wheee. I love it I love it I love it but not as much as I love you guys. Hehe. Wala lang.  Enough with the mushy posts! :D Tomorrow is MONDAY. (Oh that's new. Haha.)  YAY .  Oh, Ateneo beat FEU today. 67-64. Hahaha. Let's hope this winning streak lasts until the end of the season.

        hmm.. i think in this blog i'd be really really mushy.. hehe.. whoever's reading this is bound to know how serious i really am about life.. which isn't really obvious(unless you have a heart-to-heart talk with me...)      what's with the title, you might ask... hmmm... nothing... i'll explain.. but i wouldnt give out too much details.. hehe.. like what i said in my blog(ink patrol), some things are better left unsaid...       now.. here it goes... i'm hurt... wanna know why? you know the feeling when you have a really really close friend (and you consider her/him your bst friend) but you know that she doesn't exactly feel the same way about you? that's exactly what i'm feeling... hehe... and yeah.. it hurts.. if you want details.. as in the whole story... you might wnt to ask me.. but it depends kung magtitiwala ako sayo.. enough to tell you the whole thing.. for now.. the whole story's trapped inside of me... i locked it in.. i dnt have plans of letting out... not now..       why am i happy? because i have friends whom i could tell my "issues" to.. i dnt have to tell them everything.. but they know how i feel.. that's what makes everything ok.. not completely.. but they know how to cheer me up.. thank GOD for giving me great friends...       too much cheesiness in one post.. aargh.. hehe... i'll only be really mushy if i feel like so... haha.. for now.. i'm signing off...

          Hey guys.. Haha.. Well it's 11:11 PM right now, and I just finished my lovely *cough* feature article. I didn't do my best in writing it though.. Turns out it's just supposed to be a first draft. Haha. So I abused that and made my first draft really sucky. Yay. :D  So how is everybody? We weren't able to meet this Monday. So I'm expecting our next meeting to be MORE fun-packed than usual, hehe. Oh, and I'm going to be treating you guys to sundaes on the Monday after my birthday! YAY! Isn't that fun? Haha. Sorry, that's the only thing I can afford at the moment. I'm just a poor girl. :( Pulubi ng Ateneo, hehe joke. :D Pero seriously, money is very hard to come by these days.  Rogee and I went to UST today with our buds, Kiko and Rocky. Rogee, I'm really sorry about the crappy service. You know, if you guys hadn't pulled me back when I was ranting at the window today, I would have asked the guy what the absent employee's name was and march up to the Rector and have that guy fired. I mean, he's been absent for what, TWO DAYS? Poor MedTech and Education students. Tsk tsk.  What else should I type.. Oh. I saw DA LAB OF MY LAYP (eww.) in UST today. Felt sad when I saw him. :( In fact, I was even able to write a short letter to him which will always remain unsent. If you want to read it and laugh at my mushiness, it's here --  urlLink click .  Oh. This is getting to be really long. Sigh. Oh wellers. Good night guys. See you on Monday.  HUGS! :D   edit  I just realized.. I am not king anymore. :( I gave Eumir my title because the kingship was too much of a hassle. So from now on it's Queen Karla. :D :D :D queens are waaaaay more powerful than kings anyway. (Think chess.) Bwahahahaha. But that doesn't mean Queen = King's wife. NONONONONO. NOT EQUAL! NULL SET! Hahaha. =D

        not rili a good day for me today.. i have a cold... and i really don't feel good... hehe.. i went to ust a while ago(i had some requirements to take care of...) only to find out that the papers haven't been processed yet... "balik ka sa monday!"     to think that i came all the way from ateneo(tas pumunta akong ust).. oh man.. that's harsh.. it wouldn't be a bad thing if something productive happened.. but no.. good thing God's there.. i got back  to ateneo safe..(but still feeling super groggy)..    i sure hope i'd enjoy the general assembly later this evening.. pambawi sa masamang umpisa ng araw ko.. anyway.. THANKS TO GOD FOR TAKING CARE OF ME(and thanks to my friend who accompanied me... and who's as pissed off as I am..) oh well..    ei karla.. sorry about the hassle.. i'l make it up to you... mwah!

        hmm... i've been acting a little weird today.. m just not sure why.. hehe.. i know i'm naturally weird but... today.. i'm weirder than usual.. haha.. i said a lot of stupid things today.. stupid things, which, i dnt understand.. and i dnt think i'll ever understand what i meant with those things.. nyahaha..     "umiiyak ako nung pinanganak ako..." haha.. i said that earlier this morning.. but to clarify things... what i really wanted to say was "kumakanta ako nung pinanganak ako.." (i was trying to explain why i'm always singing.. but that didn't help.. i just thought it'd sound funny if i say it.. haaaay.. oh well.. another one-liner down the drain...)    "lahat ng solusyon may problema"  haha.. i think that's true but that wasn't what i was trying to say.. malapit nang lumabas yung cheesy side ko nun.. but the clown in me interfered.. hehe.. sasabihin ko dapat "lahat ng problema may solusyon".. oh well.. still made my friend laugh without meaning to...     oh well.. i think my  brain's not functioning well right now.. i hope i didn't say anything stupid in this post.. nyahaha...    speaking of weird.. check this site out:  urlLink www.theweirdsite.com

        "what i have to tell you is not easy to understand, impossible to accept. but if you will listen to our story--if you are willing to trust me--then maybe in the end you'll believe me. and it's very important that you in particular, should believe me. for, without knowing, you are the only person in the world i can share our secret with.."    la lang.. this is the nicest line in "If Only it Were True"...

      hmm.. i'm not sure what to say.. i just got back to school from mcdo.. i felt rili strange when i was there.. i guess i'm just a little confused about stuff.. hehe.  i suddenly remembered the things i try to follow everyday... eto...    1. Love without expecting to be loved back... (goes the same with hugs..)  2. Some things are better left unsaid...  3. Some questions are better left unanswered...  4. Don't be selfish.. (dnt be selfless too)  5. Think before you act   6. Trust yourself...  7. Knw what you want (and find a way to get it)  8. TRUST GOD...  9. never ever underestimate the power of doing simple things...    i've been able to live with half of these things.. but i just realized... mabubuhay na ako ng matagal even if i follow only one rule.. that is: TRUST IN GOD...   if you believe in Him... and if you trust Him.. everything would fall into place..     >GOD IS GOOD......ALWAYS...

       hmm.. it's been a long time since i last posted.. (haha.. and this is only the third time im going to post..) i promise.. this would be a little longer than my other posts... hehe..   last friday.. my friend jaymee and i got stranded in school.. if you're wondering how that happened.. the angels were crying at that time and practically flooded EDSA walk.. haha.. we were hanging out at edsa walk.. we were listening to jaymee's cd(it has nice songs in it.. nyahaha..) and then we realized that it was already flooded.. so we decided to evacuate.. haha... we continued sound trippin' at the kostka benches.. hehe.. and like any normal teenager.. we eventually got bored(rili bored).. hehe.. so jaymee dared me to wave/smile at people.. and since i was rili bored.. i dared her back.. (pretty smart of me huh?! nyahaha) anyways.. kumaway at ngumiti kami... pero some people didn't notice us.. and one girl paid too much attention to us.. hehe.. she asked us if we were from Gabay(it's an org..and we are not from that org..).. so we came up with plan B.. what's plan b? wla.. hehe.. de kidding lang.. we made a sign that says "SMILE".. it's cute, mind you.. nyahaha.. so.. while listening to jaymee's CD's.. we held the sign up.. para makita ng mga dumadaan.. other people smiled.. others.. didn't.. others tried not to..(they were trying too hard!!! they looked so cute! esp. the guy eating a lolly.. i saw you smiling!!) when asked y we were doing it.. we just said "we want to make other people happy!" and honestly, it felt rili nice seeing other people smile..     we started a smile crusade and i rili think it's nice if you start your own.. make other people smile.. samahan nyo pa ng hug wars.. hehe..   a smile starts within a person's heart..it comes from true happiness... sa mga ayw ngumiti.. if it makes you feel better... we will all find a reason to be happy.. and i'm sure that it would bring a smile to our faces..   it's a nice feeling... promise.. so just SMILE!!!    >rOgEe

         i walked in total darkness... i had no where to go and no one to talk to... i felt so lost.. i felt so empty... all my life... i've been alone...  i looked around hoping to find someone... i lost all hope knowing that there's no one... no one to help me... no one who will stay with me...  i sat and stared at the sky... no stars were there to shine... there's no moon that could light up the night...  i tried to keep myself awake... fearing that i might fall into a deep slumber... i closed my eyes... and tried to open them again... it was to late... the darkness was eating me up.... feeding on my very soul...  here i am now... seeing the face that once was my mine... remembering the road that i used to walk on... looking up at the starry sky that i failed to see... remembering the lonely girl that once was me...

         thinking of what to do with my time... thinking of what to say... could it be possible that i'm losing my mind? or is my sanity just being sucked out of me day after day?  i try to see what's right... i try to see what's wrong... but my mind just goes empty... i've been like this for so long...  i have so many questions... i don't think these make sense... am i losing my sanity... or am i naturally bent?

         yeah.. i know that i said that this would be a bad day... well... it didn't exactly turn out the way i expected it to.. and honestly speaking.. i'm happy about this day... and i take back everything(well.. not exactly everything... some things maybe..)i said in my previous post...  i just realized that i have every right to be happy... and that i dnt have a lot of reasons not to be.. so i guess i might as well be happy... i'm not alone... i have friends whom i could share my burdens with.. that's most probably because they're carrying the same burden themselves... and who else could help you out through your predicaments but others who are experiencing the same thing that you're in...  the LSGO Workshop helped me a lot... i feel a lot better about myself now than i did before... and most importantly... I'M HAPPY..  i love this day...

(how i know, don't try to find out... i just know..)  what this day did to me:  ¤i hate myself even more.. ¤i realized that i need  to find a way... *how to die easy* ¤i'm not alone... i could DIE with someone... ¤i started having second thoughts about... stuff...  what i just realized(with the help of my dying friends):  ¤you can never die easy... ¤i hate math... and math hates me... ¤"death, like life... is not easy." -bobbie  what i want to do now after everything  that's happened(and after all the complaints and realizations):   ¤I want to die easy... but then again... i don't want to die easy... i don't even think i want to die.... i guess i'm already dead... panu ka pa mamatay kung patay ka na diba? haha..

(i get really corny when m cheesy... haha.. i dnt think that made sense) anyways...  hmm.. at last i already got what i need from ust already... hehe..

        argh.. i went to ust again..hmm.. it wasn't exactly a really productive visit.. but i got something done.. i have to go back there this thursday.. and honestly.. m ticked off... (a lot)...it would be ok for me if hindi sobrang layo ng pinanggalingan ko.. but that's life... things happen for a reason.. hehe.. what i'm doing is for a cause... it's for me actually... so i guess i'm not rili in the position to get pissed off.. but duh!! as if i could help it.. if i could, i wouldn't be posting this message.. hehe.. i'd be posting something happy.. like.. my crush hugged me or something like that.. hehe.. thing is.. my crush didn't hug me.. hehe.. i just made that up hehe.. haven't even seen him today.. oh well.. got a lot to do.. hehe.. byee...  ps. i dnt have anything against ust.. it's just that super layo tlga nya from where i live.. hehe.. love ko ust kasi nandun karamihan ng friends ko.. but man.. it's really far.. hehe..
