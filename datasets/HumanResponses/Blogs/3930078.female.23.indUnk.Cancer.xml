       You've hit an all time low and start losing sight&nbsp;of things that really matters to you. You can't think straight, it's like letting your irrational heart rule over your head. You screwed up big time. To begin with, You don't even know why you're allowing yourself to be like this. You've been treating someone unfairly. Someone who means a lot to you. Instead of making him understand you and what you're going through, you drive him off the wall with the way you treat him. You start doing things that makes it hard for the person to figure out what your problem is and you end up being more complicated than ever.    You're used to constant communication almost everyday yet there comes a point when you don't speak to each other, like you're both trying to avoid each other. You feel as if he's trying to avoid you yet you're anxiously waiting for him to make the first move and talk to you, while you're trying your best to stop yourself from saying even a simple "hello." But unfortunately, you might have angered him to the point that he doesn't want to have anything to do with you. And the thought just makes you feel like crying.    You regret the way you treated him. For being unfair, for being temperamental, for not thinking, for being stupid. You're sorry. So sorry yet you can't find the words or the guts to make the first move and tell him so. You're hurting in the real sense of the word itself. It's like self-inflicted pain because come to think of it, you started this. There's no one else to blame but yourself. You try to come up with different ways on how to make it up to that person but it doesn't seem to be enough.

I cannot be without you, matter of fact    Ohh ohh ohhhhh, I'm on your back...     &nbsp;   If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you    If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you...     &nbsp;   Another heart is cracked in two    I'm on your back...     &nbsp;   I cannot be without you, matter of fact    Ohh ohh ohhhhh, I'm on your back    I'm on your back    Ohh ohh ohhhhh, I'm on your back...     &nbsp;   If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you...    If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you...    If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you... &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ***To that very special person who means everything to me...you know I'm always on your back... &nbsp;

       Five months ago I met someone online. And between him and me is a special friendship. He's the kind of person you can talk to about anything. As in anything. That's how I felt when I got to know him. We've had endless convos from no-nonsense things to the things that really matter. I've talked to him about my past, my present, and what I want to have and be in the near future. He knows me quite well enough to know when I'm down and something's bothering me. He knows so much about the up's and down's of my recent "failed" relationship.   Well, even from the start, he was always there to listen to me whenever I needed someone to talk to. He's always there to encourage me and make me see the bright side of things. Even when my most recent "failed" relationship was about to crumble, this special person (yeah, he's special alright...very special!) was there for me all the time, unlike my ex.   Isn't that ironic? I mean the person who's not within arms reach is the one who turned out to be there for me all the time. Unlike the person I should be expecting to be there for me was the one who's somewhat "unavailable."   I know I shouldn't compare the two of them but how can I not make a comparison when I can see the big difference between them? At some point, I asked myself what he really means to me. I know there'll be a lot of raised eyebrows and cynic comments when the idea of falling in love with someone thru the net or online relationships or long-distance affairs becomes a topic at hand. I for one, think it was silly but things are changing for me. I find myself falling for someone online and not just that. It's someone who's out of the country. Someone you can't just be with whenever you feel like it. *sighs* The strange thing is, I feel as if I wouldn't mind the distance. I wouldn't mind the separation. As long as the person makes me feel he's always there for me makes me somewhat contented.   I gave "us" a chance. I mean, my relationship w/ my ex. I was constantly disappointed in him but because part of me still loved him, I was hoping at the back of my mind that things will change. I hoped things will run smoothly for us. But it never happened. He failed me and I failed too. I failed to make it work for the two of us.   Eventually, I realized that someone else was making me happy. This person has done a great deal for me. The little things he do. The way he cares, the way he's concerned about me just makes me melt. I'm only human and I can't resist such things.   Now I find myself in love with this person. No hesitations, no second thoughts. I know I feel so deeply for him. I thought that if I finally made a choice to either be happy or stay in a relationship wherein not all things are reciprocated, everything will be okay. But as it turns out, this person has some unresolved issues of his own. Issues that he's still hung up on. That I feel like if I could just take away all the hurt from his past, I'd gladly do so in a heartbeat. But the thing is, he just won't allow me to do that yet. He just doesn't know how much I care for him, how much I wanted to to take care of him, how much I love him.   He never fails to make me feel that he's always there for me or make me feel special. It's an unspoken understanding between us. Like a relationship with no labelling or whatsoever. Sometimes, it makes me anxious to get to the bottom of this. But I know it's not easy coz there are certain things in life that's hard to let go of. And in his case, there's something he can't just easily let go. And that hurts.   I'm still working on coming to terms with that. It's hard especially when you get to spend hours talking to him. For me, those are special moments that I really value. Even if it's just 15 minutes of my break, each conversation is important to me regardless if we really had something to talk about or we're just goofing around. It's one of the things I look forward to each day. To talk to him in every possible way. To let him know that I'm always here for him and that I care. More than what he thinks.   Guess I'm going crazy don't yah think? He! He! He! And because of this, I'm losing focus in everything but not in a bad way. Can't do anything but think of this person, talk about this person, blah blah blah.   It's like a line from one of my fave songs,  "I'm falling even more in love with you, letting go of all I've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move, I'm hanging by a moment here with you..."    Yeah, it's like I'm in limbo. Steady, unmoving but somewhat reeling from the moment. Just waiting for things to fall into place. Waiting and waiting and waiting. Will it ever fall into the right place?   I told myself I needed a break probably from everything and everyone and decided to stay away for some time. I didn't go online for 2 days just to tone down my addiction to chat or addiction to one person so to speak. It's like substance abuse. Like when you start taking a bite of chocolate, you just can't stop eating it till the last bite. And it was one hell of a challenge but I guess I'm weak when he's concerned. I ended up missing him more. I even tried not to look at my celfone but dang, my fingers were itching to make a call and text. Ha! Ha!   In short, I failed. I only made it for 2 days and fell off the wagon so to speak. So, here I am again and I just wonder.....wonder.....and wonder.....

       It's easy to lose yourself to someone's eyes. When you know that someone is worth everything to you, when all the things you love is represented by that one special person. Then you realize you're starting to drown into a deep abyss of unexplained emotions. Mixed with joy and pain, laughter and surprises.   Each and everyone of us is in search of something special, something great, something larger than life. As we begin our journey, there are people who become part of our lives for they have shared something special w/ us. It could be a short-lived romance, an intimate affair, a secret pact, a lifetime friendship, or it could be something else. And as we move on to our destined path, we often stumble and make unwise decisions and always, there's someone who reaches out to offer love, comfort and security.   And then we find meaning in life more than just the word itself. We learn to find beauty and contentment in little things like quiet walks, intimate conversations, a movie &amp; dinner for two, late-night phone calls and other mushy stuff. As we experience these moments, we give in to the giddy rush of love. It's when we feel like there's always a reason to smile, the feeling of butterflies in our stomachs. Then we realize we're losing ourselves to that someone and that the person we are sharing these moments w/ is everything to us.   But in the course of every relationship, there's always a time when we love too much and forget about ourselves. Forget that we also have a life of our own and that there's more than just being with that person. We spend way too much time loving and caring for that person that sometimes, we don't realize that the other person also needs some breathing space. We might not know it but there comes a point when they feel suffocated and pressured that it drives them off the wall. Sooner or later, the other person wants to have some breathing space, some time alone for themselves because they can't quite handle the overwhelming rush of our love for them.   Then we start to have doubts, lose trust and question almost everything which leads to arguments like exchanging of heated words and sometimes physical violence until finally, one has to give up and drift away. As a result, we breakdown, lash out, blame other people for what happened. We even lose sight of what's real and what's not but what we don't realize is that we brought this down to ourselves. We're responsible for what went wrong and this realization comes to us a little too late. Too late to make adjustments, too late to compromise, too late to take back what we have lost. Soon enough, we have to face the fact that we're the victims of our own choices. We have to understand the pain of losing someone and how hard it is to get up on both feet and bounce back.   We always have to learn our lesson the hard way. More often, it takes a lot of heartache and buckets of tears before we realize that life goes on but still, we continue to love inspite of the pain, tears, and heartbreak. Maybe it's the cliche that heartbreak causes pain, pain makes us stronger, tears make us braver, and the painful experience itself, makes us wiser.   It takes time to heal. The pain of losing someone we love always leaves a mark on us. Like an ugly scar that only time can somehow heal as we move on with our life. As we begin to heal and re-invent ourselves, we start another journey. A journey of self-improvement to re-discover ourselves and take pleasure in the things we deprived ourselves before when we we're busy making someone else the center of our universe.   But of course, we soon try to look for someone who could offer the love and affection we need. Someone who would take the time to sit down and talk about simple things like what you want for breakfast, what movie you want to see, or what brand of cologne you prefer. Someone with a good sense of humor, whom you can laugh with. Someone who thinks you look great even if you just crawled out of bed with your hair all messed up and your eyes puffy from sleep. The one person who would take your hand when you need someone to hold on to, the one person to kiss you and hug you tight and say " It's gonna be alright " when the odds are up against you, the one person who would be the last call of the day, the one person at the other end of the line who'll say " Goodnight " and " I Love You Too ."   We might have loved the wrong person and cried for the wrong person but we shouldn't regret that because we learned so much from that experience. Instead, we should remember this one true thing: In this life, there's a very special person who's meant for us. Someone who represents all the things we want in life. It may take some time or even forever before we cross paths with that person but we just have to believe &amp; have faith that the possibility of an honest-to-goodness relationship is just within reach. I guess we just have to look and see for ourselves. Who knows? that person may be the one who could handle the love we can offer, with no hesitations, no questions asked.
