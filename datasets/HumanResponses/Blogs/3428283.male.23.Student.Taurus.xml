      On Saturday, the  urlLink National World War II Memorial  was officially dedicated. In a war where 16 million Americans served and over 400,000 died, it is a wonder why it took so long for a memorial to be built for them. The Memorial honors not only those who died, but also those who survived, those who considered themselves "the lucky ones." While the importance of the National Memorial is not diminished by the passage of time, it does mean that many of those for whom the Memorial was built are no longer alive to see and receive the thanks of the nation. I can't help but wonder why it took so long for these veterans to be recognized, these men and women of, what Tom Brokaw terms it, "the Greatest Generation."

      An institute named after you at UCLA. Terry Semel, CEO of Yahoo has made a $25 million donation to UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute, and it will be renamed the Semel Neuropsychiatric Institute. $25 million... now the question is how much of that money will actually be used for research and how much of it will be used to do even more construction on the campus.  On a separate note, it makes no sense to me that any school or institute can be named after whoever gave it a lot of money. Take the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine for example... David Geffen has nothing whatsoever to do with medicine. The guy was a producer and just happened to have a lot of money he wanted to give away... what does it say about a profession when a school can be named after someone who has made no intellectual contribution to the profession itself?

      The Stanley Cup Finals. Game 7. There is nothing sweeter in sport.  It's official: the NHL season is over and the  urlLink Lord Stanley's Cup  has been awarded to (of all places) Tampa Bay... yes, as in Florida. Who would have thought at the beginning of the season that the Lightning, of all teams, would take home the oldest trophy in professional sport? But hats off to both Calgary and Tampa Bay for one of the best series since, in my opinion, the Vancouver/NY Rangers series of '94. Fine, I'm bitter that the Cup isn't coming home to Canada, but at least a Canadian team made it to the final this year. You know it's a good game when my girlfriend Kathy is watching it with me on TV.  So, the season is over... now what? Many of you will be thinking the draft, off-season surgeries, and training camp... How about none of the above? Yes, the dreaded players' strike is right around the corner folks. Once every few years, the  urlLink NHLPA  and the  urlLink NHL  decide that they will play a game of chicken over the collective bargaining agreement. The central question: who will blink first? Who will give in and make the move towards the middle? Finally, the NHL is getting some exposure in the U.S. (forget north of the border, cuz we've always been nuts about hockey up there) and the seats in the arenas are finally being filled... and of course, the league is going to go on strike and kill all the progress they've made. How likely will there be a season next year, you ask? Well, lets put it this way, a large number of players have already signed, or are negotiating, contracts to play for teams in the elite European leagues. So for those of you who are looking forward to the 2004-2005 season, don't hold your breath... it might be a long, long time before the skates will be laced in the NHL arena near you.  By the way, did any of you know that Jarome Iginla's full name is EIGHT WORDS long?!?!

       urlLink MSNBC  published a piece today reporting that a recent poll, printed in the  Le Parisien , showed that less than 50% of the French population feel that they have a  urlLink moral debt  to the U.S. for the D-Day liberation 60 years ago. The thing that I'm wondering is whether the sentiment reflected in the poll is the result of the French's criticism of the U.S. was in Iraq. It is sad that current events are being used to devalue the sacrifices that so many made in the past. Regardless of the merits and justifications for the current war in Iraq, it does not change what happened in the past. Just as the French argue that the U.S. had no justification for the current war in Iraq, it can be argued that the U.S. had no obligation or reason to drop thousands and thousands of their own into enemy territory to liberate a country who, while touting themselves to be a "Great Power," utterly failed to protect its own, and saw the enemy march through the streets of Paris. No matter the resentment that the world may feel about the war in Iraq, no one can say that what the U.S., as a nation, and as a people, as well as the British, Canadians, and others of the Allied Forces did on D-Day in Normandy do not deserve the thanks of a nation and perhaps even the world. A question that I want to ask all those who said that there is no debt owed to the U.S. is whether they feel that they owe a debt to anyone for D-Day, and if they feel that they are in debt to the rest of the Allies, what makes the U.S.'s participation in 1944 any less important or deserving?  What is happening in today's world has no impact and makes no difference to what happened in Normandy. For those who feel no debt, think that if not for D-Day, France today would be the province of France, not the Republic of France. Those who died in Normandy did not fight so that they can hold you in debt, but a debt is owed nonetheless.
