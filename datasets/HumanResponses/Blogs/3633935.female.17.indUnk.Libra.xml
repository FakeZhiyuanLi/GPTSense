      Hey all, how goes it? Went to watch 'King Lear' yesterday, which was very good but dragged a bit - four hours long! Poor Tom was fantastic, me and Mr Beale had a very heated debate about him (he wasn't too impressed, but I think he was brilliant) I think I won, because Mr Beale told me I was a "Stubborn Creature" and left it at that, which I think meant he couldn't think of a comeback - victory for me! Yay! It was a very good production though (the eye-gouging scene was gruesomely good) but we didn't get back to school until midnight, so most people have been a bit dead today (with the exception of the few who never seem to get tired - grr!) Ellie told me I looked "really rough" this morning, which made my day, cheers El! The rest of yesterday was cool, Mrs Mason was being very funny in drama - Becky's phone kept going off in her bag (it's got a cool message tone like a doorbell) anyway, after about the third time, she turned to the TV with a very worried look on her face and asked "Why is it doing that?" It was very funny, the woman is great! Back to today - the rest of it has been pretty good - english was fab, between Mr Beale calling me stubborn, and somehow getting onto the female obsession with cuddly toys (I love his theory on this, he says that girls like cuddly toys because they're not sexually threatening - when you're feeling crap, you can cuddle them and not have to worry about it going any further. Makes sense if you think about it!) That's about all there is to say, I've got to go to the doctors now to get my shoulder re-examined (its being horrid again), so I shall love you and leave you. Keep smiling xXx   "Birth is pain. Death is pain. The bit in between is pain. All you can do is endure it"  - that's a direct quote from Mr Beale (not from a play or poem he was reading us, just his own words) from our english lesson this morning. Thought I'd share it with everyone to get some feedback - I thought it was a really interesting point. What do you reckon?

      Hey all, how're you? I'm not so bad, still very tired (note to self - must start getting more sleep) Didn't do much today, spent literally half the day sitting in an armchair in the PA block. It wasn't even that comfy, but it was better than nothing. Helped out with Animal Farm after school, which was fun. Lots of catchy tunes in it actually (four legs good, two legs bad, dum dee dum...) Mr O'Sullivan says they have a long way to go, and I sort of see his point, but I do seriously think that they're going to be amazing - best of luck to them! I think some of them think I'm a bit weird though (fair enough, I see their point) I've actually been given some schoolwork now (finally) - practice psychology coursework, woo! (Uh-oh, been spending too much time with Matt! Only kidding, love ya really) It's got nothing to do with the stuff we did at the zoo, so apparantly that was a complete waste of time, surprise surprise! That's about all that's happened today - well it's a Monday, you can't exactly expect it to be hugely exciting, can you? Ooh, I got a bank statement this morning and am now feeling incredibly guilty looking at how much I've spent and how little I have to show for it - great start to the day! xXx

      Oh my God, I actually think I'm dying. I was up until 1am babysitting, had to get up at 5am this morning (don't ask, lots of stuff to sort out, not fun!) worked from 10am until 5pm and from there went straight to a dance rehearsal, which was 4 hours long. It was kinda fun while it was happening, but now that I've stopped I've realised that I'm actually dead on my feet (don't think I've helped my shoulder much either - oh well, I'll live!) Going to go to bed now, too tired to write a long blog, or to try to make this one interesting! Hope you've all had good weekends and are ready for a new week at school (oh, the joy!) Love ya xXx

      Hey guys. How's everyone's weekend going? The zoo yesterday was pretty fun, but we did actually have to work, which was a bit of a shock! I was expecting to just go and see the animals looking cute (shame you couldn't get smuggled along Todd, they were pretty cute) but we had to anaylse their behaviours and draw graphs and stuff! It was so hard - the zoo will be tainted for me forever! Went to work today, which was completely manic. We've got a sale going on, and I've never seen it so busy, even at Christmas! I was so tired afterwards, and I'm doing overtime tomorrow - I'm going to be super fit by the end of it, lots of running about! But I went to watch the matinee of 'Jesus Christ Superstar' afterwards, so that made it all ok - no joke, it was absolutely fantastic! Anyone reading this who was involved, I take my hat off to you, it was amazing! I'm at home on my own at the moment, so I've been having a sing of all the tunes - not quite as good as you guys were, but oh well! That's about it for today, got to go and babysit now - eek, the work never stops!   Just noticed, there are loads of exclamation marks in that blog - oh well, hehe! Ooh, another one! Dammit! *shuts up so can't type any more*

      Hey all, had a good day? Bristol was cool, nice to get a day off school! Saw a few people from school there, which was fun. The courses look good, but there's not much practical drama involved in the course I was interested in, so I'm having a rethink now! The english talk was good, the lecturer compared the students who do english to vampires, which was interesting! Mum nearly passed out when she saw the Halls of Residence (her exact words when she saw the bedrooms were "they look like prison cells!" hehe!) I thought it looked good though, hope everyone else who went had fun, and to those of you who went to Leeds as well, hope it was fab! That's about all that's happened today - my shoulder is still being awkward, Mum grabbed me on the sore spot to wake me up this morning, which wasn't nice! Got to go and dance now, and I get to go to the Zoo tomorrow! Yay! Ciao xXxXx

      Hey y'all Sorry for lack of blogging lately, our internet is being a bit tempermental (I'm sure this is a male computer, if it were a girl it wouldn't be nearly so awkward!) Anywho, life is pretty much the same with me. Had a day with no lessons today, and was VERY unimpressed - came very close to slapping Mr Beale when he said we could leave (nothing personal, I love him really!) I've been to the doctors tonight, and it turns out that I'm not losing my mind and forgetting that I've been whacked across my shoulder, but I've actually got some form of illness - can't remember the scientific name for it (and even if I could, I couldn't spell it) but to put it simply, I've got something like 'Frozen Shoulder' (nice name) so I can't put any unnecessary strain on it or use my arm properly (I can't lift it as high as I should be able to - shame, I do so love being eager and putting my hand up in lessons! Science trio Mog!) Other than that, I've just been to a session at the Everyman, which was very fun, but not too productive because we just talked a lot. Oh well, it was good to see everyone again! Can't think of much more to say, I'm not in school tomorrow because I'm off to Bristol to see the University, so have a good day and I'll see you soon! Love ya xXxXx

      Hey all, how was the first day back? Bit of a shock to the system, but I didn't die, so Shanti, I'm afraid you can't have my scarf just yet! Yesterday was mad, worked for 7 hours, danced for 4 1/2 and was up until 3am with my australian aunt and cousins, who have come all the way from Down Under to go to Butlins (I kid you not, I found that hilarious!) Anywho, they've gone now, so everything's semi normal again (there is no normal in my house!) Had another driving lesson today, and I think this was actually the worst one ever - no joke, I think a gorilla could have driven better! My instructor said I had "too much on my mind" - he's been trying to psycho-analyse me since my second lesson, he says he can't figure me out, which I find quite entertaining! Ah well, I can be a woman of mystery instead...could be fun!

      Yay, it's Saturday! Nikki, how was your birthday get-together? Hope it was fab, sorry I couldn't be there! Went to work today, we're having a sale soon so everyone's repricing, tidying, etc etc. Doesn't sound very interesting, but we did actually have fun (it's that Disney Magic, hehe!) Saw some people from Smike too, that was cool - nice to catch up with people! Also bumped into Holly and Maria, can't believe you've finished for the summer Holly, thats so not fair! I'm back in school on Monday (I still think the shock will kill me) Other than that, the day's been fairly uneventful, so once again not a very interesting blog (well, it's hard to make work hugely exciting without giving away all the secrets of the Disney World!) I think I need to develop a newer and more interesting lifestyle...any ideas?

      Hey guys How's everyone? All who did the italian GCSE, hope it went ok, and now you can celebrate because your exams are finished! Todd, you don't have to worry about people rubbing it in any more (mine finished on Wednesday, hehe!) Back to school on Monday, I think the shock may actually kill me - if I die, Shanti gets my scarf and Matt can have the pic of Tim's bodacious bod (even though it's not a very good pic - sorry Matt, but I don't see a career in photography in your future!) But I get to drop french, yaaaay! I've waited all year for this moment (yes I know, I'm sad). Haven't done much today. Played my flute, wrote a letter to Mog (how are you gorgeous? I haven't spoken to you in ages!) and enjoyed not having to feel guilty cos I'm doing no work - all good! I'm working tomorrow though, and guess what? I'm doing an exam! I can't escape, they're following me! I'm doomed!

      Hey all Feeling a bit better today, I no longer want to shut my head in a car door, which is always good! I picked up my Smike pics today, but they're not fantastic cos my camera wasn't working properly so the flash hasn't gone off in some of them, meaning I've pretty much paid for half the set of photos as plain black. Having said that, there are a couple of nice ones (the one of Tim's bodacious bod is semi-decent), but if anyone from Smike does have a good set of photos, could I possibly have a look and maybe get some copies? Aside from that, I've spent most of the day in bed - not very interesting, but worked for me. Great way to celebrate the end of exams or what?

      Have had a horrible day, mucked up my exam, think I might have offended a really good friend (you know who you are, I'm so sorry, I honestly didn't mean to upset you, I just wasn't thinking and I was in a funny mood - no excuse, I know, but I am genuinely sorry) and generally feel like slamming my head in a car door. Came on to send an email, and thought I may as well do this too, and now I'm done I'm gonna go to bed and cry about my immanent career in the chipshop.

      Help help help, my theatre studies exam is tomorrow and I am going to die! Whoever says theatre studies is the easy way out is very, very wrong, and I will punch them if ever we meet. I've been revising for ages, done a last look over everything today, and still know absolutely nothing! I'm so screwed! Thought I'd come and blog because I was ready to put my fist through the computer screen while I was doing theatre studies - the idea is that this will calm me down and put me back on decent terms with the computer (except that we've never been on very good terms anyway, it's a stupid machine) ahh, this is horrid, I'm going to fail my exams, get kicked out of school and end up working in a fish and chip shop in a hairnet with a greasy old man called Ted. Noooo!

      Hey all! Hows things? I've finally got round to setting up a blog (aren't you proud?) shame I've managed it after Smike - would have made for some very interesting entries! Ah well, it's all in my diary, I'll put some quotes on here when I get the chance. So this will be the diary that I will let other people read, so I'll try not to make it as brutally honest as my actual diary! Anywho, got to go now, got my drama exam on Wednesday and have a few more pages of notes to finish (and people say it's a doss subject!) Hopefully this will be the start of something wonderful (or at least a way to pass the time!) Ciao xXx P.S. for those of you who don't know, the space bar on my computer is a bit broken, so apologies if there are loads of words stuck together with no spaces, it's not my fault, honest!

      Hey everyone, how's it going? Hope you're all OK and enjoying a well earned break - summer is upon us, yay! Having said that, the weather is looking very disappointing even by English standards, so maybe it's not time to bring out the suncream just yet! Once again, I've had a few days without blogging (apologies) but not much has happened, so I figured it would be best not to bore you to death with my antics. It's been nice to be away from school though (not that I've been there for awhile anyway, between being ill and in Wales, etc) so I've been catching up on sleep. Mum took me shopping yesterday (sounds good when you say it like that, but seriously, we murder each other every time we go shopping) yesterday wasn't as bad as some trips, but we did have a pretty vicious verbal bashing session (I don't get it, we get on really well normally, why do we kill each other when we shop?)&nbsp;Having said that,&nbsp;I did get some nice stuff, so it's all good.&nbsp;I went out with work last night to christen the new girl into Disney - not sure why, I think the manager just wanted an excuse to go out! Anyway, that was good fun - we went to Bentleys, and there was Speed Dating going on in the next room. They were showing it on the widescreen TV, so we had lots of fun laughing at everyone in there (we were in the toilets and two of the women came in, one said that the man she'd just been sat with spent most of his time telling her how much his sofa cost - wow, how romantic!) Anyway, I'm going to have to love you and leave you now, hope you're all enjoying your time off! See you soon, keep smiling xXx

      Hey everybody, how're you? Sorry for my lack of contact with everyone, but I wasn't up to school for most of last week, and I've spent this week in Wales with the National Trust building paths, cleaning beaches and tearing down fences (not as much fun as it sounds, but it does make you feel good about yourself) It wasn't bad, we had some good times and I'm taking back some fond memories and some very profound words of wisdom, so I think it's been worth it. I did appear briefly in school on Monday to sort out some stuff (like overdue Library books - £4.24 in fines! I was sooo not impressed, but they went to Charity that day, so it's not so bad!) but I was still feeling a bit out of it and not up to school, so apologies to anyone I offended by not being very communicative. Hope Charity Day went well, we were thinking of you in Wales (we got rained on, hope you didn't!) I've missed out on local gossip for the past week or so, but I've heard some little bits - Congratulations to Sam for FINALLY getting together with Naomi, you're very cute together! Can't think of much more to say, except that I hope that everyone's last week has been fun (Drama people, how was the party? I've heard the vague jist from Becky and it sounds like a very classy affair! Caviar and Champagne, where was I?) Enjoy your summer, I'll see some of you at some point, but to those who I don't, have a fantastic summer and I'll see you in September! Keep smiling everyone xXxXx &nbsp;  Fond Memories of Wales    Mike Brooks (oh, the joys that we shared over that - In the cottage that we were staying in we found the words "Mike Brooks 03" written in the fireplace, and again on the back of a picture frame. We found a train ticket under the photo, so we spent the week trying to piece together the mystery of who Mike Brooks is. We still have no idea, but oh well, we tried!)  Going to the beach with Shanti and seeing a seal (it was very exciting!)  Shanti's profound quote of the week  "I think everyone's part Welsh"    Peter and his red boots (he's the leader, he manages rock bands and is writing a book - what a guy!)  My profound quote of the week - I think this is the most deep thing I've ever said (I know, says a lot about me!)&nbsp; "People often say that someone is as "Happy as Larry". But the term "Larry" is also used to describe someone who is a loner. So if Larry is a loner, why is he so happy?"  Peter's book is full of deep sayings, so he's made a note of that one and says he'll accredit it to me if it ever gets published. Go me!  Cooking on the first night, trying to fit about 12 pizzas, 10 garlic breads and a load of chips into 4 very small ovens - oh, the fun we had!)  Brett, who had his 18th while we were away, and Paul the "Welsh Wizard" who had everlasting energy and climbed mountains in the evenings  The crazy woman who spent all her time in the phone box not talking to anyone. She called Shanti a lurker, which was very funny!  Sam (another leader) getting burned across her face, spilling orange juice all over me...just Sam in general, actually!  Arriving at work two hours late on the Friday because we'd been stuck in traffic coming home. The managers were fine about it, but when I staggered into the store wearing my mismatched clothes and walking boots, and carrying a massive bag and sleeping&nbsp;bag, they had absolute hysterics!    I'm sure there are other memories, but they escape me at the moment (I get the feeling that there's one big one that I'm forgetting, but I'll let you know if it comes back to me) All in all, a very interesting trip! xXx

      Hey everyone, how're you? Hope you're all OK. I'm at home at the moment, I feel like death and I'm having a bad shoulder day (hehe) so didn't make it into school this morning. I haven't done much with the day, just sleeping lots really, can't face doing anything else. But I'm making an attempt at writing an essay soon, which should be interesting - not sure I can deal with the Romantics (note the capital letter, Mrs Lane would be proud) at the moment, but I may as well try to do something! Don't know if anyone saw Animal Farm, how did it go? I'm sure it was fab! That's about all I can think of to say, it's hard to be interesting when you've been asleep for the majority of the day - actually, I did have an interesting dream, I was at school and it was Charity Day and Mr Maye was doing stunts on a Motorbike, it was really weird! Can't remember anything else about it, but if I do I'll keep you posted. Ooh, and Hannah - I remember who it was that I was talking to about you, I'll tell you later. Going to try and start my essay now *whimpers to self* Hope you're all OK, keep smiling xXx

      Heya, sorry for the distinct lack of blogging lately, I haven't been at home much. Not much new to report, life goes on pretty much as normal. We had a chinese woman sitting in on our drama lesson today, which was fairly amusing. Everyone was pretty knackered so no one was giving it any oomph (great word), this woman looked so bored, it was very funny. Her phone rang halfway through the lesson and she properly ran to take the call - nice to know our dramatic talents are appreciated! It was a good lesson though, me and Mary's catfight was great (nearly as good as the sword fight in King Lear, but shorter and with more hair-pulling) and three out of five of us were full of cold (what's up with that? It's July!) so we sounded fantastic - all in all, very productive! Animal Farm opens tonight, best of luck to everyone involved, you'll be amazing! And to everyone going to help, have fun and sorry I can't make it (Todd, if you're doing tech then remember the flag!) Got to go now, sorry this isn't very interesting, I'll have a proper blogging session when I've got more time. Until then, hope you're all ok, keep smiling xXx

      Hey all. Had a good day? Hope you're all alright. Today's been pretty non eventful (yet again) went to work, which was good, but I got a lecture off one of the managers who said I was looking droopy and "not showing Disney Spirit" - if I find out what exactly she meant by that, I'll let you know! We're still in the sale, so another day of being rushed off my feet - the pain, the pain! Decided to go and spend money after that ordeal to try and cheer myself up, and bought some sunglasses and some very pretty flipflops - the cheering up idea didn't really work, but now I have pretty flipflops, so it's all good. I watched my free 'Brother Bear' DVD this evening, which is actually a surprisingly good film - made me cry, but no big surprise there. There are also a couple of games as bonus features, which are very cool (or as Matt would say, amasing with an S, hehe) Other than that, the evening's been pretty relaxed. I almost set the kitchen on fire when I was making dinner (I shouldn't be allowed near a cooker, I'll be the death of us all - and yes, I know that's not really relaxed) thank God my parents aren't at home, they'd have killed me! Hope the weekend's going well for everyone, keep smiling xXxXx

      Hey all. How's everyone? Hope you're OK. Haven't really got much to say, I'm just blogging for the sake of it. Nothing new is going on, aside from I seem to be going for some kind of record to see how many teachers I can get into trouble with - so far I've got:  - Mr Davies (potentially, if he knows I fell asleep in general studies which I think he might)  - Mrs Smee (she locked her office before I could give her my welcome letter, and the absolute deadline was today)  - Some random man (who I don't know but who yelled at me for trying to talk to Miss Jackson while he was with her)  - Mr Beale (because I opened a door into my shoulder and yelled very loudly while he was having a meeting in the next room, which disrupted it a bit)  - Miss Crick (because I haven't made it to afternoon registration for a couple of days)  - And all the library staff, who are after my blood because I've had three of their books since April and now owe them a lot of money. Not a wise move, they're very sensitive about their books. Other than that, nothing new to report. Helped with Animal Farm again today, which was fun, I still think it's going to be great. Other than that, nothing new to report, I'm afraid. Have a good weekend, keep smiling
