       It's been too long...  ... since I've last added an entry, so this one has to sum up a whole-lotta-shiat and I'm going to try and make it short.      Pic of David Alan's   I have to start off with mentioning the new lunch 'hot-spot'. It's a place called David Alan's. It's in East Hanover, I believe, or at least, somewhere near there.  It has all sorts of gourmet food, and it's just so damn good! My fav is the Sante Fe Chicken Salad wrap with lettuce and a bottle of water. Mmm  Mmm Good!  This past Friday I headed over to  urlLink Vanderbilts  in Florham Park, to see a band called   urlLink The Nerds  play, and also to enjoy a few drinks with my co-workers.       Nerdy lead singer    Nerdy guitar player    Ok, so the place was packed, and was totally not what I expected, which is definitely a good thing  . Here's a few pics with me from the night.       Rachel and me    Juan and me.         Ron, Me and Alicia    Ron, Patty, Alicia and Me    Soooo....after getting a lil tipsy, I decided it would be fun to test my motor skills with a little foosball action:             Juan and Me vs. Rachel and Kevin     Needless to say, I did not do all that well, considering I scored at least 6 points for the other team. MY BAD YO! After a bit of dancing, screaming, sweating, drinking & foosballing, we needed to munch on some grindage. [Thanks for that one, Pauly] So we were off to the nearest diner. To give you an idea of how 'slow' the night was at about 12 am, here are some pics.       a turn we took at about 100mph [a little exaggeration there]    just to remind Ali where the hazards are.         what the diner looked like to us, from the road,  i think we were a little sideways      So that was Friday, now for Saturday...dun dun dunnnn. Went to Rhythm and Brews in Pequannock to see  urlLink Stir Crazy  perform. The bar was kinda freaky at first, [i'm not all that used to the 'bar scene', though], but we saw this POSTER of ALI with the "Impossible is Nothing" slogan on it, it's funny because that is what is being posted around our office. How ironic to find it at this bar, so...we took a pic for proof of our findings:      PROOF!!    Anyway, at this 'bar', I finally realized how short I really am, and decided I just HAD to do something about it, so...I stood on the 'step' near the bar, and held on to some random ABC'd gum under the bar counter and made myself tall:      Will, Me and Ken. I'm standing on a step and they are bending down,  how sadly short I be, man.    The only thing I realized from being tall, is that I could see alot more bald spots and a hell of a lot of cleavage. I think I'll leave the height advantage to the guys    The night was long, maybe too long because of the previous night of "oh so much fun" .... and it was just so much fun, I had to leave some things out of this entry. Just looking forward to what this coming Friday will bring. Muuuhahahahaha!

       A day in NYC...Woo Hoo!        Rachel, Alicia and Me.    Saturday, was quite a day, such a day...that I slept until 5:30pm today!! Ok, so I'm totally not used to this. I haven't partied or 'chilled' since I was 18! Not like this at least. [All good clean fun though =)] Here's some people we met along the way ;-)        Alicia and me with NSync.    Yeah, these boys were a bit oily and all, I mean...c'mon now, you have millions of people putting their hands all over your face, your bound to get a bit 'shiny'. Ok...also met the president, he was very quiet and kept immitating me for some reason. What's up with that??       Me and GWBush     All in all, we had an awesome time, even got to pass by a few places where we had some good times on NYE:             Ah, memories, sad how all things must come to an end...aww..that sounds depressing.  But hey, It's all good, 'cause, I met someone new...and here we are together:      His name is Doo.     Anyway, at the end of the day, we were still happy as can be and had a blast, who could ask for anything more?!      Rachel, Alicia and Me....again

             =          Hmmm...  What do the 2 pictures above have in common??? Well, lemme tell ya.... The same guy took both pictures and was aiming for the same pose each time.   Alright...So maybe you had to be there.  If you're looking at the picture above and thinking, "Damn, that guy sure is fine." well, HELL YEAH, you're right he is. The pic is of: [from bottom to top] Alicia, Me and  urlLink Gavin DeGraw . Thas right yo, Gaaaah-Vin Dah-Grahw. Ever see  urlLink One Tree Hill ? Well, Gavin DeGraw is the man/group that sings the main song, and others, for that show. He was one of the 'openers' at the  urlLink Barenaked Ladies  concert that we went to last night.  [Which I must say was friggen awesome, more crazy pics to come  ]  Here's something new, Alicia  [blonde chickie above]  is actually going to be hosting her new blog on here!!  urlLink Click here  to check it out.  Ok, here's a list of events that happened last night: On the way to and from the concert, I drove....Let's just say, it was quite an adventure. I didn't know the roads all that well down there, and all those sharp @$$ turns that usually have those yellow arrow sign thingies that usually represent "slow down, sharp @$$ turn ahead", well...those turns didn't have any signs, so I took them hard at about 60 mph with 3 other passengers in my car. And well, you'd think I'd learn my lesson the first 3 turns I took like that, but...unh uh, NOPE...took about another 4 or so more that night, even put our hands up in the air and rode it like a roller coaster.  WEEEEE!  Also, missed the damn parking entrance and wound up on our way to the airport, unfortunately we didn't get through airport security to hop a flight back to where we were supposed to be heading, HOWEVER, I did manage to make an INSANELY ILLEGAL U-Turn...we'll just call that an Eunay-Bop.  So, then...we're at the concert, Butterfly performs...yeah, let me repeat......"butterfly performs". It was as exciting as watching a catepiller come out of it's cocoon. She was good and all, just the part where she forgot the words and notes and stuff, yanno, that was sorta...um...unimpressive. [Her voice DOES rock however, and I give her major ... [caution, ebonics ahead...] ...PROPS for getting up in front of thousands of people by herself.  Ok, one of the MAIN parts of the night was meeting Gavin and the horrible camera man with a big wad of cash that I just can't seem to get out of my head. Ok......well....that was fun. Nuff said about that topic. You may happen to see some pics of me and Alicia with some Flyer hockey player....well, we took those at the concert...        [Please don't ask]  Hey! Have you ever seen a man buy 3 beers, drop one, take a step, purposely drop another, take another step, purposely drop the last beer, and then make funky eye contact with you and start walking towards you all wacked out?? Well, Alicia and I did, but then...we raaaaaaaan, I mean, we really ran away, out of the stadium/arena actually....and the security lady freaked and screamed at us for running away. Ok, why am I writing shiat that I know no one is going to understand? I dunno, maybe because it's MY journal, and it's about ME, and I'm actually having a conversation with myself here...wtf?! Ok, next event: Crazy drunk man that always has 1 beer in each hand, [1+1=2]  and likes to spill it on chicks, namely Alicia, myself and 'Tracey's Mom', also likes to twirl 'Tracey's Mom' and rub his butt against me and shove face in Alicia's face. So, this picture depicts what we did about that, 'scuse the profanity.        Now, I could go on, and on, and on, and on, and on.....about last night, but it's almost my bed time, and I need to start looking for a life. So...I'm out Yo Homey G Funk Money.

       Spelling mistakes    ** if you could read this without getting ... jumbled ... power to ya, man. **    Yay, finished sizing photos, for this damned website...and yanno what?!? It only took 3 hours! And still...that wasn't even enough time to post 'em up. So..patience is a virtue eh?  I've been reading about this Zen shiat, not that I've been focusing on it, just that the book I'm currently reading mentions a lil 'bout the practicing of it.  Here's a good quote:      "The first level is where you get into thought yet have no thoughts, get into attachments yet have no attachmentsL this means that thinking of removing of sickness is thought. To think of getting rid of sicknesses in the mind is to get involved in thought.  Sickness means obsessive thought. To think of getting rid of sickness is also thought. Therefore you use thought to get rid of thoughts. When you get rid of thoughts, that is called having no thoughts. This is why we speak of getting into thought having no thoughts.  When you take thought to get rid of the sickness that remains in thought, after that the thought of removal and the thoughts to be removed all become nothing together. This is what is known as using a wedge to remove a wedge. When you can't get a wedge out, if you drive another on in so as to ease the tightness the first wedge comes out. Once the stuck wedge comes out, the wedge driven in afterwards no longer remains there.  When sickness is gone, the thought of getting rid of sickness no longer remains, so this is called getting into thought to have no thought.  To think of getting rid of sickness is to be attached to sickness, but if you use that attachment to get rid of sickness, the attachment won't remain, so this is called getting into attachment to have no attachment"       Um...o----k, now if I have any spelling mistakes or mis-typed words it's because I didn't clean my thought, I was thinking about hitting the keys and that made me have thoughts, but then I began to think that I shouldn't think, so I didn't which made me dumb and forget how to think, therefore I think that thinking is a good thing, I think. Uh...ok-time for bed I think.  =0)

       Tired...but not?  Yeah, it's one of those nights man. Got home from Tex. late, JOY!  So, Yeah, I finished this site, ... well the majority at least, just gotta update the pictures page thingy-ma-jiggy.  Thing is...I know I'm going to wind up changing my layout sometime soon...just to have something to do. That's sick and crazy and totally relates to my whole  urlLink idea of being a geek . So, I guess it's cool Yo-Homey-'G'-Funk-Money. Tomorrow I head on back to work, after a week off. This should be quite interesting. Last I heard...there have been no 'changes'. O---k then. Hey here's an interesting site... urlLink Click here .

          	         Seven Days & Seven Nights   I'm not one who's ever really traveled before. I've been to CA, HI, NY, VA, DC, FL, PA. That's about all...sad but true. I've never had an interest to visit the South-West before, until about a year-or-so ago, when I started realizing, I NEED TO GET OUT. Ok, So, A few months ago, I finally had a real reason to get out and 'see the world', or at least, another state.   So on to  urlLink Texas  it was. I hate to brag, but I got to spend a great week, with a  urlLink great guy . It was rainy and a bit chilly the majority of the time, but nothing compared to the North-East chill in  urlLink New Jersey . Goin' back to the good ole state tomorrow night. Making a stop in Ohio first to 'switch planes' Arggghhh. But hey,  urlLink expedia.com , so far YOU ROCK!  The purpose of this journal, is to record my thoughts and etc... so I'm not going to hold back, question is, can the 'public' handle that? Hmmmm... Lots more to write about when I get home, when I have time to 'think'.

          Tolling equipment for molecular distillation           I find this stuff quite intriguing. Thanks to Ms. Molecule, she's helped me find something to occupy my time besides reading up on the  urlLink The Declaration of Independence  and the  urlLink The Japanese Art of War .   Sometimes it's just sick. What is this world coming to?! I try to get out...maybe I just don't try hard enough. So I've gone out a few times here and there, and obviously didn't have all that good of a time, else I'd be going out every night. I prefer to just chill with 'the girls'...as opposed to mixed company of co-workers. LOL...that always lands me in some sort of drama...UGH! Good Clean Innocent FUN...GIMME SOME!

       In reference to the PRIME MOVER entry  The following is a response I received in regards to the PRIME MOVER entry, titled "Just Thinking". It was too long to fit in the comment section, so it was e-mailed to me... dun dun dunnnn      But, if something 'is not' when 'it is', then how does something become  something that it 'was not' ever?  If an object, perceived in one location  in space is now existing in another location in space, did the object move,  was it perceived to have moved or did the viewer move thus changing the  perspective of viewpoint?  If the object existed within nothingingness with  no basis for judgement as to whether or not something is capable of moving,  does it indeed move when in motion?  Most people tend to think one, two, or three dimensionally... that won't  answer the question.  Let's assume several things - nothing is possible;  meaning, the presence, or lack of, nothing is possible.  Nothing is defined  as containing no material, energy and outside influences.  Such a space  could be of infinite size.  If an object were to merge with this nothing,  does the nothingness cease to exist?  Nothing is simple - Occams Maxim says  this is the simplest answer - if you introduce something new, a complexity,  then what's the answer?  What does it become?  Is it possible that something  can become from nothing, without an external action applied to it?  Have we  seen it, I don't think so, is it possible, why not?  And, if we take into account your first paragraph on the Prime Mover, if an  object did enter nothing from somewhere, what does this object become within  nothing?  Is the object the prime mover to nothing, thus perpetuating the  chain of events as you described?  If it's possible for an object to 'just  exist' within the space, because we will assume this can happen, is that the  prime mover?  We live in a circular world with circular thinking.  Evolution takes a step  sometimes and alterss the minds of some people with a glimpse into the  understanding or interpretation of reality, and allows those few to not  think circular.  Are you one of those people?     This just goes to show you, I'm not the oddest/weirdest/strangest person in the world...

        Beyond the freckles...            Hmmm..How does one get a bruise, the size of a half dollar, on their cheekbone?? Let me tell you!  When a girl, a cowardly girl, afraid of all things with 8-legs, looks up at her bedroom ceiling and spies a black blob.....things can get a little chaotic. Here's what happened. I was doing some programming and seemingly lost my focus. I began to look at my wall, and notice how oddly white it was...as I looked all around my bedroom, I thought to myself..."I sure am glad I bought some expensive art while in Ohio to decorate the 'oddly white' walls"...Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted something...not-so-white. In fact, it was a black 'ball' on my ceiling. That sounds weird, eh? A Black ball??? Well...here...this is what it looked like:           ...luckily I had my dog 'KIKO' here to witness this object take form...into...the black ball with 8 legs...AHHH!!!            ...KIKO was a little amazed at this and decided to let out a small whimper and took a step back. I whipped out the can of Pledge that happened to be on my beautifully pledged wooden desk...and shook it up... Dun dun dunnnn... the black ball w/legs had no idea what was coming. I, being the smart girl I am, sprayed the black ball w/legs...with the Pledge. Ok..so it didn't move. It just...um...stood there.  THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN...It began to  try  and crawl...As it did this, I noticed something terrifying. This creature was beginning to slip as it tried to maneuver through the wad of amassed pledge I had sprayed on and around it. Now, as most girls probably know... Spiders don't just slip and fall..they HOP OFF THE WALL AND FALL...and that's exactly what happened here.  The spider took a leap and fell to the soft cushiony carpet and scurried like MAD to find a place to hide. This little bugger was a smart one, he went straight under the plastic carpet cover thing that helps my chair slide around. I tried to squish him under the plastic, but the damned thing just wouldn't DIE. KIKO....nowhere to be found. Finally, about 5 minutes after pounding uncontrollably on my floor, the spider made it's way out. We looked at each other, eye-to-eye for a few moments, and then SNEAK ATTACK!!! I found a book [my favorite bug killing weapon] and squished the HECK out of him. I kept the book on-top of him for a good 30 seconds, twisting and pounding & twisting and pounding him into my carpet. I lifted the book...and alas....HE WAS ALIVE!!! My book had not saved the day! PLEDGE attempt number 2! It was a success!!! Now, I have this lovely wet lemon-y smelling black MASS left on my floor. It sorta looks like this:            KIKO, .... still nowhere to be found.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, as I got on the floor to go under my desk, I hit my cheek on the corner and that's how I got the bruise.  Have I mentioned yet, how clumsy I am?! I should clean up the mess now, but thought I should share. PHEWWW, what a night!

       Just thinking...  "You're probably all familiar with the basic idea behind Aristotle's 'Prime Mover'. Everything that happens is caused by something else. Let's say a heavy rain causes a flood in your basement. What caused it to rain? Humidity. But what caused it to get humid enough? Thus the questions go on. Everything that causes something is itself caused by something else, and we can trace the chain of causes as far back as we like. But sooner or later we've got to reach a first cause that just  was , causing but itself uncaused. This is the Prime Mover. What prompted Aristotle's thinking was the philosphy of Parmenides, who with the help of his paradoxical disciple Zeno proved that motion is impossible. Parmenides proposed the following: If something exists, it  is , and it is not what it  is not . But for this thing to move, it must go from where it  is  to where it  is not . But then it would no longer be what it  is . Ergo, motion, or any other kind of change, is impossible, and this what we perceive as motion and change are illusions."  Thank you, Aristotle, for proving that its logic is circular. Otherwise, I'd be going insane trying to contradict!  Also, thanks to Occam's "razor". Occam's maxim was that the simpler an explanation is, the better. If it isn't  necessary  to introduce complexities or hypotheticals into argument, don't do it; not only will the result be less elegant and convincing, it will also less likely be correct.  See what happens when you think to much?

       I should be sleeping...  This weekend was fun. No pics taken, 'cept of my niece, but...those will be uploaded some other time. Friday was a night at Vanderbilts again, we played some pool, drank some drinks, listened to Big Orange Cone and met some 'new' people. It wound up being an early night for me, home by 11pm. Wooo...am I getting old? ... nah ... Then Saturday, woke up around 2 pm, then realized I wasn't really ready to wake up and slept until 5pm. Wound up having a dream about changing my hairstyle so when I woke up I went out and got some highlighting done. It was a nice 3 hour procedure, that left me sorta broke for the day, BUT...I met an awesome new stylist named Nick, and he gave me some cool 'tips' on places to go and hang since I was new to the 'hot spot' scene. Got home 'round 8:30 talked to a few ppl, and then 'round 10pm, asked my cuz if he wanted to check out some of the new suggested hot-spots. We stopped at one bar that had this HAWT man in a 'wife-beater', black cowboy hat and a cigar playing electric guitar with an awesome rock band. It was friggen awesome, but, the cuz wasn't all for it....lol...so we hopped over to another suggested hot-spot and wound up having a blast, we danced for abt 3 hours, and sweat our @$$3$ off with the rest of the crowd, it was GREAT! Had a BLAST!!! Definitely a new hot-spot to go with Ali and Rach. I can't wait girls, it's going to be FUN!!! Ok, so that is my weekend 'in review'....not too much action, but just enough to get me to where I am now, which is....tired as hell, and about to crash. NITE!

And we can build through this destruction As we are standing on our feet ...And I, all I really want is you You to stick around ...These reeling emotions they just keep me alive They keep me in tune Oh, Look what I'm holding here in my fire This is for you Am I too obvious to preach it? You're so hypnotic on my heart ...And I, all I really want is you You to stick around. ...The words you say to me are unlike anything That's ever been said And what you do to me is unlike anything That's ever been...  urlLink  I love.

       Oh my...  How could I forget?! I saw  urlLink The Passion  on Saturday! Mel did a great job, and the actors/actresses were phenomenal. I would recommend that everyone see the movie, but once. It is extrememly graphic. Alicia and I went together, kinda on a spur-of-the-moment sorta deal, and that place was packed, the movie was even running more than one showing at a time. You could actually hear the audience sobbing during the movie, Alicia and I were part of that. It was very emotional. You hear words repeated over and over when you go to church or even in everyday life, and yet you never truly realize the impact of them and why they are used so often and worn into your mind until you see this movie.  Ok...so...just go see it! NOW!  urlLink www.moviefone.com

       The infamous update...  So here goes...  These past few weeks have been fun. Always keeping busy is a new thing for me.  I'm not too busy, out and partying. Actually, not really partying,  just spending time with friends and enjoying life. Let's start with Bhangra's. ... As mentioned before, it's a bar in Secaucus where my friend Ramsey works. He is the one that we are going to be setting up "Win a date with Ramsey" for, go figure. As soon as he gets me some good frontal pics [fully clothed, of course], then we will start that up. Here are some pics from Bhangra's:       My younger sis and me.        Kevin, Me and Renee     Ok, next event [and honestly, i'm not even sure this is the correct order], The Underpass.  We went to this bar to watch Mina perform.      She's in a band, and they ROCKED. Speaking of Rocked, I have to throw this in the mix for Alicia ...  "ROCKIN' IN THE TAURUS!"  Ok, back to The Underpass... Here are some pics from that night:       Rachel, Devil happy.        Rachel, Alicia & Will        Dave and Me     Ok...next thing...just a random picture of me and my niece:           Ok...next thing...lol...there's just so much, but I can't put so much into words, so look at the pics and go from there...thanks for your cooperation Muuuuhahahahaha.  urlLink Click here to see what makes me hyper.  So, this past weekend we saw Kill Bill Vol. 2 I like the first movie better, there were a lot more fight scenes. Vol 2 had some pretty awesome action scenes, but it was also very drawn out. Eck...A few days before seeing that movie, Alicia and I saw Walking Tall with THE ROCK!!!! Who is....let me just say....GORGEOUS! Mmm, mmm, mmm... This past Saturday the plan was to head out to NYC early in the morning and get in to see the NFL Drafts. Well, needless to say, we didn't make it, b/c of all those damned crazy @$$ fans who had to wait in line 9+ hours before the drafts even started. ARGH. so we walked around the city until TGIFriday's opened up. While we were pacing the city, we took some pics...sorta random, and don't ask. Thanks..       Alicia holding Dog      June riding Dog       By the way, I think I forgot to mention, that this is a picture filled entry   Ok, so finally, we entered TGIFriday's. Here are some pictures of all the fun we had:       Alicia, Nick & Will           Alicia-out of order      Will-out of order        Slow-Poke sneaking up on Will      Will, and his deadly pointers.      LEMONS!!!!                     Although it looked like I was having 'issues' with the lemon, Alicia did just fine:          Here are some interesting things we found in the restaurant:       Just a random BEAST        Oddmentism?      After all this schtuffffy...we went to see The Queen Mary docked. I took some pics, but because this page is sooo full, as is. I'll have to post those tomorrow. I know how much ya'll are dying to see them too!  This entry should suffice for now.  Also, added a new page to this website. You can now view Alicia and My calendar.... urlLink Click here

       News Bulletin    Mount Shasta, California- Joy Glassman was a loving mother. She always wanted her son to succeed in life. Then she went too far. Her sons grew up to be firemen, and Joy intentionally set fires to help their careers. After five fires in one month, she was arrested for arson.   Eunay's Town, New Jersey-  Eunay's Mom was a loving mother. She always wanted her daughter to succeed in life. Then she went too far. Her daughter grew up to be a musician/programmer chickie working in engineering/telecommunication, and Eunay's Mom intentionally bought  a couple MILLION cell phones and stood right next to a cell monopole for hours and made millions of calls, and didn't let one drop. She then called up the cell companies customer service reps and told them what great service the company has in NJ and that we are building all the sites at a great pace. And then she shelled out a couple million dollars to our vendors/contractors so they get paid in a timely fashion and would keep up the good work. After 3 months spent near a FCC Regulated Cell Monopole, Eunay's mom did not go to jail, she is now in the Book of World Records... urlLink See for youself .  Thanks anyway ma...

       Winter to Summer  What happened to Spring?! I go around telling everyone that Spring is my favorite season, so what now?...I jinx myself, and the seasons change from winter to summer. What happened to the 60 degree sunny weather with a 15mph breeze? Now I sit here in the shade sweating to death in the 70 degree sunny humid bug breeding weather...ARGH! Don't get me wrong, I love summer, just would've liked to have been prepared, you know? All my summer clothes are still in storage and I haven't had a chance to 'tan' yet. hmmffff.

       Not an Addict  You know how all those people say they get addicted to things easily, well...I don't, and this test I took, proves it. It's a goverment regulated test, pretty damn serious if you ask me. So take it and see what sort of things you are addicted to.   You're addicted to.....  Nothing!  Your addicted to nothing at all? Well..... ok I guess thats a good thing but come on just think of the possibilities!    urlLink   What are you addicted to? (pics!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Happy Easter...         If you don't already know, Easter happens to be one of my favorite holidays. It's one of those 'low-stress' holidays for me, and also reminds me that spring is a-comin'. I love Spring... I love the cool, but not to cool, and warm but not-to-warm weather and the breeze that comes along with both. I love Tulips, those and Daisies are my favorite flowers, so hence the Spring-time LOVE I have. Ahhh...*happy sigh* ... how happy I be.  Tomorrow...or should I say ... 'today'....I have to go back to work. I had tried to do some work from home this weekend. UGH. Friday night, I ventured out-of-state to a friends. Had a jolly ole time, I must say. Saturday I came back to Jersey, and did a little cleaning, and then headed out at night to a bar called "Bhangra's" in Secaucus, NJ. Went with Renee and Kevin to visit a friend who works as a bartender there. The place got pretty well packed that night...it was nice. Too bad the kaereoke wasn't up and runnin'.  Easter sunday, I woke up around 2pm, had dinner with the fam. at about 5pm, and then acoompanied my friend to dinner at around 8pm [had a salad]. Came home 'round 10ish, and worked on some websites. It's now 3am, and I'm left blogging away.  Oh yeah, I updated my pictures page...check it out. I only have 8 pics on there so far, but will be posting more everyday, it was just taking to long because I'd put one or two up inbetween the other stuff I was doing. I have at least 100 to post. WOO!!! Camera-happy!!! Well, time for bed, have to wake up in 3 1/2 hours!

I am definitely looking forward to that one extra hour of sunlight, it gets me all pepped for summer! YAY! I can picture it now, ... me cruising down the highway, sunroof open, windows down, radio blaring, sunglasses on, getting hit on by all the usual truck drivers...Ahhhh those are the days *sarcasm*...but I REALLY AM looking forward to Summer and the ... um ... ... SUN ... LOL  Ok, also, make sure you check out  urlLink Alicia's Journal . She's going to be posting some interesting commentary and pictures from the "Train" concert we went to tonight..seeing as she was on stage dancing with the lead singer!!!

       Slacker!!!  Yeah, uh huh...that's me, I've been a slacker this past week or so. So let's see..what has happened since, the last entry... Well, the 26th went to Vanderbilts, had some drinks, heard The Benjamins play a few songs, watched some co-workers play pool..yadda yadda yadda. That place is becoming to 'usual' for me, don't think I'll be heading back there anytime soon. S'all good, 'cause on the 27th me and the girls hit the Colorado Cafe for some boot scootin' fuuuuun. We had a blast, I brought the cam and doo, ride was there too, but too bad I didn't bring the cam IN with me. I could've gotten some great shots. But ,... since there are no photos to show, let me enlighten you with a few visuals: The place was huge, lots of different 'holes' to get lost in.  Learned how to do the 16 step. Lots of different bar areas, live music and DJ's representin' in different areas. Couldn't find the mechanical bull :( Big dance floor Very mixed crowd, 21 & up, of course...there were a lot of cute people there, men and women! Alicia was out on the floor the majority of the night doin' her thang, with some red-headed freak boy, then some older james dean type [great leader mmm] and as usual Alicia and I both got hit on by the same guy..he was all snazzed out with his cowboy boots and hat, lookin' all fine from a distance. Then he came in close and started spitting on me while he was talking and feeding me some lines to get me to go out and dance with him. I turned him down once, but he came back for more. Some men..no class ;) OMG, I saw someone I met and have been trying to avoid... not cool, maybe I should take down the list on the right that tells people where I'm going to be. This boy should learn that STALKING PEOPLE IS NOT COOL! Buddy, if you're reading this..BACK OFF! Hmmm...Rachel had her share of 'hit-ons' too..you go girl, that person was even waiting for you when you were leaving the building! Dun dun dun... What...else... Last night I went to a  urlLink 'drifting'  event. I've never been to an event like that, but I had a great time, there was a lot going on, lots of nice people there too. I'll have some vid. footage up here in a bit. GO CHACHI!!! Today, I'm home sick and get to vent...so here I go... "I HATE BEING SICK!"

        My birthday...in review.  I'm just going to post pictures as usual, besides, who really reads these things anyway?? Just a quick rant as to what happened. Um...Went to the Black Bear in Hoboken 'round 9 ish, the plan was to make our way down Washington Street to Maxwell's to hear a band play, but we never made it out of the Black Bear  . Met some new people, got a lil too tipsy, but all-in-all had a really great time.  I noticed I had 11 voice-msgs, and like 19 missed calls...sorry to all y'all who went to Maxwell's and were waiting/looking for me. Hope you had a good time too!!!      Here are a bunch of pics of me and my friends, in different views. And other random people        Do you see the 8??        Me, Rachel and Alicia squeezed into a bathroom big enough for a squirrel.        Alicia, Me and Rachel at the beginning of the night        Me, Alicia and Rachel, the typical closeup shot we always take.        Will, Me and Rachel at the beginning of the night here too.        Will, Me and Rachel again.        Me and Justin chattin' about computers, what geeks        Pic of me and some really tall guys [Dave(6'8"), Me(5'1"), Justin(6'1") & Steven(6'7")] go figure, the basketball game is on in the background.        My younger sis, Renee, and Me.        Renee and Me...again.        Me dancing with Aaron.        Me and Aaron still dancin'.      Lots happened, but we were all a little 'pre-occupied' to keep taking pics LOL, and well...that's all folks!

        Momma's Day        Here's a pic of Ma, Me, Renee, Dawn & Jacqui on the deck on Mother's Day         Another view of us      I woke up late. Around 2pm-ish. I opened my bedroom door, and saw ma standing in the hallway, went up to her and gave her a hug and said Happy Mother's Day...but where was everyone?  It was almost like a 'twilight zone' episode. I thought I had slept through the whole day, especially when Ma said everyone had come and gone already...[now you know where I get my sarcasm from, thanks ma!]  Just around 4ish the family started rollin' in. First Dawn and Joe and Jacqui, then Renee...oh, and Kevin was here, but he was trying to wake himself up the 3 hours we were looking for him. He even bought my mom a card. It looked something like this:           And it had a coupon type thing in it, that looked something like this:           All I can say is...what a sweet thoughtful nephew...muuuhahahahahaha!  While eatin' our BBQ schtuffy, we took some pics of the "Fabulous" Miss Jacqui:       My niece, Jacqui, drinking her bottle all by herself         Jacqui after pulling the clip out of her hair, how cute!      All in all, we had a good relaxing day, weather was great too.   Later that night, my younger sis, Renee and I decided to chill.          Then we heard a noise coming from outside...hmmm           Eck, we started to get bored, but thought hey, let's have a pillow fight??           After all the excitement, Renee decided she needed to meditate. Um...yeah.            So...that's what Mother's Day is like at my house...hope yours was just as eventful.

       It's true, but I'm not bitter...  Woman-hood SUCKS, but being a woman ROCKS!   For the men/boys out there, here's an insight into why women are crabby:              We start to "bud" in our blouses at 9 or 10 years old only to find anything that comes in contact with those tender, blooming buds hurts so bad it brings us to tears. Enter the almighty, uncomfortable training bra contraption the boys in school will snap until we have calluses on our backs.   Next, we get our periods in our early to mid-teens (or sooner). Along with those budding boobs, we now bloat, we cramp, we get the hormone crankies, have to wear little mattresses between our legs or insert tubular, packed cotton rods in places we didn't even know we had.  Our next little rite of passage (premarital or not) is having sex for the first time which is about as much fun as having a ramrod push your uterus through your nostrils (IF he did it right and didn't end up with his little cart before his horse), leaving us to wonder what all the fuss was about.  Then it's off to Motherhood where we learn to live on dry crackers and water for a few months so we don't spend the entire day leaning over Brother John. Of course, amazing creatures that we are (and we are), we learn to live with the growing little angels inside us steadily kicking our innards night and day making us wonder if we're having Rosemary's Baby.  Our once flat bellies now look like we swallowed a watermelon whole and we pee in our pants every time we sneeze. When the big moment arrives, the dam in our blessed Nether Regions will invariably burst right in the middle of the mall and we'll waddle with our big cartoon feet moaning in pain all the way to the ER. Then it's huff and puff and beg to die while the OB says, "Please stop screaming, Mrs. Hearmeroar. Calm down and push. Just one more(or 10 ) good push," warranting a strong, well-deserved impulse to punch the ***** (and hubby) square in the nose for making us cram a wiggling, mushroom-headed 10 lb. bowling ball through a keyhole.  After that, it's time to raise those angels only to find that when all that "cute" wears off, the beautiful little darlings morph into walking, jabbering, wet, gooey, snot-blowing, life-sucking little poop machines.  The teen years. Need I say more?  The kids are almost grown now and we women hit our voracious sexual prime in our early 40's while hubby had his somewhere around his 18th birthday.  Now we hit the grand finale: "The Menopause," the Grandmother of all womanhood. It's either take the Hormone Replacements and chance cancer in those now seasoned "buds" or the aforementioned Nether Regions, or, sweat like a hog in July, wash your sheets and pillowcases daily and bite the head off anything that moves.  Now, you ask WHY women seem to be more spiteful than men when men get off so easy INCLUDING the icing on life's cake: Being able to pee in the woods without soaking their socks...   Now I love being a woman but "Womanhood" would make the Great Ghandi a tad crabby.  Women are the "weaker sex"? Yeah right. Bite me!

              Yeah. This picture somewhat has something to do with what I do. C'est la vie, eh? Anyway. Work was rough this week, really rough. I've been trying to recover from Jet-lag and pharyngitis along with the thought that there were going to be major layoffs by the end of the month, meaning today of course. I would call that a bit of short notice. How ..... nice. Luckily, this phase, I wasn't cut. Doesn't mean there aren't 'motives' being played out in the corporate world just just phase me and my fellow co-workers out by other means. Layoffs have been happening since the 2nd Qtr of this year, and I'm sad, I miss all those that have left. :( Work is not only about making money, but you have to enjoy what you do, and in order to do that, you need a good environment to work in, and good people to work with or interact with. Well, I LOVE the people in my office, that is probably 80% of the reason I love my job, and 20% would be the actual work that I do. Without that 60% I'd give 0% of the 97% productivity I give now. Ok, enough about work. I'm one of those girls that doesn't like to "take work home" with her. I wrote it down, it's out and gone. *poof*

       Some of my 'quirky' obsessions  I've left "lonely boy" and I'm ready and rarin' after my 1 hour of 'sleep' *wink* for a blog entry before work. I've decided to note a few of my obsessions, because...that's just my M.O. I do random things, and like random things. I think everyone has their own odd obsessions, but few are able to admit them.    This here, would be lip gloss. Yes, I am a lip gloss fiend. I have about 25 different brands, all in light shades of pink and clear, like the one above. The only down-fall to wearing lipgloss, is that sometimes...the best ones are the stickiest ones, and having your lovely hair down on a windy day, can tend to be more than you bargained for. My hair always gets blown onto my lips and sticks there! I've learned to find the 'less sticky' lip glosses and even though they tend to wear off quicker than the stickier ones, it's worth NOT having my hair stick to my mouth. For instance, a few nights ago I went to bed with 'sticky' lipgloss on, only to wake up with dog hair all over my mouth, some even creeped INTO my mouth. [Yes, I let my dog sleep in my bed] I had the joy of explaining this horrible 3 hour hair removing tragedy to a date of mine the next day. [how embarrassing for most, but I have no shame]   I love everything white. I don't NEED everything to be white, but in my future dream home...I want at least 1 room where almost everything is white. [see the  urlLink about me page .] It would be a room for me to go into to escape the chaos of every day life and enjoy the simplicity of a solid 'shade'. Ok..that sounds lame, but I don't know how else to explain it.   I love red seedless grapes. Even better if they are peeled  . I not only looove to eat them, but I love plastic grapes too! [just to squish and for decoration of course.]   I love funny looking animals, such as the Sphinx above. Actually, I love all animals, anything that breathes, I guess. Does that include plants? I know it includes people...and yeah, I love people. Hmmm.   Ohhhh I can't resist big fluffy marshmallows. Maybe this goes with my liking of everything 'white' but...even the smell of marshmallows makes me melt! My younger sister and I used to come home from school and whip out a bag of marshmallows, and roast them on chopsticks over our stove...mmmm. I just love burning them, and pulling off that top layer, eating it, and roasting the rest over and over. [Not a pyro..I swear!] I'm telling you, the man who brings me a bouquet of marshmallows, will be the man I marry. *happy sigh* hehehe.  I know there are more weird obsessions that I have, but this should suffice as entertainment for now.

       Time for bed?  My bed looks so inviting, I mean...just look.   I feel bad that he's just laying there all by himself, and I'm sitting here writing entries in binary. I guess this is the downfall of having a brain. [by the way, I think my binary might be a little off on the previous entry].  WOW..Look, I have this gorgeous lonely boy laying in my bed, prob. having sweet dreams of me, and I'm here, thinking about my binary blog entry... what is wrong with me?  I think I'm going to go join lonely boy now. *happy sigh*

       White House Staffer, eh?  What do you think? Is it accurate for me?    Wackiness: 24/100 Rationality: 66/100 Constructiveness: 76/100 Leadership: 26/100    You are an SRCF--Sober Rational Constructive Follower. This makes you a White House staffer. You are a tremendous asset to any employer, cool under pressure, productive, and a great communicator. You feel the need to right wrongs, take up slack, mediate disputes and keep the peace. This comes from a secret fear that business can't go on without you--or worse, that it can.  If you have a weakness, it is your inability to say "no." While your peers respect you, they find it difficult to resist taking advantage of your positive attitude and eagerness to take on work. You depend on a good manager to keep you from sinking under the weight and burning out.     Take the test!  urlLink Click here

       O'ahu...I miss you!!!  *sigh* I can't believe my vacation is over, and....recovery is a b*tch!  Me, Alicia and Rachel went to Hawaii together. Main point of the trip was for my family reunion. Then, my sister started inviting people, so I thought...Hey, why don't I :)  So..I did. [And yes...we are still friends after 144 hours together]  We did soooo much.  Arrived on Thursday night, long as flight but there were no delays...if anything, we were early.  [GO  urlLink NorthWest Airlines !]  When we got in, we through our luggage down, looked out the balcony door and notice... Diamond Head was right in front of us, and to the right...was the BEAUTIFUL ocean and Waikiki Beach. We went to dinner, and sat on the beach that night. We took lots of funny photos, that will be posted in a later entry. We basically, did-it-all, from Tours of the island, Dole plantation, the Arizona, Pearl Harbor, Snorkeling, Luau, Dinner Cruise, Going to the beach, tanning, burning, sun poisoning, swimming in the pool at the hotel, kaereoke, my family reunion, dancing at the club, learning to Hula, got tattooed up, bought some cool hats and met a cool&nbsp; guy..like&nbsp;I said...you name it, we did it, and all within 6 days!   Believe it or not, Hawaii is not as expensive as people make it out to be. If you catch the deals at the right time, it's definitely worth it! Go to...  urlLink hawaii.com . That's what we did!   There are so many deals out there too, everyone is trying to make a buck with the tours and luaus and other events. We went snorkeling for $7.95!!!!   Also, make sure you choose your 'company' wisely ;)  I lucked out and had great people join me on the trip.   Here are some photos, more to be posted shortly!         Rachel, Me and Alicia with Ride, Doo and Slow-poke, at the Newark Liberty Airport        The Noodle Shop next door to an icecream shop at the Honolulu International Airport. I haven't seen these on the east coast.         The beautiful open Pacific ocean                  Look how clear the water is! Nothing like the Jersey shores!!         Mountains!         Mountains and our Rental car :)         The people out there were beautiful. Men &amp; Women...for all you girls...here's a boy         For all you boys, here's some girls.         Rachel, Alicia and Me drinking out of pineapples....mmm!         -The parking lots are sooooo small.  -The people are sooooo tan.  -The tour guides ROCK!!  -Don't use rented snorkeling equipment. [I got pharyngitis from the germs!]  -Hanauma Bay and Kailua Beach are friggen AWESOME. Those are the two places you have to go if you visit O'ahu.  -Waikiki beach is sooo touristy, there is barely any space to put your towel down on the beach.  -Dukes smells funny at night. [must be the barefoot bar]  -Moose McGillycuddys became a regular for us.  -Dancing Queen done on Kareoke by 3 Jersey girls....let's just say..lots of giggles and we gave Rachel the SOLO most of the time.  -Jet Lag is rough, still recovering.  -The salt water is GREAT for the hair ... seriously... no sarcasm there, ask Alicia!  -When you get sick, you might snore...shhh!  -Basketballs can be dangerous when they fly out of mid air and land on your head.  -some Hawaiians never heard of New Jersey :(  -The sunsets are unbelievable  -Too much seafood  -Thank God for A/C

       Hawaii, here I come!  &nbsp;  It's 8:30 pm...I'm leaving for the airport in less than 12 hours. I'm soooo excited, really, I am.  I have sooo much packing to do. Laundry is drying and the house ... it's a mess.  Hmmm...what to do??  I guess that's where this entry comes in. I'm too physically and mentally tired from the week I had at work, to get up off my butt and do some useful work.  Work has been crazy, our databases have been inaccessible for the past week...work has been slow...but slow in a way that makes me have to work harder...does that make sense???  All I know is....it's going to be one crazy week in the office, and I actually wish I was there to help things run a little more smoothly for people.&nbsp;[i know that sounds fake, but I don't think anyone from work actually reads this, so i have to admit, it's the truth]  &nbsp;  I'm all hawaiian-ized right now. semi tan from the fake and bake machines at Hollywood Tans [which I loooove] and got my hair tied back with a hairband with a flower on it...wearing pastel colored pjs with hawaiian flowers on 'em... ahhh...all i need is the sound of the waves and dolphins... *happy sigh* TOMORROW BAYBEE!!!  &nbsp;  I went through my list of things to pack, and I think I am forgetting something...I even took my friend's advice and wrote on my list..."don't forget the list"&nbsp; =)  &nbsp;  Just called my friend, b/c she was supposed to&nbsp;swing by after work to pick me up so we could carpool to my other friend's&nbsp;house...but...i told her to go there without me,&nbsp;and&nbsp;to pick me up later, i was thinking like 7ish so I could&nbsp;finish packing and all...and here it is 9pm, and I've got at least another hour to go to finish everything up. It's sad when your&nbsp;friends&nbsp;know you so well that they say something like "Well, I was&nbsp;thinking you were going to call around 11pm"...haha  &nbsp;  Ok...with all this  typed  and done...I'm off to prove them wrong...I'll call them back by 10:55pm&nbsp;... that's my official guarantee.  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm off!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       go ahead, hit me me ...  I know I've been bad.   Here's the deal people. I've been busy. Really, I have been. It's all about the 'people' these days. That's my excuse. I've been living up the single life a little too crazily [that a word?] lately, and I think it's time I just 'chilled' haha. I've been dating, and I guess it's about time I added that portion of my life to this here journal of mine. My dating life has been an extremely eventful learning experience for me. I've come to the conclusion that YES, I'm definitely ready to settle down with just one person.  I am a girl who has had 3 serious relationships, (2) 2 year ones and (1) 5 year one, by the age of 23. I never had the oppurtunity/chance to date, and once I became single [in dec '03]...I decided, I just needed time to myself, to experience life...independently. HA! How short that lasted. By March I started dating ... had a date almost every night for about 3 months. With a lot of different guys who I've seen more than once. Had maybe 4 or 5 only one-daters...and met one real psycho. Anyway...so I met all these people, hung out with them a few times, and now...I've realized what I DON'T want in a partner.  This being said, can you understand why I took a month off from blogging?  More to come, time to sleeeeep!

      YAY!! The big day is a-comin' once again. I lived on my own from 18-23, then back in with ma Jan 2004 - Present day... It's been 'fun' but, once you're out on your own, it's almost impossible to come back home to stay. Yes, the thought of saving money was appealing, but that was then, this is now, and it's all about quality of life.  Rachel and I had decided months ago, that we both need to move out of our current living situations. She's a great friend of mine and luckily, she's a dependable one at that [then again, i don't have any friends who aren't]  anyway...  we started hunting for apts back in the beginning of this year, but really wanted a Duplex/Townhouse/Condo with at least 2 bedrooms, it was hard to find and there were no vacancies in the area. We stopped looking for awhile, because we were also going to be going to Hawaii for vaca...Now that that is done and we are back, I need to get out....You don't even know how bad!  So...I got a phone call from a place i called months ago for a 2 bedroom apt that is a duplex [2 floors hehe] and..it's avail Sept 1,2004. "I'LL TAKE IT" is almost what i said over the phone. Rachel and I checked it out the next day during our lunch break and it was perfect!   The next day we got a phone call that our application for the apt was approved and are putting our deposit down this monday, and moving in on Oct 1. I'm sooo excited!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ok *splat*

        Went to the park in this beautiful sunshining humid weather where I wound up sweating like a pig and getting eaten alive by mosquitos. Sounds sexy eh?  I was even sporting my "Get More" t-shirt, capri jeans with an oil stain and black flat mary janes. Talk about coordination. Ooooh yeah, but...it was worth it, I got to snap a few pics of my niece while I was there.         Look how much she's changed!  urlLink  Click here  and go to the March 20th entry

          Fiddle Faddle Rocks. Yes, it leaves you with sticky fingers and lock jaw trying to get the caramel off your teeth...but it's hella worth it.

          Yeah, I don't know what it is, but guys who have lots of upper body tattoos...well they are like 10 notches higher on the 'attraction' scale, than a guy without...   To me at least.  A guy who is preppy, conservative, intelligent and is able to cover them up with a long sleeve shirt when need be. The kind of guy that no one would assume would have tattoos. Mmm...I love it!

              I  THINK  the guy I went on a date with on Saturday night, is a Scorpio. Something to do with a number in his IM screen name. Hmmmm.  Ok, so I'm believer in this Zodiac compatibility stuff. I guess it's because when I read my Taurus profile it fits me to a "T" and mostly, fits other people too. Oddly, I've noticed, that even though a female Taurus and male Scorpio may be sooo very compatible, a male Taurus and a female Scorpio, may not be.  That's just my opinion though.

      All throughout my life, I've been best suited, relationship-wise, with Scorpios. I don't know why, but we are the most compatible. Even my ex-fiance was a Scorpio, we lived together for 5 years, and had awesome communication and still do to this day even though we are broken up.   I took the  urlLink Zodiac Compatibilty Test  and this is what IT had to say:   Eunay, the best Zodiac Match for your personality is Aries   Aries, the Ram (March 21 to April 20): This adventurous and energetic partner is just your type. Initially, an Aries is likely to catch your eye with their flirty charm and social ways. But as you get to know them better, you're apt to be even more drawn to an Arian's strength and confidence. People born under this sign typically know what they want out of life. They're also usually ready with a well-drawn game plan of how to achieve their dreams. In matters of the heart, don't expect your Aries to get too sentimental. Just be satisfied that this partner will both be generous and have an eye for quality. In the bedroom, you're apt to find the Ram to be a passionate lover with a robust sex drive. It's just one more way that Arians try to get the most out of life and live it to the fullest — even if that means sometimes living on the edge.  hmmmm...I wonder about all that... Seems like a good match for me, I have yet to date an aries, but...I can tell you this much...me and Geminis...we don't click, so all you Aries out there, BRING IT ON.

      Take the test yourself :  urlLink Tickle's Original Inkblot Test  I guess it's true...I'm a peaceful person    [I know, Iknow...boring.]   Here's what my results were::  Your subconscious mind is driven most by Peace   You are driven by a higher purpose than most people. You have a deeply-rooted desire to facilitate peacefulness in the world. Whether through subtle interactions with love ones, or through getting involved in social causes, it is important to you to influence the world.  You are driven by a desire to encourage others to think about the positive side of things instead of focusing on the negative. The reason your unconscious is consumed by this might stem from an innate fear of war and turmoil. Thus, to avoid that uncomfortable place for you, your unconscious seeks out the peace in your environment.   Usually, the thing that underlies this unconscious drive is a deep respect for humankind. You care about the future of the world, even beyond your own involvement in it. As a result, your personal integrity acts as a surrogate for your deeper drive toward peace and guides you in daily life towards decisions that are respectful toward yourself and others.

      Here are some bad pickup lines that I've heard in the past few months...  ~*~Some guy came up to me, with his hand out as if to give me something...as he opened it up, he said: "It's my breath from when you took it away.  ~*~This one a guy in Morristown told me...He got my attention though. "Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?"  ~*~A famous one, makes you think, but also gets a convo started and a little laugh. "Don't you know me from somewhere?"  ~*~Ok, this one REALLY got me, this guy tried hard, and it worked. This is how it went. "Excuse me miss? You dropped something back there?" I started looking around and I said "Where?!" and he said "Over there!" and again I ask "Where, what did I drop?" He answered back... "My jaw!  ~*~I personally liked this one, only because it made him look lame and it was funny-cute: "You make me want to get a job!"  ~*~This is one I get through IM alot, what's the deal boys?! Here goes: HIM: "I know how to please a woman."   ME: "Then please leave me alone."   I know there are a bunch of crazy pick-up lines out there... Guys, I know it's hard to pick-up a girl these days. They usually go to bars with friends, and if they are with other girls, it's hard to approach them without looking desperate, just don't try so hard. Most girls, who go out...wanting to meet guys, will let you know if they dig you via eye-contact or a smile or brushing up against you while walking by. Most girls who are excessively loud are striving some sort of attention. But...beware, they may want your attention and would be open to have you talk to them or something, but sometimes they can be the type of person who just likes general attention and isn't afraid to put you down - loudly. LOL.  Ok...I guess that's the end of this entry.
