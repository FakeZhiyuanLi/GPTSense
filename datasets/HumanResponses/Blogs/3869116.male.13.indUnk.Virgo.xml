       Lol. Today in chat, I proposed to the following: TOFFEE, OMB, GELLE, PILIKA, and SMS. Sms said yes, we got married and had a honey-moon. &nbsp;  Forum Journal  Well, as I said, I got married to SuperMarioSisters today. We went on your honeymoon, then got divorced. It was a fun day in The Cave. I watched SmackDown to see if I could find MetalMario but I couldn't. &nbsp;  Personal Journal  Nothing...nothing at all.

       Yay! Blog is up! You can all read my journal. It will have two parts; Forum Journal and Personal Journal. Well...here goes...   Forum Journal  Well, nothing really went on for me today, except in chat, that was fun. For some reason, I can make it to chat everyday, but somehow only go on when Mac moderates. It's fun. I normally sing "She Bangs" and everyone sings along. I get muted for around 20 Seconds. Then, chat was slow, and I had 3 posts in a row, so I made 4 and 5..then Mac muted me again...and from there on out, I couldn't talk...So, I went for Chat #2, The Cave. I kept saying "*kisses tww10*" which ended up being the last post. To bad the chat posts are broken :(. To see the pic, go  urlLink here.    My Personal Journal  Once again...not much. Well, maybe one or two things. This girl I've liked (at one point LOVED) told me she had a crush on me, but since I cannot drive a car, and barely see her (that will change...:P) I haven't asked her out. She says she doesn't want a boyfriend right now, and I'm cool with that. Also while I was picking berries, I didn't feel so good, I've napped for about 3 hrs today. Currently, I am feeling better :)
