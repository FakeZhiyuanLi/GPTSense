      I just re-read the Vicious Poster's comment...  She mentioned something about bar-hopping.&nbsp;  Bar-hopping?&nbsp; Who goes bar-hopping?&nbsp; WTF is she talking about?   And also, it might surprise you to know that the number one selling item in the PXs over here are DVDs and PlayStation and XBox.&nbsp; EVERYONE here has them and everyone plays them into the wee hours of the night because we all need an escape from the day.&nbsp; So me playing Max Payne for an hour is not unusual.&nbsp; In fact,  I don't know of a single unit who doesn't have some sort of entertainment center set up for their soldiers to play video games. &nbsp;&nbsp;It's not my job to try to convince you that what I am doing is worthwhile.&nbsp; You obviously feel the need to try to start some shit.&nbsp; So piss off.    And  , you moron, you are obviously not the brightest star in the sky.&nbsp; Your husband served in an operation you can't even spell!&nbsp; It is Desert Storm, you idiot, not "dessert storm".&nbsp; And it is capitalized, as all names of military operations are.&nbsp; Duh.  You don't know me, Pediatric Oncologist, but if you did, you would realize that you just opened a can of whoop ass.&nbsp; I'm only 25 years old, but I am responsible for the lives of 117 of America's sons and daughters, and I conduct combat operations every day in some of the most dangerous cities in Iraq.&nbsp; I have earned 3 medals in this operation   so far  , and my soldiers respect me and trust me because they know that if given the opportunity, I would step in front of them and take a bullet so that they wouldn't have to die, and I know they would do the same thing for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Because that is how it works over here.  &nbsp; The person you play rugby with one day&nbsp;is the person who may be saving your life on the next mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce loyalty.&nbsp; I'm the wrong person for you to be messing with, you ungrateful bitch.

      By now, most of you are aware of the asshat who insists on posting hateful comments to my blog.&nbsp; I don't feel the need to explain myself or even to respond to her vicious comments, but if any of you are wondering why I am able to blog so often, I should tell you it is because as an officer, I plan the missions I go out on, and I have to have access to email and maps and Operations Orders.&nbsp; And usually, I blog early early early in the morning, on my own time, when I have trouble sleeping because I've just seen someone get blown to pieces and I'm having nightmares about it.&nbsp; But I digress.   Anyways, I'd like to prevent the Vicious Poster from leaving any more comments...I'm kind of computer illiterate, so I just deleted the last comment before most of you had a chance to read it.&nbsp; I think I'll do the same unless someone can tell me how to delete a specific IP address.   And in the future, I'll probably just ignore those comments.&nbsp; I mean, after all, she is in America, enjoying the luxury of freedom of speech...

      I'd like to quickly post something in reply to what someone else posted on my blog yesterday.&nbsp; I deleted it, because it was rude and stupid, but basically, it said something to the tune of:  "What is it that you do over there that is so important that you have so much time to blog all you want, play rugby, and play PlayStation?"    &nbsp; Well, first of all, I&nbsp;laughed because obviously, this person, (who didn't even have the guts to sign their name!) hasn't read anything in my blog.&nbsp; It is filled with my thoughts on the war, the patrols I go on, and all the battles waged over here.&nbsp; So obviously, they didn't know what they are talking about.  Secondly, yes, I play rugby (when I'm not on patrol).&nbsp; Yes, I played PlayStation (that was the first time since I've been here that I played, though).&nbsp; And yes, I had wonderful pasta and watched a couple movies with some friends of mine.&nbsp; I will not apologize for any of that, nor do I feel that I am wasting taxpayers money by doing those things.  In return for the   very very   few luxuries I have, I also: -patrol Baghdad 4-5 times per week, usually for about&nbsp;6-8 hours at a go -act as an interpreter while on these missions, which is not my job, but I do it anyways because I speak a little Arabic and it makes us less likely to be SHOT -worry, each and every day, about the lives of my soldiers, my friends, and myself -fly missions all around the country via Blackhawk helicopter -brave unbearable heat, the possibility of IEDs, and mortar attacks while trying to "rebuild" this nation -worry about my family back home -worry about my husband, who is North of here in a more dangerous area -pray over the dead bodies of friends&nbsp;of mine killed here...so far, I have lost   two   dear friends -try to remain a positive outlook on life  So, you spineless, sheltered, ungrateful, selfish, un-patriotic dirtbag, my life is not easy.&nbsp; I work very hard.&nbsp; Every.&nbsp; Single.&nbsp; Day.&nbsp; I just try to keep the blood and guts and sadness out of my blog so that I don't bring everyone down when they read my blog.  And regardless of what you may think of the job I do, or how much of a waste this whole ordeal might be to you, I am still over here, protecting YOUR right to bad-mouth me.  What do YOU do?

      Last Sunday was the best day EVER.&nbsp; I came in to work at the normal time, but I goofed off most of the morning, went to&nbsp;mass with Rob, my Italian friend, who you guys seemed to   LOVE,  by the way!&nbsp; (He  is  single...) &nbsp; Then we each went back to "work", which&nbsp;really meant that&nbsp;we just goofed off on email until lunchtime&nbsp;(you have to keep up appearances, you know...).&nbsp; We had an awesome lunch at the chow hall together with a bunch of our other friends--that may sound strange because, after all, it is chow hall food, but we laughed our asses off at the most ridiculous things and I had tears pouring out of my eyes--seriously, I thought I was going to split my sides open!&nbsp; After lunch, I went over to Casa de Italiano (I'm not really sure if that is Italian or Spanish there...hmm...) where Rob works, and we played a rousing game of Shoot 'Em Up Max Payne on Play Station for about an hour, followed by two episodes of South Park ( Gotdammit!! ).&nbsp; When I felt sufficiently lazy and unproductive, I went back to my office for about a while to f#$& off some more.&nbsp; Heh, heh...even though I don't get Sundays off, it's kind of like, you know, I   do  .&nbsp; I hung around the office long enough to convince my boss that I am working  very  hard, during which time&nbsp;I was&nbsp;(of course) dorking around on&nbsp;email with Rob.&nbsp; (Do you know how  hard &nbsp; it is to play Battleship over EMAIL?&nbsp; Really, it should be a specialty in the&nbsp;Army.)&nbsp; So I&nbsp;got the hell out of there to continue the day's wanton disregard for work, rules, and authority.&nbsp; (Hey, it was SUNDAY, man.&nbsp; Everybody screws off on SUNDAY!)   We went to play rugby, which was awesome, and thus, the title of this post.&nbsp; For those of you who have never played rugby, it is vaguely like American football, but a lot more brutal.&nbsp; People bleed regularly in any game of rugby, and when I was in college, I saw a girl's tibia come OUT OF HER SKIN during a rugby game.&nbsp; It was really gross.&nbsp; Anyways, there are 15 players per side in rugby, whereas in football, there are 11 players per side.&nbsp; The field, called a "pitch" is slightly bigger than a football field, and lots of other differences, too.&nbsp; But the best thing is the positions.&nbsp; I played the position called a "hooker", which still gives me the giggles thinking about it.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; We had so much fun, and it is super-exhausting.&nbsp; We always play Aussies versus The World (the Australian forces versus the rest of the Coalition forces) and we (coalition)   never   win, but we always have fun, so that is what counts, right?&nbsp;  Hell, no, it isn't!&nbsp; I want to win, dammit! &nbsp; Anyways, we decided to switch it up a bit, so Rob and I ended up on a team that actually kicked ass. Our other friend, Nick, ended up on the other side, so we got to rub his nose in his sad, pathetic loss for the rest of the night.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; (Hell, yeah!&nbsp; That's what I'm talkin' about!)&nbsp; By the time we finished, I was soooooo tired, and I had a sprained ankle, I took an elbow to the&nbsp;collar bone,&nbsp;and I had a couple of jammed fingers.&nbsp; Rob skinned his&nbsp;knee, took a shoulder to the throat,&nbsp;and took a couple pretty good hits, but he scored his first "try" (kind of like a touchdown...worth   five points, baby  !) so it was worth it.&nbsp; I actually got an assist on that one, so it was a joint effort there...we  rocked .&nbsp; We were beaten, bruised, and bleeding, but we    f$%ng     ROCKED  .&nbsp;&nbsp;(Wounds heal--glory&nbsp;is forever.)   After we finished playing, we went to the Aussie pool (Yes, a pool you can swim in...in the desert.&nbsp; It was awesome.)&nbsp; We hung out there until we pruned up, then went back to Casa de Italiano for late-night movies (Kill Bill and The Boondock Saints)&nbsp;and pasta (rigatoni with tuna, sausage, and marinara sauce).&nbsp; Ohhhhhh...(drooling)...soooo good...I love Italians and their food...   Except for the occasional mortar fire, rockets, and, you know, that whole "possibility of death" thing, it was&nbsp;almost like being on vacation.&nbsp;   It was the greatest day!

      Hey everyone!&nbsp; I'm sorry I've been out of the loop lately...things have been really busy here and I just haven't had time to log on and post.  I can't stay--I'm just stopping in to say hi and to let you know that I'm still alive and I'll post&nbsp;more lately, when things settle down a bit.  :-)

      On a daily basis, I work with any given number of coalition soldiers from all over the place: Poland, Korea, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Italy, Kazakstan, and Georgia (the country, not the state!) to name a few.&nbsp;  &nbsp; In a coalition environment, sometimes it is interesting the situations one can get oneself into--a couple of days ago, a friend of mine was trying to describe a girl he knows and said  "she has a fence in her mouth" .&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; What the hell are you talking about, crazy man?&nbsp; Ohhhhhh...she has  braces .&nbsp; (See what I mean?&nbsp; In America, people  pay  for that kind of entertainment!) &nbsp; Anyways, there is this guy named Rob that I am pretty good friends with--I've known him for about four months now.&nbsp; He is Italian, and the aide for a one-star Italian general over here.&nbsp; He has spent quite a bit of time in America, so his English is very good, but he still has this great Italian accent that makes you just want to   squeeze   him!&nbsp; I love hanging out with him--he has the&nbsp;greatest outlook on life, and&nbsp;even though he has had some tough times, he just finds the good in every situation and continues on with his life&nbsp;in this cheerful (but not annoyingly happy) way.&nbsp; He just makes me laugh at everything, and we have so much fun together.&nbsp; When I was down in the dumps the other day, he cheered me right up.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he had me laughing so hard that I couldn't type, so I had to wait a little bit before I wrote this all down. &nbsp;  Rob:  Erin, my little&nbsp;flower, what is wrong?  Me:  Oh, nothing...I'm just thinking about something.  Rob:  Well do you want to tell me about it?  Me:  Nahhh...I'll just&nbsp;pout&nbsp;by myself. I don't want you to worry, too.  Rob:  Why do you worry? Here is my philosophy on life:   don't worry  .  Me:  Don't worry? That is easy for you to say! You don't have a care in the world!  Rob:  That is because I don't worry! I just drink wine and eat pasta and love life and have fun and go on vacation. Here is what I mean. If there is a situation&nbsp;you that you can do something about, then don't worry and just make a change for the better. If you cannot control it, then don't worry, because it is out of your hands!  Me:  Hmmm...okay!&nbsp; I'll try that!  Rob:  Very good. Now, do you want some pasta?  Me:  Umm, sure.&nbsp; But I'd rather be on vacation! &nbsp; How can you not love a guy like that? It was something like 3am for you guys, so I hadn't received any comments on my post yet, but&nbsp;he cheered me up right away.&nbsp; What a great friend, huh?&nbsp; And you guys get extra points for just being awesome  all the time!

      I. Am. So. Tired.  I didn't know it was physically possible to be this exhausted. This morning, I fell asleep while talking to my boss. He laughed at me and I felt really embarrassed, but seriously, how fucked up is that?  I haven't been sleeping at all because I've been having these horrible nightmares when I go to sleep at night. They all center around people I'm close to getting hurt: CP getting shot down while flying a mission (he flies Blackhawks) or my soldiers--who I am responsible for--dying while we are out on patrol, or us being attacked and having my body shredded by mortar shrapnel--I mean, really gory, gross stuff.  I guess it stems from the attack we had the other day, (which I didn't tell you guys about because a dear friend of mine was seriously injured and I'm not sure he is going to make it, and I just didn't want to talk about it) but this type of thing has happened before and its never bothered me this much.  Most days it is easy to just sit here in my office and watch the news and be distanced from it. But occasionally, after being out on a mission, something really hits hard in my heart and that's when I just want to go home and crawl into bed and hide from all the ugliness in the world.  You guys are so lucky to be surrounded by people you love. Don't EVER let go.

      I consider myself to be a pretty smart gal. I can set the timer on my VCR  by myself , I've been known to wear  and use  Night Vision Goggles, and I can operate a computer with little to no difficulty.  But if there is one kind of electronic thingy that I hate more than anything in the world, it is a Proxima. You know what I'm talking about...that little satanic machine you hook up to your laptop with 8,000 cords so you can project your computer screen's image on the wall? Pure evil. I can't figure the damn things out! This morning, it took me 25 minutes--  25 minutes!!!  --to get it up and running. Good thing I wasn't on a tight schedule, huh? I had blocked off my entire morning, just for this little adventure.  Usually, whenever faced with a bunch of cords, I just plug them all into whatever socket they fit into and push buttons until the damn thing does what I want it to. I know they come with instruction manuals, and the one I was working with this morning came with about 9 of them, all in different languages (Turkish, anyone?) but I never read them. Nooooooooo. That's like admitting defeat!  "I'm such a retard, that I need a little paper booklet to tell me how to operate this thing."  Fuck  that . I'd rather figure it out myself. Yes, I am   that   Type A.  So, long story short, I conquered the Proxima (yesssssss!) and briefed my boss with no technical difficulties. In the past, I've had floods, fires, small-scale earthquakes, and invasions by locusts interrupt my briefings, but this one went off without a hitch.  AND my boss complimented me on a well-thought out and flawlessly executed (he  actually  used those words) presentation. So woo-hoo for me!  The only down side of the whole situation is that now I've set a precedent, so he expects that type of high-quality technical genius for my next briefing.  Damn.

      Sorry I did not write yesterday--things got a little crazy over here for a little while and I was sidetracked with a mission until almost 2am. Everyone is fine, don't worry, and for those of you who have loved ones over here, don't worry--there was actually not a single shot fired!  I didn't write yesterday morning because I thought I would have time to write in the evening, and, well, that didn't happen! Okay, okay--I'm a slacker, too.  But I promise I'll come up with something good for later today. :-)

      In the Army we have weather guys. They are called SWOs, or Staff Weather Officers. Every day, when I get into work, part of my morning update is the SWO's daily brief, which includes things like percentage humidity, wind knots, high and low temperatures, and when the sun and moon rise and set. It may not seem like it, but this information is actually very important. If we know when the sun is going to rise and set, we will know when the enemy is most likely to attack, because those are the times of day when visibility is lowest, thus, the time of day when we are most vulnerable. (Okay, I'm a geek. Sorry.)  ANYways, we've had the same forecast (H-O-T) for about the past month and a half now. In the morning update, though, I always get such a kick out of what the SWO comes up with. How many different ways can you say "hot"? Here are a few gems from this past week:   Last Wednesday:  "Heat likely, with low visibility due to debris in the air." ( Translation: It is going to be hot, and there will be a sandstorm, so you won't be able to see SHIT.)    Last Thursday:  "High winds with brilliant sunlight."  (For real? Brilliant? As in, scholarship to Harvard? Congratulations!)    Last Friday:  "Hot with minimal chance of rain."  (Uh...duh. We're in the desert, dude.)    Last Saturday:  "Slightly shady with clear skies and sunlight."  (Which means: zero clouds, therefore, direct frickin' sunlight burning holes into my retinas.)    Yesterday:  "Hot with a slight chance of wind."  (Yeah, right. Wind that feels like a blazing fireplace.)    Today:  "High heat with scattered winds."  (What the fuck are "scattered winds"?)   I just thought it was part of my duty to point out the blatantly stupid. Plus, I figured you guys would get a kick out of it.  (Hee hee.)  I know I did!

      For those of you who read yesterday's post about the dumbass guy who electrocuted himself, here is a little something I wanted to add.  Mir, over at  urlLink Woulda Coulda Shoulda  wanted to know what this genius was so intent on plugging in that he wouldn't listen to reason.  Was it a life-saving cardiac arrest kit? Was it mission-critical equipment? Was it something used to thwart the enemy's evil and diabolical plans? What in the hell was it?!!  It was a lamp, folks. That's right--a lamp. An ordinary, boring, garden variety LAMP. Sorry to disappoint you, but I kinda think that the fact that it was just some lamp makes the story even funnier. I mean, can you imagine what must have been going through his mind?   "Oh, no! The enemy is getting closer! I think they've determined our exact location! All of us will surely die if I cannot come up with a brilliant plan! What on earth can I do??!! Come on, think, think, think...I know!! I'll plug in this lamp! Then we'll all be saved!"   Duh.

      I saw someone doing something stupid and a little bit dangerous today. One of my soldiers was completely determined to fit an American plug into an Iraqi outlet. 110 Volt plug into a 220 Volt socket? Yeah...not so smart.   At first, I wanted to jump in and say "Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are ya doin' there, buddy? You're gonna hurt yourself!"   But then I thought  "By God, Darwin was right! The weak and stupid really DO weed themselves out!"  So rather than interrupting this fascinating escapade of stupidity, I let him continue.   Yes, he hurt himself.   It was only minor, so yes, I laughed.   So in a way, I helped this guy, right? I mean, he knows not to do  that  again!

      I hate to use my blog as a place to voice my political views, and I promise to keep the bitching to a minimum, but please allow me to indulge myself in this just a little bit. I promise I'll try to keep it short and sweet.  (Gets on soapbox.)  AHEM.  People. We are Americans. We are the wealthiest and most prosperous nation in the world. Other nations have been around for 10 times longer than us, and yet, at only 228 years old, the USA is the most powerful country in the world.  Do you think that is a mistake? I will tell you, it is most certainly not! We have a system of government that WORKS. We elect a leader to represent us, and he chooses people to surround him who are the smartest and most knowledgeable on every subject imaginable. They may not be politicians, but they advise the man who is, and I can't help but think that our president, whoever he may be, truly wants to do the right thing.  In short, it pisses me off when people--Americans--bash my president. Yeah, that's right. MY president. Because I am a citizen, and I voted, and that means that I count. If you don't vote, you have NO RIGHT to complain. I'm here, in this inferno of a hellish craphole country, and if I can figure out how to fill out an absentee ballot with bullets flying over my head and mortars whizzing by, than surely, everyone else, with their couches, and their TVs, and their microwave dinners and peace and quiet that  I'm fighting for  can figure it out, too.  Okay. I am a Southern belle, Catholic, a Republican, a conservative, and in the military. It is no surprise, then, that I support President Bush. I think he has done an OUTSTANDING job pulling this nation together after 9/11, and even though it sucks to be over here, I think he is doing the right thing by keeping troops here to take care of this mess. He has chosen the harder right over the easier wrong, and that takes a certain kind of courage, fortitude, and integrity that few people have.  I did not vote for Clinton. When he was my president, (yes, MY president) I respected his decisions, even if I did not agree with them, because I knew that he had a whole cabinet of people who advised him. And even though I didn't agree with a lot of what he said, or with a lot of the decisions he made, the fact remains that bashing him would have done no good. Debate is wonderful--our country has progressed so far because of it. But the President of the United States of America deserves a certain respect because of his status, regardless of how I feel about his political views.  So all you Bush-bashers out there, listen up, because you are pissing me off. Stop it. Bush is doing a great job, and has some of the most intelligent people advising him. Condoleeza Rice is amazing. Colin Powell is remarkable. Donald Rumsfeld is spectacular--I've actually met him three times over here so far, and I would trust no one else to be in his position. Why do you think Bush picked these people to serve with him? Because they are the best, and he is smart enough to see that.  Leave my president alone. Come election time, I plan on voting for Bush again, but if Kerry wins, leave him alone, too. As Americans, our voice counts when we vote, but after that, cut out all the schoolyard bullshit and support your country, and please  please  support the troops. Debate is fine, and actually, I quite enjoy it, but give the President the respect he deserves.  (Gets off soapbox.)  Wheww! Okay, I'm done now. Thanks for indulging me! And if I haven't lost all of my readers, I promise I'll post something a little lighter next time. :-)

      Come on, admit it. You know what I'm talking about. You're out at a bar, enjoying a "few" drinks, when across the room, you see one of the most gorgeous men alive. He has dazzling green eyes, a casual and sexy smile, broad shoulders, and he is looking right at you. You smile and give sort of a wave. Just as you are about to wave him over, your Wingman (the female friend you came with) grabs your arm and spins you around.  "Dude?!! What the fuck are you thinking? Woof!"  Huh? What do you mean? He seems perfectly wonderful! (Shaking my head.) Tsk, tsk, tsk. You've just fallen victim to one of the most tragic phenomena the dating world has ever seen. Something that has helped ugly people all over the world succeed for thousands of years at the Horizontal Mambo: Beer Goggles.  Admittedly, I have occasionally worn the goggles in bars, but it has never progressed past pointing at someone I thought was Brad Pitt and having my Wingman go "Erin, seriously? Sweetie, maybe it's time to put  down  the vodka." That's because I always,  always  have someone with me who can: a)drive us safely home, b)keep me from making an ass of myself (hey,  not  an easy task), and c)protect me from Beer Goggles. Double points if it's all the same person. As my relationship progressed with CP and I realized he was The One, I stopped wearing the goggles. I lent them to friends and took up the dutiful job of being someone else's Wingman.  I haven't had a drink in over six months (due to necessity, not choice) but my skills as a Wingman are as sharp as ever. No one brought their Beer Goggles over here (they were notably left  off  the packing list), but after approximately 3 weeks in this country, everyone is issued Deployment Goggles. Now, I may have to explain this a little bit, but stick with me here.  It has been proven as a scientific fact that the longer someone is away on a deployment, the lower their standards for sexual conquest become. Allow us to delve into the extraordinary psychology of Deployment Goggles:  I'm sitting at lunch today (after battling the blazing heat to get to the chow hall) with three of the people from my office. (Hey misery loves company, right?) Take note that they are all male, and I am the lone female. So we're sitting with our backs to the wall, which allows for convenient people-watching, which is our normal lunch-time activity. Some female soldier walks by, and all three of them have stopped eating, jaws are dropped, eyeballs popping out, and they are all panting. She passes by, they all pick up their jaws, and then commence talking about how hot this chick was. "Seriously, man...she  wants  me. I could tell." "No, man...she wants  me ." "No way--you're second place, on this one, bro." By this point, I'm about to fall out of my chair, snort salad through my nose, and pee my pants because this "gorgeous chick" is just about the most atrocious-looking individual I have ever seen. (Hey, that's probably a little harsh, but I'm sure she has a  great  personality.) I have to fulfill my duties as a Wingman, though, so I pull myself together and manage to squeeze out "Guys, seriously, she is horrible. Take  off  the Deployment Goggles and put them back in your ruck sack." Then, I pull out a picture of Jennifer Aniston, which I keep just for this type of situation. "See? Jennifer GOOD. Ugly girl BAD." They all scratch their heads for a minute. Then a light bulb seems to come on and they nod up and down like cavemen. "Ugga ugga."   Wheww! Another crisis averted.  My work here is done.

      Even though I have quite the fiery Irish little temper and I am often prone to throwing things when angered, it actually takes quite a bit to make me mad. When I was in high school and in college, I worked as both a waitress and a bank teller and I discovered that there are two things in this world that most people do not take lightly: their food and their money.  I'm not very picky about my food, and rarely will I raise a big stink if the dressing is  on  the salad, instead of  on the side , like I requested.   (Flo, you idiot!)     But I am picky about my money. I work very hard--about 90 hours a week--and when you are in the military, it's not like you get paid per hour. Nope. I get paid the same amount whether I work 100 hours a week or 10 hours a week. So that's encouraging, huh? Yeah, right. But, regardless of the fact that I am being grossly underpaid for the job I do, I still give it 100% each and every day. So last paycheck, when I discovered that I was being paid $0, of course, I flipped out. It started out as a harmless phone conversation with CP:   Him:  I love you so much pookie bear!  Me:  I love you too my little schnookums!  (And numerous other gag-worthy statements--hey, we are still newlyweds!)   Him:  Have you looked at your paycheck  (online)  yet?  Me:  No, why?  Him:  Ohhhhhhh, you're gonna be pissed!  Me:  Why? Why am I going to be pissed?  Him:  They deducted your entire paycheck.  (I can hear him flinching through the phone, waiting for the aftermath.)   Me:  WHAT THE F@$^%??? WHY IN THE HELL !#&&@%E!#%???  Needless to say, I was a little upset.  So, long story short, I went to the Finance Help Desk, otherwise known as the Unhelpful Desk. Turns out, someone with the same last name had a debt to repay, and I had accidentally acquired that debt.  In the amount of $28,500.  (Okay, pick up your jaws now. Good.) When they discovered the error, you know what the guy said to me?    "Oops. My bad.  " Oops? No, no, no sweetheart. Oops is when you spill your beer. Oops is when you forget your dentist appointment. Oops is not $28,500.  Supposedly, he cancelled the debt and would reimburse my paycheck on the next one.  Supposedly.   Last night's conversation with CP:  Him:  Honey, now don't get mad, but--  Me:  But what? What's wrong? What happened? What's going on?  Him:  I love you so much, sweetie.  Me:  I love you too but you are pissing me off. What's wrong?  Him:  Well, your pay is not exactly... there .  Me:  Huh? What do you mean?  Him:  Well, you got stiffed again. $0.  (Flinching, and preparing for Armageddon.)   Me:  HOLY A^@$^@#%! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! @#%&$%&!!!  Now, I'm a reasonable woman, but understandably, I was pissed. And CP couldn't handle the issue because it was an error with my account, not to mention the fact that he is at another camp. So, today, I marched my ass right into Finance to visit the Unhelpful Desk, prepared to whip these shit-for-brains dumbasses into shape. (Can you believe they let me carry a gun?) I was prepared to lay the smack down when the nicest, sweetest, most helpful young soldier appeared in front of me, apologized for the error, corrected it in the computer, and assured me that it would be fixed come next paycheck. If it wasn't, I was supposed to please call her right away so that she could look into it personally.   Wow.    She didn't solve the problem of our banking woes right away, but as CP says, "At least we're both deployed and don't need that money for car payments, or mortgage, or anything!" True, but the fact that they could screw something this easy up--not once, but twice--lends new and interesting credibility to the Army Finance system.   I can't decide if I'm still mad or not.

      The following is a short list of some of the things I have really missed about the good ol' U.S. of A. since I came to the country otherwise known as The Surface of the Sun. No wonder everyone is immigrating to the US. We've got it all figured out.   1.Cherry Limeade  You know, the ones from Sonic? Mmmmmm...so good. I haven't had one since before I left, and I've been craving one for about 5 1/2 months now. Do you know what it is like to crave something for 5 1/2 months?   2.Pedicures  Aaaahhhhh...the guilty pleasure of letting someone  else  do the work for a change. I'm all for any activity where the most difficult decision I have to make is what color to put on my toes. Now for the sad part: even though I've only been deployed for 6 months, I haven't had a pedicure in about 8 months. I didn't want to get one right before deploying because then my feet would be all soft and non-callused. Maybe that sounds silly, but I wear boots  every single day , and without calluses in the right spots to protect my little tootsies, I'd be a mess. But when I get back? Whoa, baby! Watch out! I'm going to get a pedicure   at least   every week! And I will not wear boots--I will wear sandals and high heels and maybe I'll even go barefoot.   3.Shopping  I think this one pretty much speaks for itself, but allow me to elaborate. I love to shop--much to my husband's chagrin. I love to shop for me, for him, for friends, for family--anyone. To be honest, I don't really do it very often. So when I do, I feel perfectly justified. I love the thrill of finding a good sale, even when I know that actually making the purchase will inevitably entail explaining to my husband how I can save us money by buying crap. (He just doesn't get it.) I've already warned him that when I return, I plan on going on a MAJOR shopping spree. He just smiled and shook his head. "I love you." he said, which actually means "why do you need more shoes?"   4.Milk  I'm not really much of a milk drinker. Unless it is ice cold, with a big chocolate chip cookie, straight from the oven. I drink it because it is good for my bones and all that other stuff, but really, I'm not that big on it.  Until I came here.  We don't really have milk here...we have something that  resembles  milk.  Filk.  (Fake milk.) Filk is made from water (big shocker, there, I know), some random additives and preservatives, and dried goat's milk. It comes from some Kuwaiti farmer named Akhmed (not really) and has an unrefrigerated shelf life of about 8 billion years (really). Mmmm...tasty. In about 6 months, if you go to your local grocery store and they say "sorry, we're all out!" you'll know why. I drank it  all .   5.Cable  I am so far behind the power curve I don't know what to do. I still don't know what happened in the final episode of Friends. And I don't know if Carrie from Sex and the City chose that one guy over that other guy. I don't know which season of Survivor we're on, or what the Nip/Tuck guys are up to, or even who the newest VJ's are on MTV. At this point, I'd give anything for a commercial. I think I could even rejoice at one of those cheesy locally made used-car commercials right now.   6.Green Grass  To you, this might be redundant.  Green grass? Isn't that like a tall skyscraper?  But to me, it is most certainly not. Over here we don't have  green  grass, we have  brown  grass. Green grass is what you get when you live in an area that has:  a)sunlight (check)  b)sown grass seeds (check)  c)fertile soil (damn the desert!)  and d)water (damn the desert again!)  So, you see, that is why this country has grass that is burnt, scratchy, and brown.   7.Weekends  I can  barely  remember what weekends are. I work from 7:30 am until about 9 pm every day. I do not get weekends off, although I do take about an hour for church on Sundays. Long gone are the days when I lounge around in my PJ's all day. Maybe I'll do the laundry, or maybe not. Maybe I'll dust the furniture, or maybe not. Maybe I'll drive to Target, or wash the car, or get the dog clipped, or go to the movies.  Or maybe not. (You see? In America, the Land of Opportunity, the possibilities are endless.)   8.Alcohol  In college, I was quite the party animal. Friends of mine can attest to the time I took my Physics final drunk because the night before was this phenomenal party at our sorority house. (I got an 'A'.) They can also attest to the fact that I can name over 100 beers  just by the taste . (By the way, my friends, this is no small feat--it takes discipline, hard work, and an extreme tolerance for alcohol.) But after college, those days were over. I graduated to a new level of drinking--the Have a Beer When You Get Home From Work and Then Pass Out Exhausted level. Occasionally, there were BBQs on the weekends, and sometimes debauchery with the friends hosted by me and CP, but mostly, I just enjoyed a drink after getting home from work and then  maybe  had another with CP at dinner. It was relaxing...a nice way to unwind after a hard day. I miss that.   9.Delivered Food  America has it all figured out. Too tired to cook? To lazy to get in the car to drive to a restaurant? No problem! We'll deliver right to your door! Pizza? Egg rolls? Chicken wings? Moo-goo gai pan? Garlic bread with dipping sauce? Comin' right atcha!   10.US Postal Service  I wish if I mailed something, it would get there in three days or less. Shit, I wish if I mailed something it got there  at all ! Sometimes, letters get here weeks or months after they are mailed, and sometimes not at all. I ordered something from Amazon last month? Yeah. It got here  today . The military postal system is so finicky...I long for FedEx...I  dream  about UPS. (What can brown do for  you , baby?) Even when I mail a letter or a card to my husband, who is at another camp about 15 minutes away, it takes almost a week to get to him. If we were home in America, I wouldn't have even  mailed  the damn thing. I would have driven over to him, plopped it in his lap, and called it a day.   Aaaahhhh...the simple joys in life.   So, the moral of the story is:  appreciate what you have . Or, the more popular one lately,   learn to bitch about it  .

      Every day when I leave my nice, sometimes air-conditioned office for lunch, I am amazed at how much hotter this place gets every day. I do not work close to the chow hall, mind you, so it is not just a hop, skip, OR a jump to grab a bite to eat. And no one   grabs a bite to eat   over here. Ooooohhhhhhh no. It's way too hot. When you finally get to the chow hall, after braving the gut-wrenching heat, all you want to do is collapse on the steps and pull on the ankle of the person next to you, begging " Water! Please! I will die if you don't give me water! "   K, one of my soldiers, commented today that “it’s like they pipe in hot air from hell!”  Seriously.  This. Place. Is. HOT.   This morning it was 109 degrees at 11:30 a.m. and the high for today was 124 degrees.   Even though this region of the world is supposedly The Cradle of Civilization, it doesn't surprise me that we spread all over the world.   Everyone was trying to get away from here.    It is so hot that you don’t even want to do anything…I don’t want to eat because it makes me feel like I’m going to vomit. In fact, I don’t even eat dinner anymore because going outside for lunch is enough torture for me that I don’t want to go outside a second time for a meal if I don’t have to. I don’t want to exercise, because it is so hot that I  would  vomit. I don’t want to work, I don’t want to go to the PX, and I certainly can’t sleep. (Mostly because I’m supposed to be working, but lately, I haven’t been doing much of that, either.)   Today, the wind was really kicking, and as you well know, over here, that means you are standing in front of a hairdryer. On high. Well, with the wind comes the sand.  Of course, I’m retarded and for some reason didn’t have my sunglasses, so it was getting all in my eyes.  And my hair, and my nose, and my mouth, and my ears, which was making me irritable, of course.   But it isn’t just the heat. It’s the  sweat . I guess it’s good I’m sweating because it means I’m drinking enough water, but as soon as I step outside these air-conditioned walls, the sweat starts to pour out of my body. It gets on and IN everything. It pours into my eyes, stinging them and temporarily blinding me. It makes my uniform stick to my body—and not in the sexy way. In the  annoying  way, where your pants ride up your butt crack and there isn't really much you can do to correct it without looking like a retard in front of your soldiers. All vanity aside, I fixed it anyways. They made fun of me. I made fun of them. We bonded.   It gets into my clothes and stays in there, so that there is almost no way I can wear one uniform for more than a day or so without spraying the hell out of it with Febreze. I keep telling myself that it can’t possibly get any hotter, that this is the armpit of the earth, the surface of the sun, the fiery inferno of hell. But each day, God smiles down upon me and makes it even hotter than the previous day.  Almost like He is laughing at me.  Yeah, funny.  I'm halfway through with this deployment! You think a little heat is going to dampen my spirits?  Bring it on.

      CP and I had a great “conversation” last night.  (I call it that because we were on Instant Messenger, which kind of stinks, but at least we get to communicate.)  We talked about having kids and when is the right time and everything.  He wants to have kids now.  No, seriously  NOW .  He is so ready to be a father.  I am so ready to be a mother, but I also know that I want some time for us to be together before we have kids.  Now, even though I'm only 25, and therefore still in the "young" category, I also know that CP and I want to have a big family, and I don't want to be in my 40's when I finish cranking 'em out.  Soooooooo, I think what we will do is this: when I get back to the states, I’ll outprocess the Army and start a new job.  I’ll settle in to my new job and build up a good relationship with my new boss.  After CP gets back from his deployment (next March-April timeframe), we will have a couple months together before we take a second honeymoon to Bermuda around June (our 2nd anniversary) and try for a baby there.  Woo-hoo!  Hopefully, I’ll get pregnant right away, which will mean that we’ll have a baby in March ’06.  Wow, that sounds really weird to say!  It is even weirder to think about me being pregnant!  But so exciting!  We thought about getting pregnant right before I leave here, because then I’d have the baby in October ’05.  But I don’t think that is the right decision because I’d be all pukey and vomiting while I’m starting a brand-new job, not to mention the fact that I’d have to ask for maternity leave right away, and that isn’t really fair to whoever I end up working for.  Plus, I want CP to go through the pregnancy with me.  And I’m going to have enough to deal with when I get back without thinking about being pregnant.  You know, new house, new car, new job, Bailey’s (the dog, who is temporarily with my parents) readjustment...    My mom, who is completely wonderful, asked me to just take some time off, finish my Master's and have a baby after I leave the Army.  "Why do you need to work?"  She asks.  Well, dear darling mother, I want to go back to work because I am   way   too much like YOU.  You see, my mother is a very success-driven woman.  She has a PhD in Nursing and teaches at a college in my hometown.  She also has students come to her house and she teaches them there, as well.  AND she fills in at the local hospital whenever they need her.  And  ohbytheway , she takes care of three dogs (including my Bailey-boy) and my 15 year-old sister.  My dad works away 5 days a week and is home on weekends, so she handles all of that day-to-day stuff by herself, usually.  She is unbelievable.    Somewhere along the way, I've picked up on some of her habits--like the need for knowledge, and the need to make a significant contribution to the family finances.  Admittedly, part of this last need stems from the fact that if I want to buy some ridiculously expensive pair of shoes, I wouldn't want to have to ask my husband for the money.  Lord knows what he would say...the same thing every man says when a wife talks about shoes:  "Don't you have enough of those?"    Anyways, the bottom line for me is that  I want it all .  The husband, the kids, the successful career, the stable finances...all of it.  I want it--and I know it can be done.  Although I truly believe that a child should be with their parents or a close family member for the first year or two of their life, I do not believe that just because I want children I have to stop everything  else  I want to do in life.  So I won't.  I'll pause for a little bit, but before you know it, I'll be up and running again.  I am so excited to start the rest of my life with CP.  It seems like we have been held back for a very long time because of everything in our lives…we must be the strongest/toughest couple alive!  Who else could survive a five year long distance relationship, then finally get married but never see each other, followed immediately by a deployment?  I guess I’m either completely in love with him, or else totally insane.  I think I’m in love, though.  I’m generally a very sane person. :-)

      I hate to say it, but being over here has been a good thing for me and CP (my husband, Cutie-Pie). When we were back home, we spent so much time apart (5 years of long-distance dating, followed by finally getting married, then I went to Korea, he went to the National Training Center, I went to Jordan, he went to the Joint Readiness Training Center…) that I don’t think I really appreciated him.  I kind of took him for granted because we were never around each other, and I am pretty independent, so I've always been dependent on myself.  Now, everything is so different.  I still love him the same, if not more, as before, but I really think that being over here has made me realize how lucky I am to be with someone who loves me so much and treats me the way I deserve to be treated.  I have seen soldiers who are just ripped in half because of their cheating spouses back home, and it pains me to see what they have to go through.  I’ve also seen tons of hook-ups over here that aren’t exactly ethical, and that bothers me.  Why would you marry someone if you weren’t planning on being with ONLY that person?  Being here has allowed me to see all kinds of people and how they react to different situations under different circumstances.  I wear a wedding band and a big sparkly diamond  every day , and that doesn’t stop guys from hitting on me.  Seriously?  You've got to be kidding me!  No, I will  not   make out  with you!  On some level, a teeny tiny part of me is a little flattered, because even in uniform, in 122 degree heat, with sweat pouring off me and sand stuck to me, it's nice to know I've still got it.  But I'm also annoyed that someone would behave so completely inappropriately when it is obvious that I am not interested, nor am I available.  Geez.  I am so glad that I have someone who would never disrespect me by doing any such thing.    Also, prior to deploying, I really wasn’t comfortable with having children—I am very young and CP and I just recently got married, so I really wanted to wait, to make sure we had a solid foundation before we threw someone else into the mix.  CP said he thought we were great and wanted to start a family right away.  I have a little more pull on that one, though... okay, honey, I'm going to play this ovary card one more time!   Also, quite honestly, I just didn’t think I was at a point where I was ready to be a mother.  I told CP we would try for kiddos once we got back, but to be honest, I said it only to pacify him.  At the time, I didn't really mean it.  Kind of mean, I know...but I just hated seeing him disappointed, and his eyes lit right up when I suggested that.  Now, I can't wait to get done with this deployment so we can start our family.  Being over here and seeing so much death and ugliness and destruction of life has triggered something in me.  I can't wait to give life to something innocent and beautiful.  When I told CP this, he was completely overjoyed.  "Let's make babies NOW!" he said.  "Well, sweetie," I said. "that's a little difficult right now...you know, that whole war thing?"  But we're really looking forward to being parents.  I think we'll be pretty good ones.  As far as the cheating husbands over here (there could be cheating wives, too, but they don't approach me, thank goodness!), all I can do is be professional and tell them, no, thank you, and ohbytheway, don't you have a wife and three kids back home you  dirtbag ??!!  Then, in a very calm and gentle voice, I tell them that they should talk to a chaplain about the trouble they are having in their marriage.  Usually this scares them off.  (Hee hee!)  Just to clarify, I'm not a bitch--I just don't take kindly to those who can't value the sanctity of marriage.

      Being deployed here to Iraq has made me realize how lucky and proud I am to be an American.  Don't worry...I'm not going to break out into my own personal rendition of "God Bless the USA" or anything. (Although I'm secretly humming it to myself this very moment...)  I just wanted to include a few of the things I find...um... intriguing  about this country.  Being here has made me realize we've got it pretty good back home.  So here goes:   1.  EIW  Evil Iraqi Wind.  This is the kind of wind where you think it would be cooler because there is a breeze, but really, the “breeze” is like standing in front of a hair dryer.  In a sauna.  Wearing a snowsuit.    2. IAW  Iraqi Ass Flu.  Otherwise known as Saddam’s Revenge.  This is what happens when you catch food poisoning from the chow hall.  It is horrible—puking and crapping all day long.  And don’t try to tough it out, because you’ll just end up exhausted and dehydrated.  Just suck it up and go to the medic for an IV and some good old fashioned antibiotics.   3.  SIR  This is how Iraqis refer to me.  “Hello, Sir!”  Geez!  I’m a woman!  It doesn’t matter, though.  Middle Easterners—especially Iraqis—are not used to seeing a woman in a position of power, so there really is no word for “Ma’am”.  So they call me Sir.  Lucky me.   4.  LIGHTBULBS  The problem with light bulbs in this country is that they burn out very quickly.  I was at a loss as to why this happens until I witnessed Lightbulb Replacement Ops for myself.  Two Iraqis were coming around to each light fixture in the building where I work to replace light bulbs.  One of them carried a ladder, and the other carried a cardboard box with two holes poked in the sides and a cord shoved through the holes to make a handle.  He slings this cardboard box over his shoulder and skips around, banging it joyfully on walls and railings and things.  What, you might ask, could possibly be in this box?  Why, lightbulbs, of course!  See?  Now the mystery of why lightbulbs don’t last very long in this country has been solved.   5.  PAPERTOWELS  Virtually non-existant in this country.  At the chow hall, we wash our hands in the sinks outside, and instead of paper towels, they have these gigantic rolls of tissue that closely resemble toilet paper and are about the same thickness.  Ever tried drying your hands with toilet paper?  Yeah.  Maybe then you will have some idea of where I am coming from.   6.  PERSONAL SPACE  Like paper towels, the concept of personal space is non-existent in this country.  If you are speaking to an Iraqi, he will undoubtedly move closer and closer to you until he is within about one foot of your face.  If you move away, he will not get the hint.  He will only continue to move closer.  I’m not joking—for some reason, the people in this country are comfortable with that kind of proximity.  Throw in some body odor and some fermenting perfume and you’ve got yourself into a fairly interesting predicament.   7.  HOLDING HANDS  I think it is perfectly acceptable for males to hold hands.  But only if they are children under the age of 6 or one is the father and the other is his son.  Under NO circumstances is it okay for a man to interlace his fingers with another man’s, especially when these two men are grown.  In this country, however, holding hands is how men show their closeness and affection for one another.  Yeah, sure...closeness.   8.  CAMEL SPIDERS  If you wonder why they are called camel spiders, it’s because they are large enough to carry a sheik, his wives, and his entire tribe across the desert.  With luggage.  Seriously, these things are about a foot in diameter—maybe a little more.  And they chase you.  Well, they aren’t really chasing you so much as chasing your shadow.  You see, since Iraq is such a blistering inferno, camel spiders flock to any shade they can find—namely, the shadows of people.  And they move very quickly, too—up to 10mph—so it can be quite unnerving if you see one charging at you.  If you move, so does your shadow, so it will give chase until you stand still.   9.  SAND  Alright.  I'm all about some sand--as long as there is some water attached in the form of a beach.  But here in lovely Iraq, there is no water attached to this sand.  And in this country it is like some super grande strain of annoying sand.  It gets in EVERYTHING.  My eyes, my hair, my equipment, my weapon...sometimes, if the wind kicks up, I'll get sand in places I didn't know I could GET sand.  (Minds out of the gutter!  I'm talking about armpits, people,  armpits !)   10.  ARAB-SEEKING BULLETS  I swear on a stack of Bibles that this is true.  A Master Sergeant I know has the challenging job of teaching the new Iraqi Police how to fight, including how to fire a weapon.  He was showing them how to fire by using both hands.  One of the Iraqis said to him:  “We don’t shoot that way.  Only women fire with two hands.  Men can handle a weapon with one hand.”  “Yeah, no kidding,” said the Master Sergeant.  "How do you think America was able to kick your butts?"  “Well,” said the Iraqi, “it is a well known fact that America gets their bullets from Israel, and Israel is an enemy of Iraq.  For this reason, Israel produces Arab-seeking bullets.”  You've  got  to be kidding me.  Brilliant.  And that, my friends, is why I love America.

      AHA!  Okay, so it took me a little while, but I figured it out.  Pretty neat!  So I've figured out the most basic aspect of blogging...good for me, eh?  Now if I can just figure out that darn "100 Things" doo-hickey everyone seems to be doing...

      So after reading everyone else's blogs for about 6 weeks, I finally gave in to the sinful pleasure of  having my own blog .  (Imagine a loud, booming voice there...)  After finding blogspot.com online to help me build my little piece of the word, I finally decided to go ahead and post.  How hard can it be, right?  I wanted to see the template first, because as smart as I am I cannot figure out this computer stuff.  So I'm sending this out there into the computer world as a test.  Hopefully it works, but if it doesn't post correctly, oh well.  At least no one will know what a dork I am.

      You guys have all been soooooooo wonderful and supportive of me...thank you so much!  Your encouraging words are way too much--I'm not doing anything extraordinary, just my job as best as I can!  (Seriously, there are some who are a lot worse off than me!)  On another note, I've been the most horrible blog friend EVAH lately.  I've been trying to catch up on all my reading, but to no avail, as I have only been able to work half-days since the incident and I have to actually WORK during that time.  (Usually I blog and goof off in the wee hours, but these drugs have been shutting me down lately...which, actually, might be a good thing since I really need some rest.)  So where was I?  Oh, right...the slacker blog friend thingy.  Okay.   urlLink Zoot :  I'm all caught up on your happenings...I think I even posted a message the other day to your blog.  I took that 80's lyrics quiz, and I was a)baffled at how many I got right, and b)embarrassed by how many I got wrong.  I thought I was such a rock star, but apparently, I suck.  :-)   urlLink Rachel :  I made sure to catch up on your blog right away, because after all, you took care of me while I was gone, and that makes you AWEsome.  You kick ass, and if we ever meet in Normalville, I'll give you a high five and a huge hug.  :-)   urlLink Mir :  I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE reading your blog, but I'm not up to date on it, yet.  I'm so sorry.  I'll get right on that, though!   urlLink Hula Doula :  Thanks for being so sweet and supportive in your messages--you are the best!  Sadly, I'm not up to date on your blog yet, either.  Almost, though.  But "close" only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades, and atomic bombs, right?  (Sorry...the Army chick in me coming out again.)  I'll finish up today, I promise!   urlLink Michele :  I'm caught up with your blog.  You rock.  There just are no other words.  :-)  So I could go on, and list a message to each and every one of you, but my arm hurts (Yeah, I know...I know...Do you want some cheese with that whine?) so I'm going to sign off for now.  You guys are all  SWEEEEEEEEEEET  (imagine the Cartman voice there...) so thanks for being great friends.  In the future, I promise not to be such a slacker!  Love love love!!!

      Hey everyone!  I'm back!  This post is going to take me a long time to type, though, because I received a battle wound while I was out.    We were on our way back, though, so at least we accomplished the mission!  Don't worry, I'm okay (kind of) but I got hit in the upper arm by a bullet, on the part below my bicep.  I was VERY lucky.  (Luck of the Irish, right?)  ;-)    My driver took one in the leg and one in the body armor.  (Thank GOD for Kevlar and ceramic sapi plates!)  He is going to be fine, but he is still in the hospital.  They kept me in the hospital overnight, otherwise I would have been back yesterday.  Long story, but the end state is that I'm going to be fine, and that's all that matters.  CP freaked out, though, because the Army called up his unit and was like:   "Dude, your wife got shot.  She is in the hospital."    They didn't even tell him I was fine!  They let me call him when I got out of surgery, though, so he is better now.  Geez.  ANYways, I'm probably in a lot of pain, but I'm on  GOOOOOOD  drugs and can't feel anything, so I wouldn't know.  Or care.  :-)  So,  urlLink Rachel , you are the BEST.  Thank you for taking care of things while I was gone.  And yes, feel free to mess around with my site...I'm up for a new look if you have some free time and are completely bored.  :-)  And to the Iraqi bastard that shot at me, I say:      Pog mo thoin   Pog mo thoin - 'Kiss my ass.'You're one tough bastard, and if anyone doesn't like it, they can kiss your ass. You enjoy fighting and causing grievous bodily harm. Hey! What are you lookin' at, punk?   You better hide, muthafucka, 'cause I'm coming after you.   Okay, so I'm a little violent lately.  Sorry about that...I'm not normally like this, I swear!  You would be too, though, if you had the  sweeeeeeeet  meds I have.  I'm not allowed out to play for a couple days, though, so that stinks, but I'll be back in no time, just as strong as ever.  I missed you guys!  What has everyone been up to?

      Take the quiz:  urlLink "Which Random Irish Gaelic Phrase Are You? "      Ta me air meisce  Ta me air meisce - 'I am drunk.'You enjoy a drink - or five - now and then. You can usually be found in a pub - it doesn't matter which one, because they all look the same after a few drinks - or hugging the porcelain.  Erin should be back soon. You won't have to put up with me much longer. I thought a fitting quiz though. TAKE IT!   urlLink -rachel

      As previously mentioned by Erin my name is Rachel and I reside at  urlLink bitchalicious.com . I saw her problem with previously mentioned "asshat" and well offered my assistance. Since blogger does not have an IP ban I have removed Blogger comments and put in Haloscan comments.  What does this mean to you?  1. You do not have to sign in to comment.. (this is great for me!!!) 2. Once "asshat" comments again I'll merely snag her/it's IP address and ban her from commenting on Erin's page again.  I might even.. (since I am a  urlLink Web-Diva ).. if the mood hits me give Erin a bright new very Irish look. I'm a military wife. My husband serves with the United States Air Force and we're currently living in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm also a US Navy daughter and a US Army sister. The military has been in my life since the day I was born (and nine months and 6 days before to be exact)...   I have nothing but the utmost respect for Erin. I think that she is making the best out of a tough tough situation and is coming through with sparkling colors and stars and flyers!  I forgot to mention that my  urlLink husband  is a citizen of the United States.. he got his citizenship when he was 16 years old. Born and bred in goold ole Ireland.  So this has been a brief "about me" and a little explanation as to why the comment system has changed.  Also when Erin is back in the states and it's possible I'm giving her her own domain and blogging system so not only can she keep asshats from commenting but she can keep them from even LOOKING at her site... Love it love it love it!!!  And that is all for now. Enjoy!  Love Rachel.. even though it says Erin!

      Hey everyone!   Well, I am back from my 4-day trip up north...I know I didn't mention it to anyone, but I can't really talk about missions until they are over.  Hey, I have to have SOME secrets, you know!  :-)  I am going to be out of the loop again for a couple of days while I go out on another misison, but Rachel, from  urlLink bitchalicious  is going to be visiting, messing around with my blog, and maybe leaving a few posts.  (Yay!!)  So give her (and me!) some love while I'm gone, and stop by to say hi.  Oh!  I almost forgot.  Rachel is fixing things so that the Vicious Poster can't come back.  And that makes me happy.  :-)
