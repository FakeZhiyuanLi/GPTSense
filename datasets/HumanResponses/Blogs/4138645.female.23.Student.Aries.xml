          OOOOOOOOOOHH my goodness, just when i think i am going to catch up on my sleep, wow.  Last night was so crazy i don't even know where to begin!!  Well, I was supposed to go see Daisher sunday night, but I got to Cassies (to pick up the dig cam) too late, and he had to get up early, so I just chilled at home with Grandma and Uncle Dave, plus my cuz Sarah got in around ten from NY...and I haven't seen her in a long time.  So i stayed here and watched Inuyasha with the fam, i mean, Nooch, Ben, Nick, Sarah and Dave all watched it with me, including Keebler and my kittens!!  Monday morning, i slept till like ten o clock, i needed the rest i guess, I called Sonja, Johnny's little sister, cause we were scheduled to do a photo shoot today, she was on her way home from visiting Bobby in Cleveland, so i cleaned the house until she got here, I love photography, I could minor in it..sigh..well it was a fun shoot, nice day, she looked too cute in my cowboy hat, i hope the pictures get her somewhere, they are fantastic, maybe I'll link you guys to them if she doesn't care!  Well, she was here from like noon until 4:30 shootin and she had to go to work, well she got lost and was late, but PETE'S SAKE I didn't do it!!  I got showered and dressed, I was supposed  to meet Sara up at Flavors, it was her first night bartending, so i got dressed, and half way up there she calls and says i lost her soc, card when i unpacked the groceries yesterday, so i go to the house cause Brandi and Barry are there and had to dig thru the damn garbage...sooooooo gross, Barry was amused to say the lease, no luck, so I drive back to Cassies' and she follows me there and drops my car off and we go to Flavors.  We got a munchie tray cause we were starving!!  I got a free beer from Jessie...she's training Sara today, and I love her!  Well, Candace came, Kim Came, Timmy and Dave came, Jessie's boy and his friends came, Mike and his friend from the bar came, and some other kid he knows, Yoster came, and we basically had the bar to ourselves!!  We drank for freaking free all night long, i did so many shots, Cosmopolitans, Windex, Alligators, Hurricanes, beer all around, and others I have no clue what they were, we left at like 2:30, after i had made numerous phone calls to people i don't remember calling, and songs i don't remember playing, and taco bell i don't remember eating...oh goodness i was crazy, I called Daisher, and Cody, and woke up RJ when we got back to the house, and Dmiles let Kim sleep in his room, and i bombarded RJ and took over the bed, I know he's pissed, he had football today, i woke up and had NO idea where the hell i was, thank goodness i was with my boys!!!  Then i had to get up today at 8am, and went back to Sara's and Timmy ended up cuddling with her last night, ha ha, and candace was on the couch, and i didn't even get to go back to bed, I just went out and went shopping.  I got Dave Kill Bill 2 for his b day, i got one for me too.  Then i got Aqua Teen Hunger Force for myself...season 2 baby!!  watched all those movies today and just chilled on the computer all day messing with Sonja's pictures.  I did get SOME studying done today...I was glad, school starts monday, ah, sigh, no more freedom, buckle down time.  I talked to SAP for like a really really long time too, my sweetie....well, i am gonna make Daisher watch Evil Dead with me tonight, since everyone is still working, I am outtie like a troutie, ha ha so gay, later J

         So this past weekend my Schmiller Time and I went to Toledo because her folks live there, it was also her friend Jackie's birthday.  It started out a slow night, Schmiller was going shot for shot with Jackie, so she was feelin pretty good, I was still HURTING from the night before (where was I, hmm Paninis with Eve, Hollie, and Kim...oh yea that's where I met Mike this really nice kid that we are so gonna hang out with, anyways), i was not up to another marathon night, PLUS some jerk tried to steal money out of my credit card, so a new one is on the way, i hate people, so i was credit cardless for the weekend, aka. moneyless, I had checks, and bars don't take checks much to my dismay!! We went to this bar called Jake's and her friends were nice, I met some new friends too, Mike and Dave, they looked lonely at the bar, so we kept em company, well Jackie did, she was a hoot, WASTED!!  Well, we chilled there for a while, then Sara's other friends got there, Josh and Zachary...so we left and went to another bar, the Ale House, DEAD, so we hopped next door to Jax, which was semi-dead but better than nothing, I was falling asleep at the bar i was so freaking tired!!  At that point I was ready to drink anything, as long as it would wake me up.  We left there and went over to my little pumpkin Scott Haas' house, he lives in Toledo now, he's only 20 so house parties it is for two more months for Scottie, it was so nice to see Scottie, I missed him, his girlfriend was there, I met her, and she turned out to be from Jackson, WIERD!!  We drank some Keystone Light with them (ewie) and sara downed some Goldschlagger for shits and giggles, (barf) and we ended up going back to this kid's (craig's) house to crash, Scottie came over and watched cartoons with me for a little bit, it was ONLY 3am..ha ha, sara passed out, only after calling everyone in her phone book, and emailing everyone she knows, INCLUDING her professor from school, which should turn out wonderful!!  She didn't do two of her papers, so we gotta fib!!  OH well, we woke up at like ten o clock and went back to her parents house, her mom, o my gosh, made us this breakfast large enough for an army, french toast casserole, cheesy hash browns, watermelon, strawberries, canteloupe, ham, sausage, blueberry muffins, cheery cheesecake desserts, and Jello, stromboli, and all sorts of stuff to take home with us, they are just so funny with her, they send soooo much stuff home with her!  I got home sunday about 4, sara worked at 4:30, I cleaned up the stuff at the house, and came home.  I crashed when i got here, i was so tired, I think i did something else, I just can't remember!!  For now, that's all ya need to know though...hee hee, later gaters

         I got to see my wifey today for the first time in a long time, and might i say that she is still my sexy wife I married back in the tenth grade!!  I was thinking...if i hadnt' taken that first step and called her that fateful day, we might never have met, and had this wonderful relationship....but honestly I love my Cassie, and do miss her.  She's depressed right now, and I wish I could help, but my problems are different.  I think it's terrible that I can't find a decent guy (isnt' that the neverending problem), seriously, just when I think I find one, they turn out to be a-holes...the one i want moves all the time, so I never get to see him, I have one now, and I don't know where that is going to go, but I decided that I am going to take it easy, and just see what happens, I worry myself over things like that.  I saw one of the OLD ones at Fat Tuesday's last night with his girlfriend, that always makes you feel good, ESPECIALLY since (not to be conceited) I looked WAY better than she did, sigh, o well, I guess the nice girls are not supposed to find good guys, we're destined to date douche bags...Evie is upset, Cassie is depressed, Heather is struggling with herself at this particular moment, and my girls Candace and Sara are swimming in the single pool with me.  What is WRONG with us, I swear, If i knew that i'd be a millionaire.
