        Today as I sat on the bus, coming home from school, I witnessed a bunch of kids from year 9 or 10 acting like dickheads, and when I say that...I mean it in its rawest form. Throwing apples and all sorts around the bus. One apple had hit&nbsp;a girl&nbsp;and suprisingly the kid just sat down and acted like nothing had happened.&nbsp;This girl&nbsp;wasn't wanting to go up and get up these little crackheads so I decided I'd take it upon myself to make sure they apologised. Funny it seems when a person bigger then them approaches em, they're quick to kiss arse and make up.  &nbsp;  This really opened my eyes to how two-faced some people can be. The fact that people just plain don't give a fuck about anyone else these days really annoys me. For example; I'll hold a door open for a person, and they expect it. No thankyou's or cheers mate, they just expect it. The lack of consideration really gets me up in arms and people wonder why others get pissed because of it. I think Australia needs to take a look themselves and realise how fucking arrogant and rude they can be, because for the rest of us, you make this world a less enjoyable place.  &nbsp;  Quote of the day:    He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it - namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to obtain.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;- Mark Twain

        urlLink    Just recently, I have began to come to terms with my faith and religion. I believe a few months ago, I wouldnt have cared about it, though I'm only young I reckon its essential for me to have faith in something. I saw this picture and it reminded me of something that my grandad said to me. He said "Try to think about faith, think about it in the form of a tap, if you allow it, and turn the water on the amount of water coming out is totally up to you, that tap won't turn itself." That really opened my eyes. In this day and age I reckon a relgious identity is what I need..

        Track Listing:    &nbsp;   Crash  Broken  The Way I Feel  Open Your Eyes  Home   Fade Away  Back Up   Soulfire  In My Head  Running Out Of Pain  My Life  Erics Song   Track 1)  Crash opens the album with a grungey feel to it. Mixed with old school solo's this makes for an awesome track. Paul McCoy's vocals behind the guitars, personify the feeling of the song. The varying up and down and mix between melodic and intense combinations throws this song up there with the best on the album. &nbsp;  Track 2)  The second song to grace the self titled debut is, in my opinion, the best on the album. Has sort of a Drowning Pool crossed Our Lady Peace theme. The lyrics hold a deeper meaning then to what some may believe on the exterior, but listen closely. (Hint: Listen to the lyrics as if they're a prayer/letter to jesus) &nbsp;  Track 3)  The way I feel, to me, really examplifies experiences I have been through. Again the mix of heavy guitar work working in symphony with the slower more mellow tunes, really makes this song appealling. &nbsp;  Track 4)  Open your eyes takes a different spin. The single notes are replaced suddenly by palm mutes and hammer ons. The swift pick up and slow downfall of the mellody works not in the favour of the previous songs as they follow the same suit.   &nbsp;  Track 5)  The feedback at the begining gives the track a live feel, the chorus really sets this song on fire. At first glance this track seems a bit soft for me, but listening to it thoroughly, it picks up and drops off just as quickly. &nbsp;  Track 6)  I really like this song. The begining of the song really takes me, the lead and rhythm work together and mixed with an awesome beat and crazy vocals the lead in to the chorus is executed perfectly. I really relate to this song, listen to it, I gurantee any bloke who's been dumped will know what I mean. &nbsp;  Track 7)  The mild to heavy tune is carried through the whole song. Though&nbsp;I figure the highlight of this song is the solo at the end and the vocals, which remind me of David Braiman's vocals at the beginning of Down With The Sickness. (AWESOME SONG) &nbsp;  Track 8)  I love the riffs in this song, the mellow bit in the middle with the accentuation of the toms really works with the vocals. The heavy bit that lead into it aswell is harmonoius with the opening as is the finshing. &nbsp;  Track 9)  This song followed suit with the normal format of 12 Stones' songs, soft throughout the verse and the chorus absolutley blows you away. Again vocals are crazy and work well with the tune. &nbsp;  Track 10) &nbsp;This is a really soulful song in my eyes. The solo's really steal the lime light and are really evocative of how the song was written. The guitar work really personifies the feelings behind the song and, with powerfule lyrics you cant go wrong. &nbsp;  Track 11)  I reckon this song would really relate to teenagers. I know I do. It describes the feelings and boundaries instilled by parents and the effect they leave upon you. The phrase  "My Life"  I think describes the motive behind the writing and composure of this song. &nbsp;  Track 12)  Eric's Song really has a different feel to it, from interlude to chorus and note construction. Even the vocals seem different to match the theme. I am totally into the chorus and again the closing solo just takes the cake. &nbsp;  Final Verdict:  For a debut album, the boys have made an awesome album. I believe this is their defining moment and  Potters Field  will find it hard to match up. Such songs as  Broken, The Way I Feel  and  Fade Away  I believe will be the comparison to the new album. 8/10   &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       At present, I am in Study of Religion and am bored as all hell. I got this kewl idea just then. I reckon I'll start making this blog a bit of an album review thingy ma bobby... I reckon it'll give me something to do and maybe you know I might get a bit better at explaining music. Cuz I listen to a fair bit of music this is pretty kewl in actual fact cuz it gives me a reason to listen to music in excess...lol no complaints here...until tonight&nbsp;P.S Quote 0f the day is.....&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   It is not the critic who counts; Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; Who strives valiantly; Who errs, and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; But who does actually strive to do the deeds; Who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; Who spends himself in a worthy cause; Who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worse, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.   - Theodore Roosevelt

       Yesterday, I trudged on down to Pacific Fair to cash in on my HMV voucher given to me by my sister on my birthday, which was like six months ago. I had my heart set on getting this new album by a band I have just found out about, heard one or two of their songs and thought, why not give it a go. On arrival I went straight to the alternative or rock section whichever they call it these days, and noticed some punk kid dressed in all that wigga clothing make off with the last copy. I was pissed. I think the fact that person who presents themselves in such a fashion would not fully appreciate this type of music. Then I thought again, maybe he does. Sorta opened my mind a bit to how we perceive others just by the way the dress and make and instant judgment by what we see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   I shall tell you a great secret my friend. Do not wait for the last judgement, it takes place every day.  - Albert Camus  I know for a fact, if I was judged on first looks, I wouldn't get far. So rather then approaching this bloke, I merely stood back and took acceptance in the fact that I could order another copy of the album. Matter of fact, had it not been for that kid, I would not have found the album I'd been looking for, for about 3 months. Music As A Weapon II. Best album, live recordings by Disturbed, Chevelle,Taproot, and Unloco. Worth the buy because you pick up a free concert DVD with it so I wasn't complaining. I don't know if any of you have checked my profile, but I am a huge Metallica fan, and was absolutely blown away when I saw that Disturbed had done a Metallica cover in their concert. So I guess I enjoyed this album more then I would the Three Days Grace one, so I say thanks to that kid =P.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       I just found out I could get this stuff for free, so I thought why not. Well I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I'd prefer not to devulge my age =P. I come from the land down under, yes that's right, I'm Australian and damn proud about it. Music is probably the biggest component in my life, I'm single, I'm male (Yes ladies, send your pictures :D), I listen mainly to hard rock and alternative, though sometimes some slower music is kewl aswell. Well I'll stop now cuz I dont know what else to write about so, umm yer, enjoy my gutless rabblings.
