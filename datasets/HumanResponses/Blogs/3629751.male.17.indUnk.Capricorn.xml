      Julio on the road again........  Chapter 3 Its japan baby, months have progressed and Julio and his friends are in Japan. They do the usual stuff tourists do, shop, look around. Go to Tokyo, spend a while there, where some yakuza recognise Julio and say hello to him to the disbelief of his friends. Julio displays his iceness by shaking off his friends questions onyl saying hes been th Japan. They then travel around a bit, and then his friend John- a martial arts fanatic, wants to visit a Shinto shrine. They go to the shrine, where a martial arts youth competition is being held. They watch the competition where champion of the tournament asks if any of the group would want a friendly fight. John gladly accepts but is soon on the flat of his back, and then the champion (Jiro)asks specifically Julio to fight due to the cold look he seems to give him. Julio at first declines, but constant taunting forces him to take the challenge. Julio takes his stance on the mat, which prompts Jiros trainer Tecumo to warn Jiro that Julio knows how to fight. Jiro drunk on his victory takes no heed from his trainer's warning and begins a rapid sequence of kicks and punches which Julio easily blocks and eludes. Julio then begins his own fighting sequences which ends with Jiro on the floor. Jiro is angry and acknowledges that Julio knows how to fight, and so he really begins to fight Julio. Julio at first seems hardpressed, but then reveals his true marital arts (name it later). Jiro does a jumpkick, which Julio dodges by going to the ground, and then springs up with a roundhouse kick that makes contact, he follows it with a double punch which sends Jiro flying. He rises in disbelief, and Julios friends are dumbfounded at his fighting ability

      When I Smile.......Bitch.......Better Smile Back  Im so god damn lazy, all the assessments ive done this term and the ones i still have left for this term are seriously the product of serious laziness which = a load of bullshit and lack of effort. I need respite, i need time, i need freedom. Damn i hate assignments, give me tests, much easier to handle. In class essays galore BLOODY HELL. Ive just been concentrating on so much of this skool crap, and they think its time to start thinking about a career and stuff, well i have no clue wat i want to do because of conflicting interests, for example:  what i really want to do does not coincide with one of the supreme interests in my life: money  Im torn, if i did what i want to do i wouldnt neccesarily get much money and my parents would probably think im stupid, but i dont care. In essence im a scholar, and thats what i want to be, i want to learn about interesting stuff, but get paid shitloads.  Fuck commerce and economics by themselves, its complete utter boringness, wearing suits, sitting on a desk and all crap. Edwin, do u really think its gonna be easy? It'll take you 15 years to really hit it, and i bet you'll quit by then, and if u do finances Edwin, i know you'll lose your soul adn jus by a dormant robot doing the same shit over again.  I want variety, i want each working day to be different then the other, i want to enjoy doing wat im doin because of wat im doin, not because of wat im getting paid.  Problem is im material like a bitch, money makes me feel secure, money makes me buy what i need, and i want a lot of it, i wont deny it, im greedy, as Gecko in Wall Street says 'Greed is Good, Greed purifies'.  Too much conflicting emotions and feelings, and i probably wont get over 90 UAI anyway, im so crapped at the moment. I need serious motivation from someone, anyone, i need a drive, i need words spoken out of seriousness, dammit i need to feel good in order to do my best  Problem is I havent felt good in months.............

      Im bored right now, just want to put story to paper so I remember.  Chapter 2 Well on the low down, this chapter will focus on Julio as a boy and his relationship with his friends, so all friendly bullshit crap occurs, then it comes to the mind of hsi friends that they should go somewhere overseas at the end of the year for skoolies or after skoolies. His friend Q (no name yet) suggests Japan, and the others seem hooked on the idea, except Julio who shows disinterest and contempt at the idea, but ultimately acceeds to his friends, nottelling them that he's been there before or that he is even Japanese (tells his friends hes got Chinese, which is true on filo fathers side)

      "And Its Much Too Late, And I Cant Go Back, Im Sorry, I Cant Be.....Perfect" Cant get that infernal song out of my mind. Been listening to too much music lately, not only Rnb, but all this other stuff; Bryan Adams, The Eagles, James Taylor, Stevie Wonder, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, and all this other old soft crap. Its all pretty good though, these guys dont do any full electronic backsinging and stuff, tis pure genuine stuff (stuff, trying not to swear it seems).  Im so sick today, my parents went out and i got so bored, started watching DVDs when i should be preparing for my assessments, well i say 'f*ck it'. Watched 10 Things I Hate About You, which is surprisingly alright and funny, but the sappy love and teen drama enticed me into watching Gladiator after it, and damn the killing and the blood as always warrants applause from me. I love that part Maximus picks up the two swords and chops the guys head off in a scissor motion. No i am not crazy/psycho, i just like gorey movies. I realise what I am now is the result of decisions i have made in my life.I look in the mirror everyday, and i ask myself, 'Am I what i want to be', and the answer is always no. For there will always the lingering regrets of past decisions that have made me lose physical and emotional parts of my life, and it is not a simple case of forgetting. I know im being general and brief at the most, but im yet to be trustworthy of fully utilising this blog thing in advocating what i feel and am in specific terms. This is due to the fact, what i reveal and admit is something i cannot believe nor people understood unless they are in my shoes, and for u stupid idiots with sick twisted minds, no, im not gay (fucken idiots).  John is closest to knowing who i am and what my 'thrills' are, as well as the stuff ive done in the past, for i warrant myself as a great manipulator of things, and believe i have manipulated so much in my life to fall my way. Some people out there have done or felt things because they think its of my own free will, but i essence, i force them into a path in which i make the end.  555Souless

      Hey Hey Hey (in a husky voice), im losing my voice, but today seems to have been  a day of constant abuse and agression. No I dont have PMS liek some dumbcunts think I have, its just sometimes I feel the urge to just go full anger crazy. QLD WON!!!!!!!!! FUCK YEAH. Sorry for the profanity, its my nature, deal with it.  On a deeper note, I wonder lately about who I am and what I am to do. Im loving the possible future, but Im seriously hating the present. Too much worries and doubts about my life, Im on a course that I dont want to be in, a man of extremes, Pure Agression and Unconsideration. I have no idea what im on about, but yeah, you cant explain what you feel through words, only glimpses.  Now onto politics, Fuck America, they think they the PO-LICE, I wonder with what I learn in legal about International Court of Justice and their invitations to use them, I say your a bunch of pussies. The world needs a strong arm that isnt biased towards one country, they need a crazy motherfucker like me leading an army with jurisdiction all over the fuckign world, and ill blow Bushes ass into the fucking sky. And the fucking poor people, what the hell? A dollar a day does not help, a dollar will not cover food and water, buying clothes, going to school, paying rent, or any personal items. IF they dont want to be poor, they got to make it themselves.  [555Soul]

      Well, well, my first Blog. Any moments of excitement and enthusiasm,NOPE!!! People think I'll write here what I think, and maybe I will. The problem is I think too much and I think a lot of random shit, like shitloads of random crap. Well, theres some stuff I just wont tell, but for now I'll just stick to a re-telling of my day and stuff that has piqued my interest, might even have special segments, like I've always wanted to write all the stories I think up in my mind.  Today, it was crap, all day just like 'Shit, business and economcis due over the next two days', didn't play ball, t'was wierd. Too many tightasses, like Rae, took you long enough to let me look at your assignment, errrrr, too busy to right more, got to study business                                                       555Soul

      Chapter 12 Well the party to begins at earnest, with various yakuza's dancing with their dates or girls supplied by the Takeda. Some of Julio's friends can't help but stare at some of the girls. Ho-oh and Francis come up to them with more of Julio's cousins: Maki (Takeda Ryoma), Oki (Takeda Bishu). The family members greet each other, and Julio introduces these people too, and soon Julio's male friends are finding yakuza women to dance with, while his cousins keep company Julio's friends. Its at this time, a Takeda henchman comes up to him and informs him of request from Takeda Ichindar to see him. Julio is bemused at the request and is reluctant to go, but follows the man anyway. He goes through the sidehall of the floor up a flight of stairs, passing many Takeda guards. He sees that he is on the floor with the glass box overlooking the floor. He notes the guards on the floor as Gaiden, and each looks at him passively, and in a certain view dissatisfied. All have heard of the reputation of Julio, and are surprised at his physique and lack of radiance. He is about to enter the glass box, when the door opens and Kiriyoto exits. The two know each other, and both acknowledge each other, giving brief hints of previous meetings. Julio enters and sees Takeda Ichindar behind the desk standing up, staring through the glass at the party below. Seated before his desk are Imagawa Shuruga- the First Advisor, and Takeda Mitsurgi- his cousin. TI talks first, complaining at the enormous cost of his party, exclaiming the needless waste. He turns his attention to Julio, stating how big he had become. TI also jests about his trip around Japan, but then he gets straight to business and asks what Julio knew he was going to ask: "Work with the family, the family needs you" Julio becomes very distressed and refuses, but&nbsp;Shuruga and Mitsu speak up for the first time, emphasising the need for him, a person of his calibre.&nbsp;Shuruga stresses the need for him exclaiming, 'The best men for this kind of job, are those who dont want to do it, dont enjoy it, but are ultimately bloody born to do it'. Julio is having none of it though, and explains to them, "If you really were family, you wouldn't ask me to do these kind of things. The life of giving&nbsp;pain and death, is a life none of us should choose to take.' With that, Julio steps out of the glass office, totally ignoring the pleas of his cousin.

      I hate this, I just want to see my uncle one more time, I never really got to say goodbye and the last time I saw him its like a 'farewell, ill see you again soon' and that was 4 years ago, and I havent seen him. And my family, they're all going crazy now. I called my dad, and my God, its just so depressing to hear the tone of his voice, its so husky and deep because you know he's breaking down, my father, the only man of the house now. And me, I hate referring or acknowledging the dead, so I just talk to him normally about what I'm up to, because Im so scared to ask him how the whole ..funeral went, how everybody was, did he go out with dignity, did you have a beer in his honor. Its all crazy, and my mum is also breaking down, missing my uncle and very worried about my dad.  But, I feel like ive lost something, a source of knowledge, of my heritage, because I know and remember what life with my family was like before everyone died. When my Tatay Irenio and Nanay Chaling, Tito Boy and Tito Lito were all alive, we were a true family, it was the true glory days of family. A party was a party, the six sisters and brothers and their parents, with all their children- my numerous cousins. But as each of my family dies, its one step further from the glory days of my family, an obstacle in the unity of family to act as a family. Only my aunties are alive, and they're bloody spread apart, one in Australia, one in USA and one in the Philippines. Tito Lito was pretty much the last link that linked my family, because everyone loved him, he brought the family together, he was the messenger and the 'taxi driver', he got everyone to come. He'd even bring the distant elements of the family, bringing my dads cousins from everywhere and they'd all drink, without him there is no pretext to get all those hundreds of cousins as my dad doesnt have that strong bond his older brother had with these older peoples. Its a shame, because all my dad wanted was to have a big family gathering, with all his distant cousins from Zambales and Cavite to come, just once to relive the days of his family. And he wanted Tito Lito to be there with him when he had that party, and also when he retired in the Philippines, and I know he'd want me at that party, to know how big your family is, to know what it is to be Soriano, the blood. Funny my mum told me 20 minutes ago, 'take care of your blood, your family'. The family heritage, celebrance and unity is dying out, the glory is dying out and ultimately its left to me to lift his burden, to maybe just try to bring the family together in celebration to the glory days of my Great Grandfather. My dad was the youngest, but he was given the family home, and ultimately that home will go to me, but i bloody vow this 'Ill bring up my family knowing who we are and what we are, and ill bloody have one huge motherfucking family gathering at that place, i will gather the clans in commemoration to all those we love and have lost, so help me God.' Its things like this that make me want to have a huge family.  &nbsp;

       &nbsp; Chapter 11 The Birthday night has arrived, and Julios friends are all dressed up (4 girls and 6 guys in total, never really said who Julios friends were, fix that up later). They go to the lobby, and outside where they see a huge black stretch limo waiting for them. They hop in, and the limo heads off for the convention centre. They reach the centre and see many limos already lined up, with dozens of black suited guards all over the area.  Julio gets out first and leads the group to the entrance, where a serious sumo like guard looks at them seriously. Invitations he asks, and Julio cant believe he doesnt remember who he is.Julio grabs the sumo's cheeks and gives them a wobble. At that instance the sumo remembers and slaps Julio on the head. They both laugh and Julio introduces the sumo yakuza named Matsunaga Sakuraba as an old friend who use to train with him. Saku ushers them into the building. They walk up a flight of stairs with other guests and stand atop a balcony where they see the conference floor. On the floor their over 500 tables that can sit 10 people, with a stage and empty space at the end of the floor. Guardsmen walk through the floor, as well as through the balconies surrounding the floor. A servant ushers them into a table that is in the middle line of the floor and close to the stage. Julio appears to be alert as he sits down and realises that many people had not arrived yet. The group are sitting down, when suddenly two guys grip Julio from behind give him a slap on the back. Julio turns around and breaks into smiles, and begins to introduce the two. They are Julio's filo/jap cousins Francis(Takeda Yasuyri) and Ho-o (Takeda Genrei). The two are amiable characters and notice Julio's female friends, giving the odd remark. The girls act affable towards them, and the two cousins sit down with them. H (name her later) asks where everyone is, Ho-o replies that the party is only beginning. A large group of men appear on the floor, adn H asks who they are. Francis begins to introduce the people as they come.  The Great Families, in order of appearance: Ando Family- Lead by Ando Katori, old family, overlord of Hokkaido and Northern Honshu. Ando control the northern shipping routes, drug trade through Russia, Canada and the USA through Alaska. Tough warriors, very conservative and keep to the old code, and have an affinity for the snow. Ando’s first advisor is Hatekayama Keyoke, leader of the yakuza of his namesake, old family. Takeda allies, hate the Uesugi.  Uesugi Family- the Uesugi comprise of the original Uesugi family, and various related families, Satake, Satomi, Nagao and Ashikaga. Control Eastern Honshu facing Pacific Ocean. Lead by Uesugi Kiri, a frail old man in a wheelchair, a cunning strategist. Other members of the entourage include the 5 heirs of the Uesugi families, Uesugi Kenshin- like his father, but a fierce fighter, also rumoured to be their leading assassin, Satomi Gawa, Nagao Yagata, Satake Kodo, and Ashikaga Yoshiritsu. The 5 are close friends and very dangerous fighters. Uesugi affluent in all criminal areas, but specialise in the sex trade, have a huge global network. Hate the Ando, and are Takeda allies  Choshu Family- The overlord family of Western Honshu, style themselves as patriots, not as old as the other families, hence have a tendency to try new things, new crimes are developed , they are the first to implement them. They are great users of technology and firearms. They don’t have good close combat fighters.  &nbsp;They have the most men, but lack specialised soldiers. They are lead by Choshu Nobutada, a fat and temperamental man. Don’t like to fight other yakuzas  Satsuma Family- use to control Kyushu, but relinquished their holdings as they melted into the legitimate society. As a symbolism of their legitimacy, they only send three representatives: Satsuma Mori- son of Satsuma boss Satsuma Taka, very good fighter, but vain; and then his bodyguard ‘Khan’- Mongolian, cant talk as he has no tongue, big and rumoured to carry a curved scimitar; and Shimazu Takahisa, CEO of Shimazu Defense Force Industries and leader of the Shimazu yakuza who were once vassals to the Satsuma but are now the primary stakeholder of the Satsuma’s relinquished holdings.  Toyotomi Family- arch nemesis of the Takeda, they control Shikoku and the area around Kyoto bordering with the Choshu. Equal to the Takeda in almost everyway, they keep to the old ways and are an old family, descended from Toyotomi Hideyoshi who was born common, and the unifier of Japan. Have blood of the Oda, Tokugawa, Saito, and Matsudaira. Originally come from a part of the domain that the Takeda now hold. Notorious for cunning, deceit and shadow games. Lead by Toyotomi Andarro, a bed ridden old man, who is Takeda Ichindar’s rival, does not attend bday. In his stead is his son Toyotomi Sezu, Kondo Isami, Hijikata Toshizu and Saito Hajime. All are Shinsengumi leaders, with the latter 3 styled the ‘Noguchi butchers’.  Takeda Family- Julio’s family, huge entourage. Old family, they are the overlords of the regions between Kyoto, and Tokyo, pretty much central Honshu. They originate from the region around Kai. Bitter rivalry with the Toyotomi. First of the entourage come the Five Generals, the top commanders of the Takeda after the oyabun: Toyette aka Takeda Mitsurugi- the cousin of Julio and a half jap/filo as well. He is referred to as Takeda’s Foreign General. This is due to his position as Takeda’s overseer of foreign operations. He is responsible for the commencement of its Australian, American, and Mainland Asian operations Hattori Miyamoto- The Ninja Commander, leader of Takeda’s ninja gaiden. The operations he has been involved in are very secret, but it is acclaimed he is a true master at his arts and the shadows. Vert quiet and taciturn man Takeda Rokoshi- son of Takeda Kenjin(Deceased), younger brother of Takeda Ichindar and hence his nephew. Vain and proud, honourable yet terrible once angry, his vainess and good looks have earned him the nickname the ‘Flower Warrior’, which has suited him perfectly with his Red Lotus kenjutso. One of Takeda’s Offensive Generals, sharing the position with his cousin….. Takeda Akechi- aka ‘The Red Viper’, son of Takeda Surani(Deceased) youngest brother of Takeda Ichindar and also his nephew. The Red Viper is the other Offensive General and both cousins have a fierce hatred and rivalry with each other. Though both are equal in their exploits and victories, The Viper is acclaimed as the best tactician and strategist in the Takeda yakuza, his patience and cold ferocity has earned him a reputation of dread among the other yakuzas. He heavily believes in the underground laws and believes every debt must be paid in full, be it financial or blood debt. Imagawa Shuruga- an old man on the same level as Takeda Ichindar, he holds the title as First Advisor to Takeda Ichindar and is also one of his best friends. He is descended from an old family and his service to the Takeda has been unquestionable. In his hey day, it was remarked that he was the greatest general. Some old timers still believe this, and it is always remarked that he still has a few tricks up his sleeve. These are the five generals, and after their numerous underlings and guards pass through, the siblings of Takeda Ichindar enters: Takeda Kiriyoto- the only son of Takeda Ichindar and Sakawa Masai and youngest child is unique in his family’s history. He is a trained fighter and at his best is unusually mediocre, compared to the family’s aptitude in breeding excellent fighters. But he has inherited his father’s wit an patience, to the point in being describe as being bookish intelligent. Ichindar loves his son fiercely despite his shortcomings as a warrior, but some Takeda members are edgy about the future under Kiriyoto.  Takeda Maracoma- the oldest child of Ichindar, simply referred to as Mara, the acclaimed Jade Queen is very intelligent and runs the Takeda Corporation, the legitimate divisions of the Takeda Family. She is described as beautiful as many and is reputed to have a taste for men…and women, but she is a full acclaimed and trained ninja gaiden member. B the day she plays the iron businesswoman of the Takeda, but by night she is the Jade Ninja of the Gaiden And with a boom, flash of lights, the emergence of balloons and streamers, the Takeda leader, the oyabun appears: Takeda Ichindar- oldest son of Takeda Kamatsu and Uesugi Nayo. He is the oyabun and supreme boss of the Takeda yakuza. He is the commander of the Blitzwing and has sole authority over their operations. He has lived a long and very eventful life as the Takeda boss after his dad died, using cunning and strong arm tactics to strengthen and increase the Takeda domain to its current state. It is said that no one loves the Takeda name as much as him, and he is willing to sacrifice all for the maintenance and preservation of the Takeda name. He has lost many friends and family as he strengthened the Takeda, including his brothers Surani and Kenjin, and his beloved sister Kalia. The guests are all in, the party is beginning, and Julio can only begin to wonder what will happen tonight.

      Live never seemed so wierd, a loss of love is one thing, but the loss of a loved one forever is another. Manolito Soriano, my Uncle/Tito has died, he is the brother to my father Edgardo Soriano and son of Irenio Soriano. He is the first person in my life who has died who mean something to me.  He was like a presence, that made itself always felt when I was in the Philippines. In truth, he talked and acted like a conman and drunk, but it was these qualities that shaped a man that the whole barangay(suburb) loved. He was the local fix-it man, and I dont mean with appliances, if people in his hood had problems with someone else or council, or needed another specialists help, they went to him. He'd help and drink with them too. Drink was his killer, and he knew it but he did it anyway. It hasn't sunk in yet, I expect to go to the Philippines, walk up the stairs of our ancestral home, and see this skinny old man with a beer gut, saying 'Kamusta Sam-well' and then its all hugs and crap. Everyday he is there when we are there, acting like the older brother he is to my dad, always helping him with fixing our old ancestral home, the Soriano home. He was in hospital the day he died, but I bet he knew he was gonna die, and he chose to go home saying he was fine. He asked my Aunty Ning to come over and sleep in the bed next to him because he wanted her close, and his wife Tita Tess was there, and like the wind he was gone. He is not the first to die in that room, his older brother my Tito Boy and their father Tatay Irenio both died in that room. People will say its cursed, but i'd like to refer it as a tradition or legacy of my family. I bet my dad will die in that room, and I wont be sad if he does, because he will be in the home that he loved, united with those already gone. I never took to really understand who my family is, what being a Soriano means, and I by choice also want to die in that room. Tito Manolito aka Kuya Lito was ever like the conman, yet he was not, he was loyal to his family, helpful to those in need, and forever loving of everyone that encompassed the Soriano clan. Let me tell you a little about him, he went to high school and was a rebel, and dropped out of college becasue he could'nt be stuffed, and I'm telling you he never got a job after that. He was just a man of the city, helping others for a bit of this and that and ultimately he lived like a King, although he really had no job. I'd bloody go to the Philippines and its like he never works, just buming around with my dad, or their Shao-lin looking bikie cousins getting drunk and going crazy.  He loved the drink, gambling and money. It was gambling that really united the two of us. I'd like to say Im a bit of a lucky charm when it comes to cock fighting adn the sabong( the fighting arena/pit). I choose the chicken, he'd bet the money for the both of us. I was mroe of a safe player, gaining small profits, but he was a big time gambler getting the high stakes. Hahahaha i remember the sabong we went to, i'b bet 50 pes0s on a chicken, he'd bet 2000 pesos, we bet on 37 cock fights that day and night, and we had 32 wins, 3 losses and 2 draws, when we won I was extremely happy, but those losses we suffered were small for me, but huge for him and he was crying in agony. One of my titos, or my dads cousins was also there and had two chickens which had both won, so we got to keep the dead chickens of our opponents, which me and my uncles ate.  He was just such a lovable guy, he was connivivng and funny, quirky, and he made everyone luagh, he drak all the time but he didnt care, San Miguel and JB. I dont know what to do, i want to go tohis funeral but my dad wont let me, but i promise ill visit your home of eternal rest

      Chapter 10 They are back in Tokyo, and the group check in at a hotel. Julio comes back into his old Australian normal boy self, as they go around shopping and looking at more sights. 3 days of tourism have passed and they are exhausted. After an afternoon spent sightseeing at the Omiya Imperial Palace, they retreat to their hotel rooms, only to find packages for each of them and invitations. Julio reads the invitation adn is angered. The invitation is to the 85th bday of Takeda Ichindar, boss of the Takeda family. The invitation arrives with high roller suits and dresses for each of Julio's friends, and, to the fright of Julio's friends, are perfect fits. Julio understands that they cannot decline this invitation, if not for his sake, then for the sake of his friends they must go. The party is to be held tomorow night at the Japan Foundation Conference Hall, and they will be picked up. Julio is very angry and knows what a big gathering like this means to him....

      Back to Baghdad, a bloody awesome game, playing as delta force and killing Iraqis, quite fun especially when tanks smash through walls. Well nothing to really sya, dont really have any problems, is all good really, its all smile :) :) :) So lets get this chapter over and done with!!!  Chapter 9 Julio and his friends have been in Japan for two months now, 4 weeks of it spent in Makoto's mountain valley school. Julio and his friends have found peace and tranqulity in the valley, having fun times and conversations with Makoto, and the other denizens of the school. Some of Julio's friends have taken up lessons in fighting. Each day Julio has been training, honing his martial arts, but never once picking up a sword. Makoto constantly remarks to Julio's friends that his true power lay in the sword. Mia and Julio have also fostered a growing relationship within the 4 weeks, spending theri spare time in conversation. The group have spent too long in the valley, and opt to leave tomorow and head back towards Tokyo. Dinner that night is a banquet for the group as Makoto gives them a farewell dinner. Julio is in a jovial mood but seriousness returns as he goes out to breathe some air. Mia joins him and she comes close to him. She is in silence as she takes Julios hand and caresses it upon her face. Tears fall down her face and Julio wipes them away with is hand. Mia whispers to him not to go, but Julio is cold and simply states that he cant and that there can be nothing between them. Who they are makes them a perfect match in the eyes of Takeda, but the relationship would prove another hook for the Takeda in acquiring Julio's services. Julio explains that he would stay with her, but not here, not in a world surrounded by those who would seek to use the both of them. Mia understands and walks away, but Julio clenches his fists and stares into the night............... The mext morning the group is awake and ready to go. Makoto and Iriji are seeing them off, and Iriji explains Mia's absence as she said she was sick. Julio understands, and the group leave in a taxi bus for Sapporo to catch a ship to Tokyo.

      Watched Spiderman 2 today, it was not bad, but i rekon he's a pussy. Need better supervillans. Bored lets begin chapter 8  Chapter 8 After such a story, Julio's friends start to wonder about how Julio knows so much and know this Takeda they seem to hear about. Julio runs off at this time, but Makoto enters the room. He explains to them that Julio knows all this as he is Takeda by blood, and his Japanese name is Takeda Shingen, and that he taught him to fight for the yakuza. He tells them it is because of tragic stories like that of Ryu and Eru that Julio neva took up the call to service for the yakuza. Furthermore, Julio did not want to be apart of a family that makes its bread through pain and suffering, and also the fact that Julio knows how to kill, skills Makoto taught him. Makoto explains Julio does not want to become a weapon, and he shares distrust and contempt for most of the Takeda yakuza, with the exceptions of his filo/jap takeda cousins. Julio's friend Tommy has teh nerve to ask Makoto if Julio ever killed someone, Makoto regretfully replys 'yes, but it is something that u will have to talk with Julio, not me'. Julio's friends are wary of approaching him about the subject. Meanwhile, Julio has walked outside, where the snow has started to fall. He sits down on the wooden terrace, watching the snowflakes fall down, while in deep contemplation. Mia comes outside and sits down next to him. She asks him not to look so down. Julio plays dumb by replying wat do u mean. Mia explains that Julio doesnt smile very much nor is very happy. Julio explains it is just a phase but Mia knows its more then that. Striking the subject at heart Mia states u cant change what blood runs through your veins. Julio admits he is not proud to be Takeda, mostly due to the fact that they conduct illegal activities, and he even exclaims to her 'Do you love the Takeda, when it may mean that they killed your dad, and your uncle?' Mia deftly replies 'it was another time, another era, i never knew them and what proof do you have that the Takeda did it'. Julio trys to explain to her...'Your grandfather trained me to kill, in the arts of hand-to-hand combat, kenjutsu and even bloody ninjitsu, didnt know he knew that one did yah? Then after that i got trained as Blitzwing, expanding my knowledge they called it. Im a fully fledged Blitzwing and Gaiden trained soldier. The Takeda want me coz i can kill, and i can kill good. Ive killed before, more then once, i protected your grandpa from bloody Toyotomi, and i sliced their throats, chopped theri heads and all that, but the worst thing is i enjoyed it. Dammit Mia, i got the battle lust, the blood frenzy. Im afraid i kill more, ill enjoy it, adn i vowed never to touch a weapon again or bloody work with my family. I'll die before i do that again.' Mia understands and is shocked, becuase the boy he sees in her eyes does not seem to be the blood warrior. Mia tells him to confide his fears, and Julio relents, and the two talk about each others fears, their suspicions until the day fades into the night. Julio never realises that Mia has been calling him Shingen the whole time.

      I salute you Brad Fitler with your fairytale win, even though I was going for QLD!!! Ah well, next year is a new series with......Karmichael Hunt with his invincible step. Have you heard?? Amos Roberts, one of the sickest Panthers is going to Roosters next year. All I can say is SHIT MATE. Well i hate him now as i hate all the cocks of that team. But on that note, lets begin chapter 7  Chapter 7 The chapter opens up on in the mountain valley still in the morning, where we see Iriji giving offerings and praying to what appears to be a two shrine/graves. Julio's friends watch her with fascination from a distance, until Julio joins them all sweaty from his previous bout. They enquire about who she is praying for. Julio ushers them inside and begins to tell the tragic story of Iriji's life. The two graves belong to her brother and husband who were best friends. The husband is Hojo Ryu, Makoto's son, while the brother is Noguchi Eru. Ryu was a Takeda yakuza while Eru was Noguchi yakuza, in fact the heir to the gang from his father Noguchi Katsuo.  There tale is set 17 years ago, when both were 23 yrs old. When growing up Ryu and Eru were best friends and brother in everything but blood. They trained under Makoto and were acclaimed as the best Makoto had trained at the time. They were opposites of each other and together were an unstoppable team. The Noguchi were a vassal and ally to the Takeda and were powerful in their own right, having control over the old imperial capital of Kyoto. The two of them were a symbolism of the unity and honour of those days, and because of the constant time spend with the Noguchi, it was no surprise Ryu and Iriji fell in love with each other. Eru was happy enough for Ryu to become his brother in law, and the marriage was approved by both families and yakuzas. So far life was at a bliss for the two, but soon it was shattered by the machinations of the Toyotomi yakuza, who began to turn their eyes towards Kyoto. The Noguchi were soon being besieged by daily Toyotomi insurgents. Noguchi businesses were getting torched and shut down, soldiers dying or changing sides, while the Toyotomi were replacing them with their own. The Noguchi were losing, and needed help fast, so Eru's father asked for help from the Takeda. The Takeda were at odds with the decision to help: they could help but it would escalate in a full war between two of the Great Families, which would be bad for business and bring the attention of the authorities. But they could also stay out and the Toyotomi would leave them alone, adn maybe they could absorb some of the Noguchi domain. Ryu pleaded for hsi yakuza to help, even claiming he'd go by himself if he had to. It fell to vote, and it was voted 6-4 against aiding the Noguchi. It was noted that Takeda Akechi aka The Red Viper, nephew of Takeda boss Takeda Ichindar and one of the leading Takeda generals held the vote to win, and voted against. Ryu was furious at the Takeda leaders, but promised to hold his own and not send aid. The Noguchi were getting massacred and no one was coming to their aid. And one frightful night the end came at the Noguchi mansion in the mountains overlooking Kyoto. The Noguchi negotiated an end battle with the Toyotomi, and asked for honor with the fighting to be purely by old style combat (swrods, hand to hand etc) The Toyotomi reluctantly accepted knowing full well the capabilities of Eru. Well the best deserved the best, so the Toyotomi sent their Shinsengumi- an elite cadre of their best assassins and swordsman, supported with Toyotomi henchmen to storm teh Noguchi castle. Ryu learnt of the attack and he could no longer hold himself back, he gathered those loyal to him and friends to Eru, such as Haki Saigo the Axe and Kochi Echigo the peaceful, and they quickly go to the Noguchi castle, defying Takeda edict. Before he goes Ryu sees Iriji, promising that he will return with Eru and her father; dead or alive. Iriji is confused in what to do, Ryu could save her brother, but they could both die, but she relents to let Ryu try, never telling him that she is pregnant with Mia. Ryu and his group go to the Noguchi castle and burst through when the Toyotomi are about to finish the last remnants of the Noguchi. Eru's father Katsuo lies dead in the garden, with the remaining Noguchi including Eru defending his body. Eru is revitalised by Ryu's emergence and they fight together as they did before. Soon the Toyotomi are on the retreat, and the Shinsengumi start to fall, Aki Sagato the Terrible falling to Saigo's axe, the dancing Shikita Naji is slit by Kochi. The Toyotomi retreat changes into a full run out to the entrance of the Noguchi Castle. The combined Noguchi and Takeda forces follow and come outside only to see a line of black clad men (covered from head to toe) armed with guns. Eru and Ryu know that they will die with their honour intact, adn the Toyotomi without theirs. They charge and soon the bullets pour, and they fall to teh gravel as one, as brothers. The Noguchi were wiped out and of the Takeda only Saigo and Kochi survive. Saigo with a bullet that knocked him unconscious but not dead, Kochi after shielding himself and playing dead. Of the Toyotomi Shinsengumi, only Kondo Isami, Hijikata Toshizu and Saito Hajime live to rebuild the unit. The next morning, the Takeda send their henchmen to the Noguchi compound full knowing what they will see. Saigo and Kochi are found and are about to be punished for defying Takeda edict, but the two demand to be released from teh Takeda yakuza. The Takeda release them from service, but before that they help bring their dead bretheren for burial. They bring Eru, Ryu and all of the otehr dead to Makoto and Iriji who bury them in the mountain valley. It is beleived that Kochi adn Saigo talk with Makoto, and the next day Kochi and Saigo disappear, while Makoto announces his intent to retire from Takeda politics out of grief for his dead son and son-in-law. The Toyotomi are drunk with vicotry and fear and demand the death of Iriji as she is the last Noguchi and is pregnant. But the Takeda are defensive for once and they argue Iriji became Takeda teh day she married Ryu, adn that her expected child is a girl. The Toyotomi are content, and upon retirement Makoto takes Iriji with her to the mountain valley.   All this Julio tells his friends, and John asks him what happened to Saigo and Kochi, to which Julio replys 'no one really knows, it was believed that the Takeda killed them for their insubordination, or the Toyotomi killed them for surviving the fight. But there are darker rumors that they fled for their lives from the Takeda not because of the insubordination but because they knew something. That something people say is that those black clad men with guns were not Toyotomi, but they were Takeda men, the cruelest sort to, the Blitzwing Division, the secret force of the Takeda boss. It is a rumour that both yakuza's decline, but some people are not ready to accept. Simple fact is Ryu and Eru were loved by all and they died dishonorably' At this Julio's friends looks darken and they look at Iriji with newfound respect.

      Disregard the no swearing, too hard, ill just smile. Been studying hard like a bitch, and right now got to put chapter 6  Chapter 6 Julio wakes up early to the sound of tranquilty. He walks outside in the morning while snow sprinkles down. Julio feels at peace in his surroundings and has flashbacks of his training under Makoto. He continues to his morning walk until he walks to one of the gyms, where he sees Mia training with a samurai sword(one with wooden handle, wats it called?). Julio watches her graceful movements, coffee in hand, he is enraptured by her sudden movements and quick thrusts with the sword. He understands that Mia is a weapon, and a true descendent of her grandfather. Mia finally notices his presence and acknowledges him as some kind of intruder. Mia full of herself demands Julio fight her, Julio declines but Mia forces him into it by suddenly charging at him with her sword. Julio is not fooled and parrys her thrusts with her coffee mug. Mia responds with a slice that smashes the mug. Julio retreats until he finds a kitana which he unveils. Mia shows a smile of satisfaction and quirks 'they say u r the best with a sword, a true blademaster, show me'. All Julio can do is raise his sword in a stance, showing a face of remorse. Touching a sword was the last thing he wanted to do, for he indeed was a master, but he vowed never to touch once again. Yet it felt good in his hand, felt right, felt like the way it should be, so he raised it high and then the dance of dragons began. The two locked swords and began a fierce dance, the dance only true practitioners of the sword could. Julio was a blademaster, Mia just a self blown student encouraged by weak opponents, and soon she was on the defensive. Mia began to show a face of anger and need to survive, and suddenly pulled a reckless overswing which Julio blocks and hits her sword away, followed by a lock trip on her ankle. Mia falls but doesnt go quietly and pulls Julio to the ground. They both fall awkwardly and Julio lands on Mia. Awkward moment followed by Mia flipping Julio, who counters with a leg twist then a flip which sends Mia on the wall. Mia groggily tries to get up where he sees Julio with his sword against her throat and says yield. Mia yields and amid her frustration leaves with her anger fuming. Julio smiles and realises the sword in his hand, he throws it towards a mask in the wall, and it hits it square in the head. Julio then walks out of the gym like a ghost.

      We often look at the bad more then we look at the good, so its time we start bloody lookin at the good. Not only that, good things will only happen to you if you make them happen, and its bloody time i started doing that.  THE WORLD IS YOURS--Tony Montana (Scarface) So its time to make a new beginning, take a new path, a new road. A new chapter of my life story, the chapter all of you would never think would be made, the surprise twist, hence i make this pledge but before i say it betta say all the swearing i can : FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT SHIT SHIT, FUCK CUNT , SHITHEAD, DUMBCUNT PRICK, GO FUCK YOURSELF, TELL SOMEONE WHO GIVES A FUCK , DICKHEAD, GO FUCKEN KILL YOURSELF MATE, SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCKFUCK.  'I Pledge to TRY not to swear, too smile out of happiness, and most of all be happy'  We'll see if i can hold to it  Besides this i have chosen to say sorry for anything to the following people: '....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Pretty much Everyone'  So yeah ill try not to be a bitch, but only if u dont bitch on me. F*ck with me and ill f*ck back, keep that on mind.  Chapter 5 Julio and his friends travel by train and boat to the city of Sapporo on the north island Hokkaido. From there they travel to a mountain valley, where there is an infamous martial arts dojo, which is more like a university campus but with its share of feudal Japan architecture. It is owned by Julios former mentor Hojo Makoto, who was descended from the ancient family that bears his name. Makoto is 60yrs old but his mind remains sharp as he recognises and welcomes Julio and his friends into his school. Makoto himself does no longer teach, but his dojo sub sensei's teach over 500 students. Truth is the school trains children of prominent yakuza or gifted yakuza youths. Makoto gives them a tour of his home. Julio's friends are amazed a the school complex, for its built with a mixture of feudal architecture as well as modern technology. They see youths (boy and girl) training doing amazing stunts. Makoto quirks that they are good, but none are on the level of Julio. They are brought to a solarium of some sort, where they are served lunch, and in comes a middle aged woman (40 yrs old) who is Makoto's daughter Iriji. Julio greets her with a warm hug signifying that they know each other. Iriji inquires about Julios wellbeing who replys that he is good. They begin to eat lunch, when suddenly a girl bursts into the room shouting. The girl is slender and beautiful and Julio is mesmerised at an instance. The girl starts at Makoto about lack of competition and getting bored too easily. Makoto and Iriji are embarrased and introduce the girl as Mia. Julio is dumbfounded, as when he had trained under Makoto when he was younger, Mia was an ugly and annoying girl. Mia remembers herself and bows formally to Julio and as they eat Mia asks Julio if he really is good as they say he is. Julio does not understand and Mia explains how he was the best fighter Makoto had probably trained. Julio keeps modest his talents but Mia is adamant and even goes far as to say 'when do we fight'. Julio says he does not want to fight but Mia replys with 'we'll see about that'. Well the eating continues, until Mia excuses herself to do chores, and Julio and hsi friends conversate with Makoto and Iriji until they go to bed. Julio seems distracted by the conversation as he has other things on his mind....

      Dammit i keep listenin to this shit  'I long for the warmth of days gone by When you were mine But now those days are memories in time Life's empty without you by my side My heart belongs to you No matter what I try When I get courage up to love somebody new It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you Your love won't release me I'm bound under ball and chain Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change  In comes the winter breeze That chills the air and drifts the snow And I imagine kissing you under the misteltoe When springtime makes it's way here Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat I always get the hots for you Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare When you're not here it doesn't feel the same  Remember the nights when we closed our eyes And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time Anytime I think about these things I shared with you I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change  In comes the winter breeze That chills the air and drifts the snow And I imagine kissing you under the misteltoe When springtime makes it's way here Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat I always get the hots for you Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare When you're not here it doesn't feel the same  This loneliness Has crushed my heart Please let me love again 'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain Or 4 seasons will bring the loneliness again'  ...............bloody 'Doin Just Fine'  'There was a time when I thought life was over and out When you went away from me My dying heart made it hard to breathe Would sit in my room Because I didn't want to Have to go out And see you walking by One look and I'd break right down and cry Now you say that you made a big mistake Never meant to take your love away But you can save your tired apologies 'Cause it may seem hard to believe, but  I'm doin' just fine Getting along very well Without you in my life I don't need you in my life I'm doin' just fine Time made me stronger You're no longer on my mind   You were my earth My number one priority I gave my love to only you Anything you'd ask of me I would do But somewhere down the road You felt a change in the weather and told me that you had to journey on A kiss in the wind and your love was gone Now you say you never meant to play your games Girl don't you know it's far too late Because you let our love just fall apart You no longer have my heart  I'm doin' just fine Getting along very well Without you in my life I don't need you in my life I'm doin' just fine Time made me stronger You're no longer on my mind  When you said goodbye I felt so all alone There were times at night I couldn't sleep My heart was much to weak to make it on my own Baby after all the misery And pain you put me through So unfair to me girl You're no longer my world and I ain't missin' you at all  I'm doin' just fine Getting along very well Without you in my life I don't need you in my life I'm doin' just fine Time made me stronger You're no longer on my mind  See baby when you walked away You didn't think it would end up this way But I knew you'd come around someday Just as sure as my name is Wanya'  Chapter 4 Following the Julios fight, the old trainer Tecumo and his student Jiro offer the hospitality of their dojo for Julio and his friends to stay and sleep. The dojo is on a large estate owned by Tecumo who trains other fighers in martial arts(find one later). Jiro who appeared as an arrogant and full of himself fighter in the previous chapter has turned a new leaf, suddenly becoming Julios biggest fan. Julio, in touch with the fighting side he had once buried, begins to acknowledge it, asking Tecumo if he can train. Tecumo glady accepts, full knowing the martial arts Julio uses and who he is (belongs to). For about a week the mornings are seen with Julio training in the styles he had once forsaken, with an eager Jiro mimicking his ever move. Julio talks with Tecumo, about his reluctance to fight, but Tecumo warns him that fighting is a part of him he cannot deny. Julio understands this, knowing agression is a part of his heritage as Takeda, but keeps in mind what his family is. The sudden resurgence of his fighting side prompts him to see his teacher who taught him how to fight. His friends go along with him, and they farewell Tecumo and his students, with a disappointed Jiro who wished to follow Julio.
