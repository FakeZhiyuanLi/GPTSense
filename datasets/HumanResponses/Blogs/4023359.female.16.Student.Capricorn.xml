      Well, nothing much went on today at work, except for that fact that from the time I clocked in at 4 in the am to the time I clocked out at 1 in the pm, I was busy doing something....which is very different for me b/c @ 6th Ave.&nbsp; we never have more then&nbsp;20 cars go through at 5 in the am...haha.&nbsp; I got there, made two things of sweet tea and one unsweatened, made 2 reg. coffee pots and two decaf. coffee pots, fixed the coke dispensers, stocked b-fast stuff, changed the hash brown/fry vats, started taking orders, had to take orders, fill orders, and take money all at once by myself until 7 in the am.&nbsp; Then, i went to drive thru money take booth until about 11:30, went on break, got back, went on fries for maybe 15 minutes, went to order take, stocked, and then finally left.&nbsp; That's all there was to it today.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; gotta go!!! buh-byes!

      This blog is going to mainly be about working.&nbsp; haha I decided that since all of my "friends" are tired about going to my blog and reading about work, i'll just make a separate one where (for those who enjoy reading about my working experiences) can still keep up with everything.&nbsp; haha  As some of you may or may not know, they've torn down the 6th Avenue Mcdonald's.&nbsp; It's been down for a whole day now, and it's been closed&nbsp; for almost a week.&nbsp; I've been transfered to Hartselle so I can still get in my hours so I can be able to pay my car payment. heh&nbsp; Okie, that was just a little bit of clearing up information so non of you will be confused about why I'm talking about the Hartselle Mcd's instead of the 6th Ave. one. lol&nbsp;   Today's working experience: Being forced to use the d9mn metal ice scoop in drive thru. lol&nbsp; It takes up too much time and wastes so much ice.&nbsp; It takes up too much time because you have to stand right in front of the ice bin, pick the scoop up, scoop up a couple of scoops, put the ice into the cup,&nbsp;then make the drink (and while you're doing all that, you've&nbsp;got to take orders).&nbsp;&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;I don't know if you guys think I'm crazy for fussing about having to use the&nbsp;scooper thing, but when you&nbsp;are backed up in drive&nbsp;thru and are pending on several orders....it's nerve blowing.&nbsp; I got in trouble early today because I&nbsp;was just scooping with the cup by "Max" (the Hartselle big-wig of mcd's).&nbsp; He&nbsp;was like "Stop what your doing,&nbsp;now look at me"&nbsp; I looked at him.&nbsp; "Do you want your paycheck to be a pleasing one?"&nbsp; I shook my head&nbsp;up and down. "Then you better start using that scoop and stop wasting ice"&nbsp; I was like ooooo, ice costs so much....whoop-de-doo....we&nbsp;even have an ice maker that makes the ice....so&nbsp;how does my paycheck fit into all this? lol&nbsp; There are some weird people at that Hartselle store. lol&nbsp; Then "Max" got onto me about holding the mic when I was trying to take an order where the other person could hear me.&nbsp; He was like "Don't touch that"&nbsp; I mouthed "sorry" to him.&nbsp; Then he walked away and I rolled my eyes.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; And I thought "David" was bad.&nbsp; (David is the big-wig of the 6th Ave. mcd's)&nbsp; It was truely a hectic day at mcd's today.&nbsp; We stayed fairly busy all day long.&nbsp; I've made two new friends, one of them is a manager, and the other one is a junior from Brewer.&nbsp; She's in the band @ Brrr, and also plays clarinet...so we're pretty much the same.&nbsp; We like the same music and we hang out with the same type of people.&nbsp; I found that really freaky.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; And our personalities are the same.&nbsp; Weird. lol&nbsp;  I was asked to come into work tomorrow from 2PM until 8PM.&nbsp; Jay (the schedule head-honcho) came and asked me if I would come into work tomorrow and I said, "I don't know, what time?&nbsp;" "2 until 8"-Jay "Ok, yeah, sure, why not"-me "Well, that was easier then I thought it would be"-Jay "I usually don't give problems with that kind of stuff"- me "Well, you would have had no choice if you did have a problem"-Jay  -I just turned around and took an order that had been beeping on the headset for a few seconds.&nbsp; I thought in my head "b9st9rd".&nbsp; So, maybe not all of the Hartselle people are as nice as I would like for them to be....but a big majority of them are really nice.&nbsp; haha  My schedule for the week of July 26th-August 1st Monday: 4am-1pm Tuesday: off Wednesday:10am-2pm Thursday:off Friday:off Saturday:6am-2pm Sunday:4am-2pm  -I'm not sure if I posted this one on my other blog or not, and I'm too lazy to go check...lol  Well, until I come back from work tomorrow....buh-byes

      Ok, well, work is definately gonna get aggravating with school and band being in the picture now.  Next week I'm only getting 10 hours.  10 hours?!?!?! WTFIT?!  I talked to Marla yesterday and I told her that I had to make enough in two weeks time to make a car payment every month, she said that she would see what she could do.  It just makes me mad when Jay knows that I have more then one free day.  I can work Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays...but does he schedule me for all three of those days? NO...he schedules me 10 hours in one Saturday.  GRRRR!  I work today...unscheduled, however.  Since I was saying that I'm not getting enough hours, Marla asked me to come in today from 2pm until 10pm.  Only 8 hours...not gonna be that bad.  I actually get to work a night at the Hartselle store.  whoo-hoo!!  Okie, well I've gotta go~ got some homework to do before work...so buh-byes

      Well, I have offically decided that working mornings at mcd's sucks. lol  That's when they are really busy (well, more like from 10:00 until 2:00).  But, it still sucks working morning hours because A.) you can't sleep in  and B.) everyone is grouchy.  Explanation: A.) I have wanted to sleep in so bad Monday and Today, I mean, mom was yelling at me Monday morning trying to get me up.  And today, dad came into my room at 6:20 and told me it was almost 6:30.  I jumped out of bed and started putting my clothes on and then started fixing me something for breakfast.  I put one of those crosanwiches  (sp?!?) that you can buy without having to go to Burger King at wal-mart in the microwave.  I didn't eat all of.  I woke up this morning feeling very sick...I don't know why I even went into work today.  When I got there I could do nothing but sneeze and sniffle. lol Becky asked me if i was gonna make it.  I told her yeah, I had no other choice.  Then she said, "well, no you really don't have a choice, you're the best person I've got this morning and any morning, as a matter of fact."  Then she walked away, I was like whoo-hoo... on the inside. lol  B.) Everyone is grouchy because they have to get up early. lol  'nuff said. lol  well, i've run out of things to talk to you about my working experiences the past two days...nothing really interesting has gone on. lol  I just can't wait for our new store to get built and opened.  I'm starting to get tired of the Hartselle Mcd's. heh, gotta go! buh-byes!
