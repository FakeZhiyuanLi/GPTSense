      Day 31 on the campaign trail and the gloves have been off now for a while and I think that any of the gimmicks used by the leaders to lure the fence-sitters like myself to their side will start getting iconic to a degree representing stiffness in the larynx of the throat.  Whoops!  That one slipped.  Oh!  Did it?  Uh, no.  YES!  YES!  He's a pedophile.  A whore.  A dumb servant with little feet and a slanted smile.  Okay.  Responsible for the deaths of all the homeless as Jack Layton has suggested of Paul Martin?  An advocate to child pornography as Stephen Harper has laid wrath on Martin, as well?  We cannot be that stupid.  That may work for individuals who are so persuaded by the  urlLink War-of-the-Worlds Syndrome , but we are  urlLink educated individuals!  And, just to make sure that this stays the course - and in timely fashion as well - Liberal Education Minister for Ontario, Parkdale-High Park MPP Gerard Kennedy, has announced that his government  urlLink plans to quadruple the number of teachers who specialize in reading and writing â€” from 4,000 to 16,000 .  This is a fantastic propostion, one that may heap some desire to stave off the wolves after a deadening roar stemming from a revearsal on a promise made by the ostrich-like Ontario Premier, Dalton McGuinty, and his much maligned healthcare premiums.  This, after promising during the provincial elections last year not to hike  anything.   Thanks and kippis!  A toast to the mid- to upper-class of our society who will have to pay for these premiums, right?    Thank the gods I'm below the poverty line.  I'm open to donations, though.  Just drop me a line.

       Gidday'. Let's leave it to the politicians to make us feel this continual sense of ingrained fright and dislocation. The federal elections are in full swing, here, in Canada, with the English debates taking place last night on most major networks, a veritable sprawl of incense and the common adjectives (&quot;you should be so  bold ;&quot; &quot;you have no  credibility; &quot; &quot;liar, liar your pants are on fire...&quot;)used by the running mates is not glorified. I listened to it on  urlLink  CBCNewsworld    last night while looking for good radio frequencies online. I'd turn around to gaze, momentarily like a wussed-out cacklehead, looking for cookie crumbs and a cigarette, I'd see Prime Minister, Paul Martin, with an adversary as potentially volatile to Canada as Conservative party leader Stephen Harper lobbing sponsorship denunciations at the inculpable former Finance-Minister-turned-Prime-Minister. Gilles Duceppe and Jack Layton could only interject with loathsome goo and glaze over their own agendas.&nbsp; Now, this is all a little much if you hate politics, I know, but I'm going to hate having a Conservative PM. He will sidle up next to Georgie "Porgie" Bush and his fellow Texan neo-Conquistadors (even if the tyrant sits in office after the American November elections, Harper'll still want to go shopping at the  urlLink Wal-Mart's )and plea for better bargaining positions, thus limiting the pace in which we, as a distinct society, have worked so hard to wedge between the differences in our social practices compared to the feeding frenzy open markets of the United States of America. I don't know how well we're succeeding, here, but at least we have some independent media to talk about it, eh?  Canada's dailies   The Globe &amp; Mail   and   The National Post   both have their takes on things, even if they do print the same cover photo as   The Ottawa Sun  .&nbsp; Our pot legislation, abortion rights, and Quebec questions could become bleaker as well as social programs getting flung out the window.   Maybe, I just don't want a Canadian version of Bush.&nbsp; With home-wrecker Stephen Harper, though, and his conservative friends, it just may become that much easier to allow Quebec to slither off the map of Canada leaving me, as a de facto Quebecer sitting pretty in Ottawa wondering why, suddenly, my home province has now become another country.  I can imagine sparks igniting and other detrimental effects will occur.  It will make all our mouths sour, and we will wonder why we ever loosed them in the halls of Parliament in the first place?   Does Canada need this flavor?   Tomorrow, the  urlLink Ottawa Renegades  play their first home game of the 2004 regular season against the Winnipeg Bluebomber's.&nbsp; I am very excited.&nbsp;

      Good to hear that the Renedegas do care about what's going on outside of town on the North.  Read the story of Head Coach Joe Paopao and other Ottawa Renegades players going up to Mistissinii, Quebec for a children's football camp.  Hopefully it will inspire Paopao to figure out how get his own brats to start playing some consitent wins.   urlLink "Cree nation to get guidance from Renegades"

      At a time when documentaries are flourishing in numbers and all attributed towards exposing desperately needed facts and references of the most powerful social and political institutions in the world, checking out such films, as I have done in the recent past, should be just as important as picking up a novel by Mark Twain and Farley Mowat. It's very good to witness a movie by talented individuals- both in front and behind the camera, like Benicio Del Toro and Francis Ford Coppola. I want to listen to the best, too, like Pink Floyd and Trent Reznor. That's not so much to ask. I want to be entertained. I want to blow my freaking mind.  And I want to be able to see the truth.  Here's something interesting. Documentaries are now a marketable endeavour for do-it-yourselvers, and others skilful enough to just make a good film. Independent media at it's best. Now a form of journalism is making a tidal wave comeback. A flourish of video's in the market seems to be at it's peak, and films of interest, like the new one by  urlLink Christine Rose "Liberty Bound"  are popping up at local social establishments, like the  urlLink Ottawa (Central) Public Library , and  urlLink The Bytowne Theatre . Now let's see a whole new side of the story.  Michael Moore may have helped to prop the genre onto another level by jabbing a stick into the hides of the Bush administration and revealing their seemingly inept capabilities as powerful leaders of a great and powerful country and the ridiculously childlike tactics employed before and after September 11th. A jabber head from a blue-collar town in Michigan is not very happy at the way things are going, and has now become a member of the meathead activist groups, that include such distinguished persons as Naomi Klein and Greg Palast, Howard Stern, and Marilyn Manson. There had to be a break from the deflation of acceptable news and entertainment content, and the time to tell it like it is before it's too late, couldn't come sooner. Before... BOREDOM!  I feel that people should be saying "There has to be a better way." And there is. Just listening to the plight of desperate people, in a desperate world, where people are  urlLink dying unnecessarily  would make anyone aware that to make things a lot more friendly is to create a friendly atmosphere,eh?  Nah. Instead we have to listen to madmen talking to other, or not talking to other, or just plain talking  at  other madmen. And, in a way it can be quite hilarious at times, comical, but then it can get frustrating, foolish, and quite, uh, crazy. I have had my fair share of conversations with madmen and I do have to say, they can be some kind of fun. Just watch the spit, and the sudden aggression, and you'll be alright. They can get both physical and psychological. I'd tell you about  urlLink 'Prof.' Scott Starling , but I've heard that he doesn't like to be talked about in the press - unless he knows about it, and he consents. The genius is, after all, in the starry abyss. What should be done, is to find some kind of grounds where, when worlds collide, we have the structures in place for that time when the fat is in the fire. When a drastic time sets in, you hope that you don't have a spring-loaded character on your hands.  Just look at how Bush and his posse reacted. What set off World War I? We now have, because of the UN, a way to deal with the Hitler's and the Stalin's. The slow and deliberate kills, you know. Bush doesn't want a debating society, so he reacts. Without the use of an international institution, the future may not be capable of dealing with the war and anarchy that he and his lot have helped to bring. But it seems that we are all urged into a flux, and warring nations are coming together, and breaking apart, and some just don't know what to do. To get everyone to cooperate on both sides of the world, is imperative. It seems we are now having to come to the hope that the Americans can pull together and become stronger as a nation, regardless of what happens in their election. As Canadians we should feel that we may becoming very much isolated from the States, now. As my Bolognese friend Rita says of that country, "Hard to go. Easy to leave." She's leaving for NYC at the end of the month. She says now that if she known it was going to be that much trouble to go, she would have stayed here in Ottawa. But before she leaves at the end of the month, she's helping to put together a film premier at the the Ottawa Public Library.  That's the way it should be done, my friends. Learn a skill. Show it off to all those you know, and those who would like to know you. Show off the goods with what you got, and fuck the consequences, eh?  It's great though, to see the art world fighting back. Folk songs don't to seem to have as much of the singy songiness effect as it did in the 1960's. Even in these media saturated imes, loud heavy metal-industrial bands like stalwarts Ministry can't be lound enough to get anyone's attention. But they are not alone. One nail on a nail bed hurts. Hundreds of them gives you quite a nice cushion. The art world is desperately fighting back against the waywardness of a country whose government is conducting it's business in a shadey manner sending a great democratic institution on a rollercoaster ride. So let's listen up, or we'll be dealing with an massive influx of out of work Americans looking to sell a story.  There are several decent documentaries out there that have been making more headway for the genre of documentaries and it's producers, directors, writers, and other affected people that try to get into the gory details of our current state of affairs, making Michael Moore look like a boyscout. There's award-winner  urlLink Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me,"  where gluttony and this continent's faith in fast food dining is taken to greater proportions. In terms of making a documetary, Spurlock's approach is just gross. Robert Greenwald's  urlLink "Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"  takes a crack at dichotomizing the "Fair and Balance" approach to journalism that the network claims to provide to it's viewers, those lacklustre inbreds who tend to think in an unreasonably skewed view of things.  Here in Ottawa, Carleton OPIRG and the Ottawa Public Library, will be host to a special treat. A premier will be taking place Monday, August 23 at the public library on Albert St. featuring a film by American Christine Rose called  urlLink "Liberty Bound: A US Citizen's journey of discovery into the lies, oppression, and corruption that has invaded her country since 9/11."  Possibly a movie that will lend a more of a heavyhanded approach than Michael Moore's own pretty tough foray into the heart of the American Nightmare. Because Moore seems to have had to relax his smarminess to a certain degree in a tactical maneuver. The watering down of his movie, so that right wing loonies can't write him off as a eunuch, shows that were not quite there, yet. Now "Fahrenheit" and "Liberty" are movies of a seemingly parallel wish: to "Get Bush Out."  As Canadians, there isn't really much we can do for the American's but hope that Bush get's voted out, and that Kerry can show that he is any better. We can help them out by showing that we will see their best work in our little Seat of Power town, where opinions should be heard (as anyplace should.) Let them into the country so that they may go back saying, "Well, the Canadians liked my stuff. That should count for something... or , pay for something anyway. Now I can go ahead with the next project and do this touring thing all over again and hit it harder, faster, and smarter on all sides."  Documentaries as punk-rock, eh? What could be better than that?
