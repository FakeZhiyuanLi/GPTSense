      Yesterday we did our weekly lab. For this one we had to determine focal lengths for two different lenses. I liked this lab alot because&nbsp;our results came out pretty accurate and it was really cool. While we were doing the lab, two guys from the D&C took pictures and interviewed us. After lunch, i met with Dr. Baum and her husband. They further explained to me their project and why they are studying active galactic nuclei. I learned about the theory they are trying to prove, that all AGN galaxies are essentially the same, but appear different because of the different angles we are viewing&nbsp;them from. After the meeting, i continued working on my list.

      Yesterday we took a field trip to the Eastman KodakResearch building. I thought it was very informational and for the most part interesting. We learned about facial recognition software, image recognition software, different types of printers and scanners, 3-d imaging, and OLED screens. I thought the idea of machines being able to recognize whats in photos so they could sort them for the customer and adapt their processes, was really cool. I think it is amazing that people know how to use math and computer programming to make a machine almost intelligent. I wish i could have seen some of the math behind it and the actual programming. The OLED screens were also neat. I can't believe how thin they are and how sharp the image looks.

      Monday i&nbsp;worked on the bibliographic list all day again, and finally finished it and emailed it to Dr. Baum. I had to use a different database to find some of the lesser know sources, but managed to get all the information. I visited ally down in the basement when i went to get some hot chocolate from the machine, and she showed me the tests, and data she was working with. She was doing something with beads in different sized cylinders and computing ratios. I think she was modeling different types of soil.

      On Friday, Dr. Baum didn't come into work because she was sick, but she emailed me some stuff to do. I have to make another list of references to all the sources she wants to look at. This list will be exactly the same as the one i made for Dr. Kastner. I am learning to make better judgements about which&nbsp;references to include this time, because often there are more than 100 for a given source. Therefore, i have to pick in choose which ones to use. This task is time consuming, and includes ALOT of copying from the internet and pasting into word documents, but i do get to see some interesting papers. Hopefully Dr. Baum will return today.

      I had an extremely productive day yesterday. I decided to&nbsp;do a six hour day with no lunch break because i had to leave for a doctor's appointment at 2:30.&nbsp;I got a ton of work done in this time. In the morning i met with Dr. Baum and we talked about the progress i was making on the lists. I finished them them that afternoon and emailed them to her. i have become quite the expert at excel these last few weeks. We were supposed to take a tour of the physics department later that day, but the guy who was giving it never showed up. Since my work was completed, and i was leaving in 20 minutes, i walked over to the recreation center to try and get my card activated so i would be able to play raquetball. Something is wrong though and apparently we are still not on the system.

      I didn't do much work on my lists yesterday, but it was still a productive day. In the morning, Dave's dad gave us a tour of the Engineering Department, mostly the Electrical Engineering part. I learned about all the opportunites that RIT offers its Engineering majors. I also got to see a lot of really cool machines and equipment and talk to some of the professors. Even though I'm pretty sure Electrical Engineering is not for me, it was still very interesting and informative. I loved watching the people making the computer chips in the little contained rooms. After a fun lunch, i worked for a little&nbsp;bit on my lists, but then went out to volleyball.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Yesterday was another one of the famous tuesdays at the Imaging center. Usually tuesdays are really fun because we do a lab for most of the morning, then we go out to lunch or "in to the world" as sarah calls it, and then we play volleyball in the afternoon. It was stormy out yesterday, so there was no volleyball, but it was still a good day. I worked a lot on the list of images for Dr. Baum. She taught me an easier way to use the Space Telescope Data Archives search, so it is going alot faster now and i am almost done. The lab we did yesterday was pretty cool. The directions were a little confusing, but my results were pretty accurate. I still wish there was a way to put the screens and objects in stands though, rather than just holding them in an approximate location. We went to DiBellas for lunch which was really good. I can't believe I had never been there. I am definitly going back sometime.

      I had a pretty busy day yesterday. First i met with Dr. Baum and she gave me a proposal for one of her projects to read. For the project, she wants to use Spitzer to look at active galactic nuclei to learn how they relate to the evolution of their galaxies. Seyfert galaxies are the nearest and brightest AGN galaxies, so&nbsp; those are the ones that wil be studied. My job right now is to look through the hubble space telescope archives and compile a list of images for all the seyfert galaxies that will be looked at in this project, 87 in all. Yesterday, I also went with Dr. Easton to visit the RIT observatory. They have two telescopes, 16'' and 12". He explained to me a little about how the computers and CCD cameras work and their history. I will hopefully get&nbsp; a chance to use them sometime.

      On Friday i spent more time looking at light curves. I found a star that looked like it could be a variable because of its unusual light curve, but later determined that this was just due to experimental error. Dr. Richmond taught me a little about CCDs&nbsp;and how with really bright stars, the measurements can some times get skewed because there is an overflow of photons. This was probably the source of the irregularity of my graph for this particular star.

      Yesterday i studied the light curves of many stars that Dr. Richmond had taken measurements for while measuring a known variable star. Light curves graph time versus magnitude, so they show if the star varies in brightness at all throughout the viewing period. If the curve is relatively straight, it is a normal star. If it has regular waves, it could be a variable star. Sometimes the curves have irregular shapes, and this usually just a result of experimental error. Most of the curves i looked at yesterday were pretty normal, but i did find one that looks like it could be a variable star. I looked up the coordinates on Aladin and Simbad, and it seems as if no one really knows anything about this star already, so i might have found a previously unknown variable. This would be really cool. To be sure, i have to wait for another clear night so we can get more measurements of this star using different light filters. Then, if it is truly and variable, it can be reported!

      Yesterday started off pretty boring. I didn't really have any work to do in the morning, so i kept sara company in her little room, read a little more from Dr. Richmonds course notes, and saw a short presentation on visual perception. The presentation was really neat. I was shown all these pictures that played tricks on my eyes, and i couldnt believe what i was seeing, or what i thought i was seeing rather. For lunch, we had pizza on the department and watched some videos on color science. I learned how scientists use spectral graphs to match colors. The first video was quite interesting, but by the middle of the second one, my attention was dwindling. That afternoon i got some work from Dr. Richmond. He told me to check all these stars' light curves to see if they are variable stars. So far i haven't found any, other then the one he already knew about, but he says there is actually a good chance i might. I will probably be working on that for most of the day.

      Yesterday i got started on the reading that Dr. Richmond gave me. I went to the website for "Backyard Astrophsics" and read about the project. I then read the course notes from Dr. Richmonds class "Observational Astronomy". I found these really interesting and helpful. In the afternoon i played volleyball with the rest of the department. It was alot of fun, but my team lost a lot. (ahem...sarah...ahem...cough)...haha, just kidding.

      Today i finished finding all the references using Simbad. I then took some time to read Dr. Kastners papers. I learned about how he created a way of sorting through sources of X-rays from star clusters. It was hard for me to understand all of it, because i don't know enough about astronomy. There was not a whole lot for me to do that afternoon so i helped the remote sensing interns to research death valley rocks. We didn' t have much luck. Later that day, Dr. Richmond introduced himself to me and talked to me about his joh and experiences as an astronomer. I learned that there are two branches of astronomy: theoretical and observational. He is an observational astronomer and offered to give me work if i need it (which i do). He said that i can help him use the telescopes to take pictures of variabl stars and evenutally learn to do it myself. This sounds very exciting to me. Helping him with his data collecting of variable stars may eventually come a big project for me this summer. I can't wait.....VOLLEYBALL TODAY!!!!

      Today I started the final part of my task for Dr. Kastner. I learned how to use Simbad, and online site where you can find published papers that reference astronomical objects, different astronomy subjects, and that have different authors. Using Simbad, i have to look up every one of my 66 stars and collect and references and measurements of it. This took a while, and i still have a few left to finish today.

      Yesterday I finally got to meet with my supervisor for the summer, Dr. Steffi Baum. She was extremely nice and helpful and was able to get me a copy of the proposal for Dr. Kastner's project. I finally was able to learn the purpose of my work. I found out that images I have been downloading and pouring over are a collection of mass-losing evolved stars from the Large Magallanic Cloud. He wants to use Spitzer to take infrared pictures of the stars to learn more about late stage stellar evolution by looking at the chemistry of the "envelope" surrounding the stars. Now that I know this general information, my work is a lot more interesting. I finally finished checking all the images yesterday and taking notes on my observations for Dr. Kastner. Today I will begin the final part of my task, which is collecting references that are already published on the 66 stars.

      Yesterday was more of the same for me. I spent the day in the computer lab. I did learn how to use the ds9 software to look at the images I downloaded. It was very interesting to see how some stars showed up in only certain bands. I have to go through each of the 66 sources and determine if there is a star there. I am documenting what I find in some notes for Dr. Kastner. I should finish this later today.

      My first day yesterday was mostly orientation. We toured the Imaging Science building, went to the Red Barn, and met everyone. At the end of the day I met two of the undergrad students who are working with the resident astronomer Joel Kastner.Since Joel is away until the 18th, Rachel and Samantha helped me get started with my work. He is working on a project to find out if a bunch of stars have a smaller companion stars which are causing them to appear to emit infrared rays (at least i think this is what is going on...i still don't fully understand).To do this, he is using the Spitzer telescope which is one of four large orbiting telescopes which make up a program of NASA. It takes pictures using an infrared camera. I learned how to use Unix and then had to download images taken by the Spitzer telescope of 66 stars to create a library of images. This was kind of tedious work because it takes a long time to enter in the coordinates of each star, but it wasn't bad and I learned a lot, even though i still don't quite understand what is going on. Hopefully things will begin to make more sense soon!

      Yesterday was my first day back for a week and a half. It was a little hard getting back into the work routine after vacation. I spent most of the day working on my powerpoint presentation. I am no longer as nervous about giving it  now that I see that i actually do have a lot to talk about. Still....15 minutes is as long time. Today is the undergrad presentation day, so i will probably go to them for most of the day.

      On monday i finished organizing the image list for Dr. Baum. She took me out to lunch so i could kind of pick her brain for information about her college experience. She went to harvard and university of maryland, two schools i am very interested in, and was able to give me a good perspective as a student athlete. I am very lucky to have her as a resource. That afternoon, Dr. Richmond gave me some of the data he collected from observing the star that i found to be varying. I made a graph using this data, and it again showed variability throughout the night in the magnitude of the star. Dr. Richomd suspects that this might be due to an issue of color. If this star happens to be a different color star then the other stars around it, the results might be skewed. Dr. Richmond is going to check this soon, so i may know whether or not this star is normal or really a variable star. I won't be back into work until the 11th- vacation time!!!

      On thursday, i worked on rearranging the list of images for Dr. Baum. She wants me to put them in order by what kind of filter and instrument was used. Then she wanted me to sum the exposure times and also include that in the list. This is taking me a while to do. I have learned how to alphabetize spreadsheets on excel and how to use the sum function. We had volleyball that afternoon and then i left a little early because I was leaving for ESG's that night.
