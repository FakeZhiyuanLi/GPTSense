      Listen. I know we were close. I know we thought this would last forever. But truthfully, I'm seeing someone else.     My cellphone.    I know I vowed to keep you in my heart until the end of time, but you just can't compete with my shiny new cellphone. Plus, you're never around. He's with me always. Even in the bathroom. You just sit here and expect me to come to you. I'm giving in this relationship and all you ever do is take. Take. Take. I'm sorry, babe.  We had good times. I know we did. We had lots of cool friends too. But you know what? They all left us. Why? Because they could see through our shining smiling happy front. They could see the problems that lay underneath it all. All those time I tried to update and you were "under maintenance". Seriously...why were you  under  maintenance anyway?   So this is it. The tribe has spoken. I thought I loved you, but I guess not as much as my new shiny new Sony Ericsson cellphone. I mean, even his name is cuter. Sony Ericsson. What's yours? 'Blogger' Oooh...spiffy.   Goodbye blog. I won't forget the times that we had. The stories that we wrote. The lyrics that we shared. The comments we'd laugh over. The pictures we'd post. Honestly. you've taught me a lot. You taught me html. I'll keep you in my heart forever. Just not as close as my shiny new cellphone.   Love,  Parisa   p.s. -- stay tuned for a new blog/journal/diary thing coming to computers near you. =)

      There are times I find myself staring at someone; someone in a bookstore, on tv, walking down the street, and I am mesmerized by the expressiveness of their elocution. It draws me in, somehow, and often times I wonder about this delicate art form and the subtleties in it. The beautiful grace of the arms. The wrists. The hands. Those slender fingers.   Her fingers. Her beautiful fingers. I could watch her, gracefully applying lotion onto those beautiful hands, for years and years and years. Meticulously rubbing her hands together with the graceful slinkyness of a sleek egyptian cat. Those beautiful, beautiful, satin-like hands. Perfection could be found in those hands. Happiness. Her hands, and only her hands.

      what if I want to be a painter    or writer        or artist            or movie star              or maybe... I want to be nothing at all. Maybe I'll be a lawyer    or activist        or a business woman            always  busy-busy-busy or maybe... I'll be all of my deepest desires and darkest secrets and secret admirers and forgotten keepers. But then again if I promise now to be something somewhere someday...maybe I'll be signing my life, my freedom, my everything to chains in dungeons    where it's cold       under         the ground. 6 ft.

      The kid next door stole your name.  I heard his mother calling him today and it made me shiver, hearing your name again after so long. I felt numb and faint as I stumbled blindly over to my bed, reaching under the massive block, pulling out the tattered box of heartache. Opening it to remind myself of the pain I've been through, the hell, the heartbreak.   I need to remind myself of all that is horrible in love. I need to wash you off of me. Your scent lingers in my mind, my bed, my life. Your voice echos in my ears, in the empty membrane of my mind, your smile hovers in every empty picture frame. Yes, I need to wash you out of my life once again.   I sigh and push the box back under my bed.

      Around you has always been a place where I can think. The quiet has never been awkward; it has wrapped us in its warm arms and bestowed a quiet solitude more fulfilling than all the chatter the world can offer. Around you I'm happing being quiet, I'm happy dreaming about my future, our future, I'm happy listening to your heartbeat with my head upon your chest. I love holding your hands and peering at your fingers. They are long and thin and graceful with broad yet slender fingernails, an exact opposite of my short fingers and masculine nails that are broad and short and constantly breaking. I love your hands. Perfection could be found in those hands.

      Nine years ago I wouldn't have known the smell of the ocean. Nine years ago I never would have known the feeling of the ocean spray upon my skin. Most importantly, nine years ago, I wouldn't have known you.  Getting over you was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. Can you blame me?    Perfection Is English 12   -Having lots of money - nope -Reaching all of your goals in life - nope -Health - nope -Happiness - nope -Something flawless and beautiful - nope - You

      I'm in a rare kind of happy mood. The kind where you blast music, enjoy your morning, sniff coffee, put on makeup and your fanciest clothes, dance around and jump on the furniture. The kind where you're happy to be you, at that age, at that moment. The kind where you don't give a damn about anything going on in French, about homework, about war, about life. You just play. Be you for a day, the little you, the person we are all forgetting to be...     How different everything was last year...

      I'm realizing that by being totally open and nonjudgemental, I'm associating with so many new people these days. People I thought were just douche bags to begin with, suddenly are even bigger douche bags.   Go figure.   On a happier note...    I want to go to the movies. I want to go to Santana Row. I want to go driving with someone to the mission hills. I want to fall in love. I want to take a bubble bath. I want to go skiing. I want to live all alone. I want to find a really really really close friend. I want to change my identity for a day. I want to be famous. I want to be wanted. I want to be happy.   But I need---    to finish my homework.

      Well, it's been a bit, and I'm sorry. Except not. I am now officially done with one of my five end of the year projects for school. Just ONE. FUCK.    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh.    On a lighter note, I want to go back to Berkeley and see Love Me If You Dare and Before Sunset and The Corporation and that movie about the drugs. And...Harry Potter. Just not at Berkeley...   I'll post something more meaningful one of these years.

       Charlie Kaufman:  [voice-over] Do I have an original thought in my head? My bald head. Maybe if I were happier my hair wouldn't be falling out. Life is short. I need to make the most of it. Today is the first day of the rest of my life. I'm a walking clichÂ». I really need to go to the doctor and have my leg checked. There's something wrong. A bump. The dentist called again. I'm way overdue. If I stop putting things off I would be happier. All I do is sit on my fat ass. If my ass wasn't fat I would be happier. I wouldn't have to wear these shirts with the tails out all the time. Like that's fooling anyone. Fat ass. I should start jogging again. Five miles a day. Really do it this time. Maybe rock climbing. I need to turn my life around. What do I need to do? I need to fall in love. I need to have a girlfriend. I need to read more and prove myself. What if I learned Russian or something, or took up an instrument. I could speak Chinese. I'd be the screenwriter who speaks Chinese and plays the oboe. That would be cool. I should get my hair cut short. Stop trying to fool myself and everyone else into thinking I have a full head of hair. How pathetic is that. Just be real. Confident. Isn't that what women are attracted to? Men don't have to be attractive. But that's not true. Especially these days. Almost as much pressure on men as there is on women these days. Why should I be made to feel I have to apologize for my existence? Maybe it's my brain chemistry. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. Bad chemistry. All my problems and anxiety can be reduced to a chemical imbalance or some kind of misfiring synapses. I need to get help for that. But I'll still be ugly though. Nothing's going to change that.     go watch it.

      So after going back and re-reading all of my poems and songs, I've decided that I am going to stop writing them.      Do not waste your time being artistic, it won't get you anywhere important in life.     I am going to take my own advice, and apply that to fashion, sketching, writing, singing--everything artistic. Watch me become boring. Pllth...

      "...one in three people spend less time talking to friends and family because they can text and e-mail, and 46 percent of Britons would send a text message to avoid "wasting" time by having a conversation."   I find that when speaking to people mostly online, I find it difficult to interact with them effectively in person. I feel less bold and less confident. Interesting how technology is destroying our communication skills...

      you cried when she left and my heart wept for you scalding tears full of heft I did all I could to hold you  I walked for hours and hours And hoped to find your window Youâve told me so many times but this time I had to know  if you still pray in everyway that sheâll return again someday look for that girl with a heart that cries and beg her again to hide her lies and I will be forlorn and I will be forlorn  cry on my shoulder, and smile once more my heart will never be forsworn I know Iâm always so insecure But I never matter anymore

      I'm like a puppy,    I lap around happy and giddy. You tell me to leave, and I leave,    tell me to come back, I do. If I'm ever sad, pet me and I'll feel better,    like any good doggy would.  I'm like a fucking bitch.

      "In St. Louis, I opened for Barenaked Ladies at this huge arena, and there were these guys in front of the stage yelling 'faggot'. (pause) It was just weird, because that had never happened before and I was unprepared. Plus, I didn't have my  faggot-y redneck-repellant gear  on that day!"  "Frank Sinatra has passed on the torch to me. but little did he know that  he'd be passing it on to a  gay opera queen "   "I've developed into quite a swan. I'm one of those people that will probably look better and better as I get older, until I drop dead of beauty."   "All of you girly singing boys: Come out of the woodwork. Don't be scared, it's OK, you can sing. We'll start some sort of  war between the gangsta rappers and the little singing boys."   "I really fall for straight guys...I almost like it more. This is terrible but basically, I just don't want to be married. Unless it's really exciting. I just like the thrill of the chase more than getting the prize itself.  I like to be a bit of the shit disturber...the home wrecker, the whore, the bad guy. "  "Wait , hold on, I gotta start the bridge again, I forgot the words. uh.  cause  I was thinking of the naked boy ."   "This is about forbidden love of  cowboys, cause you know they're all fucking each other, the minute you turn your back."   "But Sting's 16-year-old son is so gorgeous - he brought him out last night - now  I'm dying to be friends with Sting so I can molest his children "   "I was in the forest jumping around daffodils while everyone was high on heroin."   "I usually wake up around three and  sit at the piano completely naked  and play for two or three hours. That gets the juices flowing. Then I dress and go eat after starving myself. I wait until I'm completely delirious. I can't say that Twenty-third Street is my favorite area, so I'd walk with  my very low blood sugar all the way to Tompkins Square Park and,  on the edge of death, order some pirogue . It's a good way to stay thin."    "My butt doesn't HAVE any complaints"  - Rufus before singing 'Complainte de la Butte'  "I went to see Moulin Rouge last night and  I want to be in the sequel where Ewan McGregor realizes he's gay and we can do a duet together  on top of the Eiffel Tower or something."     What excites you the most?   "Looking at myself at a distance, naked, in a mirror: but only at a distance."    What is your favorite journey?   "Down some boy's pants!"    Where is the most exciting place you've ever had sex?   It was in a car and it was really good and the windows got all fogged up and that was kind of hot.     What would you most likely be arrested for doing?   Having sex in a car!    Which of your accomplishments are you most proud of?   I would have to say my hair.   Gotta love Rufus...

      So how is everybody's summer? Hopefully it has been a slight aberration from the boring yet chaotic (imagine that) tedium that we had grown SO fond of during the school year. I also hope all of you are tanning evenly and drinking plenty of water and exercising your probably atrophic muscles. Beware, those slightly protruding bellies that looked cute when you were two aren't so beautiful now! =P

      I find it odd hearing newly pubescent kids talk about shagging a girl or giving something or other to a guy. Wtf? Have I gotten old or slept through ages of social maturity? What the hell happened? I didn't understand the concept of a blow job until I read a book on Monica Lewinsky in the 9th grade. I found it, and still find it, and will always find it, quite repulsive. How could anyone bring themselves down to such a low, repulsive level? And these soi-disant "teens" (I use that word loosely, they were barely out of their diapers) I saw talking weren't even the trashy type. They were decent, preppily dressed, bubble gum chewing, happy-go-lucky, all american, you go team!, kind of "teens". Whaaat?   So I had an interview today. *whew* I'm soo glad it's over. I'm such a flibbertigibbet. I talk and talk and just...nonsensical gibberish (redundant, I know...) and just I feel like a fool, and from the inside I'm screaming SHUT UP, YOU IDIOT!! And from the outside I'm talking...talking...talking...AHHH...  I saw Jalaie in the mall today. Twice in three days? Lol...he's a shopper! I'm a returner. Go figure.  I find myself staring at people in public places from under the safe shades I so famously don. There's so much more to pulchritude than one would normally think. Wtf...pulchritude? I need to stop studying...

       inspiration doesn't come easily.            Give up the quest and let it come to you.    Cease to make decisions about anything and everything from your favorite color to the paramount impedimenta in life.    Do not hate. Do not love. Do not vow.    It is almost guaranteed that within five years whatever it is you have objurgated, loved, or sworn upon will changed. A "favorite" color will have changed twenty times. Sadly, the love of your life will change, too. And the pact you made back in your puerile years in elementary will most definitely flop. You    swore to be drug free    back in your sixth grade D.A.R.E. program. Just wait until you hit a low point in your life, your best friends might be a pack of marlboro lights.     Don't speak incessantly about your goals and ambitions. Don't reveal yourself to whomever asks. And never volunteer information about yourself. You'll find that often times, your dreams will be reflected in another person whom you don't care much about. Just    don't    do it.          Remain    mysterious .   That, however, does not mean serious. Laugh. Scream. Shout. Do not live each day like it is your last, because quite frankly if you knew you only had    one day to live   , you would most likely do outrageous things (ex:    have sex ,  get wasted ,  rob somewhere   ). Also--smile. Remaining mysterious doesn't mean you're a bitch. Smile, it's cute.          Stand out. Do not be ordinary, wherever it is you are. If at the beach, wear a swim suit made from seaweed--or none at all. Or wear you hair in a    mohawk    to your aunt's funeral. Or whilst simply wearing jeans and a tee-shirt to a football game, sport fifty bracelets on your left arm and    wear shoes the color of toilets    in antarctica. Or, find your own (probably more normal) ways of standing out.    Never conform  .        Swear.    Not around your parents, siblings, bosses, or anybody older    en gÃ©nÃ©ral   . Swear during midnight poker games or on girls night out.    Swear at shitty drivers  .       Be a martha-friggin-   bitch   . You deserve it sometimes. Cut off people while driving,    give them the finger   , and honk like a mad man.    Don't do it all the time. Just certain days. Tuesdays and Saturdays are good.       Fall in love with all kinds of    weirdo music    regardless   of the stereotypes, the trend, or what your friends are listening to. Learn how to play odd instruments like    wine glasses    or even the accordian.          Pretend like you are Celine Dion and    sing at the top of your lungs in your car, with the windows down   , of course. If you don't know the words, make them up. If you don't know the song, act like you do. And if the goddamn radio just doesn't work, make up your own    ode to life .       Don't fall into the traps the    soi distant hotshots    of the world have set for you.                          to: [you]--hopefully it will clarify.  sui generis , baby.
