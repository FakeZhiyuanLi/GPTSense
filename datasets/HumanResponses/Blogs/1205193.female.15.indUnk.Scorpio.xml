      Ahh the emotional roller coaster that i like to call my life. In the last 5 days my life has been going crazy.I remember a long time ago (a.k.a. monday) when everything was going right and i didnt think i'd have to worry about anything. But i was wrong. I found out the next day just how wrong i was. Tuesday after i got home i got an email from adam saying that he thought we should break up. I definitely didn't see that one coming. So for the rest of that night and all day wednesday i was depressed. Then on thursday i talked to him and we became close friends again so things were good . But then of course came valentine's day. I stayed at home watching sappy movies which, of course, reminded me of what i lost. So i sunk back into my depression and i still haven't gotten out of it. I never knew it was possible to miss someone this much. I still really love him and i always will. That's why it's so hard to let go.But i know i have to try. For his sake and mine. Well this is probably getting really annoying so imma go now. See ya later ~

      Well, all i have to say is you can tell your love life is screwed when you don't even know if you're going to your own semi...i mean i've been waiting for this all year and it's like the most important part of the year for me but i don't have a date for it and i doubt the fact that i will ever get one...and the thing is i really do not want to go by myself...do you know how depressing it would be being at your own semiformal knowing that you were only a third wheel, someone who couldn't get a date and everyone would probably have a lot more fun with their dates if you werent there?.. i thought so...well folks it looks like im gonna be stuck at home the night of my own semi while everyone else i know is there having fun without me...hey wait, thats the story of my life isnt it? everyone always having fun without me...so i guess there's no difference there...

      It took me over a month, but i finally realized that breaking up isn't really all that bad.I was watching Here On Earth last night and what she said at the end really got to me - It's true, some people go their whole  lives and never fall in love with someone who loves them back...At least i had that experience, even if it was only for a few months...and now even though i'll always love Adam, our breakup has made me remember the love i felt for someone before i met him...i pushed it to the back of my mind when i was with Adam, but being alone now made me remember it again...I don't know if you even know who you are, so i won't say your name right now...the one thing i have to say is if you do know or you at least think i might be talking about you and you're reading this right now then i want you to know i love you...i know you probably don't love me back and would probably never go out with me in a million years but hun i still want you to know how much i love you...that day, i don't know how many months ago (i think it was in june) when i sent you that poem i wrote you...that's what i was trying to tell you...i don't know if you really got my message...but even if you did i know you probably forgot all about it...so that's why i'm saying all this now...just plz write me an email ok? cuz i need to know what u think...i hope this won't ruin things between us...and if it screws up our friendship i'm sorry...i really am sorry :(

      I am so sorry about the last blog...i know how horrible it sounded when i look back on it now...i just needed a place to get all my anger and pain out instead of bottling it up inside of me...but now that's over and i'm feling a lot better...adam, i dont know how i would have gotten through this if it werent for you...you have helped me so much throughout this whole thing...most guys would have just walked away and never talked to me again...but you've alwayz stuck by me and did everything you could to help me... and i really want to thank you for that...i dont deserve a friend like you... you deserve so much better...but yet you alwayz stayed with me, and you're one of the best friends i ever had... so thank you... you dont know how much your friendship means to me...

      I don't even know what to say besides if you dont want to be sucked into my emotionally scarred world, then i would exit this ride right now, as quickly as possible cuz this roller coaster is gonna plummet downhill in a matter of seconds...For all you crazy people that are still here, buckle your seatbelts n hold on tight, the ride's about to begin... First of all i have no self confidence and no sense of self worth so if this sounds like im a little hard on myself, u know why...I have no sweet clue why i'm still even in this fukkin world...it's not like anyone wants me here n if i died tomorrow its not like anyone would fukkin care...they'd probably have a party to celebrate the fact that they'd never have to see or hear from me again...n i know it too... which brings me to the fact that i have no idea why i even have any friendz at all...its not like i deserve it, i dont deserve anyone...and i probably don't even have any real friends anywayz...people probably just pretend to like me because 1) they feel sorry for me or 2) they just dont wanna hurt me....i dont know why they'd even bother though cuz i aint worth shit...i deserve to be hurt and alone...i deserve every bad thing that happens to me...im a horrible person who doesnt even deserve to be living...im taking up valuable oxygen that could be used on people who actually deserve to breathe...i know i dont...and believe me, al my ex-boyfriends are very extrememly lucky that they dumped me and got rid of me...they didnt deserve to be tied down to me, and i know it ok? Oh yeah, and about Shannon...i deserve every single insult she throws at me n every mean thing she does to me...hey at least someone can see that im not worth hanging around with...well im gonna leave now...somebody kill me plz...

      Well, i'm finally in a good mood again...and happy...thats something i havent been in a while! but i am...so once again, its time for a round of thank you's...Kyle, thank you so much for your little pep talks and for always being here for me...youre so sweet...and most importantly thanks for making me promise to feel better about myself, it's actually working :) yay!  Scott, i am so glad i met you all those months ago, just being your best friend and seeing you get over all the problems you had last year helped me get over mine...so thanks hun...I cant even begin to single out any of my gurls, but they've all been there with me every step of the way, and they've all put up with me talkin sh!t about myself...so thank you all...And,last but not least, Jon, thank you for being my best friend for all these years....i cant believe that you've put up with me for over 4 years...so thank you for that...hopefully those guys will get over their anger at whatever you did and not try to beat you up...i cant stand the thought of you getting hurt...well actually, im gonna end this post now....its been fun...thank you all for listening..Ciao !~!

      Dammit...now i feel bad again...but somehow through all the tears i think Averil might be right...If i really like him a lot then i should just let him go...Kyle deserves a chance to go with someone he wants to go with...i really dont know what to do....hes the one i wanna go with n i love him so much...but i dont want him to just be going to make me happy...cuz that's unfair to him...but yet, it won't be right without him there...i'll be sitting there imagining what it could have been like, dreaming about spending the whole night in his arms...oh wow...it's gonna be heartbreaking...dammit...yes all my dreams always have to get shattered don't they...thats the story of my life...

      See....i told you all i wouldnt end up going to semi with Ross...i didnt think that was gonna be how it happened exactly but what can ya do right? holy crap this is so damn hard on me...im crying basically every day now...i never wanted to hurt ross...fukk...life would be so much damn easier if i died today or like disappeared off the face of the earth...yes, i know everyone might care at first, but then you'd all realize how much better off you were without me...Ross, you would be able to move on and be happy with someone else...and Kyle, i know you dont like me n i know u like someone else,so you could be with her without hurting me cuz i'd already be dead...and i wouldnt be around to annoy everyone else...yes life would be perfect without me in it...

      I am so proud of myself i actually did a major update for my site :) yay for me! i made a poll, a travel section, and an annoyances section...and surprisingly enough the annoyances section is my favorite...i mad it cuz i was annoyed at a certain person (who shall remain nameless for the purpose of preventing everyone form being mad at me)...anyways yes what really annoyed me that this person did yesterday was that she likes one of the same guys that i do...and yesterday she was going on and on about him and would not shut up...it's like do you have no damn concern for how i feel about him at all?! no. you only care about yourself...well screw you! im not takin your crap anymore...maybe i should just tell her some of the things he says to me...see how she feel then...she will get so jealous about what he thinks of me and how close me n him really are and probably get really pissed at me...well i dont even care...im not sacrificing my happiness for hers anymore...she can go to hell...

      It's been a while since i last wrote in this so i decided to make a point of doing it again...so here i go lol...well i have a date for my semi now thanks to Ross, but i really doubt that it's gonna work out...like i think he's gonna change his mind and cancel out on me...i dont think i'm the one he really wants to be there with, and he's just going with me cuz he can't go with her...and also i just have this really strong feeling that by the time semi rolls around i won't have a date anymore...but oh well that aint gonna stop me from going, even though it will SUCK being there by yourself...but oh well, its not like anyone would wanna go with me anyways...

High school's still going great, and i'm getting closer to Jon than ever before...he even kissed me! A lot is going on lately too..we have a concert for band on November 4th with B-wood n QC.. and my birthday is on November 18th! So anyways...on to my toughts lol. Today my dad n I went to sobeys..and i saw Scott n i was talking to him...which led me to realize that i really miss hanging around with him. I just feel lately our friendship is kinda slipping away thanks to the different schools and the fact that we never get to talk anymore...and that's really saddening. I remember how close we used to be back at good old B-wood, always hanging out n having a great time, n i miss that! God, we have so many amazing memories together..I wish there was a way that i could stop it from fading away. So Scott, if you're reading this, i miss hanging around with you a lot hun! you're the greatest!

      So, the first half of the school year is pretty much over, considering the fact that no one is going to show up tomorrow anyways. It's been fun. High school is so much different than Junior High, and in my eyes it's a lot better. But then again maybe my decision is influenced by my experiences last year. Well, regardless, high school has been great, and I've met so many great people. I wish I could have been able to say goodbe to everyone before I left for Dominican, but I wasn't. Oh well, I'll miss you all!! I still can't believe that Christmas is almost here. It's pretty unbelievable. But it's awesome. So i'll leave on that note. I hope your holiday is amazing. I'll write again soon. Ciao~ Mel

      Finally. Things are back to normal. I guess what I was doing was creating problems that weren't even there to begin with. I guess it's a bad habit that i've gotten into. But I'm definitely going to try and fix it. No more always assuming the worst. And I know that thanks to my last post you all probably began to think that the queen of darkness was back, but fear not! I'm not letting that crap happen again. Ever since I got back to high school things have been really awesome, and i've been happy. And i'm not letting that slip. My personal life is back on track now, Christmas is coming quickly, and i'm jet-setting it off to the Dominican Republic in 2 days. How could things get any better? Oh wait...I won Colonel Gray Idol! :) So yep. Everything's great and i'm loving high school...it's so much better that Grade 9 - The year from hell. But yeah. I'm not getting into that. I'm signing off now because I have to go. I'm writing this from the library and lunch is almost over.  So see you later everybody..and if I don't talk to you before Friday then Goodbye and Merry Christmas!!!

      Wow. I didn't know it would come down to this. I guess it kind of had to though since i've been having the most stressful week ever. I have three major projects due and report cards come out today. Go figure. I think all my teachers must be conspiring or something. Anyways to add to my week i'm tired as hell from having to get up for early band Monday AND Tuesday..and i'm just about ready to flip. And then there's my personal life, which, by the way, i screwed up too. What else is new. I've been so stressed out this week that i spent so much time worrying about my friendship with one of my friends slipping away that i didn't even stop to notice that my friend needed me. My friendship wasn't slipping away, they were just going through a rough time. And I wasn't there for them. And that makes me feel like a piece of Crap. I'm so sorry...

      My last weekend of freedom. Ah, the agony. I'm going to be spending most of next weekend studying for exams. But all that misery aside, i'd say this weekend was pretty well spent. And it was so long too, since wednesday n thursday school was cancelled and friday we were hardly there haha. Friday after we got out early, I went down to Jon's house and hung out with him for a while. It was wicked lol. Then I went home and did hardly anything all night. I talked to Jon on the phone a lot, and I researched ideas for my ancient history project. Saturday, I spent most of the day talking to Jon on the phone. Then at 9 me and Janalea went to the movies n saw Along Came Polly. It was a wicked movie n it was Hilarious!! Jon was supposed to come too but he found out he couldnt at the last minute. Today wasn't really all that fun, cuz I was working on my ancient history project..n thats probably what I'll be doing all night. But oh well. My weekend was awesome. But i'm out, gotta work on the project. C ya. Mel

       The education system is fucked.  I've come to realize that was true after what a friend of mine told me a couple days ago. You see, he quit a while ago to work full time. Just recently, he decided that he wanted to come back and was completely willing to. He went to talk to one of our vice principals at the gray, who shall remain nameless. He told my friend just to get his GED's insted of coming back. Oh wow, what lovely vice principals we have. There's something wrong with this fucking picture. What the hell kind of a vice principal would discourage someone from coming back to school?! Arent they supposed to want kids to get an education? This is corrupted. And obviously so is the education system. Yes my friends, this is screwed. But hey, don't get me wrong. Most of the teachers I know are some of the nicest people i've ever met. They genuinely care about us students. But every once in a while you get an idiot like the guy my friend talked to. Oh well. I guess it's time I lay off him and try to calm down.

      Ah, New Year's Day. I was going to go on a huge rant that I need to get out of my system, but I think I'll put that on hold at least until tomorrow. New Year's is supposed to be a time of reflection upon memories good and bad, and that's exactly what I intend on doing. This year was definitely filled with ups and downs. I think the first thing we remember about it was my being tortured by Shannon. That, and a few other things led to my depression. I struggled for months, and her always being around intensified it. Finally, she was kicked out of Birchwood, and with the help of my friends i began to start getting back to normal. I even traveled to Paris, France - one of the biggest events of my life. I was still depressed once in a while though, and Kyle noticed that and did everything he could to make me happy again. And finally he succeeded. I graduated in June, and had a great summer.  And then, comes the second milestone: My entrance into high school. I think we all know that was one thing that changed me for the better. I didn't quite know what to expect, but I definitely didn't have anything to worry about. I was very well accepted, and having so many new friends around made me prosper. I began to become more outgoing, and started to come out of my shell. And then of course, I was constantly growing closer and closer to Jon. I finally began to realize that he had feelings for me too, just as I'd always dreamed. I began spending a lot of time with him, and I think that was the final factor in me becoming the happiest i've ever been in my life. And last but not least, the final chapter in the year of 2003: My trip to the Dominican Republic. I just got back a couple days ago. It was extremely amazing. So anyways, that was my year of 2003 at a glance. I think it's pretty safe to say that, although it had a rough start, it was the best year i've ever had. I'm off now though, so Later. Mel

      Blah. I'm so sick right now it's not funny..I am better than I was yesterday though. But i'm sniffling and coughing all over the place. I feel like i'm dying lol...I have no energy whatsoever. But aside from that, i'm actually in a pretty good mood. Go figure. lol.. But the sickness is dominating and I'm too tired to think. I'll write again soon. Mel

      For once, I didn't get depressed on Valentine's day. I loved it. Yes, I did spend the whole night at home watching movies, as usual. So what was different, you might ask? I was happy. And that made a world of difference. I mean, I like such an amazing, sweet guy..and I know for sure that he likes me back. And secondly, I had a Valentine this year. Thanx Lucas :) Now, I know you might think that's corny, but it means something to me because I love Valentine's day, and this year I had a good one. And I've just been so happy lately..I haven't stopped smiling for the last like 3 or 4 weeks..aside from the one time I did cry..but that is a whole other story which I don't really feel like telling. But anyways I am truly happy. And it's all thanks to the one I fell for. Yes, we're not together, but for once that doesn't matter to me. Because he likes me back. And if we could be together we probably would be. So anyways.. I'm happy. That's basically my point. So i'll say adieu, and happy belated Valentine's day. Mel

      A lot happened since I wrote last. Exams are over, and I did well. I'm now in a new semester n 4 new courses. And I also really fell for someone new. And I think he likes me back too, so it's great. My 6 day weekend went great, I spent most of it at Birchwood. Then there's tonight. It definitely had its ups and downs. On the plus side, I got to spend quality time with my best friend, which hardly happens because of the different schools. And second, I got to meet two great people who I became good friends with. Christine n Trish, you guys are awesome lol. But unfortunately though, we had some things that werent good. First, Lucas n Ky both couldn't make it, so that sucked cuz we really wanted to see them. Second, Felich and I were walking between the mall n the theatre when a group of like 10 guys started whistling at us n shit, n they wouldnt leave us alone. Then, after the movie Me, Felich, n Christine had a really bad experience..i duno if i should say anything, but holy shit it was scary...Other than that, the night was great. Anyways, i have to go for now. LaTeR. ~Mel

      Whoo! I got my internet back...that took a while lol..I hate viruses haha...anyways..I can't really think of that much to say...It looks as if my plans for tonight might be dying away, which totally sucks.. I was really looking forward to it. But anyways...there's really only one other thing I have to say..I know in my last post, I said some things that I didn't mean to, and for that i'm really sorry...my words hurt someone close to me, and that was not what I intended..so yeah...I was just in a bad mood, and I apologize for it. Anyways i'm gonna go now. Be back soon. Ciao~ Mel

      It's been a while, and a lot's happened. I still haven't seen Jon since the whole incident with my dad, which really sucks. Other than that not much is new aside from this past week..Which was for the most part bad. I was sick for half of it..and I skinned both my knees..but it was emotions that pretty much dominated. I got hurt by the guy I liked..and I felt led on, although I know he didn't mean to do that. It just sort of happened. But don't get me wrong. This week had it's good points too. Like Band days for one, which was really fun..but unarguably the best parts of my week were the two days that I got to spend time with Ky..because I have such an amazing time when i'm with him, it's like I forget everything else. Funny isn't it, how Ky always seems to be the one who comes and rescues me every time I get hurt or depressed..he's my knight in shining armour:) lol. He can bring me out of anything and cheer me up no matter what! Anyways, I'm out. I'll try n write again soon Ciao~ Mel

      God that benefit concert was just what I needed to take my mind off of things...I started out the night horrile, as many of my friends know, but as the night went on I got happier and happier until I was the most hyper I've been in forever!!! MUAHAHAHHAHAHA! Holy outburst lol...i'm still hyper as hell n it's an hour later. Go Mel! lol anyways, It has come to my attention by a good friend of mine (namely Scott lol) that I have not blogged in a while, so VoIlA!! Here I am in the wonderful world of blog! lol..so here's the story of why I was in such a bad mood earlier...it's a story of betrayal, and it goes back to the beginning of a weekend not too long ago...oh wait. It was this weekend! So AnYwAyS, a bunch of us were together at a movie, and my so-called-friend (who shall remain nameless, to remove te risk of anyone getting mad at me) was with us..and she decided she was going to talk to the guy who's taking me to his semi this year, who was also with us. So first, she decided to ask him if he liked me, and he said only as a friend..and i don't care that she did that, because I already knew that...but then little miss bitch had the nerve to tell him to "keep his options open" which basically means that she was telling him to ditch me! And THEN, she had the nerve to tell me she said it, like she was rubbing it in my face. Ooh yes. Very nice "friend" I have, huh? Ohh, it's on now biatch, and i can be a bitch too if I want to...the claws are coming out now. MeOw! lmao...but yeah. I'm in such a good mood now that I just say screw her, she aint worth me even thinking about it. I'll just pretend she doesn't exist. And I am going to be positive about what happened. He'd never ditch me anyways. And yeah. The concert definitely made me see things in a different light. I had the time of my life, and I'm still sooo wired!!!! Haha Anna, you rock hun, you're always so hyper, and it rubbed off on me..and then Katrina caught it off of me! Lmao.  And there were sooooo many people I knew there, including a few that I hardly ever get to see anymore due to the different schools. You know what I think...There should be just ONE really big high school for Charlottetown...things would be so much easier if friends didn't have to get split up. Anyways, I have to go..Scott, Marilyn, April...It was so great seing you three again..and Scott, i'm glad you got your energy back and were in a good mood at the end of the concert just like I did.  ANyways, i'm gona sign off now. I promise to write again soon lmao. Ciao~ Mel

      Time really is of the essence. And i've decided that i'm simply not going to waste it anymore. I may feel somewhat bad not listening to my friends' advice of "give it time" but i just truly don't have time anymore. I 've got to get everything that I can do, done right now and not wait until it's too late. Once again, some of you will understand this, while the rest you will not know what I meant by this until sometime soon. But I just can't waste another moment, another chance. Life is just too short, and you never know what might happen. Wow. I sound so optimistic.

      I have come to the sudden conclusion that I just don't have enough fun anymore. Seriously. This year started out as a new phase for me. I was happy again and back to my old self, and I had even gotten a lot more outgoing and confident. Things were definitely looking up until lately. Something happened that changed all of that, and I just don't have the mindset anymore that tells me I can have fun again. For those of you who don't know what happened that made me get like this (which is a lot of you), i'm sorry but I can't tell you right now..just know that it's something horrible. And for the very few of you who actually do know what's going on..please help me have fun again. You know how important it is.

      And once again with the lies. How many more times does she think she can do this and get away with it? And how many times has she already done it and gotten away with it without me knowing? Yes, I guess it is sort of my fault that it's gotten this far. I haven't said anything to her about it, and therefore she thinks she's gotten away with it. And I gave her the benefit of the doubt, when I shouldn't have. But aside from that she has some major issues if she has nothing better to do than lie to me and screw things up for me. Because i'm simply not going to take it anymore. I don't appreciate being pushed to my limits, and i'm way past that right now. She needs to be taught a lesson. She picked the wrong person to fuck around with, and the wrong time to do it, because I just refuse to put up with anymore shit right now. I'm sorry, but i'm just telling it like it is. She's a bitch. That's all there is to it.

      Just when you think someone couldnt possibly get any worse than they already are- THEY DO. I seriously do not believe that stpid little bitch had the fucking nerve to do that to me..lie to my face and tell me that she lied over a month later, when things were already ruined! UGH! Well the trust is officialy gone, and it ain't ever coming back. I'm gonna go all Dorothy, and do some major wicked witch ass kicking..if my water bottle just happens to spill all over her today..it's so not my fault. It was just an accident! *bats eyelashes and looks innocent*. But don't worry. Water is the least of her worries..I intend to make her pay for it..I just have to think up some evil revenge schemes. Any ideas?

      I have officially broken tradition. Whoo!! I actually made it to early morning band practice on time (before mr. Jabbour even got there!)..and that pretty much dictated what the rest of my day would be like. I started out the day in a crappy mood and nervous...but after that everything went uphill. Band calmed my nerves, as usual. I got right into the music and forgot everything. My science test was actually pretty easy. At lunch we had the student council pizza party which I forgot completely about. My math test went by easily too. And then after school I went for a walk down to Birchwood to see my friends. So yeah, i'd say today actually went pretty well:)

      Well, this has been a pretty crappy long weekend. I did absolutely nothing interesting all weekend, and nothing happened to make the weekend worthwhile. Ugh. I'm in a pretty bad mood today. Everything just seems to get to me. And it sucks when one of your friends means so much more to you than you mean to them. But meh. It shoulda been obvious to me. This just hurts.

      Whoa. It's been over a month since I wrote anything in here, so I figure it's about time haha. My trip to Washington was amazing, I met so many new people, and got to stay with my old billets from 3 years ago, which was amazing cuz I missed them. It was awesome. Then, the day after I got back I had the french competition. Now THAT didn't go too well. I was so nervous I kept forgetting everything and could hardly finish my speech! And I ended up crying afterwards too. Yes, I know i'm emotional lol. But that's definitely something I want to forget. Then, the next week came "The Wiz"! The first time I went to see it with my school, and loved it so much that I went back again on Thursday night with Kyle and Kat. It was extremely well done, and I thought it was hilarious. Scott, I am so proud of you for your acting in it. You brought so much to it, and we could really tell how much you were into it. You truly had an outstanding performance! But anyways, that's all for now...don't wanna be late for school. Later~ Mel

Tonight I'm going to the concert down at the waterfront, and then *TOMORROW* is Canada Day! I'll probably go down to the rides sometime during the day, and then at 6 I'm going to le Partay for Lilly!! WHOO! So we shall stay there for a while, and then possibly go to the midway later on. And then, zee fireworks! I'm meeting Jon at 10, and then he's coming with us to watch them *smiles* It's gona be awesome! Anyways yeah. I'm gonna go now...I shall leave you with this hilarious converstaion that I had yesterday when I was with Jon and Kat...this proves just how ditzy I really am. So voila, here you go ---> Jon, as I walk up to him "Wicked fire.." Me "What? There's a fire?? Where?!" Jon "Uh...on your skirt." hahaha yes, Mel is a ditz..I was wearing my wrap skirt with flames on it, and it didn't register that that's what he meant. Go me.

      Well..At least i'm in a better mood today than I was yesterday. My talks with Steve sure helped a lot. Good old Steve..I missed him lol. And yeah. My Canada Day might not suck anymore, due to the fact that I found out you didn't have to be invited, it's just an invite yourself type of thing. So voila, I am now invited. lol. I still say it woulda been better with Scott around though. Speaking of Scott, his theory of giving things a day and they might get solved was actually pretty brilliant, and it worked for that problem. Now...if only it could work for the inevitable at the end of the summer..then I'd be fine again.. Scott, I really need to talk to you before you leave..If you read this then PLEASE call me...you know my number..this is extremely important!

      Blah. I'm so pissed off today. My Canada Day is going to suck ass. Everyone's either gonna be away, or they already have plans..And nobody tells me anything anymore. They just go ahead and make plans without me. I don't believe it.. when someone who's been my best friend since we were 3 or 4 (who moved away last year) is coming back to town for the summer, does anyone bother to tell me she'll be here for Canada Day? Nope, I would have gone on thinking she would still be in Ontario for a while..Jeez. I feel so damn left out. Peachy...Just fucking peachy.

I've been trying to get ahold of someone for the last week, and yet i've never been able to talk to them. And he leaves in a couple days. Talk about burn..I don't know what to do. This really sucks. But now I have to go. I'll write again later.

      Well. My plans for Canada Day have gone down the drain. Lol, it was gonna be so much like Grade 8, this huge outing and it was gonna be a blast. And I suppose I can still make it that way, but it sure won't be the same without Scott. But anyways. All this pressure because of the inevitable at the end of summer (yes, I still can't say what it is) is really effecting me. And I don't like it. I keep saying things I don't mean to, and pretty much acting like a bitch. And that is NOT a good thing. In fact I hate it. But yeah. I cant write much more right now, because my parents have given me 10 different chores to do today. I wonder how many hours that's gona take me *sighs* There goes my day..later~

      Bah. What a mood i'm in right now. It's strange lol. Part of me is miserable, but yet part of me is calm. I don't really know how to explain it. So I won't bother. Yeah. Today i'm just feeling like an annoyance. Not just to one person either, but to everyone. It's like I'm just a hassle to be around, and I feel like (although they will deny it if I ask) people are getting sick of me. But enough about that. I feel cheated by Birchwood haha. Yes, that's right, the school i'm still ever so attatched to. But seriously. While our end of the school year trip last year consisted of Rainbow Valley (Whoo..what a thrill *rolls eyes*), This year they went to MAGIC MOUNTAIN. So unfair!! So today while I wished I could at least go swimming, they were playing in wave pools and waterslides, or just chillin on the lazy river. But enough complaining. The french immersions deserved it, due to their Quebec trip being cancelled. And I hope everyone had fun! Oh well. Anyways I think that's it. I'm too tired to think of anything else to write right now. Ciao~

      God. I'm falling apart again. I don't know how much more I can take. I can't do anything right, not even enjoy my summer vacation. I'm supposed to be out having a blast with my friends, but while everyone else I know is doing that i'm sitting here thinking about how i'm going to lose it all. To quote the perfect line from a song "I took for granted all the times that I thought would last somehow". I mean god, why does this have to be happening to me...this year has brought me so much more than I ever asked for, so many bonds have been made, so many friendships that have been strengthened and restored. I've begun to get really close again with some of my old best friends that I lost somewhere along the way. I was truly happy again. And to have that all taken away from me and shattered...yeah, i'm having trouble dealing with that. I'm not saying that I can't have fun anymore, don't get me wrong there, because I can. But it just doesn't sustain me as long as it used to. I used to be able to sit there weeks later thinking "Whoa that was sure awesome." But now, when I think back it's always "wow..i'm gonna miss that". And it sucks. But I can't change the future. I guess all I can do is hope that this whole thing falls through, and that I won't be torn from my friends and everything that I love. God. What a depressing post.

      Man. I'm so bored today, It's a complete waste of summer just sitting inside doing nothing. But what else can you do when you're out in the middle of nowhere at your grandparent's? Urgh. But hey. I always have nothing to do, so what's the difference right? Anyways. Birchwood's graduation is on friday, and I plan to take a ton of pictures to make up for my lack of pictures taken at semi haha. Yes, I love my pics. So yeah. Nothing else really going on, due to the fact that school is over and I have no life. I can't wait til the Canada day celebrations start up again, with all the concerts and exhibition. And I plan on turning Canada day itself into a major outing, just like it was in Grade 8. Ah, the memories of running around hugging inflatable things, Scott being the "lost child" haha, us being extremely hyper, getting interviewed for the news (damn them not putting us on tv haha...we should sue.*Evil glare*), and the fireworks. Damn, I still can't believe my friends thought you were drunk Scott, AHAHAHAHAHA. Good times. And Canada day probably would have been a major outing in Grade 9 after Lilly's barbeque if I hadn't gone with Whit n Shawn to my house to get a sweater, and when we returned everyone had left without us lol because they heard we left for the rides. Oh well, that aside, I hope this year's Canada day shall compare to Grade 8...it'd have to be pretty damn good to do that:)

      Hey, sorry this post didn't come sooner, but I didn't have much downtime since semi. Which is what this post is all about! Semi was so amazing, I had a blast!! It stopped raining by 7, but only Ky, Lucas and I showed up at the waterfront and it was freezing, so the cold made us decide to just take our pictures at the delta. Oh god, I had such an amazing time at semi, it was magical and we danced the night away! I started the night so unlike myself though, I couldn't even manage to dance *gasps*! But Ky fixed that one...he took both my hands n started to dance, so that got me dancing lol. And he did that for all the fast songs n twirled me around n stuff...so yeah that was really fun. There was a lack of slow songs though, which was kind of cheap, but oh well. I seriously thought I was going to feel out of place at semi, but I didn't. And the night definitely had its hilarious moments..like my bracelet getting caught in my shawl about 5 times on the way there (i ditched the shawl once we were there), Me not being able to get out of Ky's car n him having to reach over n unlock the door haha ("My car is Mel-proof!" lmao), the dj asking "Birchwood guys, don't you think the ladies are looking fine tonight?!" n then complete silence haha (what a self esteem booster..stupid guys lol)...and many more completely hilarious moments lol. And then there was always the fact that all drunk people seemed to be attracted to me n Ky haha that was..interesting..and definitely strange lmao eh Ky? Ah, what a night it was, and I fully intend to have a page dedicated to it on my site, just as soon as I get enough pictures. Well, that's it for now, if you want to hear more about semi then just ask lol. Ciao~

      Woah. My hair looks amazing. It was well worth getting up early to be there at 9:45 in the morning haha. Semi is tonight!!! God the excitement is building up, i'm about to go crazy haha. I'm gonna be soo hyper tonight, and I shall dance the night away! Now, if it would only stop raining before 7:00 when Ky comes to pick me up, then everything would be peachy lol. It seriously better, the pictures by the water were so gorgeous last year, and I want the same this year. Stupid rain. Anyways. Enough about semi. My exams are over, they both went surprisingly well actually. Math didn't even seem like an exam, due to the break after the first hour, and all the food our teacher brought in for us to eat during the break and the exam. And it was really easy. Science was somewhat harder, but I knew most of it so it's all good. I went to watch people enter both Rural and Gray's prom, and it proved to be a fun experience, aside from my camera malfunctioning during part of Rural's. So Scott, if you're reading this, can you send me a copy of the picture with you and your dates under the archway? Thanx. Anyways I shall go now, so much to be done!! I shall write soon to let you know how things went. Ciao~ Mel

That was the rudest audience i've ever seen. But anyways yeah. That being done takes some pressure off of me. We had our pizza party, which was so much fun! I'm gonna muss drama. Last weeekend I went to Tyler's concert. Grade 10 Girls rock!!! They did really awesome, especially considering how cold they were lol. And yeah. School's almost over. Monday is my last day of class, but i'm not even sure if that's a full day, so today might be! I have my math exam Wednesday and Science Thursday, and then i'm done for the year!!! Whoo!! And semi's a week from tomorrow, so i'm sooooooo excited. I can't wait, it's gonna be amazing. But I better get going n do a little bit of studying before I go back to school n write my make-up test for math. Later~

      Damn. My last attempt at posting didn't work for some reason, so here's the update lol. I'm extremely hyper right now, and I don't even know what it is that's making me like this haha. But it's wicked!! I think it's the fact that I got my semi ticket today, so that just makes it feel more official that i'm going. Only 15 more days!! I can't wait lol. Anyways yeah. Exams are coming up, and I have what I consider my two worst ones- Math and Science. So to avoid stressing over that, I'm keeping myself busy until the inevitable studying has to start happening. Tommorow night Ty's band is playing down at the waterfront, and Tuesday night I have my own Drama performance. Which you all should come to. It's on Tuesday June 8 at 6:30pm in the Lecture Theatre at the Gray. I hope to see you all there!!! Ciao~

      Ugh. So much stress...Final exams are in less than a week, I've got 5 different scripts to memorize for drama, factor in all of the problems that Breanne has caused for me, and that's bad enough. But then there's my major problem. I still wish I could say what it is, but I can't. All I can say is that it's making me miserable, and there's nothing I can do to change it. Oh yeah. Life is just peachy. I don't know how much more I can handle right now. I can't stand the thought of losing everything. I can feel myself slipping again. I'm gonna get depressed again. I can tell. God dammit I hate whats happening to me..I guess I should try and think of the positive...but there isn't really any positive in this situation. So i'm going to try and focus my attention on semi, which is in 16 days. I can't wait, it will be amazing! Go Melanie lol, my 3rd Birchwood semiformal in a row...don't I feel like Ms. Popularity lol. Haha that's a laugh..me, popular? But it does feel good to be invited again. Anyways i'm out. Ciao~

       Alright, I've got some catching up to do.  Saturday night I went to the movies with Felich, Kristine, Kristen, Brent, and 4 of Fillie's cousins&nbsp;(2 guys, 2 girls)...at least i think they were all cousins...I know 2 of them were for sure. Anyways, we met at 7, and bought tickets for the late show of A Cinderella Story , which was at 9, So we had plenty of time to go to Le Midway. God I love being at the rides. Jon's right, I am an exhibition addict. So anyways, we went on the Avalanche, and after the first time around the guy stopped it and made everyone get off...I guess it was broken..so we could get on another ride free. Which kind of sucked because I love the avalanche, but oh well, we got a free ride on the himalaya so all is good. As soon as we got off the himilaya, the avalanche was working again. Stupid jerk. ahaha anyways...we stayed around for a while because some of the people we were with had more tickets to use...and then we went to the movie. It was awesome!! I'd say a good time was had by all...except when one of Fillie's cousins would not stop throwing popcorn, for which he got bitched at by a couple of the girls, and glared at by the rest of us lol. Especially me, since most of it hit me. Anyways yeah. I caught a cab home, and the driver that took me was wicked! He was talking to me and being really nice and joking around, and then he only charged me 5 bucks because I let him stop at the drive thru at McDonald's. So yeah. Good times. I don't even remember what I did on Sunday, or monday for that matter because it wasn't all that memorable. Tuesday was fun. I took a walk downtown, and bought an ice cream cone at a corner store and sounded like a ditz when I didn't know what to call a small ice cream cone (another one of those blonde days), and ran through the fountain...ahh, I feel like a kid again lol. And then we walked by Cows and I hid the ice cream and pretended not to have it because Brad was working and I didn't want him to see me with it ahah. Good times. Last night I took a walk downtown, and ran into a lot of people I know. I had talks with Vanessa, Robbie, and Jon, and I also saw Brad but Cows was busy so i didn't go in. And yeah. Today was awesome. I went to the beach with my family. I ran into Ryan MacMillan and talked to him for a bit, then I saw Janelle with some of her friends, and later I ran into Suzanne and some other girls from my school. And yeah. God I love the beach lol, it's so relaxing and awesome. I have to get a group of friends together soon and we can all go. Any takers?

       Yesterday was wicked. Jess, Tyler and I went to the mall and the midway. They picked me up at around 7:30, and we were cruisin down the highway blaring Aqua haha. Jess and I were singing along, we still knew every single word...ahhh, the old days :) I think Tyler thought we were crazy haha. Anyways yeah. The mall was great, I got a new shirt and it's AWESOME. I sure learned my lesson at the midway though...never eat a steak dinner before going on the Avalanche, no matter how long you wait lol. The avalanche was awesome, although it would have been so much better if I hadn't gotten sick afterwards. Words of wisdom - never go on the Himalaya by yourself. The guy wouldn't let me sit with Jess n Tyler, so I had to go on my own. That was the wildest ride of my life. I had to hang on for dear life because I though I was gona fall out ahaha. Anyways yeah. Today i'm trying to find some people to go swimming with me, but nobody is home. Which sucks. But i'm still in a good mood because SCOTT COMES HOME TODAY!! now if only I knew what time he came lol, then it'd be good. But oh well. Anyways yeah. You can all take this as a sign that i'm keeping my blog. I might make a livejournal anyways, but i'm not getting rid of this blog. Anyways, I'm gonna go outside now before dad comes home and I get in trouble for being inside on the computer. Later. Ciao~

      So bored. I spent the day outside reading lying on a blanket in the front yard. Pretty calming, but it made me even more tired than I already am. I'll probably go across the street to the campground later and see if anyone interesting is around. I don't know if Jennie will be there, but hey its worth a shot. Who knows, maybe i'll meet a couple hot guys along the way ;) haha. Anyways yeah. I made an account with livejournal today, but I don't know if i'm ever gonna use it. Maybe if people actually read this one, I might not switch over. But no one does anymore. I'm still debating.  If anyone's out there, let me know what you think.

      Blah. I think i'm about to fall asleep. I had to wake up this morning at  6:00AM  to go out to my grandparents at 7. My dad was bitching at me n my mom at around 6:15 because we weren't ready yet. Oh joy. Are you fucking insane? It's 6:00am in the summer. And it's not like we have to catch a flight or start a road trip, it's a half hour away. God I hate today. I also found out that THERE'S A MIDWAY IN THE CHARLOTTETOWN MALL PARKING LOT. Now why is this bad news, you may ask? Well, the answer to that question is simple. I LOVE MIDWAYS. Which is why it normally wouldn't be a bad thing. It would be amazing! But who knows how long it may be there? It could be gone in the next few days, and then I'd have to wait until August 12th to go on rides again. Blah. It better still be there when I get back. Anyways yeah. I'm ending this post now. It's not like anyone wants to hear me rant on in my bad mood. Ciao.

       Quite the interesting past few days.  Saturday night I went to the movies and saw the notebook, it was really good! I still haven't seen spiderman 2 though, so i'm still dying to see it soon...anyone feel like coming with me? Sunday I just stayed around home and didn't do much of anything. Yesterday was great, we headed out to the beach for the day, ad I had a lot of fun. I think today was the most interesting though. It started out good, and then turned into a crapfest. We started out by going to the beach, which I thought was a good start to the day. But that's where the fun ends. Yes, I did have a great time at the beach. But the rest of the day...yeah. First, I found out that Rock The Island is CANCELLED. I've been looking forward to this concert for months, ever since I heard about it. I mean, come on. An 11 hour concert with all these HUGE bands..it woulda been amazing. But now that's over and I have nothing to look forward to until Old home week, and then camp right after that. But that isn't until August 12th, so I have a long time until then to continue my uneventful, boring summer. Woo. So yeah..I was in a bad mood already...and then I found out that Scott is having a horrible time in Calgary, and now I feel bad for him, being stuck up there for almost 3 weeks with people who annoy the hell out of him. It would suck so badly. And to top it all off, I feel like i'm fading from not just one of my friends, but from a few of them now...i'm just not close with a lot of people anymore, and it's a piece of crap. It's also probably my fault too. Everything is. But anyways, i'm going to go now. I think I wrote all this for no good reason now anyways, because probably no one reads my blog anymore. Does anyone even read this?

      Alright so..It's been a while haha. The concerts were awesome, although it poured solid for the first 2 concerts. So yeah. The first one was fun. Not much else to say. Kat came to the second one with me, and we met up with Emma, Mira and Melissa. The first half was wicked, but I got separated from them for the second one. I ran into Emily, and she stayed with me and my mom. We stood in a tent when it started raining, which was good because it soon started to downpour, and then that turned to a full-blown thunder and lightning storm. It was crazy. I hope Steve didn't get sick, because he was stuck working outside for the first 2 concerts during all the rain. Anyways yeah. The 3rd concert was awesome! It stayed sunny, and the music was great. I also ran into Ty, which was cool cuz I don't see him too much. Anyways yeah. So then on Monday, my dad took me and my mom to Summerside for a Bruce Cockburn concert. It was fun. I ran into Emma and Mira there. So yeah. We stayed in a nice hotel for the night, and then came back. Wednesday, I had a pool party type thing at my house. It rocked!! Felich, Lucas, and Jess n Tyler came over. Jess n Tyler stayed til about 5:30, n then they left. Me, Felich n Lucas all went to DQ at 6:20 n got ice cream. Then Lucas's mom picked him up at like 6:45, and me n Felich went for a walk downtown. We even ran through the fountain on victoria row! lol. And I also had a much needed conversation with Jon. Then Felich and I went back to my house and she stayed until about 9. Yesterday I didn't do much except go for a walk with Krystle. And I also took my semi pictures in!!! And the pics from before Rural's and Gray's proms..and my grade 9 grad pics haha. So yeah. Can't wait to get them back! But i'm gonna go now. Ciao~

       My Canada Day.  During the day Kat and I went down to the waterfront at about 1:30 to take in all the free stuff, and then at 3:40 A.n.I played. They rocked! Afterwards we wandered around randomly to try and find people and then finally WE FOUND LILLY!!!!! Tehehe...so Me, Kat, Lilly, Jen, Jennie, Megan and Nathan all hung out down there til I went home at about 4:45 to eat before the party! So I left for Megan's house after I was done, and I ran into Jon on the way at about 6...and he tried to pretend like he wasnt drinking when I saw him hide the beer bottle ahaha..so we had a somewhat amusing conversation, and then I left to go to the party..so I got there n there was like 15 people there lol...so we all hung around n got pizza n stuff...n the pizza took so damn long to get there because the stupid delivery guy got lost...oh yes, because we all know Prince st. is hard to find hahaha. At about 8 we headed down to the waterfront, and Whit n I decided we wanted to go on some rides...so the two of us and Adam n Mark headed to the midway, but no one else followed lol. We went on a few rides, and the Roundup is AMAZING!! Or the "spinny thing" as everyone likes to call it haha. Mark left us, but we acquired Katie and Katrina. I left them n went to the midway to find Jon..n I ran into Matt (his brother) and we had a very...interesting talk haha...Yes, Matt loves to play the older brother to me. After not finding Jon, I went back to the other part across the street with Whit n all them n we went back to the midway (yes, it was a lot of walking for me). We went on a couple rides, and then I saw Jon. I had to try n keep up with him though, which was extremely hard. Along the way Felich found me, and together we actually tracked down Jon! Unfortunately, He was drunk as hell and could hardly walk..which was kind of funny, i'll admit..but drunk people get lost too easily..so yes, all my efforts were for nothing and we lost him. Felich, Brent and I watched the fireworks, and I felt so alone being there with just a couple. And yeah. Then Felich n Brent walked me home.
