       do u know catwoman ?  if u dont ,U better know about it history.  according to the report of  urlLink GameSpy &nbsp;:  she was a poor woman. and she was dead after Break down of window..  After she's killed, she's brought back to life by some cats,and also give her more powers. and she look like a cat. She change to CATWOMAN !!!!  Apparently, these powers don't include the power to control the game's camera, which is the title's biggest weak point. Much of the game involves making Catwoman climb up the sides of buildings, jump across open spaces, or swing from various anchor points using her favorite weapon, the whip. Alas, the game's fixed camera makes most of these actions feel like chores, as there are plenty of times when you can't see where you are supposed to go. Jumping across gaps is particularly hard, since you can't center the camera to line up your leap. ...    Developer : Electronic Arts UK /  urlLink Argonaut Games   Publisher :&nbsp;  urlLink Electronic Arts   GameSpy Score : N/A  Multiplayer  for more information U can Visit urlLink  here .  this game is a&nbsp;Xbox Game.

       Some CEOs just don't know how to retire. When Michael Dell officially hands over the chief executive officer title to long-time prot駩 Kevin Rollins at the company's annual shareholder meeting Friday, nobody is expecting a re-invention of the US$41 billion computer company. Rollins's take-over is so low key that a tongue-in-cheek corporate video circulating at the company's Round Rock, Texas, campus shows Dell's new chief executive watering the plants, flipping burgers and sorting company mail during his first day on the job.... for more information u can visit :   urlLink ITworld.com : "After 20 years, Dell looks at future"
