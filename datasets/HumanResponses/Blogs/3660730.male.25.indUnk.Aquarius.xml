         There is a moment in  Fahrenheit 9/11  that speaks volumes about the current political zeitgeist in America.  Lila Lipscombe, a mother whose oldest son was killed in Iraq, goes to Washington, D.C. and plans on walking past the White House, just to see it, just to be near the man who sent her son off to die.  Ms. Lipscombe happens by a woman sitting on the sidewalk, protesting the war.  She has pictures of the atrocities that have been commited there.  "Bush is a terrorist," the woman says.  Lila connects with this woman, telling her about the death of her son.  In the middle of this connection, a third woman passes by.  The instant this third woman gets a glimpse of the protestor's set-up, she becomes hostile, treating the whole scene like one big nuicance, like there could not possibly be any validity to what she is saying.  It is not just that this woman disagrees, but that she disagrees so vehemently.  After telling this woman about her son, Lila just walks away.  Moments later, she tells us how frustrated she is by the ignorance of most people.  "People think they know, but they don't," she says.  "I used to think I knew."   Fahrenheit 9/11  is all about dispensing with what you think you know.  Never one to shy from controversy,  urlLink Michael Moore  seems to invite it.  His methods have frequently been called into question, and his films have a tendency to venture into the exploitive.  His ambush of Charlton Heston at the end of   urlLink Bowling for Columbine   is typical of the lengths he will go to for his films.  But he does raise important questions, and with  Fahrenheit 9/11 , he forces us to look at the power structure in this country as few "news" outlets ever have.  Over and over we see Bush saying that we need to liberate Iraq, that they are living under a brutal dictator who "hates freedom."  At the same time, Moore connects the dots and shows the Bush families connection to the House of Saud, with George H.W. Bush even referring to them as friends at one point.  What Moore hits on, and what is almost never talked about anywhere else, is that Saudi Arabia is itself a dictatorship, a country with public beheadings that has a reputation of human rights abuses.  Why we would be aligned with one country (a country from which 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from), and the enemy of another is a question that perhaps only the Bush family can answer.  The Bush/Saudi connection that Moore makes is the strongest, most compelling part of the film.  The extent to which the Saudis are invested in this country is mind boggling.  The connection goes so deep, in fact, that Moore cannot even stand on teh street in front of the Saudi embassy without the Secret Service coming over to question him.  "Do all foreign diplomats get this kind of protection," Moore asks.  "Very few," says the officer.  When Moore asks if the Saudis ever give them any trouble, the officer gives a quick "no comment" and hurries off.  How interesting that not only were the Saudi diplomats flown out of the country after 9/11, but when they are in the country, they get the same protection as any sitting president.  Moore asks the most compelling question: if the country is paying a man $400,000 a year to be their president, and another group is paying the same man's family $1.8  billion dollars  over the next few years to look after their interests, where is his first loyalty going to lie?  After the connection between the Bush family and the Saudis is made - along with a short segment about the business dealings that Bush had with the Taliban leaders - the film gets a bit bogged down in footage of the Iraq war.  Some of what we see is absolutely brutal (in this way, the film earned its "R" rating), bludgeneoning us with the cost of war.  Aside from showing us the cost of a war that is quickly losing support, Moore is saying,  this  is where this man Bush has taken us.  Do we really want to trust our military with someone like him?  As visceral as the experience of watching that footage is, the film loses its way here.  It becomes as though Moore is trying to throw all of his hatred for Bush into the mix.  The film could have been subtitled, WHY I HATE GEORGE W. BUSH AND YOU SHOULD TO.  Moore went after GM CEO Roger Smith in his first film,   urlLink Roger & Me  , and ever since he has had a Roger in each of his films.  In  Bowling for Columbine  it was Charlton Heston, and in  Fahrenheit 9/11  it is George W. Bush, and Moore goes after him with a vitriol that we have not yet seen from him.  Every frame of this film screams at us that Bush is absolutely the wrong man for the U.S., and that things can only begin to improve after he is deposed.  Moore makes an excellent case, and the film never ceases to be convincing.   Fahrenheit 9/11  is not without its flaws, but they are minor.  Moore's track record of bending facts and manipulating information leaves room for doubt.  The soldiers in Iraq say (and do) some pretty damning things, but we are not given much context for what they are saying, so we are left to trust that Moore is being straight with is.  So too with footage from "Baghdad, March, 2003," where we see people living what look to be normal, happy lives.  If not for Moore's history, this would be totally believable.  What really makes the film work is the fact that, unlike his previous films, Moore does not editorialize.  He lets the material speak for itself.  When you have the President of the United States sitting in a classroom in Florida, vacant look on his face, for almost ten minutes after his told of the second plane hitting the World Trade Center, there is really nothing that needs to be said.  Whatever your political bent, it cannot be denied that  Fahrenheit 9/11  is bravura filmmaking.  This film will drive you to tears, make you laugh, incite anger, frustration, and, if Moore has his way, inspire the viewer to drive Bush out of office.  In the current political climate, this film must be seen.  There is just too much vital information to be passed up.   urlLink Click here  for showtimes in your area.

       urlLink Gaspar Noé  appeared on the cinematic scene in 1991 with  Carne , a short film that plays like an appetizer for his first feature,  I Stand Alone .   Carne  introduces The Butcher, a man bitter with the world, one who hates many things, and covers his younger days, from 1965 to 1979, focusing on the late 70's.  The Butcher's anger comes to a head when his autistic daughter is assaulted.  The Butcher maims the wrong man and winds up in prison.  We follow his life through the years until he is released from prison.     Carne  is the perfect entry into Noé's work, giving us a hint of his view of the world without the brutality that would follow with his later work.  Noé wants to shock the audience, to damage them.  He brings a realness to the screen that other filmmakers seem frightened of.  His work is a antidote to the fuzzy, Hollywood reality of so many American films.  Noé has said that when "reality is portrayed it's so sentimental and cheaply humanist that you are disgusted, like a cake with too much sugar."  Noé takes out the sugar and sentimentality so that all we are left with is the bitter pill of life.   I Stand Alone    In Roger Avary's   urlLink Killing Zoe  , Eric ( urlLink Jean-Hugues Anglade ) talks at length about how disgusted he is by the image of Paris, the postcard, guide book Paris that attracts the tourists.  It is all shit to Eric, who prefers the uncharted parts of the city, the part that is literally underground.  When he brings Zed ( urlLink Eric Stoltz ) into the underground jazz club, he tells him that "this is the real Paris."  They are away from the landmarks, the tourists, the facade of the city.  The people are different underground, Eric tells Zed, because "they forget that they are in Paris.  They could be anywhere."  (Read more about Avary and his work  urlLink here .)  This desire to shed the image of Paris is at the heart of   urlLink I Stand Alone  , only here Noé explodes the idea so that it encompasses the whole of France.  France itself is actually the first image we see.  What follows, the prologue to the film, is an interesting talk about justice and morality.  Morality is for the poor.  Rules are made for the poor to follow while the rich do what they want.  Justice comes from the barrel of a gun.  That being so, right and wrong lose their relevance.  We make our own morality.  The film picks up where  Carne  left off.  The Butcher ( urlLink Philippe Nahon ) is released from prison.  Leaving Paris, he moves north, into a bourgoisie life with his new wife and her mother.  His wife, an unrepentant nag, is pregnant with The Buthcer's child and is at him constantly about finding a job.  The Butcher is a bitter, mysanthropic racist, and as the proud old Frenchman from a time that no longer exists, he  is  France.  The son of a French communist who was killed by the Nazis and orphaned on the streets of Paris, his life has been dominated by necessity.  "Getting ahead" is not something that occurs to The Butcher.  His concern is in not falling too far behind.   I Stand Alone  calls to mind   urlLink Taxi Driver   in its world view, The Butcher a logical extension of Travis Bickle.  Much of the dialogue comes through voice over, as the first part of the film is devoted to The Butcher vents his racial and nationalistic frustrations.  It is as if Noé is saying,  this  is France, behind the veneer of culture and old world European manners, everything France wants you to think it is, there lies a dark heart of racial fear, misogyny, bitterness.  The Butcher hates his wife with murderous passion.  He spends his days going to porno films, drinking in bars, avoiding going home.  His pregnant wife and her shrew of a mother have nothing but bile for him when he comes home at night.  His wife dangles her pregnancy over his head, so to the fact that she is supporting the both of them.  This brings to mind the problem of male sexuality, something else Noé has quite a bit to say about, as we will see in  Irreversible .  The Butcher has been emasculated by his circumstances.  With no job, no place to go, and no survival if not for the woman he is stuck with, The Butcher has nothing.  He is suicidal and begins to think about taking the wife and mother-in-law with him.  The point comes when The Butcher has had enough.  In one of the most shocking scenes in the film, The Butcher attacks his wife.  He punches her in her pregnant stomach over and over and over, killing the unborn child that would have sealed his fate.  With that, he is gone, back to the Paris streets.  In Paris, we see that this hateful streak is not exclusive to The Butcher.  As he drinks in a bar, he watches as the bartender refuses to serve an Arab man who walks in off the street.  After some dismissive remarks, the bartender bursts, "Take your Arab ass home, boy."  This is not one isolated person in some far flung town.  This is the norm, and this is Paris, the center of all things French.  After some failed attempts to find a job and move back into the fold, The Butcher goes out to find his daughter.  A mistake he made on her behalf is what sent him on this path to begin with, and reconnecting with her might bring some redemption to him.  Telling the nurse that he is going to take his daughter to see the Eiffel Tower - something we know can only be a lie - he takes her to his hotel room, the same one she was conceived in.  The film comes to a head here in a long scene where his thoughts spiral out of control.   I Stand Alone  leaves us with a stark view.  The Butcher is left with few options: he can have sex with his daughter, which would send him back to prison, or he can kill himself.  This is France.    Irreversible    To say that   urlLink Irreversible   caused a stir when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival would be an understatement.  The films's brutal rape scene was criticized as being exploitive, for going on too long.  With this film, Noé seems to be going out of his way to alienate the viewer.  The fact that the rape scene, along with other near-unbearable moments in the film,  does  go on too long, but that's the point.  Tying this film in with  I Stand Alone ,  Irreversible  opens with The Butcher and another man sitting in a dumpy apartment.  The Butcher reveals that he went to prison for having sex with his daughter.  As if to sum up his life and set up the film we are about to see, The Butcher tells us that, "Time destroys everything."   Irreversible  gives us an interesting portrait of male sexuality.  After we leave The Butcher, we find ourselves inside Rectum, the kind of hardcore, ultra-gay club that can only exist in cinema.  The fact that this is a gay club is beside the point.  The men here are violent in their pursuit of sexuality, practically raping each other.  There is little about this sex club that is actually sexual.  Rectum is dark, cavernous, depraved.  It is into this environment that Marcus ( urlLink Vincent Cassel ) comes to find his wife's rapist.  What happens when he finds him is little different than what we have seen in the club.  Le Tenia, the rapist, is beaten to death with a fire extinguisher by Pierre ( urlLink Albert Dupontel ), who at this point we think is just a friend of Marcus.  This scene is brutal, as Pierre beats Le Tenia over and over, caving his skull in.  Noé's camera never flinches from this, forcing us to watch this atrocity.  At this point in the film, we have no idea what brought this on.   Irreversible  moves in reverse, from the ending to the beginning.  This makes learning more about the characters all the more tragic, as we know where they will be by the end of the day.  In this structure, the first third of the film follows Marcus and Pierre as they barnstorm their way through the streets of Paris, looking for Le Tenia.  Marcus, the typical alpha male, will not be deterred in his quest.  Pierre is the more passive, sensitive one.  The object of their desire is Alex ( urlLink Monica Bellucci ), Marcus's girlfriend, Pierre's ex, who he is still in love with.  Pierre was with Alex, but he was unable to satisfy her sexually.  The implication is that he is impotent.  He is looking for answers that neither Alex nor Marcus can give him.  It is important, then, that at the end it is Pierre that savagely beats Le Tenia to death.  Pierre has finally achieved the orgasm he has been going so long without.  In this way, this scene is no different than the infamous rape scene.  The beating and the rape say the same thing about male sexuality: it is a brutal, demoralizing act.  Le Tenia brutalizes Alex.  The rape scene in  Irreversible  is one of the most viscerally affecting scenes in recent cinema.  It goes on and on and on, in one uninterrupted shot, for almost nine minutes.  At the end, Le Tenia beats her some more, and walks away coldly, as casually as though he had stopped to tie his shoes.  As we continue backwards through time, we see more of the relationship between Alex and Marcus, and we learn that Alex is pregnant, culminating in the final shot of the film.  Alex is in the park, just before she finds out that she will be having a child, and the camera starts to turn.  Alex's world is turned literally upside down.  The films of Gaspar Noé take more stomach to watch than the average release, but they tell us more about ourselves then most cinema today.

      We were watching    urlLink The Abyss   , when it got around to the scene where Bud (Ed Harris) is about to use the breathable water they had (I forget the exact name) and go out into the deep.  One of Bud's cohorts says to him, "We all breath water for nine months, Bud.  Your body just has to remember."  One of the people I was watching the film with said, "Actually, you don't."  She said, "That's one of the fallacies in this movie."  Now, one of my pet peeves is when people complain that movies are not real enough.    Movies aren't supposed to be real.    That's kind of the joy of watching them.  If you want real life, go stand on a street corner and watch the world go by.  Get on a city bus and listen to people talking about the horror of their lives.  Reality in all of its forms should be left on the sidewalk.  Film is an ideal, what we   wish   the world could be like.  If all films were exact duplications of real life, they would be so depressingly boring, so crushingly bleak, that they would lose their value as art.  Do we all breath water for nine months in the womb?  It is irrelevant, and in terms of   The Abyss   it shouldn't really matter.  What is important is that   in the reality of this movie,   the characters believe that.  It is interesting that the same people who have a problem with lines like that, seem to have no issue at all with underwater extraterrestrials, or any of the other aspects of the film that require us to suspend disbelief.  Should we criticize films?  Absolutely.  Criticism itself is an art form, and it is unfortunate that the state of criticism has declined recently.  The average critical article now consists of a few paragraphs of summary, capped off with a paragraph or two of "I did/did not like this movie."  What we have are not critics as much as pompous "journalists" who know little or nothing about the filmmaking process.  You can find their droppings in the pages of your local paper, and it won't take much before you realize why criticism is no longer taken seriously in this country.  To paraphrase Truman Capote, these people are not writing about film, they are typing.  Film is an art, the same as painting, sculpture or any of the other more recognized art forms, and it should be treated as such when we are writing about it.  There is no such thing as a "good film" or a "bad film," but rather a films that work and films that do not, films that are artistically successful and films that are not.   urlLink Most of these "critics"  would be more suited to typing up the weekly obituary than to talking about film, their published pages finding their use in the birdcages of the world.

      Or, Why I Do This...  I love film.  It's that simple.  As far back as I can remember, it was the only thing I ever really cared about, the only thing that ever really moved me.  As I grew and discovered other interests (literature, politics, etc.), I always came back to film, my experience enriched by what I picked up elsewhere.  I am told that the first movie I ever saw was   The China Syndrome  .  My parents took me to see it in 1979, when I was three weeks old.  They wanted to see it and for some reason they let me tag along.  I saw a lot of films that way in my early years:   Batman  , with Adam West and Burt Ward,   Beverly Hills Cop, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,   all the staples of early '80's art house cinema.  I don't know exactly how often the three of us went to the movies, but it was a lot, and I cannot even say that I   remember   all of these experiences, though I know they happened, but they made an impression because the seeds of my cinematic obsession were sewn.  One day the Old Man announced that we were going to buy a VCR.  I could hardly believe it.  I had known about VCR's.  One of my mother's friends had one, and one day after a school-sponsored field day event, we went over to her house, and I watched   First Blood   on the VCR while my mother and her friend sat in the other room and talked the afternoon away.  So the machines were not new to me, but the idea of actually having one was difficult to wrap my mind around.  We were typically the last ones on the block to get the newest toys, if we ever got them, not because we were poor (not even close), that was just the way it was.  We did not even have a microwave in the house until I was almost out of high school, and to this day my mother still does not own one.  So we headed down to Video Vendors in Napa, CA, and bought our first VCR.  After that, renting videos became a common thing in addition to our trips to the theater.  My obsession grew, and over the years I followed the dots from one thing to another.  If I liked a particular actor, I would seek out all of the movies he had appeared in.  I noticed the same director's names popping up, the same writers, and I sought out their work.  Point to point to point I went, until I was talking about films that the people around me had not even heard of.  My enthusiasm grew by bounds.  I had this thirst to see whatever I could, any way I could.  I was watching movies from Hong Kong on bootleg video tapes long before they popped up over here.  At some convention or another I found some tapes of films by a guy named John Woo, and I quickly fell in love with his work.  When I read that he was coming to the U.S. to make films, my excitement at the prospect was matched only by the disappointment in his work that followed.  I do this to share my enthusiasm.  The disappointments, the discoveries, all of it.   urlLink My last attempt at blogging  was a bit of a wash, but I'm in a different head space now.  I want this to grow, find its own form as I find my own style.  I hope you'll stick with me...
