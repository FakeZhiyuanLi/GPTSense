      Having just returned to the United States after 4 years in Canada, I find myself halfway between returning "home" and embarking upon something new and strange. I can't say that I feel entirely at ease. Oh, certain aspects of my environment take on a rather deja vu quality, but I find that this experience is more like a waking dream. There is a similarity, a kind of partial memory, but it is more subconscious than specific. If I wander about, I eventually find my way.   I returned to Vancouver, BC for the last few weeks, working on a conference and seeing a few friends. Returning is ever bittersweet. Disappointment seems unavoidable as expectations meet reality. I doubt one can ever truly go back. It seems as though, in the act of moving away, one has committed an unforgiveable act, severing connections and putting up walls. The traveller is both precious and impermanent, for they have proved they are not to be depended upon to stay in place, and may be gone any minute from sight and memory. This leads to conditions of either nonchalance or clinginess, as one either wants to keep from depending upon this tenuous relationship, or wants to savor every moment, denying that this person is indeed, for all intents and purposes, gone from the scene, except for the briefest reappearance.  I found myself labelled a "tourist" in the place I called home the last 4 years. Is it possible to be a tourist once one has moved away from a place one has lived a significant period of time? Or can one only be a tourist only in a place one has never called home? Certainly, on returning, the activities one tends to be drawn to are a distillation of what one used to do, and in their simplicity, echo the actions of a tourist. A kind of nostalgia is added to the mix, that tends to cause discomfort when faced with unavoidable change and simple day-to-day ordinaryness.  Today, I was finally able to insure my car again, after being unable to drive it the last two years. The subject of the car as a symbol of personal freedom is a familiar one, nevertheless, it is still surprising how intense this feeling is in practice. Knowing that every avenue is open to you, that there is no restriction on your movement, that you have the power to go anywhere you wish, this has far reaching implications. The car is not only the vehicle for moving from point A to point B. While in this vehicle, not only do you seem to own the space it occupies, but the vast space in every direction. You are in control of where you might go. As long as there is fuel, there are seemingly no limits. Unlike the lack of control we so often face in relationships and daily work, the roads seem to promise unending options, unfettered access, the power to choose any path and end up anywhere you wish to go.  This seeming freedom of action and movement is especially seductive now, returning to uncertainty and the claustraphobia of "home." No job prospects in sight, no promised solution, but returning to a place one thought and hoped was past. Returning to square one, and giving up one's autonomy and free will. Certainly, the first time one leaves home, it is both a thrilling and frightening experience. But what if one returns after experiencing years of independent action, self-dependent and self-driven? How can one give this up in one motion, regressing to the life of a child?  Although the traveller, the one who has left and made a new life, has taken on new challenges and modes of being, the stationary one, the parent who has remained the same, is only comfortable falling back into old patterns of the past, relentlessly struggling to recover their mastery of this wayward youth, this former traveller who has seemingly re-entered their scope of control. Hence, the draw of the open road ahead, the perception of personal freedom in the midst of the inevitable loss of self.
