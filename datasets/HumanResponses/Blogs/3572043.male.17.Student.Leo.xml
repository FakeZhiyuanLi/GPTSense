      Had been a very long hour an hour ago. Bah, visited the dentist after being being told of a few bad things that an extra tooth behind your original set of tooths might do to you. A little motivation from my eldest bro and I gave up fending for my tooth. Twasn't bad actually, it's just that I hate the first 2 injections. And again, 2? I took 3. The first 2 didnt kill the pain throughoutly. Yes, it feels like ant bite, like my mum said.   Yes, most Malaysians are chickens when they come face to face with a dentist, bothj skilled and unskilled. It's true, I struggled like a chicken waiting to be slaughtered by a butcher. Bad enough, me and my bro had the SAME, I repeat, SAME problem. Except that he had his pest on the right side, and mine on the left. I was called in first. The dentist looked normal enough. He checked my tooth and said the same thing as my mum did. "The tooth wont do any good if it stays." Oh boy, did my mouth felt violated or what. Then, he took an x-ray of my tooth to check on it's root. If it's straight, it would be easy and if it's crooked, it's doomsday. Mine was straight by the way and was praying for it to be crooked so that I wont have to remove it. Dont really know about my bro's.  The first injection was the sUx. I felt itchy all over my gum and wanted to scratch. Then, the second injection wasnt so bad. After that, the dentist tried to remove the tooth. He stick something into the side of my tooth and attempted to remove it, hence the pain rushing into the pin-point part. I cried "Ith hurths, it hurths..." and the dentist said "Um, you need another injection." Thats how I ended up with 3 tiny holes in my gum. The tooth came out and I never knew. LOL, was I freaked out to find a bloody tooth beside me. Well, it was worth it and... Yes, my gum's still numb from the injections. Wonder will I suffer from "Tranquilizea Overdosee"(dont mind this one, it means nothing). Anyway, peace and Zengar outh.

      I led Knight(an admin of GUM) down... I promised him to do missions with him in FFXI yesterday night, but the leveling was too great(200exp per kill!) and I forgot all about him... Now he is angry with me. Bad... Need to leave him be for the time being...

      Last night, I tossed and turned for a few hours before finally fallen asleep... Argg, teh sleepiness! Well, school? Yes, late! A prefect discovered my fingernails and forced me to cut them...   After disposing my nails, my form teacher took the opportunity to abuse me for being late... Saying "Who are you? Are you from this class?" and "Please introduce yourself!"... Okie, the first subject - Malay Language... The previous teacher migrated to West Malaysia, bah, will miss his jokes. The new teacher, a serious one... Bad. He spent 2 periods explaining boring stuff to us. It was a miracle for me to listen the whole morning without sleeping.   The next period - Geography. I passed Geography but was a mark less from my target. The teacher, still as hot and aggresive as ever... Hot as in sexy and aggresive as in "rowr..."... Hehehe...  Modern Maths... Mr. good guy wont let me retake. I was 2 hours late for the test but I managed to get 16%. Screw him.  Whoooooo! Got 64% for Basics of Accounting and I finally passed Commerce! 64% for PA and 46% for Commerce... W00t.  The rest? Failed Moral. Yay, I am a moraless human! I am proud to be one. Yay.  Going home on a bike with a friend. At least I didnt have to walk past the dogs' alley. Bah, I hate dogs.

      Life sucks. I am taking national exam on October, I have a project waiting for me to redo(yea, I messed up the last one), I have FFXI calling for me and I have not finished Super Robot Wars MX(Chapter 40 at the moment).   I traded my Radeon 9200 for my friend's Radeon 9800pro and it seems not working on my system(yes, I owe him some money too). Told him about it and he is willing to trade back our graphic cards. Thinking of saving money for Radeon 9600.  Okie, life is sux0r! Nubli and Fubuki(a friend) are using 'ung' instead of 'uck'! That means... "Fung you!" instead of what we know... Man, they sung...

      Had been a long time since I last posted. Heh, yeah, life sucks. Well, nothing much had happened until now. Just that Frostheart, aka Seth from  urlLink http://tekhnikolorprojektor.blogspot.com/ &nbsp;, Light and some real life friend of mine offered a comeback to RO. english RO that is. A malaysian server. Seth said he will spare me 3 millions of zenny(RO's currency) for me to start off. I have decided to play a Swordman(infact, the first class since I started ROing) and get him to job level 50. Turn him into a Crusader&nbsp;to my upmost delight. I plan to start my Swordman with my custom build of VIT > AGI = INT, Devoted Crosser.  Anyway, Seth turned to 29 a few days ago. Congratulations, dude. Happy go older. May your wish of having a busty girl by your side be fullfilled. Then, life sucks hahaha. Did you break those red ceremonial hard boiled eggs? Or did you dropped a piece of cake onto your executive? Or even set a horn in a pair of booties? Hahaha, was joking. Life is not as kinky as you(and I) imagine. We are just being dynamic. Duh, about little girl prosties and your fat boobies... Heck, peace guys. Zengar out.
