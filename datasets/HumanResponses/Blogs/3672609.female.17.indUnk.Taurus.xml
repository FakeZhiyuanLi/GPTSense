      I've always wondered what it would be like to be dead... just for a day.  Just to see what it would be like.  What heaven is like and what happens.  To see who would cry for me.  Who would come to my funeral... and how many people would come cause they actually cared, and who would come just to be nice, or because they felt they had to.  I wonder, who would be sorry, who would be happy, who would be miserable, who would be hopeful, or scared, or mad... And then I woder if that day was today, or tomorrow... what would people say? how would they react? how would I react if someone close to me died today, or tomorrow? All the unfinished plans, and crushed dreams.... I wonder what death is like.  I hate it when people are demeaning.  I mean, everyone is at some point, i guess, but I hate it when someone is like that all the time, even if it's not conscious... but I think it is.  Like, when you say something, and then they say something back to you like they're better than you, or their opinion's better... it frustrates me.  I wonder sometimes how many people really really care.  I wonder if when they say "you can talk to me", if they mean it.  There are people who want nothing more than to talk to you about your problems, but you don't want to tell.  And the people you do want to talk to, rarely even listen, or ask.  It must be about finding the person who wants to listen and you feel comfortable with...  this life business is far too confusing.

      I am proud to announce that Ash and I are going vegetarian for a month... we'll see how it goes... big change, but still fun I think.   Auditions were today.  Mine went well I think... there were alot of really good people there though, so we'll see what happens I guess. So, if so many people think they have talent, but they really don't, how would you ever know if you were talented?  I guess just by what other people tell you... hm.  I was glad that so many people came out for musical.  it should (hopefully!) be really good. I mean, it better be if I'm missing Grease to be in it. I hate this coldness. I always think it's really dumb when people talk about the weather (cause i mean, really, it's a lame subject) but this weather is really something to talk about. Ok, the coldest place n the world? right here, right now.  That's creepy!  it hasn't been this cold here since 1966. that's 38 years! WOAH!  Ah well. Ihave 5 hours of choir on Sunday... I just pray that Ms. Voigts is in a pleasant mood for that concert/cantare hour. (Kayleigh, please!!) lol Well, tht's about it.  Going to do my math homework (gasp! ahead of time!!) Tip of the day:  Don't run on ice.

      Yesterday Saskatchewan was the coldest place on the Earth. No jokes, it's a complete fact. With the windchill, we got up to -65 degrees or so. The arctic was only -29. I think we must all be crazy, but at least we're Canadian.

      This is dedicated to dear Rachelle. Rachelle is a very petite french woman who plays the piano. She's the pianist at the studio (she's amazing. she can play anything!) Anyways, she plays for all the ballet classes basically everyday. We're not quite sure why but instead of driving Rachelle rides a bike everywhere she goes (And I have to give her my full appreciation for her ambition). She even rode her bike this week in -40 degree weather. We all think she's crazy but she's so sweet we can't understand. Rachelle, here's to you.

      (good song) First day of semester 2. I think we might have one of the smallest classes in the school! There's 12 people in our Histoire class. I like it though cause I know everyone and it's like our own little immersion posse. I've come to realize how much of a little clic we are. (I don't like the word "clic" but still) That's what we've become. We all have other friends and other things to do but it all comes down to the francais in all of us. Oh merde. *Sunrise, sunset,...(thump)* 3rd period: Bio 30. My cousin is in my class and I find that quite amusing! There's bearly any grade elevens. Oh well, makes me laugh the Mike is in my class.  Lunch at Mickey D's. (Again, they should have breakfast ALL day. Don't you agree?) We saw Dusty there with his friends. Good times. I got a free meal (yah!) "I'm lovin' it!" We were late for fourth today but I don't think it was a big deal. Mr. Earl seems pretty cool. He's so lazy it's funny! I think he'll be a good teacher. He reminds of someone....I don't know why. Hmm...??? I've decided that I'm going vegetarian for a week. Just something interesting to try. I'm always up for something new. I'm starting tomorrow. Well, more or less today.

      -Ella (sooo cool) I wish i could hear her sing. That would be amazing.  I remember one time in like, grade 9, Ashleigh gave me a note that she had written in class and it was all songs.  It was so crazy.  Remember? I don't know why I just thought of that... minds are funny like that sometimes.   Goodtimes last nite.  Kareoke was fun. I love those girls.  Tres crazy. *Nananananananana, nanananananana, gettin jiggy wit it!... Uh. Yo*  Egg McMuffins are so good.  Why?  I mean, you'd think that getting an egg, some cheese and a piece of ham on an english muffin from soem cheap fast food place would be nasty.  Well, they're not nasty.  Ash and I were discussing how McDonalds breakfast should be all day. wouldn't that be sweet?  I think so.  *We heard your repetoire, and at the final bar, we greeted you, we greeted you with round applause*  I'm learning percussion for a song we're doing in choir called Uberlebensgross (long name, i know).  It's sweet! I get to play bamboo poles, a woodblock and congos!   Ms Voigts even made up some words to go along with my rythms so I can learn them.  There are 4 of us doing percussion and it's gonna be awesome.  Everyone should come to the SCC spring concert (April 23) JUST to hear this song.  It's so amazing!!! I really recommend everyone see at least one SCC concert in their life.  Once you've been to one, you'll be hooked for life.  I mean, I went to a concert 5 years ago, and look at me now! AHHHHH!  One more night with braces!!  By tomorrow morning at school I will be braces-free.  Sweet.  Tip of the Day:  "Nodding your head and smiling will get you through 90% of adult interactions" -Boy on a Stick and Slither ...it really does work, try it sometime.

      *aphid: Any of various small, soft-bodied insects of the family Aphididae that have mouthparts specially adapted for piercing and feed by sucking sap from plants. Also called plant louse.  Ah, the weekend. So wonderful, so joyful and pleasant. Haha! Yes, no homework, no school tomorrow, nothing to worry about (except for dance but that's anothe story).  *Sophie, did you get my letter? I'm kind of excited for 2nd semester to start. Fresh beginning kinda thing, you know? I know it's still school (i will end up with homework all week, i'll be tired from having to wake up early and i'll have to see Mr. K's not so pleasant figure in the morning. let's just hope that we don't have a concert soon because i don't think i can handle the pit stains.) but it'll be new, in a way, and changed from the routine we've all grown into. Haylie now has yet another male body part: Reginald. he's not as bad as Joe but still, it's tuff. I wonder why they're male? Hmm... Saw Ashley at the mall today working at The Body Shop (go to the body shop! they have awesome stuff) Anyways, she turned nineteen on Friday. (Happy belated birthday Ash!) Tip of the hour: Dress warm and drive safe. It's cold and icy!

      *God is a DJ Life is a dance floor Love is the rythm You are the music* I like this song, it's good.  Remind me to buy the cd.  Went bowling tonight with work.  It was a good time.  I got progressively worse as the night went on.  it sucked. :P  So anyway, they gave out prizes for like, the highest and lowest scoring teams, best and worst players.  And they started reading out the winners before my team was finished playing!  We were like, that's so rude... stupid thinking they're better than us. grrr.  My bowling shoe size is 6.  That's a full size smaller than my regular shoe size... interesting.  They should just make the sizes right, rather than smaller, wouldn't that make more sense?  Tomorrow nite kareoke party! (it's been in the last 2 blogs as well... this is jsut a reminder in case you missed the other mentions)  Sweet!  it'll be great fun.  No school on Monday! yesss!  *Baby boy you stay on my mind, fulfill my fantasies... I think about you all the time, i see you in my dreams* Ash-- That'd be a good cd for the hip hop classes, no?  Going for coffee with Kenji and Kayleigh before choir tomorrow... kenj doesn't know it yet, but we are!!  Should be good times.  I love those girls... hope the exam went well.    *3 days till my braces come off!!!!!!* this is so exciting.  I've decided I won't wish this weekend away though, it's gotta be lots of fun cause I have NOTHING to do! hehe  Today was a good hair day. I wish I had time every day to do my hair all pretty.  Why is it that I never have any time??  argh. I wish there were more than 24 hours in a day.  That'd be sooo sweet. Who decided that's the way it works anyway? I think it's dumb.  Tip of the day:  When life gives you avacados, make some guacamole.  I mean, you might as well, it's much tastier, and it's better than just sitting around with a bunch of avacados, doing nothing.

      Went to see School of Rock yesterday. Makes you wanna be 10 years old again! Thoses kids are so cool. Go see or rent it when it comes out. Very funny! I went out with Courtney yesterday and showed my excellent driving skills. (I not a very good driver.) Ice is no good. Anyways, there was this white Jetta in front of us and it was switching lanes every second and cutting us off and what not. Courtney says "Stay behind this guy, he's probably messed." (Because we don't know anyone who has a white Jetta.) It ended up being Jesse (crazy driver!). We both screamed and had a good laugh. Oh Jesse, what are we going to do with you? *And I will waste no time worried 'bout the rainy weather* John Mayer heals all. It was officially "Clean-out-room-and-make-Ashleigh-sad-day". Well, I wasn't really all that sad. You see, if you've seen my room you know that it's always a mess. I warn people but I think they've just learned to expect it. It's never clean and there's always SO much stuff packed into one area. Well, my mom went in there today and threw away half my stuff (clothes, toys, ect.) and now my room lots empty. (Well, to me anyways. To anyone else it looks like a normal room.)  Kareoke night at my house on Sunday.  Tip of the day: Change the oil in your car when the sticker says to. (Usually you get a sticker or receit from the shop to tell you when you should change your oil according to your milage.) Do it. The sticker never lies.

      -Cool keyboard kid from School Of Rock! Funny funny show.   Anywho, the math final is OVER!!!  3 cheers! :)  i spent all day yesterday and all of this morning studying with the girls...  Jo does math voodoo.  People, guard your calculators!  Yes, you too.  You never know when the voodo will strike.   *I'm addicted to you, but you know that you're toxic*  I would like to take this opportunity to wish Kayleigh good luck on her voice exam. *GOOD LUCK KAYLEIGH!* you'll do great, i know.  There's nothing you can't do!  I would also like to adress the issue of hhh.  Quite appealing despite the "impurities"...Any thoughts?  Kareoke with the girls: Sunday nite @ Ashleigh's house.  Be there or be S-Q-U-A-R-E   Saw Ramanjooloo @ earls tonite again. (3rd time!) Very interesting, spoke to him about (what else?) math.  He was tres surprised to hear that our final was worth 40%.  Yes, even Ramanjooloo was surprised.  Well, that's about it.  Congrats to the Contacts on yet another win on Thursday! :)  Word of the day: gondola- "A long, narrow boat propelled with a single oar and used on the canals of Venice" (aka what i'll be riding in a few years when i'm famous and living at my venice vacation house)

      You know, the dictionary actually is quite interesting to read.  You find out alot of stuff that you didn't know before.  like, for example, you might be sitting one day wondering, there's a definition for everything, but what's the definition for "definition"??  Well, it's simple, you just find it in the dictionary, and Voila!.... "to state the specific meaning". So there.  ya learn something knew everyday.  Anywho, So today I was sitting at my computer and Ashleigh came online, so I was like, sweet!  and i said hi to her.  Then, all of the sudden her name changes to "jo is soooo cool!" and her picture changes to a thing that says "Jo Rocks"  well, I as like, ok, whatever, she's just a little bit hyper and she must be talking to jo on the phone.  So then she starts saying all these wierd things like: "you dumb hobo..." and "indeed" and i was like, ok this is not something ashleigh would say, but whatever, she's turned wierd over nite.  Anyway, as you've probably already guessed, it was jocelyn... argh.  and i was obviously not all there becasue the hints were pretty huge.  So anyway, the moral of this story is to not be l'idiote like moi. :P  Hooray for us on our drama final! :):)  Big, muchos relieved... only math on friday and hopefully I will get through that one alright... It's graded on a curve, so that coul be either really good or really bad... depending on what everyone else gets.  hm... we'll see i guess.  going to study hard tomorrow at the house of Mlle impressoniste-extraordinaire (Jocelyn).  Well, must get rested up for my big study day tomorrow! :) just lovely.  Word of the day: palanquin- "a covered litter for 1 person that is carried on poles on the shoulders of men" (aka: my new method of travel... i just need to find some manservants.)

      i love my cheesecake and my cheesecake loves me. we're as happy as we can be be! (good times at earls. for good food, eat there. ask for Steve.)  ok, so drama went better that i expected. we pulled together our play yesterday and still came out with an 85%. yes!!! the beginning was great (everyone was laughing which is great because it IS a comedy) but the ending needed work. work that we did not do. oh well! 85% is still pretty good. Jamie rules!!!  *I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war, if you tell me something worth fighting for.*   after the play me and courtney were starving (not really, but you know, we can always eat.) so we headed to earls. i've always had a thing about lobsters and i don't really like eating lobster because of the shell. i don't know why, but the shell always turns me off. anyways, so we order this platter with shrimp, dynamite rolls, salmon and cucumber salad. (it was really good by the way!) so it comes and the shrimp are the kind you peel and eat (you know, with the shell still on.) so i grab a shrimp, start to peel and i can't. there's really something wrong with me but i can't peel shrimp. not that i physically can't, but it just makes me so scared. i don't know why! i now know that i have a phobia of shell fish. not the actual part you eat but the shell. oh my! i just couldn't do it. i have a problem.  *Dizzy from the shopping mall. I searched for joy, but I bought it all.*  tomorrow=no final! yah! i have to study for one though. i'll be so happy when friday comes and goes. well, not ALL of friday but the part where i have to write my math final. afterwards it's celebration time! french went very well today though. i really think i did excellent! :)

      ...somebody put their hands in the air and waved them like they just didn't care. --I love those commercials  Ok, so I was thinking about titles.  Who decided that only the words 4 letters or longer in a title get capitalized?  Are the other words not important enough?  What makes a word important?  It's length?  Maybe this is where everyone gets the idea that size matters... because in titles, it does!  In honour of all the short/"unimportant" words that were never capitalized, I capitalized ONLY the short words in my title.   *It's always times like these when I think of you and I wonder if you ever think of me...*  What goes through boy minds?  I wish I knew.  Sometimes they can be so confusing.  If you are a boy and you are reading this, feel free to comment and help me out a little. I think we've almost got it figured out.  *I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts...*  Actually, I don't, but I like the song.  I love the lion king.  Rafikki's awesome.  The musical was AMAZING and now everytime I watch that movie I get all shivery when the sun comes up.  sigh.  If you haven't seen it on stage, you should.  I would pay double to see it again, that's how amazing it was.  In honour of today, put your hands in the air and wave them around like you just don't care. And for this, we salute you.

      -Justin Timberlake  Justin...:)  Ok, Kayleigh is one of the funniest people ever! I've heard so many stories about her. She got stuck in her car the other day and her elbow was blasting on the horn because her foot was stuck on the shifter and she was trying to climb out over top of her pile of stuff because her care wouldn't lock form the outside. It's funnier when Courtney tells it, but then again, this is a written, brief description.  Haylie was telling me about the 5 stages of being scared (he version of it anyways and we've decided that it can also work for laughing.) 1. Shaking in your shoes. (Kinda of scared but nothing is really moving.) 2. Shaking in your socks. (Enough that a tremble breaks out.) 3. Shaking in your skin. (You're obviously scared and run for cover.) 4. Pee your pants. (So scared, a little pee comes out.) 5. Number two in your pants. (Very rare, but this is obviously scared shitless!)  Suzy likes Ken. But you see, Ken likes Barbie. But Barbie really wants someone like Sam. But all Sam wants is Suzy. Haha!

      French tomorrow.... ahhh!  I'm n-o-t ready for this one... :S oh yeah, and star-child is tomorrow night... n-o-t ready for that one either!  I'll be soooo glad when tomorrow is over. then i have wednesday AND thursday to study for math!  hoorah!  I will be soooo glad. When I was coming home from work today I saw a big like, greyhound type bus.  I miss choir tour.  Only like, 6 more months, then i'll be there! yay!! Do people really mean it when they say "Any time you need to talk, I'm here for you..." or are they just saying it to be nice?  Because some people say it, and you think they really mean it, but they never make an effort to ask you about what's bothering you after that.  And then there are the people who ask too much.  It's like the only thing they want to talk about and they're way too pushy.  People are strange realy. I must try to figure them out.  Graham is going to Kelowna to "visit Kyle (Riabko) and John (Mayer!!!!)".  That's amazing. I swear, little toon town produces wayy more talent than it should, considering it's size. Kyle is obviously amazing cause he's signed with Columbia, and Graham is obviously going to be famous sometime soon.  All these guitar-playing boys who write songs... just crazy. i have voice and dance tonight... not a good night to be super busy.  ah well, would life be interesting if i just sat around all day? nope! :) Moving up in the world!  I am now gonna start answering support issues at work.  hoorah! no more weather mapping for me! :)

      Courtney has no life. Ha! (You know I love ya!)  Anyways, I'm really hungry right now. Just got home from dance and such. I don't really have to do anything tonight because I DON'T HAVE A FINAL TOMORROW! Yay! (Sorry to all that do.) I'm feeling quite tired from last night. (Hockey team was over. Always a good time.)   I was thinking about impressions today. Not like stamps (but stamps are tres cool. I think I shall get some stamps.) but like, first impressions. People can fool you, oh yes they can! You know when you think someone looks like they're really great but then you watch them for awhile afterwards and they do something stupid? Or, when someone's first impression isn't that good but they amaze you in the end because their really great. Or you get a really great first impression from someone and then you don't see them again and for all you know they could have been putting on a show. Or sometimes it's not even people it's like, a situation, well, a situation between people. Anyways, and you're under the impression that something is happening but (not wit you, but with other people) and it really isn't and then you find out that it really wasn't then next day. I bet only a few people know what I'm talking about.  Mmm...supper was good tonight. Drama rehersal tomorrow. I have to go to the school even though, I have no school. Oh dear!

      Why does Justin Timberlake remind me of Michael Jackson? How is he so cool? How do people always come up with different rhymes and unique words? Why is there only 26 letters in the alphabet? If there were more, what would the world be like? Would everything change? Why isn't there just one universal language? Do you think it would bring world Peace? Or war? Why do people love to hate? Is it that everyone is jealous of everyone else? Has greed taken over the world? What if there was no money, would people share? Would we play together and not care about one another's material things? Why is everyone addicted to television? How is it that you can be so wrapped up in another person's life? Why is imagination so much better then relaity? What if those two words came together, would the world be all that we want it to be? If there wasn't hunger, would there still be satisfaction? If there were no rules, would there still be rebels? What if everyone went against one another? Would we get what we want? What if the world worked together? Would we be one?

      Okay, my inner child is 1. (Take quiz at www.quizzilla.com) Anyways, this is what it said I' like: "Everything is new to me. I like watching the world go by around me, and I don't sweat the small stuff--or the large stuff, either. Just so long as I stay warm and safe and dry, life's pretty good." I was delighted. Everything is wonderful and happy!  The Contacts kick some but yesterday at the Schroh. Contacts 5, Blazers 3. I am now 4 dollars richer on account that Tyler is not good at picking the winning team. Good job boys! (*Game on Saturday @ 8*)  Movie tonight with the girls. We're going to see "Along Came Polly"! Should be some good times. Always is with us! Hehe..."Sparzan, watch-out!" Tommy Lee Jones is such a hottie.

      Ok, so some people are under the impression that we are actualy like, normal.  This is a problem.  For all of you who know us... well, you know us. For those of you who don't... eofofofoeoeoeofofof.  For example... we've alredy burst into hysterical laughter twice during the writing of this blog... make that thrice... "There's something wrong with you... really"   "I've got a lovely bunch of cocoNUTS... there they are all standing in a row bom bom bom..."   Wayne's World is possibly one of the funniest movies in the world.  I mean, really "party time! excellent!"  That and Zoolander... "*gasp*!  You can read minds?"  baha.  Good times in the hood. "Dans le ghetto, dans le ghetto"  * Chopsticks might be the death of me. Oh my! Well, ok now I seriously can't think because of that song going over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over, ect. in my head! STOP! STOP NOW!  I sometimes wonder, when people write their away messages on ICQ, if they're actually telling the truth or just something they made up or a favorite song. Espescially when it rhymes or sounds like rap. But it could be true. The funny thing is nobody knows what I'm talking about and I'm simply rambling on and on about nothing. But it is an issue. Sort of. Live in the now, people. Just live in the now!

      Black Eyed Peas are so great.  Things that seem somewhat wrong: 1. There is only 24 hours in a day. 2. Laura is Matt's sister. 3. "I have a male bodypart named Joe." 4. Driving in neutral to save gas. 5. My oil. 6. Peanut butter for lunch. 7. My inability to add comments to this blog. 8. Mr. Roy wearing Pink 9. Our drama production is being called a comedy. 10. I still haven't showered and Courtney will be here in 10 minutes.

      down by the dock and countin' the stars as the cool wind blows.  Last night was a good time: hockey and a party. Well, the boys won in overtime (stress levels goes up big time!) but at least they won. The playoffs will have my house even more crazy then it already is. My sister has a new obsession with my perfume. I have a headache. Adria's house was good time. I got to meet Kendra, like actually meet her and talk to her and such, even though I know too much about her. Grease is the word! Hahaha! Some other news came our way too (besides that Pierre is a drunk. He's hilarious though!) about Mr. Duck. No worries though. I know it's frustrating and it has to be. Don't make it something it's not just let it flow. Whatever comes of it is fine. I also saw that I was completely crushing on someone new. I don't have a name for him yet, but he's worthy. I don't know why. I mean, he is smart, funny, cute, he doesn't do any bad stuff,....but yet, i don't think I'd want something with him. Or would I? Alright enough of that...DJ might have been looking at me last night. (I'm such a sucker I know) but I think I might go with Kenji plan (even though it's really corny) unless of course some intervention comes into play. Then we'll see....ah. My mock exam is today then I'm off to my dad's house to eat and be merry! Hahaha!

      I bought the Mandy Moore cd today.  It's really good. all oldies-new versions.  awesome.   I'm a bit confused as far as les garcons go.  Why oh why is the one i want impossible to have?  And why can I not just accept it?  I find myself liking him, but then forcing myself not to, which is what I should do all the time.  But then, I let my guard down, and that's when it hits me the hardest.  grrrrr.  I was thinking about beliefs and people "changing" they're beliefs.  Like, you hear about it all the time with marriages, people changing their religions to marry someone (ie. My Big Fat Greek Wedding).  How can you stop/make yourself believe in something?  Like, the guy in Greek Wedding, was he just baptized Greek so he could marry her, or did he truly and honestly deep down believe in what he was doing?  I mean, I can understand if you switch churches (ie. catholic to lutheran, or something else close) because you get married, but to purposely get  baptized  into a different belief? I don't know where you draw the line though.  Which comes first: love for God, or love for another person? I could never ever even switch denominations for love of another person... not that i would never change my beliefs, but it would have to be on my own time.... hm.  there's my spiel.  Hats off  (i'm sooo funny!) to Riley for his hat trick tonight at the hockey game,  looks like it was an intense one (4-4).  Funniest thing: whoever that was getting pushed over after the goal.  I laughed.  Well, back to the books.  School is really such a chore.

      I have adopeted a Sea Monkey.  I've done this because.... I don't know exactly, but I've always wanted one.  I've also decided to name it Dona Josefa because it's a name that is very near and dear to our hearts, plus... it's fun to say.   Well, that's all for now! Have a pleasant evening.

      Have you ever felt alone?  Like, really completely alone?  Like, you need to lift the pain, and the people you think will listen are not interested and don't listen, and the people who will are not available, so there's nothing for you to do to deal with the pain inside but to sit and cry into empty space? I feel like that.

      ...When you're fast asleep.  I don't wanna!!!!!! This week has been a gooder, I don't wanna go back to school. The homework, the stress, the early mornings, the stupid lunch hours, the endless ramblings of Mr. Roy on how the world is coming to a stop and yet another bathroom party with Sadia on the topic of Mr. Earl and the O.C.  I kinda wish I were going to France. I mean, I think it'd be so fun! But then again, I really don't have time for an exchange partener. Clemintine and Marine are very fun girls. I spent the day with the gang out to Midtown and a movie (do not rent My Boss' Daughter. Bad choice all around.)

      ...ya really know how to dance.  Well anyway, I went to Breanna's house tonite and we made chocolate-layer-cake-deLUXE.  It was sooo good, and it was quite the adventure to make it too... really. First we found the cake mix, so we were like, hm, let's make cake.  Then we decided we needed frosting, so we went to Safeway and bought some.  Then we decided we wanted to rent Freaky Friday cause it's a pretty sweet movie and we like the boy in it.  So we went back to Breanna's house to get money for a movie, and her mom told us we had no eggs!   Well   you can't make a cake without eggs, so we had to get eggs to.  So the second trip consisted of us going to Rodger's, in the wrong direction (what can i say? i was driving.) and then getting the movie, getting eggs, and going back.  Anyway, it was totally worth it cause the cake was delicious (and i'm feeling kinda sick right now) and the movie was excellente.  Contacts vs. Blazers game last nite.  Quite the exciting match.  Contacts won, very good thing, and there were two b i g fights.  Oh boys, when will you learn?  Well, it was quite the game anyway. Now is the time for drastic measures.  I'm thinking hard of how to get around obviousness.  What will we do with this boy? On the other hand, these are tough times.  Everyone seems to be falling apart a little.  Maybe 16 must be the year of this kind of stuff.   Sometimes i just wish it would be next year so that I could skip all the shitty stuff and move to when we're all happy again.  life never stops being surprising.  Everything you think will happen  never  does.  And the things that are so far off, they never even cross your mind, can happen just like that.  That can be so sucky. *Heaven bent to take my hand, and lead me through the fire.* Don't worry girls, this too shall pass.

      I'm great. My knee is better, I have a week off of school, the frenchies are here, so what do I have to complain about? Nothing.  So I'm not calling this a complaint.  Why do we (girls) think boys are confusing? Well, not really, because I'm pretty sure they're actually really simple and say what they mean, it's girls who like to analyse everything. Why? Because girls always want to come up with a reason why the guy doesn't like them, ect. Anyways, my next question is: Are girls really that scary? If the guy knows that you like him, he would ask you out, right? (Well, that is if he infact likes you back.) But what if you're not quite sure. This is my issue:The teasing never stops (not playground, pulling on ponytails teasing). The conversations that lead to him basically saying he likes you, the smiling, the tapping on the car window just to say "hey" when all of his other buddies are on the other side. Are those not legitamite? Because if they're not, tell me. There's just something about you that gets me all crazy.

      Tip of the day: Eat chocolat while you can! Thought of the day:Nothing's ever what you expect. Even if you think you knew exactly what was going to happen, you really didn't. You had an idea in your head but unless you completely realize that idea all by yourself, it'll never be what you thought it would be. I was thinking of this while I was driving home because my hip hop class got cancelled today because they over booked the studios. I felt bad for the girls. I even went out and bought a new cd for class that day and it ended up being cancelled. It's not just things like that, but everything! Really, when ever you try to plan something out in your mind, you know it's not going to happen.  BP with the girls on Monday! *I don't know where to begin. I don't know how to get out there to see you*

      Well, la journée de l'amour is upon us.  I wonder how many people are extatically happy that it's Valetine's Day, and how many people are crying because it's Valentine's Day.  It's funny the way almost every holiday is bittersweet.   Personally though, I am quite glad it's Valentine's Day, and I don't even have a Valentine. My dad bought me Diana Krall tickets and I'm soooooo excited!!  I hear she's absolutely amaizing in concert and I think it'll be a lovely evening (2nd row grand circle!!).  I was très surprisée! Yesterday was a delightful evening.  Ash and I went to see Win a Date With Tad Hamilton and it was very cute.  I am so inlove with Topher Grace, it's not even funny. And it doesn't help that he completely reminds me of someone else I know, who will remain nameless.  *sigh* I wish he was my valenitine. :P Aaaanywho,  going to see Mr. Kutcher tonight in The Butterfly Efftect.  I am now a movie and music fanatic.  It's strange really.  The French people came yesterday and they're so fun! I wish I was from France.  Brett's exchange partner Hugo is très good-looking.   Supper and O.C with the girls on Monday night, always a good time with them.

      I wonder why? you can type "ahhhh" but that does not in any way convey the emotion of complete frustration.  I can't stand Nathan.  He purposely annoys me, he hits me for absolutely NO reason, and he's rude, obnoxious... have i meantioned annoying and violent?  I mean, I would never be friends with someone like that, yet my whole family expects me to treat him like a friend. whatever.  I'm so frustrated with everything.  People, family, home, school, life.... i just want to cry.  life is such a frustrating mess!  I wish I had a sister.

      Grow courage; the need for courage. Grow perspective; opinion from a perspective you grow. Grow peace, or love.. that grows apart, together, apart forever. Grow imagination, infatuation, more reasonable expectations. A talent; any talent.  Or style; any style.  Just plain grow. Just plain grow up. Grow friends, memories... best friends.  Even enemies. Grow respect, and defeat, and victory ..in pursuit of a dream. Always grow. Grow all ways. ..who's ever really finished anyway?

Those girls are really fun and I hope I made all of the numbers. It'll be so fun! We'll see...  The France exchange peoples come on Friday! Yah! I wonder what they'll be like? We'll have to show them a good old Saskatchewan time (even though I'm not going to France..hmmm). I'm just, you know, friends with everyone that is! Hehehe...I hope Brett's partener coolio. French boyeeee.  Danny is officially odd. Well, not odd in an odd sense but whatever. Sugar in the hair? Pop in the hair? What's with the hair? Obssesed with his hair! Danny, if you read this, sorry but it's true. You know I don't mean much harm.  Oh my, get off my mind! Go away, you're driving me crazy!

      -Jimmy Fallon, comedic genius  I think I saw Monsieur Le C. ont he way home from voice today.... maybe. it wasn't his car, but it looked like him inside it!  wierd. Unfortunately, I did not find out that important piece of information though.  I will try again tomorrow and if that doesn't work, we might have to take drastic measures. *crowd gasps!* The sopranos are ruining my voice. i spent like, 15 minutes today at voice trying to get it to work again. I need to practise that song with kayleigh.  Kayleigh, if you read this, we need to practise the song.  I'm obsessed with BOASAS (see link) it's one of those laugh out loud comics.  ahhh good times. Got Tzeitel in Fiddler!  Horray for me! I'm the oldest mature sister... imagine that.  You can come see it. It's May 10-15th.

      Like, when you want to find something out soooo bad, you don't even care if what you're gonna hear is bad news or not.  You just want to know so you can stop driving yourself mad thinking about it?  That's how I feel.  Went to FAME! today. It was amazing. Serena Katz is my dream role (minimal dancing with a power-house voice).  Thinking again about doing the performing arts college thing.  I always get started on that after I see musicals. grr.  But I must. I now know 4 people going to cuba for the break. I want a hot holiday. My summer is a disaster.  Why? Because even during the one time of the year where I'm supposed to allow myself to relax, I'm not even gonna be at home!!  AND it's the Orangina summer!  When will I be able to tan on my driveway? never. Cause I'm nuts. French rally on Monday!  horray.  I love it.  Chance to be crazy and sing french songs written by grade 12s! Do the.. um, barb dance (for lack of a better name. lol)   *Moi, je crois en francais.... d'ou vien tu? De Walter Murray!* (tune- i believe in miracles) Maybe we'll see cereal boy. lol (new name to add to the list ash. i'll explain if you don't get it.) Off to movie-watch.  toodleoo.

      people don't try. it bothers me. i mean, sometimes i don't try my best but at least it's because i know i don't want to and people know that i don't like some things. you know? well I'll explain... you know when someone's like "this is what i want so bad and there's nothing else in the world that makes me happier." or something along those lines anyways. and then you go and do whatever it is that your doing and they do a half-ass job like they don't even care and wine about it and try to get out of it in some way without anyone noticing that they're trying to get out of it. am i right or am i crazy? i don't understand what goes through peoples heads sometimes. it's like, if you really don't wanna be here, go. it's your choice. go find something else to do that your actually love. maybe that'll get you somewhere.

      -This is an email Alisa sent me, and I thought it was worth sharing! enjoy! :) (I shortened the scroll parts because it was quite long)  Hello, my name is Basmati Kasaar... I am suffering from rare and deadly diseases, poor scores on final exams, extreme virginity, fear of being kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and guilt for not forwarding out 50 billion fucking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on, then that poor fucking 6 year old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her off to the traveling freak show. Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you and everyone you send his email to $1000? How stupid are you? Ooooh, looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get laid by every Playboy Bunny in the magazine! What a bunch of fucking bullshit. So basically, this message is a big FUCK YOU to all the people out there who have nothing better to do than to send me stupid chain mail intelligence and think about what you're actually contributing to by sending out forwards. Chances are it's your own un popularity.  THE FOUR BASIC TYPES OF CHAIN LETTERS:   Chain Letter Type 1:  (scroll down)  > > > Make a wish!!!  > > > Keep Scrolling  > > > No, really, go on and make one!!!  > > > Oh please, they'll never go out with you!!! Wish something else!!!  > > > Not that, you pervert!!  > > > STOP!!!! Wasn't that fun? :) Hope you made a great wish :)   Now, to make you feel guilty, here's what I'll do. First of all, if you don't send this to 5096 people in the next 5 seconds, you will be raped by a mad goat and thrown off a high building into a pile of manure. It's true! Because, THIS letter isn't like those fake ones, THIS one is TRUE!! Really!!!  Here's how it goes:  *Send this to 1 person: One person will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter.  *Send this to 2-5 people: 2-5people will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter.  *Send this to 5-10 people: 5-10 people will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter, and may form a plot on your life.  *Send this to 10-20 people: 10-20 people will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter and will napalm your house.  Thanks!!!! Good Luck!!!   Chain Letter Type 2 : Hello, and thank you for reading this letter. You see, there is a starving little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who has no arms, no legs, no parents, and no goats. This little boy's life could be saved, because for every time you pass this on, a dollar will be donated to the Little Starving Legless Armless Goatless Boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen Fund. Oh, and remember, we have absolutely no way of counting the emails sent and this is all a comp lete load of bullshit. So go on, reach out.  Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds.   Oh, and a reminder - if you accidentally send this to 4 or 6 people, you will die instantly.  Thanks again!!   Chain Letter Type 3: Hi there!! This chain letter has been in existence since 1897. This is absolutely incredible because there was no email then and probably not as many sad pricks with nothing better to do. So this is how it works... Pass this on to 15,067 people in the next 7 minutes or something horrible will happen to you like:  *Bizarre Horror Story #1  Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday. She had recently received this letter and ignored it. She then tripped in a crack in the sidewalk, fell into the sewer, was gushed down a drainpipe in a flood of poopie, and went flying out over a waterfall. Not only did she smell nasty, she died.  This Could Happen To You!!! * *Bizarre Horror Story #2  Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail and ignored it. Later that day, he was hit by a car and so was his boyfriend (hey, some people swing that way). They both died and went to hell and were cursed to eat adorable kittens every day for eternity. * This Could Happen To You Too!!! Remember, you could end up just like Pinsley and Bip. Just send this letter to all of your loser friends, and everything will be okay.   Chain Letter Type 4:  As if you care, here is a poem that I wrote. Send it to all your friends.  FRIENDS:  A friend is someone who is always at your side.  A friend is someone who likes you even though you stink of shit, and your breath smells like you've been eating catfood.  A friend is someone who likes you even though you're as ugly as a hat full of assholes.  A friend is someone who cleans up for you after you've soiled yourself.  A friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry about your sad, sad life.  A friend is someone who pretends they like you when they really think you should be raped by mad goats, then thrown to vicious dogs.  A friend is someone who scrubs your toilet, vacuums and then gets the check and leaves and doesn't speak much English...no, sorry that's the cleaning lady.  A friend is NOT someone who sends you chain letters because he wants his wish of being rich to come true. Now pass this on! If you don't, you'll never have sex ever again!   The point being? If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it. If it's funny, send it on. Don't piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth, who's been tied to a dead elephant for 27 years, whose only savior is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this mail, otherwise you'll end up like Miranda. Right? Now forward this to everyone that you know otherwise you'll find all your knickers missing tomorrow morning!

      -Christina (yes, that one) (her cd's very inspirational you know.. except the 2 dirty songs, but they've got good beats so it's ok)  We have failed. I lasted longer than Ashleigh did though... muaha!  She ate lasagna before I ate those cheesburgers.  I just can't seem to live without meat... I didn't think it'd be that hard.  I am ashamed. I went 4 days, Ash went 3. I got this lipgloss today... that covergirl stuff that lasts for like, a million years.  It's supposed to be "peach pearl" but it looks more like "orange pumpkin" to me.  If I put it on lightly it just looks shimmery and natural, so maybe it won't be a complete waste. Saw a movie tonight on tv.  It had Kiera Knightly (from Pirates) in it, only she was like, 13... or maybe 14.  Crazy!  It was all cute and british and it had a pretty good plot... then it ended. just like that, no warning, no climax, like someone cut off the movie in the middle and put some creits in.  I was QUITE dissapointed.  I don't even know what the name of the show is. Got a callback for Fiddler. Thanks to all you luck-wishers (Ash and Sophie).  Well, it is now bedtime.   ...away laughing on a fast camel

      Live it. Things are looking up, but there's been secrets. Things kept from me. And it's not just one person, it's a couple of people. One I'm definitely not sure about, and the other one just won't tell. I guess it's good, the not knowing part. It's not a big deal at all, it just made me think how much I really know. In general.  It is the passion flowing right on through your veins And it's the feeling that you're oh so glad you came It is the moment you remember you're alive It is the air you breathe, the element, the fire It is that flower that you took the time to smell It is the power that you know you got as well It is the fear inside that you can overcome This is the orchestra, the rhythm and the drum -Nelly Furtado

      How can one thing, that's really not the big a of deal, simple blow up in your face? You say one thing and you get a million answers, and most of them you don't like. They say a picture's worth a 1000 words. Well, I must have had a lot of pictures for all that I got back. I don't get it. I'm on my own. Just me. Well, actually I have lots of people in my life. You guys are awesome! I wish this would all just away...far away. Along with a few other things. ...But some things are good. On the other hand I aced Mr. Math Test today! (

      what is it with boys and girls? i mean, say sally likes ken, and ken likes sally, and they both know that the other one likes them.  why is it that although they know it's there, they feel the need to pretend there's no attraction?  They see each other around and it's like, "hey! what's up?" and all friendly and such.  even though they want to show more, they feel like they can't.  like it would be breaking some sort of unspoken rule.  like, as if even though everyone already knows they like each other, it would be somehow embarassing to admit it.  why are people like that? and the worst part?  everyone does it!  me, ashleigh, and even you.  yes, you.  anyway, something to think about. *If I could say what I wanna say, I'd say i wanna blow you away.... ...yes i'm wishin my life away with these things I'll never say"

      Oh Ricky, Ricky! Wherefore art thou Ricky?  Deny thy bad music and refuse thy title of "two-hit wonder"! --oh, if only Juliet had known Ricky Martin...  Sooo today was a pretty good day. Musical after school.  We f i n a l l y got our schedule! three chhers for Klop---well, let's not go that far, but I was still quite pleased.  Man, I'm missing sooo much work for this.  it better be a good show.  Ah, young love.  Spring is in the air.  I'm so happy that the people around me are happy.   *We are free in our love* So, um, this week is basically singing-free for me and I'm just about going CrAzY!  Tomorrow's the first singing I get and it's *cough*... school choir.  ugh.  The concert choir was in Edmonton last weekend for une festivale.  I hope they had fun.  man, when I was in it, we never got to go to Edmonton.  Like they actually got a time slot on their ittinerary jsut to go shopping!  We didn't even get that when we wre in Spain! "Alright, here we are in a ginormous shopping square in Barcelona... you have 1/2 an hour."  grrr.  Ah well, I hope we get it better than them in Powell River. We should anyway. lol. no chaperones, yay! In other news, I accidentally skipped my voice lesson on Saturday... ahem.  I completely forgot about it!  And the worst part?  What was I doing on Saturday?  Nothing!  Nothing at all!!!  bah.  I skipped voice for doing nothing.  I'd rather be singing.  I want to see the cat duet that kayleigh and i are doing!  "meee-ah-ooooo"  :) In conclusion, I would like to say that today, DJ's icq away message was a mandy moore lyric.  Between Lix Phair and Mandy Moore, what will we do with these boys?

      So today, I walk into my dad's house and it smells like baking... Me:  Hey dad, what's up? Dad:  Oh, I just tried making these buns, but they didn't work out. I'm making banana bread though. Me: Oh sweet (thinking:  what?? ) later....  Dad:  Hey, check out the new clothes I bought.  I got some jeans and some sweaters... these ones look really nice on me, don't you think? Me: (thinking:  what?? )  Last week at my mom's... Mom:  Hey Courtney, I cleaned up your room today because I thought some people were coming over to see the place, But they didn't, so I'll have to clean it again tomorrow.  I kinda liked the mess though... Me:  Oh, thanks mom (thinking:  you liked the mess? what? where's my real mom?!?! )  Everyone's gone to INSANITY!!! so wierd!

      wouldn't it be cool if we could walk on our ceilings? i think so! i was giving this a lot of thought today and really the only thing holding us back is gravity. i think we should come up with a way to not have gravity at a certain spot or time. see, i was thinking like, all we need is something to stick us to the ceiling, but no. we have to make it so the blood doesn't rush to our head! (headache, ect.) so non-gravity machine 'tis!

      so, among other things, we were all sitting around in like a circle, probably for lunch (the school crowd), and all of the sudden lauren has her back to me.  then i was like, hey lauren, what's up? and kind of poked her to turn around, and when she turned around she was alll goth-like with like really dark streaky makeup and black clothes.  then she started writing crazy things on a poster and i don 't remember what it was... and no one noticed that she was acting different, besides me, and ash noticed a little at the end.  anyway, i woke up thinking "nooo laurennn!!!" and then i realized it was just a dream. phew.  last nite was awesome.

      A thought:  So you're at the grocery store and you're in line waiting to pay for your stuff (this is especially applicable if it was a long line) and you get there and the lady (or guy) behind the counter says, "Will that be everything for you today?"  HELLO?  why would I have just stood in line for like, 10 minutes if that wasn't everything??  "No actually, i just came to drop off my stuff... i still need to get some eggs, potatoes, celery and peanut butter.  You wouldn't mind just waiting for me while i pick up those thing would you?"  I mean, really people. think before you talk!  with quesitons like that, there's clearly only one answer.  Example #2:  "Can I ask you a question?" well what am i gonna say?  "No, actually, I would prefer if you didn't." Obviously people don't ask that expecting a no.  Or, "Can I borrow a piece of looseleaf?"  Borrow?  Why would you want to borrow looseleaf?  Are you just gonna stare at it or something?  Cause I sure don't want it back if you're planning on writing on it.   Just something to think about. Have a pleasant day :)

      "Shake your body...Shhhhhhhake your body!" I'm lovin' it! So, I didn't go to the gathering last night. Oh well! I'm way to tired. Really, I don't know how I'm still living. Well, yes I know why, but whatever. See, the over-tiredness causes me to think way to much. Everyone come to the fashion show next Saturday (March 27th) since that's one of the big reasones I'm tired. Tickets are on sale at Murray! Meagan came up with a new way (well, it's not really way) but a new version of spelling my name (since most people like to get it wrong): Asch. What is that? It's like pronounced the same as "Ash" but she spelt it "Asch". Silly Meagan. She did it twice too. Midnight movie tonight! I think we're going to see "You Got Seve". Hahaha...looks pretty dumb but hey, that's what midnight movies are all about! Maybe I can pick up some sweet dance moves out of it. Par-teh! I like and dislike how I'm feeling right now. I'm happy and cheery because well, dance is going good, school's not bad, four day weekend rocks and well, my life's pretty darn good. I just don't like the feeling of being uncertain. Well, not really uncertain, but there's not really a better word for it. It's like waiting for something to happen, but you kind of know it's going to happen, but your never really sure because nobody can know anything for sure. I'm even confusing myself.

      Bah!!!  I HATE when people do stupid things.  not like, tripping on a shoelace or something, but really stupid things.  important things.  things that completely go against every value they've ever had.  i especially hate it when those people are people who are close to me, who i don't want to get hurt.  I'm so upset at this.  I mean, do you not REALIZE that this one little decision affects your ENTIRE LIFE??  do you not care?  why whould you do it anyway?  to be cool? to have friends?  WRONG! listen up buddy, if you have to do shit like that to be popular with your group, find a different group!!  i mean, what is it about them that keeps you coming back?  why bother?  because they think they're cool?  they appear to have "confidence"?  ha.  you had confidence once. cool confidence.  the type that everyone liked. everyone thought was awesome.  it's leaving now.  people ask me where you've gone?  i ask myslef that sometimes too.    "It's a fight, it's a fight and you finally belong, got a shiner now and it's more than a battle scar, more than a battle scar, such a good good story to tell  at lunch break lunch break lunch break lunch break, such a good good story to tell. You bully, you break, you bully you break, you fake you fake you fake you fake.  you smoke you toke you walk you flaunt, you hit it and you're in it and it's spinning, and it's wild.  we never thought that we'd get caught up, stuck in the teenage waste as we explode." --Nelly Furtado

      I'm feeling like myself today. No sickness, no headache, no stressing, just me. If I've been acting weird this week, I'm sorry. Everything was going crazy and I really didn't know what to do about it. It's like my whole world was being thrown at me and I wasn't strong enough to throw it back. But it's all good now.   Spa night was fun (expect I didn't really expirience the "Spa" part of it) but it was a good time. Courtney and Haylie were crazy at the bball game! I love you guys, you know I do. Wow, I mean, me and Courtney can get prett crazy, but put those two in a room and watch out! "I'm number...*cough*...three." Good times.

      I believe in you! You'll get what you want someday. Someday that cereal will be all yours! Never give up on your dreams little rabbit because everyone is still a little kid on the inside. I'm so very glad that this week is finished! I've been up and down and in and out and here and there and practically everywhere mentally and physically! Saturday will be awesome! I'm looking forward to some good, quality girl time. So, b-ball game first off and then to Adria's. I think everyone needs a break. Dance is buggin me. Don't know why yet. It's definitely not the people (well, maybe those who never like to show up) but still, I love them all. I think it's just getting really repetative and I'm kinda bored. Well, not in some classes but in most. I'll be happy when my exam is over and done with. Ah!!! That'll be crazy. "And I see you standing there, I'm all I'll ever be, and all I can do is try" I love that song. (Nelly Furtado) Sometimes I wish I could read peoples thoughts. Only for a second. Or know what they're feeling or even what they were doing before you saw them or talked to them. What goes through their head. What they think of you. Maybe that wouldn't be all that good because then there'd be no game. No guessing and laughing and planning. So I guess I just wish people would say things straight up. Including myself, but sometimes I get scared off. We should all try to be ourselves, honest and open.

      Well, today was a good day.  Good musical practise.... it only gets beter from here! :) I've discovered something in the last couple days.  People are much more appealing to me when they don't try to be someone they're not... no matter who they are.  I'm not sure about this person... it seems like they're always trying to please.... makes me wonder. well, i'll reserve judgement until i know them better, but sometimes i just feel like saying "who are you really??  be real!!!" Well, there's my little rant of the day... i guess it wasn't that bad.  it's still a bit frustrating though. Well Ash, i think at this point i might be in the same spot as you en ce qui concerne boys. bah!  i hate them. love to hate em... no, hate to love em. :P Well, talked to Michelle yesterday.  I'm feeling so much better lately.  no more anger.  it's lovely.  maybe it also has to do with spring... i love spring.

      The Darkness are very cool in a non-cool way. It's weird cause, they dress all 8o's and they have bad teeth and bad hair and a really bad music video, yet it's tres cool. Today I bought Sarah her b-day gift. She's turining 21, so I got her what any 21-year-old we want: a Care Bears card and a big gerber daisy! If you know Sarah, you know that's it's completely her style. Happy Birthday to you! Embarassing moment: Falling on my butt in the middle of the student parking lot today at lunch. I now have a big bruise. It hurt so bad but it must have look hilarious since my feet practically went over top of my head! I would have laughed at myself if I could have. What should I bring for girls night #2 at Adria's house? (food)

      today was a typical day at school. well, sort of typical. i guess every day is different so you don't really have normal days (but people should still come to school! lol) anyways, adria lent me Catcher in the Rye. it should be good. it's on my list of things to do before i'm 30 (reading it, that is). i got through two chapters today in francais. we also discussed our girls night #2 coming up this weekend. (if your coming you have to bring food and i think we're all just gonna stay the night at adria's). mickey d's tomorrow for lunch. or any other place for that matter. it's so much better when you get out of the school for a bit. anyone who wants to come can tag along. it's so beautiful outside! i love this weather! question of the day: what are some great movies?

      I had to dance this morning at 9:30. Me and Haylie went for McDucks breakfast (Mmm...some people don't like it but it's like, my favorite breakfast!). I'm so tired. I'm kind of in that half sweaty half dry skin mode and my feet really hurt along with my eyes being itchy. Dance later tonight, but Cabaret is always a good time.  On the way home I was stuck behind yet another senior citizen. Me and Haylie were in my vehicle and then Kim was in her VW and Whitney and Jill were in the car and we all try to beat each other to the fork where we split. Well, I was stuck behind this guy who took so long to make a right turn it was driving my insane! I mean, who needs a whole minute to turn a corner?  So I still don't have things figured out for sure but I'm not worried about it. I was talking to Kim today and she gave me the heads up so I think everything will be fine. It still makes me smile.

      -deep thought by Ashleigh and Courtney  Today was a horrible school day. I mean, who takes 3 tests in one day? I do, that's for sure. It was crazy and I'm really hoping I passed all of them. Oh school, what will we do with you? On the way to dance I was driving behind this senior citizen who was driving 25 km/h. 25! Should those kind of people still have a license to drive? Shouldn't that be like, against the law? It took him a whole minute to turn the corner.  People can be really kind. (I know I just sent a lot of you a forward that says people are annoying. Read it! It's so good! But anyways...) In general, people can be really nice. Like this guy who was walking by the Juliette's parking lot saw that I was trying to back out (Ok, there was a car right behind me and I was trying to get around it) so he came and directed me through it. That was really nice of him.  My weekend is really busy. Basically, I have a lot of dance, but then everyone's coming over on Saturday night. Invite everyone cause it really doesn't matter to me. I'm also looking forward to Monday (even though I usually hate Mondays).

      -The new song of the century... best thing ever.  So, right now I'm on my 5th period spare... sitting in the library...  just lovely.  End of the day and I get to sit in the library and do nothing while I wait for the day to end, so I  can go to a musical readthru!  hoorah! Anyway, the library is most definitely the place to be during a spare. it's like a different party everytime! :) lol Today it was some basketball boys for awhile.  We've decided Jared's gonna get a shopping cart to push around the school so he doesn't have to carry his binder. lol.  Nathan just came by... he got kicked out of english.  what a delinquent!  Who colors the entire back of their hand with permanent marker anyway??  crazy kid.  Ah yes... the library is a lovely place.  Mme Collard's running around looking a little bit frustrated.  Maybe it's because she's here with a bunch of annoying little grade nines.  I wonder if we were that annoying in grade nine?  *Aux armes citoyens,  Formez vos bataillons  Marchons, marchons  Qu'un sang impur  Abreuve nos sillons* Today was a good day... a little bit stressful maybe, but now that's it's over, i can look back on it and smile, because it's good to know sometimes that the past is unchangeable. lovely. well, i'm off

It was then passed to me for a potential point but what a second, the ball gets stuck on the line and the judges are deciding which team gets it. In other news: Too many tests tomorrow! Crazy!

      well, days like this don't just come around every... day.  started off boring and tired, but hey, the history test was moved... even though i'm gonna be just as unprepared tomorrow, but it's all good.  so  much due tomorrow.  if you're caitlin and you're reading this, i'm sorry i didn't finish the fact sheet!!  I'll do it all tonite if you want, i mean, it's my fault it's not done.   anyway, the end of the day was the best part for me, even though i j u s t about fell asleep in the library reading about soap... (i'm so glad we don't have to present tomorrow!!!) then i got some news.  someone's been lying.  well, we're more awake now, i can guarantee that.  oh the smiling. I love spring.   *...oh happy day,  oh happy day , when jesus washed,  when jesus washed , he washed my sins away.   oh happy day ...* ...i luuurrve that song!!  i can't wait to start it in choir!  there's a musical readthru tomorrow after school.  usually readthrus aren't the funnest, but tomorrow should be pretty fun.  i'm really excited for musical to really start.  the intensive rehearsal are the best (the most annoying, but the best) and my absolute favorite part is the all day dress rehearsals etc when you jsut get together and everything almost finished and everyone's really nervous/excited and people who didn't know eachother before are like, really good friends and everyone's happy.  i just love musical.   Intensive choir on sunday. 130-630.  woop woop!  and it's a pizza supper and alll i have to do for the whole day is stand around and play percussion! yess!  no choreography for moi! :)  well, today was a gooder.. hopefully more like it in the future! :)

      Math workshop today = alright. The math, it still needs work on my part. I mean, I can't say I'm genius quite yet. He was a cool Prof. though. Ah the Irish. I couldn't believe that a face could go that red! I mean, should that be treated or something? He's really smart of course so tat makes up for it. I don't know if I'm smart. Maybe....Anyways, "secret" plan has to come into play soon. Jay can't be subtle at all. Ah well, the master plan will be coming soon and you won't even know it. Ma ha! So the workshop ended up being a good time with those guys. Spring is in the air I tell you! Party at Adria's tonight! I can't believe how tired I am. I should really be sleeping. I'm surprised that I ddin't actually fall asleep during francais. They were (they as in Mr. Roy and Iain. The nme somtimes) discussing hockey so I had to get a few words in. It was useless though because well, it's them.  The Frenchies are leaving tomorrow! I'll miss them ya, I mean, things got a little interesting when they were here. Crazy Europeans (and I mean that in a good way). Jo, if you're reading this, nice blog.

      Ash-- it's "lying on our back and countin' the stars..."  but whatever. :P  Anyway,  some confusion lately about certain things.  I've never really experienced a situation like this one before, so I figure maybe I'll just go with the flow and see where it leads me.  The flutterflies are back though and I love them.  It's worth it just for the warm feeling in my tummy.  My life is so up and down these days, who knows where it'll take me?   Well, Ash and I got new tshirts.  They are excellente.  Mine says "no music no life" and Ash's says "come as you are".  Both quite good picks if I do say so myself.  I lurrve shopping. Speaking of that funny feeling,  it's almost spring then, isn't it?  Hard to believe, but you can tell.  I mean, I can tell, especially with certain people I know who are talking more and more about the different boys they like.  it's quite fun I think.  Always an adventure.   Math thing tomorrow.  Stupid stupid.  What were we thinking??  I guess if I'm gonna take math in university though... but still.  I would rather be sleeping in History. but, c'est la vie!

"A dream is a wish your heart makes  When you're fast asleep  In dreams you lose your heartaches  Whatever you wish for, you keep   Have faith in your dreams and someday  Your rainbow will come smiling through  No matter how your heart is grieving  If you keep on believing  The dream that you wish will come true"  SOPHIE COMES TOMORROW!!!

      Well, here I sit... on the fence.... well, not really. i'm actaully in a chair in front of the computer and i'm feeling pretty not-so-nice.  Much must too stressed to live the next 3 weeks.... maybe i'll jsut sleep through them and come out happilly on the other side. hmm.... catch ya on the flip side.  that actually makes alot of sense you know. I wonder about people. They always tell you to open up to them... "If  you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here for you."  Honestly, there are very few people who actually follow through on that. And there are some, don't get me wrong.  But most of the time when i try to get stuff off your chest and it just turns into the "my problems are bigger, my life is more stressful, and i deserve more sympathy than you" game.  When really, you don't want sympathy, you just want someone to listen.  So you don't come out feeling better, you come out feeling like your problems are insufficient and that no one really cares.  I hate that stupid game!!!! Well, here's the musical update: it sucks.  we'd be ready if we had maybe.... another 3 week.... extra i mean.  if you're planning on coming, come at the end of the run.  Well, here's an update on music festival: i don't think i'll win any of my classes.  butt i'm excited for kayleigh who is most likely going to win her musical thater class.... oh, well we might win our lieder class... if we work hard to beat alexandra... ask me about that sometime. good night all, and have a pleasant evening.

      I amazing how lyrics cna really touch you. I bought the Maroon 5 cd today (thanks to Court) and it's so good. Wow, what a talented bunch of guys! Court, my favorite song is She Will Be Loved too. In NB I watched a group do there lyrical line to a song called Why. It touched me so much it's was incredible. It wasn't even the dancing, it was the song and the way they moved with it. I was crying so hard and shaking for so long, I don't think I've ever been that emotional about something I've watched before.  Wow, I wish that we had more of a break. It was so great! Everything was awesome. I craved eggs benedict for most of the week. You see, we were eating fast food almost every day (man, that did not feel to good so no more fast food for a long time) and finally on Friday we went to Humpty's (all-day breakfast) and I got my eggs. Mmm, so good. Besides the dancing we did a lot of shopping because if you're a dancer they like to give you big discounts so everything was on sale. I love being a dancer! It was a good week.  I had to clean out my room today. Well, not completely but throw away all the "junk" and "crap" as my parents would put it. It was kinda sad, but everything is nice and neat now. I'm really excited to move. I'll have to have everyone over once we're all moved in (which isn't until like June).

      North Battleford here we come! Yah! Tomorrow night's Love Is A Crime and Red Hot Rock. Should be really good cause it's all jazz. Wednesday is CABARET night! Yay! "Hello, my name is Champagne and I am here to entertain you." I think I'm looking forward to that one the most!!! Oh, and shooping on Wednesday cause all these stores give you discounts if your dancing in the competition! Sweet, hey? Then Thursday is lyrical solo, Stole and My Vietnam. Oh my gosh, I love My Vietnam so much, I hope we do really well! Then hopefully (cross your fingers) that we get into Showcase on Friday. Yay! Well, i'm be gone all week, back Friday night.

      I miss them!  And then there were seven...Aw, airports are so sad. I mean, they're only gone for three weeks, but really, it's going to be three very long weeks.Before they all went through security it got kind of emotional. I don't know why, but it just feels like they were leaving us for good. And then they came to the glass. You can't hear anything from there but we saw them and we all had tears in our  eyes. I had a big lump in my throat and when Caitlin and Cortney starting crying, I couldn't help myself. I hope this time goes by fast cause I love them all and meanwhile, us girls will have each other!

      --right Caitlin? hehe   Anywho, just got back from voice and I would just like to announce that I've found my musical theater song for next year.  It's from Wicked... I love Wicked.  And Kayleigh says it's coming to Toronto next year, so I must see it... and that's all there really is to it.  Anyway, the song's called Popular... and everyone should download it and listento it right now.  It's amazing.  Well, thinking alot about things lately... feeling a little bit dull.  ...well not really dull...just well, kind of like the weather.  Very apathetic.  Even though I love rain sooo much.  Things are tres crazy.  My voice recital is on Saturday... then dance recital (more so for Ash) next weekend, school ends in 2 1/2 weeks, then exams, then  voice exam !! (for those of you who I haven't already told).   I'm making tomorrow Warm Fuzzy day.  Say something nice to everyone you see... even if you don't feel like it.  Because it can't hurt to make someone else smile... and chances are you'll feel better too!   *Blithe smile, lithe limb She who's winsome, she wins him Gold hair with a gentle curl That's the Girl he chose And heaven knows I'm Not That Girl* Another song from Wicked (and the story of my life)... such a good musical.

      Well, right now I'm sitting at work... I know, I'm so bad, but it's friday so whatcha gonna do about it?  only 36 minutes until my weekend commences!  woop woop.  So yesterday was Ashleigh's birthday, and if you haven't already wished her a happy birthday, I suggest you do it now.  Yes, you... right now.   Well, it's raining outside and isn't that marvelous?  I think it is.  I also think the word marvelous is marvelous.  So, as we speak, there are 3 (possibly 4) girls in my basement who are not me, who are using my house to work on their project. You're strange ones, you are.  WELL, (and i have started every paragraph with "well" so i figure, why stop now?) tonght is grad and it makes me think towards next year.... i don't wanna graduate!!!  Even just the thought of having to plan for my (dun dun DUUUN) future scares the shit out of me.  I have no idea what i'm gonna do, and I like being undecided, thank you very much!  grrr.  and the reason i can't go to see "Grease" is becasue it's the weekend before my grad... that scares me even more because i don't think of Grease as being that far away! WELL, on a lighter note, I'm going to TWO musicals this year!  SO excited! Kayleigh just got back from Toronto, seeing "The Producers" and "Hairspray" (her bday present) and she said they were awesome. I'm so jealous.  WELL, I find my self crushing... just a little bit, but nevertheless crushing.  What inconvenient timing.   WELL, off to waste the rest of my day. 29 minutes left!

So thanks so much from the bottom of my little heart.  MWAH!   *People were worried. They knew these two brought out the worst in each other. Their friendship was unconditional and dangerous.

      I got this forward from a friend and I really liked it so here it is: ONE. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.  TWO. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.  THREE . Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.  FOUR . When you say, "I love  you,"mean it.  FIVE. When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.  SIX. Be engaged at least six months before you get married. SEVEN. Believe in love at first sight.  EIGHT. Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.  NINE. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.  TEN. In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling.  ELEVEN. Don't judge people by their relatives  TWELVE.. Talk slowly but think quickly.  THIRTEEN. When someone asks you a question and you don't want to answer, smile and ask, "Why do you want to know?"  FOURTEEN. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.  FIFTEEN. Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.  SIXTEEN. When you lose, don't lose the lesson  SEVENTEEN. Remember the three R's: R espect for self; R espect for others; and R esponsibility for all your actions.  EIGHTEEN. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.  NINETEEN. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.  TWENTY. Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your voice.  TWENTY-ONE. Spend some time alone.  Ps. Chack out the 80's picture below

      If you ever want to scare someone, laugh at someone, if you're ever mad at someone, confused, hyper, or even feeling mellow start barking. I assure you it'll make you're day a whole lot better! (Courtney--> if you don't come to school tomorrow maybe come for like 10 minutes and clean some stuff out of the locker. only if you want to of course. love ya!) AH! I can't believe school is almost over! I mean, we still have like 5 weeks left, but when Mr. Earl was talking about preparing for finals and everything I got to thinking how fast it's going to go! We're almost seniors... He wore his glasses today. Courtney, any comments? Hockey camp is always fun times. Saw a couple of the boys today while driving to the rink. Lol...hhh FIDDLER on Saturday! I'm excited to see this thing! I've heard way too much about it and I need to see it. In other news, 80's DAY is on Friday! *cough* That should be interesting....LOL! I really don't know what's going on in Mr. Francy Pants' head. Anyways, dress up everyone! And we're all making a trip to DairyQueen in our HOT 80's outfits to celebrate!

      Well, not the happiest of days.... but the wounds will heal, I promise.  Man, sometimes life is shitty... that's all there really is to it. My ears are always for listening, but you know that. Music festival is over! Came out with 3 firsts, a second and an A.  So that's not too bad... so glad it's over though!  Kayliegh sang at the best of the festival last night and she was really fantastic.  Being sick is really crappy, but it was all good in the end.   It's Mother's Day today... so be sure to thank your moms for being amazing.  They really are, aren't they?  Man, I don't know what I'd do without mine.  Tomorrow Fiddler starts.  2 shows on Monday... I'm not quite sure what to think... all my scenes are excellente.. except maybe the wedding, but tis ok. Anyway, the point I'm getting to here.... come!  bring all your friends,  and tell them to tell all their friends to come too!  we need a million more ticket sales.  yes, a million.  so please come... it might not be the best musical you've ever seen, but meh.  so yes, come.  it's every night this week at 730... tickets are available at the door.  thank you! :) Anywho, that all for today. *...Take a breath, Feel the beat in the rythm of my steps. And sometimes it's a sad song...*

      Everything's been so busy lately I'm surprised that I could find the time to sit down and write a blog! I'ts kinda nice to relax oce in a while... Elections finished yesterday and I'm very happy with our Sr. Ring and Pin picks (since I voted for both of 'em). Me and Sadia are having a good time campagning. I hope we win! I think we actually have a pretty good shot now. Go us!  I'm in the middle of filling out my summer school forms. I'm really excited! And no, I'm not taking actual summer school, it's dance school! Hahaha, it's going to be so great! As long as I get all these things in tonight! Ah! I'm gonna be gone for a long time though...I'll miss everyone...but that's not for a while. Me and Caitlin bought "Fiddler on the Roof" tickets yesterday and I'm very anxious to see this musical! I've heard so much about it. Not necessarily good stuff, but lots. It should be a good time. I mean, we have to support the WMCI music department! Dance is so crazy right now! Madame has oficially gone into "Gala Mode"--(not just regular Gala Mode) The time of year when she stresses about everything, if you don't show up to class you get an evil death threat, if you touch a costume you get a mean beating, if you drop a prop you're in debt and if anything gets anymore complicated we'd all be in trouble. The best thing to do is to keep your mouth shut unless spoken to and just find a happy place.

I'm so excited because there's a youth choir from New Zealand and a choir from Nicaragua coming!  The one from Nicaragua is called Christ The King Chirch Choir and they're all like, black and spiritual and I'm so excited to meet them! Choir tour is absolutely the best part of summer. SO, campfire tonite @ Mlle J's house... call first if you are planning on arriving! :) There will be smores and marshmallows and lots of fun! I will also be bringing what's left of Ashleigh's pool party pictures so come if want a picture! :) Well, that's all for today my friends!  Have a pleasant rest-of-the-week. xoxo

      It is now 1:52 am... i'm still awake even though I should really be sleeping, hence my very tired eyes, but i don't really want to sleep right now.  and if not this, then what's summer for?  nothing, that's what.   So, we got no commetns on our last posts... stupid stupids who don't like to comment. :P  Well, I would just like to say that Thursday was one of the best ever days.  What a way to kick off summer!  Thanx to J for hosting the awesomest pool party yet.  We'll have to have another one to maybe end off summer, no?  One downside to Thursday's pool party, and probably the only thing I would complain about, is that I am covered in very nasty bruises.  I have one huge on on my knee and since danny pushed me into the pool, I can't wear shoes with backs cause the backs of myheels are purple.  Well, that's not really a complaint... I actually like bruises, but I still think people should feel sorry for me and my battle wounds. Overall, it was one of the funnest days ever and Ash got some greatness pictures so you should ask her to see them when she gets back from LA/Calgary.  They rock. Speaking of miss Ashleigh, she's off to LA tomorrow... GOOD LUCK ASH!  I would be SO fricken scared if I were you.... so hats off and maybe I'll make you a medal or something for bravery. Well, school is officially OVER for the summer.  I hae to say, I never thought this would come, and now that it's here it feels  so  nice!  I love summer soooo much.  And I'm so pumped for BC... it'll be the most definite highlight... that and Ontario... can't wait to sit by the pool in the swealtering heat... maybe I'll even surprise you all with some kick ass funky new hair...   Anyway, enough rambling for tonite... off to bed! xoxo

      Summer is finally here! Finals are over, the weather  is getting nicer and I'm getting closer and closer to my trip!  Yesterday was great start to summer. My final went really well and I had an incredible afternoon! Sometimes things don't work out exactly how you planned it because nobody ever knows how things are going to work out. But it's really great when what you planned doesn't even compare to what you have. Summer sweetness. *we're only seven miles from the sun* Pool party on Thursday! (*note that it's been changes to Thursday instead of Friday). Last @ Jay's house was a good time driving to pick up Lang, playing some b-ball (lol), shooting pool and watching a movie. Abu's our hero! Ps. If you didn't read it already, read the post below about Courtney's awesome driving skills. Love ya!

      This is a momentus day for two reasons.  It's the first day of summer and this very post is the 111th on our blog!  Yay us! And, no I didn't go through and count them all... we do have a little thing that tells us how many posts we've done.  Anyway, hooray for us and our bloggy-ness. So today I woke up at like, 7 (its my first day of summer btw... no exam) so I could go to work because one of the girls wasn't supposed to be there today.  Well, I got there and guess what? She was there.  So I turned right around and came back home.  Everyone felt really bad, but honestly, I'm not upset.  Maybe a little tired, but I'm sure not gonna let it ruin my day. Funny story: Yesterday was a little French study party at A's house, so I decided, for lack of anything better to do, I'd bring them slurpees as a little break.  Cause, I mean, I know if I was studying I'd like it if someone bought me a slurpee.  So anyway, there I am, at Mac's, six slurpees in hand.  I have drink trays of course, but have you ever tried to carry a full slurpee drink tray?  Well, believe me, this is not an easy task.  So I manage to get them out to my car.  I put one drink tray on the seat and two in the cup holders.  Now, turning left out of Mac's is at kind of a tough intersection,  so I pretty much had to boot it to get accross and onto the right side of the road.  Over go the slurpees.  I look over and I'm like, "WAH!"  so I'm trying to pick up the ones that are like, upside down so they'll stop emptying on my car, and trying to drive at the same time...  looking at the seat, driving, look, drive, hand on wheel, other hand on slurpees, driving... look down, oh, drive up onto the meridian.  Yes, that's right. So picture me, in my car, half-on the meridian freaking out cause there's slurpees everywhere and people driving by and looking because i mean, come on, what kind of a freak drives into the meridian and stays there?  Moi.  So anyway, all turned out fine, it wasn't too hard to clean up, everyone still got most of their slurpee and all was happy in the end.  Just another little adventure from your friends at our blog.   Well, hope everyone has a very enjoyable first day of FREEDOM and hopefully warm weather soon.

      Happy Father's Day!  I hope everyone has shown their father some father's day-ish love and appreciation today!  :) Well, I've been thinking alot about humanity and kindness and giving and all things good and selfless lately.  Another American was beheaded yesterday.  That makes me sick.  Nothing justifies treating another human being like that.   Nothing.  And some people will say, well, you should see what the Americans are probably doing to them... well, the Americans aren't justified either.  It makes me feel so sick. Does it make you a good person if you simply try to teach people about kindness and acceptance and then never practice it?  If one of your friends was at a difficult time in their life, would you turn your back on them right when they needed you the most?  Especially if you represent and important figure in their life?  Is it right to say you'll show love to all people in need, but then exclude someone from that because the reason of their hurt is something you don't agree with?  Is that justified?  What would  you  do?   I will never be one of those people. I will never understand that.  Never. *When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it* *When you say I'm sorry, look the person in the eye* *Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship* *Remember the three R's:  R espect for self,  R espect for others,  R esponsibility for all your actions*

      Life can throw you all kinds of surprises, like you could end up with a big work-load when you have a fun weekend planned or someone could give you a free escape, ect. You get the idea. And then there are those times when you're so blinded by what might happen, but the outcome is incredible. You could just be pulled by the arm, expecting a different reaction and you get, "Wow, what just happened?". The outcome always seems to be bittersweet, but isn't it nice when there's a lot more sweetness.  While we're on the subject, Gu's b-day party was a good time! I think we ended up spending most of it outside, which was great cause the house was so humide. I hope he enjoys he gift. *Girls, everyone except for Adria and Courtney still owe me some money for the gift*. Lol one of the best parts: going on te journey and getting waves from the freeway people! Oh, and how is it that whenever we're all together we end up vandelizing or switching vehicles? Or next event: POOL PARTY!

So I'm at work again and it's Friday, and guess what? It's my 3rd last day here. It will be sad to leave cause I really like working here.  So yesterday there was ths big shin dig dwn in the rec room at work for the unveiling of our core values. it was awesome.  The punch was excellent. So yesterday. Ah yesterday... Asheligh came over around 730 to study for math and ended up sleeping over...ahem. 'nuff said?  In short, we got really realy really caffeine wired and then studied till 3... yes, 3. then woke up at 7. I'm so confused right now about boys... I'll never understand what goes through their minds and why they feel the way they do and why it makes me so damn sad.  Je les detestes. Well, off to Gu's bdays party tonite... should be a good time. I quite like birthdays... not to mention the kick-"ass" gift we got him hehehe (queen of puns!  queen of puns!)  Anyway, I'm off to get ready for le par-tay!

      My parents are in London, probably having the time of their lives. I should go to London, it would be like being Georgia Nickleson. They called when I was out with the other half. I was upset that I didn't get to talk to them because they still don't know about my show and my scholarship. I hope they took a picture of a guard for me...I asked them too. I've always thought that London would be so amazing to see. I would love it there...It's just one of those places that must be incredible. It would be such a disappointment if it wasn't. Finals are going on right. Ugh...Here's the cycle: Studying all afternoon, eat, all night, nap, study in the morning, go home, eat, study all afternoon,....ect. Biology tomorrow! Yah! (I'm trying to make finals fun! It's not really working, but I'm trying...) My grandparents are staying with us while my parents are away. A few quotes from today. So my grandpa is playing FreeCell on the computer (he's obsessed with the game and has a goal to play every single game) my bro wanted to get on the computer I here,"Oh piss off!". My grandpa's very possessive. And tonight at supper, we're all kind of finished eating so my grandma is cleaning up and I'm sitting at the table and my bro grabs his b-ball and starts, you know, bouncing it off the wall. It got really annoying after a while so I just tried to get a b-ball out of his hands. My grandma looks at me and says (very sincere), "Don't worry about it dear, he 's just a little mentally retarded." I almost killed myself laughing! Things have gotten to the point where I might just ride away laughing on a fast camel.

      So, things have been quite the crazy this week. Last week of school! I'm kinda excited and kinda afraid. finals start on tuesday, so that should be interesting. No fifth period rocks, cause my summer starts 3 days before everyone else's! muahaha.   My voice exam's 2 weeks from tomrrow!! I'm so scared for it... I don't really know what to think. I need to start some insane practising because I really need to pick up my technical. Anyway, it seems like I should be so ready since I've been planning for it since September, but I don't feel very ready at all... hopefully I won't fail.  Next year's musical= Bugsy Malone. Ms. Kalapaca is directing... I'm not sure how I feel about that. I mean, she'll do a good job, but I still wish Mr. Riley would direct, because directing is about more than just blocking scenes and organizing rehearsals. We need some guidance acting-wise too. Mr K didn't give us much of that.  Ah well, whatever it is, I'm sure it will be fun. Hardy is either doing Little Shop of Horrors (most likely) or Into The Woods.  Both good musicals... both rather hard to do in highschool. *Bop shoo bop, Little Shop of Horrors, bop shoo bop...* Got my Wicked soundtrack! It's amazing! Dance recital is on Saturday nite, in case you missed Ash's last post... it's 20$... @ 730. Everyone should come.  In this week's news: Phone calls from a strange boy who I didn't give my number to.... tracking me, C and C down for our email addresses.  I must say I find it slightly creepy that he phoned my house 8 times.  :S    Some flutterflies are making their way into my tummy...  As for our observations, I still have no idea girls.  we'll have to rotate spots to see if the reaction is different.   Well, until next time, on a scale from one to awesome, I'm super cool. ps. If you read this, please comment! :)

      I got an hour and a half break form dance today, so I decide to write down some stuff: This is the final week... It seems like it's that last week before everything is going to get crazy. School is almost done. I'm gonna be a senior next, wow, it seems kind of surreal you know? Next year I have to start looking for places to live, jobs, schools...everything's gonna change. This week is my last week of dance too! Wow, I'm so extremely excited for my show, and everyone should come because it's going to be great!  Really great!  If you don't have tickets, tell me, and give me some money and I'll get you a ticket!  I got all my info for L.A. today! It's going to be amazing! I've been looking forward to this for so long it's hard to imagine that it's coming so soon. Even with everything going on right now...I wish I still had anothor month here. Maybe that would be better...I really don't know what would be better though. It's weird how life can change so fast. One day your just doing your thing and the next you have no clue. It's hard, for everyone, I miss you. I finally know, and nobody else does, so it can only come from me. "Some Good Things" I posted earlier this month. I'm reminded of a few lately: 3. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.  8. Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.  9. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.   14. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.  16. When you lose, don't lose the lesson  19. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.  21. Spend some time alone.

Lots of love, wish you were here, wish you were her! hahaha...., Azule XOXO

      My birthday was last Thrusday and my 17th year has begun! Yay! I woke up and I felt differnt, I don't know why, but I did. Every moment from then has been great! I had an awesome Friday, a kick-ass weekend and so far, my week has been quite enjoyable. For some reason I haven't been upset or dissapointed, I'm just happy a lot and I think it's cause I'm seventeen! You probably all think I'm absolutely crazy...Well, I probably am just a little but I'm having a great time being here so there's nothing wrong with that! Kayleigh was in the paper (Kayleigh, if you're reading this you're awesome in every way, we still have to do something and your name is spelt to PERFECTION!). Everyone read the article. Me and Court have a copy in our locker! On the way home from Courtney's I saw a very big man driving a very small, very pink car. Problem: Whenever I come on the computer, and when I had left the computer my msn was OFF, I'm all of a sudden online and people are trying to talk to moi and je ne suis pas la! C'est terrible! Mon dieux! There must be a ghost the lives in my house. Dance was wonderful today! I was doing our Waltz of the Flowers and the younger girls were watching and they give us such cute comments afterwards and they're just in awe when they're watching us dance. It's so wonderful! *Tickets for my dance recital are on sale now. Talk to me if you want one...or more! It's Saturday June 12th at 730*

            Happy and sad to be home. My trip was so GREAT! Everything was awesome! I have so many stories you're all just gonna have to ask me about it when you see me. I'm sad to not be dancing anymore...    I hope everyone's summer has be awesome!     Story from Long Beach #47: Annika and Elizabeth walking under the tunnel. Hear a big crash/thud sound. Wonder what it is? Get out if the tunnel, walking along the path and boom!...big dead crow falls out a the tree.

       ...it was quite gross.&nbsp; I actually killed more than one.&nbsp; the first one was this cockroachy sort of thing, the second was the most spastic fly i've ever seen.&nbsp; it was so crazy.&nbsp; but ew... the only bugs i don't mind killing are mosquitos and maple bugs.&nbsp; that's it.&nbsp; ugh.  Anywho, onto some real stuff... today i took a field trip. to get N's contacts, then to WalMart to drop of pictures and i also bought some lipgloss.&nbsp; Yes, that is the most boring part of my day.  In more exciting news....  1. I got a tan!&nbsp;  Finallement  my wait is over!!&nbsp; summer has arrived... and just in time too, as i'm going to camp on Sunday.  2. I blew up my whale pool today!&nbsp; You know, the one Mary gave me for my birthday last year?... ok well maybe you didn't know, but you do now!&nbsp; ...Anyway, that's not the point.&nbsp; the point is, it's brilliant!&nbsp; I brought it over for the little girl I was babysitting today,&nbsp; and like, man this pool is amazing.&nbsp; it squirts water up!!&nbsp; It's so fetch (new word, saw mean girls last nite and every one should see it! it's hilarious.&nbsp; Hats off Tina Fey!)  Well, that's all for today... and probably for awhile.&nbsp; Off to camp soon!&nbsp; campcampcamp! :D&nbsp;  Later alligator&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well, i'm HOME!!  And I don't feel like doing much of anything right now cause I'm soooo tired. I just talked to Ashleigh on the phone and then we got cut off but that's ok because I got to talk to her and I really really needed to.  Just about went crazy the other night from being around people.  It's good to have some alone time :) So Kathaumixw (Ka-thou-miew)was AMAZING!  Met some ververy cayute New Zealand boys... just ask me about them sometime... melt my heart... I have pictures! ;) Some slightly creepy Slovenian men, some slightly snobby Vancouver girls, some incredibly cool Ugandian (is that even a word?) people, some somewhat annoying Victoria children and THE most amazing Swedesh man ever!!! Fabulous Fred: I love him SO much.  (NO, not like that you creep!  he's like, 40! and has a family!  He's just so funny and really nice.)  He was the mass choir conducter and I GOT my picture taken with him! :) Overall, a completely a m a z i n g trip... we got 2nd in Folk, and the concert choir got 2nd in Children's Choir.  We also got the Elmer Isler Award for Best Performance of a Canadian Piece for the concert choir's Keewaden which was incredible!! Oh, choir tour is my very favorite time of year! and now I have 4 days to wallow in my depression before I go to CAMP! ...maybe I'll suntan... it's a beautiful day.

      Well, this is the last post for awhile!  I leave on Sunday for Powell River and it's gonna be SO fun.  SO excited.   Yesterday was Canada day, and I hope eeryone did something patriotic!  Had a very stressful choir rehearsal in the afternoon, then an OK concert. It wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't complete crap.  I'm still a little dissapointed with the choir for Uberlebensgross.  So afterwards we went to East Side Mario's, but they closed early so we went to Kayleigh's house.  Good times.  I had a horrible dream last night.  It was just so depressing.  :(  In happier news, I TALKED TO ASHLEIGH! in case anyone missed that comment.  She's having the time of her life, sends her love and she wants letters from everyone!   Asheligh Clark RAD 5815 State University Dr Room B-215 Long Beach CA    90815 USA So send her mail and she'll mail you back! (she has no email) Anyway, I'm going to check my laundry and start to pack... only 2 more sleeps! So in case I don't talk to everyone before I leave, goodbye and have an excellent week! :) xoxo

          Back in Saskatoon for a bit...  My summer has been so incredible! I've had such a great time that now as I'm thinking about it, I could wait a while for school to start. Only about 15 days.....ouch! But there's only 3 more days until Courtney gets back! Yay! That was one of the things that didn't work out this summer. The other thing is a lot different. But she'll be back super soon! It was really weird coming home and just hanging around my house. My new house is very cool, but it still doesn't feel like home. And then there's all of my friends, but I missed out on a lot and all I ever think about is the summer I had out of ToonTown. It all kind of worked itself out though. Wasksiu was so much fun! I don't think I've ever had that much fun with Russian leaders. Hahaha...good times. Not much else to say....Ciao bella! I

       Bah... so frustrated right now. I hate being patronized. Like, all old people (parents, grandparents, etc) Think that because you're young, you're stupid. And by stupid I mean, completely ignorant about all world issues, and incapable of  really  knowing how you feel or think.  But , despite all this, they still expect you to have already decided what you want to do with the rest of your life when you're 17 [I don't know how many times this summer I've been asked "So, what are you planning on doing after high school"... argh]. If that's not enough pressure, when and if you do decide, the school's much too expensive, and they "can't understand why you couldn't just go to a school closer to home instead." bah.    Just another happy little rant from your friend in Old People Land... luckily, my uncle's here now, and after that I'm off to the  youth  gathering! yay!    Last post for awhile so, bye for now and don't have too much fun without me!
