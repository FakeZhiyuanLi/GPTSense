						   Ok, I'm writing up a syllabus for my literature class which will start in about two weeks.  They've changed the edition of the anthology. Certainly, I am glad to see that Shakespeare still matters--indeed! However, I'm getting annoyed with the enduring myth which claims Shakespeare's sonnets were written in the early 1590s.   Do these editors who put together these anthologies even read the latest scholarship?  I don't care what tradition holds. So sometime around 1595, Frances Meres writes that Shakespeare's Sonnets, were "sugared," and that is supposed to tack a date down for us?  Katherine Duncan-Jones, in her latest edition of the sonnets, has suggested otherwise; maybe as early as 1603, to perhaps as late as 1608-9. I tend to agree.    Let us consider the notion of revision for once. Shakespeare may have written some sonnets around or before the time of Romeo and Juliet, early 1590s, 1594-95, but most of the sonnets are indeed problematic, and dark, and cynical just as the latter "problem" plays, which were written after the new millennia--1600. Surely before the publication, he had time to revise, being that the theaters had been closed and problems of plague in London.   I find absolutely nothing in these poems which suggest any notion of Meres' "sugared" sweetness, but scholarly tradition is adamant. Yet still, I think the common assumption is wrong. Let's just look at "sweetness" in the poems:            "For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,             Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds"              (94,13-14).   Clearly, the lines are anti-sweet; in fact, the speaker seems to suggest just the opposite. Weeds are preferred over a multitude of sweet smelling flowers.  The image is not nice: weeds are better than flowers.  Really, who would rather have weeds instead of an abundance of growing flowers?    And again, the couplet of Sonnet 118:             "But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,             Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you"              (118, 13-14).   The language and imagery here evoke the illness and bitterness of being in "Love."  This speaker is jaded.  He's not sweetly in love; he has been poisoned by her. And this whole, "sick of you." It lingers.  It's like he's saying, "I'm sick of you, and how you intoxicate me, enchant me, as if I'm taking a bad drug." It's like a chemotherapy experience to him.  And certainly last but not least, Sonnet 147, one of my favorites,                  "For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,          Who art as black as hell, as dark as night"           (147, 13-14).   Clearly the speaker, is disillusioned.  He once thought his beloved to be bright and angelic, but now he concludes that she is a diabolical imp. Essentially, he's telling her "you are a lover from hell!"  Is that a sweet term of endearment?  And certainly, I could go on and on.  There might be a few sonnets which evoke "pathos."  However, debatable, how does one explain the cynicism as revealed in these couplets?  And it is just not these three poems.  All over the sequence there is this underlying sentiment of despair, frustration, and exhaustion.    My point in all of this?  How can scholars be so rigid in suggesting that these poems are indicative of a less mature Shakespeare? By asserting that these poems were indeed written in the early 1590s, we dismiss the complexity, the cynicism, the sexual frustration, and the over all peculiarity of these poems.   I don't believe that the Shakespeare who wrote "Romeo and Juliet" could have written these poems.  This speaker/lover does not "Kiss by the book," as Juliet would say.  No, this speaker is misogynistic like Hamlet, and he's disillusioned like King Lear, and slightly jaded like Prospero! These poems have been revised, and were written by an older Shakespeare probably around 1603, and then published in 1609.    Somebody at the MLA please get the word out!

						   "Witchcraft," I don't know why I've developed this strange pre-occupation with Frank Sinatra.  I never listened to him while he was alive. But the day he died, I walked into the local coffee dive and suddenly, I discovered him. It was a tribute, and I was getting a posthumous revelation. H-- & V think I'm a little crazy!  But really, he's quite deep!   My whole life seems like that; I'm always catching things after the fact. I missed meeting the beautiful and great DWM's, Shakespeare and Milton. I missed the French revolution; I missed the roaring twenties. I even missed Che Guevara, and the sixties! I missed the sixties by being born. Hah!   I suppose I am a little nutty.  Nonetheless, My grades are done!  I was having anxiety dreams over all of those papers; I graded every last one. Now, I am feeling like I'm experiencing some sort of recoil, still slightly swirling, I don't know what to do with myself.       J spoke with me a lot this week.  I'm might have gone out with him, but I had been too distracted.  What I mean is-- that I don't think it is too healthy turning to J as I'm reeling from K.  So maybe this coming week, if the weather of my heart is a little more clear, dissipated, I'll go out with him.  I do like J, and I want to be fair to him.  I just don't want to look at him and think, "How come K isn't like you?"   But J has his own charisma. He let me know a bit about himself.  Both of his parents are teachers. He lived in Europe for several years, and he loves the French!  You know what else?  He's so, so, nice!  That right there made me drop my papers right in front of him, and start stumbling over my words... Ah yes, intelligent young woman suddenly turns stupid syndrome returns!    And that's just it; I never have had to play stupid around a guy, and I would never,  ever , lower myself!  When my smart girl friends play stupid to catch an idiot, it really irritates me. How demeaning! If the guy can't like you for your brain, then it is all a lie!  But when I am really  REALLY,  attracted to a guy, I do suddenly go brain dead!  It takes me a time to gather my wits about me...  In my mind, I'm still stuck on, "Oh my God, he's so cute, and so funny, and he's just so, so, so..."  Usually, I can tell if I'm moved by the guy in view just by my tone, my humor, and if I've dropped something!    Oh, I'll have to share some of the more momentous instances where I've dropped or spilled something in front of a possible lover. Sometimes, I am such a dork! I wonder would what Freud would think of my infatuation symptoms...   On Tuesday, I carefully pulled my grade reports out of my box.  I held them firmly in my hand.  I went through my box pulling other things, books and what not.  I was in the office area not really focused on anything.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow of a figure pass by the door. J! He stuck his head in, and then rushed in the room.  I looked at his beautiful blue eyes, and I suddenly felt so self conscious.  I kept fidgeting with my shirt and running my fingers through my hair.  And of course, I couldn't help, but smile and laugh! I'm not sure what we were talking about in those first few minutes.  I just remember him saying something about "Santa Cruz." I was thinking of that old Police song, "Do, Do, Do, Da, Da, Da, is all I want to say to you," just fuzz. Then to snap myself back, I said, "Of course, near John Steinbeck country..." I told him I grew up "behind the orange curtain" in Southern California.  At that moment, I thought I was really being my witty self again, but when I moved to the center of the room, my eyes grazed the floor.  The grade reports had landed so nicely, spread out like we were going to do a ground view. He picked up all the papers.  Didn't even say word.  As to how I loosened my grip? I don't know. Certainly, I had been intent on being smart and non-angular. I thought I had it together!!!    In the meantime, the secretary kept distracting him.  Apparently, she wasn't too pleased with our conversation. Jim rolled his eyes a bit. I looked at the time, and knew I had to go.  But J whispered, "Come with me to my office..."  So there I went!  Too cute!  I kept looking at him, and he kept looking at me.  He asked my age indirectly.  I told him, "I'm going to be depressed when I turn 35; maybe, I'll get drunk."  He hesitated for a moment and said in a soft sweet tone, "When I turned 35, I was in love!"  I felt that one;  I really felt that one!  Trying to disguise my warmth, my red face, I smiled and said, "Well, that's always so nice to be in love..."  He then gave a qualifier, "It's over now..."  He told me that he is 37!  Ah! Perfect!  Too cute!    I went on my way after he told me a bit more about his life,  that he managed a bar in a small town in the North West. I don't know why it is so important for him to tell me his story.  Ok, so now I'm really being dumb!  He likes me too. Good! Very good!   Ok, one more instance...  I had to call him the next day to ask about a grading issue. Again, We had a very nice conversation.  He said, "Are you Italian?"  I said, "I'm pretty much French..."  "Then," he explained in that sweet, soft tone, "Don't feel guilty for giving that student an F; The French have no conscience, remember?"  I had to laugh!  The guy makes me laugh too!  He went on to tell me that he knows a bunch of bad words in French.  I didn't bother volunteering my French potty mouth; I mean, when you grow up with a French father, you get accustomed to hearing "Putaine" this and "Sallop" that.  Yet still, he then said something really, really, cute, "Well, when we have a more personal moment together, I'll have tell you all the bad French words I know..."    Provocative indeed! So we ended it there. When I dropped off my grades on Wednesday, I didn't want to go by his office. I just thought I should give myself a bit of space; I want to be sure that I don't have any of K's prickles and stings left.   But I must say, I think I'm looking forward to this "personal moment"... Indeed, Jumbled Chaos

						   I know what my problem is! It's not like I'm in denial! I have long since accepted the fact that  I am too romantic  for my own good.  Troubling, and yet those closest to me have always said, "You're smart too, so that should shield you somewhat!"     It's not good to be in love with love at my age.  It hurts more, or maybe I'm lamenting my own foolish wound--again!  Let me make an appeal to my vague and silent audience here; I'm sorry if my posts are a bit melodramatic, un-novel. Really, I am an interesting person, yet I tend to forget that there are a plethora of individuals, who I'm sure have and are, experiencing the same loss of connection with the other gender/or the same gender,depending on preference, of course.    You see, I see what my problem is, but I am unable to move away from it.  I have tried NOT to be romantic, but it always gets jumbled.  Let me be more specific here: reading Pablo Neruda... The last line of "Everyday you play with the universe: I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees."  That line just moves me!  I could read the poem again and again, and it hits me!  WOW!    I remember in graduate school friends talking about what it would have been like to have made love to Keats, or Yeats.  I had to laugh because, in my head, I was thinking I'd always be second fiddle to Fanny Brawne, and Maud Gonne.  But Neruda, or Marlowe, or Shakespeare--Oh, incredible indeed!  "Come with me and be my love..."  Or, "Love's fire heats water, Water cools not Love," would be something I certainly would want to explore!   And it's not just the poetry.  It's my way of seeing things.  I love rain.  I love to go out in it, getting soaked, feeling and understanding what's around me. Or Taking a ride in the Jemez mountains, seeing the bright red earth amid the green of juniper against a perwinkinle sky, just makes me love.  It makes me feel in love, and want to love and be loved!  Or twilight around here; I can look up at a vivid sky, in this deep, deep blue, seeing one big star, and it speaks to me.  Pathetic romantic indeed!  And to waste a southwestern sunset on K!  Like he could understand that there never will be another one exactly, exactly, the same! He is a want-to-be romantic, and when a want-to-be, you tend to be pretentious, if not, artificial.    So much for imitations... Just now, I remember a conversation with the beautiful and brilliant EB.  We were walking around somewhere, probably to class, and out of the blue he said, "My problem, is that I'm too much of a romantic..."  When he said that, I looked at him,  REALLY LOOKED AT HIM, .  Again, it occurred to me that he could have been in my bedroom listening to me speak at night. I couldn't really define this uncanny substance of Plato's otherness between us, so I smiled and said, "It's a curse, isn't it?"  And then I looked up at the sky so I didn't have to look into his eyes and he said, "It's a beautiful sky, isn't it, " and I said, "Yes."   What can I say?  The man seemed to speak the language of my soul!  I suppose it is not good to remember so much about him; I need to give my next lover his own throne room of romantic intonations.  I have to put EB back in the museum...    Back to work, Jumbled Chaos

						   Grades are due on Weds. Ok, so right now I should be grading the pile of provocative research papers sitting on my right--hah! No comment!  I was getting sleepy. I'm also doing laundry.  I seem to be doing a lot of laundry the past few days.  But I suppose it is something I need to do: washing out my soul.  What is this Monday? I realize something about myself; I think I'd like a nice guy in my life.  I wanted not to think about K, so I read Edith Wharton's "The Buccaneers" in,like, two days.  Yes, it was her last novel, incomplete, and I could sense where the other writer completed it.  In the end, the language was too late twentieth century.  Kind of like when you read the last of Shakespeare's plays, you can tell where Fletcher moves in.  But anyway Back to Wharton,  Guy Thwarte, is our hero in this novel.  He is everything Ethan Frome, and Newland Archer are not.  It seems to me at least, that Wharton finally wanted to create a male character who is able to live outside convention. Thwarte has this wonderful ability to be a nonconformist.  He's so nice, sincere, kind, respectful, romantic as hell, and he gets it.  He understands that life is more than what we have--things, things, things! He's just content to live comprehending poetry and art and Love!   Ahhh!    Maybe, I shouldn't read novels like this when I am in such a romantically disillusioned state. I must say, today, I am in love with Guy Thwarte! He was having a conversation with our heroine, Annabell (Nan)St. James, and he talks about this notion of "beyondness."  In the strict setting of order and tradition where they find themselves, the lovers both share an understanding of the beauty of life.  They both know that it cannot be defined with money, or influence, but rather through art, culture, & a deep passion for humanity.    Oh, maybe my heart is just hurting a little!  I don't even feel jaded because I knew how K was made.  But, I just don't understand his meanness (is that a word?). It's something so foreign.  Why be sour?   I just need to be "got", I suppose.  I need to meet the right Guy. I'm not really lonely.  I know how that feels, and it is something I'm not ashamed of, but it would just be nice to be understood by the other gender.  One who says, "I get you, and your nutty jumbled chaos."   And while I'm making all these intimate disclosures, I may as well write it--I need to be Kissed.  K--didn't kiss too well!  I could really use a deep kiss by a sweet and brainy and dreamy guy who speaks my language!  And a long gaze too!  A very long gaze into my eyes--yes, indeed!  enough written, & I'm so glad nobody reads this gushing. (Nobody, right? uhm blush)  Jumbled Chaos

						   "Thinking, tangling, shadows" as it translates in English is one of my favorite Neruda poems.  I have been rather pensive today--not withdrawn, just thinking about my life.  I am so happy that my life is MY LIFE, and I am not at all envious of another life.  And I know that life can be complicated, but you know what, it is my deal here.    I just can't be cynical about life.  I love it!  Hah!  When I was talking with K   over dinner he kept saying, "Life is hard, and my students will come to understand that!"  Or something to that effect.  Thank God, I teach non traditional college students; yes, I leave my students to debate the cruelty, and relative ease of life in writing.  I only desire that they write something interesting, and when they come to my class, they leave all bad mojo out the door!   But K kept talking about suffering... Who doesn't suffer in life? Yes indeed as Shakespeare put in the mouth of Romeo: "He jests at scars that never felt a wound..." I can think about my sufferings; And it's really ok. Despite my bitter wounds, my life is so, so, good!  Hah!  I just can't share his reality of angst!  I should have said to him, "PLEASE, just get OFF the CROSS!"  The mutual and I conversed this morning... I just wanted to hear from a voice away what K thought of the work. Funny thing, K barely said a word to him.  K told the mutual,"it looks pretty good!"  And that was that!  You're damn right it was "pretty good!"  I suppose he does feel threatened by me--hah!  Or maybe that's just my vanity!!! Either way, I've yet to get a message from K! But I'm really not expecting it either!      Since I was having this EB relapse brought on by the amazing and gentle K,(notice my sarcasm?), I thought I'd put up some poems. Only the first poem is new; I wrote it about a month ago.  The others were written about three or so years ago...     ~For just one day,  Beneath a white sheet and a thick blanket, watching the sun uncover the Sandia Crest, Your strong man legs wrapped around my legs,  all quiet, all calm, hearing you breathe when  we sip fresh coffee, What I would give for just one day--  A day made for whispers and laughter where You would take my hands to your mouth, kiss my fingers, and utter, "I love you, I love you!"   If I had only a day, A day like that where you touch my eyes with your eyes, my splintered heart  finding its way into yours, A day made for soft words,  where you tell me of your day before, where I tell you of the night before, where we just remember like the scent of coffee, like day after a rainy day,  You speak, I hear I hear you whisper my name,  You whisper "history, Neruda, anarchy, or chickadee,"   It doesn't matter, To hear only your voice, my laugh, your laugh, to feel, to see, to know today your fingers roam through my curly hair, as my nails  gently brush your forearm, and in broad daylight you You toss the blanket over our heads, surely on such a day,  we would know  we would remember then, we both would know, know what it is to love again.      ~Deluge  I want to think of you as rain now, like July rain quenching Albuquerque, spilling on UNM or TV-I. I just want to think of you as rain, not as a shattered word in a broken glass, or a bitter glaze in rancid milk,  Love I want to hear you  like I listen to the rain, if just to hear you say, "Baseball, Putumayo, a Trotsky dream,   if the stars were French," if only you'd say my name if only you'd come to me,   Overdue kisses would flood infectious glances, Black clouds could gather our parched souls,   tears in dusty arroyos, the water would be here, with lightning, with healing, rushing, it all would appear, fresh mud in Tijeras and thickness of love.     ~What Love Is~  If you ask me what love is, I can only tell you of  waves that die at their peak, of a trail of sand lost to the  wind, and the wail  of seagulls. If you ask me If I know how to love,  perhaps I could answer,  with the grin of a flirt in denial, and with what happens in a cafeteria after a history class, or with hands that reach through you  like air, like water, Oh, I understand how love is: even the solitude of an oceanic sunset makes me weep, One cannot look into  the face of love  and easily forget.      These last two poems are together; they are loss & hope.     ~You say we all have a story to tell:  It snowed the day after Christmas in Albuquerque, but nobody nobody saw us making our way past the soaking luminarias with the dogs. There were no ears that heard us laughing as we waited in line for our coffee and Frontier roll.    No, there wasn't anyone to see us running the north golf course at  sunset, or unfolding your picnic of fresh fruits, a baguette,  and wine in Hidden Park No one saw our hungry kisses in the corridor of Nob Hill Center today, No one saw you greedily reach for my hand as we crossed Central into the book store, You did not read Neruda to me in Spanish, we did not talk about Peru, Colombia,  You will not tell me you love me today, or that I feel like home to you, But what does it matter? I do not live in New Mexico, And I have no story to tell, Perhaps I will not even hear you  say my name again, You are probably with someone else, kissing her as you couple her face with both of your hands, Your eyes look at her  Your eyes see only her                         ~If love is love, then tonight I have to believe, believe for instance,  that New Mexico watermelon sunsets  and the twilight of the back road to Taos will be ours.  Someone will hear  our Lab barking in the back of  of your vintage truck. Someone will shush us in the movie theater, There will be inside jokes, bike rides in Mexico, squabbling over the words  of Mario Vargas Llosa, and thoughts on Shakespeare's depths, There will be innocuous lies--  covering your loss of hair, my weight gain, your white bell bottoms, my cooking, There will be long nights  filled with swollen kisses-- And a morning will come  It must be so,  You will fold your arms  around my waist,  hide your face in my hair and say, "You smell just like a good cup of coffee!"

						   When I was in the fourth grade at Pleasant View Elementary, I had a teacher who must have understood my love for words and imagination.  It was a "PERRRFECCT A!", on "The Giant vacuum Cleaner," I mean REALLY GIANT, that took over our beach city.  Mr. Fletcher, a kindred soul, might have been even slightly amused that all our brave heroine had to do was simply pull the plug. With strength like Wonder Woman, she gave a yank to the cord, ending forever all that mass destruction of mass-sucking and mass-thrashing...  Indeed, everyone was happy in the end.  The sun set peaceably on Bolsa Chica Beach once more...   How I loved and understood the power of literature in the fourth grade!  No, I'm not sure that we read poetry at school then, but I know I was getting it from somewhere... Both my mother and father had an affinity for language, poetry, music, art, dancing! Nonetheless, in the fourth grade, it was my story, and it was a very good story, and it made me happy!   How fiction enchanted my little forth grade life, and fifth grade, and so on and so on... Fiction, make believe, imagined words and power, happy la-la land of fiction; I get it now in present 34 year old College instructor terms--fiction, like what didn't happen to me this week, but "What Should Have Happened:"  K--called me at 7:30 on Wednesday. His words were kind, and deep. He asks about my day, and then we settle on a place for dinner.   We sit in the patio of the restaurant going beyond, lost in Neruda,  lost in VanGogh, lost even in each other. Kisses and touches. Awkward pauses!  I go to his house, and he  hides my beige, hush puppy mules  under his bed...  A long awaited night begins, and when we wake up, he says, "Stay, stay, stay!"  Ah, yes, "What Should Have Happened" is just as ficticious as the Wonder Girl following the cord of the intrepid machine to save her city with a tug! But to the contrary, had the enchanting K story really happened, been de-fictionalized, it should have made me just absolutely happy and content!   But really, I'm not unhappy right now.  I love my life too much for that.  I'm just disappointed and disillusioned and slightly depressed. And literally, I've shared my grand illusion of K here, about what should have been.  Now for the truth to illustrate the grand disparity, the making of disillusionment.  I called him at 7:30, and he did not return my call. After waiting and hour or so, I called once more being that I had to get the info, for the mutual. I had no choice but to call.  We all have deadlines.  He was the usual cold, rude, cantankerous! Out of self preservation I said, "You throw barbs when I speak to you." He didn't say a thing. I said, "I do feel sorry for you."  or something to that effect... I was too tired. He was tired. He gave me the muted data/info, and then partially hung up... "I will talk to you later/good bye" Breathe--I couldn't  BREATHE!!! & then, The mutual talked to him the next day--Thursday... He got nothing out of it, so the mutual called me to try and figure.  The mutual explains, that for some reason, he feels, "I, JumbledChaos, am a threat to K, but K denies it..." I call K to straighten this mess out.  He's unpliable, and yet simultaneously shifting information from the night before. Yes, even paradoxical!  I maintain my professionalism; he jokes and says, "Since we have a special relationship," adding "just kidding..." I say clearly and realistically, "No, not especially, since you hung up on me last night..."  And then I'm feeling it, slightly agitated, so I say, "just leave me a message when you look at what the mutual gives you. I am more than curious since I did work with him on this for several days..." K says, "Ok..." I end the conversation gracefully.    Of course, I don't really expect a message from him.  He doesn't know how to show courtesy; he doesn't know how to care.  Caring would be for the K in the fiction piece. But then again, I didn't answer the phone yesterday, nor check the messages. I just didn't want to talk to anyone or to him; I wanted space, distance, air, silence, dust and sand, wind, anything to fill this gap between us--anything, but his voice, presence, being!       But V called this morning to say, "I just wanted to make sure you were out of bed, and that you hadn't gone and cut your hair, put on black, and sold all your clothes..."   Ah yes, dramatically so, but in that instance, it was EB! I had been made suddenly alive! Love, that fire storm between us, rolled the enormous boulder away, and EB called forth to my depths, and I like a feminine Lazarus, did rise, rise from that frigid, dusty and lonely sepulcher! Really, had any woman, in her right mind, experienced the amazing and beautiful EB for the two years, four months and twenty three days that I did, it would have been blasphemous not to mourn for one's life!   I never knew that Love could be like that--never! I swear I thought I had been reading WAY too much poetry, but then it did happen to me! Both V and H--remind me that it happened. And H--always remembers that he called me, "My chickadee..." How cute is that!!! And when I need a memory boost, H--tells about the time that we went to hear William Jefferson Clinton speak.  How, EB, was just dancing next to me; and how tight we were in the crowd...  I remember feeling EB's long arms, on my arms! Just now, I smell the coffee on his breath, and feel how his skin felt on my skin! Sticky, steamy, sweet.  I am so glad that I have the best two best friends on the entire planet! I'm so glad that they do remember EB, and all his good fruit in my life; because otherwise, I would be thinking that I had imagined it, more fiction, or that it was a grand hallucination, like that guy in the movie, "A Beautiful Mind!" Ok, so at least this way I know that EB, did, really happen to me, and that I'm not as neurotic and crazy as I feel.    And yet still that was so very long ago; I know as Neruda says, "We of that time are no longer the same..."  But looking back to EB always brings me great comfort--solace. I know I will love again, and I know how to love because I loved EB.  And stupid game players like K really mean nothing!  EB is the diamond and K is the foil!  Like in Hamlet where he's comparing his father (the former king) to his uncle (the new king): "This Hyperion to a Satyr." After a week of unwanted drama and evocative fiction, I understand, and feel that comparison today: EB, my great Hyperion, to this pathetic K, just a satyr--indeed!     Jumbled Chaos

						   What is wrong with me?  Now I seriously think I've lost it!  Why do I let him screw with me? My tactic for today was supposed to be evasive!  E-V-A-S-I-V-E!!     Screw it!  At the request, or rather insistence of our mutual piece of work, I called him. MR, was worried about some work that he had done for him; I had to call him!  I had no choice! Narcissistic, the guy is Narcissistic! So I try to be friendly; mind you, did he not just have dinner with me a week ago?  Did I just not talk to him LAST MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDS, and did he not just call me on Thursday?  And he can't remember my voice???  Ok, I was calling from the cell, and yes I have a freaking cold, but still... He didn't know who I was???? A complete blank???  He told me that our mutual cannot rely on me for help, and that it was nothing that I did wrong... I didn't think I had done anything wrong! I should have said, K--"You know, if you don't try to belittle me or insult me it will be a first!  In fact, every time I talk with you, you have something really crappy and demeaning to say!" Oh, But what the hell is his problem?   I shall not ascend to his greatness no doubt--the enlighend one indeed!  Ah, he really troubles me; he works me all up for nothing! I feel like crying over this complete ASSHOLE!  He's not even worth my tears!  Ok, back the phone coversation; So the mutual is stressing out in the back ground while I'm talking on the phone.  So I say, "I'll call you tomorrow... What time is good for you?"  He gives tons of explanations, and lets not forget how my phone call would interfere with his damn swimming... "I have to go swimming..." Does he want me to be proud of him because he goes swimming?  Like his stupid, long and lanky body could use the muscle building!    Nevertheless, I said, "7:30." He said, "I have my daughter.." What difference does that make?  We're not going to have phone sex!  I said "I don't want to leave a message..." He said, "7:30 that should work..."  Did he not suggest to me on weds of last week that I might call him for next week for this very reason?  And now it is a little game?  Jumbled Chaos indeed!  He's putting me on the rack!  I don't feel my age.  I feel like a sixth grader. And the worst part about it is that I know he doesn't care if I call him or not.  This man delights not in me! All of this TRAUMA he is putting me through, and it doesn't touch him one way or another...  How does one live his life like that?  Just absoultely numb to the vivacity around him? I don't get how he could be absoultely numb to this passionate, youthful, feminine, sexy, creation fluttering around him! Don't get me wrong, I'm not flaunting myself; I haven't sat on his lap.  I haven't been agressive.  But I have been simply me, and that energy I carry with me is undeniable.  I know my own strengths!   Usually, I am so noticed... Not that I look for it, but it is just always there.  He's working me up to no end.  I don't want to talk to him anymore!  But in this instance I had to for the sake of the mutual.  It was a mutual intervention if you will... I have to talk to him tomorrow, and I'm going to be BOTHERED all day about it!  But K--he's probably not even worrying either way...  I feel like telling him: "You know, I don't expect you to remember my voice... It doesn't sound like yours!"  No narcissus, it doesn't sound like yours!  He's conceited.   I'm not competing with him. I hate competition!  I'm not a game player. He's got a chip on his shoulder.  And maybe that's where I feel sorry for him.  "Pathos" he said at dinner.  I don't want people to feel "Pathos for me"... Well, I DO feel sorry for him!   I can't help it!  He's stuck on himself.  He's got a cold and rotten temperament.  He's selfish, and dark!  He doesn't know what he wants; he's on a search. And when your searching for what you dont know, you end up with what you don't want...   "Oh, I am Fortune's Fool!"  You know when EB, beautiful EB, exited my life, I told him, "I am never going to be this close to your lot Again."  I meant it! I passed my education, away from the like.  And with K, it is the same thing.  I am never, ever, going to be in contact with the like! You see, maybe I have this wierd twisted fetish for men like this?   And here I go, breaking everything down, analyzing it, for NOTHING!!! I am happy. I love my life.  I just don't speak his language. I said that to him too. "I don't speak your language," and he spoke to me in Thai, so I spoke back to him in French!    He has to compensate for his cantankerous personality through this illusion of good looks!  I saw his picture tonight; the mutual showed it to me.  I just looked at him, and I saw a very old man!  In the sense that e.e. cummings writes; "When men insist they are always right, then they are old."  I can't touch that; I can't break through that!       I don't want to either!  I just wish he wasn't getting to me; he's in me, in my gut, in my heart, and all over me like skin! Skin--Dammit!    Jumbled Chaos

						   The drama continues... J-called me twice yesterday!  He left one of the messages in French.  You see, he gets me!  But K!  K is just K!  Not a call, nor a word!  I have to address our mutual piece of work this afternoon.  I'm leaning towards evasion.    Why am I not attracted to J? & What is wrong with me? And K, who does he think he is?  Right--like he has it all going for him! He's temperamental...  Difficult, very difficult!  And arrogant as hell! Not to mention the fact that he's nine years older than me. H--said last week, "You know, You had a very good relationship with your father; I don't know why you are so attracted to older men."  We had a nice strong laugh about that. K is nothing like my father!  It's crazy.  I feel crazy; nutty!  He's making me absolutely crazy!  I should be grounded in my thoughts and feelings, but this guy is undoing me!  I should just say, "You know, perhaps we should talk about the correct form of past participles--in bed!"  Or "You know, maybe we can debate the problematics of Melville, and Moby Dick in bed."  or better yet, "I think we can put the practicality of appositional phrases better, beneath the sheets, in bed!"    Ah! I don't want to hear or to feel his twisted grammar theories anymore! I am on fire! I am not calling him!  Jumbled Chaos...

						   I talked to J-- today!  He is so nice and normal--not neurotic like K--!  He made me laugh.  He's very, very cute! And, he makes me feel like a brilliant, young woman. But dammit, he's NOT K!    Yes, Yes, I'm officially pining!  What the hell is my problem?  I get asked out nearly every day, and K--is immune to me.  How odd that feels to be immune to someone. I don't feel like ice, nor even cool water.  I feel like a piece of dry and brittle wood.  A long hard piece of wood that you would find in the back yard; maybe, an extra piece of fencing that you had forgotten about. But all the same it is there fading from that deep red fence color to sun blanched.  There are these little holes all about it, and on one side, it's still moist and wet from where it rests in the dirt.  I taste the moist earth in my mouth today!  I'm getting a cold too; maybe I'm love sick?  I don't know, but nonetheless, I just don't feel good today. I had to shut off the radio.  U-2, "All I want is you," was making me think, and feel WAY too much!  I'm not calling him!  Even if I have a problem with our little sweet situation, I'm not doing it.  We'll both have to figure it out for ourselves! I am a game to him, or a joke... And I don't want to be his amusement!  Since I didn't sleep too well last night, I sat up in the dark thinking about how quick K was to correct my speech!  What a polarity from EB!  I remembered how I suddenly got stupid around EB, and he was always so gracious.  He would get stupid too; we could barely remember what we were reading at the time.  LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA!!! How prophetic indeed!  But still, EB would have said, "Oh, don't worry about how you speak; I get you!"  He'd look into my eyes, and it was just clear and simple; My eyes against his eyes--a mirror!    But K!  I can never tell; it seems at times he looks at me as if he is hungry, or in search of something, and then more than often it is just a look like something you would smell in a circle k or seven eleven.  He looks at me causally as if one were deciding which pair of white socks to wear for the day...  And how I look at him?  I suppose it is a long simple glance that says, "If you only knew..." Or maybe one that says, "Touch me!"  Ok well, now I see I'm sounding incredibly ridiculous and pining away too!    I've got to go... Jumbled Chaos

						    I've wanted to do this for a while, but I didn't have time.  My last class was Tuesday and I'll have to get the grades in next week.  So for today, I have a little time to breathe.  I'm pissed-off! K--pisses me off! I haven't spoke with him since Thursday, and I'm not talking to him anymore!  I just don't get it; I'm baffled.  You would think being 34 years old, I would have figured out, or at least somewhat deciphered the male species, but still I am a rebel without a clue!     Maybe men are like copy machines. I know that I am copy machine inept; my students beg me to let someone else make the copies because they don't want to read upside down essays...  Ah, what's the problem?    K--said that he thought I might be a bit too "FLOWERY" with my students!  What the hell! So I'm just supposed to let my students throw what ever they want at me, and then pass them?  No!  It's not going to happen... But what does it matter? He's going to Thailand, or Tibet, or Laos for five weeks or so.  We went out to dinner on Wednesday night, and you wouldn't have thought we live in a desert. He is cold and arrogant and cruel and moody and selfish and so very ugly--well, maybe not that ugly... Yet for all that, I'm so attracted to him!  I can't believe it!  I never wanted to be one of those women attracted to a complete megalomaniac, but here I am.    I'm not calling him anymore.  I just so, so, so want him out of my system.  He's dangerous for my psyche! I am so not used to this; you know, I'm the one who is always doted upon.  He called me Thursday; I missed his call.  So I called him while I was driving home.  We talked about the tasks at hand, and then I told him, "I just want you to know I'm not attracted to you--I'm not. That's what I was trying to say to you last night after dinner." And yes, I am such a LIAR!  Hah!  But he just pissed me off! He didn't say anything. He didn't even try to kiss me after dinner.  He gave me this strange hug.  I was looking at his hands for a moment; I was wondering what they would feel like in my mouth, on my body...     I'm not supposed to be this emotional at 34.  My life is supposed to be relatively calm.  It is!  I am very happy with who I am.  I love my life.  I love my house. I love my family and my dear friends. I love all my shoes!  But K--is making me crazy!  He's going away for five weeks, he said.  But that sometime in the middle of July, he would call me, so I could come look at his garden.  I don't want to see his stupid garden!  I told V-- that "I would go and see it, and that I'd bring my new husband and new baby and we would all walk through the sunflowers together..."  V-- said,"Don't you think it is going to be a little HARD to get married and have a baby in five weeks?"  Indeed, but that's besides the point!  I told him, "I'm not calling you because everything is about control with you.  You are controllfull." Yes I have a masters degree in English, and I couldn't add the proper ending to the word! He caught it.  "You mean controlling," he said.  Yes, exactly, I suddenly get dumb when I'm talking with you.  But I do think that controlfull would be a great adjective! He does want to be the one who is full or consumed with control! It doesn't really matter to me anyway; I'm not talking to him anymore!   I wouldn't have cared if K--were going on vacation... I'm always happy to hear when people are going.  Hell, I'm happy when I go!  But just the way he told me... It was like he was saying, "I go travel to exotic places; I'm the only one..."  I said, "I might not be here when you get back. I'm going to Paris." I wasn't lying. I just don't have to brag that I go every year.   He doesn't like me.  That is the whole problem.  I've never had that happen to me before, and that's strange! I've never lacked for an interesting man in my life, but this one, just doesn't seem to like me! He doesn't like my hair, or my smile, or my body, or brain, and probably not even the sound of my voice!  Oh, my vanity!  Vanity and Vexation--indeed!   Back to the phone conversation on Thursday... I was telling him to "be safe" in his travels... We were talking for barely three or four minutes, and he said, "I have a cramp in my neck."  I can't believe how cold he is!  I just went into heart shock.  It's like he is intent on being shrewd and cruel to me. I have never known a guy who is so positively indifferent. It is like he's absolutely numb as to what he says to me. Yet, Wednesday, he was a little bothered by the fact that I said "I'm not calling you."  He insisted that I call before he left so we could discuss a situation... And when I do call, he tells me he's got a "Cramp in his neck..." ?? What the hell is my problem?    You know, it's not the cramp in his neck that bothers me just now... It's the stick! This, "I want you, but I don't want you... I like you, but I don't like you...,"Attitude!  I don't have time for his games!  I feel today that K--is such a waste of time!  He is a waste of time! Waste! I don't want to fix a man, or save one... I just can't go there!  That's what he said to me last Sunday, "Oh, your going to try to fix me..."  I said, "NO, I don't have time, and I don't want to fix anyone!"  Hello, I'm the jewel here!  I know this!  I love my life.  I love to laugh, and if he doesn't speak my language then screw it!    I suppose I just need to stop being attracted to these egotistical, semi-tortured artist types... I sometimes think I must have an invisible neon sign that reads: CREATIVE, POETIC, ARTISTIC MEGALOMANIAC WELCOME HERE!   Yesterday just thinking about K--and his b.s. made me cry a little.  And I don't even know why!  Really, he's nothing to cry over.  He certainly is no EB!  EB was my friend, my love, and you K are no EB!  Hah!  Well maybe that's it then.  Nobody not even the rain is as beautiful as EB!  His beautiful blue eyes, his lovely man-legs, his man-voice, his man hands! Oh my God--his very long, encompassing, lingering  glances! Now that, I could cry over--again, and again!  V kept saying, "Don't worry, K, is just a jerk! He doesn't get you like EB!  Remember EB, how he just got you!  He loved your hair, your smile, even your clothes... 'Violets, Violets,nice dress!, he said'" And then V and I talked about how glorious EB was and is!  V said, "I never even met EB, and I'm in love with him!" Indeed, "'Certainty like that comes only once in a lifetime...'" And the fact that he is married now, and lives so very far away is good thing for both of us!  I can't show up at his house naked, and he can't rock my world from this little corner!   But I suppose I've learned a good healthy lesson from lost love.  I'll know when the right Casanova comes along, he will be something like EB, but the timing will be right.   We will speak the same language, and instead of giving me strange hugs, we'll be discussing grammar and Shakespeare, and Moby Dick--maybe even, Gabriel Garcia Marquez under the covers at dawn...  We'll redeem the time! Yeah, I like that thought!  To hell with you K!  Jumbled Chaos

						   Love and war are the same thing, and stratagems and policy are as allowable in the one as in the other.  —Miguel  De Cervantes        Don Quixote  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; For well thou know’st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel...   —William Shakespeare   Sonnet 131    C. Guests .  To prevent emotional turbulence, it is best that  all visitors, welcomed and uninvited , obtain proper clearance. Whether a best friend, classmate, or sociology professor arrives at your lunch table, he or she must adhere to the following protocol:    1. Video tapes will not be permitted in or around the eating area.   Should your sociology professor appear rather excitedly, but uninvited, and produce a video called, “Mama Coca” about the cocaine trade in Colombia, and explain rather loudly while pulling up a chair next to you, “I got it just for you; we are going to watch it in class today,” you might want to shun eye contact with your host while taking the video in hand and expressing your deepest thanks.     If you happen to glance towards your host, do disregard the tempered look, and slight flush to his cheeks.   He hasn’t been feeling well lately, and when the two of you are alone once more he will explain rather pungently, “there’s probably something wrong with my body today...”   But your host’s illness is no cause for alarm, for soon he will be the perfect picture of health when he arrives at the very next luncheon with a former classmate.  After handing her a tray in the gourmet food line, he will turn to you while you are gathering your own tray and inquire like a true host, “So, is Dr. Sociology going to be joining us today?”  You will simply say, “I don’t know.  I didn’t invite him, but he keeps showing up.” To which he will reply: “Well, you are so popular...”     2. All clothing matching personality is prohibited.   When wearing a dress covered in violets, or stylish overalls with flowers printed about, do not discuss poetry, Latin America, or your astronomy class in the presence of your host or uninvited Sociology professor.  Even if the astronomy exam is making you feel somewhat apprehensive, refrain from verbally expressing your anxiety.    Your host may conclude that he would love to see you write an essay in astronomy such as, “If the stars were French...”  Your sociology professor will then concede, “Yeah, look at her clothes—Flower POWER!”  And once more your sociology professor who both you and your host call in secret, “Dr. Sociology,” will state at the top of his lungs, while waving his fist in the air “FLOWER POWER!”  At this point, you may find it somewhat comforting to look at your host’s eyes, for indeed, although he is the catalyst of the embarrassment, he does now seem to regret instigating the said banter.  He will project his, “Ok, so this guy is a little over the top” look, head turned slightly to the left, blue eyes open wide and bulging.       3.  Any direct reference to, or discussion of that word—-LOVE is inadmissible.    When your Sociology professor arrives at your table, once more uninvited, and pulls up a char next to you, proclaiming,“I’m in love,” you want to try and transfer the conversation to a more acceptable subject matter.   Should the conversation go awry; do explain gracefully that you are familiar with the notion of being in love, although you find it somewhat difficult at times.     If your sociology professor identifies the kind of love you are defining as, “A kind of selfish love, where the two of you are not thinking about consequences, but rather lost in your passions,” it is best to keep your head in an upright position.  Do remember to blink and to breathe normally when he continues: “Secret love is hard; any love where you can’t express your feelings is hard; you want the other person, but you just can’t tell them.” Also, you might want to consider implementing  the critical contingency plan: cease and desist from any gazing, glancing, or peeking at your host —-bleeding revelations can be fatal. And for the love of God, think twice before you utter, “Well, I think love like that sucks!”     4. Flirting with either your host or hostess is strictly prohibited . For security reasons,  a zero tolerance policy  is in effect for all flirtatious activity—except between the host and hostess, of course.  In order to prevent the following conversation which could occur the day after you’ve asked your uninvited sociology professor to tell you about his trip to Cuba via Mexico,  the ban on guest flirting will be strictly enforced :    Hostess: (enthusiastically) Hi, how are you today!  Host: You were nice to Dr. Sociology yesterday.    Hostess: Yes, I was.    Host: You’re cruel!   Hostess: No, I’m not. I’m nice; I’m always nice.    Host: No, you’re cruel.   Hostess: I’M NICE    Host: No you’re cruel!    Hostess: I am nice!    Host: Keep saying it; you’ll believe it!   Hostess: Why then, am I cruel?    Host: Because, you’re just a mean, mean, cruel person!   Hostess: Maybe I should sit by myself today; I feel like I’m bothering you...  Host: No, you’re not bothering me—yet!    It is important to note that even before you could sit down and properly greet your host, the first words out of his mouth seem indicative of a severe breech in security.  Likewise, you too might find yourself in a threatening scenario come the end of a luncheon:   Former classmate: I just love your little voice. Don’t you (to host) just love her little voice? (large smile)  Hostess: Thank you. I liked reading your short story.   Former classmate: (insincere) Why, thank you for letting the two of us sit with you for lunch.   Hostess: No problem.  Host: (to hostess) So, are you ready to scram?  Former classmate: (to host) So, what is the name of that Mexican liquor made from cactus? You really are so funny with all your great stories to tell...  Hostess: (ignoring former classmate) Yeah, but I’m a little slow at packing up today...  Former classmate: That’s ok, we’ll leave without you!    Therefore: Any guests attempting to flatter, lick/lock lips, gaze, flip hair, or invoke excessive,infectious cheer/beckon the undivided attention of either the host or hostess shall be immediately removed from the cafeteria premises.    For extra protection, you should eschew the following discussion which is likely to occur a day or two after you’ve eaten with the former classmate and your uninvited sociology professor:     Host: Well, where is Dr. Sociology today?   Hostess: I’m not sure; I have his class last. I was wondering about Ms. Former Classmate...   Have you seen her today?   Host:  I don’t know where she is.  Hostess: What time is it?  Host: I’m sure Dr. Sociology will show; he’s always right on time!   Finally, as an added security precaution and thereby avoiding any future allegation of “Death eyes,” all luncheons here after will be held at the back table of the secluded  STAFF ONLY  patio—-rain or shine: for all your lunching pleasure, the patio is conveniently and remotely located behind the retractable wall on the cafeteria’s west side.    Remember : The patio Luncheon begins at noon, and relax, don't be shy if you aren't exactly staff; after all, as your host has sugested,"it ought to keep you away from Dr. Sociology..."     Next--Etiquette: the art of flirting

						   “Love is not a fire to be shut up in a soul. Everything betrays us: voice, silence, eyes; half-covered fires burn all the brighter.” --Jean Racine  Orestes, in Andromache  “Speak low if you speak love.” --William Shakespeare Much Ado About Nothing    B. conversation.   Before ordering that perfect speech pattern for your next luncheon, it is helpful to note that communication styles may vary.  Your host for example, prefers two of the trendier patterns.     Pattern one : an opaque and semi-detached style. But still, it is very user friendly and durable enough for daily wear.  He relies on this mode of conversation for everyone—everyone except you, of course.     Pattern two : a more translucent, flowery style rich with sensuous adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Equipped with specialized volume, tone, and intimacy control, this pattern allows easy access to all comfort zones.   Pattern  two  can be especially effective when discussing close friends, and “poetry, music, beaches, and dancing.”        It is best to keep in mind that  pattern two  is just for you alone, and is subject to change. If your best friend has unintentionally snubbed the two of you for lunch, he might suggest in a very soft and slow voice, “We should tell her that I packed a picnic, a picnic of.......of fresh fruits...........a baguette.......a bottle of wine......and some cheese...”  Never mind the fact, that your best friend does not drink wine, nor does she have a strong preference for the very romantic foundations of French cuisine.  As usual take the necessary precautions: hands free of all sharp objects, and air passages clear.  Also, you might want to avoid his extended gaze after the word, “fruits,” should your lips begin to quiver. As an extra precaution, place one hand directly over your mouth and turn your face slightly to the left, focusing on the NO SMOKING sign located on the back wall.  Should your best friend arrive at the next luncheon, and he happens to tell her, “last week I planned a picnic,” with a smile meant for you, do not be alarmed when the traditional French food transforms into “Just goodies.”  Certainly, your best friend already knows what he said to you last week, but a true friend is curious if he will, in fact, reveal the contents of the picnic once more.  After pressing him with a suggestion of, “Chicken or??”  He will simply reply, “Just goodies. I wanted to bring goodies,” while looking at you intently. Under such circumstances, you may forget to wonder what happened to the fruit, cheese, wine and bread.    If your host finds himself in a tight situation, where he must make a rapid shift from  pattern two  back to  pattern one , he should be able to do so with relative ease. While the two of you are discussing your reading of Mario Vargas Llosa’s, “The Secret Life of Alejandro Mayta,” and you happen to reveal that you do not exactly care for the author’s style, but you find his vivid description of Peru’s beaches, and mountain towns quite stirring, you can expect your host's immediate proposal of “I’d like to teach a class like that, you know, on Latin American music, poetry, beaches and dancing,” to be equally arousing.  Be sure to smile, agree, and insist on being in the class so as to reach full dotage capacity.   But should your sociology professor abruptly interrupt the conversation as an uninvited guest, he will make the switch rather gracefully when he explains, “I was just telling her that I need to teach a class on Latin American culture...”  Again, while he is speaking, expect his eyes to remain solely on you and through you as if he is all too familiar with the very corridors of your soul.  However, be mindful that you are now in the presence of unsolicited company; try to remove all excess of red from your face, and do cool down with a sip of tea or diet Pepsi before turning to greet your guest. After all, you don’t want your sociology professor thinking “History is your favorite subject.”             And always remember: “Speak low if you speak love...”               Next--guests: guess who is coming to lunch?

						                   Duke. And what 's her history?             Vio. A blank, my lord. She never told her love,                 But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,                Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,                 And with a green and yellow melancholy                She sat like patience on a monument,                Smiling at grief. 			--William Shakespeare 			  Twelfth Night          "It was inevitable: The scent of bitter almonds always  reminded him of the fate of unrequited love."                     --Gabriel Garcia Marquez          	Love in the Time of Cholera   It happens with food.     Lesson One  At lunch: If a little hungry while waiting for your best friend to be through with her psychology class, and an all too familiar face finds you out side a dull college cafeteria, be sure to sit with him after he persuades you to "try the gourmet food line."  You will find his proposal on secluded patio dining quite intimate.  The first time will not be the last.     A. appetizer and drinks .   After you are seated, it is possible that you may have trouble with your hands; if you do not know where to place them as he tells you about a dream he had of Trotsky, try running your fingers through your hair.  Or, you may want to pick at the cherry tomato in your salad as he inquires about your weekend; when telling him, “so much can happen in two days,” to avoid all choking hazards, be sure to swallow the tomato bit before he replies, “So much can happen in twenty minutes.”     On  cold days , rely on your Styrofoam cup filled with hot constant comment tea should you find his lingering glance too intense.  You should be able to sustain any emotional fall out while shifting your eyes from his eyes to the white cup.  To avoid biting down at the cup’s edge, lick your lips, smile, and employ your infectious cheer.    On  warm days , it is best to chew the crushed ice in your tea when an awkward pause occurs.  Remember, this too shall pass; soon, he will put you at ease and on edge as he suggests more exotic, moist, places for vacation such as a stroll through the Amazon Jungle where serious allergic reactions to beautifully flowering plants are not uncommon, or maybe a little R& R in a café in Ecuador, smoking and drinking with friends.    And when the need arises for an extended vacation, such as a vow to be out of the country during a presidential inauguration, you will find his pitch for a trek through Mexico more than advantageous.  After all, cycle tours in Europe are all too common, and it is much better to be an "Anarchist at heart."  But if in the mood for places closer to home, he may recommend an airy walk on San Diego’s infamous Black’s beach, or because you have an affinity for flowers, you might prefer a little visit to the Anza Borrego desert, or Joshua Tree being that “the blossoms will be extremely beautiful from all of the rain.”    Or perhaps even better, a trip to New Orleans, since you are French, and would really enjoy the "Franco-Spanish influence," and the dark smoky bars awakened by the Jazz festival. Certainly, one of the many used bookstores might permit you to rescue a real keeper—an old copy of Neruda’s, “Twenty love songs and a song of despair.” Knowing that this poet is new to you, and you just love Neruda, he might even lend it to you; well, that is "if you can be nice," and if, he remembers to bring it.             Still if there is an absence of cash flow and time, you might give serious thought to his preference for “The back road to Taos.”  Indeed, the direct route is certainly less romantic and less interesting when traveling with the wrong person.    But if it is just a setting sun you are after, you don't have far to go. After expressing how you “love the view of the volcanoes on the west side of Albuquerque,” he will not hesitate to inform you of his frequent rides up to the volcanoes, where he enjoys "sitting there, seeing the pink, peach, and pale blue sky, while watching the sun go down."  When hearing his romantic sunset phrasing, avoid all fidgeting with clothes, and earrings.  Also, take caution: if holding a drink, you are prone to spill it on your salad which you have barely eaten, or on your dress.   Under no circumstances, get ahead of yourself; this is only the beginning.  For there are still many discourses on sunsets to come, and as he will assert again and again, “There’s nothing wrong with flirting...”    Tomorrow--Now You're Talking: Proper Lunch conversation.
