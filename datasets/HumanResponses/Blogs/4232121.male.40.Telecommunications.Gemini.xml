       I worked at Video Catalog Channel (VCC) from October of 1991-October of 1999. It was a Home Shopping Network which was based in Powell, Tennessee, but broadcast on Satellite TV, seen coast-to-coast, and in parts of Canada and Mexico. 24 Hours a day, 7 Days a Week.       Johnny Pirkle (A long time veteran of Knoxville Radio) was Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O) and President of Video Catalog Channel.      Video Catalog Channel effectively ceased all operations at the end of 1999, subsequently filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, in the Eastern Division of U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Knoxville, Tennessee.      While on the air, We sold mostly Collectible Items, such as Gemstones, Estate Jewelry, PocketWatches and Wrist Watches, Knives, Natural History items and more.       I was employed there as a  Production Assistant . I basically worked behind the scenes, sometimes operating the cameras, and sometimes working the Master Control booth (which included typing the graphics or item descriptions) on the screen, Changing camera shots on the switcher, and monitoring the Audio/Video levels of the programs.      Here are some photos from that time period for your enjoyment.....        YOURS TRULY! PEEKING FROM THE CONTROL ROOM WINDOW.

         Let's Begin at the beginning...      I was born Robert Eugene McMillan at the University Of Tennessee Hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee on June/13/1964. The last Son of Clarence (C.E.) Edgar McMillan, and Mary Louise (Anderson) McMillan.      Though I don't really recall, My Sister Jo-Ann tells me that my Dad was a Painter in his earlier years. He painted houses and other structures. He later would become Custodian at First Baptist Church of Fountain City. For as long as I can remember, my Mother was a Housewife. Just living at home. Cooking, Cleaning and caring for and taking care of my Dad and the rest of us, as any good Wife and Homemaker would.      I later, while living on Long Hollow Road, attended Green Hill Elementary (now Copper Ridge Elementary) School on Brushy Valley Road in Powell, Tennessee. The original school (Green Hill) was destroyed in a fire of unknown origin. Many of the flat-tops (as they we're called then) burned very easily and quickly since they we're constructed mostly of wooden materials. I faintly now remember standing there with my Dad, and the many others and watching awestruck as the firefighters from Rural Metro attempted to douse the smoldering remains of the buildings. The school was totally destroyed by the blaze. Later they would erect COPPER RIDGE ELEMENTARY on the very site where the old school had previously stood. Copper Ridge remains there to this day, along with the old sprawling oak tree where me and my classmates of yesteryear used to spend our carefree days at recess, just running, climbing and playing. It was here that I had my first childhood crush on a Sandy Blonde Curly haired girl by the name of Amy Higgins. It was also at Green Hill that we all donned blindfolds and participated in (for a lack of a better word) what I'll call the "touchy Feely" game. I won't say exactly what I wound up feeling of, but let me just put it this way...by the time I took the blind-fold off, my rather buxom 1st grade teacher Mrs. Frifth's face was as Red as a Grainger County mater. Here at Green Hill we spent such long and fruitful days. totally unaware of the troubles and obstacles that was to befall us, in the cruel and somber adult world, into which we we're all getting groomed to come face to face with, just a little further down the road.      After Elementary School came Middle School, which for me was to be Halls Middle School. Here we begun to acquire, polish and hone some of the skills and traits that we we're to begin carrying into our adult lives. To be honest, i had some troubles adjusting to the many twists and turns on my pathway of my life here.   I was failing. My grades were rotten, I rapidly became dis-interested in my school work. I was overweight. My self-esteem was practically non-existent. The other students for the most part made fun of the way I looked, dressed and acted. I had few friends, and never quite seemed to "fit in", and I was very depressed.       things came crashing down in a very hard way for me. So it was to be at this time it was decided by the powers that be, and by my parents, that possibly it would be best for all concerned, particularly me, if i we're to be placed into what was termed at the time an INTERVENTION UNIT. A special school where i would receive more individualized attention. A friendlier and kinder place that would cater more readily to my special needs. So the necessary papers were signed, and I began attending YOUNG INTERVENTION on Chapman Highway in extreme South Knoxville. This was formerly the old YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL.       From the moment I first arrived at Young, I realized that this would be totally different than anything I had ever experienced before. The building itself was antiquated, and in some places, almost falling apart. My class consisted of approximately 12-15 people. Much smaller than what I had been accustomed to at Halls. We had basically the same course of study, but on a smaller, and more individualized scale. I had several teachers at Young. Some of the names that immediately come to mind are...Larry Luster, Walt Cross, Debby &amp; Sherman Ames just to name a few. While at Young there begun a rather transitional turning point in my life. I found that the program really did work for me. If I needed help, I got it, and it was at this time that I really began to open up, and learn to adjust and to speak my feelings, as well as to listen to thoughts and opinions shared by others. Here at this school, you had the option to call what was termed as a 'Group Meeting' where all the students and teachers got together and formed a group, and openly discussed what the problem was, as well as attempting to come up with constructive ways in which to resolve the issues at hand. Aside from this, when we completed our daily studies, we would be allowed to go outside and either just sit around, or participate in what we called 4 square, which basically consisted of 2 or 4 people just batting a utility ball around in a lined off court. We also had a good time in the gymnasium playing Volleyball. I actually became quite good at it, and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was also at Young that I met my first real girlfriend. Her name was Sherry Hicks. She was a true Blonde. She was very sweet, and I was very much overwhelmed by her charm and beauty. Her smile could melt the coldest snow on a winter's day, and to be near her was just sooooooo delightful. Alas, she was in love with another, but I had my dreams, and the fondest wish of my heart at the time, was for us to someday be together. But it was not to be.      Young Intervention proved so helpful, that I eventually brought all my grades up to Straight A's! and it was also here that I took a Skills Assesment Test that showed me to be reading at a 10th grade level, even though I was only in the 6th grade at the time. after a time I was permitted to return to a regular school setting.      Today, as both time and progress marches on, a Kroger shopping center sits at the site where the old Young High School building used to occupy, there at the corner of Chapman Highway and Young High Pike. A shame that the old building is gone, but certainly not forgotten, as it will continue to live on in my memories.        Although Young had proved very helpful to me, it could in no way prepare me for what I was about to get into next...       My next stop in life...      Halls High School. I found that when I returned to regular school I had a hard time coping again. Perhaps I had gotten too used to life at Young. Again I had problems and again I started down the path that I had traveled previously. This time I decided to take what I thought was the easy way out and to just Drop Out. By this time I had somehow gotten through the 10th grade.       Also at this time my Sister Margaret who was living in Chicago, Illinois with her Husband and Family, had decided to buy a house here and move down to assist in taking care of my Mom and Dad, whom by this time was in a fastly declining state of health. She found and purchased a House at 8400 Sharp Road in Powell, Tennessee, with the provision that Me, Mom and Dad were to move in until she could get some unfinished business, and the preparations taken care of in Chicago, to move on down to Tennessee. It was also decided at the time that my Brother Kenneth would live with us too, as he was out of work at the time, and basically had nowhere else to go. So we all moved from Long Hollow into the house on Sharp Road. At the time I too was living at home and with no job. I was helping my parents out by running errands and doing pretty much what they needed me to do at the time.      While living there, I acquired both a used Vic-20 and a Commodore 64 computer from a garage sale. This was to be my humble entry into the field of computers. I played around with it quite a bit, wrote a few programs in Basic, and just fiddled around mostly. It was also about this time that a service called Q-Link came to town. I quickly climbed on the bandwagon. I also quickly ran up a huge bill that to this day remains unpaid. I also discovered about that time the wonderful world of what was called BBS'es. Electronic Bulletin Board Systems ran by System Operators (Sysops) that were just like you and me. Using a program called Greg Phounz (sic) Color 64 you could run your own board where you could Post messages. Download music and software of all kinds and chat. This was before the INTERNET became really popular like it is today of course.       I had a comprehensive list of BBS'es that I called on a regular basis. There was Smiley's Corner ran by SYSOP James Vankell, who ran it out of his home on Dutchtown Road in West Knoxville, also the Red Dragon Inn out of Lenoir City, Tennessee, as well as Clipper's Clip Joint ran by a City of Knoxville Policeman and his Wife Dee. I even managed to somehow obtain a copy of Color 64 and an extra Telephone Line and opened my pride and joy at the time...SUPERMONKEY'S BANANA FACTORY. Operating on a COMMODORE 64 computer, combined with both a Commodore 1541 and a 1581 Floppy Disc Drive. It was a hobby, and fun for a while.       Then one faithful day I happen to get hold of a telephone number for a new BBS called DEATH ROW BBS, ran by the Sysop (The Master Of Death) David Baker, out of his home on Bethel Road in Clinton, Tennessee. As luck would have it, David had already previously visited the BANANA FACTORY and saw some of my Scrolling Macros that proudly announced..."Supermonkey Needs A Woman" and things like that. So he was well aware of the fact that i was looking. One day David was home and happen to notice that I had logged onto his board. He hit ***CHAT MODE *** on his computer, and preceeded to chat with me. He said he had someone he wanted me to meet. His Sister Dana, who was single and at the time did not have a boyfriend. So I chatted with Dana for a while and we set up a time and a place to meet. It was agreed we would meet at Kay's Ice Cream at Black Oak Plaza in Halls.       I did go and meet with Dana. We chatted for about 30 minutes or so, and we could see that we really did not have that much in common. I was getting ready to leave, but she suggested I stick around as David was on his way there to see Dana. Well, when David arrived in his Gray Mustang, he also had along Dana's Sister Denise. At this point i'll just say that the rest is history. We hit it off, right away. We dated, we fell in love, I got a job, we got married. We got divorced 10 years later.       I was very depressed. It really hit me hard. I spent many lonely nights just crying myself to sleep at night. Praying to God for the strength just to get through another day alone.       Not long after me and Denise had decided to separate I tried the computer and finding several dating sites. After several Months, One day I discovered Matchdoctor.com. This seemed to be a very good site. There seemed to be several women in my area who was looking for someone. Then I read the profile of AngelsInHeaven and discovered Sandra Wynn. Before long we had exchanged phone numbers, and was chatting on the phone well into the night. Turns out that she knew firsthand my pain and suffering because she had gone through it all herself. Like me, someone had broken her heart, and ripped her world apart. She was no stranger to the tears and heartache.       We talked, we set up a Date. Our first encounter was to be at her parent's home. I still recall the date. We went bowling at Fountain Lanes in Fountain City. She was just about the lousiest bowler I have ever seen. Ha! Ha! but i gave her encouragement and hugs. We also took a window shopping tour of Knoxville Center (East Towne Mall), and got a bite to eat and went home and watched our first movie snuggling on the couch together "Titanic".       In the weeks and months to come there would be more dates, and nights and weekends spent together. Finally we got tired of driving to each other's house and said ah heck, let's just get married! hehehehehehe. No, that's NOT how it happened. Actually Sandy got sick after eating at Mandarin House in Knoxville and i had to rush her to the hospital. While she was there i stayed with her every second of the time and couldn't bring myself to leave. It was then that we realized that we just couldn't spend another night apart, so as they say...the rest is history.      We got hitched at her Parent's house in South Clinton on September/20th/2003 and Honeymooned in Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg. and as for the rest....      WE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER!
