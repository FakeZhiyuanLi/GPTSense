      If ever you wonder, if you touch my soul, yes you do Since I met you we're not the same, you bring life to everuthing i do just the way you say hello, with one touch, i can't let go never thought i'd fall in love with you..  *Because of you, my life has changed, thank you for the love and the joy you bring because of you, i'd feel no shame i'll tell the world, it's because of you  sometimes i get lonely, but all i gotta do is think of you you've captured something inside of me, you made all my dreams come true it's not enough that you love me for me you reached inside and touched me internally "i love you" best explains how i feel for you  (repeat *)  bridge:  The magic in your eyes, true love i can't deny when you hold me, i just lose control i want yoy to know, that i'm never letting go you mean so much to me, i want the world to see, it's because of you..  (repeat *)

      No ane ever saw me like you do All the things that I could add up to I never knew just what a smile was worth But your eyes, say everything, without a single word  *Coz there's something in the way you look at me It's as if my heart knows, you're the missing piece You make me believe that there's nothing in this world I can be I never know what you see Coz there's something in the way you look at me  If I could freeze a moment in my life It would be the second that you've touched your lips to mine I'd like to stop the clock make time stand still Coz baby this is just the way, i always wanna feel  (repeat *)  bridge: i don't know. how or why, i feel different in your eyes all i know is it happens everytime...  (repeat *)
