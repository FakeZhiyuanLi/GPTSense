      I'm feeling lonely and useless. I mean, what's the point of having someone you really love when that person doesn't need you. Clapping with only one side of the hand won't work. Haiz. What have i done that God made my life this way. Maybe i deserve it maybe i don't. I really love her and she's the only one in my mind now and forever. Hope she feels the same way too.

      Hope dangles on a string.Like slow spinning redemption.Winding in and winding out.The shine ahead has caught my eye.And roped me in so mesmerizing.It's so hypnotizing.I am captivated.I am Vindicated.I am selfish.I am wrong.I am right.I swear I'm right.Swear I knew it all along.And I am flawed.But I am cleaning up so well.I am seeing in me now.The things you swore you saw yourself.So clear.Like the diamond in your ring.Cut to mirror your intention.Oversized and overwhelmed.The shine of which has caught my eye.And rendered me so.Isolated so.Motivated I am.Certain now that I amVindicated.I am selfish.I am wrong.I am right.I swear I'm right.Swear I knew it all along.And I am flawed.But I am cleaning up so well.  I am seeing in me now.The things you swore you saw yourself.So tired of the corners of your lips.Part them and feel my finger tips.Trace the moment for forever.Defense is paper thin.Just one touch and I'd be in.Too deep now to ever swim.Against the current.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.So let me slip against the current.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.Vindicated.I am selfish.I am wrong.I am right.I swear I'm right.Swear I knew it all along.And I am flawed.But I am cleaning up so well.I am seeing in me now.The things you swore you saw yourself.My hope dangles on a string.Like slow spinning redemption

      Have you ever feel that you're useless in every way? I'm feeling that right now. Everything i do did not turn right. I'm really good for nothing. Why is this happening to me? Why can't i be some ordinary guy who is smart and good at something? I really wish that this will end soon. I understand that there's ups and downs in life. And i believe that i've had enough of downs and i want my ups now.

      Dammit man. Today i'll be having school until 5.15 in the afternoon. After that i'll have to travel all the way to Singapore Polytechnic to fetch my girl. Haiz. Tired man. But nevermind. She means everything to me and i'll even swim in the sea of fires to get to her. Cheers!
