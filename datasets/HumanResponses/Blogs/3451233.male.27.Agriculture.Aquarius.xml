All I can say is this................KHARMA.....................................it's nature's way of slapping your enemies without you lifting that middle finger.

      Oh well.......just got home from a dinner with two close friends in this newly opened restaurant.  It was ok but then again,never go eat in a newly opened restaurant.  The waiters are eager beavers, the food always sucks, no people around................EMPTY.............and same goes to your wallet. But amidst all that empirical bruhahas...........I had fun.. As I went home.........car started stalling.  Hay ...........I should never had taken that car!  So then the story continues..........as I opened the door to my room, I sensed that my sister is in distress.  So I sensed first without me speaking a word.  Then I started hearing her talking skirmish with my grandmother.  Guess what was the topic?  It's about my dad.  NOW WONDER!   I nearly grabbed my light saber and slashed the life out of the telephone.  I cannot bear to see my siblings stressed.  Damn, my grandmother is senile.......point blank.  BUT WE DO LOVE HER BY THE WAY.....................   OH WELL......time to de-stress myself.  Have a gig at Bar 21 tonight with my band at 10:30.  Got 30 minutes to de-stress myself.  Till then

      Went to the vet today.  Had to get my dog a booster shot and only to find out that I have unpaid bills.  Damn.  What are these vets thinking? He lost one of my dogs in his own freakin clinic once and never even offered anything.  Hell !!1 I'll be preparing myself for tonight's gig at Bar 21.  New songs..........new songs...........new songs...........old clothes.........old outfit..................i look like a sack.....................

      finally.........got this shit moving.  Thanks to Jo, my very good friend, who scratches me and whips me to grease the wheels of movement to finally write my first entry Well..........here i am.......feeling like a pathetic loser.  No money, no love life.............NO LIFE AT ALL.  A lot of people have told me once or twice after a sip of java that they envy my work, achievements and all those crap...................... READ MY LIPS.........BULL SHIT! Anyway, this is so great.  I'll be writing down the things that my normal ID would not even dare say.  CONSTANT MIND DIARRHEA!  YIPPEE!!!!!!! LET IT RIP!
