      "I don't care what the mayor says!"  "Dick, you can't go through with this.  You're not going to survive."  "Oh ye of little faith.  Have I ever let you down, Mel?"  Mel just stood there for a moment, thinking.  "I guess you haven't.  Okay, you have my blessing."  "Thank you, buddy.  Don't worry about a thing.  I'll be just fine."  "What are you going to do about the mayor?  I'm sure she'll be sending the police.  Knowing her, she probably called the National Guard by now."  "Well, I was expecting some resistance.  I have that little surprise for anybody foolish enough to try and stop me."  Mel gasped in horror.  "You can't mean..."  "Oh, yes," Dick grinned.  "That's exactly what I mean."  "No, Dick!  No!  That's horrible!  I can't let you do it!"  "I don't think you have a choice in the matter, Mel."  Then Dick did the horrible act to Mel.  "How...could...you…," Mel wailed.  "I thought you loved me!"  "This has nothing to do with love, dammit!  It's just -"  Suddenly, from out of nowhere, helicopters and S.W.A.T. vehicles surrounded the lovers.  "I'm sorry, Mel.  But I regret nothing," Dick said, with a tear in his eyes.  "It's okay Dick.  You were only doing what you thought was right.  I forgive you.  And I love you."  "It's not over yet, Mel," Dick said as he was preparing to do the horrible, awful thing to the approaching armies.  However, before Dick had a chance to do it, Mel, with his last ounce of strength, stopped Dick before he completed the vicious act.  "I'm sorry, Dick.  I just couldn't let you do it to all these innocent people.  They all have families as well.  They all have lovers, too."  Mel smiled up at Dick with intense love in his eyes.  "Your faith in humanity is inspiring.  From now on I will do everything I can to better the human race."  Nevertheless, Dick would never accomplish this feat.  He was arrested and sentenced to jail for six years.  He got out in five, and instead of helping humanity, he went back to his old, evil way of life.  During Dick’s stay in prison, Mel divorced him and remarried.  The new couple lived happily ever after.  Until Dick killed them.  The End.

      I just had a vision that I was elected the President of the United States in a landslide. It was the most amazing thing you could ever imagine. A slide of a large mass of dirt and rock down a mountain carried me to my doom the exact second Tom Brokaw announced the results. Then my good friend, and former Vice Presidential nominee, Herbert R. S. Dillon, was run off the road by a lunatic driver a few moments before government officials held the run-off election (since the previous election did not produce a winner.)  Herbert survived, won the popular vote, but still lost because of that godforsaken electoral college crap. He did carry Florida though.

      Triumph the Insult Comic Dog made fun of me the other day. I thought I could handle it, but he was just too cruel. I cried and cried, but he wouldn't stop. He kept talking about pooping on me.  After Triumph had his way with me I ate a whole can of French cut green beans. They tasted awful, so I called the 1-800 number listed on the label.  "Hello, customer service," a saucy young man said on the other end of the phone.  "Yeah, hey, what's up? Um, yeah, well...You see my green beans that I just ate? They kind of tasted bad."  "I'm very sorry to hear that," he said.  He really did sound sincere.  "Our green bean company prides itself on only shipping only the best beans in the world.  I would be happy to send you a complimentary can.  We apologize for any inconvenience."  "Oh, okay.  Thanks man.  But I don't think I really want that. Your green beans kinda suck."  "I'm sure if you just give our brand beans another chance you too will become one of the millions of satisfied customers served this ye- "  "You guys make anything 'sides green beans?" I wondered.  "Corn."  "Hmm, could you send me some of 'dat? I like corn."  "It's on the way. Thank you for calling customer service, and have a nice day!"  The corn arrived almost instantaneously. They actually shipped it next-day air. As happy as I was to receive the package, there was one small problem. So I called the 800 number again.  But it was after 5 P.M. Pacific time, and they were closed. I had to wait through the whole weekend before I could talk to them.  On Monday, I made contact.  "Welcome to customer service!"  "You mother $%&amp;#ing ass-lickers! I'ma gonna kill you! I hate canned corn, you bitches! I thought you were gonna send me corn on da cob! Not 'dis bull crap s#*%! I hate you! I hate you! I hope your company dies! You can't do this crap to people. It's just not right!" I began to cry.  "Sir, this is a professional call. If you continue to use that language I will disconnect."  And so I was disconnected and apparently my telephone number was blocked from calling their offices ever again. I took the piece-of-crap can of corn to a homeless shelter and vowed never to eat vegetables again.

      I started to read a book tonight. It was about all sorts of interesting things.  Then I fell asleep.  I dreamt that I was living inside of a light-bulb. Judging from the brightness it must have been a 100-watter. It was quite cozy, enough room for my six children to each have their own bedrooms. The only problem was that the light-bulb was constantly left on. The children were all very tired but they could not rest because the light was shining so brightly in their faces. We all huddled around as a family and prayed that the endless brightness would cease so we could all rest comfortably. Thankfully, our prayers were answered.  Pity that we all died in the end.

      Somebody said something very interesting to me today. "Thank you for shopping at Wal-Mart!" they told me after I finished buying some hygiene products. They were feminine hygiene products, but not the ones you may be thinking of.  "You're very welcome," I said. "I'm glad it makes you so happy."  "You have no idea," I was told.  "I sure don't," I informed the salesperson. Then I hopped in my 3-seater airplane and flew off to go visit with Morgan Freeman. He was quite surprised. That just happened to be our first meeting. He agreed with me that ESPN NFL Football is better than Madden this year. There really is no contest.  I waived goodbye and off I was to go kill some coyotes. I searched for three hours and unfortunately didn't find any. Eventually my plane ran out of gas and crashed into the Indian Ocean.  Sucks to be me.

      I have this really cool remote control. You should see it sometime. Mayhaps I'll post a picture of it one day. I also have several awesome gold cylinders on my desk. They're about the size of a soda can. In fact, they are soda cans. Empty Caffeine Free Diet Coke cans to be exact. Now don't get all excited on me, they're not mine. My wife drinks that crap. Wolf Blitzer probably drinks it too. Princess Peach and Daisy as well, no doubt.  Tom Brady is going to get his 3rd ring and SuperBowl MVP this year. He-Man told me so. He came up to me with his battle-axe and crossbow and explained everything. "Pats are lookin' good this year again. You know they've won 15 games in a row, and there's no reason to doubt them now." Thanks He-Man. Now you jynxed the whole damned season. Screw you!  Actually, He-Man is pretty cool. He is the Master of the Universe after all. And this brings me quite nicely to my next point: Chester Cheetah, Master of the Cheetos. Believe it or not I once named my tennis racquet after the famed snack food icon. But that was a long, long time ago. I haven't stepped foot on a tennis court in a good 5 years. Maybe 4. I came to the conclusion that tennis sucks. Hopefully network TV will come to the same (I'm looking your way, NBC.)  I just escaped from Monkey Island. You can imagine how that went. 9694.

      This is the Word according to a crappy dictionary I picked up:    Noun: logagraphia    A loss of the ability to write or to express thoughts in writing because of a brain lesion       Then I cleverly added the B.   Pure genius.
