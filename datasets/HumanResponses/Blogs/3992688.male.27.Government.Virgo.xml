       A fellow blog has put up an excellent  urlLink analysis  of CNN's anti-Kerry bias during the Democratic National Convention. Newsweek is also reporting a "baby bounce" for John Kerry in a new  urlLink poll . It has Kerry at 49 and Bush at 42, a gain of four points from the last Newsweek poll. The only problem is, it's a bad poll! The poll was averaged from polling on two days, one of which was Thursday. Kerry's speech was Thursday night, meaning an accurate poll meant to measure a bounce couldn't be done accurately until Friday. Coincidentally, the polling done on  urlLink Friday  showed a much greater lead, with Kerry at 50 to Bush's 40 - a lead of 10-points! Though Newsweek does mention the fact that the results might be skewed because of this in the article, that apparently wasn't enough to stop them from publishing a poll, which will cited in articles and the media without the context the article provided. The truth is, no accurate polling of Kerry's convention bounce will be available until next week, with polls covering days from Friday, and not before.    UPDATE: Paul Krugman takes on CNN's bias too in his   urlLink  latest Op/Ed   .

       I know, I know. The race is tight. The networks says Kerry and Bush are neck-and-neck. Most urlLink  national polls  show Kerry leading, but it's in the margin of error, therefore it's labeled a "statistical tie." However, when one uses state polls to determine the standing in the race (as the electoral collage is what really determines who wins), you see Kerry has a  urlLink bigger lead . Of course, many of those state polls are within the margin of error too in the battleground states and some will change over the next three months, though the  urlLink trend  favors Kerry. Nontheless, the meme from most news organizations is that is a tight race. But is it really? We won't know the bounce from Kerry's convention speech until sometime next week, but John Zogby has very interesting early  urlLink analysis .   Basically, Kerry's leading all Democratic base constituencies, including the Catholic vote and even leads slightly in the South, while Bush's base is eroding. But what is even more interesting is if turnout is as high as many think it might be, this election might not be as close as people think:      "Mr. Kerry is showing a 2-to-1 lead (50% to 25%) amongst voters who didn’t vote in 2000, while winning three-quarters (75%) of Ralph Nader’s voters and stealing twice as many (8% to 4%) of Mr. Bush voters in 2000 than Bush is stealing of Gore voters in 2000."      Now here inlies the problem with the current polling. Most polls take into account what they refer to as "likely voters." Though any thinking person might assume "likely voters" means they asked who they were polling if they were likely to vote. Not so. "Likely voters" means those who voted in the last election. We all know many thought the 2000 election was a farce and stayed home. We all also know that's not gonna be the case this time. 9/11 happened since then. Bush happened! Turnout is gonna be high, and it will favor us. I will grant you the electorate is polarized, I see that everyday, but Kerry could be very possibly win over 50% of votes (which someone hasn't done in awhile). So let's start repeating our own meme (the right and the media do it all the time, so it's only fair):  Kerry, in a landslide .

       Last night, John Kerry gave his  urlLink acceptance speech  for the Democratic nomination for President.&nbsp; We here all believed it was a great speech, and that Kerry did what he needed to do to sell himself to undecideds. From the few I saw on the media channels last night, it looks to be so. We will see in the coming days what kind of bounce John Kerry gets from his speech and how long it lasts. For right now, I want to discuss the speech itself. I was certainly, like many others, impressed with the strength of the speech, that he didn't shy away from Democratic values like so many others,&nbsp;and that Kerry seemed like a new man. He seemed more comfortable, more personable, more presidential. He seemed  ready . Last night made me truly proud this guy is the Democratic nominee and I will proud to call him President.    &nbsp;  I have collected some highlights from the speech below:    &nbsp;  "I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty!"    &nbsp;  "There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better."    &nbsp;  "Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities and I do because some issues just aren't all that simple. Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so."    &nbsp;  "As President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to. "    &nbsp;  "We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism."    &nbsp;  "That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people."    &nbsp;  "I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi royal family. "    &nbsp;  "Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States."    &nbsp;  "Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America red, white, and blue."    &nbsp;  "I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. "

      Today in his  urlLink column  in the New York Times, Paul Krugman mentions this:   "P.P.S.: Three weeks ago, The New Republic reported that the Bush administration was pressuring Pakistan to announce a major terrorist capture during the Democratic convention. Hours before Mr. Kerry's acceptance speech, Pakistan announced, several days after the fact, that it had apprehended an important Al Qaeda operative. "    &nbsp; The Al Qaeda operative they're referring to is Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who has been wanted in connection with the embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya. He was captured last Sunday, but the Pakistani goverment waited until yesterday to  urlLink publicly announce &nbsp;his capture.    &nbsp; I didn't see this article in The New Republic when it came out, so I read it for myself. In it the authors discuss the pressure being put on Pakistan to produce "HVTs" in time for the November elections. I've quoted the passage Krugman is referring to specifically below:    "A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis "have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must." What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement: "The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington." Says McCormack: "I'm aware of no such comment." But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that "it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July"--the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston. "    &nbsp; Of course the Bush administration denies putting any such pressure to produce high-ranking members of Al Queda with the elections in mind, but the timing of Pakistan's latest announcement seems a little fishy to me too. The point of delaying the announcement of his capture until yesterday would be to draw some attention away from Kerry, and help to focus some the attention on the Bush administration and their success in the war on terror. However, given the fact that Ghailani seemed to be mostly unknown by the American public before his capture, the advantage in announcing his capture to coincide with the DNC convention is slight at best. But it does give credence to the belief that there is no issue, not even ones of national security, that the Bush administration won't play politics with.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      The Texas Democratic Party is trying to raise 15,000 over the next four days. If we win a net gain of just 2 seats in the next elections in the Texas House, we would be the majority again. This would be a great way to tell Tom Delay, Rick Perry, and Tom Craddick (who would likewise be out of a job)&nbsp;that's what we think of their efforts to redistrict out our US Reps, and that they can kiss our Texan asses.    urlLink http://www.txdemocrats.org/contribute/15k14days/index.php

      As I mentioned in my earlier post on this topic, the run-up to any war in Iran begins first with the coordinated effort by various hawkish and conservative pundits to convince the American people of the "rightness" of any preemptive invasion. This first requires an airing out of the idea of the invasion, first in conservative media sources like  urlLink The Weekly Standard  or  urlLink The Washington Times . The next step is to take the op-ed columns to the mainstream media, like  urlLink The Washington Post , where they can try to reach a greater number of Americans and persuade them of the threat of a nuclear Iran. This is exactly what happened with Iraq, and the hawks are trying it again Iran. So I'm going to keep track of the "chatter" out there in the conservative media, with a weekly post I'll call "Iran Invasion Watch." Each week I'll post links to new articles, op-ed pieces and commentary that I see in the conservative media, advocating the invasion or Iran, or building up the potential threat of Iran to pave the way for talk of an invasion.  And of course we'll all keep an eye on what the administration has to say about Iran, to get a sense of whether what the pundits say is gaining traction.  Today we have this, from  urlLink American Daily . There's no specific recommendation for invasion, but rather an effort to set the mood by focusing on the threat of  urlLink Iranian-sponsored terrorism.     PS. Occasionally I'll post the left's response to Iran invasion talk. Today we have  urlLink this , from Znet.

        The US-led coalition's failure to restore security has turned Iraq into a  urlLink battleground  for the likes of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, a parliamentary committee said.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a major report on the war on terrorism released Thursday, the House of Commons foreign affairs committee said the lack of law and order had created a "vacuum" for criminals and militias, with "appalling consequences" for the Iraqi people.&nbsp; It added that Iraq's own police and armed forces are still "a long way from being able to maintain security," and warned that ongoing violence could mar elections planned for early next year.     Well, this report agrees with what we already know - not only did the Iraq war take the focus off Al Qaeda and the war on terrorism, it probably made it worse! Now we are fighting an unwinnable war with dire consequences.     Thankfully, America has the option of correcting this course. Tonight, John Kerry will  urlLink accept  the Democratic Party's&nbsp;nomination for president. The choice is simple, and the action easy. All you have to do is cast your vote this November.

      Fred Kaplan explores this issue of an arms race with North Korea in this  urlLink excellent article  at slate.com.    "The parallel between then and now is not precise. North Korea does not have the resources that the Soviet Union had at the height of the Cold War. But with the deployment of the new missile-defense system, the United States has entered into an arms race with the North Koreans—an arms race we are likely to lose—and nobody in the White House or the Congress seems even to be aware of it."     &nbsp;  For nearly two years now critics of the Bush administration's policy towards North Korea have tried in vain to point out that of the three members of the "Axis of Evil", Iraq, Iran and North Korea, North Korea by far presents the most immediate threat to the United States in the form of a revamped nuclear weapons program. It's no secret that North Korea would like the ability to gain some leverage over it's Asian neighbors with it's nuclear weapons(and perhaps eventually the&nbsp;ability to  urlLink threaten the United States.)&nbsp; It's also speculated that North Korea may seek to sell some of it's nuclear weapons technology to other nations that we might not like to see armed with these weapons. Unfortunately our administration seems to think that installing an ABM system in Alaska while avoiding direct negotiations with N. Korea is the best policy for dealing with this threat.   The hawks of course are silent on the issue of nuclear weapons in North Korea. For one it doesn't fit into their grand schemes of remaking the Middle East, and second North Korea already  has  nuclear weapons, and any military effort to remove them would not nearly be as easy as the invasion of Iraq.   I for one believe only a stiff combination of diplomacy and the threat of action can push North Korea away from the further development of a nuclear weapons program. Our only choice is to make it worth more to them(in food and technical aid)to go without nuclear weapons.   &nbsp;

      In the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, many of of us who opposed the war began to wonder how long it would take the Bush administration to find another target for their doctrine of "pre-emptive" war. &nbsp;Sure enough some of the hawks, swelled with confidence from the largely successful invasion, began saber rattling in the direction of Syria, making accusations that Syria&nbsp;was hiding&nbsp;Saddam's WMDs, assisting leftover Fedeyeen in resisting us, funding terrorists groups throughout the Middle East, and before he was found, of even hiding Saddam himself. Then, amidst the nearly absolute failure of the Administration to prepare for the aftermath of war, the&nbsp;resistence to the occupation&nbsp;began in earnest and all talk of any more invasions withered on the vine as our soldiers found themselves bogged down battling a tenacious insurgency which continues to this day. I for one figured that the hawks had finally realized they'd bitten off more than they could chew, and would realize that they're focus needed to remain on restoring security to Iraq. More war was almost certainly out of the question.   Until  urlLink now  that is.   It seems that I've overestimated the hawks and their commitment to Iraq. I'd always assumed that despite their incredible naivete in how to go about it, they were actually serious about turning Iraq into a shining example of democracy in the Middle East. Articles like Krauthammer's make it clear that, at least for some of the hawks, that's not the case. Krauthammer sincerely believes that the threat of nuclear weapons on Iraq is great enough such that we should currently take all of our soldiers battling to secure Iraq and send them flying across the border and into Tehran, to replace the Islamic regime currently in power. Who exactly will be left behind to guard Iraq is not addressed in his column. But it didn't take me long to realize&nbsp;that's not the point. What's left out is that the the reason Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons so feverishly is because of the failure of this administration to deal with the threat&nbsp;sooner, and the lesson they've learned from North Korea that nuclear weapons will actually deter attack from us, not invite it. What we have here is another cynical attempt to distract the American people from a real problem, Iraq, to focus on another problem of seemingly greater urgency, Iran and nuclear weapons. It's an awful lot like what they did the first time around; distracting us from the real threat of Al Queda by pushing the case for war in Iraq. Some hawks seem to think you can play this prank on the American people twice. I for one don't agree, but be on the lookout for more articles like this to appear, as the hawks try desperately to divert the attention from Iraq as they make their case for war in Iran.   As for me, I'll talk more later about what we actually  should  be doing about Iran.   UPDATE: Krauthammer may be on the earliest advocates of war with Iran, but he's not alone. The first step in making this US policy is for the pundits and commentators to throw the idea out there on their blogs, op-eds and websites.&nbsp; Some examples:    urlLink New&nbsp;York Daily News(via FrontpageMagazine.com)    urlLink The Washington Times (predictably trumpeting the threat of Iran)

       Turns out 10 Republicans who might be investigating Tom Delay  urlLink accepted some of his PAC cash &nbsp; and a computer crash  urlLink erased  detailed records from Miami-Dade County's first widespread use of touchscreen voting machines. Meanwhile, a Republican senator  urlLink speaks out  against the Iraq war, while George Bush's  urlLink best defender  against the accustations of "Fahrenheit 9/11" turns out to be one of Osama Bin Laden's brothers. Speaking of Iraq, three sons of an Iraqi provincial governor were  urlLink kidnapped &nbsp;and an army captain has been charged with  urlLink murdering  an Iraqi. But in better news, Democrats&nbsp;today will  urlLink formally nominate  John Kerry as their challenger to President Bush in November and hear from vice presidential running mate John Edwards in a nationally televised speech.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Tomorrow night a man named  urlLink Steve Brozak , who is running for congress in New Jersey, will be speaking at the Democratic National Convention about terrorism and defense. He plans to tell them that&nbsp;John Kerry "offers a real vision ... for making sure we win the war on terror and making sure we have solutions for the Iraqi conflict." He is an  urlLink ex-marine, ex-Republican investment banker  who left his party because of their negative attacks&nbsp;on the patriotism of&nbsp;war veterans such as Max Cleland during the 2002 mid-terms (those ads and Paul Wellstone's death are the only reasons we lost the Senate). Brozak went on the say he saw too many Republicans with the "arrogant attitude that if you ask questions, you're considered disloyal." He is a moderate Democrat&nbsp;who will be hard to attack because of his background and will be a formittable candidate.    &nbsp;  Though he is still a fiscal conservative and social moderate, I am glad to have this guy on our side.&nbsp;Being a military man himself, his split with the Republican Party over that issue is certainly understandable.&nbsp; It is great that he was invited to speak at the convention, and even better that he will speak so strongly about Kerry's ability to protect America in the face of more of the Republicans' lies and distortions. Republicans might have that&nbsp;loon&nbsp;Zell Miller on their side this year, but I'm much more pleased to have Steve Brozak.

      An  urlLink op-ed piece  in today's NY Times discusses the Saudi connection to the 9/11 attacks, and the failure of the 9/11&nbsp; Commission to scrutinize that connection in great detail. I don't entertain many conspiracy theories, but in this case it certainly seems that there is more than meets the eye when talking about Saudi assistance of the 9/11 hijackers. I don't believe there was any official connection by the Saudi government to the terrorists, but I do not rule out the possibility that certain Saudi royals helped to fund Al Queda in general as the group was preparing for these attacks. I do believe that this connection is something that will never get the serious attention it deserves from anyone in our government. The truth is we have far too much at stake in our relationship with the government of Saudi Arabia, in that we have vast economic interests in the oil that is lying under their desert sand.&nbsp;We simply cannot afford to call the Saudi royals to the carpet for any participation they may have had individually or as groups with Islamic terrorists while we remain beholden to the oil that they sell us.&nbsp;Changing this relationship requires a fundamental change in energy policy on our part, away from our reliance upon vast quantities of oil for our cars and our industries. Unfortunately there is no incentive to do this either in the Republican or the Democratic party, as many politicians believe that we Americans are unwilling to make the sacrifices necessary to change our policy. For now we simply must accept the bland assurances of the 9/11 Commission, and wait for&nbsp;a day when our energy policy is not the prime determinant of our national security policy.   &nbsp;

       Today, as I was filling out a job application at a local restaraunt out here in East Texas, I noticed an older&nbsp;man walk in to apply. The rugged man look to be in his 40's; your average&nbsp;conservative blue-collar man wearing a baseball cap with lyrics from a country song on it, blue jeans, and a T-shirt. He quickly started up a conversation with a another, younger man like myself about how his company layed him off two years ago and hasn't been able to find work since. His story was not atypical: He had put a lot of years&nbsp;into the job, but it was all for-not, and he was told to he had 2 days to "get his shit out of there." As I was listening to this, two thoughts occured. The first was that while liberals and conservatives often talk a lot about the economy it terms of statistics, it is nice (or in this case, not) to see the reality of it all.&nbsp; The second, was that this guy is probably a Republican, or at least, votes for them and unfortunately, probably still will in these upcoming elections. I have no doubts&nbsp;about why, it's for the same reasons&nbsp;people have been voting against their own economic interests for awhile&nbsp;- Republican talk of values, less government, and as Toby Keith (who's actually a Democrat) would put it, putting a boot in our enemy's ass. Of course, what it really means is that this man doesn't have a job anymore, in large part due to Republican's disastrous&nbsp;economic policies (it didn't used to be this way, but the Pat Buchanan wing of the party is&nbsp;all but&nbsp;dead). This particular thought continues to sadden me, because this is the kind of guy who should be on our side. But I have no idea if Kerry's economic message is getting through to people like this man, at least down here. Though I don't know if his particular job was&nbsp;lost due to outsourcing, the same basic principle remains:     &nbsp;   Big companies have too much damn power in America and it is time we did something about it.     &nbsp;   Republicans surely won't, but Democrats, with progressives at the grass-roots level like us edging them on, will. So I again think of what I said earlier,&nbsp;we should support the Texas Democratic Party's and Glenn Smith's DriveDemocracy Organization, and get pro-worker Democrats in and pro-corporate Republicans out. It will hard to turn back the tide after a decade of Republican control in Texas and on the national level, but we have to start somewhere. And we will start with guys like the one I met today.

      During his public testimony before the 9/11 commission, Attorney General John Ashcroft attempted to deflect criticism from his own lackluster counterterrorism efforts by pinning the blame on a 1995 memo written by former deputy Attorney General (and current 9/11 commissioner) Jamie Gorelick. Ashcroft said, "The 1995 guidelines and the procedures developed around them imposed draconian barriers, barriers between the law enforcement and intelligence communities. The wall effectively excluded prosecutors from intelligence investigations. The wall left intelligence agents afraid to talk with criminal prosecutors or agents." Ashcroft called the memo "the single greatest structural cause for the September 11 problem."   In their  urlLink final report , the bi-partisan 9/11 commission concluded that Ashcroft's public testimony was false and misleading. The commission bluntly stated that Ashcroft's public testimony did not "fairly or accurately reflect the significance of the 1995 documents and their relevance to the 2001 discussions." Specifically, "The Gorelick memorandum applied to two particular criminal cases, neither of which was involved in the summer 2001 information-sharing discussions." Any barriers between the law enforcement and intelligence communities were not created from written guidelines by internal Justice Department conflicts which "neither Attorney General acted to resolve" prior to 9/11. Even Ashcroft himself has recently backed away from his April testimony before the commission. In a recent document released by the Justice Department, Ashcroft conceded that Gorelick's memo permitted "interaction and information sharing between prosecutors and intelligence officers" and allowed the FBI to use the fruits of an intelligence investigation "in a criminal prosecution." Ashcroft, however, failed to mention that guidelines issued by his own deputy Attorney General, Larry Thompson, were more restrictive because they affirmed the Gorelick memo and added additional requirements.

       Iran's conservative-dominated parliament approved a draft  urlLink bill  that would allow abortion in the first four months of pregnancy if the woman's life is in danger or the fetus is malformed. I think it is sad that most Iranian clerics could support such a bill, whereas earlier this year the South Dakota congress tried to pass a bill that would effectively ban abortion even in these cases. Fortunately, the state senate killed the bill after it was sent back by the governor, but it is very disheartening that conservatives would try to so blatantly undermine the U.S.S.C. on a woman's right to choose. While the Iranian law would not support abortion in the case of unwanted pregnancies, I find it interesting that a place that we criticize as so religiously fundamentalist supports an obvious and pragmantic policy, when some of our own religious leaders and lawmakers at home do not.

       As the House Ethics Committee decided to  urlLink extend their review  of House Majority Leader Tom Delay's illegal&nbsp;use of Enron contributions for Texas races, a recent study by the watchdog group, Campaigns for People, has found most of the 31 members of the Texas Senate draw on the kindness of big campaign donors to help support rich lifestyles they otherwise couldn't afford. The group's biggest discovery&nbsp;was that only 40% of the senators' campaign funds go toward actual campaign activities. The remaining 60%, the report found, paid for lifestyle, office, or miscellaneous expenses. The study, aptly named "Money in All the Wrong Places," is based on an examination of senators' campaign-finance reports filed electronically with the Texas Ethics Commission. The data covered a three-year time period between Jan. 1, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2003.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   This is the kind of thing that would make even the most cynical political observers, including us, cringe.     &nbsp;   More disheartening is that this is happening in our home state, illustrating how much&nbsp;our system is hobbled by ineffective campaign-finance and ethics laws and the amount of influence corporate powers have, even moreso than at the national level. But until we stop electing corporate-backed Republicans and Democrats-in-name-only and change the laws, there's never going to be a difference. We must help the  urlLink Texas Democratic Party  and groups like  urlLink DriveDemocracy  to elect better people, from the grassroots to the national level. Let's start by showing Mr. Tom 'Teaching evolution caused the Columbine shootings" Delay&nbsp;that even redistricting won't stop us from keeping a Democratic majority in our congressional delegation and winning as many state races as possible. From U.S. Senator to your local school board, every vote makes a difference.

       After the Senate failed to pass the Federal Marriage Amendment, the Republican-controlled House passed today the so-called " urlLink Marriage Protection Act " which would prevent the Supreme Court and other courts from ordering states to recognize same-sex unions sanctioned elsewhere.&nbsp; In other words, the law is designed to prohibit these courts from ruling on the constitutionality of gay marriage bans.&nbsp; Did I miss something here? It is not up to legislators to decide what courts can and cannot rule on. This is the most blatant attack on the Constitution and the Seperation of Powers I have ever seen.&nbsp; What makes them think the courts won't just decide this law is unconstitutional (as it so obviously is)&nbsp;anyway? Fortunately, I don't think this will pass the Senate, either by vote or because the Democrats will fillibuster. What happened to conservatives wanting to protect the Constitution? Why would they even want this? What if, say, a Democratic House decided to pass a gun control law that no court could rule on? This is just idiotic.

      So&nbsp;it turns out that all those menacing Arab guys on&nbsp;Mrs. Jacobson's&nbsp;plane were just  urlLink Syrian musicians . In fact as it turns out the security concerns that might have actually been worth heeding in Jacobson's mostly melo-dramatic piece, were  urlLink not that serious after all  (via Political Animal.) Look, I'm not a liberal with my head stuck in the sand. I can understand how a group of dark-skinned Arabic gentleman milling around in my plane might cause some fleeting thoughts of terrorists to leap into the average passenger's brain. However, my response would not be to&nbsp;write a  urlLink 3,000 word mostly hysterical and moderately&nbsp;racist article  that contributes virtually nothing to the debate over airplane security. She leaves me with the impression that the only possible thing we could do to make her feel safer would be to ban large groups of Arabic men, or maybe all Arabic men, from flying in American planes.

"Left unresolved for now is whether intelligence was intentionally misconstrued to justify military action," he said.

        The trial of three Americans accused of jailing, kidnapping and torturing prisoners in Afghanistan was dramatically halted after the FBI returned a "substantial" amount of evidence to Afghan authorities.   Judge Abdul Baset Bahktiari adjourned the trial for seven days to allow the Americans and their four Afghan co-accused time to study the evidence, which prosecutors said had been held by the FBI for more than 20 days.     The defendants, arrested in July for allegedly running a private prison and counter-terrorism operations in Kabul, had earlier accused the Federal Bureau of Investigation of withholding evidence proving their links to US authorities.

       "Voodoo economics."   -how George H.W. Bush referred to Reagan's economic policies      One of the biggest Republican myths is that cutting tax rates for the richest Americans will improve the standard of living for the working class. Supposedly, top-bracket tax breaks will result in more jobs being created, higher wages for the average worker, and an overall upturn in our economy. It’s at the heart of the infamous trickle-down theory, also known as supply-side or Reaganomics after it's biggest supporter. Despite Bush Sr.'s objections, his son and most Republicans ascribe to the same theory. It's hard to see why many people still buy into it, given that in fact, it has never lead to more jobs, higher wages, etc. I mean, anyone living today knows this has not been the case with the Bush tax cuts.  Obviously jobs have not been created and people's financial situation has not only not improved, but gotten worse. Yet, as I stated, many still believe this is a good way to stimulate the economy. This site explains   urlLink  how and why it has not worked    over the last few decades. So next time someone tries to tell you cutting taxes for the wealthy will help you, you can give them the facts about  such "voodoo economics."

So political pundits were wrong! Suprise, surprise.

       The Washington Post has an interesting  urlLink article  about how "on the last day of 2003, in an action so obscure it was not mentioned in any major newspaper in the country" the Bush administration eliminated the OSHA rules for tuberculosis testing. The article goes on to say how "OSHA has altered its regulatory mission to embrace a more business-friendly posture. In the past 3 1/2 years, OSHA, the branch of the Labor Department in charge of workers' well-being, has eliminated nearly five times as many pending standards as it has completed. It has not started any major new health or safety rules, setting Bush apart from the previous three presidents, including Ronald Reagan. The changes within OSHA since George W. Bush took office illustrate the way that this administration has used the regulatory process to redirect the course of government."      So instead of using government agencies to look out for the well-being of people, we are now using it to look out for the well-being of businesses.

       The Associated Press reports dozens of attackers raided a U.N. refugee camp in western Burundi, shooting and hacking to death at least 180 people.  A Burundian Hutu rebel faction claimed responsibility for the attack late Friday near the Congolese border, saying its fighters were in pursuit of Burundian soldiers who fled to the camp from a nearby army position. The assailants screamed war cries as they rushed into the camp and set it ablaze. The camp sheltered Congolese ethnic Tutsi refugees, known as the Banyamulenge, who fled fighting in Congo's troubled border province of South Kivu.      "What we have seen so far are many, many, many bodies of children, women and men," Eliana Nabaa, spokeswoman of the U.N. mission in Congo said. "People were sleeping when the attack happened. People were killed as they tried to escape."      Is it not time we took a real stand against human rights abuses in Africa?

Is killing the followers of a nasty Shiite preacher, killing them at the gates of the most holy shrine of Shiite Muslims all over the world, vital to the national interests of the United States and its allies? And why is it that we are killing Shiites, the wretched of the earth in the secular Sunni Muslim country of Saddam Hussein? That is the same Saddam who murdered the father of the preacher five years ago. Was that our clear intent and realistic objective in invading Iraq? Would the American people and Congress -- and our allies -- have supported a $200 billion war to get preacher Muqtada al-Sadr?"  The answer is, of course, a resounding no.

       "I admit it -- the liberal media were never that powerful, and the whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative failures."   William Kristol, as reported by the New Yorker, 5/22/95      Starting today, I will be starting a new addition to the blog. From time to time I will be posting Republican/conservative myths and busting them. I will start with what is probably the biggest myth, that of the so-called "liberal" bias in the media, ironically, often perpetuated by conservatives in the media on mainstream media programs on mainstream TV and radio networks. Among them include Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Bob Novak, Tucker Carlson, Tim Russert, Lou Dobbs, Judy Woodruff, Tony Snow, Brit Hume, Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, the "Beltway Boys," Dennis Miller, Joe Scarborough and many more. Other major media figures such as Wolf Blitzer, Paula Zahn, Chris Mathews often give pro-Republican points-of-view. FOX News, of course, is a propoganda network for the Republican Party. CNN is little better. The vast majority of radio programs are right-wing. No one denies that. Clear Channel supports Republican causes. There are at least as many major newspapers that are conservative as liberal including the Washington Times, the New York Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Wall Street Journal and in large party, even the editorial pages of the New Tork Times and the Washington Post. Anyone who watched the coverage the Clinton's impeachment, the 2000 election, of the last four years knows whose side the bias supports. Don't believe me? Just visit   urlLink  Media Matters   , or read Al Franken's "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them" and other sources. But for most of you I'm preaching the converted here. The important thing is to fight back. Quite watching CNN or any major news network, except for C-SPAN and PBS. Only listen to NPR and Air America Radio. Read your local alternative papers, like the Dallas Observer and Fort-Worth Weekly here in Texas, and forget anything bought and paid for by big corporations. Tell your representatives you won't tolerate further media consolidarity. And most importantly, point out this bias to your friends, family, and co-workers. We must expose these people for who they are and what they do. It's time for the truth to matter again.

       The recent pressure on reporters to reveal sources in the Valerie Plame investigation could end in a U.S Supreme Court   urlLink  standoff   , according to two leading First Amendment attorneys, one of whom fears several leading Washington reporters could wind up in jail before it's over.      "I think we are headed for a showdown and it would not surprise me in the least to see half a dozen reporters sitting in a jail in D.C.," said Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which monitors such cases. She believes Time magazine and other media outlets "will be willing to take this all the way to the Supreme Court because the atmosphere here has become so difficult for journalists to promise confidentiality that the stakes are too high."      The Supreme Court last ruled on the issue in Branzburg vs. Hayes, the well-known 1972 case that offered a vague split decision. Five justices held that there was no privilege for journalists, but agreed that a qualified privilege should apply in some circumstances, which was the position of the four justices in dissent.

       Jim Wallis   urlLink  argues    that if Democrats simply loosen their stance on abortion rights and made room for pro-life Democrats, many voters who would not normally vote for them now would. Many of these voters, he argues, are heavily religious, but share the beliefs of Democrats on social programs and are against the death penalty and hawkish foreign policy. However, they refuse to vote Democratic because they believe abortion is wrong. First, I would like to say this article makes a few good points. Democrats should take a "pro-choice," but "anti-abortion" stance by promoting programs that would reduce unwanted pregnancies (especially for teenage and low-income women) and reform the adoption process to make abortions less necesarry. To paraphrase President Clinton, abortions should be safe and legal, but rare. No doubt Democrats would do better with pro-life voters to advocate this stance to show that no one really favors abortions. The article also attacks those that base their votes on this one issue, failing to look at other issues that may determine a party's "value of life."       However, there are as many pro-life Democrats and pro-choice Republicans, and one party does not ostracize over this issue more than the other. Republicans may have more pro-choice Republicans speaking at their convention, but that is because these Republicans, namely Schwarzeneggar, Guiliani, and others are among the most popular in the country and the Republicans are hoping to use them to appeal to moderate, independent voters. The choice is purely political, and not because the Republicans believe in representing minority beliefs in their party.      Secondly, say Democrats did become more accepting of pro-life views, even bringing them into the mainstream. I agree that some voters that wouldn't normally vote for Democrats now would, but wouldn't the Democrats run the risk of losing female and liberal voters at the same time? I doubt there would be a net gain, and maybe there would be a net loss. It's the same thing with gay rights, or affirmative action. Many argue if the Democrats were less liberal in their stance they could gain more conservative voters. But where is the political gain in that? Everyone wants to hug the middle, but the farther you go the other side the more people you just drive away from your own base. Few are saying Democrats should start supporting gay marriage or unlimited welfare, but if they didn't take a stance somewhere on that side of the political spectrum, what would even be the point of voting for them as opposed to the Republicans? Really, what would the difference be?

       As a federal judge on ordered "Meet the Press" host Tim Russert and Time magazine's Matthew Cooper to   urlLink  testify    before a grand jury investigating the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame, a new White House scandal has opened over the revealing of the name of a source.       Last week, the administration was desperate to justify their decision to raise the threat level to orange in three states based on activity that occurred over three years ago. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice admitted yesterday that the administration - during a background briefing to reporters - identified Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan as the source of the information that prompted the terror alert. According to Reuters, Khan "had been actively cooperating with intelligence agents to help catch al-Qaida operatives when his name appeared in U.S. newspapers." His identification by the administration likely "cost the United States avaluable source." It is not clear who originally disclosed Khan's name, which first appeared in The New York Times last Monday and was then confirmed by U.S. officials.       His unmasking triggered criticism across the political spectrum, and New York senator Charles Schumer   urlLink  has asked    for an explanation from the White House.       So why did the leak this name to the press? Carelessness, or is there a political motive? Discuss amongst yourselves!      UPDATED: The leak may have allowed al-Qaida suspects to  urlLink escape  and a Time magazine reporter was held in  urlLink contempt  for refusing to testify on the Valerie Plame affair.

       Former presidential hopeful and talk-show host Alan Keyes   has  urlLink agreed  to become Illinois Republicans' U.S. Senate candidate and will announce his intentions Sunday, a senior GOP official said Friday.   Keyes, a resident of Maryland, would face rising Democrat star Barack Obama in the race for the seat of retiring Sen. Peter Fitzgerald,   a Republican. The GOP was forced to look outside Illinois for a candidate after primary winner Jack Ryan dropped out in late June amid embarrassing sex club allegations in his divorce records and their second choice, former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka, decided not to run.      Anyone who knows anything about him knows Alan Keyes is a far right wacko who will lose handily to Obama. Of course, the GOP really just want to put on a little show here by putting two black candidates against each other, going so far as to draft one from out of state. Speaking of, I find some of Keyes' past remarks about Hillary Clinton's run for Senate in New York quite interesting in light of his recent decision:      "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there, so I certainly wouldn't imitate it."      Is hypocricy a requirement for Republican candidates now?    UPDATE: Though running for election to the senate, Keyes   urlLink  argues against    election of senators.

       As defense secretary under President George H.W. Bush, Dick Cheney   urged a presidential veto of legislation that would have given a national intelligence director budget authority over spy agencies run by the Pentagon. The letter Cheney wrote in 1992 addresses an issue now being debated: how much authority a national intelligence director should wield over budgets and personnel at America's 15 spy agencies. About 80 percent of the country's intelligence budget is controlled by the Defense Department.      The bills considered would assign "inappropriate authority to the proposed director of national intelligence who would become the director and manager of internal DOD activities that, in the interest of efficiency and effectiveness, must remain under the authority, direction and control of the secretary of defense," Cheney wrote on March 17, 1992 to Les Aspin, then chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.    Could this be why the current George Bush is against the proposed intelligence advisor having full budgetary authority contrary to the suggestion of the 9/11 commission? Nah, it's unlikely a vice-president would have such influence over the president...

       Four of the five Republicans on the House Ethics Committee, which will review the charges against DeLay next month, have received over $35,000 from an arm of the DeLay operation. They are in no position to conduct an independent investigation. The examination of Tom DeLay's political money machine should be free from the influence of that machine. That can only happen with an independent, outside counsel leading the probe.  urlLink Sign the petition now .

      Serious fighting between insurgent and Iraqi police took place in the  urlLink city of Mosul today , 250 miles north of Baghdad. One part of the story which I found interesting:   "The governor of Mosul, Dored Mohammed Kashmola, said in an interview on Al Jazeera television that eight civilians and four policemen had been were killed. He said Iraqi policemen were patrolling the roads Tuesday night without American troops, who, he said, had withdrawn to their bases."     I think it's become clear that, in large part, American forces are trying to turn over the brunt of the fighting to the Iraqi police and National Guard units. Of course this is good for our soldiers, who are getting killed at a lower rate(although they are still dying in roadside bombings and on patrols.) And it's good politically for the Bush administration, as the American people have more tolerance for the campaign in Iraq when fewer American soldiers are dying. This leaves the question however of whether or not the Iraqi police and military units are up to the task of defending themselves and the Iraqi citizenry. It appears they've vastly approved since Fallujah and Najaf, when many Iraqi units flat-out refused to deploy against the insurgents. But so far the insurgency rages just as hot as it has at anytime in the past year, with the exception of the siege of Fallujah by US Marines. Will the insurgency enjoy greater success in battling home-grown Iraqi units, as opposed to American soldiers? I think this is an open question that's due to be answered in the next few months.

      The Scotsman reports today on the threat of a North Korean missile  urlLink capable of reaching the United States .   "A report carried out for the publication Jane’s Defence Weekly said the two new systems appeared to be based on a decommissioned Soviet submarine-launched ballistic missile."      "Ian Kemp of Jane’s Defence Weekly, said North Korea would only spend the money and effort on developing such missiles if it intended to fit them with nuclear warheads."     The major threat comes from the sea-based launch system which, if mounted on submarine, would be able to launch from anywhere in the ocean and thus in theory be able to hit the United States. Of course the United States navy has been geared since the beginning of the cold war towards hunting down ballistic missile submarines and thus preventing this very thing, and the technological gap between N. Korea armed only with an old Soviet sub and the United States navy is considerable. However I do think it makes clear that North Korea's ultimate goal is to be able to threaten the United States with nuclear weapons, and makes the matter of addressing North Korea's nukes all that more urgent.

       Much of the information that led the authorities to raise the terror alert at several large financial institutions in the New York City and Washington areas Sunday was  urlLink three or four years old , according to intelligence and law enforcement officials. They reported that they had not yet found concrete evidence that a terrorist plot or preparatory surveillance operations were still under way.      One piece of information on one building, which intelligence officials would not name, appears to have been updated in a computer file as late as January 2004, according to a senior intelligence official. But officials could not say yesterday whether that piece of data was the result of active surveillance by al Qaeda or came instead from information about the buildings that is publicly available.       "There is nothing right now that we're hearing that is new," said  urlLink one senior law enforcement official  who was briefed on the alert. "Why did we go to this level? ... I still don't know that."      It seems highly suspicious that years-old intelligence, with little to no indication of being relevant now, would be cause for the terror alerts we saw - unless, of course, the motivation wasn't public safety but rather political. I mean, it's not like it is the first time dated intelligence has been used for political gain...      UPDATE: The   urlLink  same terror alert    was reported on over two years ago.

       As reported by  urlLink Electoral Vote Predictor 2004 :      "A group of Colorado citizens have proposed a change to the state's constitution specifying that Colorado's nine electors be apportioned strictly in proportion to the popular vote. Currently Bush is ahead 48% to 43% there, so under the proposed system, Bush would get five electoral votes and Kerry four electoral votes, instead of nine to zero. The group has turned in petitions containing 130,000 signatures. If about 68,000 of these prove to be valid, the question will be a ballot referendum in November. If it passes, the change takes effect for this year's election. If it makes the ballot, on the evening of Nov. 2, the TV news anchors will probably be saying: 'President Bush won Colorado with 55% of the vote, but we don't know how many votes he will get in the electoral college until they finish recounting the closely fought referendum on changing the Colorado state constitution.' Whoever loses will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which once again may have to rule on the sensitive issue of state's rights. To learn more about what may be the sleeper issue of the year, start   urlLink  here   ."    The article points out that if this had been done this way in 2000, Gore would have won the election. Bush is leading Colorado right now, but is only a few points ahead like last time, so even if he won Kerry would also get a significant number of electoral votes, lessing Bush's chances of winning the election and increasing Kerry's.

       urlLink    A typical cell phone user at North Lake  So I come into work this afternoon, and see sitting out in front of the circulation counter a large fishbowl with green aquarium rocks in it and what appear to be one or two cell phones, on which is taped a large sign that says "Please turn off cell phones...or deposit them here!!!" Now, most people are not going to want to leave their cell phone in a bowl and out of their reach, let alone in a bowl mixed with other strange phones carrying God only knows what diseases. So one would be led to believe the implication is that we wish you to turn you cell phone off before entering. BUT...that's not what the sign says. Clearly, there are two options, including the option to leave the cell phone in the bowl...with no requirement that it be turned off before it is left in the bowl. So you can, in theory, leave your cell phone in the bowl  turned on . And being as this is a public library I can guarantee that at some point some patron will leave their cell phone in the bowl,  turned on . And naturally, that someone will try to call this clever patron while their phone is in this bowl of phones. And that, upon hearing it ringing, the circulation staff member currently occupying the counter will rush to the bowl and begin cursing frantically as they dig through phones and aquarium rocks to determine which of the phones in the bowl is ringing.  In truth I am not entirely opposed to this plan, as I welcome all arrangements that produce amusement in their absurdity, and the failure of the arranger to be aware of all natural outcomes of their action. It is my fondest wish to see this particular outcome before I leave.

       urlLink     The new face of North Lake Library?&nbsp;&nbsp;   For those of you who do not already know, the dream that was the North Lake Community Library is coming to an end. Those brave and dedicated IPL employees that toiled, sweated and cried for the dream of a united Academic/Public library will be scattered like ashes to the wind among the various branches of the Irving Public Library system, broken and allotted like slaves at the auction block under the cruel&nbsp;Alabama sun. &nbsp;Those books which once stood so proudly on our shelves, virtually shouting their vast reservoir of knowledge to our patrons(student and public)will be divvied up like so much pirate treasure booty among the branches of IPL. The children's library, the gleaming jewel in the eye of knowledge that was NLCL, will close, it's lights dimmed forever, no longer able to battle against the ignorance that today runs rampant in the world of the child. Instead what will be left will merely be a shell of its former self, as North Lake college employees take over the many duties they once shared with their comrades-in-arms from IPL, and slave to provide at best 1/2 the service to 1/4 the patrons at 1/8 the level of competence(albeit at 2/3 the price.) Please take a moment to lament the passing of the dream that was NLCL. Alas, poor NLCL, we knew you well...

      Women Say Dentist Made Them Swallow Semen  1 hour, 13 minutes ago Add  urlLink Strange News - AP  to My Yahoo! CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Former employees of a dentist claim the man made female patients unwittingly swallow his semen during visits to his office. Dr. John Hall is accused by the state dental board of violating dentistry's standard of care, engaging in immoral conduct, and committing sexual assault or battery.   Six former patients say he tricked them into swallowing his semen. A seventh claims he jumped on top of her in the dental chair and "began to gyrate against her lower body in a sexual manner."  The dental board suspended Hall's license Nov. 5, after police began investigating allegations by two former employees. In February, it conditionally restored his license, barring him from being alone with female patients.  Hall's lawyers say the dentist has been falsely accused by disgruntled former employees. He was collecting his semen because he was taking Propecia, a drug to promote hair growth, and was concerned about potential side effects that include low sperm count and diminished semen, his lawyer, Emerson Thompson, said.  The dental board heard testimony Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The hearing is to continue next weekend.  The five-member panel will decide whether Hall can keep his license. The case is still being investigated by authorities in Charlotte, Cornelius and Mecklenburg County.  Hall's former assistant Cheryl Lynn MacLeod testified Saturday that she found it odd that Hall began asking her to leave a patient's side to retrieve items that he never used.  She also became suspicious when she overheard him tell patients to "swallow" something, and when she saw him take a syringe out of his lab coat pocket while working beside a patient.  In May 2003, she and former office administrator Susie Hillman took the five syringes from office waste containers and Hall's lab coat pockets and gave them to police.  Hall's lawyer, Thompson, suggested the substance Hall asked patients to swallow could have been a dental product.  But in a sworn deposition read aloud Saturday, Hall's former dental assistant Rhonda Hamilton described several dental products used in Hall's office and none matched the patients' descriptions of what was put in their mouths.  When Cornelius police searched Hall's office Nov. 5, they confiscated five more syringes with Hall's semen from his desk, according to the board and hearing testimony.  Five of the six patients testified Friday. The first, a 40-year-old woman, said she objected when Hall began to put a substance from a syringe into her mouth during a procedure on Sept. 4, telling him: "That smells like sperm."  She said Hall drew back and said, "You're crazy." She said she couldn't taste the substance because her mouth was numb.  Another witness, a 33-year-old woman, said Hall asked his assistant to retrieve something from another room during her appointment in May 2003. While the assistant was gone, she said Hall told her to lie back, open her mouth and swallow.  "When I swallowed I tasted it, and it was semen. ... He told me it was cleaning solution." She said she drove directly to her husband's office nearby and told him what happened, but he and a colleague dismissed the idea. She said she tried to convince herself she was wrong, and contacted police only after hearing about the investigation on the news.

      Alright everyone, I have a new library patron to tell you about.  An African woman comes into Northwest from time to time to get books, and her name is Princess Bempong.&nbsp; Yes that's right, the system has her listed as Princess Bempong (not sure if that's a title or a name, but either way...).&nbsp; She often comes in with her deaf servant who makes extremely loud, yet indiscernable, noises constantly.&nbsp; Sometimes grunts and sometimes groans, and sometimes just hollering.&nbsp; Here is the usual scenario:  Princess Bempong will come up to the counter and will make her servant ask for the books (which of course means just a lot of loud and embarrassing noises).&nbsp; Since no one can discern this fellow's gestures or sounds, she gets frustrated and signs with him for a minute or two (while he's still grunting and groaning) and then finally writes down what she wants, and makes him hand it to us.&nbsp; At this point we can usually help them, since what she writes down is an easy enough request.&nbsp; But what I don't understand is why Princess Bempong doesn't just tell us what she wants...you see I know that she can speak because I've spoken to her on the phone and in person on more than one occassion!  I guess she just wants to make full use of her servant...who knows...

       urlLink     I'd like to tell you something....  There was this guy.&nbsp; He ate his  SHIT!   You see, I have another theory about how humanity can be subdivided, which I came up with in the 11th grade. It involves their reaction to the following statement said in the following way:  "There was this guy (said just a little bit raunchily, but not too much)...(dramatic pause of about a second)...He&nbsp;ate his shit (extend the word "shit" and phrase the sentence in clear iambs.&nbsp; It helps if you raise your eyes a little as you proceed and allow your voice to become raspy.&nbsp; The whole process should flow like a gathering storm).&nbsp; People are guaranteed to react in one way or another.&nbsp;   Type A: Type A will laugh and always laugh.&nbsp; Sometimes they will find it funny, other times strange, but always amused.   Type B: Type B reactions will vary greatly, but the test subject will never laugh.&nbsp; They may look quizzical, vaguely disgusted, annoyed by your profanity, or presumably other, undocumented results.&nbsp;   I have my theories about what exactly being a type one or a type 2 means--perhaps one type is more able to find humor in a cruel world, better adjusted to hearing descriptions of disturbing behavior, or they themselves have been there.&nbsp; I encourage you all to test this hypothesis on your loved ones,&nbsp;and&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;that you will be surprised by how they fall out by type .&nbsp;

Anyway, I was doing some "web surfing," as it's called, and stumbled upon this  urlLink book  that pretty much sums up, I believe, what Jason is going through.  Hell, maybe the next volume will include one of Jason's stories.    OOH-RAH!

      For those of you who have encountered Meredith's strange form of reasoning in the past, this will come as no surprise.&nbsp; And I hope that Nathan can add to this post with his own tales.&nbsp; For those of you who have never dealt with Meredith, let me give you a little example.&nbsp; I pick this example only because it is the most recent:  The other night Patricia was discussing with Meredith the idea that we should count people who go through the wrong side of our entrance/exit gate using a stat-clicker.&nbsp; Meredith then says, "oh yes, and we should add 25 to that count for the Junior Players who come through the back door and never go through our gate."&nbsp; So Patricia says, "ok we'lll start our daily count at 25", and Meredith then says: "but its easier if we just get someone to walk through the gate 25 times instead of adding it to our count."&nbsp; ...&nbsp; ...&nbsp; ...  So apparently its easier to walk through a gate in a circle 25 times than simply adding 25 to some other number.&nbsp; Right...

       urlLink     Softcore lesbo sex intermingled with scifi parody.&nbsp; urlLink       So last night I watched the last half of "Play-mate of the Apes" on Cinemax, which I had heard about from a friend. Thankfully the porn aspect is all&nbsp;lesbian scenes (female astronauts and slaves getting it on), and no beastiality.&nbsp;However, to put it simply, this film is insane. First of all, they really just used whatever&nbsp;apes costumes they could find as opposed to one uniform costume for&nbsp;all the apes. This&nbsp;includes&nbsp; a pink ape, whom is gay. &nbsp;The 'alarm" that goes off at one point is simply a police siren plugged into a wall. The sign pointing to the Forbidden Zone is a computer generated arrow saying "Forbidden Zone." The acting was bad not in the typical porn way, but as if the actors were actually trying to say their lines in the craziest way possible. And, for some reason, at several points in the film the cast of characters suddenly bust a rhyme. But anyway, it certainly got the job done and I recommend it.

       urlLink       Man down!&nbsp;  urlLink         I shall not say I told you so, only that I didn't vote for I, Robot. However, James wanted to avoid crowds so we didn't go see the Bourne Supremacy at a major theater, we went to see I, Robot at the Movie Tavern in Bedford. Now I didn't think this was a bad idea either, just not what I'd prefer. The ill omens began almost as soon as the four of us (James, Amand, Kristina and myself) left Amanda's apartment. James took us down 121 to get to 183 where there happened to be an inordinate amount of traffic. However, we did manage to get there on time anyway. We purchased our tickets and headed into the theater. Our second warning was that the women's bathroom was closed due to some&nbsp;malfunction. The ladies had to temporarily take over the men's room. Not a severe problem. James and I went to find seating for the five of us (Lavonne had joined us). We spotted what seemed to be the ideal location. Now to give you an idea of the layout, this is one of those movie theaters where the attendants come serve food in the theater and the rows of chairs all have little tables in front of them. So we spot a good location over on the left side of the theater. Being on the right side, we began to walk through the row to get over to the left side. Tragedy! As James put his foot down just after passing the first seat, he slipped. I swear, it was almost like watching an act. First his foot went one way, then his foot went the other way, and after struggling valiantly for as long as a second to maintain his balance, James went down! He fell; his left knee took the brunt of the damage. However, he fell in a&nbsp;most spectacular&nbsp;manner. James tilted slightly to the left and came down hard on a cupholder armrest. I kid you not, the cupholder exploded! I'm serious, I saw shards of plastic flying in the air. James quickly got up, but he was obviously wounded. His left foot was hurting and he had a scrape on his knee. James bravely walked over to our chosen seats, eschewing offers of help and protesting that he was ok. Still, when the manager came he did accept a bag of ice. I should point out that the staff of the theater neither covered the seats sharing the broken armrest nor did they mop the floor. Anyhow, with the apologies of the manager, we did temporarily move past this event. Inexplicably, the manager offered James  no compensation  for this mishap! Still, we decided to tough it out. We went ahead and ordered. Kristina and I ordered cheese sticks and a pepperoni pizza. Then the previews started rolling. It was the preview for the new Jet Li movie, but without the sound. We waited, as this sometimes happens, but no sound was forthcoming. But wait! We heard some kind of sound, shortly before we saw the Pepsi advertisement come up  simultaneously  with the preview! It was also playing the music that had been playing before the preview! It took them another preview to get this problem fixed. Finally, when the sound was fixed and the last trailer shown, the movie started rolling. But wait: where's the food? Yes, although the entire rest of the auditorium had been served, we waited. It only took our man another 10 minutes to get there with our order. Of cheese sticks. No pizza ever came our way, although initially we were charged for both. We convinced the server of the error of his ways though. Finally, after the movie was all over we went out of the theater where James and the manager wrote up an incident report (whatever they call it there) and I signed it as well, being the only witness of the event. We left without further event, although I suspect more would have happened if we'd stayed. There was an ominous and ridiculous looking cop there in a huge white Stetson. And that was our night at the movies.

      Before I crash for the night and get up early to catch the rat race, I thought I'd share some things I've learned over the years...  In no particular order:  1.  Starburst Twizzlers and Lime-flavored chips are a recipe for disaster.  2.  Dominoes buffalo wings after a heavy night of drinking is also a none-too-smart idea.  3.  Some milkshakes do not bring boys to the yard.  4.  Apples taste better than Windows.  5.  Never take a picture in a Tijuana strip club.  6.  Daniel is the only one in the world with an interest in forum browsing (click on it in profile if you don't believe me).  7.  It is possible to accidentally uninstall programs from a computer and have an uncle that can do anything.  8.  Expect the unexpected, unless your Nathan, in which case expect a life long struggle with the toilet.  9.  Transos are people too.  10.  FFUSFOSTAR  Thank you and good night!

I think if we put our heads together , we can figure out who should be the most ashamed of his interest/favorite book etc. I think my interest in the book Foucault's Pendulum puts me in with a special class of high-powered mutants.

       For some reason, weird stuff happens a lot when I'm over at the Adams family house.&nbsp;This story happened on one such occasion.    &nbsp;  It was rather late at night and I was sitting on the futon playing some Mario Kart Double Dash (awesome game). John went into some Christian&nbsp;chat room to have some fun. He decided it would be cool to put on the webcam and offer images of me playing Mario Kart on for whoever in the chat room wanted to see.&nbsp; So some guy logged on and IM'ed John.&nbsp; I&nbsp;forget what it was that the guy and John initially wrote, but shortly thereafter the guy wrote, "Show me your ass." I kid you not. John asked me if I wanted to show the guy my ass, but after great consideration I declined. Anyway, I thought that if the guy wanted to see ass, he might like tubgirl. John IM'ed him the link. After a few seconds, the guy wrote back, "That's hot, show me some more." I may not be quoting exactly, but that's close enough. I forget what John did after that, but I was freaked out enough for one night.

      Alright guys, we've all seen this all to many times:  Like just now, for example.&nbsp; A large (or rather staggeringly enormous) woman (or man I suppose) waddles in to the library, goes and finds some books.&nbsp; (Perhaps resting a few times on the way, sweating and panting disgustingly as they go).&nbsp; They finally make it back to the checkout desk and slam their books down exclaiming: "golly I'm tired..." or "whew I'm exhausted" or some such other statement.&nbsp; And what causes all this exhaustion you might ask?&nbsp; Simply walking across a small branch library...what is the world of obesity coming to...

       urlLink     Lovely Ladies "A" and "K"&nbsp; urlLink      Despite what you may have seen on TV, the library business is not entirely a male-dominated profession. Beside the many men slaving away here at IPL to answer your questions and find your books, many a hard-working woman works. Two of them, our personal favorites, are pictured here. "A"(on the left) is one of our resident children's librarians, whose job it is mostly to keep the little buggers out from under our big, manly stomping feet by entertaining them with stories, songs, crafts or by mostly allowing them to sit on the computers and download Dragonball Z and Yu-Gi-Oh pictures in black and white. "K" is entrusted mostly with returning many a valuable book to the shelves on which they belong, so that potential child-molestors have something to peep from behind when searching for underage girls who themselves are desperately trying to study and pretend not to notice the weird old guy checking them out from the gardening section. Yes, I daresay without their female-ness&nbsp;our libraries would be hardly as pleasant to work in.&nbsp; Thank you "A" and "K".

       John has been imploring me to tell the story of the night I almost blacked out on his toilet. I don't know that there's too much to explore here, but I'll give it to you.   A couple of weeks ago I was hanging out one night at John's place. A natural urge came upon me so I went to the bathroom. Something was wrong though. As I sat there, allowing the natural course of events to occur, I suffered from what felt like an intense head rush. My vision narrowed down and I began to lose feeling in my body. I thought perhaps it was normal, but no! I could only see a small patch of wallpaper with my tunnel vision, but I knew this was no ordinary bm. I had to stop it or it might kill me. So I grabbed the rim and tried to slow the process down, but I felt like a truck was driving through me. I realized that strategy wouldn't work, so I accelerated the process. The effort it cost me was immense, and I was shaking and sweating. I only survived because I went empty before I totally blacked out. Still, at the end I was shaken by a violent convulsion and I fell back against the tank of the toilet, sending a candle holder to meet its doom on the floor. For a few moments, I had to sit there just resting. That was the most effort I've ever had to put into an evacuation.   I still don't know why I had that one particularly bad episode, but all I can say is I hope it never happens again.

       urlLink     You sit down for a relaxing evening of computer use, but what's this? Somebody wants you to go to a website? Hmm, www.tubgirl.com, eh? Sounds enticing and sexy, doesn't it? OK, I'll bite, just type it in... Oh dear God, what is that!!!!, you exclaim, closing the browser in horror.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you can purge your IE cache to expunge any physical traces of your visit after the shaking stops, you&nbsp;will never&nbsp;get Norton Systemworks to install inside your tortured mind.  If this scenario sounds familiar, then chances are you were, at one point in your life, tubgirled.&nbsp; Although some people are ultimately able to laugh at their trauma, others never quite seem to be the same after viewing that enigma wrapped up in a mystery wrapped up in a brown geyser.&nbsp; I have noticed two general reactions to the tubgirl phenomenon, which I will dub "A" and "B".   TYPE A: A type "A" tubgirl victim&nbsp;was initially horrified and confused by what they saw, and, in fact, may not be entirely certain what they just looked at.&nbsp; However, any morbid curiosity on their behalf will be quickly swallowed up by one single, all-consuming mania: "Who can I show this too?"&nbsp; My theory is that a type "A" tubgirl victim can only survive what thy have just seen by passing its unholy&nbsp;e-miasma along to another victim.&nbsp; A good analogy to help you understand this would be the movie  The Ring .&nbsp;   TYPE B:&nbsp;Statistical analysis of a sample of&nbsp;type "B" tubgirl victims reveals that most of them are exposed to the phenomenon through a type "A" acquiantance.&nbsp; The type "B" victim's symptoms display themselves similarly for the first few minutes, and they may be confused with type "A" symptoms by the casual observer.&nbsp; However, the type B victim never feels the need to pass the burden of seeing along.&nbsp; Instead, they feel a need to understand who, how&nbsp;and why tubgirl is pressing down on them like a crushing weight.&nbsp; Long-term morbidity data is forthcoming.   My research into this matter has caused me to speculate about the existence of type "C" victims, for want of a better term, who do not seem to be affected by the TG miasma.&nbsp; My best working hypothesis is that these "victims" are not fully human and therefore immune to the condition; however, I can not state this with confidence until I have performed several comparative autopsies.&nbsp; In this matter, I can only hope that Seamus's girlfriend Stacy will come through for me.&nbsp;   In conclusion, to all you type A's out there, rest easy--&nbsp;the danger has already passed.&nbsp; Type B's, you are in my prayers, and we are hard at work on a cure for your condition.&nbsp; Type C's, if you really exist, please come forward.&nbsp; And finally, for those out there who have seen no trauma gushing forth as a fountain&nbsp;&nbsp;as of yet-- if, one day, you see the tub loading on a computer screen, avert your eyes and save your soul!!

You can get this software from  urlLink www.hello.com   You can also make blogs via email, I haven't done this yet but I know its possible.&nbsp; You just email the blog site and it posts what you send.

I also have a blog of my own that I created 10 minutes ago, which I will share with you when I figure out how to.&nbsp; I've been invited by virtue of the fact that I too am a library employee, if only for another two weeks, after which I will become an unemployed law student.

       Aren't blogs for losers and people who want everyone to read their crazy conspiracy theories? But anyway, I like that story about the texshare card. That's crazy. And what about the crazy guy trying to kiss your hand? Oh, and as far as interesting stories go, I only have a short one. Last week I was in my library one night after we'd closed (having returned to use the phone). It was rather dark but I noticed what appeared to be a huge roach crawling up the wall over the Spanish books. I got the flashlight and indeed, it was a huge roach. I decided the only thing to do was use it for target practice and shoot at it with rubber bands. I had shot off several and was on the verge of giving up, but I decided to go for one more. I got the biggest rubber band out of the box that I could find (and I'm talking an 8" diameter here). Amazingly enough, I hit the thing! Unfortunately, I discovered that the rubber band wouldn't do a significant amount of damage. The roach got away. Perhaps I need larger rubber bands.

      Ok here it is:  Not long ago I gave a friend of mine a TexShare card from the library.&nbsp; She then took this TexShare card out of town to a different library that is also on the TexShare system.&nbsp; That library took one look at the card and commented, "oh Irving will give a card to  anyone , even someone from Ohio..." and basically told her that they wouldn't issue her a card since they knew that Irving's policies were so open.&nbsp; Naturally I was unhappy since they offended my friend, my library, and my dignity...so here is what I did:  1.) I discussed this with Logan, who also agreed it was a travesty of everything right in this world, and I then emailed my story/complaint to him which I will forward to the Assistant Director tomorrow.  2.) I emailed the Texas Library Association and reported that a certain small-town library feels they have the right to be selective on TexShare cards they honor based on their interpretation of the other library's policies.&nbsp; We'll see what comes of that.  3.)&nbsp;I emailed the offending party a certain link that starts with  urlLink www.tub &nbsp;... oh wait, this has gone too far already...

The most runny of poos that have tormenting me for the past few days finally relented, i'm sure because I got my hands on some sweet drugs, namely Ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic. This miracle antibiotic has, I think, saved my life at least once and maybe twice while i've been here in India. Since I’ve already amply described my near-toilet experiences with India’s unique strains of explosive diarrhea in previous entries, and plan on writing a book to be named 'The Story of My Experiments with Diarrhea,' I’ll just say that I have gone from near-deathly to definitely alive within the past few days."

       urlLink Perverted-Justice.com - Exposing wannabe perverts on the 'net   Guys you have to check this out.  I saw this website on TV last night.  People posing as young boys and girls have conversations with pedophiles and record them on this webpage.  They not only do this but expose the names, addresses, and screen-names of the perverts!  It's awesome.  I think Nathan is on there somewhere...

      AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -- Toe-licking is not a crime in the Netherlands -- but it may soon be.  A serial toe-licker is prompting lawmakers to consider making such unsolicited attention a criminal offense.  Police arrested a man in Rotterdam earlier this week after a female sunbather complained he unexpectedly licked her bare foot. Other women have also complained. The man has reportedly pursued his fetish for years -- but Rotterdam prosecutors say they are powerless to put their feet down.  A prosecution spokesman told the Rotterdam Daily newspaper, "A lick over the foot doesn't qualify as a crime" -- without an overt sex act.  Two Labor Party members have asked the justice minister to change the law.  In their formal complaint, the men ask how it's possible to "prosecute someone for throwing a cigarette butt or soda can on the ground, but not for this kind of misbehavior."

      You might think that the library would be a clean and quiet place to work, but you would be wrong. Today is a day like any other here. It is no better or worse. While cruising through life's journey this afternoon, I have encountered mold and a crazy lady shouting while carrying what might have been all her worldly possessions on wheels behind her. I didn't catch all of this one sided conversation but I did hear her shout angrily about a girl asking her for a dollar but she didn't have a dollar and the girl should have just asked her mother for it. But...there was no girl. There was however a very concerned citizen who was kind enough to suggest someone do something about her. Unfortunately, she exited the building just as it was getting interesting.

       urlLink     urlLink http://www.blogger.com/profile/1866949  After careful scanning of the groups of people who share my various interests, I have selected The Laird of Madrona as the most shameful to be associated with. From his skirt-like kilt to his mead holster, his appearance is ridiculous to me. I deride his taste in music for nerds who think they're clever, funny and "hip." Above all else, I despise his interest in "cutting capers." Congradulations, Laird!

      Alright, I have determined the easiest way to post images within the blogs. That is, for pictures that are already online, (for images on your computer you would have to use Hello or Flicker). Here is how you do it. To insert an image in your blog, (anywhere in the blog, you don't have to put it at the top) simply click the "Edit HTML" tab while you're typing your message and type this code tag:  I can't type it all in one line or it thinks I'm making a real link to an image.  Type this first   Then   inside   those carats you type this:  IMG SRC = "http.address.com" get it?  So you have the first carat:   then you type:  IMG SRC = " urlLink http://www.address.com " and then you have the last carat: />  You can click over on the "Compose" tab again to see if it worked. Like I said you can put this tag wherever you want, and as many of them as you want. So you can fill your blogs with images of oh-so colorful things.

      This email came to us yesterday at East Branch:   From Maria Redburn  Subject: Shirley Hinton banned from Phone use  Ms. Hinton is an older woman with white hair.  She has been using our phone to call social security.  Yesterday she had a 40 minute phone call and came back for another 20 minutes.    I've seen this lady before. She has crazy hair; I mean, we're talking Don King here. The first time I ever saw her, she came to use our phone to report a crime. She called IPD to report that some lady was selling prescription pharmaceuticals, except it was over in Garland, according to her story. So they told her to call the Garland PD. She did that and spent about thirty minutes trying to explain herself, which involved a lot of speaking very loudly and repeating herself. I thought we should have banned her from the phone before she ever got on, based solely on her smell, but hey, it's not my decision. This last time, she didn't even ask, she pulled over Janis' chair and sat down behind to use our phone, which happened to be behind our counter.

      Since the two things that dominate my thoughts the most are sex and politics, I began to wonder if anyone had ever written any slash-fiction between political figures. Sure, enough I did manage to find one guy. Unfortunately (or not for you guys), it's all gay. Here's  urlLink Blair/Brown  and  urlLink Bush/Chirac . There's more listed  urlLink here , but no links, so you'll have to make do with those.

       urlLink    This comic is not a collector's item   Or rather, I have had some passing but nasty affairs with comics in my youth. Now, I happen to like comics a lot. No, they're not great literature. No, they don't make for the most challenging of reading. And no, calling yourself a "collector" doesn't allow you to escape the shame that you should feel at reading comics as an adult. However, I for one have never loved comics so much that I thought I should try my hand at writing one, or even  urlLink publishing it online . This gentleman's comic is less like the Sunday comic or the super-hero comic, and more like the comics they hide deep in the Dallas Observer...only not as good. But please browse his site and read a few. They may grow on you.
