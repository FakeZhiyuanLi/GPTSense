      so i am reading a cool little book that i am borrowing from mark... its called 'let your life speak' and its written by a certain parker j. palmer... good little read, a small book full of large asertations... and very compelling...  here are a few things that caught me off guard in a sort of zen way...  he speaks of how before we tell our lives where we are going to go or what we are going to be or how we are going to be identified, that we must look into our 'true selves' and find out what they have to say...   Everything in the universe has a nature, which means limits as well as potentials, a truth well known by people who work daily with the things of the world. Making pottery, for example, involves more than telling the clay what to become. The clay presses back on the potter's hands, telling her what it can and cannot do - and if she fails to listen, the outcome will be both frail and ungainly...if the engineer does not honor the nature of the steel or the wood or the stone, his failings will go well beyond aesthetics: the bridge or the building will collapse and put human life in peril.   later he speaks of how that means being brutally honest with ourselves, and venturing through the dark places and remembering them, not covering them up for some great success story... read on...   Many young people today journey in the dark, as the young always have, and we elders do them a disservice when we withhold the shadowy parts of our lives. When I was young, there were very few elders willing to talk about the darkness; most of them pretended that success was all they had ever known. As the darkness began to descend on me in my early twenties, I thought I had deceloped a unique and terminal case of failure.  I did not realize that I had merely embarked on a journey toward joining the human race... [and] as pilgrims must discover if they are to complete their quest, we are led to truth by our weaknesses as well as our strengths.    i really should shower now, pick up my sisters car, and work on prepping tomorrow's discussion... and then go to a concert...

         that is my tattoo that i spoke of the other day... thought the visual might help... or disturb you at how ink under the human epidermis tends to bleed towards itself...  its so funny to me how i want to be esteemed and encouraged... "like me, like me" i cry out without a single word...  tonight i took my 15 year old buddy zach with some of the anchor point folks and my wife to boomers... boomers is kind of a high school hangout it seems... at least this one in north county... anyways, i just remember thinking to myself, i wonder if i look like an old guy?... like, the way i dress, is it so 1997?... and i dont really care, i mean not really, but i want zach to think im cool...  so, i am probably taking this position at a church in east san diego where i will be developing and cultivating the creative consciousness of the student ministry... itll kind of put me in a position to have some influence in some students lives and i am like, will they even listen to me?... i mean, one of the beauty of the post-structuralist, post-establishment mentality is that it thinks for itself (sorta), but the down side is, they dont listen to authority very well...  and i dont want to be authority... god, will i even know what to do with adolescents in groups?... i mean, timber i was okay, but i ended up not agreeing with half the stuff i was doing, like scolding kids for not 'worshipping god with reverance'... what a bunch of bs: i was merely wanting to create a sanitary, controlled environment to achieve a certain response (ie. get kids 'into' it)...  anyways, i am so tired, taking lisa to the airport this morning and all...  mark says i torture myself... stop second guessing yourself, ryan... or maybe i should second guess myself?...

       urlLink a great thread to get in on at emergent village on what is the bible (as in, 'the word of god', 'the cradle for the word of god', not the only word/s of god?)...   drove home from santa cruz this morning and had a chance to grab breakfast with michael toy ( urlLink his blog ) before leaving the bay... nice... a good person to know... he is the gospel in motion... broken, happy, enlightened, dark, thoughtful, carefree, focussed, lost, found... i hope he doesn't mind that i use these words... perhaps i should check with him?... hey michael, you mind?... ... ... ... [no answer...] guess that means its cool... a complex person becoming comfortable with his own flesh...  our own flesh... so, off with the whole spiritual realm metaphor and embrace that we are this flesh, we are not 'in this flesh'... we actually are who we are, inseparable from soul and flesh... or thats my thought... i mean, glorified bodies one day?... the concept of the soul is plato's, not the jews... doesnt mean its wrong, but... hmm... dunno...  been thinking about how i gotta stop thinking and start living... thats what mark said i might consider... to stop thinking about every freaking thing and just live... thats really hard for me... am i being redundant?... did i say this already?... its way easier to philosophize about the poor or loving my neighbors, but still i love to be up here behind my laptop and in the safety of my home... clean and safe...  time to pass out... tomorrow lisa goes to the airport and i return to a busy life of errands... then, i will begin to work on our living room... redoing it just a bit... and other stuff... later...

       urlLink cool article about the origin of 'sin'... or rather a proper understanding of it... very short indeed... just a thought...   mike devries and i have thought of this much... that perhaps the hebraic understanding allows for -- if not demands -- an understanding of evil that does not come from other (ie. satan) but rather from the cancer of goodness...  so, you begin with something beautiful, whole, healthy... and when mis-used turns into something sub-par, something off the mark, something 'sinful'... so what if, and just go with me on this, what if we have created satan (and i could go there some other time) as a personification of evil... just to have a scapegoat, someone to pin it on?... this initiator and promoter of 'bad' things?...  okay, so perhaps instead of good and evil we have good things in proper place and proper time and good things in improper places and times?... like murder, obviously bad... but death in and of itself is not bad, but the improper things surrounding murder?... maybe lustful thoughts is a better example... so loving the design of a woman is not bad, but in improper place, it can be unhealthy, unwhole, sinful?...  just thoughts... more later...

       urlLink Nice review Michael.   Today was a wonderful, clarifying day. May I take you through it?  Woke up at 8am to a phone call, reminding me that I was to meet with Mark (a friend and spiritual director and jesus follower) for several hours to discuss life and stuff.  Left 'round 9am in the Santa Cruz fog. Amazing that it is almost August and there is still cold fog in Santa Cruz... perfect day for a chai latte. I hadn't had one in a while, so I thought I'd treat myself.  The fog burned off just as I was summitting 17 to head into San Jose and up to San Francisco. Clarity finally, though interestingly enough, not quite as beautiful as the mystery-shrouded fog that I had left behind. So... time to change my iPod music from Linford Detweiler's contemplative-piano to Muse's epic-rock-n-roll. Turned it up loud, rolled down the windows. I was sailing.  For San Francisco being as packed with people as it is, the foothills just south of there are spectacularly open and undevelopped... at least from the freeway. Beautiful, I felt like I was in British Colombia or Washington state. Wow.  Made it to Mark's place in the Mission District of SF. Rough neighborhood, lots of character, and lots of local places... I have never been to NYC, but I can only assume that they are sister cities on some level with regards to all the little hole-in-the-wall spots.  Talked of family and vocation and opportunity and I complained and whined and said that I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, yada, yada, yada... and it hit me: Had every conversation with Mark been like this? Had I been repeating conversations each time? I mean, had I not advanced at all since our last talk?  He said that he had just realized the same thing about himself: That we contemplate the same insecurities and doubts and issues over and over. Such is life I guess?  Some clarity by the end of the day. Things I'd love to see change in me. A need to re-center. I think I'll go to the desert for a couple days soon and just "be". The need to be inspired and inspire. The need to stop thinking so much and just live... just live for once, Ryan.  Realized again that the foggy places are where the best art comes from, that is, that good art comes from deep within and often dark places made visible through this portal of canvas or lyric or screen. So I must embrace the fog, but not shun the sunlight. For both are parts of the whole. The yin and the yang.  The other day I was sitting in downtown Santa Cruz (a great place to people watch) before I caught I, Robot, and I looked at my tattoo and thought of what it meant to me today. When I got it those years ago, it was to be a reminder that the greatest virtue I can live by is brokenness, that is, being flexible and moldable and broken before my Creator... and I still hold this true, though perhaps in a different way.  But I realized that the tattoo now took on another meaning: I am a broken human being, my opinion is slanted, my understanding is limited, my vision blurred, my language slurred, my life dimly lit sometimes, my hope often selfish. I am broken; who am I to tell the world how to live "exactly"?  I am here to testify to my own brokenness. My authority on any thing does not come from my perfection in any area, but rather from my recognition that perfection is not a possibility. I cannot tell you how to do something from a place beyond you; I can only tell you what I have learned, how I have failed, how I moved, how I still move.

      three days ago, i realized i had what felt to be overenflamed tastebuds all across my tongue... perhaps 3 or 4 in all... or maybe they were kanker sores or something else that i dont even know about...  the point is, i had no idea just how painful these small things would end up becoming... sunday for lunch i took a walk down the beach to the harbor and got a slice of pizza... i was so excited about the pizza... i could smell it cooking... and each bite was a great pain to bear through... every time something just barely skirted across my tongue, i felt it, and with amazing pains... ouch...  hopefully, these sores or whatever they are, are just passing through... and hopefully theyll be gone before i know it...  but in the meantime, it makes it hard to speak even... perhaps this is a time to hold my tongue?... i dunno... but yesterday, holly and i were driving to santa cruz and i got in this phone conversation with someone with whom there had been a miscommunication and boy i lashed out... it was a bad day... i mean, i had peed on my shoe on accident earlier that day... but instead of listening, i just lashed out...  listen, ryan, listen...  so, we all love to talk, me especially, but perhaps when you become in a social setting 'the talker' then its hard to hear others' perspectives... feeling like you want to be understood, you talk a little more to make sure you are being understood, when the other person just wants to be understood and validated as well...  this was to be my week of listening... tomorrow i am going to san fransisco to see a friend who is a kind of spiritual director for me... kind of a rabbi... and today i am with my in-laws... listen, ryan, listen... i will try...

      i am such a frickin' cynic-negative-energy-deconstructionist-antiestablisment-bastard sometimes... are you?...  i swear, i can critique like an american idol judge... and i think i need to stop... not even just stop, but repent, change ways, move to a more beautiful place...  i read two books this last week... "blue like jazz" (a spiritual memoir by a christian in portland) and "the davinci code" (a pop fiction best seller that contains a great deal of history of the church)... as i read them, i found myself quick to embrace "the davinci code" stuff... was mary magdelene married to christ, did the church suppress certain pieces of information regarding christ or even change his nature... i really tried to buy into dan brown's character's ideas... they were different and refreshing and i guess i am a sort of conspiracy theorist...  "blue like jazz"... well, i like _some_ of what he had to say, but mostly it kinda annoyed me... reminded me of "the catcher in the rye" which i love, but i love it for what it is... an adolescent coming into adulthood... reading "blue like jazz" was an adult's memoirs... non-religious memoirs he said, but... and it bugged me how he used holden caufield's voice as his own... and it bugged me how he kept reducing chrisitan fundamental beliefs into the following: jesus christ is god, the devil is as real as jesus, the bible is the word of god...   okay, so i am not here to explain why i have issues with each of these issues... i mention all this instead to show he easily frustrated i get towards other christians and how open i am to people outside of formal christendom...  i went to a church service last night in carlsbad... kind of a young adult service... lame... we got up and left... i wasnt angry or anything, just couldnt handle being there...  somehow i feel this is all very un-christ-like... and one virture i want to live by is living in the way of jesus...  the gospel is a perspective change... its a free-ing from our present reality to see beyond ourselves, our hangups, our annoyances... to see where god is working in perhaps different ways in others...  god, help me in my cynicism... help it turn to love... not just love to make a change, but love to see that i am broken and see through my own lens of what is right and best and wrong and destructive... help...

      so, we are back from our cruise to the caribbean... what an amazing place... i mean, i have been in california for the past 10 years, been to hawaii (even kauai) and other little islands such as catalina and their waters are beautiful, but this... dis caribbean was amazing... the colors are unexplainable, the culture rich in both tradition and need...  its hard getting off a cruise ship and thinking about the whole 'harder for the rich person to enter the kingdom'... it really messes with you...  but we are so thankful to have gotten this 'survey' experience... now we can head back to central america ala my friend frank, who went for a month to belize, honduras, guatamala and just found his own way around...  so, here are some pics i thought you might like...     here is me scuba-ing in roatan, bay islands, honduras, home of the 2nd largest barrier reef... amazing...      here each of us are on a catamaran in cozumel... free bar... so my father had some too...         mayan ruins in tulum, mexico... most think the mayans came from the orient... interesting... ive always wondered where people in the americas had come from prior to the 1500s...     some girls in belize who begged holly to take their picture...     ya, go ahead and laugh... we had to stop a tour bus for me to get off and pee on some guys private property in mexico... i swear i thought i would take a bullet for this one... but alas, i returned safe and sound...  lots of thinking this week... but i need to get to laundry right now... so the explanation of the title will come later...  cheers friends, ryan...

      so, the thing is is that i have never been that fond of the ocean in reality... now, moving to california back in '95 there was a certain 'fondness' that i was required to have towards it... just to prove that i loved california over texas (my homeland)...  so, i never got into surfing... i never got into sun-bathing or bathing suits for that matter... i am bleach white... er, used to be bleach white...  the last week (just about every day) i have been out boogie boarding each evening... wow, what a change it has made... i feel tired this evening, not frantic... excercise is such a spiritual discipline in utilizing our inspirations and energies on something...       so, i love metaphors... and i have been looking for what the ocean, the waves, the surf, the riptide... what do they all mean?... not like what sermon illustration can i make out of it, but rather, how does it reflect our human condition and god's characteristics?...  so, i swim out and see people, even children, finding ease getting up on the waves... not so much for me at first, but once i find the rhythm, it becomes understandable... once i find the rhythm, then i begin to move to the rhythm... now, i get out of rhythm with the ocean all the and the rhythm changes (or at least seems too...) and i get smashed up by the rhythm that carried me just moments ago... how can this all be?... this ocean is at once simple and supportive and powerful and angry... no sense made of it... i simply cannot explain it... there are those who can... those marine biologists or whoever they are that can see the formula...  anyways, there is this awful riptide this evening... another current that pulls me in another direction... its constant, and sometimes i have to get out of the water, pull my board to shore and walk the beach until i am back to where i started and go out again braving the water that beats me up and then carries me like 100 feet...  so, i am now in love with the ocean... it is saving my soul, one wave at a time...  i wonder if some of my neighbors (who never have darkened the door of any religious establishment) realize how nature reflects the greater story?... hmm...

      so last night was our bible study that we have every other wednesday... we are going through the book of revelation in an attempt to try to understand what this book has to say... you see, i (well all of us in the group, really) was raised to think this is a book about the end of the world... some squirrely vision that some guy has that has turned into best-selling books (gag) and a ploy to get people to 'get right or get left' as the t-shirt says...  as i have been re-evaluating my own theology and concepts of god this last year, i realized that revelation was probably not what i thought it to be... not a step-by-step-literal-things-to-come type thing...  okay, that was just a set-up... this week, we watched a video of rob bell connecting the roman caesar, domitian, with the book of revelation and unveiling many similarities between john's vision and what was going on in the roman empire at that time... the video resolved with the challenge to not bow to any domitian, even if we loose our lives... the conversation quickly went to one person saying that if they were asked to renounce god or die, they'd die... at that point, i felt loss... here's why...  it is way easier to say something like that... it is way more difficult to say that i will lose my life now in an attempt to follow jesus... and so we must explore what living like that means, you know?... we must see that there are other tyrants asking us to bow to them... the biggest tyrant?... the one that tells me that i am my own god, here for my own good, here to get all i can, here to rule, here to make right by my opinions, here to get my own rights, here to cast judgement...  okay, so jesus walks the earth... some think he was god, some think he was the highest form of god's expression of love towards humanity, some think he was a prophet... either way, he walked here and was amazing... he walked amongst the roman empire... he walked our western world... and what did he say?... i can only do what i see the father doing (forfeiting his will), i am here not to judge, but to bring goodness and love, i am here to lay down my life (forfeiting his most basic of rights... to live), i am here to give all i can, to value others, to heal the world (tikkun olam), to live the shemah...  so, it seems clear to me that there is a real death that we as christ's followers must be ready to go through... a very real death to our system of approach to life... and in loosing that life, we live... that's how it works right?...  so, this next month begins an experiment in this way...  holly and i have names for the next 4 weeks... rest/sabbath, listening/inspiration, learning/understanding, evaluation/reconnection... im not gonna go into all this, but on that last week, i suspect we will layout the good and beautiful things in our life up against the self-seeking, convenient things in our lives... then, begin (by god's grace) the pruning process...  time to wake up my friend... time to live...

       urlLink "open source theology - collaborative theology for the emerging church"  is a cool website with some interesting insights...  what a cool idea, that we all participate in our understanding of god... for example, i have an okay understanding of god's fairness, that is, i have no issue with him being fair cause i have never experienced anything that is _so_ bad as to shake my acceptance of his goodness and fairness... a friend though, who has sat through her mother's bout with ms and eventual death, has a harder time grasping the ideas of fairness and prayer and keeping us 'safe'...  another friend says if you pray hard enough and have enough faith, then god will heal you no matter what... now, i completely disagree with him, but i think here we are with three different understandings of god's fairness and the way prayer works, etc... if we can all take into account each others ideas, perhaps we can get somewhere... kind of a democratic way of understanding god, ey?...  i dunno, i'm probably wrong... but maybe not?...

      so i missed them last time when they were here... amazing band...  urlLink 'final straw'  is a great album... my buddy kenny turned me onto them...  urlLink listen?...    urlLink here are their tour dates... wanna come along?...   so, i've been kinda experimenting with my interaction with god... you see, as a youth i was taught three ways to meet with god... they are the sacred triangle of spiritual discipline... they are: read your bible, prayer, go to church.  now, i dont want to get into semantics here, like how you cannot 'go to church', you can only 'be the church'... cause i could ramble on that for hours... instead, i want to look at how empty limiting oneself to those three methods can be dangerous...  actually, i dont want to look at anything except what is going on in my own personal experiment right now...  so, i kinda stopped reading my bible a couple months ago... i pull it out for reference here and there... i even use it to teach... i've ready stuff that goes along with our topics and such, but for personal betterment or whatever, i have stopped... why?... okay, perhaps this is lame, but the reason is simple enough to me: it is so hard to get away from what i think i know about the bible to embrace a fresh perspective of the bible...  now, i have to be honest, christ's teaching still rattle me and remind me of the mystery of god and the love of creator to creation especially to those marginalized by society and the church... so when i turn anywhere for leisure, its almost always the gospels... my neighbor dusty tells me he loves to read the gospels... he's a swell guy who talks loud and uses spectacularly foul words... its an artform almost... he lives downstairs... that is but a sidenote...  okay, step back a sec... i need to embrace my whole journey... we all seem to want to throw away that which shaped us in ways that we don't appreciate... that's fair, but perhaps that's not seeing how we should (or could) see it... perhaps my whole journey is important... including my fundamentalist-jesus-was-a-republican understanding of scriptures... or perhaps it's all worthless and i really need to start anew...  no real answers right now... but there is a  urlLink commentary coming out on the book of colossians  this fall called, subverting the empire, which looks pretty fab... brian notes it is one of the first biblical interpretations given new ways of understanding... could be cool...  okay, its time for a shower and another cup a joe...

      ... perhaps every boy (or person) has those moments of what the hell am i supposed to do with my life, but right now i feel like i am having one... and it's a lonely place... i sometimes feel like i am where i am today because of a deep conviction that i do not want to be a part of the machine that is the american dream... but then again, am i completely naive or fooling myself?... or will i forfeit the future for the present... i don't want to grow up dammit...  i look at the pictures that my wife has put across our refrigerator right now... good friends from college with nice jobs that pay for nice houses and two cars and kids and vacations to foreign lands... and i think, did i want (or do i want) what they've got?... cause if so, my system and approach to life is not getting me there... but i rail against the day-in and day-out of office jobs and being in places where i am valued only by what i can do for 'the man'... or am i already doing that and again being naive?...  i see this one picture... its a picture of me when i was a little boy with a microphone in my hand singing... probably about 6 years old... and i remember my grandma saying something like, "sure, music is a fine dream, but find a real job'... a real job... one that will allow me to buy a new car or travel to fricking europe for 2-3 months or whatever...  so what do i do?... any ideas out there?... help...

      so i am going to look at this (probably as most bloggers do) as an online journal...  today i am prepping for anchor point's gathering this evening... oh, back up... anchor point is a small 'church plant' endeavor/experiment that 'launched' last september... meeting in homes, trying to simply figure out what it means to live in the way of jesus... all of us having our own issues with 'church at large', but not thinking that anchor point is the definitive answer to church problems... its just our own expression of 'church'...  okay, that being said, so i am prepping for this evenings's gathering... some round table discussion guided by your's truly... this evening's topic: tithing.  i came upon an article several weeks ago when i was looking for 'heretical' information regarding the book of revelation and our gross presumptions in our modern-dispensationalist-escapist interpretations of it. anyways, on this guy's website, there was another interesting article on tithing and the christian church.  urlLink the article is here.  interesting stuff really. take it for what it's worth.  here's the deal. i have seen way too much abuse in the church system's regarding money. everyone educated on civil religion puts money and religion together, do they not? i mean it seems like 'money-grubbers' or whatever is a thought that quickly comes to mind regarding pastors... at least of flashy churches... maybe not, maybe it's my own cynicism. hmm.  so, i have been re-evaluating my part-time pastoral salary. here i am telling people to live in rhythm with god in the 'real world' while i myself stay at home on my computer writing things like this or prepping for things like tonight. a little bit of a chasm between, no? so, perhaps i go off payroll, then no money goes to me from the church and we would be freed to do things that seemed important to the early church... ie. helping other jesus communities, meeting the needs of the poor and marginalized, etc. you know?  so, my plan is by fall to go off salary, but i want to 'increase giving' in our community. not to anchor point though.  you see, i think that in the history of the church, being a 'cheerful giver' has been used to manipulate many people into 'getting into heaven' or if not that then to 'win god's favor'... i disagree with this.  i think that giving is part of the abrahamic covenent.  urlLink check out this article by brian mclaren.  it reminds us that if we just seek to be 'blessed by god' and do not 'bless others through that' than we are in great danger of heresy (one that even i would not want to commit).  so, sure giving is important, but the money cannot stay 'in the church'... you know? it's not for us just to bless ourselves in this nice little tax shelter called 501c3. so the journey continues in trying to discover what a church living in the way of christ looks like... or at least looks like in oceanside, california with the people of anchor point. hmm.  okay, i gotta take a shower. its already noon.

      continuing in matthew today, hoping to finish a single run-through before we leave for the desert...  this morning i am reading from chapter 10 on, where jesus puts together the 12 'harvest hands' and sends them out... beautiful charge to them, carry next to nothing, live simply, dont convert, just heal and inform people of the kingdom which is now... live generously, which has been a theme thus far...  so, beginning in verse 17, he says...   "Don't be naive. Some people will impugn your motives, others will smear your reputation - just because you believe in me. Don't be upset when they haul you in before the civil authorities."   so growing up, i always read this as a reminder that people at school would hate me because i was a christian and all that jazz... that people were naturally set against god and christ... this, of course, comes right out of the reformed view of who we are as human beings... that is, totally depraved, or completely bad and in opposition to god... this is our birthright...  but i disagree whole-hearted-ly... i think that there is so much good in people, all people, even those who do not share my religious convictions... ben has a  urlLink great post  on some of this stuff...  so, here is my point... i used to read this as a charge to ryan today... ryan, dont be naive, people will speak falsely about you, yada, yada, yada... the world hates me...  but, what if this is a specific charge to these 12 guys... not charge, but warning... i mean, they were going out to jews to proclaim that their messiah had finally come in the person of jesus (even though there was no political revolution happening yet) and so to believe in jesus meant to overturn their system and really, to them, jesus was a bait and switch messiah... promising kingdom and delivering healing, new ways of living/thinking/loving... a subversive kingdom...  all i am saying is that the jews at that time were in a totally different situation that we are in in our world today... i do not beleive the world is as hostile to christ as i hear people in the south talk about... i even saw some article somewhere... we alienate people that could be curious by automatically assuming that they want to smear us or hate us (because they are of the world, right?)...  anyways, just thoughts...  please pray that these next couple days are clarifying, cleansing, inspiring, and so much more that i cannot even imagine...

      Reading matthew this afternoon, but i am taking a break to reflect on just a couple passages i am reading.   "Don't be flip with the sacred...Don't reduce holy mysteries to slogans. In trying to be relevant, you're only being cute and inviting sacrilege."  "Who preachers  are  is the main thing, not what they say."  "It was apparent that he was living everything he was saying - quite a contrast to their religion teachers! This was the best teaching they had ever heard."   So, I can identify with both sides often. I am the Pharisee. I am the anti-establisment Jesus-follower.  In the emerging church conversation, and as this conversation grows more fully into realized expression, we must head these words that our words are not nearly as important as our lives. To speak of beauty and incarnate truth beyond absolute truth must be compelling life-wise, you know? I myself am tired of speaking of a way of living that I am encouraging others to do and then myself cannot.  God, change me.

      yesterday i watched kauffman's adaptation... very interesting film... its quirky as all his stories are, chaotic as life is, and true as a mirror...  no spoilers or anything, but its interesting how he and his brother are different sides of the same coin, from the same dna... charlie is trying so hard to be original and true to life and genuine and not kitchy at all (and it wrecks his life trying to do so) and then donald is writing all this cliche' stuff and its becoming successful and everyone loves it even though it is others' ideas rehashed at every turn...  i want to do something with my life... something true, something original, something me, something moving, but not sappy, but god, my god, it is so hard... it is full of failure and single-mindedness that leads to social anxiety and depth of lonliness and despair that i sometimes would trade to be a successful kitchy spiritual person... perhaps take up kaballah... or evangelicalism?... or become reformed?... or who knows?...  i am sad because i just from identity to identity trying to make me the new me, the one that i really want to be, but i am always tired and out of breath, and i hear jesus saying come to me all who are weary and burdened and i will give them rest, but i dont know how to come to him anymore it seems...  i am ready to take on new identity, something new to throw myself at and into, but i am so guarded of what i will give myself to...  in the movie, merryl streep's character makes a statement of how all she wants is to be so consumed with any one thing that it gives her purpose and fulfillment and all that stuff... and i hear the voice in the back of my head "be consumed with Me" but i dont know what that means knowing what i know now... that is, its not just a selfish, inward focussed, personal faith which holds me... it is much greater... but what does that mean?...  i have spent the last two days cleaning house... literally, cleaning, vaccuuming, hanging things, tucking things away... i think it makes me feel like i am in control of something at least, and in the chaos of my life, i can at least hide the chaos of my house or bring it to order or at least think its in order...  i think im gonna go read matthew now...

       urlLink this is a site that sells a wonderful smelling pinion cedar incense...  we found this smell when we were in new mexico last october and someone threw a pinion log on the fire and wow, it smells great...  so, the last couple days being home have been good and reflective, but also tiring and full of melancholy moments... just thinking a lot... but to what end i sometimes wonder?...  merton continues to amaze me at his ability to convey foreign concepts in reasonably simple manner... his comparative understandings of zen buddhism and christianity are very compelling... so much of what he says makes complete sense in the abstract, but i find myself wrestling with how this can change my reality, you know?... not just to 'apply' it, but to 'actually live in' it...  okay, well, i am off... going to see the bourne supremacy... nice...

       urlLink geoff has a great way of thinking...   today, me and the misses are off to knott's to ride some roller coasters and such... its a kind of pinch to remind ourselves that we are really alive i guess...  so much spinning through my head these last couple days as my sister might be leaving in december to head back to texas, i am at a crossroads job-wise, i am wondering of the healthy-purposefulness of anchor point, holly is taking a new job, we are fixing up our apartment with the intentions of living here for at least another year and a half or so... here's a pic of the almost finished living room addition...      it feels like everything is up in the air... and who knows... maybe that is good?... marlene said i had steel rods running down my back because i like to control everything... perhaps she is right, and perhaps i need to just let go (and what? let god? how cliche')...  but i guess that i am reminded that some cliches actually start as beautiful quippy summations, reductionistic sure, but still potent for their size and if in the right place...  so, to let go, let go, jump in, just what are you waiting for, its alright, cause there's beauty in the breakdown... thank you frou  frou... and off we go...

      home at last... not that i didnt like minnesota, on the contrary, it was an amazing time and place, but... it is so good to be home in our bed, hanging the new windows we bought from a salvage warehouse on the north shore...  i have been thinking about a conversation i had with marlene at solomon's porch the night before we left... she was commenting on my 'controlling tendancies' and how i needed to allow myself to fail sometimes... to realize my own humanity in this whole divine-human equation... that is, stop controlling so much and leave some room for faith...  she said that often in life we live as if everything thing we do is a pass-fail opportunity... and its just that: black or white... and as i dialogued with holly on the way home, i see this in so many things and places... even in our upbringing, people were cautioning us abuot the decisions we make because one decision could fell the rest of our lives, so make sure you are 'on track', right?...  marlene said there is another way of understanding our journeys that has helped her tremendously and it was not so foreign to hear: life is a grand experiment, so if something blows up (say a little too much sulphur here) then take it out and keep trying new things... the idea is that now is not when i get it 'figured out'... now is an opportunity to see what works and what doesnt, what fits and what strangles, what completes and what takes away, what explodes and what produces healthy reactions... oh, and what might work for this season or that might not work for a different season in the future... or for another person...  just good to know that i am not so much of a f*** up as i sometimes think i am... i mean, i am, but its not so life-altering, its just me and how/who i am right now... on the road to beautiful, seasons always change...

      man, i am in the terminal in las vegas and it smells of smoke, fried food, and stinky people... i have been in at least a dozen or more airports in my life and i cannot think of another airport that smells as bad as this one...  layovers can be cool, like on the way to minnesota we had a cool one, but this one going back sucks... we are both tired, hence frustrated, hence agitated, hence bored, hence blah, blah, blah...   urlLink here are some pics from the trip, sixteen in all...  if you choose no photo, then in the meantime, a story...  so, after spending 5 days with shelly and doug, holly and i decided to give them a break from entertaining us and headed up along lake superior past duluth to grand marais on the coast there... we even touched into canada just for the heck of it...  so, we checked into our little lakeside motel just north of grand marais and decided to take a stab at the superior trail... this trail runs along (at least) the north shore of the lake and is one of the longest trails in the us apparently... so, we took a trailhead just out of our hotel and headed out towards the trail... it was to be a 3 mile or so trek, nothing too crazy...  its kinda nice going down trails like this... i mean this one had all the posted signs and stuff and the rabbit trails were usually guarded by a felled tree as to say, "dont go this way, follow the marked trail" and thats a good thing sometimes cause you can get way off course if your goal is to see the superior trail or whatever...      so the main trailhead is really well groomed and kept up... it runs along this river that has carved a small canyon... but after a while, holly was tired of the main trailhead cause it didnt seem like we were getting close enough to the water, like it was safely several yards in from the river... so, she hopped a log and began down a rabbit trail that led to the river... spectacular view, but i was frustrated... i just wanted to keep to the main trail and eventually make it to the superior trail and stuff... but she wanted this other trail that was not as well kept and i nearly tripped this one time... but then we arrived at its intersection with the river... wow, scary... we were like fifty plus feet up from the river, looking down the canyon walls...  so, i kinda saw the stubborn-ness of me not wanting to leave the path as a metaphor for how most christians (myself included) interact with their chosen 'path' of faith... they find a well marked trail (evangelical for me) and follow it, even clearing the way behind them for others, so people can take the same, incredible path i took... and it can be just like it was for me, but for them... and when we come upon those rabbit trails (ie. questions, different perspectives on 'essential' issues, paths that could lead to other paths of faith, etc.) we note that the way is kinda blocked, so you either hop over the wood or you do as most people do - as i wanted to do that day - and move along on the main trail... after all, to go down the other path is kinda dangerous and gets you 'off track' from the main path... so you can basically guarantee a person's spiritual journey if they'll just stay on track, you know?...  so, to further extend this metaphor and borrow a bit from mike's suggestions... what if the river is god or true experience of god or truth or whatever, our christian tradition may have this view from the top as it were, following the rim of the canyon... well, perhaps used to follow the rim, but the authorities thought itd be better to make a trail that is a little safer and further away from the river... perhaps there are other traditions that are trying to follow the river as well, but perhaps some stay in the basin of the river, perhaps some climb trees... who knows?...  ive got to get on my plane, but i tell you replications of inclusiveness are all around in nature... are there as many replications of exclusivity that are as compelling?...

      when in rome, do as the romans right?... so we are in minneapolis and in that spirit, we went to a show of a local band tonight... an incredible live show... kind of a mix of the postal service and radiohead's kid a without vocals... incredible stuff...  so, i am standing with 150 or so other people and the beats are pounding and i am moving back and forth with the grooves... i am amazed at how the music is moving me... i could stop, but that would be unnatural...  so, i nearly tear up several times... the music is good, but nothing that is _so_ moving that i tear up, right?... i mean, whats up?... and i remember that i have had this feeling several times before in my life, but pushed aside the tears because i didnt understand why i would shed them...  it dawned on me... good art provokes and evokes... so, good art isnt so much there to inspire in the way of giving good ideas or informing us of something... rather, it should connect with something deep within us... no, not connect, but provoke and try to lift the heavy curtain that guards our very heart... does this make sense?... that deep thing inside that we all have (i think) is closed off for most our lives, but art offers this moment when we see or hear or feel or experience something that tries to draw back the curtain, lift the veil...  but i didnt cry tonight... i just shrugged it off and moved my body... fists clinched, moving side to side...  it was beautiful music though... but thats another story...

      so today we spent most of the day working on doug and shelly's new duplex they bought to rent out... cool place with hardwood floors underneath shag carpet... fun to tear stuff up and see the beauty underneath... and tiring...  some good conversation... doug made a comment at lunch that i have been thinking on... he said that our 'theologies' are really kinda like adapters for us to connect the story of god to our lives, our world, the now... so, depending on what time or place or situation we find ourselves in, we use different adapters or even the same one in a different way... but eventually, we begin to see that there may not be a need for an adapter for us to make the connection... hmm... interesting...  interesting because amidst all this deconstruction of what ive been told to believe or this stupid statement of faith i am being asked to consider, i hear my friend mark say that what you believe doesnt matter all that much... no, thats not what he said... he said that thats not the main point really... it does matter... but belief isnt the only shaping force in us, right?... i mean, we are formed in several other ways...  i continue reading my palmer book... amazing in its simplicity... may i share some more of his thoughts?... and then we are off to dinner...   "If we lived close to nature in an agricultural society, the seasons as metaphor and fact would continually frame our lives. But the master metaphor of our era does not come from agriculture - it comes from manufacturing. We do not believe that we "grow" our lives - we believe that we "make" them. Just listen to how we use the word in everyday speech: we make time, make friends, make meaning, make money, make a living, make love.  "From an early age, we absorb our culture's arrogant conviction that we manufacture everything, reducing the world to mere "raw material" that lacks all value until we impose our designs and labor on it."   wow... i need to read that again...

      i have been thinking about the bible (specifically the new testament) in regards to metaphors and how they work in and out of our lives... i am beginning to wonder if the idea of a 'spiritual realm' as different from a 'material realm' could just be metaphor... i mean, dualism was popular when the gospels were written, but i dont buy into the idea one bit... so, i have been wondering if we are to embrace these as metaphor's for 'different realms' when in reality, they are one and the same, just a different angle or perspective...  so, i have been thinking about our current metaphor for understanding who jesus was... or really, who he is now...  you hear phrases like 'i want to fall in love with jesus more and more' or 'he is my lover' or 'i am married to jesus'... now, these are not necessarily bad things, but i have to keep reminding myself that jesus was mediator between us and god, not the new image of god (or maybe he was...), so i think our infatuation may be misplaced... i think the love goes beyond christ to god and we now look to christ as a guide, the one who paved the way, but not as someone to fall more in love with, to be infatuated with...  it really kinda cheapens who christ was/is, dont you think?... to make him into my boyfriend or whatnot?... you can begin to see why some in the intellectual community see evangelical christianity as brain-washed sentiment... i mean, think about it: in love with jesus of nazareth?...  i dunno, just thought i'd throw it out there... perhaps ill post it up as a discussion on the emergent village bb... we shall see...

      in the airport in phoenix, arizona... and i dont know what it is about hot states that make them so cold indoors... its as if they enjoy jumping from extreme to extreme...  read a bit more of palmer's "let your life speak" on the flight... i want to read it slowly because there is so much to really think about on each page, yet the pages turn themselves to quickly... perhaps this inspiration is so refreshing that i dont want the moment to end...  his mentor/friend was henri nouwen, the late mystic who devoted his life to reconciling his humanity with his divinity... coming to grips in his later years by serving full-time in a home for the mentally challenged, where he was no one but henri... i love henri nouwen's books, or at least the couple a few that i have read... i need to read more of them...  at any rate, palmer writes the following words as he looks back on his seasons in life that were marked by clinical depression...   "...depression demands that we reject simplistic answers, both "religious" and "scientific," and learn to embrace mystery, something our culture resists.  Mystery surrounds every deep experience of the human heart: the deeper go into the heart's darkness or its light, the closer we get to the ultimate mystery of God. But our culture wants to turn mysteries into puzzles to be explained or problems to be solved, because maintaining the illusion that we can "straighten things out" makes us feel powerful. Yet mysteries never yield to solutions or fixes - and when we pretend that they do, life becomes not only more banal but also more hopeless, because the fixes never work."   simple thoughts, but so heavy to me... it defines me, how i want to figure things out in order to live instead of living within the things... nouwen had a phrase of  "living the question"  as opposed to always seeking answers... beautiful...  here is another thought of his... regarding the beauty in sinking downward in the hell of depression...   "...embrace this descent into hell as a journey toward selfhood - and a journey toward God."   he goes on to refer to tillich's description of god as the  "ground of being" ... making the connection with our descent into our own failings and successes, our own darkness and light, that these can lead us downward towards god... okay, its not coming to me right now in my own words very well, so ill close with palmers again...   "I had always imagined God to be in the same general direction as everything else that I valued: up. I had to be forced...to understand that the way to God is not up but down."   and i could go on to quote the whole friggin book, but i wont...

      so, we decided that since we plan (for now anyway) to stay at this apartment on the beach in oceanside, then we would like to make it a little more true to us... a little more live-able... a little better balance of dark and light... and stuff...  so here are the pics of phase 1 (of 3)... this phase was to paint the wall, get a new table, put in different bookshelves, hide cables, and hide speakers/manage entertainment center to not be the center of the room, but just a part of it...  you decide...            tomorrow we are off to minneapolis to see doug and shelly... pray for inspiration, god knows i need it...  cheers, ryan and holly...

      so i woke this morning to find out ants had invaded my home... now, ants had been here months ago and were after something that completely alluded me, but this time, they came in the front door and walked about an inch wide straight to my trashcan...  i have been trying to see the good in all things and sure, i can appreciate that ants are here to break things back down to their 'dust'... and for that i am truly greatful, kinda like i am thankful for maggots...  but, in this moment, i hate them... they represent to me now waking up early (8.15am!), something i just cant shake, invasion and frustration... so we windexed them and then vaccuumed them up... nice...  last night as we were lying in bed, after painting our new wall... (here are some pics, by the way...)         anyways, after we finished, we decided to go to bed, watch a movie or something... anyways, turned to the history channel about 11pm and watched a cool program called 'heaven and hell' which was following the program 'the dead sea scrolls'... i love the history channel and all that stuff... i love hearing multiple perspectives... but to be honest, it really only covered few understandings of heaven and hell, primarily from an evangelical and catholic point of view...  okay, so heres a brief timeline of my findings regarding the afterlife...  8000 years ago - egyptians believed you would go to the afterlife, completely intact, no 'soul' nonsense...  6000 years ago - the first jewish manuscripts are to have been originated (at least in story) and it says 'dust to dust', the hope was to bring the kingdom of god to earth, so there was no need to invision a 'heaven', god was the source of all things, so there was no devil, no hell, no place god was not, make sense?...  who knows how many years ago - the jewish fable of job points out that if justice is not found in this life, it is found in the next to be sure...  2500 years ago (?) - under intense persecution and bondage from the persians, the jews adopt their pagan oppressors view of the afterlife, that there is a place of ultimate good, where god exists fully, and there is a place of ultimate evil, which is ruled by satan...  urlLink okay, check this article out...  and then check out 1 chronicles 21:1 and 2 samuel 24.1... the writer substitutes "Satan" for "Jehovah" in the pre-exilic account 2 samuel 24:1...  urlLink another cool article...   christ's time - he speaks of the heavens, the kingdom of god, and paradise... i think  urlLink jasen  will have some thoughts in the future about this as he is reading a book regarding it methinks... now christ talks about evil in the form of a (perhaps metaphorical) person?...  paul's writings - very dualistic, much warning of a personalized enemy as if a person who 'rules this domain', hope is in heaven (a place or an understanding? hmm?)...  revelation - everything goes haywire right about here because there is this guy with a vision...  okay, my stomach is growling and so i must get... ciao baby...

      so, i am being asked to sign a statement of faith (i think) for this new job i am taking... and it has things i dont agree with... now, i dont think they are wrong, but i am not sure that they are the only ways to see things...  my world is turning upside-down as far as how i see things and what i subscribe to both theoretically and actually...   urlLink mike has some interesting thoughts in his last couple entries...  i think the quote he is looking for is 'all theology is heresy'...  urlLink see this random blog's thoughts on that statement...  tony campolo's words apparently... or him quoting someone else, which is more likely...  so, what does the bible really say about itself?... well, that is all on word interpretation, the whole logos thing, jesus as word, etc... scripture (paul says) is it profitable for certain things in life, but of course he is talking about the tanukh, not the gospels or his letters... surely he is not so arrogant to say that his letters are the very breath of god and others arent?... that would border on pharisaical and absurd...  so what are we to do with scripture?... i like mike's thoughts...  okay, i've got to go eat chicken and fix my living room... wish me well...

      so, our experiments continue with anchor point... just seeing what a church of people could look like... you know, we are not that spectacular, still trying to wrestle through our own grief, selfishness, confusion, dogmatism, etc... but i think we all see that the established church is not for us...  a good point was made last night (was it by ben i think?) that in the evangelical church, there are defined corners and edges of a box that the tradition exists in... that is, you can go to any given evangelical church and hear the same 100 sermons at some point in time, safe, three points, and hey, perhaps that is not such a bad thing... i mean, there is a sense of consistency, security, and practicality in this system... you can give people concrete conclusions that will hopefully lead to living specific things out that help us in relation to god...  but, for the five of us that were in my living room last night (and the other three or six that were away), its not enough... we have seen god move out of that little box called evangelicalism too many times... so the established church doesnt work well for us...      rhianon explained that the difference between greek thought (which pervades western culture, including the christian church) and hebraic thought... you see, a person of greek thought will look at this table and say that its messy, that there is a flat part on top that is about 18 inches by 40 or so inches... it is light color wood... it explains it from a, well kind of more scientific thought... at least, from a perspective that is under the assumption that we can know all about this table...  now the hebraic thought would describe it from a more mysterious point of view... describe its shadows, its effects on the things around it, not trying to draw a conclusion too quickly...  so, this is just a metaphor for our discussion last night... that is, how we read (or dont read) our bibles... chara said that it is hard to read her bible in any other way than 'basic instructions before leaving earth' and of course, that is how most of us were taught to read it, disecting it like a science project... seems very greek...  as opposed to letting the stories evoke emotion (joy, gravity, even outrage) and work their way into you... okay, so thats way less qualifiable... and perhaps the 'basic instructions' isnt a bad way, but its an incomplete way... perhaps we have to interact with the mystery as well as the certainty...  man, these thoughts arent coming out as well as they were last night in our discussion... what i began with in this post was saying that we are continuing in our experimentation of what a church could look like... so these next couple weeks, we are eating dinner together, watching a  urlLink nooma™  video and then discussing its implications and then seeing where the conversation goes...  okay, well i am going to listen to ray vanderlan's dust of the rabbi tape this afternoon and begin my study of the gospels that will last me the rest of my life...  on to living, have a good day, ryan...
