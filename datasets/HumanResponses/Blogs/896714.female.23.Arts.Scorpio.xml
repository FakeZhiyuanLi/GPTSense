      so adam obviously did not come to the party, but everyone else did.  it was huge.  about a million people showed up and filled the house.  it was fun, but drunk people are a lot more annoying when youre not drinking then when you are.  i don't know why i decided not to drink.  i think the main reason was because i just ate a lot of wendy's and i was too full, but the other reason was because everyone else in my house was drinking and i like the idea of someone being sober.  a couple bad things happened though. first of all i broke maggie's cd player.  i don't know how really, but i did.  i put all my awesome cd's in there.  (both my modest mouse cd's. i really like them) and then smoking popes started to play and i realized that i didn't really feel like the smoking popes right then so i pressed "disk change" and instead of changing the disk it just broke.  this "error" sign kept flashing.  maggie was pretty upset but mostly it sucked because we just couldnt play music after that.  the second bad thing that happened is that patrick collinsworth stole our toilet paper and rolled our yard.  which is more funny than bad i guess but today it rained and now the toilet paper is super gross. the worst thing that happened was that this guy wanted to set himself on fire.  i know that sounds funny or whatever but it was fucking weird.  he was just wrapped in newspaper for his costume and wanted someone to set him on fire.  i can not explain to you how much this scared me.  i hated it.  he was so drunk and weird and it really ruined my night.  then after that i couldn't sleep because the people next door were singing country music super loud.    anyway it seemed like everyone else had a good time.  i know joe met a girl there because he was talking to her all night and when i tried to explain to him that i was nervous about the fire setting guy he was totally unsympathetic.  well good for joe.  he deserves a girlfriend.    well im going to go see punch drunk love now. i already saw it but it was so good im going to go see it again.

      okay so a lot has happened since wednesday.  we totally went to they might be giants and _______ morris was totally there.  but i was torn between standing up right next to the stage with joe and my other friends or venturing out to stand next to ______.   so mostly i stood up near the stage but then i went to the bathroom mid-set and on my way back i stood next to ______ and said hi.  the great thing about saying hi during a show is that its so loud you have to get really close to them and scream in their ear.  which i did.  I screamed hi and he screamed "how's it going?" and then i said "good, they rock!" and he screamed "yeah they do!"  then we stood next to eachother for a little bit and listened to them and then when they stopped the song i was like "what's your name again?"  (not like i ever knew it before) and he said "adam"  and smiled at me again like that time he smiled at me in class.  it was so great.  so i thought it was a good time to go back to my friends and i said so.  and then i went back up to the front.  adam.  what a great name.  adam morris.  i totally dig it.  anyway i loved tmbg.  they were so good.  and afterwards there was talk of going to cleveland to see there show the next day but that was a 10 hour drive so we didn't end up going.  but john flansburg signed my wallet.  it was only 5 bucks for the wallet too, which isn't bad.  anyway after we left we were all walking out and then i saw adam again and we smiled at eachother.  this is good.    i should have asked adam to our party but i forgot.

      me and maggie just totally skipped class.  i feel awful.  we both had a class at 1pm and instead of going we just went to goodwill instead.  we had to buy stuff for our halloween costumes though.  we're having a party on friday for halloween.  im excited.  anyway class is just going on right now and here we are in the computer lab just updating our blogs.  god i can't wait for tonight.  maggie can't go so i'm just gonna go with joe maxwell but i don't want _______ morris thinking he's my boyfriend so i'll have to be careful.  but i guess i don't want to just be worrying about ______ morris the whole time.  i should really just concentrate on they might be giants.  we'll see what happens.

      okay so i talked to him.  sort of.  during class we watched this documentary and it was really boring. even though i dig documentaries this one was just boring. afterwards we had a discussion about it and the professor asked me what i thought.  so i told her that i thought it was just a propaganda film disguised as a objective documentary. (i sounded super smart)  and then she said 'did anyone else feel that way?' and this guy, who's last name is Morris (i checked the attendance sheet) was like 'i actually thought it was really objective in its thinking' and totally had the opposite opinion of me.  which seems like a bad thing and as he was saying it i got really nervous and my stomach tightened up and everything.  but then after he was done talking he turned and looked at me and smiled! so who cares what he said! he totally smiled at me.  and it wasn't an 'im smarter than you smile' or an 'i feel sorry for you cause you said something dumb' smile.  it was a 'i know im disagreeing with you, but i still think you're smart and cool' smile.  fuck yeah!  so that was fantastic.  and what a great smile!  oh yes, my friend, this is what i call good stuff.  i wasn't able to talk to him after class though because the long haired kid in my class got in my way.  why won't that kid cut his hair.  geez.  anyway, it was great.    so tomorrow is the they might be giants show and im excited.  here are my possible approaches.  1.  don't say anything, just smile and wait for him to say something to me 2. do my best to stand next to him and act surprized when i see him 3. drink and then go talk to him so that if i say something dumb i can blame it on alcohol. 4. just stop worrying about this so much and see what happens. 5. a strange combonation of all four.  if you have an opinion  urlLink pleeeease email me  and tell me what i should do.

      so they might be giants are totally coming to carbondale on wednesday.  i really like them, but i don't know them all that well.  so im trying to prepare by listening to as much tmbg as i can in the next two days.  im super excited.  but honestly half of the reason im trying to prepare this much is because this kid i have a crush on is going.  i plan to try and squeeze myself next to him and if im gonna be squeezed up next to him im gonna have to know the words to these songs.  he is a huge fan i think.  I mean don't get me wrong its not like i don't like they might be giants and im pretending or something.  i just want to look cool in front of this kid, show him that we have something in common.  even if we don't.  god he's hot.  i just know hes an idiot though.  i don't know him well enough to gauge, but he dresses really cool and those guys are usually idiots or total snobs.  god i hope this guy isn't dumb.  he's in one of my lecture classes.  so i've only seen him in there, but he wears tmbg shirts every so often so i assume he'll be at the show.  tomorrow i have class with him so im gonna try to plan my classroom exit along with his and maybe i'll ask him if he's going to the show.  that should be exciting.    meanwhile, my internet is so slow and the printer my mom bought me doesn't work.

      work.  work is giving people equipment and taking the equipment away the next day.  work is getting along with my dutiful co-workers and playing online.  its the easiest job i ever had.  i love it.  today is cold so im wearing my dad's bomber jacket.  i think thats what its called.  its the army green coat with patches on it.  i just came to the realization that coats like that probably aren't cool anymore.  but what can i do.  it's cold out and thats just my jacket.  you know what else probably isn't cool anymore but i still do? i wear longsleeve thermal shirts underneath my regular t-shirts.  i just realized that that stopped being cool in '94.  but i just still do it.

      well i guess i better update the ol' blog because joe maxwell keeps bugging me about it.  i'd really rather be watching the philidelphia story with my friends downstairs, but while im up here i might as well.  did i spell that right? philedelphia? i don't know.  that movie is really funny.  its old and they talk fast so you really have to pay attention to get the jokes but man it makes me laugh.  uh oh my roomate is home so i gotta go grocery shopping.  i hope you're happy joe.

      today was absolutely beautiful outside.  oh lordy it was nice.  me and maggie went to the state park and basked in the glory that is our surrounding nature.  now we're going to go to barnes & noble and research for our disney world trip.  did i mention we are going to disney world?  we are!  we're going in early january and i can't wait.  i think it will be so fun.  anyway we're gonna do some research and start planning.  then i think we're going to watch the 1940's house.  which is this show on pbs/bbc where they take a british family and they live in a pretend 1940's britain.  its so cool.  im already so addicted and i just know maggie's going to love it.  anyway that is today's lame update.

      okay sorry i didn't give you the update on the adam situation.  my internet was down so now i have to go to joe's house to write this.  i wish my internet wasn't down its ruining my groove.  anyway, the adam situation=good.  i managed to talk with him after class.  i planned my exit correctly and landed in the same spot he did.  so i was like "hey, how did you like the they might be giants show?"  and he was like "awesome, blah blah blah, how did you like it" and we talked about the show for a while and how awesome it was.   then the best thing in the world happened.  i said goodbye and started to walk home and behind me i heard "hey!" and it was him.  my heart stopped and 48 degree weather turned to 80 degrees.  "i think were walking to the same place, do you want to walk together?" i smiled and said "sure"  and so he ran up to me and we started to walk home.  it turns out he only lives two block east of me which was good news.  he said he'd seen me walking home before.  i can't believe i've never noticed him.  anyway my house is really close to class but we walked for a good ten minutes.  i tried to get to know him as much as i could but he kept asking questions about me so i couldn't find out much about him.  i know he's a senior and a transfer student.  he's in film theory instead of film production like me, which would explain why i haven't every seen him before. and he's from some city in illinois i've never heard of.  but like i said he mostly asked about me and what projects i was working on and who i hung out with and stuff.  i told him about our halloween party and he said he had heard about it cause some of his friends went.  that made me feel cool that he heard about the party i threw.  i don't know, the whole time it was mostly me trying to act cute and cool and smart and girlie and funny at the same time, which is really hard to do consciously without fucking up.  i mostly tried to act myself but thats really hard to do when your trying.  anyway, we got to my house i was like, "well, this is where i live" and he said "cool, see you next week" and that was it.  i ran up the stairs hardly being able to contain my giggles.  then i told maggie everything and she got really excited too.  it was great.  i hope we walk home together every week.

      so as you may or may not know im in love with elliot smith.  he is my favorite band?  i dont know, artist maybe?  what do you call a guy that sings and plays guitar?  anyway, hes my favorite.  and i don't know what happened to him.  you might remember him, he did the soundtrack for "good will hunting" and he performed at the oscars that year (1998?) anyway he was so cute.  and he put out 5 albums.  the last one he put out was in 2000 and since then i havent heard anything about him.  i look on the websights every once and a while and they havent been updated for three years.  im nervous that he's gone for good.  the least they could do is put up a little note saying hes alive or something.  where did he go?  crap.    tonight i get to see adam.  but before that i have to do some errands and work on my documentary for class tomorrow.  i am also trying to re-edit this old documentary i made but i have to recapture all the media.  final cut pro is pissing me off.  but i think it might be an operator error.  anyway we'll see what happens tonight.

      i think joe is wrong about what he put in his blog.  i don't think we should cater to the minds of our generation.  i mean, i don't know anyone in "our generation" that only watches teen comedies or movies that only relate to college kids.  everybody liked american beauty for god's sake or M.A.S.H and everyone watches the sopranos all the damn time.  everyone likes movies about whatever it doesn't have to be about our generation so why should we need to make films like that to keep our audience.

      the internet is so cool.  isn't it?  it blows my mind.  i have no idea how it works or what it is but i know it like it.  im really bad at understanding stuff like that.  i still havent fully understood how a telephone works or a tv.  they blow my mind those inventions.   they totally blow my mind.  me and joe are supposed to watch chelsea walls tonight.  where is he?    anyway on to the interesting stuff.  at least interesting for me.  i walked home with adam again tonight.  and i touched him.  it was really cold out because its winter and all and i totally held his arm.  i dont know if you know what that means.  but what it means is that adam had his hands in his pockets and i grabbed on to his arm and looped my hand through the hole he had created by putting his hands in his pockets.  it's like the cover of freewheeling bob dylan except instead of a pretty girl and bob dylan it was me and adam.  i pulled the little maneuver while we were crossing the street because we ran a little bit and some cars were coming.  so i was able to hold his arm then and then for the rest of the way home.  we hardly talked though, i think because it was so cold and windy.  everything we said was sort of a scream and it got taken off by the wind before it could fully reach the receiving party's ears.  but it was a great walk home.  i loved touching him.  it made me feel jittery and great.  today = good day.

      so today was my birthday.  and it was the best birthday ever.  at first it was a shit day because i had a hard time at work with my jerk co-worker.  then i had a hard time in class because for some reason my teacher never wants to look at my footage from my movie and its really getting to me and today was another day where he didn't want to see it.  so that was depressing.  then i watched raging bull and got depressed on account of all the frequent wife beating.  and then i got more depressed because that movie is just so good but there is so much wife beating.  after that the second part of my day began and that was the best part.  all day maggie had been telling me that her and the roomates were taking me out to dinner.  so i was excited about dinner.  and then when we got to o'charley's i saw about 15 people in the back of the resteraunt hiding behind menus and then i found out they were all there for me!  it was a surprize party!!  i got my very own surprize party and i was totally surprized!  it was great.  i didn't even know i had that many friends.  there were so many people there i liked and no people there that i didn't like.  it was the best birthday ever.  i got some great presents and i had a blast.  thank you so much maggie for organizing that and thanks to joe maxwell for doing such a good job tricking me.  and thanks to everyone else who came.  what a  great day!  so far being 22 has been the best year of my life.

      today is my birthday.  okay so actually its only the night before my birthday, but technically its my birthday because its 2am.  anyway so far i have gotten two presents i got a cd walkman and some pretty pajamas.  and i got a nice phone call from my best friend dave.  he called me at midnight as soon as it turned my birthday.  that was really nice because i thought he might forget.  but he didn't. what a good friend. we were friends in high school and sometimes i feel like were falling farther apart by the minute so its good to know that he still remembered my birthday.  anyway i hope tomorrow is good.  22 is older than i feel.  but i think ill get used to it.

      okay so i walked home with adam again.  i didn't hold on to his arm this time because...i don't know...i guess i didn't want to come on too strong.  but anyway we had a great conversation about fifilm making and everything.  he thinks about it a lot he says, because he's in film theory so thats what he does.  anyway i've decided that this kid is really smart.  and not just smart in the "i know more than you" kind of way, but smart in the "i have opinions and i think about things" way.  anyway so we were talking about stuff and he mentioned my film.  apparently he went to my film screening in the beginning of the semester and really liked me film.  what a great compliment!  that made me so happy.    so when we got to my house he was like "well, see you later' and i said, "hey do you want to come in and hang out or something?"  he said no.  he said he really had to go home and call his mom before she fell asleep.  which i guess isn't too lame of an excuse.  at least he didn't have to "do homework' or something.  and i don't know what he had to talk to his mom about, but maybe it was important or something.  i dont know.  that was kind of dissapointing, especially since i was nervous and excited about it all day.  the good news is that he said he was going to go to the meeting tomorrow.  there is a meeting about the faculty strike tomorrow and he said for me to save him a seat.  so im excited.  that means he wants to sit next to me.  so thats pretty cool.  anyway hopefully that will go well.  maybe i will ask him to go eat after the meeting.    is it lame to be a forward girl?  is it annoying to be direct and honest or is it more appealing to play games?  i don't know what guys want from me.  sometimes i try to play games but it seems so dishonest.  i hope im not annoying adam, im trying to play this down hard core.  i guess we'll see what he does tomorrow.

      joe maxwell wrote me an email about the art thing.  he said that he only thinks people are artists who do something in order to create art.  he says that the guy doing the local tv commercial is a laborer because they are doing it for a paycheck and nothing else.  so i guess an artist according to joe is someone who considers themself an artist.  that makes sense right.  that way we can let those define for themselves what an artist is.    tonight i get to see adam and hopefully walk home with him.  i think i will invite him to hang out after class.  unfortunately class isnt over until like 10pm so that would be pretty late so i dont know if he would be in to it.  but i guess if he likes me he will be into it.  so we'll see.

      so today i had a fight with a kid in the hallway about what it was to be a film maker and an artist and i found myself acting pretty snobby.  i was saying what i though a true film maker was and that this kid wasn't an artist because they didn't "love film" like i did.  i realize now that i sounded like a big jerk.  and i know i had some valid points but also, who the fuck am i to say what was art and what wasn't and who was an artist and who wasn't.  so it made me think just what kind of person i did consider an artist or who i thought was just a jerk with a camera.    i talked to maggie about it.  she would know i thought because she was so art-crazy and she is around snobby art majors all day.  she said that she considered almost anyone an artist.  anyone who did anything remotely artistic she considered an artist.  which makes sense.  and i don't know if im just full of myself or what, but i have a hardtime thinking of the guy who does the local television commericials an artist.  but when i told maggie this she had a good point.  she said that even those schmucks who make the shitty local commericials put athetic value in what they do and they make certain decisions while editing and shooting that are potentially very artisitic decisions.  which is true.  i dont know.  its  just something ive been struggling with today.  tell me what you think.

      my house smells.  really bad.  its disgusting.  our kitchen floor is like a linoleum lined, unwashed, vagina.    i went to the st. louis film festival this weekend.  it was pretty good.  i saw a lot of really bad films and 3 good ones.  thats it.  i saw three films that i thought were worth driving two hours for.  but i guess three films is not bad.    i was miserable all weekend though on account of my cheek.  i don't think i talked about this yet, but i chewed off my inner cheek.  i know it sounds gross, but actually its really gross.  so i went to get my cavities filled on wednesday and i was really nervous it was going to hurt.  luckily it didn't hurt at all.  and afterwards they told me i would be fine.  but that i shouldn't eat for a couple of hours because i could hurt myself.  so i didn't.  and then 45 minutes later i was famished so i ate a turkey sandwhich and my world fell apart.  i chewed my inner cheek off.  not completely off but i bit down on it hard like three times.  hard like i was trying to consume it.  because i couldn't feel my cheek i could only tell i was eating it by the difference in texture between a turkey sandwhich and a cheek.  (cheek is tougher to chew and tastes more like escargot) so like i said.  i didn't hurt at the time, but now i feels like someone bit through my cheek.  which is true someone did bite through my cheek.  me.  so now i can't eat any foods which requires chewing. i have to survive on a diet of soup and milkshakes.  and while milkshakes for every meal is quite nice, it is not as satisfying as a hamburger.  so yeah all weekend i felt like shit.  except for when i was drinking milkshakes.

      so thanksgiving was okay.  me and maggie went to my mom's boyfriend's house.  which was weird.  but not that weird.  he is nice and all it was just not my house so it wasn't as comfortable as i would like.  but my mom was happy and the food was good.  but it wasn't a great thanksgiving for me.    i can really feel myself growing up.  i don't know if anyone else can but i'm totally ready to graduate from college.  im scared of course, of what the hell im gonna do for a living, but other than that im totally ready to grow up.  at my mom's boyfriend's house there was this 13 year old kid wearing a jimmy eat world sweatshirt and i was like "oh i saw them last year they were really good.  i saw them with weezer." and this girl was like"oh yeah, weezer sucks"  and i felt like such a dork.  i felt so old.  i'm like 10 years older than her and she must think im so stupid.  i couldn't believe how lame i was.  then the other day i was at sonic with maggie and there was this group of high school kids in the parking lot laughing and talking and stuff and i was so intimmidated by them.  it was embarrasing.  anyway im ready to get to the next stage of my life.

      yeah so adam has a girlfriend.  im so stupid.  i was just flirting with him and touching him and holding his arm and everything and he had absolutely no interest in me.  im such an asshole.  i found out because i went to walmart to buy some batteries for this film shoot im working on and he was there with some girl and i went up to him (i literally bounded up to him) and smiled and was like "hey adam" and he was like 'hey anna whats going on.' and so i started talking to him and everything, totaly ignoring this girl he was with and then he said 'oh, im sorry, let me introduce you, this is my girlfriend, kathy'  kathy!  his girlfriend!  kathy!  what a dumb name anyway, kathy sucks.  i hate her.  and i hate myself for acting so in to adam when he was giving me nothing in return.  i should have known.  crap.  but im totally over it.  i didn't even have time to think about it this weekend.  a couple of my friends were shooting their senior thesis this past weekend and i did sound for their movie.  i had maybe six hours of sleep all weekend.  and then last night we stayed up and talked until like 3am so today i didn't wake up until 2pm.  thats too much sleep.  so now i feel awful.  i have a headache and i just feel gross.  i think i might go to the rec center.    maggie is out of town and she should be coming back tonight.  tomorrow we leave for memphis, tn.  thats where my parents live.  maggie is coming home with me for thanksgiving.  im so excited.  i think we will have a lot of fun.  we have been friend since we were freshmen and she's never been to my hometown.  im excited.  my mom told me we are going to make pecan pie from scratch this year i can't wait.  its going to be awesome  shit, i cant believe i graduate this year.

      do you ever let people get away with being jerks just because you don't feel like a conflict.  its a weird feeling when you let something like that happen.  just yesterday, maggie and i went to the rec center to work out and we saved our machines with our cd players and sweatshirts and eveyrthing when we went to the bathroom.  when we got back two girls had stolen our machines.  they knew we were coming back because all our stuff was there, but they took them anyway.  so instead of causing a conflict we just got our stuff and left.  so that was good because then we didn't have to deal with yelling at some girls on the running machines, but at the same time, it was bad because we let some jerks get away with being jerks.  you know?  its a hard decision.

      its popular in commericials now to be real washed out and pastely.  you might recall the milk commericial where the boy goes into the fancy pants chocolate shop and orders real expensive chocolate and then mashes it up and makes chocolate milk out of it.   thats the kind of look im talking about.  everything in that pastel color.  anyway its this trendy look for commercials and eventhough most times i guess trendy = bad, i really like it.  thats all i have to say.

      are you friends with your teachers?  i am.  is that weird?  i just like my teachers, thats all.  i guess im not really friends with them, i don't go see movies with them or go out to the bars after a long day.  i just talk to them and like them.  i think most people are like "fuck teachers". whatever, i think thats so immature.  all that fuck authority crap.  its lame.  teachers are cool, most of the time.  unless they are mean.

      you know what's funny?  hidden camera shows.  the funniest one i've ever seen is called "what do you say to a naked lady?  there is a song and everything.  it goes "what do you says to a naked lady?  do you say how do you do? ...."  its funny.  anyway its this show where ordinary people are in elevators or something and then a naked lady walks in.  and the guy in the elevator is all shocked and everything, but they never do anything like say "why are you naked"  they always just keep riding the elevator and act all normal and everything. its so great.  you can rent it at blockbuster.

      i just did something great tonight.  i got picked up.  not picked up as in someone asked me out on a date at a bar, picked up as in i was sitting here watching tv and my friends came by and picked me up in their car.  i didn't know they were coming, we didn't have anything planned, but they came to my door and i just left with them in their car.  i didn't even know where we were going i just went with them.  i just sat there in the backseat looking out the window listening to the new beck.   it was like a volkswagon commercial.

      okay since maggie wrote in her blog about stuck-on-a-deserted-island food, i have been thinking about it all the time.  i think i might know.  okay for appetizer i would have sushi.  speciffically, the philadelphia roll which consists of salmon and cream cheese wrapped in sea weed and steamed rice.  oh my lord its good.  for my meal i would have coconut fried shrimp with my dad's roasted potatoes and fried okra.  (i think im allowed to have side dishes) then for desert i would have gingerbread cookie ice cream from blue bunny.  that is my perfect meal.   oh man, i love food so much.    i am here in memphis doing nothing.  i wish i was in carbondale hanging out with my friends.  im just so bored.  i came home early so i could hang out with my friend dave but he is hanging out with his other friends so i havent been able to see him.  oh well.

      i have been stinking up the joint all night.  i don't know what i ate tonight that made it smell so bad, but my friends made me get out of the car on mill street tonight because it was so awful.  i know this  is a pretty gross thing to write about, but i keep stinkin it every five minutes so thats all that im thinking about.  we went to a party tonight at our friend margot's house. it was awesome.  we didn't play charades, unfortunatly, but it was still awesome.    i screened my film on friday.  its not finished, im supposed to edit it next semester, but i put together some stuff.  i got a really good response.  i was really happy about that.  a lot of people came up to me afterwards and told me they enjoyed it.  do you go up to people after something like that and tell them they did a good job?  if you don't you really should.  i do it sometimes and i always get real nervous about it.  i always think it will be weird since they don't know me or whatever, but im glad i do it now, because when people told me they liked my stuff it made me feel really good about what i did.  it really encourages me.  so from now on anytime anyone presents something that i like im going to try my best to tell them so.  and i think you should too.

      okay so im at my relatives house and im about to explode.  the shitty thing is, i love coming to my relatives house.  i always have the best time.  i can't stand it now.  its my mother.  she treats me like im 14 years old.  and the only way to deal with someone who treats you like your 14 is to act 14.  and that depresses me.  i have been rolling my eyes and slumping my shoulders and just getting pissed off.  its awful.  i don't know what to do.  if anyone can think of any way to win this battle please tell me because im killing myself.

      so maggie and i are livin it up in north carolina.  today we took our first step to our awesome trip to disney world.  we drove ten hours to my cousin's house in north carolina.  its really fun here so far.  we got to hang out with my godson who is two and is super duper cute.  and we watched an eddie izzard stand up show with my cousin's husband.  eddie izzard is really fucking funny.  anyway the trip went pretty well until we stopped to eat.    we stopped at an ingles.  i don't know if you've ever been to an ingles.  its a grocery store.  we decided to eat at the deli.  you know, they have like fried chicken and potato salad and stuff like that.  so we got some food at the ingles deli and we were really excited.  and then out of no where ingles screwed us.  there we were thinking we were gonna have a great meal at ingles and the really decide to just fuck us over.  the food sucked!  it really blew!  it was cold and hard and reheated and just plain bad.  the only decent thing was the peach cobbler.  and even that was just good because it had warmth to it.  so fuck ingles!  fuck ingles!  the good news is i have a new found admiration for mashed potatos.  i hated them for a while and now i think they're back in my life.  thank god.

      okay p.j. left.  not from my life or anything. just from the rest of my winter vacation. he just went back to pennsylvania.  he's from allentown - like the billy joel song.  anyway he left yesterday morning.  so maggie and i were left to celebrate new years eve all by our lonesome.  we played parcheezie and drank champagne out of beer mugs.  it was pretty cool.  we also watched our disney world info-mercial because tomorrow we leave on our trip.  we are staying at my relatives house (the same relatives i spent christmas with) for four days and then we are on our way to orlando.  man oh man im excited.  but i miss p.j. already.  god he's so cool.  i know i just met him and all of that but i really like him.  the thing i like about him the most i think is that he doesn't seem to feel nervous or awkward like how i do when i first start a relationship.  he seems totally secure with himself and that is so attractive.  he's also really really nice.  like we went to walmart to get snacks the other night and the lady dropped her stuff so he helped her pick it all up and then he let her go ahead of us in line.  i know thats not like saint material or anything but i think its pretty nice.  anyway im totally in love with this guy.  i just wanted to go right out and say that.  and i really hope everyone finds this happiness.  especially joe maxwell.

      i found a boyfriend.  i've only been back in town for two days and i found a boyfriend.  his name is patick james laurant. he goes by pj. he's a french catholic.  well, he doesn't speak french or anything and he was born in this country so far as i know, but his mother and father are french.  anyway, we met in schnuck's.  (i always say you see everyone at schnuck's) and he was buying canned corn and toilet paper and i was buying everything.  we surveyed the meats together.  thats how it happened.  i was trying to find the perfect breast of chicken and he came up behind me and critiqued every piece of meat i picked up.  he made me laugh so much.  and then i asked him who he was and he told me.  and then he came with me to buy razor blades and a loaf a bread and cous cous and milk and eggs and spagetti sauce.  you might think that could have been weird.  like he could have been a weirdo that just went up to girls in the supermarket.  but it wasn't weird.  and when i look back i realize that i was wearing my super cool clothes and that i must have been irresistable to him.  haha.  anyway we went to denny's after that.  he didn't pay for me which i liked.  because even though its nice when guys pay for you. its awkward too.  then i gave him my number and he called me yesterday and we hung out all day!  all day.  we went to see catch me if you can which is an amazing movie.  and a good date movie i think.  and we played nintendo at his house and then ate cheesecake at mine.  we kissed too.  and good thing that worked out because sometimes that can really ruin everything if he can't kiss.  but, no.  he kissed just like i wanted him too.  this guy is almost exactly everything i love.  he's a political science major and an art minor.  and he's cute.  he's not gorgeous or anything (gorgeous guys intimidate me anyway) but he's cute and when he smiles he's really cute.  and anyone who knows me knows that i am a sucker for smiles.  anyway im totally in love with him and we're supposed to hang out today and im so excited.  i can't believe i found someone awesome who thinks im awesome!  this is amazing!

      i think this may be the last time i write in my blog for a while, you see tomorrow we head out for disney world.  im really excited.  first we stay at my other relative's house in tampa and then we head out for orlando tuesday morning.  i can't wait.  we are going camping at fort wilderness and it is going to be cold in florida.  yikes.  fortunately maggie's parents lent us there space heater so we can have warm nights inside the tent.    today i bought some shoes.  i feel bad because a lot of people already have these shoes and im totally stealing their style.  i went to the vans store and bought some checkerboards.  i didn't have a lot of time to choose because we were late for the 4:15 showing of the wild thornberries.  so i picked them and left.  they are pretty neato though.  good news is p.j. called me tonight.  out of no where.  that was really nice.  we only talked for like ten minutes cause he had some friends over but he just wanted to check up on me and i thought that was really cool.  im excited to see him when i get back.  im going straight over to his house.  i miss him. i know this is the crazy in love stage and im trying to play it smart, but its hard when im so crazy in love.

      oh man i ate too much today.  and i drank too much last night.  and im just all in all really overdoing it.  for some reason my relatives really have a fondness for liquor and parcheezie.  i dont know why.  but it does me in every time.  i love parcheezie.  i just discovered it recently.  i got it for christmas from my same board game loving relatives.  its a great game.  in fact on the box it says its the royal game of india.    the place we ate at today was pretty awesome.  it was called razoos. and it was a cajon resteraunt.  i really liked it and it ate soooo much.  it was realy good.  man, i love food.  i eat it almost every day.

      so i spent the night last night.  that's the big news.  i slept over.  now it wasn't like a heated night of love making or anything, we just did the cuddling thing.  but it was amazing.  it felt so good to sleep with him last night.  he wears a tshirt to bed which is so soft and nice. he didn't get sweaty or anything but he was really warm.  i think p.j. has the perfect body for me.  he is exactly one head taller then me so if he stands behind me he can rest his chin on the top of my head.  i think when you can do that with someone its an amazing thing.  i know it sounds dumb but i think it just means you fit together.  anyway i was over his house late watching robin hood prince of thieves and we fell asleep on the couch and then he said "why don't you just stay?"  so i did.  i was nervous though.  i know that all my roomates knew i had slept over there so i was afraid of the taunting and the questions.  but it worked out okay.  and we weren't uncomfortable or anything when we woke up.  he gave me a bowl of lucky charms and we took showers (seperately, we havent done the naked thing yet)  anyway things are moving along.  its so exciting.    in other news im totally scared about my classes this semester.  im taking a physics class and im way confused already.  im taking it with smarty pants joe maxwell and of course he totally gets everything.  but i know this is one of those classes that im going to have to read the chapters and everything.  crap.  besides  physics i have to make a movie still.  well, i have to finish one at least.  then i have to start a whole new documentary on top of that.  the good news is that im working with one of my friends so we'll be able to share the work load (aka i'll make him do everything).  anyway i bought some bear creek broccoli and cheese soup and its very good.

      so maggie just wanted me to tell everyone that she is desperately trying to update her blog but it didn't work and it erased everything she wrote and she's really frusterated.  but she'll do what she can and try to fix it.    today was the first day of classes for my last semester of school.  today was probably the last "first day of school" i'll ever have again.  that is depressing.  i talked to my mom for like an hour tonight about my future and everything.  the "unknown" she calls it.  she actually made me feel a lot better.  i guess i never ask my mom for advise or anything.  i've always kind of wanted to do everything on my own.  but she made me feel good.  she kept saying things like "the world is your oyster"  and "follow your dreams"  it was great.  she also informed me that my frequent and disgusting cough meant i had broncchitis.  which is bad news, but i guess i already knew it in my heart.    so i hung out with p.j. all yesterday and today.  its been great.  he's really in to art though, and i don't know anything about art.  but he's not like patronizing or anything.  he just explains stuff to me, and im not really interested.  i pretend to be interested though.  which is good?  i dont know.  it is probably bad.  maybe maggie can give me some art major pointers.

      okay i'm back.  maggie and i had a great trip.  we had so much fun oh man.  disney world is awesome.  i just love it so much.  im so excited that we went.  we have a lot of stories and everything but i don't want to type them all nor do i think that you want to read them all.  last night, or this morning i guess, we got in at 3am.  we drove all the way from orlando to carbondale.  it was a long drive but it wasn't all that bad.  although there was one city in georgia that was the worst city in the world with confusing streets and gas that sprayed out of nozzels.  it was awful.  anyway im back and i'm hanging out with p.j. tonight.    this relationship seems to be starting off really well with him, but its going a little fast.  not sexually or anything, just emotionally.  i dont know.  anyway im excited about seeing him.  meanwhile i have to go unload the car.

      it is so nice to use the word "boyfriend" regularly now.  its been a year since my last boyfriend and that was a dissaster.  p.j. is pretty great.  the one problem is that he seems to talk about himself a lot.  not like "my name's p.j. and im the greatest" but more like "one time in high school this funny thing happened that i will tell you about for 30 minutes"  but he doesn't seem to listen when i tell him my own stories.  i mean he listens but he doesn't find them as interesting as himself i guess.  anyway i think maybe i should tell him but its an awkward thing to bring up i think.    i also don't really know if i should talk to him about this blog.  and tell him i have this journal.  then he will probably read it and everything.  which would be weird because then i couldn't talk about him i guess.  well i guess ill figure it out later.

      i just got back from ballroom dancing class.  it was so tiring.  i thought it would be really easy, but actually its hard.  we learned swing dancing tonight.  i thought it was going to be like swinging the girls up in the air and flipping them around and everything.  but i didnt get flipped at all.  oh well.  im gonna go eat some pie and watch a documentary.  p.j. is coming over.  he's becoming a regular fixture at the house.

      so we had a party last night.  last night the 17th. not last night the 18th because that's still tonight for me.  anyway it was awesome.  i love our parties.  i had a blast.  p.j. came and it was totally cool.  usually when we have a party we put up fliers in the film hallway and in the art hallway for maggie but this time we didn't so we were afraid no one would come.  but actually there were quite a bit of people here.  it was fun.  i think everyone had a good time.  patrick collinsworth stole our mailbox.  that kid is always up to no good when it comes to our parties.  and some kid he was hanging out with (i forget his name, but i know his last name rhymed with vagina) but up a empty beer case up as a replacement.  but thats as bad as it got.  our friend margot called during the party which was nice.  i wish she didn't move away.  that stinks.  but anyway i had a blast.  i love the party.  i can't wait until next months engagement.   today i bought a new skirt for my ballroom dancing class.  its super pretty.  i also bought two tanktops and a rockin snap down shirt from the gap.  i went with maggie.  man we had a blast.  i hated shopping when i was a kid but today it was a lot of fun.  tonight we watched minority report.  tom cruise is a total dork.

      oh man.  i ate dinner tonight and then after that i ate dinner again.  that is one too many dinners.  maggie and i went out to steak and shake with joe maxwell and our friend chuck.  i had a double chocolate chip milkshake, a grilled cheese sandwich with jelly, a cup of chicken noodle soup and some french fries.  keep in mind i already had dinner!  this is too much food for a girl like me.  too much.  now im going to sleep because who can function with so much stuff in their body.  its just too much!

      the super bowl was fun.  i like watching football.  my family is originally from tampa bay so it was cool that they did so well but i was really going for the raiders at the end.  it would have been an awesome comeback.  but tampa is just the better team.  our friend chuck really likes the raiders and he was sad that they lost.  but really its his own fault for liking the losers.  p.j. was cool with my friends.  they, of course, were really friendly towards him.  he was a little shy at first and didn't say much but then later he joined in boo-ing at the lousy commercials.  its very important to me that my boyfriend isn't clingy.  i need to be able to leave him in a room full of my friends and know that he will be okay.  so it worked out and thats great.  it was nice of him even to come over.  his roomates were having a super bowl party too and i could tell he really wanted to stay home with them.  but he didn't.  he's a good guy.    we are having a valentines day party.  im excited about that.  i know its not for a while but im still excited.  i wonder if pj will do anything for me.  i hope so.

      first of all let me give my good friend chuck a happy birthday shout out because its his 22nd birthday today.  (shout out is a funny thing to say) second of all, good will hunting is such a great movie.  god its good.  i just love it.  i think its so realisitic.  maggie and i watched it tonight.  i cried and cried.  i also made potato salad.  which i looove.    so tomorrow i am going to go through all my clothes and figure out which ones i don't really wear and then give said clothes to good will.  i'll have to hunt for it though, im not sure where there is one around here.  im sorry i know that was lame, but i love cheesey stuff like that.  but really i am going to go through all my clothes and give them away.    im also going to do my homework. i hope.

      so the stupid internet is down and i have to use dial up which i hate.   i just read my "friend" joe maxwell's blog.  you can get to it from my links page.  but basically he totally dogged my boyfriend.  what a jerk.  you're only supposed to do that after i've broken up with him, not while were still dating.  now this sucks because im going to be really defensive of him to everyone and i'll have to pretend like hes perfect when really he's not and ill end up dating him for way longer than i should.  thanks a lot, joe.  jerk.  geez!  what a jerk!  ahhhh!  most likely maxwell is just jealous because p.j. is super cool and has a girlfriend and joe is just sitting at home at his computer every night looking at porn.    ps.  maggie's blog about her pretend cousin is funny.

      my feet really smell.  in fact my whole body isn't doing too well.  i need to take a shower.  but i have to be at work at nine tomorrow morning and i know i wont want to take a shower prior.  so its gonna be a stink day at work too.  poop.  9am is so early.  i cant believe high school started at 7:30am every morning.  i must have gone to sleep at like 10pm.  now i go to sleep at 3am.  crap.  tomorrow is gonna suck.  we are having a party which will be cool i hope.  i had a lot of fun at the last party.    today i got realy upset in physics class.  im taking it with joe maxwell and today we got our first homework assignment back.  now joe and i sat there and did it together.  we had the same answers just worded differently.  he got a 20/20 and i got a 15/20.  i know that a 15 out of 20 isn't bad or anything but i thought i would get a 100.  so it dissapointed me.  plus joe got a higher grade on the test too.  i guess i wasn't mad,really, but it just made me feel bad.  like dumb.   and i know im not stupid.  but i just felt dumb.  i dont know.  and i sit there and listen in class and the teacher talks and i just dont know what the hell he's talking about and joe totally does.  i guess he is just smarter than me is all, but thats hard to accept.  so that was today's dilemma.  now, ironically, i have to read my physics chapter.

      you know whats weird?  when i havent updated my blog in a while i find myself looking back to old entries in order to inform myself of what is going on in my life.  you'd think i'd know that just by remembering what i did that day.  unfortunately, i have about the worst memory of anyone i know.  really, i do.  i can't remember anything.  my mom used to say that she wishes she wouldn't have spent so much time and money on me when i was a kid because i dont remember any of it anyway.  its true i only have a few memories of my entire childhood.  and most of them come from pictures or stories ive heard.  maggie and p.j. are constantly telling me things i said the day before.  sometimes i even get half way through a movie before i remember that ive seen it before.  its awful.    did you know that i loved ice cream?  my favorite flavor is mint chocolate chip.  but not just any mint chocolate chip, breyer's mint chocolate chip.  thats the best ever.  another great flavor is gingerbread cookie by blue bunny.  now thats some good shit.

      okay so i totally did what i said i would do which is go through all my clothes and give a lot of them away.  guess how much i gave away?  5 garbage bags full!  whoa thats a lot!!  i had a lot of fucking clothes.  too many.  so now my closet is happier and so am i. unforutanly good will was closed today so i have to go tomorrow and there are just a bunch of garbage bags blocking the path to my room.  but anyway i got it done.  it was great.  i didnt do any of my homework though.  but i did go visit with maggie's grandparents for about 3 and a half hours.  man oh man they are some talkers.  they're great people and i love them.  especially since i never had grandparents.  but they can talk for a long time.  3 and 1/2 hours to be exact.  tomorrow maggie and i are going out for muffins which im excited about and also i am going to do my homework.  i swear.  p.j. and i have gotten over each other to the extent that we don't have to spend every minute together anymore.  i still like him so much but now i have to start concentrating on school and finishing my movie.  so i think our relationship is maturing a little bit.

      when teachers hold class in the computer lab all people do is check their email and play on the internet the whole time.  i know because i do it.   and because there is a constant click clicking of keys.  my little brother is coming up to school to visit me.  he'll be here tomorrow night. well not really tomorrow night, more like early thursday morning.  at 3am.  but probably wont be until 5am because amtrak sucks it.  anyway im excited about him coming.  he's going to come to my classes with me so that will be cool.  in this class he'll be able to check his email.  which will be nice for him.

      holy shit i want a cheeseburger.  my roomate is making one downstairs and its coming up through the vents and hurting me so much.  its 2am and i really should go to sleep.  i have to go to sleep now but i neeeeed a cheeseburger.  what should i do.  crap.  im so hungry now.  but i know im not actually hungry because i already ate a sub tonight for dinner.  my stomach is just trying to trick me into going to denny's.  this happened once before two years ago.  i remember i called up joe maxwell in the middle of the night and demanded that we go to denny's to get a cheeseburger.  and i swear to this day that that cheeseburger was the best i ever had.  that was also the night i learned how to drive in the snow.  it might have been two years ago exactly because its snowing tonight too.  i wonder if i should call up joe and demand we go to denny's again...hmmmm.....i'll see what he says.

      this morning was so pretty.  i woke up surprising refreshed for only 5 hours of sleep and put on some cordoroys and a soft tshirt (ive given up on taking showers on cold mornings.  its too cold to be naked)  on my way to work i was the first person to make footsteps on the sidewalk.  mind you, you couldn't exactly tell where the sidewalk was, but i started walking where i thought the sidewalk should be.  it was beautiful.  i loved it.  at work the soup lady didnt come.  i guess she was snowed in.  so p.j. brought me some chinese food.  it was so good.  i had garlic shrimp and lo mein.  it was soo good.  and nice of him to come.  what a sweet boy.

      so we had a party.   it was fun.  i really like our parties.  today i have to do a lot of fucking work.  i havent done any work all weekend and its already 2pm and i havent even really started.  plus my fried susan's birthday party is tonight so i have to do everything before that starts.   p.j. spent the night last night and wouldn't leave until just 10 minutes ago.  i like to sleep with him but i just want him to go home after that so that i can start my day, you know.  i dont want to lay around and watch tv.  i want to do my work but instead i have to lay around with him for two hours and then drive him home.  thats why i like sleeping over his house more so that i can just go home and leave him when i want.  i really like p.j.  but he got pretty drunk at our party and started acting stupid.  which is understandable, because people just act stupid when they are drunk.  but its not funny when its your boyfriend.  its more embarrassing.    im glad i decided not to tell p.j. about my blog.  otherwise i would never be able to talk about him.  and that would suck.

      i showed my film today to this judge for the big muddy film festival.  she really liked it.  i have been working so hard on it this past week and now im going to take a break.  no editing for a little bit.  im just going to try and relax.  i am a very very happy girl.

      im trying my best to save a bite of this nerd rope for maggie.  but she doesnt come home for another hour and a half and i dont think i can wait that long.  in fact i know i cant wait that long. oh well i might as well eat all of it now.  there are four different colors of nerds on this nerd rope.  blue, yellow, pink, and white (its easter themed)  and damn if i dont like blue the best.  why is blue always the best flavor of candy.  blue just dominates the candy color world.  you know what doesn't:  grape.  no one ever likes grape.  poor grape.  i feel sorry for grape.  do you ever find yourself eating candy or something and then you try to make everything fair for the candy?  do you know what i mean?  like if you have a handful of skittles and there is a bunch of red but only one yellow, sometimes ill eat all the red first and the yellow ill give some special attention to.  or sometimes ill eat a red then a orange then a yellow then a purple and distribute them all evenly so no color gets jealous of anothe color.  i dont know, maybe i try to please the skittles too much.  i guess if i was really nice i wouldn't eat them at all.

      today i went to walgreens with p.j. and he bought me some nerds ropes.  i dont know if anyone knows what nerds ropes are, but they are brilliant little things.  what it is is nerds candy stuck onto a licorice rope.  (not black licorice though, cherry)  and its amazing.  im obsessed.  i got four today.  2 for a dollar, baby.  ive been so busy lately.  the big muddy film festival is overwhelming.  there are movies playing all the time.  like there is a movie playing right now.  its insane.  but i love it.  the problem is that im showing my film wednesday to one of the judges so i have to do a lot of editing.  im really busy and i hardly have anytime to sleep let alone do anything fun.  p.j., is having problems with this.  he's not so big into independent films so he isn't really as into the big muddy as i am.  and he's upset that i havent been spending anytime with him.  but i have so much shit going on that i just dont have time for that.  i have to worry about graduating on top of that and p.j. doesn't graduate until next year so he doesn't really get that.  sometimes i think having a boyfriend so far removed from my life is a mistake.  since he doesn't do the same thing i do, i have to really try to see him.  i see maggie and joe maxwell more than i see my own boyfriend.  that's not right.    oh well, at least my boyfriend isn't on the internet.

      maggie and i saw the hours last night.  dissapointing.  i really liked all the matched action transitions and the different costumes and stuff.  but all in all it wasn't very intreaguing (i think i spelled that wrong) that stinks i heard it was so good.  oh well.  at least chicago was awesome.  p.j. left this morning.  i think i will have fun here without him.  i know that sounds mean.  but he's just been stifling me lately.  tonight we are going out to lonestar.  i can't wait for that.  i like steak.  a lot.  work is hard today because a million people have been coming in to check out equipment.

      yet another class that takes place in the computer lab.  and another oppurtunity to update the ol' blog.  i saw the pianist.  it blew.  well, it didn't blow, but it didn't do anything for me.  i really wanted to love it.  but i wasnt emotionally attached to the character.  i don't know why.  but i was really dissapointed.  well i should go listen in class now.  i guess.  p.j. leaves tomorrow.

      okay so big muddy is officially over.  it was great, but intense.  i loved it.  i learned so much and i got to hang out with some awesome people.  hopefully i made some friends out of the judges that came this year.  gigantic was absolutely amazing.  and i agree what joe was saying about the jamaicans.  i learned a lot from "life and debt"  the world bank is awful.  its like the jamaican's got that card in monopoly where they had to pay for all the street repairs so they had to mortgage all their property and they just go around the board trying to survive until they land on "go" again.  i know thats a long winded analogy but i think its true. its sad.  anyway it was a great documentary.  but now i have a lot of catching up to do for school and im working on my friends film tomorrow night so i wont have any time then.  oh well.  well its time to go to sleep.  sorry for not updating in a while.

      can i say something here?  i might be a dork or whatever for saying it but i dont care.  i hate pot.  i hate it.  my best friend from high school called me tonight and i was so excited to hear from him.  i hadnt talked to him in like 6 months and he called me high.  what the shit.  you just cant carry on a normal conversation with someone when they are high.  they just can't communicate well.  they ramble and they just sound like idiots.  and here i am talking to this guy i really care about and he is just falling all over himself.  it was sickening.    i've never done well with pot.  i don't even like the way it makes me feel. i think it affects me more than the average person.  because when i used to smoke pot i just ended up crying or something.  i dont know.  i would giggle and giggle and have fun and then all of a sudden i would be crying and i couldn't stop.  i had a totally warped sense of reality and it made me scared.  i couldn't function properly and i didn't like that.  it was never like getting drunk where you cant walk straight and your speech is slurred.  it was like i would be talking to someone and have no idea where or what i had been doing for the past hour.  or what the hell i was talking about.  and i would laugh so hard i couldn't breath and i would actually get scared i couldn't breath. it was awful.  i swore a while ago that i would never smoke pot again.  fuck it.  its not for me.  and i hate it when my friends smoke pot.  it makes me think less of them.  and then i feel bad for thinking less of them.  i wish they would just be themselves.

      you might have read that i went to church this past sunday.  that was the first time i went to church since two christmasses ago.  i don't know why i decided to go again.  i think it might be catholic guilt.  my family used to go every week when i was a kid and now somehow it makes me feel comforted to go.  i feel good saying the prayers and singing the songs.  i don't know why.  is that bad?

      i only have to come in to work an hour a day during spring break.  this is good because its so boring here.  nothing is going on.  it is also bad because its really boring and coming into work for an hour is basically pointless.  i am getting paid $5 a day.  that is a sad sad wage.  the good news is that i slept for 30 minutes of that  hour.  i just laid my head down on the desk and went to sleep.  so now its almost time to go home.  which is great.  because when i go home i can take a nap.  or i can play video games.  chuck bought three gallons of ice cream last night.  it was 3 for 10 dollars at schnucks.  thats a lot of ice cream. i dont know how he's gonna eat it all in half a week.  luckily i get to share.  and that is good because breyers mint chocolate chip is the best ice cream i've ever had.

      yesterday was really fun.  it was a beautiful, beautiful day.  we tossed the football around outside my house for a while and then later after maggie left we went to quiznos.  that place is expensive.  way too expensive for what you get.  that is the last time i go there.  after quiznos chuck and i went to the park to toss the football around somemore.  a bunch of boys came over to play with us. they were fun.  i am pretty good at throwing the football around.  joe maxwell taught me how like three years ago and he's a pretty good teacher.  my form is good but i've got a weak arm.  so i don't throw like a girl but i don't throw like a guy either.  after playing with those kids ive decided that i've got an arm like an eleven year old boy.  which aint bad.      i miss p.j.  i did'nt think that i would but i do.  i don't miss him during the day because im distracted by doing stuff.  but i miss him like crazy at night.  when i go to sleep.  or when i just lay in bed wishing i was asleep next to him.  i don't know if that means i really miss him or i just miss someone to sleep next to.  i don't know.  no one would feel like p.j. feels though.  he's a perfect size for me. aw crap now i miss him more.  crap!    oh well chuck and i are about to head out to church so i better get going.

      holy shit maggie's birthday was awesome.  i tried my best to make it fun for her, but she still made my birthday way cooler.  i couldn't have thrown her a surprize party though because she already did it for me and that would have been stealing her idea.  the best thing i did was wake her up in the morning with "birthday" by the beatles.  i totally jumped on her bed and everything.  it was funny.  today is called crap day.  i just didn't such a great day.  not for any particular reason.  it just stinks.  i got depressed about my movie again.  this happens to me every couple of days.  no big deal.  it happens when i sit in front of the computer trying to edit and then instead just staring for 15 minutes.  and then crying.  its no good really.    ballroom dancing made me so sore tonight.  p.j. is sleeping over and he promises to rub my feet when he gets here.  he should be here soon i hope.  i want to show him my new dvd.  i got the they might be giants video collection.  its called direct from brooklyn.  and it is so cool.  their videos are so good.  'don't let start' is the best video ever made.  and thats the truth.  okay p.j. is here now.  better go.

      sorry i havent posted in so long.  i became depressed and hated the idea of ruining other people with my depression.  i broke up with p.j.  i just stopped liking him.  i don't know how much was him or how much was me.  i knew we wouldn't last past graduation anyway, he's just not husband material.  i know that makes me sound like, i don't know, like i'm just sitting around waiting to get married or something.  i'm not, but why would you stick with someone once your positive you don't want to be with them for the rest of your life.  plus p.j. wasn't fun anymore.  he was a hassle.    all the real girls was the most amazing film i've ever seen.  sorry i didn't post after i saw it, but it was so amazing i couldn't really talk about it for fear of ruining that feeling.  it was the most honest things i've ever watched.  it made me think before i said things.  because thats how the film was, it seemed like everyone in the film was thinking before they said something and so it made me do the same thing.  that happens to me a lot.  i get trapped in the way something is and then i start to live like that.  after i read macbeth in high school my thoughts were in shakespearian tongue for a long time.  and after being addicted to "my so called life" for a while i started adding "like" to every other word of my sentences.  i don't know.  i dont know why i do that.  im numb about breaking up with p.j.  i broke up with him at his house and it took forever.  i didn't feel bad or sorry or anything i just wanted to go home.  i'm glad im finished with him.    i have my period.  what a strange thing that is.  it hurts.  and it changes me.  it makes me insecure and ugly feeling.  and it happens every month.  i hate it.    im going to sleep.  sorry.

      i went home this weekend.  i spent some time with my family.  it was nice.  i saw bringing down the house with my mom.  it was so awful.  i couldn't believe how racist it was.  i know p.j. would have hated it.  he hates racism more than anyone i know.  i think its because his parents are kind of racist.  we are talking now.  not parents and i, p.j. and i.  we made up.  basically i am a jerk.  i go from liking him to not liking him so quickly.  its no good for the relationship.  anyway we talked about it.  i need to a be a little more tolerant and he needs to try and think about my feelings more.  thats all.    i watched the oscars tonight, well half of them.  p.j. couldn't come over but joe maxwell, chuck, and my roomates and i watched it together.  im glad chicago won.  i love that movie.  but i wish adaptation won for screenplay.  it was so good.  the best movie of the year i though.  no, nevermind.  i think punch drunk love was the best movie of the year.  but that wasn't nominated for anything.    you know whats fucked up?  we are totally having a war right now.  i know thats lame to talk about because everyone talks about it.  but its fucked up.  it makes me sad.  and worried.  and tired.  i gotta go to sleep.

      okay so i stopped the p.j. thing.  i cant sleep with him anymore.  he cant handle it.  he keeps saying "if we're still sleeping together and hanging out why cant we date anymore?"  which totally makes sense.  its a totally valid question.  and what am i supposed to say "i dont think you are cool, thats why"?  thats no good.  i cant say that.  so i gotta stop going over there.  and i hate having to explain to my roomates why he still sleeps over when we broke up.  plus i feel guilty that im doing it.  and embarrassed.  and really what is the point of breaking up if im still sleeping with him and hanging out all the time.  thats dumb.  so im stopping.  i told him.  so thats the end of that i guess.

      so my feet totally stink.  it is so gross its all i can think about.  uhhhh, they smell so bad.  its on account of ballroom dancing class.  i just wear these shoes every week and i can see the fungus growing in them.  and then i dance in them for three hours straight.  oh my god i have to wash them right now.  oh god.  they are so gross.

      so i know that what i'm doing with p.j. isn't the best thing to do in the world, but i'm doing it.  and its more complicated then just right or wrong, or fair and unfair.  i'm trying to be honest about myself here.  its hard to break up with someone.  its really hard.  its hard to be able to cuddle and kiss and touch a person one minute and then have to sit next to them and not make contact the next.  its easier to give up and retreat to what it once was.  it feels better that way.  and i know that a lot of people can relate to what im going through right now, but  i can't possibly explain that to someone who's biggest relationship is with his computer.

      i slept over p.j.'s house last night.  i know that is a bad idea.  i just missed him.  and he wanted me to sleep with him.  so i did.  it was selfish.  it was mean too.  i know it confuses him.  it just feels so nice to sleep with him.  especially when im so upset about breaking up with him.  but that only makes it worse.  im a jerk.  the thing is he didn't seem upset with me this morning.  he seemed happy.  which makes me feel lke what i did was okay.  but i know its not.  i'm just so attracted to him.  and so we didn't just sleep together.  we made out and stuff too.  ahhhhh!  why don't i have any will power.

      you know what is awful.  when you tell someone they did something that hurt you and then they go "oh fine, well, soorrry im such a jerk!" all sarcastic and shit. and then they storm off, therefore, turning the tables on you.  thats some cheap shit.  its cowardly and snobby and mean.  and i hate it.

      so i had an interview today at old navy.  i don't think i can work for that corperation.  it sounds like a pain in the ass to work there and i don't even like their clothes.  the good news is i get a discount at the gap which i do like.  it was weird.  it was a group interview.  i don't know if i'll get the job.  but i was certainly the most intelligent person at that table.  although i have a feeling intelligence isn't what old navy is looking for.  one perk about that job is that i'll be able to wear a headset.  that sounds like fun.  anyway they are goign to check my references and call me if i get the job.  i put joe maxwell down as a reference (i didn't actually think they would call) so i hope he doesn't screw me.    i just got back from quatros (best pizza ever) my roomate's mom is in town and she was nice enough to pay for me so that was awesome.  god i love pizza.  its oh so tasty.  why do i love food so much.  i just love it so much.  good think i do though, because you have to eat it to live.  i would hate for it to be a chore.

      i just got back from another night of ballroom dancing.  everytime i come home from that class i have to wash my feet.  they smell so bad.  and i am not the kind of person that often has stinky feet.  tonight we had a test.  i know its ridiculous to have tests in ballroom dancing class, but we did.  i totally screwed up.  i was so clueless as to how to dance.  god i was dumb.  oh well.

      you know whats cool? dating over the internet.  you don't think so? well you should, its totally awesome.    so im making greek stew.  it is sooo good.  its not done yet of course, its takes about two hours to make, but its well worth it.  it tastes like heaven, greek style.  i will now tell you the ingredients: meat, tomatoes, potatos, green beans, cinnamin.  cool huh?  cinnamin is what makes it so good.  oh lord it is good.  i can't wait to eat it.  i will take a shower now i think.

      i love coming home to maggie.  i can really just unload all my problems on her and she totally takes them.  its great.  she just listens to me for like 40 minutes just talk about everything worrying me.  its so nice for someone to listen to you.    i don't have any money.  i know people say that they dont have money but i really dont.  i have -$40.  yup.  thats a negative amount.  so tomorrow i have to go apply for a job.  i'm going to go to lonestar and to barnes and noble and to hobby lobby.  i have to work.  i have to make as much money as possible.  because i have none.  and thats what you do when you have none.  so wish me luck.

      i started work today at old navy.  it wasnt nearly as bad as i expected.  the only bad thing was that i had a mother headache and menstral cramps.  it actually went by really quickly.  i worked in the baby department which was fun.  i think i would like that department the most.  the clothes are so little!  i also worked in the fitting room which was fun.  anyway it was good and i cant wait to use my discount.  but i still have a headache so im gonna go to sleep.

      i just got back home from old navy.  i had my "orientation".  which really just means signing papers.  my first day is tomorrow from 4:45 to10pm.  its exciting to start a new job even if it is a lame one like old navy.  i have a feeling im really going to hate working there.  its a lot of folding clothes and folding clothes, i think.  oh well ill let you know tomorrow.  i also have an interview at best buy on friday.  if that works out ill have two jobs this summer which will be a good thing.  the more money the more stable my life will be.  and the more stable my life is the more i have a chance at surviving.

      i was talking to my friend today.  he is still in high school (sophmore year to be exact) and he was telling me about some girl problems he was having.  and can i say that it is so embarrassing to be a girl.  girls are really dumb.  they are selfish and trite and illogical and emotional.  we just make no sense.  the worst part is, its not just guys that dont know what the hell is going on.  girls dont know what they are doing either.  its awful.  i feel so bad for this kid.  i can't even give him any advice.  its awful.  i cant imagine beign a lesbian, not only do you have to deal with girls but you have to be a girl at the same time.    in other news, maggie hasnt slept for 36 hours and has now affixed herself on the living room couch in a little ball and refuses to move.  now i'll be the first to admit that it is cute, but i feel weird watching tv or sitting next to a lump of sleep.  poor girl she is just so tired.

      the thing underneath me is dumb.  it is dumb because it asks you things like "if you could do one thing what would it be?" and your choices are "bring about world peace, end hunger, be an explorer, kill yourself"  i hate that quizz.  and im not sunrise.  im not any time.  that quiz blows.  take it to see if you think it blows.  and to see what time you stupid are.  by the way i got this from flickerchick's stupid page.  i hate the name flickerchick.  im embarrassed to even type it.  oh god my roomate is listening to gospel music again.  ahhhhh!!!

      oh man, why am i still awake.  its so late, early, whatever, im tired.  joe made an amazing film.  its called "this is blue" and its probably the best thing ive ever seen him do.  i dont know if maybe his loss of a love inspired him or not but all i know is that its brilliant,  you should definetely ask him to check it out.  i love joe maxwell, i feel so bad about what happened so im trying to give him some extra support and a shoulder to cry on.  not that he is actually crying or anything.  anyway, we hung out for a while today and it was fun.

      oh poor poor joe.  i know i made fun of him about it, but that sucks.  and its a hard way to find out.  poor guy.    old navy was fun tonight.  i actually like working there.  i know its only my second day but i had a pretty good time.  i really like working in the fitting room.  today a girl came in and asked me my opinion on some things and we picked out an outfit for her.  it was so much fun.  so tonight i learned a couple secrets about old navy that i am going to share.    1. if you are intimatated by the headsets the employees wear you should be.  they are talking about you.  2. if you ask an employee if there is another size of a piece of clothing and they tell you no, they are probably lying and just lazy.  but dont worry i am trying hard to put a stop this.  ill do my best.

      yeah, so i guess joe answered the question as to what is going on between us.  i'd say about the same thing thats been going on with us always, a crazy thing called friendship.  but maggie and i have already talked about this in depth so everything should be cleared up with her.    i saw wilco yesterday.  it was awesome.  i just love wilco.  i love them a lot.  they are a damn fine band.  my friend ken came down to visit so he could see them.  i love it when people come to visit.  then you get to make all sorts of excuses to do things since they are here.  like spending money you don't have because "ken's down for the weekend"  i love tricking myself into doing things im not supposed to.  im really good at it.  oh my god its 3:50am.

      so i got this little recipe organizer.  its like a box with hinges that you put your recipe cards in.  and you organize it acording to what kind of meal it is.  like if its desert or appetizer or salad.  its awesome.  anyway i only have like 10 recipes so im watching my 30 minute meals tape for more ideas.  i love rachel ray.  shes the host of 30 minute meals.  food network is awesome.    in other news joe lives across the hall from me now.  hes my newest roomate.  he is over there right now editing.  i can hear him.  he moved in today when i was at work.  and when i got home he was here.  unfortunately he is busy right now so i can't hang out with him like i want to.  oh well we have a good 2 weeks of roomatedom ahead of us.    here are some old navy facts:  1. male maniquins wear a size medium shirt.  2. women maniquins wear an extra small size shirt.  what does that say to you?

      last night i got off work at 8pm (no jack) and came home to some pork chops that mike made.  they were good.  then me and joe and the roomates went to see bruce almighty.  it wasn't so good.  some parts were funny but most parts were not funny.  this was unfortunate.  but i knew in my heart it wouldnt be good.  then we went to dairy queen and me and joe came back to watch sex and the city.  that guy loves sex and the city.  we watched a great episode and it made me feel all lovey.  he gave me shit about my crush though, which was expected.  he kept saying stuff like "i bet you want to do that with your new boyfriend, jaaaaacccckkkk"  it was annoying.  but i punched him.  so it was okay.

      oh man helping kevin today with all that radio equipment was tough.  but i made twenty bucks and got a free dinner at quatros (the best pizza ever).    old navy was awesome tonight.  now that i have a crush work is way more interesting.  jack was working on register though so i didn't get to flirt with him too much.  but we played flip flop catch in the fitting room for a while.  then he left early which stinks.  anyway something weird happened at old navy.  i ran into p.j.  that was weird.  but it actually went okay.  he wasn't shopping at old navy (not his style)  but was walking by and saw me.  he's leaving in a week for pennsylvania to spend some time with his family and then hes off to france for the rest of the summer.  he really rubbed all that in my face while i was sitting there in my old navy shirt.  but i really saw him as the guy he is for the first time and i didn't exactly feel like i was missing out so much.    after work i came home and me and joey went out for milkshakes at steak and shake.  i love that place.  good food.  high prices.   and fuck catch 22.  i am through trying to read that book.  i've been trying to read it for so long.  its just too crazy for me.  i dont want to try anymore.  so my new roomate, mike gave me wuthering heights so thats my new book to read.  i like reading.  i gotta spend less time on the computer and more time reading.    old navy fact #14:  no matter when the store officially closes the staff can not tell you to leave.  for instance our store closes at 9pm.  at 8:45 we turn off the music and put the gate down part way.  but people still shop until they want to go.  there have been people up until 9:30 there and we can't do anything about it.  weird huh?  so if you want to stay shopping at old navy, go ahead.  they wont stop you.  they will just give you mean looks.    old navy fact #108:  if you are a skinny white girl with your fat stomach sticking out of your halter top and you are wearing white pants with "bling bling" sprayed on the back you will get made fun of by the entire staff.

      i just got home from work.  its 10:56pm.  usually i get off at 9:45 or so but tonight i stayed late talking to this totally hot guy i work with.  his name is jack.  which is a really cool name i think.  anyway we just talked for like 45 minutes in the parking lot.  he was in the flight program here and he just graduated like me.  we talked all about everything.  and he said that this weekend a bunch of people from work are going out after they get off and he invited me to come.  so im going to.  im so excited.  i mean, not just cause of jack but because maybe ill get to be friends with these people.  maybe i can wear some of my new grown up clothes.    for dinner joey made chicken quesodillas.  they were delicious, but he got mad at me because i only ate one.  but i only wanted one!  anyway they were awesome.  and im excited for pork chops tomorrow night.

      i bought a lot of new grown up clothes the other day.  it cost me a lot of money but i basically have a new wardrobe full of grown up clothes.  this is good because i used to only have tshirts and jeans.  and part of me is still kind of like 'thats all you need is tshirts and jeans"  but thats not true.  and now that maggie doesnt live here anymore i cant just go in her closet when i need to dress up.  anyway im real excited about these clothes and i cant wait until i have an oppurtunity to wear them.    yesterday was awesome.  one of my new roomates, michael anderson, made everyone beer brats.  and tonight joey maxwell is making everyone chicken quesodillas.  yummy.  unfortunately thats all joe knows how to cook so i dont know what hes going to make next time his turn comes around.  i supposed tombstone pizza which is the other thing he can cook.    i have to work tonight from 6-10.  tomorrow i get my paycheck.  im excited for that.

      today i stayed late at old navy.  i was supposed to get off at 6:30.  but i stayed until 7:15.  the managers liked that.  they got real excited that i stayed.  i feel bad about working there because they dont know that im quitting at the end of the summer.  because most people dont just take peopel for the summer.  so i just said 'ill probably be here beyond then'  and then sometime in early july i will tell them that i got an internship in the city for the fall and could they please get me a job at the chicago store.  that is my plan.  i know thats not so nice.  but thats how it goes.    i am going to the seattle film festival at some point.  im excited about that.  its part of my graduation present from my aunt.  unfortunately i know that her real motive is not for me to see some awesome films but to set me up with some rich guys that she knows out there.  that is unfortunate.  ill need some new clothes.

      so it doesn't look like i am going to get any sleep now for the second time in a row.  i just havent been able to get to bed lately.  well thats a lie.  i have been able to get to bed.  i just haven't been able to get to sleep in it.  i just lay there for hours and hours with the lights off and my eyes closed.  but i can't sleep.  i can't seem to slip into it.  so finally i got the bright idea to take a sleeping pill.  which i did about 10 minutes ago.  in fact i took two.  they are left over from my ritalin days.  back when ritalin kept me up at night and i needed something to knock me out.  i stopped taking them though because they make me feel drunk.  and i can't function.  it also gives me a very unnatural, restless, nightmarish sleep.  its fucking awful actually.  but its better than staying up all night again.  fuck joe for sleeping peacefully across the hall from me for the second night in a row.  i wish i was him.  i can't even cry myself to sleep.  i cried earlier.  but i just cried myself into more insomnia.

      joe maxwell is asleep on my bed.  he feel asleep about two hours ago.  he came in here to talk to me while i was writing an email but fell asleep about five minutes later.  i have an urge to listen to modest mouse but i dont want to wake him up because he seems to be enjoying the sleep that hes getting.  we went hiking today and i think the sun made him tired.  i know it made me tired.  plus joe isn't used to a lot of excercise i don't think.  hiking was fun.  we went to giant city state park and it was awesome like always.  i love hiking.  the we came home and joe bought hoagies for everyone cause it was his dinner night.  i love hoagies.  okay im gonna go poke joe now.

      okay so its over with jack.  the guy just sucks at kissing.  and working with him was a nightmare.  he would like always put his arm around me and it was just really weird.  it got so obvious that today i looked at the schedule and jacks hours got mysteriously switched to day shifts.  while mine remained night shifts.  so anyway i talked to him and said "its too weird dating someone from work"  which was half of the truth.  the other half truth was his lingering tongue.  yuck.  always lingering.  it still gives me chills.  so anyway work is no longer as exciting as it used to be.  except now i made a friend.  her name is theresa and she's super cool.  we talk about how dumb everyone else is.  its fun.    in other news.  i have tomrorow off.  joe and i are going hiking (the other roomates bailed) and it should be a lot of fun.  the sad news is im sick as a dog still.  im coughing like a mad man.  fortunately i found my inhaler from last time i was deathly ill and i am now using that .   tonight my roomate michael made baked ziti.  it was good.  but no one saved me any garlic bread.

      okay so tonight i went out with the work people.  but first i made dinner here at home.  i made stuffed shells and bruchetta.  it was awesome.  after that i changed and met my co-workers at pinch penny pub.  its not the coolest place ever but then most of these kids are younger than me and they dont know whats cool.  anyway jack was there and he looked decent just like i hoped.  he wasnt wearing anything dumb.  so anyway there was a band playing and they were pretty good.  and anyway we were watching the band and jack did that thing where he got behind me and put his arms around my stomach and held me.  that was really nice.  but what was extra nice was that i put my arms behind his neck and then he kissed my neck and my cheeks.  oh my goodness that was nice.  so we watched the rest of the band and he walked me to my car.  and then soemthing bad happened.  we kissed.  and it sucked.  jack is the worst kisser i have ever kissed ever.  and i dont know what to do.  he just stuck his tongue down my throat.  it was awful.  the thing is it was so great before then.  he kissed my neck so sweetly and nice like.  and then he just went crazy with the tongue.  ugh.    anyway i drove away.  now i am confused.  and sick.  i have a sinus infection.  which really sucks.  my mucus is just constantly dripping down my throat in the most awful way.  (much like jacks tongue)  so my throat hurts and my muscles ache.  its awful.  anway joe was nice enough to listen to my story when i got home and give me a back massage.  that was nice of you joe.  and it felt good to my sickly body.    i dread seeing jack tomorrow at work.

      so yeah.  well, i have a new boyfriend.  and his name is joe maxwell.  i guess i should tell the story.  i got joe's blessing so here it goes.  the night before joe left carbondale we were supposed to watch sex and the city together.  well, joe packed for so long that it was really late by the time we could start watching.  and our roomate mike was watching lord of the rings downstaris.  so we sat on joe's bed and started watching episode 7.  by episode 8 we were laying down and by episode 9 we were asleep.  (well, half asleep.)  anyway we got under the covers and slept together.  no kissing or anything.  but it was sweet.  and nice.  and well in the morning we held each other and joe asked me to come to naperville with him.  so here i am.  and life is great.

      oh man joe is totally packing up his car i am so sad.  oh well i have the weekend to mourn and then on monday i fly out to seattle.  hopefully joe isn't up too late packing we were supposed to watch sex and the city tonight.  we have four episodes to watch so he better hurry up.  crap i am so tired.  plus mike is watching a simpsons marathon downstairs.  grrrr... i need my sex and the city.    did i mention i also miss maggie.  she has been gone for like 3 weeks and im still not used to it.  no one cares about dumb stuff like she does.  she used to be interested like how my lip balm smells or how much i bought a shirt for.  oh well.  i guess the two mikes will have to do.

      well joe had some great news.  read his blog for more info.  i was really happy for him.  he deserves it.    tomorrow i have to wake up early.  i have an interview at cristaudo's bakery at 9:30am.  i hope i get the job. b ut i dont know if i will because i will have to tell them that i will only be around for the summer.  they might not like that very much. but maybe i will win them over with my charm and they will take me.  crap.  i have no charm.  anyway i have to get up early for that.  and then i have to meet my other boss for my wedding videographer job at 12:30 and then at 2 i have to work at old navy.  thats a lot of stuff.  i also have to call the doctor and make an appointment for absolutely anythign that could be wrong with me.  because my insurance runs out june 8th.  and i have to just not become sick.  i can't afford it.    i made a lot of lip balm.  for graduation i got a lip balm making kit courtesy of martha stewart.  it has a bunch of different scents and oils and i made a lot of batches of lip balm.  it was really fun.  i want to make more but i am unfortuantely running out of ingredients.    so soon i leave for the seattle film festival.  i am leaving on the 9th from st. louis.  i am so excited i can't wait to go. joe is leaving before then.  that will make the house lonely.  i guess i have two other roomates.  but i will miss joey.  oh well.  i cant wait to go to seattle. it is going to be so cool.

      today seattle aint lookin so bad.  its not bad weather.  and in about thirty minutes i will be on top of the city in the space needle enjoying a sunset dinner.  i love rich cousins.  actually i love all cousins because i only have two.  i know, i know, you probably have 20, but i only have two okay.  today was pretty cool so far.  i went to the town where they shot twin peaks.  its called northbend and its about 30 minutes away from here.  i ate breakfast in the lodge.  it was the most expensive and most delicious breakfast i have ever had.  $30 for french toast.  nothing else.  just french toast.  and $15 for hot cocoa.  mind you the hot cocoa is extremely pleasurable.  anyway that was cool.  then i took a nap.  then i talked to joe on the phone.  then i packaged up a scooter to take home to chicago with me.  yes thats right,  my own scooter.  my cousin is giving me a scooter.  tis awesome. then i bought joe a trashy present at this cool store called archie mcfees.  well its not really trashy.  but its cheap.  well gotta go. more later.

      oh man i had fun today.  i went to the aquarium.  it was great.  i saw lots of fish and some otters and seals and good stuff like that.  it was great.  it wasn't $11 worth but it was still great.  there was about 3 different field trips from some elementary schools and one high school there.  we all saw an imax movie together. it was pretty cool.  kids get so excited about anything "whoa seahorses!" "look! jellyfish!!" everything was exciting to them and so it was to me too.  after that i had some ale battered cod and chips on the seattle waterfront and saw a couple movies.  one was called "winged migration" and it was a documentary about birds.  the other one was called "yes nurse, no nurse" or " ja zuster, ni zuster" it was a austrian musical comedy about a nurse who runs a rest home.  and they get in crazy mishaps.  it was awesome.  i gave it a 5 out of a possible 5.  its the best austrian musical i've seen since "the hero of tyrol"    after that i went out to dinner with my cousin rusty and his friend.  then we came home and i showed them my documentary.  and now im gonna see if joe is still up.  although im sure he's gone to bed.  crap.  thats what happens when the time zone is all messed up. i miss him.  i never want to leave this place though.  its so much fun. i just wish joe was with me.

      so i am in seattle.  its awesome.  i am having the best time.  my cousin gave me his car (with a gps navigations system) to drive around with while he's at work and i have a platinum pass to the seattle film festival.  which means i get to get into all the movies for free and i get to skip the lines.  its amazing.  i am having so much fun.  tonight we went out to a fancy schmancy resteraunt and i had the best food ever.  then i had banana fosters for desert. yum.  after that i came home and put on my pj's and played pin ball downstairs on my cousins pin ball machine.  this is the best place of my life.  i miss joe though.  man i miss him.  i can't wait to come home.  we didn't get a lot of time alone when we were in naperville because his family was always around so im excited to come back home.  plus i gotta get back into the swing of things and start working again.  but man after being in the lap of luxory i don't know if can ever work at old navy again.

      so i got the harry potter book.  oh my god it is great.  i mean i'm only on page 23 but i love it already.  shit is going down!!  i can't beleive what's happening.   oh man i have a sore throat.  yikes.    my roomate is whistling the forest gump theme over and over and over again.  i really hate it.    okay what i really want to write about is that im going crazy!!  i miss joe!!  he has been out of contact with me for two days already.  and he said he would try his best to email me but he hasn't yet and  i i'm going nuts.  oh man please email me joey.  grrrrr....  oh well i can't be too mad.  he is in ireland after all.  that must be so amazing.  i woudln't hurry off to some internet cafe if i was in ireland either.

      oh man i just read about five of maggie's blogs i never read before.  they are so funny.  i stopped checking her page a while ago because she hadn't updated in forever but now it looks like shes back on updating so i will have to check it out more often.    if you want to read maggie's blog check out her link over there   in sadder news.  joey left today.  he took me out to breakfast at mcdonalds (you gotta try the new mcgriddles they are amazing)  and then we watched the project he was editing.  which was pretty damn good.  then i fell asleep for an hour or two while he packed and then i took him out to lunch.  it was a great day.  but it was sad to see him go.  the good news is i will be seeing him in a matter of weeks.  today was also the start of my summer work out plan.  i am taking hold of my body with my roomate katz (well he's taking hold of his own body, not mine) today we went to the rec center and worked out on some serious machines.  it was awesome.  there were a lot of huge guys there though and i was pretty intimidated.  but it all worked out well in the end.  i think.

      joey is leaving tomorrow.  that really stinks.  we really havent had very much time to actually develop a relationship yet.  the last two days since i have been back in carbondale have been great though.  but joe has just been working non-stop and i don't see him nearly as much as i would like to.  right now he is sleeping in my room.  he just goes to sleep at 4am and gets up at 9am everyday.  and tomorrow he's getting up at 7:50am to take me out to breakfast.  (which is really nice of him)  anyway he leaves tomorrow and i wont see him again until 4th of july weekend.  we are going down to charlotte, nc to visit my relatives.  i hope joe has fun in ireland and everywhere but i will just miss him so much.    in other news im thinking about selling my car.

      so today i went to six flags with a bunch of old navy people.  it was pretty fun.  we took a big bus out there.  (of course some people had to stay at the store and actually work) anyway it was a great day.  it was perfect weather.  hot and breezy.  we went to the amusment park part with all the roller coasters and then we went to the water park too.  i got sunburned.  i mostly hung out with jack, believe it or not.  not too many people i relaly knew went so i hung out with him most of the day.  we had a lot of fun together and he bought me dippin dots.  (i love dippin dots)  and he went in to the wave pool with me when no one else would so that was nice.  actually he was really great today and i liked hanging out with him.  he even sat with me on a bench for 20 minutes after i got nausious on the batman ride.    anyway my shoulders are killing me because of the sunburn.  luckily my skin is so dark that it will just turn into a tan isntead of a peely awful thing.  anyway that was my day.  i hope yours was as fun.

      today was really weird.  i went to the rec center as i often do and i worked out for a while.  then i went swimming and when i came out of the pool and in to the locker room i was surprized to find that everyone was naked.  thats right, all the women were just walking around naked.  it was really weird.  i felt weird wearing clothes.  but it made me really excited at the prospect of walking around naked myself.  so when i went to take my shower i just walked over there naked and then walked into the sauna naked.  where i would meet about four other naked women.  then i walked back naked and put on my clothes.  it was really great. and strangely erotic.  not like i wanted to have sex wth those women (and they werent all hot women mind you)  but it was just, i dont know, walking around naked with a lot of other naked women made me think of being naked and made me think of sex and well, i dont know.  it was crazy.  i mean i wasn't like horny in the locker room or anything.  i dont know.  anyway i thought i would just post that.

      okay so joe finally emailed me today.  phew.  i was getting worried to tell you the truth.  but now that he finally emailed me i miss him even more.  that stinks.  oh well.  he said he is having a great time and that he misses me.  so thats good.    old navy was awful today.  the grossest thing happened.  i was helping this old woman get a size for her pants and i said "what kind of pants are they"  and when she lifted up her shirt to see the label i saw her breasts.  thats right.  her disgusting, old, sagging breasts.  they were so so so gross.  oh god.  why didn't the woman wear a bra.  i mean, my god!  and she just laughed about it.  how could she laugh at a moment like that.  gross.  anyway that was my day.  i hope tomorrow is breast free.

      so i was wrong when i said that the maxwell's had been gone for five days.  at that point it ws only four.  today makes five which is even more depressing.  they dont get back for seven more days.  oh well.  im starting to be bitter about it.  its helping me get over missing him so much.    in other news i am going to six flags in a couple of days with some people from old navy.  we are taking a bus out there.  i am pretty excited to go i love roller coasters.  i have never been to the six flags in st. louis though.  i hope it is as fun as the one in chicago.

      i had the worst dream last night.  that joe cheated on me.  it was awful.  it was with a really pretty girl and it was weird.  it wasn't that he actually cheated on me, he like asked me if he could sleep with her.  he was like "c'mon i just want to have sex with her shes so hot"  it was really weird.  anyway that was what i like to call a nightmare.  anyway its been five days since i talked to him last.    in other news harry potter is the best book ever.  i am on page 98 right now.  and things are really happening.  i wont say what of course but its great.    well today i am making corened beef hash for dinner so i better get started..

      yikes i havent updated in a long time.  sorry.    well the big news is that joe is coming home tomorrow.  although i guess its not his home anymore.  anyway he is coming at long last!  im so excited.  we have plans to see a movie, go shopping and go out to dinner tomorrow night.  and then the next morning we are leaving for my cousin's house in north carolina.  man i'm excited to see my cousins.  my godson is three now and he is so damn cute.  but i wish he would stop getting older because 3 is my favorite age.    so we are going to be there from the 3rd through the 6th and then we are coming back to carbondale. it is going to be a long drive.  ten hours.  i feel bad because whenever i go on a trip i fall asleep so i know joe will ahve to drive the majority of the time.  but hopefully he wont mind too much. and i will try to stay awake.  i promise.  oh god i can't wait to see him.  oh man its driving me crazy.  i am going to hug him so much when he gets here. just you wait.

      joe talks about "real life" in his blog. he says that he can't wait for me to come up to chicago because that will feel lke "real life" and he's excited about that.  i, on the other hand, am scared as shit.  in chicago i will make about $400/ month at old navy.  rent is $316.  utilities will be about a hundred more.  and then i have groceries and fun stuff too.  and just with rent and utiliies i'm already at -$16.  this means i will have to get another job.  and i just don't want to do that.  that also means i will have to not have a lot of time to myself.  which also is not fun.  i dont know.  the good news is that there is a lot of free things to do in the city.  so i will just have to concentrate on those things for fun.  i dont know any places with free food though.  man, this is gonna be tough. this is why im so nervous.  but i know joe will help me out.  and i'll be living with maggie and kris too.  they will keep me grounded i hope.  and maybe they will take turns giving me food.  yummmmm....food.  i love food.  i think i will go eat some now while i still can.

      oh man. harry potter is kicking my ass.  it is really getting good now.  i did a smart thing which was to preserve it for as long as i could, but now its getting too good to put down.  man this  book is great.    well i better go.  joe got off line to spend time with me and then i just got online right after him.  he is leaving tomorrow morning.  i am going to miss him so much.  i love having him here to wake up to.

      today was a pretty good one.  i didn't have to work so that was good.  me and joe woke up at 10am and i just watched tv and stayed in my pj's until 3pm.  i sent out change of address cards to everyone i knew.  cause i am moving out of here pretty soon.  im excited about that.  its almost time to start packing.  yikes!  i am going to get boxes from old navy.  that will be fun. i like packing.  i like organizing things in different boxes and putting labels on everything.  what i hate is unpacking.  i hate it sooo much.  i lived out of a suitcase all last summer because i never unpacked.  i am so lazy about that.    anyway joe is leaving thursday so that is sad.  and he has to work so much while he's here so i am not able to spend time with him like i wanted.  but its okay.  i am still so glad he's here.  its so nice to wake up to him.  i wrote him a song it goes like this:  i can't believe i ever made you cry but i know that i might do it again and i'm sorry  and i never saw you and thought you were the best like a fairy tale but it turns out that you really are the best for me and i know that now  [chorus]  and if you ever left me i'd probably get over it in time but it would take a long time so would you stay with me sweet boy.  i wonder what you'll look like when you're old.  i hope that you are wrinkly and fat and happy.  and i know you think my memory is bad and it really is but i know i've had the best times of my life with you cause i remember that  [chorus]  i know theres things about me you dont like but theres things about you i dont like too believe me  but i've never felt so helplessly in love with anyone and i've never felt as home as when i'm in your arms and thats the truth  [chorus]  and if you ever left me, i'd be happy just to know you once were mine but that could take a long time so would you stay with me sweet boy.  thats the song.  tell me what you think if you talk to me.  its special to me.  almost too special to let anyone hear.

      i had a lot of fun with joe in north carolina.  i looove my cousins and i looooove joe.  the drive there was awfullly long and so was the drive back.  the drive back seemed more fun though.  we talked a lot about god and stuff and it was nice.  joe and i sort of have the same theological views.  mine are a little less extreme than joey's.  but we still basically agree.    we saw a lot of wrecks on the highway.  a couple happened right before we got there.  wrecks are so scary.  especially on an interstate.  im glad we were safe.  joe is a safe driver.  (read: slow)    i had a bit of a breakdown on the way home, though.  i started really worrying about my future and jobs and money and everything.  its so scary.  i just don't know how people do it.  i get depressed and worried when i think about it.  but joe took me out to pizza hut and said he would take care of me.  so that made me feel better.  and fuller.    better get to sleep.  there is a boy waiting in my bed.

      well i didn't get a manicure.  but i did get a perm.  i know, its weird.  especially for ms. straight hair mcgee.  but yeah, i got one.  i have curly hair now.  at first i really hated it but now i kind of dig it.  by the time any of my friends see it, im sure i will be completely used to it.    memphis was fun.  my mother and my brother only got on my nerves slightly.  i went shopping with my mom and she bought me tons of clothes.  that is exciting.  over all it was a great trip.  i made peach cobbler with my dad so that was really fun too.    tomorrow i am going to six flags.  it will be my second time this summer.  i am going with my friend teresa from work.  she is really cool.  we are going to go to the water park.  my mom says this will turn my newly permed hair green but im willing to take my chances.  ive had green hair before.    man someone just drove past my house real angry like.  and shouted out the window.  it sounded like they said "girls can't eat 15 pizzas!!!!"  but that doesn't seem like something to shout.    i am moving up soon.  countdown =10 days.

      countdown = 2 days  today i did something that felt weird.  i had to go to the school.  i had to go to the building where i spent four years of my life.  i had to go because joe had left some things in his film locker and he wanted me to get them out.  so i went to the place where his locker once was.  the door there which had never been locked before, was.  and in the hallway outside of that room where his locker was contained, sat the guts.  the insides of my college life.  it was awful.  machines that i had made films with, chairs that had ripped small holes in the butts of my jeans, a couch that i had slept on when i was too tired to go home.  they were all thrown together, on top of each other,  piled high like a heap of dead bodies in a ditch, like  those hallocaust films you see.  so i stood there for five minutes on top of a chair i once knew.  and i looked at the graffiti on the wall that named the local fast food joints and there adjoining phone numbers.   then i went upstairs to find someone to let me in to the locked room.  there was no one.  the doors were locked and closed and there wasn't a voice to be heard.  and the rooms i once had keys to were not mine anymore.  there was not a trace of me left.  all but a sheet of paper with some names on them posted on a door.  the top said:  Cinema Production Award - Anna Payne  and that felt good, in a way.  that i was still remembered, perhaps, by passersby.  but at the same time i wanted to rip it down and take it with me.  i left it there although i know it will be gone before the new school year starts.  it wouldn't be so hard, i dont think, if i hadn't loved every minute of school there.    so i left.  i rode my lonely bike home with an empty back pack that would have contained joe's film school history if i had been able to retrieve it.  i smiled when my house came into sight though.  i smiled because my life will start again soon.  and all my life i remember this feeling.  the feeling of leaving.  its so familiar and comforting.  it always hurts to leave.  but the beginning of a new place in my life is so exciting.  and i know that maggie will be there and joe and other people.  and thats good.  because i only have to bring the things i want with me.  and i like that.  so im smiling again.  and im happy.  because i am becoming older and thats all ive ever expected to happen.

      oh man.  today was another boring lazy day.  i woke up at noon:30.  i watched tv until 2pm.  i poured cereal and realized that we were out of milk.  but i was too lazy to go get milk from the store (and i didnt wanna spend the 3 bucks) so i just ate the cereal dry out of the bowl with a spoon and everything.  it was pretty pathetic.  after that i watched more tv.  cosby show and roseanne.  i couldnt stop.  then imanaged to take a shower at 4pm.  then i finally went out to do some errands.  which included a trip to hallmark, old navy, and kentucky fried chicken.  i ate the best kfc meal in my life.  then i came home and watched i shot andy warhol.  and thennnnn i finally packed another box.  this time it was a box of shoes.  and i finished my box of books too.  i think that is everything i did today. oh yeah i went to denny's with my friend theresa.  thats it.  god i feel like an idiot typing that out.  ugh.  tomorrow will be better.

      today i began packing.  so far i only have half a box full, but don't you worry i am just getting started.  in that half of a box, though, are two journals. both only a quarter full.  i read them both today.  one is from when i was 18 and 19 and the other is from when i was 16 and 17.  they are amazing to read.  the way i used to write, the things i did, the things that were important to me.  i was surprized by how thoughtful and mature i was at 16.  but i still just talked about boys mostly.  thats just what i talk about now, so i don't know why it would have been any different.  but it was amazing to spend an hour reading what a wrote years ago.  it was like reading someone else's life.  so im saving these journals.  most of me wants to throw them away, but i am saving them none the less.  for historic value or something maybe.  or maybe so that i can be amazed again in another four years.    i miss the boyfriend i have now.  i don't know where he is.

      man i just wrote joe an IM and he ignored me and got offline.  i wonder why.  maybe he hates me all of a sudden, maybe he didn't see my message.  most likely his computer kicked him off or something.  anyway that stunk because i wanted to talk to him.    today i had nothing to do.  i went to barnes and noble and read for about three hours.  i read a book called "alternative chicago" which is a cool book full of neat little eateries and pubs and shops in chicago that you wouldn't ordinarily know about.  then i read a book of short stories edited by one of my favorite authors nick hornby.  it had a short story in there by melissa bank who i love and helen fielding who i probably love if i had bothered to read the book instead of seen the film based off of it.    right now i am about to start a book of short stories called "pieces" edited by writer stephen chbosky (the perks of being a wallflower).  i hope it is exciting.  i have only so far read the introduction which made me very excited about the book.  i love reading introductions.  they are always so enthusiastic.    i have a sore on the roof of my mouth.  i believe it was from a very dangerous peppermint i let loose on a few days ago.  peppermints always cut up the roof of my mouth.  but i always eat them anyway.  i better go start reading now.  it is 3am after all.

      oh man.   yesterday was a great day.  i went to garden of the gods with my friend/roomate michael and my other friend/not roomate jane.  it was totally awesome.  i had a great time.  it was super hot and sweaty though and im no good with those feelings.  so i whined a little.  i feel bad about that because no one likes whining, but well, i did it.    today i have nothing to do.  i was going to go swim at the spillway but my friend jane is a cop out so im sure we wont go and im tired of initiating things so screw it.  so i have nothing to do.  my plans are:  1. call joey on the phone 2. take a shower 3. go return some shoes that dont fit 4. go to the sprint store 5. go look at books at barnes and noble.   6. don't buy coffee at barnes and noble because it is too expensive and i dont need it! 7. thats all i got so far.  anyway i better get on with my day.  i hope its as great as predicted.

      i am waiting for my friend sarah to come over.  we are going to move some mattresses today.  this is great news for me because getting my new bed means that i will really be able to straighten out my room.  and straightening out my room might mean that i really feel home here and that is something i desperately need.  i don't know why this move is so hard for me.  i have been moving all my life and i though that i'd gotten used to it.  i look forward to moving now and starting soemthing different.  but this has been hard.    i really miss carbondale.  i miss my roomate michael like crazy.  he was such a nice face to see every day.  it was so comforting to know that he was around.  he was just full of fun constantly.  i dont know anyone else like that.  i hate leaving people behind when i move.  i often think about how great it must be to live in the same place your entire life.  and how all your friends just keep adding up.  if i could take all my friends that i ever had and put them all in the same place i would be the happiest girl in the world.  but instead i have to keep starting over.  its hard.  im glad i have joe.  he is a constant right now.  and its nice to have that.   i wish my friend sarah was not leaving.  she is leaving really soon too.  and that sucks because we are just missing each other.  we are in this transition stage so i am like moving in and have to unpack and everything and she is moving out so she has to pack and everything.  anyway it blows.    well shes here now so we are going to move matresses

      im sorry i haven't been posting very much.  im pretty depressed.  i just sit around all day wishing i had cable or internet (im using maggie's) or a car.  and then after a while i start beating myself up about how lame it is that im depressed about that and how  a lot of people already dont have those things and they are doing just fine and i tell myself to shut up and go do something.  but i can't.  i just get more depressed about other things.  its awful.  i haven't done anything fun.  one thing i was looking forward to was the italian bakery across the street.  i really wanted to try some sweets from them.  the other day i had an eclair though, and it sucked.  it really sucked.  oh well.  joe says it will get better so im ready for that to happen soon.

      oh man.  i had a pretty good day today.  i went out with one of my friends who's leaving town.  shes moving to slc utah.  she's gonna be a proffesor.  weird, huh?  weird that im friends with a proffesor.    anyway today was pretty good. but about an hour ago i started getting really depressed.  it happens every once in a while.  i get too nervous about my life and i get way overwhelmed.  but as soon as i told this to joe he cheered me up in about five minutes.  it was amazing.  and now im okay.  and well, i just love that guy thats all.  i just love him.

      today i was walking in irving park with my friend ken and we saw jeff tweedy.  he's the lead singer of the band wilco.  anyway we saw him pull into a 7-11 and then we went and talked to him.  and we talked to him for like 8 minutes.  thats not even exaggerating.  if i was exaggerating i would say 10.  i would even say 10 if i was rounding up.  but im not.  im just laying it straight.  8 minutes of pure jeff tweedy action.  i would tell you all the things that he said but i dont want to relay it again today.  but it was awesome and he was totally down to earth and great and he seemed like a really nice guy.  i will tell you this.  at the 7-11 he bought diet coke and cigarettes.  and if you know wilco then you will know that he sings about that in ashes of american flags.  and thats pretty cool.

      i am at joey's house.  he's asleep on the couch and im sitting here online watching his little brother stuff his face with pistachios.  i gotta go back to the city tomorrow because i have work.  i have work at dumb stupid old navy.  my new roomate kate is moving in tomorrow and im excited about that.  it will be nice to have someone laying around the house with me.  although she will probably get a job or something.  anyway i wanna be there for her tomorrow when she moves in but there is a show here in naperville that i would also like to attend.  im torn.  i guess i will decide.  or maybe ill see what she is doing.  i dont wanna be a jerk and not be there the first day she moves in.  everyone was there for me when i moved in.  oh well.  i'll see i guess.    tonight i saw freddy vs jason.  i wasn't scared.  i thought i would be because i get scared at most anything that is intended to be scary.  but i guess this didn't intend too hard.  it was fun though.  and joe took me out so that was nice.    i gotta go keep joe company.

      me and joe are okay again in case you were wondering.  i mean, i guess we were always okay.  but anyway.  it was our first real fight and it was scary.  so im glad its over.    i am so excited for his new job.  joe really wanted it. and now he has it.  its great when that happens.  i think it will be a great job.  but he will have to work constantly and i will hardly see him.  so that stinks.  plus he is going away for his birthday.  so that stinks too.  but he is gonna have so much fun so i am excited for him.    now i need a job.  i applied for a nanny position yesterday.  but i dont know if i am going to get it.  and i dont know if i want to take it.  it seems so hard and the lady wants a year commitment and i just dont know what i would be doing after a year. but it would pay a lot and thats worth it maybe.  so i dont know.  someone help me.

      joe and i had a fight tonight.  it was my fault.  it made my stomach and my throat hurt.  like someone was blowing hot air in to my empty insides.  i hated it.  i ate a lot of banana bread because i thought i could make the empty go away.  but i didnt work.  i remember this feeling and it wont dissapear until he holds me. and that might not be for a while.

      today joe took me out to pizza.  did i write about that already?  he took me to lou malnati's.  that place is amazingly good.  we also did some shooting for sam's shower.  that was fun.  but my pants are dirty.  and that is unfortunate.  tonight i go home to chicago and paint an island.  the two colors maggie and chose are mango maddness and peach butter.  they are good colors, trust me.  they will do great things for our kitchen.

      im in naperville.  i called in sick at old navy today and spent the day with joe and mike.  i hate old navy did i mention that.  im quitting as soon as possible. aka as soon as i find another job.  i absolutely hate it.  i really liked the old store but this one blows.  its totally disorganized and shitty.    i like being at joe's house.  it feels like home and thats nice.  plus his mom always makes good food.  my car was fixed today.  joe's dad fixed it.  that was so nice of him i didn't know what to do.  sometimes when people are so nice there is no way to thank them.  maybe thats not true.  i dont know.  its not like i can take him out to eat or something or pay him or something, you know.  i think i am going to get him some kind of present though but i dont know what.  it was an expensive day.  all in all i probably spent $200 for a car thats probably only worth $300.  oh well.  it works and thats great.    tonight we went on a shoot for joe's friend cliff.  it was pretty fun. cliff is a good director and it was a good shoot.  but it was cold and wet and i was bored.  its nice to be on set though, it makes me feel like i went to school for something.    tomorrow we are sleeping in late.

      i woke up at 7:30 to get to potbelly's on time.  i arrived 30 minutes early and read on a bench.  i am reading a confederacy of dunces.  its okay so far.  im only on page 60.    orientation was pretty cool.  i am going to be part of a team starting up a new store.  im excited about that.  its nice to start a store with other people i imagine.  i think everyone will bond over it and everything.  the people there seemed nice and friendly.  there was this one guy there who only spoke spanish and i wondered how everyone was going to communicate with  him.  and how he was going to talk to the customers.  but oh well.  he seemed nice too and maybe it will help me learn spanish.  tonight maggie made this awesome cake in her turbo cooker.  it was great.  i love cake.  i looooove it.  i gotta eat more tomorrow.  yum.    oh yeah tomorrow i have my interview with chicago film festival.  i guess i want the job so wish me luck.  but joe is like a total worn out robot man so i dont know if really really want it. but wish me luck anyway.  this weekend i am staying at the maxwell's residence.  i am looking forward to hanging out with joe and his little bro.  it will be nice to get out of the city for a bit.

      joe bought me "all the real girls" on dvd.  oh man that movie'll get ya.  it really will.  i remember the first time joe and i saw it, before we were dating, we drove up to st. louis and on the way back home we hardly said a word to one another.  we werent mad at each other or anything.  i dont know, i was just so struck by the film i couldnt speak.  that was the one time st. louis was good to me.  other than that, st louis sucks.  anway i watched all the real girls tonight with my new roomate kate.  it was great.  she loved it.  today i met joe downtown at his work for lunch.  we ate a potbelly's my new job. i had and italian sub and it was awesome.  joe took me out to eat which was totally sweet.  too bad he was so paranoid about touching me the whole time.  that kid is a funny one.  but he was just looking out for me, i guess.  he didn't want us dating to have any affect on if i get the job or not.  we'll see.    tomorrow is my orientation with pot belly's.  im exctited about it.  except i am not excited that it is at 9am.  yowza!

      so i got a job today.  at pot belly sandwiches.  im real excited about it.  i love food.  and i hear their oreo milkshakes are delicious.  i have orientation on thursday so i can't wait for that.  i also have an interview with the chicago film festival on friday so that would be cool if i could do both of those positions, but joe is worried.  we'll see.  i dont know why but i think it will be okay.  i just have a good feeling about it.    today was a good day. things are looking up

      tonight was awesome.  me and my roomates danced to missy elliot all night and we watched singing in the rain.  we had so much fun.  maggie choreographed this song and we all danced to it.  it was so much fun.  on a heavier note, my car broke down again today.  in irving park.  it just overheated and it sucked and it sucked.  luckily it broke down next to an auto repair place.  unluckily the guy was like "there is something very wrong with this car"  so oh well.  i think i may just not have a car anymore.  its too much trouble.  you know.    tmorrow i am hanging out in the burbs with joe's little bro.  im seeing they might be giants.  thats exciting.

      man work was great again today.  i think i might stop posting about how great work is because it is boring.  tomorrow i start at my new store on La Salle.  that will be exciting i think.    i am doing pretty good about not missing joe so much.  im busy everyday so that helps.  and my roomates are awesome so thats good too.  anyway i didnt really miss him too much until he called today.  then that ruined it and now i miss him again.  but it was worth it to hear his voice.    he seems like he's having an awesome time.  he gets to meet a million awesome people.  called errol morris, gus van zant and chloe sevigne  just to name a few.  plus he met some cool people and he is having fun fun fun.  so awesome for him.    i ate a cookie today.  it was pretty fuckin good.

      joe is leaving tomorrow.  i wont see him for a week.  its gonna be pretty tough.  but im certain it can be done.   i saw him today for all of 20 minutes.  he came over after work and we cuddled and said goodbye and everything.  it was sad to say goodbye.  but its not that long, really, a week.  im sure it will be a lot harder for me than for him.  i know when i went to seattle it was harder for joe than for me.  thats just how it goes.  if you're away on a trip you have so much going on that the days go by so quickly.    the days have been going by quite nicely for me too, actually.  work is helping a lot.  its great to have an actual schedule in my life.  i love it.  i mean waking up at 7am is hard for sure but its worth it.    well, joey, if you read this before you leave i hope you have the time of your life.  i hope you make lots of new friends and have lots of stories to tell.  i know you will.    goodnight.

      today was my first day of work!  it was great.  i worked like crazy.  it was hard and it was fast and it was stressfull.  and i had to pull my hair up in a ponytail and that gave me a headache.  and i had to wear a shirt that was two sizes too big for me.  but thats okay.  it was fun.  everyone was really nice.  and people were friendly.  i didnt feel uncomfortable or awkward at all.  and i am really good at folding sandwiches.    it turns out i am working every day this week from 9:30 to 3:30.  those arent bad hours.  that 6 hours a day and thats like how much i worked in a week at old navy. anyway potbelly was awesome  i hope it stays that way.   some more good news today was that i got a job at chicago film festival.  i am going to be a ticket taker.  i am really really excited about this because as dumb as it sounds, ive always admired the ticket takers at the chicago film festival.  they are so cool.  i hope they arent too cool for me.  anyway that will be awesome.  the only problem is that i wont be able to work at potbelly while i work at the film fest.  i hope potbelly's understands.   joe is leaving soon.  im afraid i wont be able to see him before he goes.  but he will have so much fun that its okay.

      oh man, being with joey last night was great.  it was so nice to spend time with him.  i missed that guy so much and i didn't even know it.  i wish i spent more time with him though.  i only got to see him for not very long.  but i suppose i will be seeing a lot of him this weekend cause im  helping him move in.  and im taking another trip to naperville.  and hopefully i will get to do my laundry.  joe's mom is so nice. i haven't had a do my laundry at a laundromat at all since ive been here.    tonight i saw the movie matchstick men.  with nicky cage.  it doesnt come out until the 12th so i'll have to wait a while to talk to anyone about it.  but i would be interested to know what everyone thinks.  i do reccomend seeing it.  and i also recomend seeing it for free a week before it comes out.  but i dont konw if thats possible. you probably dont have the joe maxwell hookup like i do.

      best day of my life is today.   i found out that my film is being screened in new york city.  thats right, new york city.  at the coolest idependent theater there.  and i am going to fly up for the showing.  i dont know when it is, but i do know that its happening and that is a good thing.  i can't wait.  it blows my mind just typing this and i dont know what to do.  beyond that i also had an excellent labor day weekend.  i went down to the suburbs and hung out with joe's little brother.  and saw they might be giants.  they put on a rockin good show and i jumped up and down so much that i peed my pants.  so thats always fun.    i also had the best milkshake of my life at oberweis dairy today with my roomie and i bought a new shirt.  so life is good.  in fact life is great.  and tomrorow or the next day joe maxwell comes back.  i can't wait.  he has had a crazy good time over in colorado.  i can't wait to hear all about it.

      it is time for me to make a formal annoucement.  it may shock a few people, and some people may feel betrayed.  and they should.  i have been lying to you all for several months now.  and its time to come clean...  my favorite color has changed.  it is no longer blue.  it is now officially orange.  there i said it.  i've been in denial for at least a year.  maybe two years.  i don't know.  but i'm glad i can come to terms with it now.  its just a brighter, happier color to me.  don't get me wrong, i still love blue.  but if i need to pick out a new toothbrush, or a game piece.  you better believe its gonna be orange.    i hope everyone can live with this.  especially joe, who i believe based our entire relationship on the fact that we both had the same favorite color.

      ugh,  today i worked from 11-8.  that is a hard day.  too much stuff going on.  too much standing.  too much dish washing.  my hands got all wrinkly and gross from being in soapy water too long.  tomorrow i have another day like today and another one the day after that.  yikesies is what i say.  i can do it though.  i certainly can do it.    tonight when i got home i was so tired.  joe wanted to hang out so i went over there for like ten minutes and then we went to the video store and then i had to go home because i was too exhausted.  poor joey.  poor me.  its bad news bears, thats for sure.  i'll get used to it i suppose, right?  you know what i was thinking.  i dont think enough.  i know a couple adolescents, and those kids think about stuff all the time.  and when i was 16 i thought about stuff all the time.  like deep things, like life and humanity and god and ethics and everything.  and i miss that, kind of.  i just stopped at some point.  i just stopped caring.  i guess.  i dont know.  even when i start to think about something important now i stop myself, and i think "i can't think about that, its too much, i gotta go check my email and go to work" or something of the sort.  thats stupid.  thats whats wrong with adults, they just decide they feel a way about an issue and then they just stop thinking about it.  well, im going to try to stop feelign that way.  its ignorant and i'm not quite ready to become ignorant yet.  i'm not quite ready to ever become ignorant.  i'm glad i caught myself.

      tonight was one of the strangest nights i had in a very long time.  too strange to really explain.  but i'll try i suppose.   i went to blue man group tonight. its a theatrical performance of sorts.  and there is a part with strobe lights that made me feel like i was on some sort of drug and i felt weird and i kind of freaked out and everything.  then i drove home and felt about five different emotions on the way to my house.  one being nausea.  although, i dont believe nausea is an emotion.   when i got home i opened a package that i had recieved from my friend sarah.  in it contained the love letters of my youth and a box of pictures.  neither of which i had seen in four years.  and so i began to dig through my old letters.  and i read things from a boy i loved when i was just 16.  and i cried.  and i just kept crying.  and i kept reading.    it is so strange to have loved someone so much.  i mean i loved this kid with every inch i had to spare.  and i have no idea what his life is now.  i knew him so well 6 years ago.  but my life is so different now.  6 years ago seems like an old film to me, like a book i read once, not like my life.  it was so real though, and so true and so meaningful.  but now i dont know him anymore, or any of the boys ive loved, or any of the best friends ive had.  i have a new life with new friends and a new love and so do they.  and i wonder if they think of me.  and i wish i could see what they were doing, and i wish i could go back to 16 for a day.  or to 10 or to 3, for godsakes.  but i can't.  and its kind of beautiful that you can't, in a way.  frustratingly beautiful.    because today the person i love the most in this world kissed me on the head and told me that he loved me.  and that only took a second.  and it only lasted a second.  and its already a memory.  and in 20 years it will still be a memory.  and thats pretty amazing if you think about it.

      hey-lo.  below me is an audio blog.  i used to do these a lot a long time ago and now they are back.    tonight me and kate saw a documentary on female circumsition.  joe came too.  it was pretty hard to see, but it was a really good film.  anyway, if you were having any doubts, female circumsition is a bad thing.

      i dont know what i did to my skin, but my skin just decided to fight back.  it does this every once in a while.  so its fighting back by giving me three new things to deal with:  1.  "the ol' eye disease" - i guess its not really a disease, but thats what i call it.  what happens is that my eye lids start getting itchy and bumpy and if i don't treat it they will also begin to seep puss from the tear ducts and i won't be able to open them when i wake up in the morning.  yeah, awesome.  2.  "rashy behind the ears" - this is a new one.  i dont know what happened behind my ears but something went down.  and now i have a rash.  which has crept from just behind the ears onto down along the sides of my neck.  now, i am allergic to metal, as many of you might already know, but i can't think of any metal that has been behind my ears.  the only guess i have is that when i work at the cash register at potbelly's i touch my ears after touching the change.  i dont know.    3.  "ultra-sensitive upper lip" - don't ask me but my upper lip can't handle anything these days.  its sore as the funk and stingy sometimes.  why!  who did something to my lip.  what did it go through to make it so damn sensitive all of a sudden!  i don't get it!   anyway, thanks a lot skin.

      i really had quite a lovely day today.  and quite a lovely weekend at that.  yesterday, being saturday, i had the pleasure of going to the field museum with maggie.  the night before we had about 7 adventures planned but we only ended up doing two of them.  but they were great.  we tricked the gap into giving me 30% off my new clothes and we danced the salsa, went on a nature walk, saw some mummies and learned about africa at the field museum.  it was pretty great.  that night kate and i went out to a bar in bucktown with our animator friend jim.  who is a weird guy with weirder hair.    today after church, i spent time with joe.  we had a really nice time.  i missed him and it was nice to be boyfriend and girlfriend.  i felt sort of in love today and it was nice.  joe bought me a smoothie at a health food resteraunt and an old asian woman told us all about the harm chemicals can do to your body and i have decided that her resteraunt is now the only one i feel completely safe eating at.  i loved her.    tomorrow is monday night football and i am excited.  i think perhaps i will be able to do my laundry.  its becoming a little too much.

      wow i havent written in my blog in so long.  i have been working my ass off for the chicago international film festival.  i am doing ticketing.  and i am working hard.  during the week its not so bad.  im working 8 hour days. from 2pm until around 10pm. but on the weekends im pulling 12-14 hours.  its tough for sure.  but its fun.  the people i work with are nice.  the costumers are some times cool.  a lot of times they are really mean though.  and that sucks.    the bad news is that im totally sick.  completely freaking sick.  i have a sinus infection.  which means that mucos drips down my throat all day.  and i can just feel it drip drip dripping.  all freaking day.  its so awful.    well im home for another hour.  and then its work time. i better make the most of it.

      aw man i gotta not work so much.  not work work either, just like stuff other than work.  like im working at potbelly, and im also working on my documentary.  so after i get home from work i work on my film until 2am.  thats too much working.  it amazes me that some people go to work and then they come home and they can do whatever they want.  that is amazing.  i have had homework all of my life and now that im out of school i am giving myself homework.  im glad because i need something to feel whole.  i couldnt go make sandwiches all day and then come home and watch tv and feel like i was leading a good life.  i have to do something that makes me feel as though i have a purpose.  and im doing it.

      so i am finished with the filmfestival.  thank goodness.  it was sooo hard.  i worked so much and i didnt really get to see very many movies.  but i did meet some cool people and i did get paid so that was cool.  in fact tomorrow i will deposit my check.   in the mean time i am back at potbellys.  working a lot and stepping on bits of ham and provolone most of the day.  its pretty depressing.  my assistant manager told me to tuck in my shirt the other day and i thought i was going to lose it.  i hate working in the food industry.  oh well.    i have decided to work more on my film.  i probably wont start production until january, but i am going to do it and i am really excited about that.  joe has been helping me a lot with that.  just be being there for me and such.  he has so much self motivation that he kind of leaves me in the dust most of the time.  so its nice of him to turn around and help me up.  metophorically, i mean.

      confirmation was fun, albeit boring.  there were so many kids it took forever.  i never got confirmed but at my communion i think there was 20 kids tops.  there was seriously 100 kids we had to sit through, plus michael went first so the good part was over real quick.  it was fun to see the bishop flirt with all the young girls though.   and creepy.  afterward we went out to fudruckers.  that place was pretty good.  the swanberg's are always taking me out they are so nice.  today i have to work at a different potbelly's than my own.  its the one near the board of trade, the place ferris bueler goes.  so i know lunch is going to be a bunch of guys in yellow jackets and stuff.  oh well.  i guess that will be different.  im leaving for nashville on wednesday night.  im  helping my friend sarah with her senior thesis.

      i forgot about daylight savings time.  i always do. that sucks because this is the good daylights savings time when you get more sleep.  and i ruined it.    yesterday me and joe went to the gap and bought clothes.  it was so great.  he looks so nice in his new clothes  i never ended up making taco soup.  i just didnt ever go shopping for the ingredients.  the good news is that maggie said she will split the ingredients with me.  because she eats so much taco soup.  this is a good thing because it is so expensive.    i saw a movie last night called "nowhere in africa" i really liked it.  it was german.  i love movies like that.  i am glad i happened upon it because i was in the mood for something like that for sure.  off to confirmation.

      so i just got back from nashville.  my friend sarah needed help on her documentary so i went down to shoot for her.  it was a pretty intense weekend.  it was nice for me to get some more shooting under my belt.  i hadn't worked with the Cannon XL-1 in a while.  and I remembered why.  I hate that camera.  it blows.  okay it doesn't completely blow,  it looks nice outdoors for sure and under nice film lights too.  but when you are shooting a verite style documentary indoors for a weekend it is no good.  ugh, it was frusterating.  but i did get some really great stuff and i think her film will look pretty good.  i also spent some time in carbondale on my layover to and from nashville.  it was nice.  i felt awkward at first being at the school i just left, but i got to see some old friends and i had a great time with them.  i also got to go eat at Quatros.  which is the best pizza ever.  i even had chocolate chip cheesecake.  yum.    One of my friends got a DUI this weekend.  I am usually really unsympathetic when people drink and drive and get caught, but I love my friend and I hope he makes it out okay.

      oh god birthday life is so freaking good.  i hope it never ends.  all my friends rock ass.  we went to dinner at cafe bolero.  joe arranged everything which was so nice and he bought everyone milkshakes.  plus my dinner was totally paid for.  it was great.  all my friends were around me.  i had a great birthday day.    my friend will left town wednesday morning.  it was nice to have him up here because he is my oldest friend and i havent seen him in forever.  but its always weird to hang out with your old friends and your new friends mixed together.  and with will i am constantly afraid.  but it worked out alright.  i think we had different ideas of how the visit was going to be.  i wanted to go to museums and see the city and he mostly wanted to hang out at my apartment and watch old movies.  but it was pretty fun anyway.  last night i saw "badly drawn boy"  it was a pretty good show, but i think the guy is kind of a tool.  i hate it when that happens.  i remember when i found out that jeff buckly was a tool i was pretty devastated.  and now another idol down the drain.  im glad i dont put too much into the singers, i mostly just love the songs.    i still cant wait until this weekend when i get to go to naperville for my birhtday party there.  i got a card today from a friend in naperville and it was quite possibly the best card i have ever recieved so i am excited to see the sender.  plus naperville is where all the cool kids are anyway.

      today was a good one for sure.  maggie and i went to michigan ave. all day for the lights festival they have going on.  it was great.  there was so many people down town.  there was a disney stage show that we saw and then a disney parade too!  then fireworks!  while we were waiting for the parade we had to stand around for like two hours.  while we were there we babysat about five kids.  all these little kids just started playing with us and making us lift them up to see if the parade was coming or wanting to play thumb war or rock paper sizzors.  it was great.  a little tiring, but great.  it was amazing to me that their parents just let us watch them the whole time though, i mean we could be creepy kidnappers.  but i guess neither me nor shannon are very threatening.    there were some other kids there that you could kind of tell were mean boys.  they were kind of fat and had highlights in their hair and they just plopped into the greenery there.  they toppled over bushes and picked all the berries off of the plants to throw at people.  and it made me so mad that those parents let them do that.  then one of the kids started pushing over a little tree and a man in the crowd shouted "get off the tree, kid!"  and then who i assume was the kids dad said "mind your own buisness"  and the other guy said "why dont you take control of your kid, buddy"  i was afraid they were going to get in a fight but they didn't.  and the kids kept destroying everything.  stupid parents.  they are just jerk kids grown up.    by the way if you are thinking about going to eli's cheesecake resteraunt because you read on their website that you get a free cheesecake sampler if you buy lunch, dont go!  its a lie.  instead you will wait 45-60 minutes for a table, eat overpriced not so great food and then you wont even get the freakin cheesecake samples! urrgggghhhh!!!  but we did get our pictures taken with an elf for free.

      scenes from an italian resteraunt is my favorite billy joel song too.  its a damn good one.  its like three songs in one, really.  and how can that be bad?  birthday life is over.  i know you are probably sick of hearing about it.  it certainly lasted a long time.  but it was the best ever.  and it ended  on saturday in naperville with joe's family.  joe's mom and dad are so nice.  they took me and all my friends out to red lobster then joes mom made me an ice cream cake with breyers mint chocolate chip ice cream (best flavor ever) then she bought me three presents!!!  that was sooo awesome.  then we played a bunch of games that were fun.  then i got to go see "love actually" with the coolest kid in the world.  and it was freaking awesome.  thennnn me and joe and mikey watched tv!  i loved saturday.  i have warts on my feet.  a couple of them.  they are relaly gross.  but other than that, id have to say i have pretty freakin beautiful feet.  i mean they are really nice.  so ignore the warts.  cause that part is gross, no question.

      my roomie, kate, gave me a new book to read before i left chicago.  "white oleander".  i had heard of it, of course, i had worked at barnes and noble when it was a best seller.  but for some reason it was completely unappealing to me.  and when i read the first few pages it still was.  but when i was stuck in the airport for two hours i began to read.  and now of course im totally hooked.  i stayed up until 3am reading.  and now im so tired.  and i blame it on fiction.    tonight i have to go over my dad's house.  the good news is he is the best cook in the world.  the bad news is i feel awkward and uncomfortable over there.  more later.

      memphis tennessee.   its a town i would have moved away from and never came back to if my family wasnt still here.  yuck.  i got an email from someone with the same name as me today.  she looked herself on google and found my site and my email.  that was cool.  i have done that a lot but no one ever writes me back.  so of course i didnt write this girl back either.  she's probably nuts.  just kidding.   i got my hair a "body wave" again.  i have a suspicion that this is bad for my hair and/or scalp.  this suspicion is spawned from a red blotchy hurty spot where my hair meets my forehead.  i think i got a chemical burn ladies and gentlemen.  and im not taking it lightly.  this is the last time i get anything chemically done to my hair.  its not good i dont think and my hair isnt soft like it used to be. its starchy and smells weird.  so let everyone know that this is the last time.  and in six months when i want another one please tell me no.  if i want a change i can shave my head like i did years ago.  maybe then my poor damaged hair will grow anew.  by the way happy thanksgiving.

      my mother is funny.  sometimes i will be talking to her on the phone.  and we will be having a really in depth conversation about her life or something and then at some point she'll ask me to call her back because shes been in a grocery store and now she has to check out.    today i went to the library with my dutiful research assistant, steff.  we found out a lot of stuff about cuba and i think things are moving along now.  the library people sure dont want you to get a library card if your not from the city though.  they need two proofs of address and they are serious.  so i wasn't able to check anything out but maybe next time.  either way it was great day because steff and me went to the breakfast club and i had an omelette that was delicious.  it was avocado and creem cheese.  oh lord.

      okay tomorrow i am coming home.  to chicago that is.  i miss it.  thats where my home is, with my friends in chicago illinois.  how strange that i feel more comfortable with friends i met in college and in a city ive lived in for less than three months than with people ive known my entire life.    but leaving here does feel like coming home.  and i cant wait to do it.    i went gambling with my mom and her boyfriend last night.  it was the first time i ever stepped into a casino.  it was weird and there was old people everywhere in sweat suits.  but there were some normal people it seemed.  my mom gave me 60 bucks to play with.  i played black jack.  and i was good!  at one point i was $80 over.  but i came home with $65 over what i started with.  thats pretty good.  i doubled my money.  plus i got a free meal at the shitty buffet.  and i could have gotten free drinks if i wanted to. so basically i got to play cards for a couple hours, i got a free dinner, free drinks, and i got a free $65.  it was fun!  my grandmother lost like $400 though, so its not fun everytime.

      you reach a point when you realize your parents are people.  just people.  i realized this about four years ago when they decided to get a divorce.  and i have been slowly uncovering more of their "peopleness" ever since.  my parents got married so young.  my mom was only 17.  they dropped out of high school and my dad joined the army.  they were just two young kids that decided to get married and have three other kids.  i am just a result of that decision.  its weird.  and its hard.  its hard to have been taken care of by people for your whole life and realize that they need to be taken care of themselves.  and realize that you are way more together than they are.  and realize that its not that they dont want to help you sell your beat up car and get a new  one.  its because they dont know how.  that scares me. it makes me feel like more of an adult than ever.  and i'm not really ready for that.

      i just got off the subway.  its strange in there.  people expanded with coats and bags.  like those huddled masses ive heard about.  a rolling purgatory.  a waiting room.  sitting in silence eager to be called.  "doors open on the right in the direction of travel".  and out you go.

      i totally got that job!  they called me today and offered it to me.  im so excited!  they seemed really happy with hiring me.  its gonna be great.  im a little scared though because its a lot of work and its going to be a little intimidating being in front of a bunch of inner city high school kids.  and its in a really bad part of town so im a little worried about that.  well, a lot worried actually. but i'll be okay right?  and if i get killed at least ill get killed doing something noble.  right?  besides that, i officially went ice skating for the first time last night.  with my roomies and my awesome boyfriend joe.  it was fun. i fell down twice, but it was okay because i had a lot of padding.  and padding helped the fall not hurt as much.  i hope i can go again because it rocks.  and its only five bucks.  which aint bad, sister.

      my roomates fish died.  she was sad.  i am sad too.  its dead body is in the freezer now.  this is all very sad.    joey left today.  i wont see him until the 27th when i get back from north carolina.  i am sad that i wont see him.  but its nice to have a break from him sometimes because it makes us miss each other and thats nice.  i can't wait to go see my family though.  i miss them so much.  im dying to see everyone.  oh man.  i hope everyone likes there presents.  and i hope i get a million presents!  i  mostly can't wait to see my godson, nick.   he is three and he is my favorite kid in the whole world.    this is great because all my friends are coming up for christmas and a bunch of people are goin to stop by in chicago to visit me.  that will be awesomely awesome.   gotta go ice skating!

      i really screwed up by going to see lord of the rings last night.  oh man.  it was good, dont get me wrong.  but it screwed my sleeping up real good.  i called in to work and didnt go in at all.  i slept until two and now i dont know whats going on.    tonight i went out to dinner with joe's work.  it was like a christmas dinner.  it was good and it was fun.  but i was at the end of the table where nothing could really be heard and i missed out on a lot of the conversation.  it was kind of weird too.  there were a lot of silences.  its strange to have a table of eight be silent.  and the silence always ends with something like "so, mark, what are your plans for the hollidays"  but it was cool and it was nice to feel grown up.  and it was nice to eat free food with lots of protein and everything.  yum calamari.

      tonight i am going to the suburbs to watch lord of the rings.  i am going with my boyfriend.  his brother.  and his best friend.  and probably another couple persons that im not really as fond of.  i am planning on being very tired the next day.  this is bad for work.  i liked it better in college or even in high school for that matter, when you could just sleep in class.  oh man sometimes that could feel so satisfying.  there really is an art to doing it.  i prefer to extend one arm in a sort of right angle position and use the nook as my pillow.  this worked much better in college where they didnt care if you slept.  and in a lecture hall you could literally just go home.  it was harder in high school where the teacher probabaly felt somewhat insulted that you were sleeping in her class.  and she would sometimes wake you up or stop the class until you noticed.  ugh.  just let me sleep!  i really cant sleep at work.  i can't even sit down.  the good news is i get off at three.  which is perfect time for a nap before i have to leave for naperville.

      wow me and joe just watched monday night football together.  that was a good game.  the eagles were acting like total a-holes so i was pretty much rooting for miami.  but i do really like donovan mcnabb.  i dont know.  i guess its good they won.  i really have no particular allegience to the dolphins.    i like watching football. i like it the most out of the other sports.  i like soccer too.  i watched the world cup last summer.  that was awesome.  i saw a game between spain and ireland.  i woke up at 6am for that game.  i hope they never play in toyko again.    my roomate kate has a computer virus.  dont trust her emails.    i am so ready to quit potbelly's.  just give me three more weeks.  three more.

      This is my second headache day in a row.  i had to sleep without sheets last night.  and then a voice awoke me from outside.  it was joey.  shouting my name.  he had forgot his keys.  luckily i heard him or he would have been outside all night.  poor boy.    my cell phone wont be working for the next week.  this is bad.  i need that thing.  hopefully i'll make do.    i was going to go the library today but im just not feeling up to it.  i was going to go to church too.  i think ill watch raising arizona instead.

      i am excited about 2004.  my boyfriend told me it was the year of the joe.  but i have a feeling it might also be the year of the anna.  things are going to change this year.  i can feel it.  im going to get some shit done.  i am going to have a lot of fun.  and i am going to do some growing up.    i just realized how nicely my age lends itself to the year.  i turned 20 in 2000 and i will turn 24 in 2004.  if anyone is wondering how old i am in the future.  just omit the zeros for the next 6 years and you'll find out.    tonight i am going out to the suburbs with joe like i do almost every weekend.  its some dude's 17th birthday party and i hear im invited.  although no one seems to be as excited as i am.  i love birthdays.

      im back.  i went to christmas and im back.  i would explain everything that happened at christmas but that would be so long.  the good news is i had a fun time.  i got to play with my rockin spoiled godson that i love and i got to pet a girrafe.  that was cool  joe picked me up from the airport with an awesome present.  a mogu its the coolest ever.  look it up online because i dont know how to link things.  but its a lifestyle in the shape of a pillow.  it rocks.  ive wanted it for a long time but i forgot i wanted it. so joey did a great job by getting it for me.  the good news is there are more presents to come!  yay!    the bad news is that poor joe is sick.  and he never gets sick poor boy.  its terrible.  so i have to go over his house and take care of him and get sick myself.  until next time.

       i have enough friends. i dont need anymore.  and if i met someone new and they were really cool and they were like "hey, lets be friends"  i probably wouldnt call them as often as i should because i dont need anymore.  because friends arent always just fun people to go to the movies with.  sometimes they are, but real friends can also be draining.    sometimes you have a rough day and you come home and your friend is there crying because they got fired or they found out their boyfriend cheated on them.  and you have to put everything you need or want on hold and take their emotion as your own.  and you have to forget about your day.  and even if youre really hungry you cant eat yet.  you have to listen, and you have to give advice, and you have to go get them medicine from jewel if they need it.  but you know they would do if for you.  they have before and they would again.  and it doesnt even matter if they would do it for you, really, because you would already do it for them anyway.    and then sometimes you can just go to the movies and have fun.  and sometimes you can ride home from the movies and not say a word to each other.  and its not because your mad or anything its just because you dont need to say anything to fill the uncomfortable silences because there just arent any that are uncomfortable anymore.  and if you have too many friends than you dont really have any.  and i know that.  so im fine, really, thanks.

      i went in to sign my contract today at my new job.  i found out that i am going to be teaching at a mostly Latino high school.  im excited about that.  Im excited about the whole thing.  i can't believe im going to teach.  im just out of college.  i dont know anything.  but im gonna teach these kids who will look up to me and ask me things.  and hopefully give me some respect.  and i am going to try and give them respect and make them feel good about what they are doing.   im scared too, though.  i get so sensitive about things.  i can come to tears if someone tells me to shutup.  or if i get embarrassed.  or if something i want to happen doesnt work out.  and im scared of working in a bad neighborhood after dark.  and im scared that these kids wont care and they will do the modern day equivalent of putting a tack on my chair.    but i think i will be alright.

      i had the worst sleep ever.  i woke up maybe 10 times to pee.  i tossed and turned.  i sweat and froze.  it was awful.  its because im sick.  i have sinus drip again.  which means that throughout my day  (and night obviously) i feel a constant drip drip drip at that back of my throat.  and that aint water dripping, my friend.  that is bonified mucus.  and its disgusting.    joe was nice enough to leave at 5 in the morning because he thought i might be more comfortable if he was gone.  (i was also probably keeping him awake as well) and i got a good two hours of sleep before i woke up again at 7:30 for no reason and couldnt go back to sleep.    today i have an "instructors meeting" for my new job.  wish me luck.

      this is my second day making a mistake with my breakfast food.  i decided that i would make an omelette with salsa, the way that joe makes them.  but it became a complete dissaster and burned the bottom of the omelette without quite cooking the top and the burn smell and taste went throughout the whole egg substance and now every bite i take tastes bad.  but i really wanted to eat eggs this morning because i think they fill you up a lot more than cereal.  and i want to stop being so hungry all day.  i hope the packers make it to the super bowl.

      my new job.  its a real one, you know.  with impact and social importance.  i almost feel i don't deserve it.    i went to the high school on thursday.  the one i will be teaching at. We set up a table, me and bob, my co-instructor, with a camera and some PSA's running on a monitor.  a lot of kids came by.  150 signed up.  and i talked to about 5 that i thought were really good kids.   we can only accept 22 into the program so next week we are doing interviews after school on wednesday and thursday.  im pretty excited.    risk again tonight.  our friend ken is addicted.

      Homeless people.  you're supposed to ignore them right?  you are supposed to walk by them with your head down.  or keep talking on your cell phone and pretend that they arent there.  if you give them money they will just spend it on booze or crack or anything but food and a better life.  right?  why should we give them money?  we work for ours, why should we let them live off of us when all they do is get high all day and shiver in the cold rattling a plastic cup?  there are shelters right?  they could go there, right?  what about the lady on randolph and lasalle that holds up the sign?  the sign that says "help, i have five children and i cannot speak english"  i would be able to ignore her more if she didnt honestly look like a ellis island immigrant from russia or something.  i would be able to ignore her better if she didnt have her six year old kid with her.  but i don't give her money.  no.  i do what i'm supposed to do.  right?

      when i was a little girl i used to have an older brother.  i dont know if you had an older brother when you were little.  if you did you would know that they were perfect.  he wasn't mean to me, either.  i don't have stories like so many younger siblings of being sat on, or beat up, or made fun of.  he was great.  he played with me, and humored me, and held my hand when we crossed the street.  when we rode in the backseat of our 1985 toyota van he used to tell me he could predict when the traffic light would change.  "ready?", he would say, "one, two, three."  and sure enough, everytime, red would turn to green and my brother, eight years my elder, would turn magic.    it wasnt until later that i learned anyone could predict the changing of the traffic lights.  and it wasnt until later that i found out my brother wasn't perfect or even better than most people.  maybe thats why it all became so dissapointing.  not that my brother is the worst person ever or anything, don't get me wrong.  you would probably really like him if you met him.  everyone likes him.  but he ruined it for me.  he put on a show for me.  and then he stopped the show.  and i wasnt ready for that.  i wasnt ready for it to end, and i wasn't ready to find out it wasn't ever real in the first place.

      Sometimes sleeping with someone else can be a nightmare.  not in a big bed, like a queen or something.  thats usually fine cause there is a lot of room.  but in my little twin sized bed that i bought for $20?  waking up usually means relief.   but sometimes its so nice.  sometimes you wake up still in each others arms, just like the movies.  and you realize you couldnt be happier.  and you never want to get out of bed.  and you keep pushing the snooze button until the last possible minute and then you push it one more time.  and your late to work, but its so worth it.

I get tired at 10:30 these days and I dont want to do anything.  maybe i'll feel differently when I get paid.

      sometimes people tell me sad stories and i cry.  i cry right then and there.  i have a thing about taking someone's emotion as my own.  if you hate that girl cause she pushed your little brother, i hate her too.  if you think that man is so nice cause he gave you a free soda, i like him too.  and if something sad is happening to you, then i'll be sad with you.  and i'll protect you.  and i'll try to make it better.    i don't know why im like that.  i am, though.

      today joe and i both had the day off.  so we went to the aquarium!  it was awesome.  joe paid my way which was really nice of him because im so poor.  we saw tons of stuff.  we saw a huge snake and some turtles and a lot of freaking fish.  we saw this one fish that ate up pebbles, sucked off all the nutrients and then spit them back out of his gills.  that was the coolest fish i ever saw.  anyway we had a really good time.  it totally wore me out though.  i was exhausted afterward.  ugh.  plus joe went the wrong way on the interstate twice!  haha.    now i am making peanut butter chocolate chip cookies and they are so delicious!

      man my weekend was lame.  i thought i was really missing out by going to the suburbs so much.  boy was i wrong.  there was nothing going on.  at least not for a girl with no money.    i guess i had fun though.  i hung out with my roomate.  we went and looked at a lot of cool stores and stuff in lincoln park.  we got free samples at the whole foods, she bought me coffee.  we put up a shelf in the kitchen and we insulated the windows in our living room.    i love going to the suburbs though, i love having a family around me. i love helping joe's mom with dinner and having breakfast made for me sunday morning.  its like all the great things about living at home, with no strings attached.  i hope we go back next weekend.

      I am not a submissive person.  Actually I dont know what type of person I am.  I suppose sometimes I'm submissive.  But not the majority of the time by any means.  But sometimes men scare me.  They scare me in the way that my Father used to scare me as a little girl. They are bigger than me and stronger, and louder.  So when they get mad I cower.  I can hardly stand up to them at all.  I cry and I curl up.    In other ways I'm dominant.  If i feel someone is trying to take advantage of me or get away with something.  In that case I do my very best to remain strong.  This is my most recent problem.  I suppose I'm not very good at compromising.  I mean i can do the standard 'okay you can rent the movie this week and I'll do it next week'  or 'okay lets eat there instead of here'  but things I believe in or that I feel strongly about I cant really bend on.  And I need to start i think.  For my new job.  I think they view me as not just strong willed, but hard headed and uncompromising.  And I am I think.   but im afraid that they won't want to hire me again next year so I need to shape up.  I feel weak for doing that.

      my friend's dad died.  thats hard.  she's a strong one, though, so i think she will be alright.  sometimes, though, when you are the strong one you dont give yourself room not to be strong and your weaker for it.  people always tell you "its okay to cry".  i hate it when people say that.  but is, i guess, okay to to cry.  when things like that happen, i never know how to act.  i always say the wrong things.  i always act a little insincere for fear of being perceived as fake.  i hope people understand that about me.  they probably don't.

      oh teaching.  its so weird.  its so great.    im so young is why.  its why they all like me, i guess.  all i have to say is "hey whats up"  or "yeah that kind of sucks"  and they respect me.  its strange.  its like my co worker the other day said "jive" or something and they all laughed at him.  but its other things too i guess.  like the fact that i dont care so much about rules or like how i lead them in interesting discussions.  but whatever, im glad my co teacher is around.  he kind of has to do all the shitty stuff like make them stay in their seat and tell them they have to go to the bathroom one at a time.    my roomie made pie tonight and its about time i do some eating

      i went to my first funeral ever this weekend.  i cried and cried.  i was sad for the family.  and i got sad when they hugged each other.  and i got sad when i sang the church songs.  and i felt guilty when i said out loud "oooh i like this one"  as if i wasn't allowed to like things that day.  i dont know.  im glad i went i hope i made some sort of difference.  joe's football game was fun.  after it we went out to a bar with his teamates and hung out.  i had one beer and joey had a coke.  we played darts and it was fun.  joe is fun to hang out with.  sometimes i forget that.  but if i wasn't dating him i would probably want to hang out with him a lot anyway.    tomorrow is my first day of school, only this time im teaching. im nervous and excited.  i think it will be good.  i wonder what i will wear.

      i have to learn so much more.  I went with joe to see a screening last night.  it was a new documentary by kartemquin films called 'the new americans'.  it was really good.  and its playing on pbs at the end of march.  and well, i love it, of course.    it depressed me though.  i got to thinking about what i was doing and what i could be doing.  and about my film and about how mediocre it is.  and about how i am just not really going anywhere.    i still have time though, right?

      my roomate hates her job.  she really does.  you can read about it in my links.  i dont know how to link stuff here.  anyway i can see why waitresses are often surly and gas station attendents are less than friendly.  but she, my roomate, can get a new job.  so she'll be okay. sometimes people cant though. sometimes if the only thing on your resume is working at the big boy then its hard to get a job doing anything else.    jobs are funny.  you know how people say "its who you know, not what you know"  its true i think.  i mean i guess you have to know something but not if your uncle knows the guy at the computer store you want to work at.  you know?  and then once you start working at the computer store maybe you'll meet someone there who will tell you about this company thats hiring or something.  its weird. things seem to work out like that.    like i got a job as a judge for this film festival.  i used to work for these people in october and they asked me if i wanted to be a judge for this thing.  so of course im doing it.  and i happen to be qualified to judge something like that.  but it doesnt matter.  they would have asked me anyway just because they know me.  its weird.  that not even something you can apply for.  you know?  all i know is im glad i know all these people.  things are really working out for me.  so i would say a good thing to do would be to get to know me.  cause im going places, people.  im going places.

      last night i shot the beginnings of a movie.  with joe.  it went really well.  im excited about it.  i think it will be good.    i got sick yesterday.  i woke up sick.  joe's house is dry or something and my sinus' are used to my humidifyer.  i think thats what happened.  regardless i can't sleep at joe's house for a while.  maybe not until it gets warm.  anyway i wish i didnt have to go to work today.  my body aches and i feel pretty terrible.  i coughed up blood and all.  and i couldnt really sleep last night.  but i have to go to work.  i have to.

      i love kraft macaroni and cheese.  it is so good.    i probably had the best valentines day in ever this weekend.  and it cost zero money.  it involved playing intermural football, going to lincoln park zoo, and eating at a really fancy resteraunt with a gift certificate i won from a contest.  it was awesome.  and me and joe had a lot of fun and we didnt even fight or anything.  plus we got to see a lot of crazy sexual mischieve at the zoo.    today i opened my first savings account.  i plan to save money.  $50 a month.  i am going to go to europe when i save up enough.  which would probably take a couple years.  i dont know who im going to go with or anything but joey and i have already been together so i think id want to go with someone else this time.  anyway, i dont know.  id figure go while im young, right?

      where is all this nervousness coming from?    thats what my roomate asked me.  the answer is i dont know.  but im nervous about everything these days.  meeting new people, going new places, experiencing new things.  i dont know.  it didnt used to be like that i dont think.  i think i used to be a lot more comfortable in situations.  i used to embrace the new and different. and now i shy away.  or maybe thats not how i used to be.  i dont know.

      this is part of kate and anna's day of fun.  that was our theme song.  we sang it all day.  we had fun.  kate got her hair cut at this place it was like $40 which is not bad i guess for a chicago hair cut. anyway her hair looks great and we met a cool lady n amed anita and she was cool and she told us about a bunch of cool places in chicago we didnt know about.  i might have a little crush on anita.  now im about to embark on the suburbs to go to a friend's birthday dinner.  i dont know if i should get him a present or not because hes more of joe's friend than mine.  but i guess i should get him a card or something.  ugh.  i get nervous about things like this.  when i dont know what is expected from me.    my best friend maggie's birthday is coming up!!!  i cant wait!

      i saw mystic river last night at discount tuesdays.  i had to race home from work to get home in time and then i had to race through my dinner to leave in time adn then i had to race to the movie theater to see it on time. but we were still 5 minutes late.  anyway i didnt like that movie.  i hated the dramatic music most of all, but there was a lot i didnt like about it. i know thats not important. tonight i watch lost and traslation for the first time.  i borrowed it from mike although i dont think he knows that.  joe said it was okay.    we are having an oscar party this sunday.  you are cordially invited.

      today i went to a birthday party for my roomates niece.  she turned 1 year old today.  and the party was weird.  it was all grown ups.  and there was dip and beer and wine and pesto.  i was expecting party hats and goodie bags.  i mean i guess being 1 means you dont have a lot of friends besides your parents but it was strange none the less.  there was like 30 people there.    i have a lot of dust in my room i noticed.  and i dont really know where dust comes from.  i know it collects and i know you are supposed to get rid of it.  and i know i hate it.  and i know there are mites that live in it.  is there a machine that gets rid of it though?  and how can i avoid it?  someone let me know.

      my roomate always goes to the thrift store and buys the coolest stuff.  i need to get involved in this process.  i dont mean the classic thrift store shirts, either.  i have plenty of shirts that say "#1 Dad" or whatever.  i certainly dont need anymore.  but my roomate is always getting these awesome sweaters and skirts and stuff.  im really missing out.  im sorry this post is dumb.  but shut up cause its how i really feel.  this shit hurts my heart.

      i had a great weekend.  today especially was really great.  me and kate went to church this morning and we both decided to give stuff up for lent.  kate is giving up pop and i am going to give up meat.  which seems easy to me for some reason but i know it will be hard.  i almost gave up milkshakes, but those are way to good to give up.  meat i can deal with i think.  after church we both worked out in our own ways.  i went to the new gym i won a membership to called crunch.  that place is too cool for school.  after that we went shopping for stuff for our oscar party.  and then we came home and took a nap.  then a bunch of people came over for our oscar party.  it was great as always, except maggie invited a really obnoxious girl over.  and she was really loud and it was annoying and joe said she smelled bad.  but all in all it was really fun.  and i think everyone had a good time.  and the winner of the night was mike who made the best cheescake i have ever had.  i definitely have to go to the dentist.

      you know when parents say they love all their kids the same?  i think thats bullshit.   im teaching now.  today we go on a field trip.  i havent been on a field trip since eighth grade.  so im excited about going.  but i dont know how good of a disciplinarian i will be.  like i dont really care if they stay in their seat on the bus or if they throw things out the windows or whatever kids do on busses.  why is it such a big deal to stay in your seat anyway?  i dont have to stay in my seat on the city bus.  rules are so lame.  i hope this field trip works out. i have a feeling it wont and the busses wont come and we wont have anything to do all day.    i hope we get to go to mcdonalds

      did i mention that we have a dog.  her name is zoey.  she is like a benji dog.  i dont know what those kind of dogs are called, but i like her.  she isnt soft, though.  she is more like mangy and rough.  but she is super nice.  the first night we had her she pooped in my room.  huge poop too.  and in multitude.  but i think she was just scared because since then she has been good to go.  and she gets so lonely when we leave and she gets so happy when we come back home.  and she's scared of everything.  poor puppy.

      sometimes dealing with people is way harder than giving in.  i mean, its so much easier to just let people have their own way sometimes.  that way you dont have to even go through with discussing it or debating things.  thats how i feel about the guy i work with.  i hate him.  i hate every lick of him.  he is nothing like me.   he is completely anal in every sense.  and hes just a pain.  and a lot of times instead of arguing i just let him win.  and i dont know if thats the right thing to do or not.  but this constant fighting is hurting my insides.

      sometimes we forget whats inside of us.  we think we can be something else.  an artist, an activist, a good lover, a loyal friend.    and then we catch ourselves retreating back to what we are.    lazy, easy, uninterested, selfish, conservative.    we think that we are slipping but maybe really we are just returning to whats already in place.  we have to fight so hard to stand for something, to watch the news, to read a book for christ's sake.  why is it our instinct just to stay at home and eat cheetos and watch blind date?  what does that mean?

      i think im making a difference.  im teaching kids.  and im not teaching them just how to edit or how to shoot.  im teaching them that they are talented.  im teaching them that they can go to college.  im teaching them to follow through with something.  im teaching them not to drop out of high school. im teaching them to respect each other.  im teaching them to watch tv differently.  im teaching them that the news doesnt always tell the truth. im teaching them that just because they're fifteen and pregnant that its no reason to stop trying and that its every reason to try harder.  im teaching them that someone cares about them.  and i do.  a lot.    and i don't get paid very much and i dont get a lot of credit at work.  but those kids love me.  and i feel so good about that.

      This morning she came in to my room for the first time in about five or six days.  she said she wanted to stop sharing milk.  sharing milk is about the last thing we had going for us.  we traded off buying a half a gallon.  and today she told me she was using a lot lately so she wanted to start buying her own.    friends can't really break up with each other or anything.  you cant say "let's just be friends".  you can't start seeing other people.  friendships just fade out.  whats good about that is that there is nothing finite about it.  you can start fading back in at any moment.  as long as its gradual no one would ever notice.  i had a dream i was getting raped.  well, i wasnt getting raped yet i was being dragged off to get raped.  and it was in my house and everything so i yelled her name.  and she was in her room listening to music and she couldnt hear me and i couldnt scream and i woke up yelling.  i have never done that before.  people always do that in movies.  wake up yelling.  but i didnt think it was real.  it is i guess.

      i think i have lost my best friend.  i feel like we aren't close anymore. it makes me wonder how close we ever really were.  we didn't have a fight.    she just comes home and says hi and goes in her room and shuts the door.  she just has other friends she sees.  she just goes to movies with other people.  because she sees me all the time. right?  she sees me.    and so i dont knock on her closed door anymore like i used to and i dont assume i'm spending time with her on the weekends anymore like i used to.  and i dont even make plans with her anymore like i used to.  because i see her all the time anyway.  right?  i see her.  and i blame her for it dying out if that what it is thats happening.  because i tried for a long time and now i see what happens when i dont. and im not mad or anything.  im just noticing.  and its a shame.    and i know i can write this here without her knowing because i know she doesnt ever take the time to read it.

      sometimes when you argue with someone you dont even want them to see it your way.  sometimes you want them to keep disagreeing with you.  i dont know why but the last thing i want to hear sometimes is "you're right" i just want to keep arguing.  id rather scream "you can never admit when your wrong!" way more than i actually want them to admit that they are wrong.  i think a lot of people are like that.  at least i hope im not the only jerk out there.

      its amazing how much your body is affected by emotion.  how when i'm jealous or angry my chest hurts and my stomach.  and i feel like i have to throw up.  and i dont know what to do about it.  there isnt any pain reliever made for that.  i dont know what to do.  thats why they say to talk about it.  thats why you are supposed to go to a shrink or whatever so your stomach doesnt hurt and you dont end up throwing up all over the place.  but i dont have a shrink.  and i wont throw up.  so ill just, i dont know, go to sleep.

      one of my greatest fears is making the wrong descision.  thats why i take so long to order.  thats why i havent started another book yet.  some descisions are fleeting but some stick with you for ever.  a lot of them do.  like where you move to.  like what job you dont quit.  like who you love.    i have been questioning a lot of descisions lately.  and lately i've been scared of everything. maybe its because i have a lot to lose.  i dont know.

      today was one emotionally exhausting.  i cried so much my eyes are in constant pain.  and every time i felt myself about to cry i tried my hardest to prevent it.  not because i wanted to shield myself from embarrassment, not because i wanted to appear strong, but because my eyes felt like big bruises and my head hurt worse with every sniffle.

      my friend died.    i havent written in a while because i didn't know what to say about it.  i felt like maybe i should write something about who he was and how it happened and all of that.  like a tribute or something.  but then i was afraid that it wouldnt be good enough and that it would be dishonoring in some way.  and then i felt like maybe i shouldn't write anything at all.  but that seemed even worse.  so i decided to write about the time greg vasich beat me at risk.    we were playing risk with a bunch of people.  six i think.  and when you play risk with six people someone is bound to get out within the first thirty minutes.  he got me out in five.  he was mad that i decided to put some of my guys in north america which he had decided he would claim as his own.  and by god he spent his entire first turn just wiping me out.  i think i got one go at the game, but with only a measly country left i couldn't do much damage and i died shortly after.   i was so upset.   i know its stupid to be upset by a board game but i was really mad.  i had to spend the rest of the night watching every one play risk without me.  urgh.  i am still mad about it.    i know thats not a great story or anything.  but i think about it a lot.  it was so surprising to me because i had never seen greg like that before ( i had also never played a board game with him before).   i didn't know he could get so competitive.  i mean, he was always so nice and everything.    i don't know.  i guess that instance means a lot to me because i got to see more greg than i would have.  and i might not have played that game with him that night.  so i might not have been able to know that he could get crazy competitive at risk.  and i'm just glad i know that about him.  because it doesn't make him less nice or anything.  it just gave him another dimension in my mind.  and after that he always seemed more real to me.  and i'm glad i got that from him before he died.  and i wish i could just tell him that.  but i can't i don't think.  so i'll tell you instead.  and maybe that's good enough.

      ugh sorry i havent written in a long time.  a lot of stuff has been happening.  but today i am leading quite a normal life so i thought i might update.  im having a day of fun with kate.  i know, it seems like we have them all the time but really its not enough.  anyway today we are going to the gap to buy kate a dress and we are going to whole foods to get free samples.    whole foods is so great.  its changed my view of every grocery store.  i mean they just leave out open boxes of cookies or packages of fresh sushi.  and then when i walk through a dominicks or a jewel i can't believe that im not eating.  anyway today is earth day so whole foods is doing some educational stuff so thats really cool.  now that im out of school its really rare that im learning so i have to take advantage of whatever comes my way.

      so i hate it when people say "oh they're just jealous"  but sometimes people are just jealous.  and it makes me sad because i wish they would be happy for me and what i was doing.  i wish they would support it.  because i am so proud and so excited and so ready for everyone to love what i love.  but then i get this jealousy and these mean comments based on nothing.  and it makes me feel so bad.

      looks like im looking forward to two weekends of carbondale fun.  im trying to get off this coming weekend to go with kate, joe and kevin and then the next weekend to go for graduation with shannon, kate, and steff.  then i will probably never go to carbondale again.  weird huh.  there would really just not be a reason to go back.  although i could go down to the film festival down there that would be a good excuse.  anyway i am certainly looking forward to some warm weather and to some quatros pizza.  speaking of warm weather my roomates and i are hosting a warm weather party the weekend of may 16th.  you should come!  im going to make southwestern layered pasta salad.  mmmmmm....

      i watched this documentary today called "the first year"  it was really good.  it was about five first time teachers and their experiences in their first year of teaching.  It really said a lot about the education system and everything and it made me think a lot.  the thing that i came away with is how crazy it is that we don't put everything we have in to education.  i mean, thats really all that matters if you think about it.  why don't people realize that the kids now will be the adults that are running everything in 20 years?  its so stupid.  but still people put tax cuts ahead of education as their priorities during election year.  and thats why all the really smart people end up being, like, i dont know, fucking dentists or some shit.

      ugh i just spent the later half of my night watching CNN and drinking root beer floats.  CNN is great and everything and thank god it exists but its depressing as hell.  our country is fucked up.  it really is.  you can't trust anyone of those people.  all these pictures of abuse from iraq.  its so disgusting.  its imperative that people pay attention though.  and no one i know really does.  my roomates and i dont sit around watching the news.  i went down to carbondale this weekend and no one mentioned anything about the war or the upcoming election.  we were all busy talking about student films and digital video.  how worthless is that?  and im to blame as well.  but im doing my best to be more aware of it.

      so that was the best weekend i have ever had.  oh man.  carbondale was good to me.  me, shannon, steff and kate traveled 12 hours to get there and back and it was totally worth it.  we saw some people graduate, went to a party, saw some films, ate quatros, threw a football around, and went swimming at the spillway.  i have a sunburn and a happy disposition to prove it.  it was so freakin awesome.  we stayed with shannon's grandmother and man wasn't she the nicest.  today ryan and sato came over for lunch and we ate casserole after casserole.  i cant believe i have to work tomorrow.  it doesnt seem right.

      I went to see the constantines tonight.  they rocked me so hard.  i forgot when i went to see them that they were so great.  and the band before them just wasnt so great and i was like "ugh, i shouldve stayed home and read'  cause i was so fuckin tired.  and then the constantines went on and i remembered how fucking good they were.  they just blow my mind.  i dont know what im doing when i watch them i close my eyes so much and look at my shoes a lot and forget that they are even playing because im so busy listening to them and then i look up at the stage and i'm like 'holy shit here they are'  oh man, does this make sense to anyone?  jesus.

      Ugh, riding your bike is hard stuff.  Joe got a new awesome bike so yesterday we rode to the video store which is usually a 20 minute operation, but yesterday lasted an hour and forty five minutes.  and it was so hard.  i had to take a lot of breaks and i was going way to slow for joe.  i thought i liked riding my bike.  but that was when riding my bike meant a leasurely peddal to a neighbors house not a sweaty trek in the dark.  ugh.  the worst part is that joe says he's gonna keep making me do it.  that guys crazy.

      Ive decided to quit my job in the fall.  I know, I know, its sort of a bad idea.  but only if you look at it in a practical sense.  I make plenty of money, I get five weeks of paid vacation a year and they pay for my insurance.  Its pretty awesome.  But the people there are crazy and i'm underappreciated.  and i'm ready to move on.  Most of you that know me know that the longest ive ever kept a job is 9 months.  I just dont like to stay places long.  So i got a lot of great experience at this job.  I'm about to have a rockin summer there teaching a class that i love and i'll take my knowledge and apply to it something else.  I also need to finish my film and start a new one.    So dont worry, mom, I know its a risk but I'm gonna do it and it will be okay.  I'm young.

                                             My Best Protege  I think my protege is the best protege ever.  First of all she is the only protege i have and futhermore, out of all the proteges I have seen that other people have had I like mine the best.  She is the best because she isn't very hard to take care of, she does whatever I want, and she is just like me but not quite as good.  Sometimes if a person has a protege that protege can require a lot of maintenance.  For instance you could have a protege that doesn't really have a lot of direction or anything and maybe you have to guide them a lot or find things for them to do.  My protege isn't like this because she can do her own things with out much help or encouragement.  Sometimes I can help her if I want to and othertimes if i dont feel like it thats cool too.  Another thing that is good about my protege is that she does whatever i want her to.  Like if i told her to do something she would probably do it and if i tell her soemthing is lame then she is like 'yeah that is lame'.  also she will buy me things if i want and she does chores for me soemtimes.  The final reason why i think my protege is the best ever because she is just like me but not as good as me.  The reason for this is because i teach her just enough stuff for her to be really awesome but i save all the super awesome stuff for myself.  For example when i taught her to swim I taught her the breast stroke and the butterfly, but i didn't teach her to hold her breath underwater or how to float.  This is a tactic that I hope she will pass down to her own protege one day.         Because of all these reasons I feel that my protege is the best protege ever.  and after reading this I hope that you agree.

      last night i went to two movies for free.  i saw Saved and 13 going on 30.  it was really really fun.  i went by myself.  i really like seeing movies by myself.  i like better than going with other people.  i really suspend my disbelieve and let myself go.  i got really emotionally involved in 13 going on 30.  i cried! twice!  something deep in my soul must have related to jennifer garner's character.  plus mark ruffalo is so freakin adorable.  today my goal is to buy a skirt.  too bad there are large pieces of hail coming down.

      tonights post goes out to Cliff who apparently reads my blog,  but whos blog i never read.  i feel bad about that somehow.   So i guess Im not going to Seattle?  I mean why wont my cousin call me and tell me!!  it sucks because im starting to get really excited about maybe going but i just dont know so i cant get too excited.  me and kate have been looking for apartments together.  I love looking for apartments but im a little apprehensive about the whole moving part.  like the physical part of moving.  i really dont want to move my couch and everything.  down one long flight of stairs and up three more flights.  that is gonna be tough.  maybe my boyfriend will help.  what do you think, boyfriend?  ps.  the new modest mouse album sounds like tom waits.

      the hotness has arrived.  i slept without socks on last night and tonight it looks like im going half naked.  i forgot that fans just blow around hot air.  ugh.  oh well its still better than winter.  i still stand by that statement.  June is a big month for me.  i found out that I might be going to the Seattle Film Festival curtisey of my awesome cousin and his friend.  My dad is coming to Chicago for the first time to visit me and is going to make some delicious food while he's here. Im going to visit my cousins in North Carolina, and if a big surge of money strikes then I may be going to Memphis to film my mom.  Yes!  goodness is June.  then when i get back it is work work work all summer.

      okay so i know i havent updated in a while and mainly its because i dont have the internet anymore in my room.  and i mean, i could do it at work but the thing is that i have a bunch of work to do there.  anyway im leaving tomorrow to go to north carolina until thursday.  and to be honest with you, i probably wont do all that much updating while im there either.  and then ill have to wait until i move in my new apartment and get the internet there.   although can i say something?  i think the internet is bad for me.  i mean these days without the internet have been a little refreshing.  its like i spend more time with kate.   we watch more tv.  we utilize the living room more and i dont spend all day in my fucking room.  i like it.  but i know i couldnt really live without the internet.  we all know that.

      so i for sure did not go to seattle.  i went to naperville instead.  that was fun.  i really wanted to go on a day trip to make up for my lost seattle time, but that didnt work out either.  good news?  joe and i discovered our most perfect sport.  golf.    i had never played before and joe taught me how.  (he's a really good teacher) and it was really great.  its perfect for us because i really love going outside but i dont really like sports so much.  and joe really like to be competitive and play hard and in other things he cant really do that with me because he's so much stronger and bigger than me.  but in GOLF he can.  cause he's really just playing against himself.  its awesome.  we had a really great time.  we went twice once yesterday and once today with joe's brother and dad.  best weekend ever.  ps.  i also had the best brunch ever at the hilton. and the fullest tummy ever.

      well im in north carolina.  today is my last day.  i am leaving tomorrow to go back to chicago.  it seems like i havent been here for very long but i am sort of ready to go home.  its nice doing nothing though, for sure.  but i need to move in to my new apartment on saturday and i need to pack or something before then.  ugh.  where am i going to get boxes from?  i kind of refuse to buy them.    i have this scab on my forearm.  its a little tiny scab.  but its very pickable.  so obviously ive been picking it.  and everytime i do a huge amound of blood comes out.  its like a small fountain, really.  and it keeps coming until i stop it with some tissue or something.  anyway its pretty great.

      okay so crazy busy time is here.  i moved.  we did that.  and now i have to start teaching my class on tuesday.  which i have to have every day planned out.  and i have these kids from 9 in the morning until 3 in the pm.  so every hour i have to like have something fun and educational for them to do.  luckily this is high school and they dont have to be entertained like elementary school kids do.  but still i want to show them cool movies, you know.  i dont want them to see boring stuff.  and then i want to discuss it afterwards.  so what i have to do is watch every movie i want to show them and then write up discussion questions for them to answer.  and then i want them to learn how to use a video camera.  and i guess i could just like photocopy the camera manual or soemthing, but i want them to ahve fun and to really learn it.  so i have to think of all these like camera games f for them to play.  and anyway its hard.  but its cool and i love it.  but its hard.   you know?  and tomorrow is my last day to plan and everything because im leaving to joe's parents house in VA this weekend.  so im crazy busy.

      so we moved into the new apartment.  its great.  oh man is it ever great.  i wake up happy.  i really love this place.  what stinks is that it also means my life is more expensive.  not that much, really, i mean its only $60 more a month for me, but that also means that now all our utilities are split between two people instead of three.  and the worst thing is that our internet doesnt work so well.  only one of us can be online at a time and that stinks.  but itll get fixed im sure.  and well, all in all this place rocks my socks.  and i love it.

      okay so i finished my first week of teaching.  now im settling into the weekend.  i love the weekend.  you know what else i like?  being fat.   not like im fat or anything, i mean, i just like having fat on my body.  enough so that my stomach is really soft and gushy and i like feeling it.   is that weird?  i like that joe has fat too.  i like to lay on his belly.  these are things i like.

      today was my first day of school.  i was so so nervous.  i think it went well though.  i think all the kids had a good time and i dont know, i think it will be okay.  maybe even great.  last night i was really nervous and this morning i was really really nervous.    i felt the same way when i was in third grade and i was holding a sleepover at my house.  i just walked around all day trying to plan things for the other girls to do.  fearing so desperately that they would be bored and want to go home.    so it went well. and VA was really fun and joe and i didnt fight or anything the whole time so thats really great.  and so at this moment life is looking okay.

      i went to movies in the park tonight with kate and steff.  it was A. awesome B. frusterating.  awesome because it was fun and me and steff played frisbee.  frusterating because all these people and their mama jama chairs sat in front of us when clearly we were sitting on a blanket and couldnt see past chairs.  I am going to call the film office or whoever runs this thing and tell them that there needs to be a section for just chair people and just blanket people so that you can see the freakin screen.  i know it seems trivial now but it aint, lady!  just wait till you have a prime viewin' spot taken away from you.  sickening, i tell you, just sickening!

      tonight we went to grant park to see 'the birds"  we were there, we ate, we had a prime viewing spot, me and steff played frisbee. (ps. we are really good) and everything was going great.  but then it started to rain.  booooo!  that stunk.  so we left.  but the good news is we had a cool cab driver.  then me and kate and steff went to dominicks and got some root beer float makings and then we rented the birds and everything was awesome.  yay!!!!  hey mary lee, did you know that we are going up to visit jenny and travel down the apple river?  did you know that?  we are on the weekend of august 13th and you have to come.  you have to.

      so my mom wants me to go home this coming weekend.  and like i want to or whatever, but its a huge pain and i would have to ask off work and everything and it would really be nice or whatever but i dont know if its worth it.  and i think the only reason i want to go down there is because my mom would pay for my hair to get cut.  and i dont want to pay for that.  is that wrong?

      i just realized that i put way too much milk in my cereal.  because i have to drink a lot of it at the end when the cereal is all gone.  and i think i could put less milk in there except that then the cereal wouldnt really have enough room to float around.  do you see my problem here?  another problem: "flake" is a pretty disgusting way to describe food.
