       i talked to someone and im pretty much over my anger and realize that you cant change the way people are, or change how they feel about you. maybe if we'd had classes together last year things would be a little different? i dont know. things have definitely changed for me though. im not sure how i feel about it...i miss knowing everything. summers kind of suck for me lol. i think itll be like having a perpetually bad summer all year round if i dont go to classical. i dont think im good at making new friends. i feel like being all like wise and look-backey today so i will. id definitely say the WORST year of my entire life was 7th grade. it sucked for like millions of reasons. but whatever then eighth grade was ok and ninth was like the best grade ever. i dont miss nathanael greene at ALL. not one little bit. i just like look back at myself during middle school and want to cry. it was so uggh. but anyways yea so im all better now. even for the stupid things i say sometimes, i still have like the best group of friends ever now. i miss that. specially now. tori called me actually to go see a movie with her and some other people but i couldnt cause i have to do stupid summer reading which i havent actually finished. or started. cough. well no ok i read 1 and half books. but yea whatever. tori and josh broke up. i dont even want to know how josh is doing. i thought about calling him and asking but then realized i didnt have his number so there went that. i feel bad about it. everyone is breaking up...i dont know what it means. well it doesnt exactly affect me but still im wondering about it. anywaysss in happier news...ummm im trying to think of the happier news....but it wont come to me. why have i been so happy the past few days??? i dont know. hmm. anyways im done i need to go talk to one of the many people im fighting with these days....isnt it weird me fighting with people? i used to keep out of it but i keep getting sucked in by people. yea alright byeeeeee.

       See, my random question in my profile only lets me put so much on it, so I'm posting my entire answer to the question here.         Q:Do you believe that forks are evolved from spoons?    A:No!!!! Spoons evolved from forks you idiot. cause see ok farmers had like that pitchfork thingie? yea ok so they thought it would be good to eat with, so they made a mini version and since it wasnt used to throw at things, they called it a fork instead of a pitchfork. and thennn they decided that it sucked for eating soup. so they made it more curvy. they called it the spork. which was a shorter name for soup fork. but they still werent satisfied. so they elminated the fork part and just made a complete round type utensil. they called it the spoon, taking the soup part from spork and combining it with the oon from moon, because the shape of it reminded them of the moon. so there you go, fork becomes spoon.

       Hi everyone. Welcome to my blogspot journal. Now, I am not a jew. nor am i a monkey. and i cant fly either, but that was probably a given. What I am is a 14 going on 15 year old girl. In other words a teenager. which is probably scarier then a flying jew monkey. Anyways, i pretty much suck at first entries so I'm just going to leave you with that information and take off. Bye!
