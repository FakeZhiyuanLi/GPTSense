      i seem to always be  crying for myself . i seem to  never cry for anyone else ... does that seem so  wrong?  maybe because all i ever do is think about  my self . cause my  whole world  is about  me . my  parents  are most of the time  on my back  and my  sister  is a  bitch . and im  tired  of being too  passive . i  cant  stand up for myself. when i do they  gang up  on me... like im the little  nerdy kid  at school and they are the  bullies  who pick on the  weak . maybe its because im the  baby  of the  family ? or maybe because now they dont have my  sister  to  rag  on cause she graduated.  life is a bitch and i will never forget that . i am always in my room  thinking ,  listening ,  hearing ,  healing , and  speaking  my  thoughts  my  dreams .  listening  to myself about these things just  calms me down . i guess cause i  am the only person   who understands me . and  i  know what people always  think  of me at  home  and  my whole family . being  ignored . even by my  grandparents  and  aunties  and  uncles . they  dont  ever  greet  me  first  second  or  third  im  always last . like when im  first  to come in at the door and they  see  me. and it seems like there  walking  torwards  me  and they just  turn  around and  greet  my  sister ,  mom , and  dad . then there is  me  i  have to  come up to them so they can  notice  me. its very  hard , even my  wrists hurts  and i didnt even  cut .also my  grandparents . they do the same to  me too . i  hate  it... people  always take me  for granted  then when i show them what i can actually do they  accept  me before even knowing ho i really am. i know that people think im  flaky, stupid, idiotic, dumb, lazy and fat, anything negative is all me . all here. the girl who'm everyone  blames  it on. cause im always  there . and today i was in so much  stress  it was pretty  noticable . but no one gave a  damn  i still had to  clean  my room,  clean  the table,  take out  the trash kinda, put  back  he trashbag,  feed  the dog,  wash  the dishes,  clean  up after kristine. and then i can  attentd  to my  own life .  tiring  and  boring  but something to do.   people always have to bring me down like what i said a again. this is the whoel thing i am going to say again but this is my whole day.   life's a bitch...  people always have to bring you down every fucking damn day. especially when your doing your best and being good. they complain and nag about how you do things wrong all the time...its like if you don t like whatever im doing why dont you do it for the rest of your damn life and ill see what the hell your doing wrong. they never stop. my parents are kind of jerks, they like to put me down when im at the highest. especially when im having the greatest day outta the whole week. telling me im stupid, and idiot, lazy, fat, good for nothing, spoiled, brat unresponsible. im not fucking perfect mom and dad. why dont you try all of that ok!  it makes me wanna do bad things to myself, beat myself up most of the time always trying to please them. they must want a perfect daughter right? since there always ragging on me and stuff.i don thtink i can ever be what you want me to be...your perfect daughter who wont make any mistake outta her whole entire life. i am truly sorry for the misconception...if you wanted a perfect daughter/son then you should've never concieved me then. the only thing i am good at is being myself... is that good enough for you. at least i am not like those other girls who fake everything, their happiness and they're pleasures.i am who i am and i will never change for you and i can never change either way. i am seriously sorry. they never leave me alone when i need it, they're like the smoke who sufficates me when i need oxygen. i always have to do so much fuckin chores while they're out living their own happy lives. when im stuck at home witha broken heart and no one to talk to. my dad even goes through my pictures when he picks em up after they're developed, looks behind me when im on the computer and when im looking at stuff, and chatting with close friends. they think im so fucking stupid well then i don t igve a damn! omg! look i know how to spell! and especially my mom. she is fake as her attitude. she is very bad at faking at being happy all the time and acting like her children are all that she wanted, no mistakes are never mad in this family acting like were all perfect. well screw all of that stuff. also, i can never have my own life without her or dad dictating me. and when i am so fucking tired they dont give a shit they still push me. and then they just watch t.v. i do want to cut myself, but i never want to go back to where i was and then start all over again. "numb" by linkin part is for this whole story. it explains a  lot and relates to everyones parent problems i guess. and get this. well i don thtink you'll care but oh well.  when i say something mean or cuss at a bitchy ass cusin who think she and he are better than everyone and my parents now that, they'll even protect them. and when im in deep shit they dont give a fuck...all they do is just watch me get punished. when i stand up for myself and when others have people who help them and win. and i do know what they think of me and you know too.i am sorry for not being your perfect daughter...when i die or kill myself hopefully not. dont pray for me cause you wont notice i was ever gone. and i cant be the person you always want me to be. and today ugh was even worse. i was getting yelled at by everyone for stupid reasons. and then i broke down crying and i was breaking down. i stayed in my room like for two hours or one. thought, tore everything off the wall, threw books, ripped drawings and sketch books, threw the chair and cryed so much. my dad found out what i was doing he kept on knowcking on the door but i kept on turning  the radio ever higher. and then i snook out closed the door and ran to the back yard. i saw him look at the room from the window i guess he was suprised. then he called me and i wanst in trouble he was just asking me if i was ok. and i sure as hell wasnt but what would you htink i would say? and i stayed in my room some more, went back outside and made a flower chain and then went back inside to clean up my mess. still pissed right now though. bye.

      as  I  lay on the  soft brown earth  I look up to the  blue sky  only to see  cotton candy floating so gracefully like a butterfly.  not to metion the  warmth  of the  sun  and the  chirping  of  birds  but the  voice  of the  boy  so  sweetly   I've heard.  soon it became  night  and I was still  lying on the ground..  wanting to  hear  your  voice  even more just to  lift me off of the ground.  you said  you'd  be there but  you never came.  but it is only that I have came to  find out  that it was  your   ghost   following me around...  cause   you    died  of a  broken heart...  and the  only one  who  broke  it was...  I
