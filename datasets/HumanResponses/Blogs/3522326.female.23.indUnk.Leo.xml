      Love means never having to say you are sorry.  (Ok,Ok, not graffiti, but still... And Love Story is one of the sweetest books ever, I think. I mean, I'm generally not interested in the mushy-mushy types, but this one is different.)

      I'm reading, or trying to read the 10th book of The Wheel of Time. I knew it couldn't last, the way the series managed to hold my interest. It was ok till maybe the 5th or 6th books, but its progressively getting worse, without too much of actual action/ substance/ whatever. But then again I don't think I'll stop reading it till I finish, or rather, till Robert Jordan finishes writing. I mean, after all, I've spent so much of time reading it so far; I can't just leave it, not without knowing what happens to Rand and the others.

      Friday night, when I was washing my face, some facewash got into my eyes. I washed it out, but I felt some irritation, which was probably because of the simple fact that I was dog tired. I went to bed, and then, I had a thought. What if I woke up blind??  I feel that it is toughest on a person when he loses something that he's lived with for all his life.   When people get to know about my hand, I tell them, I don't think about it most of the time, because it is quite normal as far as I'm concerned; I've lived with it for 18 years now, and it is a part of my life.   Going blind one fine morning, would definitely not get the same kind of reaction from me. As of this moment, I'd try to get rid of myself as soon as I possibly could. Cowardice maybe, maybe something else; but I don't think I'd be able to live with something like that...  I finally joined salsa classes, that is to say, I went there and paid up and stuff..... Classes start only next Monday; I can't wait.  Would it be possible for a head to survive without the body, as long as all required nourishment and oxygen is provided to it through some means? I think it should be possible, at least theoretically, but then my sister is not willing to debate with me... And she's a medical student...  Practically, I guess it's not possible, else, we'd have a whole lot of bodyless heads around... Creepy, to say the least...  Another excellent gallery at Pbase is  urlLink Steven's . He says he's new to photography, but he has some real amazing snaps, each one more creative than the next. I can't wait to get my A80.    Arjuna uvacha: Kim tat Brahma kim Adhyathmam, kim Karma Purushottama, Adhibhutam katham proktam, Adhidaivam kim uchyate?                                - Verse 1, Chapter 8,  Bhagvad Gita    My thoughts seem to be on a rollercoaster ride... I'm randomly picking up things... Like a radio travelling at 200m/s through the world or something...

      I'm so bored I could Die.  Now, what's so funny about that?? People have told me that it makes them laugh. I don't know.  Anyway, that is the truth. I'm so bored I could Die.  Anyway.  I started with Haroun and the Sea of Stories last evening - my first Rushdie. Somehow, I'd never imagined him to write like that. Quite funny. I likes the concept of the Moody Land, where the country behaves according to the moos of the people. If there are enough people happy, it sunny and nice weather for days (I wonder whether that can be the term used, since there are no nights; so, how would a day be defined?) together; then people would get irritable and it would be night. People would be angry and the ground would shake and tremble. Imagine living in a world like that.   And the thing about Plentymaw fish. Hilarious.   And P2C2E.   And princess Batcheat, prince Bolo, the genie Iff and the hoopoe Butt, the parliament called Chatterbox because the people of Gup love to talk so much, Khatam Shud from the land of Chup.......  A lot of Hindi/Urdu words have been used. The non Hindi speaking world is sure to get the pronunciation totally wrong.  Each line can elicit a smile. But of course, sometimes, it does get a little too much, atleast, as far as I'm concerned. But still, quite a nice book. A Fairy Tale. I'll pick up Satanic Verses next.

      Have been viewing some really beautiful photos at  urlLink PBase .  HE  introduced me to the site, because he likes photography, and puts his work up there.   Nature and abstracts interest me. I'm myself looking towards photography as a hobby. A good camera is all that is required in terms of material, along with some creativity. Both can be managed, I think.   I have shortlisted the Canon Powershot(s) A80 and G3, with a leaning towards the G3. Hopefully, should have one of these in a couple of week's time.   So far, of what I've seen at pbase, I really like  urlLink Scott Dommin's  and  urlLink Dan Dunn's  works. Beautiful. Some of them look surreal. Do such beautiful places really exist?

      Muiz Mohammed reminded me of this lecturer we had in college. Mr. Ramakrishna used to teach us Sanskrit. He was one of those extremely dramatic guys you sometimes see around., probably more suited to doing actual theatre than n teaching; and he WAS probably doing theatre for all I know. Anyways, things were at their peak in the 2nd year, when we had a lot of plays to study, Kalidasa's and such other stuff.  He used to literally act out scenes, and boy!! We had to try not to explode while controlling our laughter; most of the times, we would explode without controlling it. And the first benchers would inevitably get sprayed with saliva, because they were in direct line of fire. Somewhere along the way, we had a change of faculty, and sadly, never got to experience such histrionics again.

      We just had a fire drill. I ran, no that should read walked, down to the ground floor and outside, since, obviously, we DO NOT use the lift in such situations.  The building was evacuated in 4 minutes, but that was too long, according to the person that conducted the drill. His name's Muiz Mohammed (very  expressive  guy he was), and he also did some demos on evacuation procedures and using fire extinguishers. It was a pretty good session.  I'm only feeling bad, or rather, tired, that I had to walk up 6 floors; I'm also a little happy that even if I want to skip gym today, I atleast have the satisfaction of having had a small workout.

      My room is badly situated relative to the drawing room. I mean, there's this particular place on my bed where I can sit and literally experience vibrations when certain songs are played. Its generally loud in my room, and I'm always complaining. Most frequencies find their antinodes in my room, I guess.

      I've been having drastic mood swings, and I'm not even close to menopause.   I happened to reach this page about  urlLink Sleeping in Airports  while searching for something on Google. It is real funny in places. I wish I could try it sometime; or rather, I wish I'd be allowed to try it sometime.   I would like to just pack some stuff and go to Italy.   I'm one of those people that have terribly possessive parents. They simply cannot let me out of their sight for more than a day. This has resulted in me being very less travelled since  - I'm not allowed to go out for more than a day with friends - We rarely go out somewhere as a family, because of various reasons - Me going out somewhere alone is an absolute NO-NO  NO   I guess I can understand their feelings, but I wish they would understand mine. It drives me crazy sometimes. But then again, I wouldn't want to hurt them. A catch-22 situation, and very delicate to boot.  Anyway, we've started off with a travel club in office, and I hope to atleast do some part of what I wanna do, and maybe, my parents will realize that I'm not an irresponsible little kid anymore.  Maybe I'll get a chance to sleep in an airport.

      I sat through my first ever F1 qualifiers and grand prix this weekend. And boy!! I'm hooked. No wonder the guys are so crazy about F1. Its 110% pure adrenalin.   Besides, there was a great deal of action at the US GP. 4 of the tailenders went bang into one another at the beginning, Alonso and Ralf Schumacher crashed quite badly,  with Ralf suffering bruises and a concussion, Minardi won their first championship point, Webber had to retire after a fire, Montoya's car car problems before the formation lap forced him to use a spare car and start from a pit lane (he was later shown the black flag in the 57th lap; he was running third then) and an awesome part where Michael Schumacher went past Barichello at a corner. He won the race, as was expected by most.   So, I decided to learn more about  urlLink F1 . Some amazing facts that I just read are that drivers experience 3.5Gs or more while cornering, and can lose more than 3 kgs sweating during the course of a race and revving to over 18,000 RPM a modern Formula One engine will consume a phenomenal 650 litres of air every second, with race fuel consumption typically around the 75 l/100 km.  That was Saturday and Sunday night till 12.15.   Saturday was mostly spent at Nikki's place, what with her off to Singapore tonight and all. Had a lot of fun, but couldn't stay late as I had class at 6.  Sunday was Deepak's housewarming. And goodness!! His house was really far from the office. I was tired just sitting in the car. Came back at 2.45, went to Megsy's place by 3.15. The guys were already there. Just lazed around after a round of scrabble. I can't remember the last time that I played scrabble, it was that long ago.  Went home at 8.   That was my weekend.   Also, for the first time in my life, tried to read the Bhagvad Gita. I have this little pocket version that I got in way back in school. Tried to do the first chapter, reading the actual Sanskrit verse, and found that I actually liked it. Plan to get to a point where I can sing the whole verse without looking at the book. But I think, so far, my favorite is the 8th chapter that we used to read from in school. I know the first few verses already.  Today has been quite boring till now. Am in one of my grey moods.

      Google has set a wonderful precedent with its revolutionary 1GB mail accounts. 4 days ago, Yahoo started to offer a 100 MB account, which when compared to the 4MB previously on offer is HUGE. Now Rediff has offered a 1GB account. Only Hotmail is lagging behind, but not for long I bet, not if they want to be in the race. I still haven't got my invite for opening my account on Google, by the way. I'd signed up quite some time ago, though. I wonder why.  A looooooooooooooong, okie-dokie joke:   An ambitious software engineer finally decided to take a vacation. He booked himself on a Caribbean cruise and proceeded to have the time of his life. At least for a while. A hurricane came up unexpectedly. The ship went down and was lost instantly.   The man found himself swept up on the shores of an island with no other people, no supplies, nothing. Only bananas and coconuts.  Used to four-star hotels, this guy had no idea what to do. So, for the next four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice, longed for his old life, and fixed his gaze on the sea, hoping to spot a rescue ship.  One day, as he was lying on the beach, he spotted movement out of the corner of his eye. It was a rowboat, and in it was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen. She rowed up to him.  In disbelief, he asked her: "Where did you come from, and how did you get here?" "I rowed from the other side of the island," she said. "I landed here when my cruise ship sank."  "Amazing," the software engineer said, "I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many of you are there? You were really lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you."  "It's only me," she said, "and the rowboat didn't wash up; nothing did."  He was confused, "Then how did you get the rowboat?"  "Oh, simple," replied the woman. "I made it out of raw material that I found on the island. The oars were whittled from gum-tree branches, I wove the bottom from palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a eucalyptus tree."  "But, but, that's impossible," stuttered the man. "You had no tools or hardware - how did you manage?"  "Oh, that was no problem," the woman said. "On the south side of the island, there is a very unusual strata of exposed alluvial rock. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that to make tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. But enough of that. Where do you live?"  Sheepishly, the man confessed that he had been sleeping on the beach the whole time. "Well, let's row over to my place then," she said.  After a few minutes of rowing, she docked the boat at a small wharf. As the man looked onto shore, he nearly fell out of the boat. Before him was a stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.  While the woman tied up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man could only stare ahead, dumbstruck. As they walked into the house, she said casually, "It's not much, but I call it home. Sit down, please. Would you like to have a drink?"  "No, no, thank you," he said, still dazed. "I couldn't drink another drop of coconut juice." "It's not coconut juice," the woman replied. "I have made a still - How about a Pina Colada?"  Trying to hide his continued amazement, the software engineer accepted, and they sat down on her couch to talk. After they had exchanged their stories, the woman announced, "I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to have a shower and a shave? There is a razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom."  No longer questioning anything, the man went into the bathroom. There in the cabinet was a razor made from a bone handle. Two shells honed to a hollow-ground edge were fastened to its tip, inside a swivel mechanism.  "This woman is absolutely amazing," he mused. "What next?"  When he returned, the woman greeted him. She beckoned for him to sit down next to her. "Tell me," she began suggestively, Slithering closer to him, brushing her leg against his, "We've both been out here for a very long time. You've been lonely. There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing to do for all of these months."  She stared into his eyes.  He couldn't believe what he was hearing - this was like all of his dreams coming true in one day.  "You mean...," he replied, "I can check my e-mail from here?"     Yeah ok, that  was  a waste of server storage...

        DYK:   -Perissodactlys are odd-toed ungulates, or hoofed animals, for the uninitiated. eg: Tapir, Horse -Artiodactyls are even-toed ungulates. eg: Cow, Deer -Aardvarks are the only living member of the order Tubulidentata. -The dorsal fin (the fin on the back of the animal) in porpoises is triangular, looking more like a shark. The dorsal fin of the dolphin is shaped in a wave. Porpoises lack a rostrum or a beak. This rostrum is very prominent in dolphins. The teeth of the porpoise are spade-shaped, whereas the teeth of the dolphin are conical or cone-shaped.  -Bull giraffes forage higher in trees than cow giraffes which reduces food competition between the sexes. -The Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard are the only two species of venomous lizards. -The last animal in the dictionary is the Zyzzyva, a tropical weevil.  -A dog puts its tail between its legs when it is frightened in order to mask the personal smell given out by the scent glands beneath its tail.

      Is there something called the Alpha Female?? Considering the fact that there are millions and billions of sperms for every egg, probably not...  Let's assume that a woman starts reproducing from the age of 20, given the age we are in, and assuming that most people are sensible. She can continue doing this till she's 50. So, that's 30 child bearing years. Being very optimistic, lets say she gives birth to septuplets every time. And let's say that she's in such good health that she does it every year. So, that's 30*7=210 children. Whew. Simply impossible. Lets make that 1 child a year for 30 years. That's pretty impossible too, but still...  So, that's 30 children to the most prolific woman. And what's 30 when compared to GK's estimated 16 million??  The Alpha Female doesn't exist, atleast, not in the sense of the Alpha Male.

      Last night, I spent all my sleeping hours dreaming about... solving math problems. I was actually making up problems and devising ways to solve them without using pen and paper, which I couldn't have anyway, given the fact that I was asleep. I woke up wondering how to solve the last problem I made up.   It could have been an after-effect of looking at some math probelms in the evening, combined with the fact that I started off with the Feynman.   Have a headache.

      Just back from the gym. Went today after a 2-week hiatus; I'd forgotten how good it feels to exercise.   The weather been nice for quite some days now, or maybe I should've said gloomy - depends on your point of view and your mood. Cloudy and windy, perfect for a long drive or maybe a walk by the sea.   I just love the sea. It is the one thing that I sorely miss here. Then again, if I lived by the sea, I might not think so much about it. Doesn't that happen all the time to people?? You always want what you don't have, and almost never really care for what you have.

      Did not post anything on the weekend. I was too busy doing Nothing most of the time. Its really amazing how much of my time goes in doing Nothing.   On Saturday, I went to Crossword. My first time there and I really liked the place, so unlike the other book stores  out here. Picked up 5 books and became a member of the loyalty club rewards program. The books I picked up were:  Mark Haddon - The curious incident of the dog in the night time Salman Rushdie - Haroun and the sea of stories Ernest Hemingway - The old man and the sea Richard Feynman - Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman (finally) Joseph Heller - Catch-22 (again, finally!!)  I've been planning for the last two in the list for quite some time now, but never got around to it. Finally!!   Finished reading the Ernest Hemingway...well, almost... towards the end, I found that some pages were not there; instead, previous pages repeated. I hate it when that happens. I hate to be stopped midway when I'm reading something. Couldn't go and get it exchanged. Will call them tomorrow and get someone to get me a replacement copy, and then finish it. I liked Santiago.   Meanwhile, started with The curious incident... and I must say, I like it... so far... am on chapter 61. It is an autistic teenager boy that is writing the story, and he has a penchant for prime numbers, and so his chapters are numbered with primes. So that makes it that I'm in chapter no. 18, technically speaking. (By the way, 7919 is the 1000th prime.) He notices the teensiest things about people. And he turns on the radio full volume with the tuner between 2 stations and holds it close to his ears to cut out the outside noise when he doesn't want to hear any. Can't wait to get back to it. It won the Whitbread Book of the Year award and several children's book awards. Children's book or not, a good book is worth a read, if you ask me. I hate people who say that just because a book had been labeled children's literature, an adult should not read it.  Sunday, went out with my sister because she wanted some accessories to wear for a party next weekend. Ended up blowing a couple of hundreds on a lipstick I do not need. The way I go about it now, a single piece of lipstick should last me for about 1452 days, or till it breaks and falls to bits, whichever is earlier.   The first thing I saw when I picked up the newspaper today was that the progeny of Genghis Khan ( means "Universal Ruler") numbers about 16 million right now. History tells us that while Genghis Khan allowed his men to take whatever they wanted of the spoils of their conquests, he demanded the women be brought to him. This was continued by his legitimate sons and grandsons, and of course, by his illegitimate offspring, leading to the estimated more than 16 million descendants. This, according to scientists, makes him the most successful propagator of the male gene, the Alpha Male among men. (More about him at  urlLink Wikipedia  or  urlLink here .)  Does that mean that if Genghis Khan had not existed, we'd have had 16 million less people in this world?? (Not that that's even a spot on the current population of 6.734 billion people, but still...)  And what sort of question is that??  Nobody's perfect. I'm Nobody.

      A simple piece of poetry I read got me thinking about my school days... primary school days...  One of my clearest memories is of this lady called Miss. Nancy; she taught us Moral Science; and she was MALLU with the most amazing accent. We used to almost roll around with laughter when she talked, and get scolded real bad. But then, even as little kids, we knew that her accent was the dumps.   And another thing is this: After CET, rankings etc., I went back to school with a bunch of friends to tell the teachers about it. The headmistress's husband was there, and he told us that if we end up taking EEE or something during engg., we'd sadao-fy in hell later, without jobs and stuff. I feel like going back to him and asking him whether he would call my situation that. (Well, mebbe sometimes, but DEFINITLY not the way he meant).  And I remember my first dance on stage for the annual day. I was in upepr kindergarten, in a frock that had paper frills, and a hat, with huuuuuuuuge pinnnnnnnnnnk spots on my cheeks and sumthing like a ton of red lipstick. Ugh. I kept my lips apart all through the day. And I'm still friends with my dance partner.  I still have a couple of the Dunno books that I got every year for being the, ahem, best student. The last such prize was a  book of quotations. Surprise, surprise, I just ran a search on Dunno, and actually found a site with the books  urlLink online .  And there was this other teacher. Sweet lady she was; taught us math and science. We used to go to her house ,and she would teach us to make diwali and birthday cards.  But the most fun was when in the 7th standard, we had extended english grammar. This was handled by the headmistress, and we had a fun time discussing about noun clauses and adjective clauses. English was alwayz fun.  And the number of quizzes and painting competitions I used to go to!! I and 3 guys I used to hang out with. (Even way back then I preferred male company, just as I do now.) Any information about a competition, and our names were the first to be put forward.  Guess its fun to be a kid. The greatest of my worries was whether or not I'd come first in the next class test/exam...

      There once was a lady, Ilene, Who lived on distilled kerosene, But she started absorbin' A new hydrocarbon and since then she'd never benzene  I have decided to learn dancing. Had been to the Dance Studio last evening to enquire. I'm trying to decide between Salsa and Swing; I'm leaning towards Salsa, and I have a sneaky suspicion that that's what I'll choose in the end.   There was a young lady one fall Who wore a newspaper dress to a ball. The dress caught fire And burned her entire Front page, sporting section and all.  (These limericks are not mine. They were found  urlLink here ; they can also be found at umpteen other sites.)

      I was burning a CD last night, and while it was happening, I was idly going through whatever was written on the CD cover. It was a MoserBaer CDR and this is what was written on it - "Specially created for recording data/audio/video".  I didn't know you used a CD for anything else. Or maybe, they just happened to leave out the "just add water and cook for 5 minutes" part.

      I read a bit of news in the newspaper today... what else does a person read in the newspaper?? Well, quite a lot of junk if you ask me; and I'm not too sure that what I read cannot be classified as junk... but i digress...  A German sociologist, Werner Habermehl, fron the Univ of Hamburg says that regular sex can "help university students concentrate better, pass exams and get better grades. They found that regular sexual activity increased mental capability significantly, but said that celibate students found it harder to make the grade. As well as decreasing the length of time needed to complete a course, students with a healthy sex life also received better marks".  Damn!! Now, why didn't he do that study when it would've helped ME???  Another bit of bizarre news/junk: A german couple tried unsuccessfully for years to have a baby. Reason for being unsuccessful: They thought that lying next to each other was sufficient to make babies. They went to a doctor after the above mentioned unsuccessful so-many-years. The shocked doctor sent them into sex therapy.   Is something like this possible?? Are there really people that do not know how to, ummmmmm, procreate??  And what is it with Germans and sex??

      Quite a day today, after a late night yesterday. Have a headache to boot.  Have been compiling a list of book that I need to read, or buy, if I've already read it. I just realized that I've got to read so many more....... when will I finish reading so many of them?  Anyway, plan to start as early as possible. May be I'll go and pick up a couple of the titles on my list today, if possible.   And, most importantly, I'm back to my normal, good ole self. I haven't thought about either of the things that were bothering me these last couple of days. So, that list will have to wait...

      Last night, I got a call on my cell. This guy calls me by my first name and starts talking. I did not recognize the phone number that was displayed, but he started to talk like he's known me all his life, and he also sounded like a friend of mine, that I screamed out his name, coz i hadn't spoken to him (the friend, i mean) in ages. The conversation went something like this:  Him: En, why did you take this long to pick up the phone? Me: S, that you?? SSSSSSSSSSSSSS...... ages since i spoke to you..... Him: Hello?? Hello?? Could I speak to En please? Me: This is En dumbass....... temme.... Him: En, this is me...  (Finally, i start having doubts; this does not seem to be S)  Me: Whos' this? Him: Alok Me: Alok..... Alok who?? I dont know any Alok. Him: Alok from Intel. Me: ........  (He starts having doubts too)  Him: Am i speaking to En something-that-I-didn't-catch-but-definitely-not-my-surname Me: Sorry, wrong number. (Laugh,laugh,laugh) Him: He didn't say anything. He just hung up.  That brings me to another thing that happened 5 minutes ago.  This colleague of mine tells me that he was chatting with 2 people on IM - one, his friend, and the other, our project lead. Turned out that he was generally doing some cribbing bout work, and all that went to the wrong person, coz he was so busy typing that he didn't see which window he was wriing in.  He noticed that our lead was getting to see all that he was writing only when he realized that he wasn't getting any replies from his friend.   That got me wondering.  How would I react if I did something like that?  Worse, what if I were at the receiving end??

      I'm watching the webcast of the transit. Its real nice... Wish I could see it live, as in gaze at the sun with whatever, but it is cloudy here. I knew this would happen. Murphy's law...  No point in going to the planetarium.   Here's an  urlLink image . This one is a view from Norway.

      Today is special.   We're going to witness a spectacle that no one alive has seen. Venus is going to eclipse the sun, if you can call it that. Anyway, Venus will appear like a black dot on the face of the Sun, taking about 6 hours to travel across its diameter. This event is something that happens about 10 times a millenium, and last happened 122 years ago.   Captain Cook sailed from England to Tahiti in 1769 just so he could watch the transit of Venus across the Sun. He happened to discover Hawaii on the way.   I plan to go to the planetarium to see the event. Around noon, which will be almost the best time to view it, since Venus will be near about the center of the sun. There are lots of gray clouds hanging around in the sky. I just hope they do not take it into their minds to spoil the fun.  That reminds me of another eclipse I witnessed. This was way back in 1995, and I just checked the date, it was on October 24th. It was a total solar eclipse. It was amazing. I still remember, during the moment of totality, it was eerily dark all around, and I do not mean dark, as at night, but dark as in light but no light. It was also strangely silent, no noises of birds and insects. It was WOW.   Some details about Venus. Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It has the least eccentric orbit among the planets, and has retrograde rotation. It is known as the sister planet of earth, although the similarities end with the size, density and chemical composition. Venus is one of the brightest objects in the night sky.

      Something I was doing reminded me of something else. May 21st, on my way back home from office, I got stuck at a traffic signal. I looked up at the sky, and this is what I saw: a little something that appeared like a bulbous nose right at the tip of the crescent moon.  I'd never seen anything like that before. In fact, i was wondering whether it really was not a balloon or something. Only after going home did I realise that the bulbous nose was Venus. It was an occultation of Venus by the Moon. Anyway, I kept a watch on it till it became hazy on the horizon. A real beautiful sight.

      Back. Forgot to add something here in the morning.   My seat is on the sixth floor of my office. There's this huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge tree next to the building, and it houses a whole lot of birds and other creatures. When I came in today, the window behind me had its blinds drawn up, and there on the sill, I saw this little bird (have no idea what it was, but it was blackish brown, with yellow circles around it eyes) standing on the window sill, and bird talking to its refelction, and trying to peck at it, and getting totally frustrated. It was sooooo cute. Then later, another bird doing the same thing, only it was bigger and louder, an eagle. I think there are 4 eagles that live in the tree I was talking about; at least, I've counted 4. One of them has this huge nest, and I've seen it feeding an eaglet there. Awesome.

      A Monday. I'm early to office and thought that I'd put down a few things that are running through my mind. Or may be I should make that, NOT running through my mind.   The last week has been terrible, and that is an understatement.   First, I've been having serious thoughts about my life. Am I really doing what I want to be doing? I guess not. But the thing is I do not really know what I want........... or do I??   -- Spend all my time with animals - take care of them, love them, cuddle them........  -- Travel - This is one thing that really fascinates me. Nothing I'd love to do more than just pack some stuff and set out and go where my feeling take me. The first place would be Italy, for sure. Then, Alaska. And then, New Zealand. And then, wherever.  -- Be a book critic -  That would keep me in absolute touch with my first love. Mann, would it be great to have the world reading what I feel about books, and have them appreciate it, AND make a living out of it!! But, most important of all, it would give me an opportunity to read and read and read without anybody (read, my family) going on and on about it.  -- Open a restaurant - Mmmmmmm, Heavenly Food. And what better way to somebody's heart (Well, a whole lot of people's hearts, in this case). But no, I do not think this will work out. Everything has to be perfect, and that would be almost impossible, or atleast, it would take ages and ages......  -- Be an RJ - I LOVE to talk and talk (atleast, when I'm in the mood). And I would also consider myself quite well informed about things. That says it all.  There's more....... I'll add to this list later.  To come back, the last week has been,well, terrible. Here I was thinking about myself, and myself only, when along came this guy. He's gone now, and I don't think I'll ever see him again, but he affected me too much. Way too much. Today will probably be the lousiest I've felt in quite some time. I guess I'll get over him, but it'll take some time. But I still cannot get over the fact that he'll not be there in the next bay, right where I can see him if I just stand up. [Edit - 13th July] I'm totally over him.  June 5th, Saturday, was nice. And extremely funny at one point. The lift just opened of its own accord. We had neither called it, nor was there anybody inside it. We got the shock of our lives, jumped like a couple of frightened rabbits and then had a good laugh afterwards.  And then, I read this article in the news paper on Sunday that June is the most passionate month of the year, and I must say, I agree. [Edit] I can't believe I wrote that. It sounds so dreadfully idiotic. I'm not going to remove it though.  Be back later today.

      On my way down from lunch today, I saw a really cute and funny thing. On the roof of a nearby house, I saw a crow doing what I thought was play around with what I initially thought was a shadow. On a closer look I realized that the 'shadow' was an almost baby squirrel. I'd never seen anything like that before. I don't know whether they were playing or whether the crow was trying to catch the squirrel. (Do crows catch live squirrels and eat them?? On second thoughts, do crows play with squirrels??) I stood watching them for sometime, till the crow flew away or something like that (Truth to tell, I got a call, and after I was done, I looked back, and saw that neither crow nor squirrel was to be seen).  Missed class last night because of a dummmmmbbbbbbb call which I could well have missed without anybody being the wiser. Two (w)hole hours. I was starving by the time it was over.  Going for the first round of book distribution tomorrow. 110k is an amazing amount. We can do wonders with that.

      Last evening, I warned my pops that the guy I marry had better be like my friend.  Got a new land line day before at home. When I reached home in the evening, I got the shock of my life. There were so many people there trying to fix the line that it looked like there was a wedding on or something. They were unable to fix it that day, and had to come back the next day. My pops had pretty much set it right by the time they came in the morning.

      Just back after helping a friend buy a gift for his wife. He had a small diamond pendant in mind; I ended up taking him to an expensive place and he blew 60k on a solitaire. Wicked. Very pretty. I wouldn't mind getting something like that for my birthday myself. Spent lunch giving him tips on making the day more romantic.  He asked me what I'd like someone to give me for my birthday, and I said, anything from a bunch of roses to a fancy car. Ok, the car is probably out, because I don't know anybody that would give me a car as a birthday gift.(I'll probably have to wait till I get married, and even then, hope that my husband has the same expensive tastes that I do.) Otherwise, as far as I'm concerned, flowers, perfumes and books are good enough. Music is ok too, though the problem would be with differing tastes. Surprise birthday parties are good too.  Ok, enough about birthdays. Mine's coming up soon. I just love birthdays, esp. mine.  Spoke to the boss yesterday. He nodded his head, smiled around and waxed lyrical about stuff, as usual. Anyway, I told him whatever there was on my mind. Just hope he pays some heed to it.

      Monty is supposed to get me flowers, a dozen red roses to be exact, when I see him next month, to celebrate one year of our first talking to each other. I even decided to be generous, and told him he could make it two dozen. Gawwwddddd!! Where is that old world chivalry? Don't guys give girls flowers anymore?? Or is it just me?  I love (most) flowers. Roses feel so nice. Daisies and tulips and carnations are oh-so-happy flowers. Not orchids though, at least, not most of them. I do not particularly care for those red and yellow and other colored flowers that come from those thigh high plants with long ovalish leaves.

      Back after a long lunch. Feeling real sleepy.  We just moved from the 6th floor to the 2nd. I feel cut off from the whole world. And am missing the coffee day next door. And the views from windows. And all those eagles and other birds that used to sit on the window sill. (Now how will I take those snaps I'd imagined I'd take??) And the corridor traffic.  The Note Book Drive was a big success. We managed to collect a lot more than we expected. We should be distributing the books next weekend.  Saturday was spent studying, morning with kiddo, and evening with the class. It is nice to do combined study. Wonder why I never did it before. Learnt a lot of things that I wouldn't have if I'd been studying on my own. What the hell, I probably wouldn't have studied at all if I'd been on my own.  So many things to do, so little time to do them in.  Why does Angeethi always ALWAYS have the same buffet spread everyday??  Bored. Nothing interesting to do. Nothing interesting to post.

      Shabs was telling me her story yesterday. About how tough a time she had convincing her parents about her guy, and getting them to agree to her getting married to him. They were esp. adamant about the religion part.  Sets me wondering. Its amazing how narrow minded even highly educated people can get when it comes to religion. And it is amazing how they are ready to get you married off to somebody they've only just met after an ad in the paper or something, yet not willing to let you marry somebody that you've known for sometime. And why should they worry about the whole world?

      Last night, though I left office at the usual time, I reached class like real early. Guess it was because Shabina was not there and so, I only had to concentrate on walking and not talking. Well, I got there half an hour early, and got to see all the pros doing a dress rehearsal sorta thingy for a formal fancy show that they have today. They all looked so fabulously sexy. Guys included. And the way they danced... they weren't moving, they were flowing...   Learnt some new steps, and some spanish words (although I can't for the life of me remember what they were... The words, I mean).  Last evening I was having a discussion with Tejus: What's the best way to make money without doing any work?  After some time, we hit upon a solution: Become a  Sadhu . You get fancy cars, your own  ashram , and people touching you feet and listening to your words, as an added bonus.  Now all I need to do is find that book "Learn to be a Sadhu in 30 days".

      There was this guy on the trip that turned out to be a royal pain in the ass. He would butt in where not welcome, and chip in with his views when not wanted. And. He. Would. Not. Take. Hints.  &nbsp;  Thing is this: I was complaining about this guy to someone I met on the trip. That goes totally against my policy of not bitching about my fellow human beings.  &nbsp;  Another thing is this: A couple&nbsp;of time, I butted in on discussions that other people were having. It is quite possible that they resented me doing that.  &nbsp;  What does that make me?? Even if I attribute the first thing above to the fact that I was was realllllllly pissed off, it doesn't let me off.  &nbsp;  I guess everybody's a hypocrite when it comes to that. I'll just&nbsp;try my best not to be one.

      Oooooooooooohhh..... my poo' poo' legs..... They are not yet back to normal. That was quite a beating&nbsp;they took on Saturday.  &nbsp;  But then, who cares?? It was one of the better experiences of my life.  &nbsp;  We started about half an hour behind schedule. That threw the whole day out of schedule, and we had to come back without going to the caves. It was wonderful, nonetheless. The climb itself was wonderful. 1300 feet of&nbsp;quite-steep-and-wet-in-places&nbsp;&nbsp;rock made for some&nbsp;slippery climbing. The view&nbsp;from the top was simply fantabulous.&nbsp;Just that made&nbsp;all that effort worth it. It was the descent&nbsp;that had me a little, well, not exactly scared, but it sure got me wondering whether I would be able to do it. It turned out to be quite easy, once I got the hang of it. But even then, once, when I was busy yapping,&nbsp;I lost concentration for a second. The next thing I knew, I was&nbsp;on my butt with quite a bum(p). Thankfully, I wasn't hurt.&nbsp;I also discovered that I might have a strange affinity toward cacti. I mean, I managed to get myself scratched and bleeding at every possible&nbsp;growth of cacti, and there were&nbsp;quite a few such patches there.  &nbsp;  Reached home by 7.30, which was quite good, considering&nbsp;the fact that we started&nbsp;late, and most such plans are never almost executed according to the planned time.  &nbsp;  Also, met a lot of nice people. That had been another fear - that I'd be all alone since I did not know a  single  person in the entire group before I met them that morning.  &nbsp;  After a long time, I was absolutely myself. Its quite possible that a few people thought that my enthusiasm was&nbsp;kinda put on, but then,&nbsp;like that ad used to go ,&nbsp;I don't care . I was just being me, jabbering away to glory. That sure left me with a real sore throat at the end of the day. But like I said before, who cares??  &nbsp;  The fotos have come out real nice. That reminds me... I'm unable to post snaps here.

       Hey, Blogger's changed, much more user friendly now.....  &nbsp;  Feeling much better today, although the cold's not totally gone.  &nbsp;  Last night, was supposed to go out on a team dinner with client. Skipped it and went to the dance class. Last night's class was really funny. The guys were supposed to twirl the girls around, with each hand individually, and then with both hands, after which there's this step where after ending up cross handed, the girl's supposed to put her arms around the guy's neck and then release hold on the hand. Well, I ended up with the tallest guy around while doing that step for the first time ,and he's like twice my height or something, and it was such a funny scene, I was pretty much rotfl. Such incidents happened throughout, and eveybody was weak with laughter by the time we wrapped up at 9.30. I'd like to continue with the intermediate, but I'd have to have an earlier batch.  &nbsp;  Pretty jobless today....... been chatting with this guy&nbsp;I met on Orkut..... seems nice....&nbsp;

      Worst thing is, all my good friends've moved to another building. I mean, IMs and phone all there, but still, its not the same. Most of the other people I know here bitch about  other  people and I so hate that. So, I'm gonna be a loner from today onwards. Not that I mind - in fact, I sorta like the solitude; but it would be nice to have someone I could talk to uninhibitedly. Well, atleast, I get to see Shabina for a couple more weeks.

      Cold's not gone, but I've come to work. Work I so hate. Hate. HATE. HAAAAAAAAAATE.  I dunno what to do. Big dilemma. I mean, do I quit and look around somewhere else (but then again, its just the work I hate, everything else about this place is nice), or do I just hang in here, atleast till the end of the year and then make a decision?? What if I just go mad in the meantime?  Anyway, today started off without a bang. There was no power at home, so no blow drying hair. And my hair is at that stage of growth right now where it is pretty hopeless even when styled; so today is REAL bad hair day. Can't go to the parlour this weekend either. So, stuck with this for another week.

      Am not well, and hence am at home. Down with a bad cold. But couldn't resist not writing. So logged on and thought I'd put in atleast a line.  Just ate a tablet. Ughhhhh. I hate medicines of any sort; but I don't wanna be stuck at home tomorrow too. So.

      The Idjit I referred to in a previous post just called. So, not an Idjit any more.  I could see the sun from behind all the thick grayish clouds. It looked so.... unreal. Wish I had my camera with me to capture it.  Headache is happening. Gaaaaawwwwwwwdddddd. I hate colds.  I have a club meeting in half an hour's time. Decided to go even though I'm feeling totally down and out coz what the hell, work's not everything, and at a later stage in life, I don't want to repent that I didn't do anything like this.

      Methinx mez coming down with a cold. *Sniffle*  What a walk that was to the class last evening. Expectedly, it started to rain. Ok, Shabina had an umbrella, but it was not of much use. Was quite wet by the time we reached there. And me, with my trousers folded up to form capris, hairy legs and all......... Quite a sight. Thankfully, there were not too many people around, so that was ok.  And I  know  I'll never be able to turn the way Richard does. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Dheeraj hasn't called yet. Idjit.

      I'm not sure whether I like these weekend breaks in my writing. It sort of stops the flow. But then again, I like the break from the net. I mean, I'm like getting big time addicted. Soon I'm going to reach a stage where I won't be able to sleep without the net.  Ok, so, I'm crazy. But then, everybody knows that.  Friday's party was great. I mean, in terms of me having fun. It was ok otherwise. I danced the night the hell away. Had the worst neck pain ever on Saturday. But it was well worth it. But when I saw pops' face when he came to pick me up, I almost lost it. He'd almost got stuck in a water filled pothole (remember the rain on Thursday night?? Well, every evening has been the same) because the car almost stalled because of all the water, and he was worried sick that the almost would become the quite. Anyway, his exact words "You were having fun, while I was almost scared out of my life".  Oh, and Shabina came home, and ran away early next morning, without even having breakfast.  Saturday was spent at Shyamala's house, and shopping and classes, of course. Didn't go to Abhishek's dinner. He was real pissed off. He pissed me off today as well. And Deepak thought I was pissed off at him. Mess.  Sunday was class. Finally decided to ask the faculty whether he was the one I thought he was. Turned out I'd remembered right. He was indeed a senior in school. It's going to be strange sitting in his classes from now on.  Its surely going to rain tonight too. I only hope it starts after I reach classes. Am wondering how I'm going to master the turning thing.  Oh, and Schumi won at the British GP. Again. His 10th in 11 this season. Ho-hum. So what's new??

      It has always so happened that on precisely the days that I decide to absolutely not walk, I do not get a rick till I've walked about half of the way to office. I've noticed this happening every single time. Why do these autorickshaw guys conspire so? But before that, how the hell do they know that I do not plan to walk?  While on the subject of autoricksahws: I've noticed that all the rikshaw meters are manufactured at "Super meter Manufacturing Company", Mundhwa, Pune. What a monopoly.  Partying tonight after a loooooooong time. These guys here are real big time  kanjoos . We're having this party like after 9 months or something. Thats too long to go without having some fun in office.   Some chap's been mailing me after he found me on orkut. Thinks I'm this wonderful spiritual character. HAH. If he only knew.  We received a humungous amount of rain last evening and night. In fact, got pretty wet on my way to the salsa classes. I love the rain.  That reminds me. All the guys in my batch, except for I-think-his-name-is-Atul are hopeless dancers. And Richard is quite crazy I think, not that I'm in a position to comment on  that .  Today, I'm gonna dance till I fall down exhausted.

      The play was simply  mast . I'm glad I went esp. after the doubts I had about whether I should go or not. Quite some people had turned out to watch the play.   The performers were Ruby Chakravarthy, Mustafa Moochhala, Gautam Reddy and Edgar Fernandez and it was directed by Ashish Sen, all a part of TAG. Ruby as Fat was esp. hilarious. Mustafa was great too.   The story revolves around 3 people that are shipwrecked and lost at sea. Their food supply is exhausted, and they need to eat. The only option is to eat one of themselves, but the question is who.....?

      There was a team meeting first thing today morning. The boss started off by saying that now that people had (finally) started getting in before 10.30, she's like to take to take it forward and would like everybody to get in before 9.30. Poof!! Like magic, a whole lotta frayed tempers emerged. A lot of arguing happened, but, knowing the boss, they shouldn't have because nothing came out of it.   I have noticed that in these meetings, the Boss asks people to share their concerns with her so that we can all try to find a solution to people's problems(??!!). Yeah right!! Like anybody's actually gonna put out their thoughts in a meeting!!  Is this how it goes with all project managers or are we the only ones who have a problem?? By my past experience, it sure doesn't happen too often.

      My Salsa classes started yesterday. Finally. And it was so much funnnnnnnn. Agreed, we didn't do much; practised only some basic footwork. But I enjoyed it sooooooooo much.  Maybe its because I've never done anything like it before. But I think it was little bit too much for my friend.

      One Mr. John Taylor has just contacted me. He says he has $25M and is willing to share 30% of that amount with me, if I mail him at his address. He's also promised to invest part of his part of the money in my country. He got the dough from his brother who's in exile.  Oh, ain't that reallll chhhweet of the chap?? I wouldn't be willing to give away 30% of $25M if I had that kind of money.  Oh, and there also was another chap from Namibia (or was it Uruguay) that also wanted to share the money he got when he overthrew somebody or the other. The catch was the $25 I had to send him for administrative expenses or soem such thing.  The world is such a nice place.

      The weekend has been sorta hectic.   Saturday at sis's college was wonderful. College life sure is fun. I sound so old. I'm not. That reminds me. A couple of friends of my sis's asked her whether I was the younger. :)). And that skit about medical students was awesome. An original idea, with superbly selected songs. Her dance was quite good, even though there was that initial hiccup when the tape got messed up. She was looking  so  good on stage. We reached home at 9, dead. It was worth it. I'm going to be a regular graduation day guest. :)  Just saw the results of the first mock CAT. Pathetic performance. A grand total of 44 (ugh), with a percentile of 95.49(ughhhhhhhhhh), and a ranking of 328. Downright pathetic. It should have been somewhere within the top 50, at the least. Me not knowing that there was to be a mock that day is no reason. Oh well, the next mock is on 18th.  Saw half of the French GP yesterday. Schumi won, as usual. Barichello overtook Trulli in the very last lap to come in at 3rd place. That was a neat manoeuvre.  Sat up to watch the EURO final between Portugal and Greece. The match started at 00.10. Fell asleep on the sofa around midnight, woke up around 12.15, could make out neither head nor tail of anything around me, went straight to bed.  The Wimbledon gentlemen's final was better. Federer, the defending champion won, beating Roddick. The first time that the first and second seeds met in a final after McEnroe and Connors in '82. Roddick is soooo cute. And seems to have a sense of humor. And Federer was so unfazed throughout the whole match. No reactions except in the end, when he cried. Sort of like Graf. That was one of the things that I admired in her. So silent and undemonstrative on court.  I'm becoming quite a fan of Sex and the city. It is so overboard, unpretentious and deadpan ,all at the same time.  Vidya would say that it is the grossest serial ever.

      Just read an article about beggars in Mumbai. One particular guy supposedly earns more than 35k a month.   Big time beggar nuisance here in Blr too. Step out to any shopping area and you are accosted. And most of them are children as young as 5 or 6 maybe, and women, invariably with a baby in hand. And people actually give them money. I really wish they wouldn't. I mean, it is ok if the person begging is really, badly disabled, in a state where he really cannot work, but otherwise it is not justified.  The kids are so brash that they literally take things right away from your hands. Recently, there was this photo in the newspaper that showed a little girl taking away an icecream cone from a person just as it was on its way to his mouth. And they take hold of dupattas and scarves as the women walk by and  don't let go till properly berated . And foreigners are the worst affected.   I feel no pity towards them. Most of them are fakes, and begging is an easy, lucrative option.   Like the article said, The next time a beggar sidles up to you, you should think twice. Otherwise the beggar may just turn around with the clinking bowl, change into something snazzy and drive off in a car you always wanted to buy with your 9-to-5 job.

      Got my PAN yesterday. Finally.  May be my fault in a way. Should have applied earlier. Oh well, all's well that ends well.  Yossarian is good. And Clevinger. And Havermeyer. I've been reading about 2 chapters every night. And what one of the reviews said about it was right. Its great if you can take it.  There's a whole lotta movies I wanna see. Troy, Monster, Lakshya, Hum Tum, Spiderman-2, Shrek-2.... Ok, the last 2 not ere yet, but just adding it to the list. WHEN DO I GO AND SEE ALL OF THEM??????  Watching 'em at home on CD IS a possibility; but ewwwww..... the CD quality will surely suck. The only other option is to wait till the original CDs get released, and be the very last person on earth to see them.  Couldn't go to the music club auditions yesterday because of a supposedly - 1-1/2hr - demonstration - but - reduced - to - 15 - minutes - because - of - firewall - problems call. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. And to add fuel to fire, Deepak is going on and on about how amazing it was.  Oh well again. Spilt milk blah blah.  But will go next time. Definitely.

Took me about half an hour to reach office.  The opening ceremony of the  urlLink Olympics  starts at 11.00 pm, my time. I'm so glad I can watch it.  Get together with your kith and kin, Get popcorn, coke and maybe some gin, Its the Olympics, you know, The world's greatest show, Here's to it; may the best man (and woman) win.  I am listening to a couple of Hindi songs right now. Tu hi re and Hoshwalon ko khabar kya. For the (n n ) th  time. And thinking for the (n n  - 1) th  time, how beautiful these songs are. They come under the category of songs-that-give-me-goosebumps. If you feel like listening to them right now, go  urlLink here , and run a search.

      Last evening, I got off from work early for once...  So, I go home, and see this wedding card on the table. I open it and see that its the wedding of this girl I sorta know, one that is two years younger than me. So, that was the first thing I said out loud after seeing her name on the card, and the second I said it, I realized my idiocy. Sure enough, I look up, and see my mom with a big smile on her face, giving me a meaningful sort of look. So I was like - Ok, don't look at me... I won't even think about it for another three years atleast; end of topic - and it was. Thankfully. Not that my folks are bugging me to get married or anything like that, but still, I HAD to make sure I was safe.  Everytime I seriously think about getting married I totally freak out; I mean, I find it almost impossible to breathe and my heart races and I don't know what else... I mean, I find it difficult to digest the fact that I'll probably have to spend my life with someone who will, in all probability, be a stranger the first few years... It scares me. Yeah, yeah, I know almost everybody gets married and goes through the same thing, blah blah, but that does not make it any easier for me.  The runaway bride??  And then the runaway bride, Decided no more would she hide, So she told her mom a groom to pick, With whom till the end she would stick, And on D-day found he was 4 feet tall, and just as wide.  Ewwwwwww... Scary...

      My Salsa classes are over - at least, the beginner level. I need to get my own partner if I want to continue with the next level.... Oh well, it was good while it lasted, and Salsa's fun.   I am terribly busy these days. Atleast, I don't seem to have time to do too many things. Wonder where the twenty four hours in a day are going. Ok, given that I spend eight of those hours getting my beauty sleep, I still have no count for atleast five hours. Its been ages since I sat down to read a book, or actually leisurely listened to music (What I listen to in office during work doesn't count) ,and I only barely remember the last movie I saw in a theatre.   Maybe I should have been on Venus or something... 1 day there (243 earth days) is more than one year (225 earth days)!!!  There was a girl called EnJay Who on Venus wanted to stay, But before she could react, To the retrograde rotation fact, The heat left her brains in massive disarray.

Be More Like Your Dog   - Take plenty of walks and naps.  - Drink lots of water.  - Don't think too much.  - Make friends with everyone in the neighbourhood.  - Don't go for a run without your ID.  - Make the people you love feel welcome when they come home.  - Every now and then stand out in the rain.   --- Anon

      Nafisa Joseph killed herself a few days ago. A celebrity doing that gets into the newspapers. What about all the other people that do so?? Today morning, I read an article in the newspaper that noted that in Kerala, one suicide occurs every hour. The global average suicide rate is 14.5 per 100,000.  Why do people commit suicide?? Most common reasons are chronic/debilitating illness; emotional problems like thwarted love; a means to manipulate others; there have even been cases of people committing suicide for media attention (although I don't see any logic in the latter - of what use is publicity when you are in another universe altogether??).   Suicide probably seems justified for a person who sees no other way out. But I have always wondered about the means and ways that people employ to kill themselves. This probably sounds callous, but I'm just being matter of fact. Wouldn't someone that has decided to kill himself want to do that act in the least painful way possible?? Why would they immolate the self, or cut a vein, or hang themselves, or use the noose?? An overdose of sleeping tablets would probably do the job just as well, and less painfully.  And wouldn't a person that commits suicide be incredibly selfish?? What about all the people in this world that love him?? What about all the people in this world that rely on him??  And would that person ever have thought about the consequences of a suicide attempt gone awry?? A jump from the top of a building that instead of ending it all is just the beginning of a new type of misery?? An overdose of sleeping pills that doesn't kill the body, but just leaves it a shell??  Now for a second, I'll go over to the other side. For somebody that has possibly exhausted all options in trying to find a solution for his problem, or for someone that thinks there is no possible solution to his problem, suicide probably seems like the best option.  This is not to say that I support or condone this act in any way; its just looking at things from two angles. But for someone in a bleak situation, it may seem to be the light at the end of the tunnel, but isn't the fact that the light may be the cause of a lot of darkness a paradox??  Would a person that commits suicide be considered a coward who cannot face the travails that life has to offer?? Doesn't committing suicide in itself require a heck of a lot of courage??   I have no idea what made me start off on this topic. Am I suicidal-ly inclined?? Hmmmmm... But I definitely don't have the courage to do something like that.

      August 6 th , 1945. Almost the end of the second world war.  At about 7.00 A.M, the Japanese radar system had detected a number of American planes flying towards southern Japan. However, at about 8.00 A.M, the radar operator determined that the number of planes coming in was not enough to cause alarm and lifted the air raid alert. The clock ticked to about 8.15 A.M. A blinding flash and a deafening boom. In a few seconds, Hiroshima, and surrounding areas for quite a large radius was razed to the ground. An estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people were killed, killed in the worst way imaginable.   The Uranium bomb that caused such terrible destruction was, ironically enough, nicknamed "Little Boy". A B-29 bomber, with  urlLink Enola Gay  painted across its nose and piloted by Col. Paul Tibbets was the infamous craft that dropped the bomb.  Three days later, on 9 th  August, another attack, this time on Nagasaki, left the same horrendous destruction in its wake. Nagasaki was ill-fated in this, because, the primary target for the second bomb was Kokura. The craft was again a B-29, named Bockscar and its pilot, Major Charles Sweeney, had instructions to drop the bomb only on visual sighting of the target. However bad weather forced him to fly to Nagasaki, which was the secondary target for that day. At about 11.00 A.M, within a time span of maybe 10 seconds, Nagasaki was flattened. An estimated 70,000 people were left dead by another bomb, this time of the Plutonium variety, nicknamed "Fat Boy". Here is a stark comparison of Nagasaki  urlLink before  and  urlLink after  the bombings.  A retaliation for Pearl Harbour?  The worst possible thing was that Japan was on the verge of surrendering to the Allies. It did surrender a few days after the bombings.  Here are some terrible, heart rending  urlLink images  of devastation caused by the bombings, and some  urlLink eye witness accounts  of the same.  Some more links:  urlLink Official documents  regarding the bombings, Einstein's  urlLink letter  to FDR about the possibility of a Uranium weapon, and an interesting  urlLink project  at the Yale law school.

      Ok, results of my third mockcat are out. One word -  Pathetic . 310. Back to square one. That makes my performance something like this.  328(Test1) --> 186(Test2) --> 310(Test3)  Can't get any worse. The rise was because I wanted to do well. The sad dip I attribute to overconfidence.  And this among just 10%-15% of the total that will be writing it on the 21 st  of November.  Depressed.

      Yesterday, a friend told me that he would be going to Scotland soon for a couple of weeks. Later in the evening, I ended up reading an article on Scotland and its whisky.(BTW, generally, "whisky" is used for spirit distilled in Scotland and Canada, while "whiskey", with the "e" is used for that distilled in Ireland and USA.)  So I did some reading on whisky.   The word originated from the Gaelic word "uisge beatha" meaning "water of life". Medicinal properties? Or just somebody with a bad hangover??  Ok, had thought I'd do some whisky dissection here, but don't have the inclination to do that right now. So, shall point to this  urlLink site  instead.  If you want to view some webcams in a distillery, go  urlLink here .  Anecdote: The pentagon was concerned about the above webcams; they thought that whisky distillation might be rather close to the process of making biological/chemical WMD(??!!). Bruichladdich (pronounced Brook-laddy), the distillery with the webcams, responded by bringing out a whisky called WMD - Whisky of Mass Distinction.  Just before I end: "Brut" is the French word for "dry". It is generally used to refer to very dry champagne or sparkling wine.  The end.  Just after I ended: I had my first sip of beer about six years ago. It put me off from trying anything else till about a month ago (Sorry beer lovers, but taste is relative). A month ago, I had some vodka. Excellent progress I suppose. Maybe I  will  progress to the Ballantines and the Chivas Regals of this world before I die.

      A funny thing just happened. I heard this buzzing in my ear. Just like that. Lasted for a second or two maybe. Did I feel something vibrating?? This is the first time that something like this has happened. A more common occurrence is a tinny beep that comes out of nowhere, and again lasts for a couple or a couple of couple of seconds.  That  sometimes leaves me dazed.

      How many people know that "seduce" comes from Latin for "lead astray"?? I definitely did not.  And for those wondering what in the world was I doing thinking about seduction while sitting in office, I just came across a link to this  urlLink article  in another blog, and thought it sounded worth a dekko (and  this  word here comes from Hindi, of course). Work is so boring anyway.

      I've never heard of this song before now. I've never heard of the singer either. But I liked the lyrics. It brought out the hard-core romantic in me. So.   No other lover ever really cared  When I've reached out for you you've always been there  Now I'm so far away and baby I'm scared  I never knew lonely till you   You are my rock and the strength I need  To keep me sane in this life that I lead  Now I'm not with you and my broken heart bleeds  I never knew lonely till you   I never knew lonely could be so blue  I never knew lonely could tear you in two  I never loved someone like I love you  I never knew lonely till you   I can't make up for the times I've been gone  But I'll prove I love you in the words of this song  Back in your arms girl it's where I belong  I never knew lonely till you   I never knew lonely could be so blue  I never knew lonely could tear you in two  I never loved someone like I love you  I never knew lonely till you  -Vince Gill

      Early morning on Saturday. Went for the first round of book distribution after the notebook drive with another eight people from office, and some FoC volunteers. Donated books to three underprivileged schools. It was an amazing experience. So many children. Such enthusiasm for life, even though it had deprived the of a great many things. All of them wanted to wish us a good morning, shake hands with us, take photos with us...  I left with a feeling of immense satisfaction, glad I'd been part of something that had, hopefully, improved someone's life just that little bit.   After that, it was back to the daily grind. Office, and classes later in the evening.  Sunday. Another mock test. Brighter part was managed to meet up with friends in the evening. If I hadn't, it would've been the first friendship day in six years that I'd have missed. Generally goofed around, ate a DBC (would have really died if I'd managed to finish it off), and then ate a lot of chaat. Left me feeling a little pukey, I must confess. Reached home just before dinner, which I skipped (of course). I was pooped. Full time busy weekend. Hardly any time spent at home. Mom and pops were complaining that they hardly get to see me on weekends.  Now in office, Monday morning blues. Literally. Everybody was supposed to be wearing blue; but too many spoilsports around.

      The first bit of news I heard on waking up Saturday morning was that two of my sister's seniors had died in a car accident the previous day, and two more were injured quite badly, and in hospital. The accident had occurred on their way back from Bangalore after they'd picked up no objection certificates for them to do their house surgency in their respective home towns. One guy died on the spot, the other in the hospital. The two injured are in a hospital in Bangalore.  Sis said everybody was crying. Those guys were supposedly real nice, and one of them was extremely good at his studies. Almost doctors. So many hopes and aspirations. All quashed.  One of the guys that died was actually supposed to stay back in Bangalore, since he had plans to go to Chennai with a friend on my sister's, and they had planned to leave from Bangalore. Maybe if he hadn't decided to go back to college... I can't imagine the state of his parents... They had been informed that his injuries were grievous and were on their way to see him when they got the news that he died. They went back home because they couldn't handle it.  I wonder how the survivors will be feeling. What will go through their heads, when they realize that by a twist of fate, they were the half that survived a disaster?? Guilty, or glad?? Goodness, I can't imagine. Sis said they will need extensive corrective plastic surgery. Wonder how long they'll take to get back to normal, both physically and mentally, after such a huge shock.
