        I have not been involved with the outreacha t the prison in Pendleon but I have heard about this ministry from many who have been.    For the last month there has been a "lockdown" at Pendleton due to rumors of a riot or escape.  As a result fo the lockdown none of the prisoners are let out of their cells because of the retribution the prison officials are taking.    Their belief is that if one person did something everyone should pay for this.  This lockdown may last 6 months or more.    At our church the ourteach to Pendleton has been on everyone's mind.  We have brothers in Christ in this place. Admittedly many have done bad things and have been involved in things they should not have.  Many have used this time to find Christ and to begin a relationship with Him.  Now they are unable to be involved in this ministry outreach because of a few.  Prayer Requests  Be in prayer for the officials, be in prayer for the guards, be in prayer for the inmates.  Remember our brothers and sisters in Iraq, regardless of your war opinion.  Be in deep prayer for our President. If your opinion of him or his politics gets in the way of this prayer .  Examine your concience.  Please be in prayer for South Memorial Drive Church Of God and the pastoral staff.  Mark Martin, Curt Ferrel, and Tami Bird.  Be in prayer for members of the congregation.  Don and Liz Johnson, Jenni Sowers.  Remember me in prayer as God does His WIll in His time and everything has purpose even if we don't know what that is.  5.31.04

        Thank you Lord for sending us a Holy Counselor, the Holy Spirit.    When I was Baptised at age 12 I was baptised in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.      (During the past thirty years The Holy Ghost became the Holy Spirit.  This was because of the connotation given to Ghosts in our fallen world. African churches and evangelical churches still have the Holy Ghost.  Kirk Franklin in Stomp invites listeners to have a Holy Ghost Party with him.  Having learned about the Holy Ghost I still have The Holy Ghost in my heart.)    Why did I not understand what I had been given?  Why do most people not know what great resource they have within themselves?    I have been getting e-mails from someone who has been trying to keep his or her faith and is discouraged. They felt they had been given encouragement by people or media and then later had second thoughts.    Yes, you can get encouragement from outside sources.  Men can fail, even great men.  The Holy Counselor, The Holy Spirit will never fail.    Christ taught his disciples or Talidim that he would be leaving soon to be with his Father.  Memorizing hasn't been my forte' and I don't have my magnifying glass to read this passage so here is the MCR (Marty Cant Read)translation.    I am going to be with my Father in Heaven.  Don't worry though, I'm sending you a Counselor to be with you.  This Counselor is the Holy Spirit.    I beleive that Christ beckons all through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.  You don't have to ask, you don't have to have faith, the Holy Spirit is within you beckoning you from the time you are young. (I was with you in the womb)    I have felt the Holy Spirit from an early age yet didn't understand, and don't understand fully to the glory of God.    I have been told that ministry outreach is not prudent because God has a plan and a purpose that will ultimately come through regardless.  Our invovlement is not needed and does not accomplish anything.  This is called Predetermination.   The Holy Spirit indwelling in me teaches me and guides me that we have a loving God and that there is ALWAYS hope for the lost. Would such a God allow the unsaved to continue on a path to Hell with no detour, rest stop, or screaming police car with flashing lights?  I felt the call of the Holy Spirit prior to Age 12 and did not act on it's calling.  Later I did in believer's baptism and still did not succumb to the total Will of the Holy Spirit.  I still felt the guidance, the offer of help, and the Peace offered by the Holy Counselor.  While the Holy Spirit and my own will had the ability to make the life changes I needed, I was too weak to act on my own. I did not make the changes I needed in my life until I was lovingly bullied into it by someone I cared for.  Without the call of the Holy Spirit the outreach to me would have been worthless.  I can't avoid outreach or mission responsibilities because of predestination or predetermination.    God made us to serve Him but He didn't make us robots, He gave us free will.  He wants us to serve him , to worship Him, and He wants us to Love Him. It has to be our choice though.  How different my life might have been.  I am not making conclusions here because most people don't understand what the Bible says. Generalities , yes, those are clear.   Love your neighbor as Christ loved you, even to death.  Very clear.   Deep Issues like this, though, make people divisive because our minds are unable to comprehend fully what the Bible says. Some might claim full knowledge but God hasn't given this to any man - read Revelations.  We will understand in Heaven if our name is in the book.  Thank you Father , Son , and Holy Spirit  5.30.04

      This is a posting of the IndyStar article on WJCF.  Thanks to Ron Hawkins who took time to put this article together and for the Star for publishing it.    GREENFIELD    Radio brings ministry home   Couple say spiritual path led them to run Christian music station from their house.    By Ronald Hawkins Star correspondent May 27, 2004    Marty and Jennifer Hensley started a spiritual journey when they met in Evansville in 1994.  The path led to their marriage and the creation of WJCF, a contemporary Christian FM radio station based in Greenfield.  The station's call letters are an acronym for Where Jesus Comes First, a theme posted throughout the studio, as well as on the nonprofit station's van and promotional materials.  The Hensleys were married in 1994. WJCF went on the air in 2000 from their Greenfield home.  Marty was a radio engineer who previously had worked as a disc jockey on Indianapolis rock stations in the early 1980s. Jennifer Hensley was a medical laboratory assistant with little knowledge of radio when they met, but she was called into a Christian ministry when she was 14, she said.  "It took me a while to like Christian contemporary music," Marty Hensley said. "It was a faith path. The more I grew, the more I wanted to do this.  "I was somewhat spiritual, and I was baptized at 12, but I didn't get it until I was in my 30s."  In the years since they got married, Jennifer Hensley's involvement in the radio business has expanded. She is president of Indiana Community Radio Corp., which owns the nonprofit station, and the station's license is in her name. The tower leasing service she offers is the family's chief source of income.  Hensley is chief engineering operator, but his wife also has learned many of those skills. Volunteers make the station viable and provide a backup for Hensley when his health problems interfere with his work.  Marty Hensley, 42, suffers from diabetes, kidney problems, high blood pressure and narcolepsy. In February, he had a small stroke. He is now preparing to undergo a pancreas and kidney transplant.  His diabetes has led to diabetic retinopathy, a condition that damages the blood vessels in the back of the eye.  Hensley does not drive anymore, but since the radio station is in his home, near downtown Greenfield, he doesn't have to travel far to go to work. It also enables their four children to be involved in the station's operations.  Inside in the studio, Hensley wears dark glasses to protect his eyes -- not to be cool.  But a teenage host of WJCF's "Saturday Night Rock Show" says the Hensleys are very cool.  "I love them," said A.J. Fager, a 17-year-old co-host of the show. "They are some of the greatest people I've ever met."  The 6 to 9 p.m. rock show is the most popular program on the station, the Hensleys say.  The Hensleys have provided adult volunteers and teenagers the opportunity to use the FM airwaves to share their Christian-oriented messages.  Contemporary Christian music forms the core of the station's programming. Volunteers provide Bible readings between songs.  Mercy Me is the most requested group. The group's "I Can Only Imagine" crossed over to the popular music charts from Christian contemporary.  "Most of the music has a story to tell," Marty Hensley said. Those stories relate to the Christian faith.  The station is on the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but residents of Greenfield and neighboring communities produce most of the programming. Only three programs aren't produced locally.  Jim Carie, a Greenfield resident, is the host of a Saturday morning program about men and women of the Bible.  "World Renewal," another Saturday morning program, is a product of a Greenfield-based ministry that has missions in Mexico and South America  The station doesn't limit its broadcasting to one denomination.  "We consider ourselves non-denominational," Hensley said. "We try to include all mainstream churches."  That means Roman Catholic as well as Protestant, he said.  "We caught some heat for that," he said. "We promote things at all the Catholic churches. I don't think we've turned anything down."  Other groups have had items on the air, too, including Messianic Jews, Hensley said.  There have been no requests from Islamic groups, but a Muslim was interviewed for a program comparing Islam and Christianity.  The Hensleys attend two churches: St. Michael's Catholic Church in Greenfield and South Memorial Church of God in New Castle.  In addition to its spiritual message, WJCF is a community station, Hensley said. The only other radio station in Greenfield is WRGF-FM (89.7), which is operated out of Greenfield-Central High School.  WJCF broadcasts Eastern Hancock basketball games and Greenfield-Central football games. It has promoted charitable events such as the annual American Cancer Society walk.  The station has provided airtime for many other community events but does not mention alcoholic beverages if that is part of the event, Hensley said.  Having a radio station in their home means the Hensleys are rarely able to get away from work.  Sometimes people are visiting the station as late as 11 p.m. But there's a positive side, too.  "It's here, and we don't have to go anywhere," he said. "With my health the way it is, it's been something I can still do at home."    About WJCF • Web site: www.wjcfradio.org links the station to the world. It gets about 2,000 visits per day from people as far away as Australia, Belize, Canada, Israel and the United Kingdom. • Tower: The station's tower is on the Rush-Henry County line. The Hensleys are hoping to boost its signal south to Columbus and north to Muncie. When the station was launched, there were complaints that its signal at 88.1 FM interfered with WRTV (Channel 6), which has an audio signal at 87.7 FM. The Hensleys have provided filters for people who want to eliminate interference. • Finances: Underwriters help support the nonprofit station. On-the-air fund-raisers also help pay the costs of operating the station. The Hensleys started the station with their savings. Neither the Hensleys nor the volunteers are paid, although volunteers are reimbursed for driving expenses.   Credit to IndyStar.com

        Chris at New Castle has been my prayer partner for some time.  I have also gained a new prayer partner who has been asking me tough questions.    I always beleived that hating someone was the willful act of deciding you wanted to pray the prayer of the Greyhound Bus, the Mack Truck , or the Amtrack Special for this person. (Hint - each prayer involves a large moving object)    Christ taught us to love our enemies.   John 13:35  A New Command I give you: Love  one another.  As I have loved you, so you must love one another.  By this all men will know that you are my disciples , if you love one another.     My recent past experience has not been this way with other Christians.  When Jennifer constructed the radio station we would get phone calls from Christians who were unhappy.  Yes, there were some with technical problems. Jennifer resolved all those who would let her.    Others wanted her dead because she decided to evangelize using radio.  Because I help her these folks wanted me dead too.  Some of these, in our area, have rejected Christ and anything having to do with a Church, religion (a word many mistake for a relationship with Christ), or His teachings.   "We don't want Christ shoved down our throats."  (Guess they can only tune in one radio channel)We will pray for you.  "That is uncalled for."    Now , some of this group were Christians who felt that unless she aired Hymn music this was a blasphemy. These were older Christians who were saved many years ago. They didn't see the need for daily encouragement in a contemporary music style as being beneficial. They had lost perspective that they didn't need this but people under 70 might.  This level of hate was being sent from Christians to other Christians who didn't do things their way.  No good example is any good unless it hits home.  I have been challenged that even though I don't wish someone dead I can be violating what Christ teaches if I treat another person as if he or she is dead or doesn't exist or if I simply do not Love this person as Christ Loves Me.  In my personal life I have two people who have hurt me deeply and have done cruel, vile, evil things.  Despite attempts to resolve this both people are hateful and vindictive. This is not a judgement but an observation. I go no further in explaining.  My human side would allow me to treat these two the way that they treat me.  Have I gone to a Christian brother or sister and asked for assistance in resolving the dispute?  Have I gone farther and talked to elders?  Yes.  Should I not treat them as unbelievers?  Legalistically this would be in accordance with what is taught in the Bible, if you look at at this passage only. Big Book ...small mind.  Christ said If you love Me , you will obey what I command.  And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever--  This Counselor is the Holy Spirit indwelling in us.  I accept that Christ places us in the highway of others who can counsel us also...for this earthly counsel I am thankful as well.  I can acknowledge that I am unhappy with what has been done to me. I have had no choice in what has been done.  I have accepted what has been done.  Do I love these as Christ loves me?  I cannot say yes and be truthful.  What does this sinner do now?  I pray for one every day and have for some time. The other I need to pray for every day as I pray for my own needs. Christ teaches us to Love our enemies.  An Enemy can be someone you have no ill will towards but wants to do you harm, even death.  Now pray the prayer of the toothpick in someone else's eye and a  two by four in my own..."God be with this Jerk who continues to do evil things..."   God, Love the people who I feel have wronged me.  Help me to Love them as Christ Loves Me.  Help me to find Your Peace and Love in my Heart so I can truly be your servant and a man after your heart.  Thank you for your many blessings.  Thank you for a loving wife who loves You and others in such a way that I have learned what Love is and can be.  Thank you for another day to serve. Thank you for the blessings of the internet to share my journey with other beleivers, and them with me.  Thank you for the sacrifice of Your Son Jesus Christ.  Amen

      This is a post from Bill Roberts of Knightstown.  After I read this I fetlt called to take selective parts of his recent posting.  This is plagerism if I don't mention the source.  OK. Well...Take a deep breath, Bill, and start again. I have updated the blogsite as you can tell. I've done this for several reasons. One, I will not be using haloscan for the commenting areas. This will give me the ability to easily control the viewing of comments if they get out of control. Is this censorship? Yes. Does it violate the principles of free publishing and blogging? Yes. But the fact of the matter is this: Sometimes we say hurtful and mean things under the guise of christianity. Personally, I don't want to host that. So, now we have options.   Finally, I want to be honest enough to tell you that the last episode with the comments was extremely hurtful to me. Thus, the hiatus. This little community has been a wonderful experiment for me over the last year. It has been a way for the people that I have met around the world to get together and know each other. We have been able to spur one another on to better thinking and, at times, it has given us hope that perhaps one day we might see and live a better expression of the church in the earth. I've missed you during my time away, but I have not missed the fighting. Please, let's live the way that Jesus taught us to live. To love one another...even if we consider some to be our enemies. Let's show the world that student/followers of Jesus really are different.

        I was supposed to be at (A Major Hospital) for tissue testing today.  At 7am they call and need more paperwork.    Here is how the process works...  If you are sick no matter how sick, the transplant department will not consider speaking with you unless your insurance can first be verified.  If after a lengthy process it can be determined your insurance can be verified and also covers organ transplants the staff at IU will then schedule an appointment.    The first part takes over a month.  Now a decision needs to be made, are you sick enough to receive a pancreas and a kidney?  Is your pancreas so bad yet your kidney too good enough you do not qualify for both?  If the pancreas is bad and the kidney bad but not good enough to live through a transplant then you have to wait for the kidney to go really bad despite what other problems exist.  If the pancreas is bad and the kidney is going bad and will be killed by the transplant why not go ahead and give me both????  Now I need to send to a nephrologist.  I thought that this was something to do with dead people but that is something else altogether....  A nephrologist may be able to treat my kidneys to make them a little better so I can get a pancreas.  In this process I am trying to loose weight so I can be a better recipient with fewer complications.  In this process I am trying to accept God's Will for my life.  With the frustration and other problems I face this is tough.    I have learned today I need to not internalize my problems so much and find a release for my problems.  God doesn't want us to worry about tomorrow.  Literally this is a sin I believe.  If we are worrying we aren't trusitng God.  Thank God he is a merciful God.  Hug your children, kiss your wife, thank God for your blessings.  5.27.04  mlh

        My son Brink has been teaching me life lessons.  How does a seven year old do this?   The way he accepts Christ, having been raised in the faith, something about the innocence of his belief....    Brook "graduated" from Pre-School and is now a Kitergarter or so she says.  The graduation ceremony was caught on tape.  Maybe some cap and gown pictures will appear...    Storm last night.  Lightning, Thunder, Flash.  All at once.  Reset breakers in the house and this seems to be the extent of the damage we hope.  A demonstration of His power.    IU Thursday.  Pray for God News on Pancreas and Kidney fronts.  I want to live some more, if it is His Will.  5.25.04 mlh

      What a Great Show - Ministry - Revival  last night.  Have you ever seen the Apologetix?  They are a parody band that takes secular songs and places Christian lyrics within the secular music.  Several Eminem songs, Bob Seger, Steve Miller, Lynard Skynard, and more.  Got to talk with J Jackson who is their Lead singer this last week 3 times.  He loves God and has shared his personal testimony.  Thank You if you attended.  Event was at Park Chapel Christian Church in Greenfield.  Also Thank You to Carl, Keith, and oh I forgot the drummer's name.  We are blessed to lvie when we live and to have the experiences we have now.  Thank you to Mike at Cheerful Heart, Sam at Indiana Christian News, the pastoral Staff at Park Chapel, and anyone else I missed.  5.23.04

        Raising children is so tough.   Try to do the right thing and how do you know if it took....or not?    My oldest daughter is 20 and getting married today.  She went off the path years ago and Dad didn't approve of some of her life choices.  She didn't appreciate Dad's public service work.  Mom pushed her away from a relationship with Dad.  Dad was simply a "donor" and you don't have to have a relationship with him.    Laura's Mom was in the psych ward every year at Christmas when Laura was young.  She was upset that her life wasn't as picture perfect as those who were on television commercials and Christmas programs. Mom was molested by her brother when she was young and I beleive this messed her up and she still ahsn't dealt with it and won't deal with it.  Am I blaming her?  No, just explaining what Laura went through.  Is it tough when your family isn't good enough?  My children aren't like the children on television, my husband isn't like the man on television, my parents aren't like....  How does this affect a child at an impressioanble age?    Laura's mom convinced her that Dad would try to kidnap her and Laura spent years in therapy because of these delusions.    She is getting married today.  I don't know who is giving her away.  I wasn't invited to the wedding but did get an invitation to rub my nose in it.  I wasn't her Dad and wasn't listed on the invitation.  It was clear I wasn't welcome.    Not only was Dad not included but any family member on "my" side of the family was left out.  5 years now of isolation.    My mother had what we thought was a good relationship with Laura but she was cut off completely. This has hurt her and the other family members who have been shut out, because of the jealousy and envy that created this.     Much of this began when my younger daughter Brook was born.  Her wedding is on the weekend of Brook's Birthday.      We include her in every meal prayer even though her youngest siblings haven't a memory of meeting her.  Remembering her at prayer, every time, is our way ofdealing with her isolation.    When one parent uses a child to try to get back at the father this is what happens.  Our Court system refuses to do anything about this.  The Judge in the case is a friend of mom's family.  What did I expect? God still ahs a plan.    I love Laura and I want the same thing for her I want for my other children.  At 5 years old she said she ahd Jesus in her heart and in her mind.  I want her to have a relationship with God through His Son Jesus Christ.  If she has this I can be happy regardless of what relationship she has with me.    Be in prayer for Laura today as she starts a family and makes a covenant.    I have sent cards, birthday and Christmas presents, have asked to see her, to no avail. In discussion after discussion it is clear all I can do is pray for her.    It is important to remember that God has given me three other children and a loving wife.  Does this take the place of the lost one, no.  Each child is a blessing from God. Each blessing is different.  This provides comfort as I deal with the Health Issues and daily struggles.  Thank God for Jennifer and her understanding.  I have been a real pooh to deal with this month as a result of the marriage and the surrounding issues.  Jennifer has tolerated me and hasn't been too gripy... just kidding.  Jennifer has been great.  I had family time with Brink Brook and Asa yesterday and hope that today will be the same.

          I have asked for prayer and will pass this prayer request and update along to you.    My eye doctor has said that my eye problems are related to my kidneys shutting down or being imapired.  At last check my kidneys are at 50% and I am having problems.    We go to IU this next week for evaluation of a pancreas and kidney transplant. If I am a good candidate, if I meet criteria, if , if, I could be normal for the first time.    This is the first time I have seen a fighting chance with these health problems in some time, in a physical sense.    Last year in August we visited my dad in Florida and I knew this might be the last time I would see my dad because of the way things had been going.      I received prayer from the church and annointed healing by the body.  It healed my spirit, and gave me peace about what was happening.  I believe my body can be healed and God has the power to heal me.  I also believe he gives man the ability to cure health issues through medicine.    Jennifer and I finished our Level 1 Discipleship training last year.  We have spent this year in study of the Bible and the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.  This was a result of Brink being in St. Michael's school in Greenfield and our need to learn the nuances of what Brink was being taught. In addition we continued our study of the new testament with Alan Janney at South Memorial Drive Church Of God in New Castle.  I have also enjoyed messages by Mark martinn and Jim Lyon both with the Church Of God.      We are thankful Brink spends a part of every day, at home and at school learning about God.  The daily relationship with Christ will not ultimately come from a denomination, from Mom or Dad, from a forced Bible training, but only from the calling fo teh Holy Spirit in my child.    With all the groups we come into contact with we have discovered that the common theme being taught in any mainstream church is a loving relationship with Christ.    In Discipleship training Mark Martin compared beliefs with a big Circle.  The Circle represents our beliefs.  Some might fall within the circle, others on the edge but still inside, and others on the edge on the outside. Some way out of the circle....(Unity Church an example)    Since I get to see it all I see a great awakening in the Church.  People are reading the Word and learning it isn't about legalistic thinking but about a relationship with God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  In this light we have been praying for renewal and reconciliation at SMDCHOG.    If you get to Greenfield please stop in.  I am not sure how much longer I am going to be around but I am hopeful I will be here to see my kids become adults if it is God's Will.    BTW I have a new phrase I am working on.  People all the time say Good Luck as a way to impress upon someone that they are with them in their journey to wherever.  You want to leave a friend or a loved one with a short phrase that lets them know how you feel or  gives them encouragement.    I always used this as a crutch.  I stopped after I realised there is no luck, only God's will.     Godspeed sounds King James and God be with you sounds stuffy sometimes but I still used it for lack of a more to the point parting message.      I wanted something that was Godly in a way the World would understand and this phrase needed to be simple but also profound.  I have been playing word games on the computer to keep my mind sharp.  I have decided that if our path through life is "luck" it is luck based on God's Will.  I also see that Good and God are only 1 letter apart.    From now on I hope you will join me in wishing people=    God Luck     Marty  PS - Please be in prayer for Donna Stephens.  She needs a wheel chair and a new hula skirt. Actually she only wants the chair but I believe God will also supply the hula skirt.  The powered wheel chair will allow her to go to ministry events.  She needs encouragement and your prayers for what she is going through now are needed.  5.21.04 mlh

        Today we celebrated 2 birthdays.  Lorraine turns 16 and Brook turns 5.    I love Lorraine like she is my daughter. She was my brother Steve's daughter.      We go to IU for Pancreas and Kidney evaluation next week. Will I get a transplant?  I need your prayers.  Lorraine said she would give me one of her kidneys if she was a match.      Brook and Lorraine had a party after Lorraine's program at school.  We all went.    I thank God for Jennifer who takes care of me.  I Thank God for His Love duirng these times of illness.  I don't know what His Plans are but I Thank Him for allowing me to be here and see it unfold.  Love to all   Marty  5.20.04  mlh

        My visit to the eye specialist was today.  Not good news or bad news...just news.    The Doctor says that my eyes are full of fluid and this is normally due to Kidney function problems.  Unless my kidneys improve my eyes will not improve.    Yes my Kidneys have been in bad shape related to the diabetes.  My eyes have been going bad for some time, again diabetes related.    Their plan is to wait 6 weeks and give me more laser zaps  or steroid shots.    I still ask God to heal me of my health issues because I know he can.  I also know he has given us Doctors and Hospitals to heal the sick.      I pray to God that he give me the divine knowledge, the discernment, to understand His Will and His Plan for me.  Lord make me a man after Your Heart.     If you read this message be blessed.   May God show you The Way in Your Life as He continues to show me the path in mine.  Be cleansed in His Mercy and Grace and live Your Life for Him.  We were made to worship Him.  He loved us so much He sent His Son who Died on the Cross for our Sins, to Rise Again and show us the Miracle of everlasting Life.    God, Bless Bob Tannehill today.  He is in room 235 at Hancock Memorial Hospital in Greenfield.  His health problems and his continued service to the Lord are a Testimony to You.  Bless him, his wife, his children.  Help him in his struggle to deal with the Doctors, the medicines, the bills, the insurance, and any other stress filled problem.  Help him to know he is lvoed by those in the community and that he is doing something that cannot be replaced.     We love you Lord.  5.19.04  mlh

        Many people take their eyesight for granted.  Am I too old to learn Braille?  I am legally blind as a result of my diabetes.    Another visit to the eye doctor today.  Laser surgery a possibility.  I have already had two rounds and steroid shots in one eye.  Shot as in big needle.  I thought you weren't supposed to put things in your eye....    Through this God has been showing me His Will.  Lord make me a man after your own heart.  Help me be submissive to your will.  Make me more like You and less like Men.  Praise You for Your Glory. Thank You for Your lessons and for Your Love.  5.19.04  mlh

        I use a study Bible because I don't always know where to turn for answers.  In looking for answers that I can relate to the Holy Word I found the following:     Uncertanties :  Beauty, Men's Promises, Riches, The Future, Friendship, Life, and Earthly Glory. James 4:14 "Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow.  What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."    Scripture has always been interpreted in 3 ways for me :  A Command, A Promise, An Instruction.  The Lord has Promised and Instructed  I am only here a short while.  I am a mist here for a little while and then I will vanish.  Most people live a full life into their 70's with few health problems.  Unlike those who don't worry about spiritual needs, only earthly needs, I am aware I do not have time for this.  God's promise that I will have life eternal is comforting and gives me hope.  I'm not an ant or a bug that lives for a time then ceases to exist.  I am in His image and his Child and expect life eternal.  God allows me to see the future and be ready for it.    If you suffer as a Christian do not be ashamed.  1 Peter 4:12-19.  My suffering isn't because I'm a Christian but I can suffer as a Christian.  Thse who suffer according to God's Will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.    I'm sick and I don't want to stop serving God.  Sickness makes it difficult sometimes but other times it gives me resolve to do his work regardless.  Can I keep doing His work?  Can I do it without grumbling or feeling sorry for myself?  Not always.  It gives me a benchmark to shoot for.  My reward will be great.    Matthew 9:12.  "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.  But go and Learn what this means: I desire Mercy, not sacrifice.  For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.    I want to learn what this means.  Christ many times healed the sick and in most cases this invovled : Your sins are forgiven.    Has Christ used my sickness to call me closer to Him?  If this was the plan it is working.  I am a wreck physically and mentally most of the time.  The one constant I have is Christ and this gives me comfort.  May 17 mlh

        Writing about my health to me seems sometimes a negative effort.  I have little time for a negative unless it has a positive attached. When I read anything in the New Testament though I see struggle as a double edged point.     Someone told me that when he feels down because he is sick or has another problem and wants to die he looks at my life and feels better.    I am so glad I can be encouragement for someone.    I start injections today.  Shots.  Needles.  These injections contain EPO.  Short name for a big medicine.  Those of us with end stage renal failure do this because our kidneys are less than 50%.  After this comes dialysis.  From what I read of dialysis it may help my health though.    I talk to IU about a kidney transplant soon.  If it is God's Will I can accept the promise of a longer life and claim it for Christ.    Some poeple have not interpreted an earlier message as I intended.  Today is a Good Day to Die for the Lord.  This doesn't mean I want to die or I am giving up.  I am here.  I am ready to serve.     I hurt every day.  I can't see well enough to do what I want or need to do. It is a struggle to walk, to think, to do even the most common of tasks.  I am a child for my wife to take care of.     I have a mind, not so far gone I cannot use it.  I can still think about questions of importance and relevance, things of God.  If my body fails, if my eyesight leaves, I will still be able to think and by God's Grace, will still be able to act on these thoughts, even though they are limited by my body.     I have been asking for prayer.  I know God heals all diseases and that you can do anything with God.    For those who are in the process of praying, and for my family, please read about kidney disease.     Life is a struggle.  I know of no person who has lived an "easy" life.  We have mountains and valleys we need to pass through our life.  Sitting and never taking the journey does is of no benefit, or simply is of no use.   Like all men I sometimes refuse to look at the road map and accept I am lost.  Accepting that you are lost, looking at the map, or asking for directions, is the key.      If you are willing to submit, or willing to accept that you are lost, this is the first step. Acceptance and submission.    God gives you the road map in his Holy Word, The Bible.  God gives you the Word made flesh in His Son Jesus Christ.  Directions are from the Holy Spirit.  Have you given your life to God and accepted His plan for your life?  If you need to pray for salvation please call me, anytime. (317) 467-1062.  You can also go to the website www.wjcfradio.org and click the link to becoming a Christian.     It was pointed out to me last week that the act of Baptism is given much importance in this description of how to find Christ.  Christ accepted the sinner on the cross and he is in heaven.    There are two forms of baptism - water and holy spirit.  When you accept Christ and invite the Holy Spirit to come into your heart you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, many beleive, and so do I.   Anemia in Kidney Disease and Dialysis   If your blood is low in red blood cells, you have anemia. Red blood cells carry oxygen (O2) to tissues and organs throughout your body and enable them to use the energy from food. Without oxygen, these tissues and organs--particularly the heart and brain--may not do their jobs as well as they should. For this reason, if you have anemia, you may tire easily and look pale. Anemia may also contribute to heart problems.   Anemia is common in people with kidney disease. Healthy kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce the proper number of red blood cells needed to carry oxygen to vital organs. Diseased kidneys, however, often don't make enough EPO. As a result, the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells. Other common causes of anemia include loss of blood from hemodialysis and low levels of iron and folic acid. These nutrients from food help young red blood cells make hemoglobin (Hgb), their main oxygen-carrying protein.    Healthy kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells needed to carry oxygen (O2) throughout the body.  Diseased kidneys don't make enough EPO, and bone marrow then makes fewer red blood cells.    Laboratory Tests A complete blood count (CBC), a laboratory test performed on a sample of your blood, includes a determination of your hematocrit (Hct), the percentage of the blood that consists of red blood cells. The CBC also measures the amount of Hgb in your blood. The range of normal Hct and Hgb in women who menstruate is slightly lower than for healthy men or healthy postmenopausal women. The Hgb is usually about one-third the value of the Hct.     When Anemia Begins Anemia may begin to develop in the early stages of kidney disease, when you still have 20 percent to 50 percent of your normal kidney function. This partial loss of kidney function is often called chronic renal insufficiency. Anemia tends to worsen as kidney disease progresses. End-stage kidney failure, the point at which dialysis or kidney transplantation becomes necessary, doesn't occur until you have only about 10 percent of your kidney function remaining. Nearly everyone with end-stage kidney failure has anemia.     Diagnosis If you have lost at least half of normal kidney function (serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL) and have a low Hct, the most likely cause of anemia is decreased EPO production. The National Kidney Foundation's Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) recommends that doctors begin a detailed evaluation of anemia in men and postmenopausal women on dialysis when the Hct value falls below 37 percent. For women of childbearing age, evaluation should begin when the Hct falls below 33 percent. The evaluation will include tests for iron deficiency and blood loss in the stool to be certain there are no other reasons for the anemia.  When to Evaluate Dialysis Patients for Anemia   Hematocrit (Hct) Hemoglobin (Hgb)  Women who menstruate less than 33% less than 11 g/dL  All men and postmenopausal women less than 37% less than 12 g/dL    Source: The National Kidney Foundation's Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative.    Treatment EPO If no other cause for EPO deficiency is found, it can be treated with a genetically engineered form of the hormone, which is usually injected under the skin two or three times a week. Hemodialysis patients who can't tolerate EPO shots may receive the hormone intravenously during treatment, but this method requires a larger, more expensive dose and may not be as effective. DOQI recommends that patients treated with EPO therapy should achieve a target Hgb of 11 to 12 g/dL.  Iron Many people with kidney disease need both EPO and iron supplements to raise their Hct to a satisfactory level. If your iron levels are too low, EPO won't help and you'll continue to experience the effects of anemia. You may be able to take an iron pill, but many studies show that iron pills don't work as well in people with kidney failure as iron given intravenously. Iron is injected directly into an arm or into the tube that returns blood to your body during hemodialysis.  A nurse or doctor will give you a test dose because a very small number of people (less than 1 percent) have a bad reaction to iron injections. If you begin to wheeze or have trouble breathing, your health care provider can administer epinephrine or corticosteroids to counter the reaction. Even though the risk is small, you'll be asked to sign a form stating that you understand the possible reaction and that you agree to have the treatment. Talk with your health care provider if you have any questions.   In addition to measuring your Hct and Hgb, your tests will also include two measurements to show whether you have enough iron.   Your ferritin level indicates the amount of iron stored in your body. According to DOQI guidelines, your ferritin score should be no less than 100 micrograms per liter (mcg/L) and no more than 800 mcg/L.   TSAT stands for transferrin saturation, a score that indicates how much iron is available to make red blood cells. DOQI guidelines call for a TSAT score between 20 percent and 50 percent.    Other Causes of Anemia In addition to EPO and iron, a few people may also need vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements.  If EPO, iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid all fail, your doctor should look for other causes such as sickle cell disease or an inflammatory problem. At one time, aluminum poisoning contributed to anemia in people with kidney failure because many phosphate binders used to treat bone disease caused by kidney failure were antacids that contained aluminum. But aluminum-free alternatives are now widely available. Be sure your phosphate binder and your other drugs are free of aluminum.  Anemia keeps many people with kidney disease from feeling their best. But EPO treatments help most patients raise their Hgb, feel better, live longer, and have more energy.     Hope Through Research The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), through its Division of Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases, supports several programs and studies devoted to improving treatment for patients with progressive kidney disease and end-stage kidney failure (sometimes called end-stage renal disease, or ESRD), including patients on hemodialysis:  The End-Stage Renal Disease Program. This program promotes research to reduce medical problems from bone, blood, nervous system, metabolic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and endocrine abnormalities in end-stage kidney failure and to improve the effectiveness of dialysis and transplantation. The research focuses on reuse of hemodialysis membranes and on using alternative dialyzer sterilization methods; on devising more efficient, biocompatible membranes; on refining high-flux hemodialysis; and on developing criteria for dialysis adequacy. The program also seeks to increase kidney graft and patient survival and to maximize quality of life.

        The Theme of my life has been Life Is Too Short....  I have followed a series at Brandywine Community Church on the same subject.    This parable comes from Greg Chaney of Greenfield, although I have seen it previously.   When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar and the coffee.  We must be careful to set our priorities carefully and then stick to the decisions      The Mayonnaise Jar and the Coffee    A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front on him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed it was.  So then the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full.   They agreed it was. The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar and of course the sand filled up everything else up. He asked once more if the jar was full.  The students responded with an unanimous "yes." The professor then produced two coffee cups of coffee from   under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.  "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided. "I   want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things - your family, your children, your health, your friends, and your favorite passions - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.   The pebblesare the other things that matter like your job, your house, and your car.   The sand is everything else - the small stuff.   If you put the sand in the jar first, he continued, "There is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.   The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.  Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your spouse to dinner.   Spend time with your parents for you won't always have them in your life. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal. Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter.   Set your priorities. The rest is just sand. One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represents? The professor smiled. "I am glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there is always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend."

      Fear is something to be feared?    Fear is something to be faced?  Fearing Fear gives it strength.  Facing it makes it weak.  This may be how God gives us charachter.  People spend their lives worrying about minor things.  If I tell someone how I feel how will they respond?  If I take initiative will I fall on my butt?  No action done in a reckless manner can be considered in this context.  This is only when looking at an event or a relationship with a Godly perspective.    Be bold, live life, don't sit back and let it pass by.  God lvoes you and wants you to live a full and rpoductive life.    Mistakes will be made.  This is a growing experience.   Loose the experience and loose the chance to grow.    With God we have nothing to fear.

        We have had a mess this week!    Jennifer's grandfather passed away.  He had been in poor health for some time.  I thank God for Jennifer every day and everything she does.    For those that listen to WJCF... Friday night at 11:30 it went kaboom.  Station lost power supply parts and will replace and old tube.    Jennifer worked on the transmitter until 3am Saturday and I helped.  Station was on very low power until 11am Saturday. Thanks to Bob Hawkins who did the repair work.    Wish me God Luck I start renal treatments Monday.    Even in times of trouble and hurry God gives us peace.  Thank you God

        I always hated Kidney Beans and mom put them in everything.  First time I thought about the word kidney.    Kidney is a word constantly on my mind now. Renal failure.  Have been hearing this for years but didn't want to hear the diagnosis. Wimp!    As a result of all the health issus I try to remain focused on positives but spend time here dealing with the negative also.    The way this affects my outlook.  I ahve tried to ignore it in the past hoping the problems would disappear.  I have prayed for healing and tried to act like I have been healed as if God would make it so.  In this time I finally accept or submit to my health and physical problems without accepting a bad attitude (most of the time).    I always heard about submission to God's WIll and thought this was something other than what I am seeing now.    If you ever get the chance to hear about or read about Dietrich Bonhoffer, do it.  His work has inspired my life.  Bonhoffer was born around 1900 and became a professor in Berlin in 1930.  He was in the movement to stop the Nazis and he suffered for it.  His book, The Cost of discipleship, is a study of what being a disciple of Christ is worth.  Bonhoffer was a traitor to the Nazis but leaves a legacy to those that remember his sacrifice for Christ.  Bonhoffer was hung in 1945 by the Nazis.  His letetrs to and from from his wife, his assistant, and otehrs have been published.   Like an old friend sued to say "If it was easy women and kids would be doing it."  Bonhoffer felt that being a disciple of Christ , even at great cost, dire cost, was not something for the faithful only, it was for everyone.  We are all called to be Disciples.  We are all called , and predestined, to be children of God.  Many are chosen, only few accept.  If you have a calling to be more like Christ, act on it now.  The daily struggles of being Jesus to those He came to save is not a drudgery or boring job.  It can be exciting, exilirating. Most of all it is rewarding.  If Bonhoffer can face the Holacost then I can face the kidney Nazis.

        Thank God for the great Sunday.  I got to spend a little of the morning with the whole family, then Jennifer worked.    Went to Brandywine with the family, early service, then Jen was off to work.    We got to see her for supper in the afternoon.  I spent the day with the kids.  They sure can suck the energy right out of you.    Thank God for naps.       Time Displacement Theory      Why do we have so little time now?    When you are 5 years old a year is one fifth of your life.    When you are 50 years old a year is only one fiftyith of your life.    So, at age 1 or two you can measure days in percentages of your life that are larger than what they are at 30, 40, 50.    This should leave the conclusion if you need to get something done, do it now before you get older.  For fathers - this is why those early years are so important.  A few hours with your child seems like a real long time to them but only a whisper fo time to you.  Thanks to our heavenly father for his gift.

          FEAR is a human emotion.  We are made in the likeness of God.  God's physical likeness?  His spiritual likeness?  His emotions?   Yes  I have several passages marked in my NIV study bible.  All talk about the Holy Spirit.  It is easy to  say  trust in The Lord.  It is easy to  say  I Trust The Lord.  Many people hide their true self.  It's easier to hide self than it is to let down your guard to other people.  This is human nature.    I never wanted anyone to know my weaknesses.  I never wanted anyone to see the real me.  The reasons - many.  In the words of the culture we live in, I stunk.  Spiritually, I didn't want anyone to see or know. PRIDE  My spiritual failures showed weakness.  Why did I change, how did I change?  It took years for Christ to conform me.  If I had other Christians who could have shared their struggles with me it would have made it easier for me to give that up.    I'm perfect now, never have any problems. hahahahaha  Still a problem in this area.  Trust in the Lord with all of your Heart, Lean not on your own understanding.  It is still tough.  Now when I ahve problems I have people to talk to.   Who do I talk to?  Pastor Mark Martin at SMDCOG, Bob Tannehil, a Christian Counselor at Brandywine Community Church, Father Severin at St. Micahels, Chris Williams my prayer partner, Jennifer, my wife, Brink , my son.    What did it take to decide I would allow submission? Death.  When my brother died at 37 I had an epiphany. My eyes were opened.  I realized that I had outlived my younger brother. We had the same diseases.  I was older.  Why wasn't I dead too?  Why hadn't I died earlier?  I began to see that life was short, we are only here for a time.    When I used to give any project a "long run" look, "here's how this turns out in the long run," my Jewish friend corrected me.  "In the long run we die."  Is this wisdom of God?  Yes.  We have learned that our journey through life is like that of a traveler in a foreign land.  My FEAR of death is less than it was and my concern about how people saw me was less also.  Do I care?  Yes.  Now I care enough to be honest.  For years I hid my sickness and tried to pretend it didn't exist.  Now I tend to let the walls fall.  If I die today will I have done all God wants me to do?  No.  Am I ready to die?  Yes.  I like the Gene Rodenberry series Star Trek.  The Klingons are soooo cool. They don't fear death, they only fear one thing, dishonor. We could start a Vacation Bible School program based on the Klingons.  They always say before a big battle, "today is a good day to die."  Today is a good day to die for the Lord.  Any misgivings if I die today?  Not nearly enough time with Brink, Brook, Asa, and Jennifer.  Not enough time with Alexis and Lorraine, Mom/Frank, Dad/Judy.  Not enough time with Andrew. Not enough time to reconcile with L.   Not enough time for a last conversation with everyone I know, or everyone I want to minister to.  My reconciliation project at church.  My battles for all things good or for some things just okay.  Not enough time to see projects finished or people reaching their personal goals.  Sins and healing.  I have been dealing with this big time.  When Jesus healed he did ask which was easier, to forgive sin or to say "get up and walk." His purpose was to leave no doubt he was God on earth, that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sin.     God has given me my illness to bring me closer to him.  I can accept this and I can accept the way he has done this.  I would have preferred another way but what worked for Saul doesn't work for everyone.    You also have to remember that God only deals with people in miraculous ways if they are magnificently awful.  Saul.  How many Christians did he kill before receiving the Light (Christ Jesus) on the road to Damascus?  The miracle stopped a deadly man and made him a warrior for Christ.  If you have a relationship with Christ remember he is more than just a friend.    He accepts your problems while working on them.  Thomas doubted and Christ didn't exclude him or chastise him.  The road to Christ like any road is filled with adventure and obstacles.  Most important is making the journey.  Be filled with Joy, He loves you and wants only thes best for his chosen people.

        When I have been filled with The Holy Spirit I sometimes feel a warm sensation, a good feeling.    Someone reminded me today of what the Holy Spirit can do when you need Counseling, or guidance.  Christ told us he would send us a Counselor in the form of The Holy Spirit.    This person was upset about not being able to follow The Spirit and the guidance of Jesus and felt bad about this.    I wanted to be able to say, "It's okay, this shows you are growing, when you can admit it isn't easy."    I often hear about people playing church and make references to this sometimes.  Playing church is telling the world you trust God but not really trusing Him in your heart. Inner conflict is a sign you are not playing church.  This is life.  I see how some can beleive we are in Hell now and looking for salvation.  Life is not easy, it is not a walk in the Park.    We have brothers and sisters in Christ to guide us.  We also have The Holy Spirit.    Someone called this The Nagging Voice.  I have been told that to make fun of The Holy Spirit is not good but when we do things we aren't supposed to do how does the call of The Holy Spirit sound to us on earth?    I love my mother but when she corrected me in younger years all I heard was a nagging voice. I despised her and my father at times.  Did they throw me out with the trash, no.  I grew up, and as I get older my parents are less stupid than they were when I was 10.  I say this from a 10 year old's perspective.  The older I get the more wise my parents seem to be, why was I so stupid as not to listen?    God must understand this, He has dealt with it so many times.  Moses spent years in the desert until God transformed His Will. Saul was the world's msot prolific mass murderer, killing Christians in hate.  God transformed him by blinding him, yes.  The next 10 years or so were spent learnign before he , now Paul, could do the works God planned for Him.    Can you argue with The Holy Spirit?  Yes, you can.  The Holy Spirit calls all of us to serve God.  Not everyone responds.    Arguing with The Holy Spirit is an everyday occurance but I don't hear many Christians talk about this.  Lets just hide this so no one knows about me. Denying the Holy Spirit working to transform you is human pride.    After getting this note I felt the need to say I have argued with my Cousnelor many times.  Sometimes I outright ignored Him and did what I wanted.  My will over His.    Outside they would use every Bible quote about Ye of little Faith to torture me.    For those that can't let others see the pain that goes with conforming to the Will of Jesus, you need to open up.  How will new Christians handle this conflict if they are told this is easy.  I have been told by some that the transformation to Christ is immediate and complete. The Holy Spirit in me warms me with the Spirit of discernment on this subject. No loving God would deny his child for disobedience or for failing in training. Some may be transformed immediately.  My Hero mass murderer Saul stopped killing Christians but spent years discerning God's Will before moving on to evangelizing.  God created us in His image and our emotions are shared by God.  This helps us understand Him and also allows us to confuse ourselves.         Some people have humanized the Holy Spirit and say they have a conscience.  I know my conscience and The Holy Spirit are the same.  How do I know?  Only through ignoring The Spirit and doing what I would.    If you are a Christian will you admit, as another did to me, and I to you, that you have denied God's Will for your life?    At 12 I wanted to enter the minsitry.  I held this inside like a bad apple that had rotted for many years, justifying, but not fully accepting that I had turned from God and His Will.    How did I finally face up to this?  God made me see His Will.  Did I accept it all at once?  No.  I changed my mind but the nagging voice that I despised, but now love was always there when I went the wrong way.    How can I describe this conflict with my limited mind and vocabulary?  It hurt like hell sometimes.    God used soem very tough times to turn me sround.  I created my own world, my own wealth, to ignore His will.    In January I spent an hour in an argument with God.  "What do you want me to do?" I'll talk more about this later?  Immediate answer though.  He showed me my sight, which ahd been too bad to drive, couldn't be ignored any longer.  My strokes, my health, while a pain inn the but, are all answers to my request and ulitmately God's Will.    I hope this offers some message..."you are not in this alone"

      Apologies for no post today.  I am in the process of having additional testing done and have not been in the energetic state.  I was reminded by email I had not posted so I suppose I was predestined to post because I have....     I have posted before about predestination.  There are some who believe that we should not evangelize. "We don't need to do this work because the sinners are predestined for Hell and the saints are predestined for heaven."    For someone trying to be "on fire" for Christ this was the ultimate Buzz kill.  In the Thompson Chain Reference Bible I use - NIV today - there are several references to Predestination.  These do not fully explain the aspect of predestination I spoke of but give us as Christians some Hope.  Romans 8:29  For those God knew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son.   Let's see, He knew us in the womb, decided we should be predestined to be like his son.  This passage doesn't say that any are predestined to live a life in Hell.  Romans 8:30  And those He predestined, He also called: Those He called, He also justified, Those He justified He also Glorified.  I have to find the passage and let's see Matthew 28.  In the United Stated each President has a plan for our country which has a name or a symolic statement to declare what will be done.  With Roosevelt it was "The New Deal."  Christ had a platform for the future and it takes up only a few verses in the last book of Matthew. I'm always gripy with people who do something and have no plan.  Or people who compalin but have no resolution.  Christ has a tailor made plan for me and you. 4 verses starting at Matthew 28:16   The Great Commission     "Go and make disciples of all nations baptising them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."   Christ then calls ALL, not just the guy who wears an expensive suit or the wholesome prim and proper lady with nice dress and matching accessories.  Christ didn't say kill those blasphemers who are in denomination x.  He called us ALL to be Holy Priests and to be ONE church.  Christ didn't know how to turn man's soul off or make us less on fire.  People tend to do this.  The next time someone tells you about predestination remember the Great Commission.  You don't have to memorize the whole Bible to find what Christ expected of us. Short, Sweet, no program you need to emmorize.  We are ALL predestined to be followers of Jesus Christ.  Lord Have Mercy.  Christ Have Mercy.  Lift Up Our Hearts.  Pray for Donna and others on way or back from Chicago.  I am healed in the name of the Lord.

        Henry County, Indiana Message Board     Re : Questioning Christianity    You miss the point in several areas. You Say:  The Bible was written by humans for humans and is nothing more that that.   The Bible is not written by man but is the inspired Word of God, given to men.  Men wrote the Bible or the canonized works of the Bible with the influence and inspiration of God.  While the men of the day used, as Jesus did, parables to explain how God works, or used their culture to explain the works of God, the writings are as timeless today as they were then.  This is why We believe that the Bible is an unerring, non contradicting , work of God, not men. Each book contains either a Commandment or Command, a Promise, or a Lesson or teaching, or all of the above.  You Say:  It is quite peculiar that those who profess to be Christians only practice their faith within their "comfort zone" of belief.    Some churches argue these people are not Christians or alternatively are saved but not along the path.  In a journey of 1,000 miles you start with a single step. Some are a foot along, some are nearing the end.  Christ called all men to follow him and be fishers of men. Those that do this are viewed by our world as lunatics or fanatics. We are all called to be Holy Priests of Jesus Christ. This means leaving our comfort zones. This means loving the unloved and those who are not popular. This is hard for many to do.  You say :  Read the Bible, but understand it  within the context it was written. Do the same with scientific literature. Make any decisions on fact, evidence and truth.    The truth is outlined in the Bible and the miracles Christ did are historically documented. There is no one who has ever provided evidence that the 5000 were not fed, that Lazuras did not rise, or that Christ did not rise.  Because of the practice of emporer worship Pilate had the tomb of Christ guarded by Roman troops. He didn't want the followers to take the body and claim Christ had risen to heaven.  The troops ran when the army of angels took Christ.  The man public meetings Christ had after his resurrection are well documented and contain many people who knew Christ but did not beleive His teachings.  Fact, and documentation never disputed.  Hundreds saw his ascension to heaven, including non believers.  Free Will is our ability to deny God and his works even though he created us.  If you have children it might make this easier to udnerstand.  He loves us even though we killed his son.  The problem is that we are created in God's image but we are not God. We do not posess his intellect or understanding. Some things we can only understand in death.  You have to be willing to become submissive to God and deny your own faulty thinking.  Scientists and New Age beleivers cannot still create a human unless stealing parts from God's creation.   The chances we evolved are less than winning Powerball. No one can determine the how or why this happened scientifically, and will not.  Can you?

      Matthew 5 5 St Joeseph Edition  When he entered Capernaum acenturion approached him and appealed to him, saying, "Lord my servant is paralyzed, suffering dreadfully."  He said to him, "I will come and cure him."  The centurion said "Lord I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof: only say the word and my servant will be healed.  For I too am a person subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me.  And I say to one, "Go" and he goes; and to another "Come here" and he comes; and to my slave "Do This" and he does it."   When Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those following Him, "Amen, I say unto you, in no one in Isreal have I found such faith."  At that hour the Centurion's servant was healed.  A "roman" did not associate with a Jew and likewise Jews despised and did not associate with romans.  This is a great miracle in that Christ performed a miracle for one of the unclean as seen by the Pharisees.  The Centurion didn't follow the Laws of Moses so was unclean and not worthy of a hello or even an acknowledgement.  The centurion, despite the way submission to a Jew appeared to others, had faith that Christ could heal his servant.  Lord, I am in submission to you today.  You have said "Go" and I have gone.  You have said "Come here" and I have come. You have said "do this" and I have.  Please make me a man after Your Heart.  Help me to be more like You and less like me.  Heal me if it is Your will, Lord.  Allow me to pass Your Love to my family, my friends, and those whom I come into contact with on a daily basis.  Help me to follow You Laws not to be Legalistic but to be a Taladim of what You teach.  Be with Donna and others travelling to Chicago to the Benny Hinn revival.  Blessed Be your Name

        I update sometimes on my health and I suppose I have had enough time to think about this before making a post.  I started this blog as a way to handle my health and issues surrounding it.     I went to a Nephrologist last week.  This is a kidney doctor.  Prior to getting into IU for a hopeful kidney or pancreas transplant I needed to get a diagnosis on my kidneys.    When you know something in your heart and in your mind do you need a diagnosis?  I knew what I would hear because I ahev seen my kidney test results for the past years.  It was bliss to not have "the diagnosis" over me like a curse of some type.    This is like swimming in the lake hoping there are no alligators when you know they are there.     The diagnosis :  Chronic Renal Failure.     I am going to die.  But when?  My brother died at 37, two years ago.  I always loved beating him at things when we were young. I hate beating him at life.  I didn't ever want to see Steve buried.  I didn't want to carry the casket.  I didn't want to have to find a tie for him to be buried in, deal with the cries of my mother and Steve's children.   At 43, 44 this year I will have 7 years on Steve. I know in my heart Steve is in HEaven.  The last years of his life were a storm but he died with the peace of Christ.   Steve demonstrated in so many ways he was ready to die.  He made preparations for his death.    I was ready to die last year.  I even visited my father in Florida. A healing service was held for me at church and while my body was not healed I felt my Spirit was healed.    I need to accept my health but I don't need to accept death.  It is difficult to take the blood draws, the needle pokes, the pills, the complacency of the health care industry.  This does not include most of my doctors.    I tried then to fight my health and do more than I could.  Jennifer tried to help me.  She gave me something to do and always someone to supervise me. After several accidents and near misses I had to stop driving.  My eye doctor asked in January who drove me to his office.  I had to tell him I did and he suggested I have someone pick me up. After the last mini stroke I accepted my health and my condition.    I am in counseling, which can be a good or bad thing.  Bob Tannehill is my counselor, among others, at Brandywine Church.    I spent enough years in marriage counseling to know that it only works for someone who wants to change a habit or problem.  I did , she didn't.    Most counselors with big degrees have more problems themselves than their patients.  The Occupation with the highest suicide rate is psychology or counseling.    Most of these counselors have the new age view that man is a god and in control of his own universe.  God was not in the equation.  This makes a big difference.    Bob is a Godly counselor, basing his counseling on the Bible.     I enjoy these sessions and learning more about God and his plan for my life.    I know that God wants me to watch over my children and be there for them even if I am a shadow of what I used to be. I feel bad that I am not working or being productive financially. I hate placing the financial burden on Jennifer.  I haven't been able to handle the stress of fiannces or bills for many years now.    Then only thing in my life that I feel I can do i what I am doing...being with my kids, going to church, trying to squeeze what is left out of this useless body.  Any time I give to God or His ministry is gravy and makes me feel useful. The satisfaction gives me some worth in the worthless body.    If I get some new parts and can push awhile longer, I will be glad and thankful  for this.  I feel the need to see my children grow up and become adults.    God Bless my family and be with them in whatever they do. Let me be more like You and less like me.

      Mark Tabb spoke at Brandywine Community Church Today.    I normally spend Sunday mornings at South Memorial Drive Church Of God In New Castle.  Because of health and my inability to drive because of my sight I went with a friend to Brandywine. Jen worked today.  I like to go to Mass at St Michaels at least once each week.    I had heard about Mark.  Was Mark as exciting as Zig Ziglar?  Well, no. This isn't to say he wasn't exciting. He didn't spend the first hour of his presentation warming up the audience either...    I can say I felt The Spirit and had the discernment that I was hearing something I hadn't heard in awhile. Mark's words didn't need to make a change in me because I knew what he was preaching and find the message lacking today.  It places you out of your comfort zone.    Meat.  No potatoes, no garnish, no palate cleanser, just meat.  This is like going to McDonalds, expecting a Big Mac, and getting a Choice cut from an expensive steakhouse.    What I always tell people is what Mark preached this morning.      Some Christians spend their lives after finding Him with a view of a pastel world with flowers and butterflies.  This is good for the first week guys but you need to move on. This isn't the world we live in.    Mark got it, he got it. My belief that this is possibly the last day of my life is shared by Mark.    He outlined the stuff that takes up our time while we should be doing God's work.  He gave the group an outline of the things we waste time on.    Mark didn't environmentalise his message or water it down.  He used scripture.  He applied The Word to our world.    I felt moved emotionally, and more importantly mentally. Let's see, what are the usual compalints about a service...Music's too loud, too contemporary.  The things I enjoy in a service.    Mark Wright sang with his wife Kathy I hope. I only met a few people I knew but that is okay too.    Brandywine has an 8:30am and 10:00am worship service.  Babysitting, Children's Church.  No offering ceremony.  Just like the Chinese Buffet next door, you pay on the way out. Saw this in the bulletin and finally mvoed after I sqw I was blocking the box.    I have listened to his message twice on CD today.  It will air next Sunday at 8:30am on WJCF 88.1 if you would like to hear it.

Re: A roguish elf Posted by Marty on 6/13/2004, 9:48 pm, in reply to "Re: A roguish elf"  Is This the Love you posted about? Is this how nature demonstrates Love?

      A post from a Community Discussion Board.  It's all about Love and Hate.  Can you listen to this message and not respond?  Entitled A Rogish Elf  Among all the embodied nature forces there is one who reigns supreme; his name is love. Oh he is such a roguish elf! he steals into mens hearts and pours out such sweetness. HE seldom talks but just expresses himself in a mystic language known only to the heart. Have you met him child of earth? or have you met only his half brother who talks and talks untill you are weary of his chatter? Yes, and betimes he grows so eloquant with his own glowing word that he forgets others and remembers only himself. Poor thing! Then he suffers and cries out at the gross blindness and inhumanity of the children of men. Have you met him? you will know him from his brother, because his brother,Love, seldom speaks when you meet him. He gazes with a smile in your eyes with a starry misty shine in his eyes but for a moment but the shine lights your heart all the day through.    Posted by Marty on 6/13/2004, 9:29 pm, in reply to "A roguish elf"   Christ is Love. not an elf. His Light shines eternal, not just for a day.   Children of God hear his voice and bow to the only God. He is closer than a brother. Children of God have an eternal birthright that they only need accept now.  Children of earth have no birthright except dirt that blows like dust in the wind.  Capitalization of He is typically reserved for God Or Christ.  He is The Word made flesh and He speaks eloquently through His Holy Word, the Bible.   He send his Holy Spirit, the Great Counselor, to be with you in discernment, and to speak to your heart, always, if you listen. In the quiet when no one else is near, in the din when you are alone with 10,000.  He sends His followers to guide you and to keep you from false spirits and unwise teaching.  If another speaks to your heart it is a false spirit and your discernment should spit it out.  His nemesis is satan and his (non cap) followers. satan is not his brother.  God built the universe, the universe didn't create itself. Give thanks to God who created our world and who created us.  When you face your final day will you have comfort in nature as your body rots in the grave...  or will you have comfort in Christ who died so we can live, forever?  If you choose to accept Christ, pray this simple prayer: Father forgive me of my sins. Thank You for the sacrifice of Your Son Jesus who died on the cross to save our souls. I ask that You come into my heart with the Holy Spirit to guide me forever. In Jesus name, Amen.  Find a local church, follow in Baptism.  God Speed

        I have two sets of families.  One set of children were not sent to a school where Faith based education was taught.  After seeing the outcome I am glad that my wife has sent our younger children to a school where Christ is in the classroom, literally.    My older daughter attended a public school and during high school went to Germany. I was against this.  She learned to drink like a good German and hate America for it's backward stance on drinking.  Her Faith in Christ I am told is gone. A few of her teachers loved Christ, I know.  They wern't able to share it.  She typically takes the Lord's name in vain.  She was never taught this at home.  She takes for granted that Christ is her perosnal Savior.  I continue to pray for her.    My oldest Son has other problems.  A common theme I see is a lack of intelligence from his teachers and administrators when it comes to Christ.  Not acccepted, not allowed. I pray for Him daily and try to work with him.    We wanted to find a good Christian school for my younger Son because of many reasons.  All of them I won't share here. Pray for him.    We found that the only CHristian school available was a Catholic School.  My Southern Baptist upbringing left me somewhat questioning this decision but we found the Holy Spirit and discernment were both in this school and in it's teachers.    In every room the crucifix was displayed. Catholics know Christ is of the Cross and our risen Savior but this reminds them and me of His great sacrifice.    I am not proud to say but happy to say we are a part of the church family and have found believers in Christ who have a personal relationship with Christ at this church.    After having personal experience I believe the Southern Baptist Convention may be going somewhere with their latest proposal.   SBC's Leader Doubts Anti-Public School Proposal Will Pass -- Meanwhile, Dobson Agrees With Resolution But Says It May Be "Over-broad" By Jim Brown and Allie Martin June 11, 2004  (AgapePress) - The president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest evangelical denomination in the U.S., says he cannot support a proposed resolution that calls for members to remove their children from public schools -- a resolution that one prominent family expert supports, up to a point.  The proposed resolution, written by T.C. Pinckney of Virginia and Bruce Short of Texas, calls upon Southern Baptists to remove their children from government schools and ensure that they receive a Christian education. The 910-word draft has been forwarded to a committee that will decide whether it will be presented for debate during the denomination's annual meeting next week in Indianapolis.  But Dr. Jack Graham, president of the SBC, has reservations about the proposed resolution. He feels certain that some of its present wording will make it difficult, if not impossible to pass, and cites for example its suggestion "that families that send their children to public schools are acting in a sinful manner. Those kinds of words would not be a part of a [successful] resolution of the Southern Baptists."   Although Graham has supported the creation of more Christian schools, he says he cannot endorse the resolution as it now stands. "While we support Christian education -- we have a Christian school here at our church, and I've been banging the drum to start Southern Baptist kingdom education kinds of schools all across America -- I personally would not favor resolving in any way to remove our children from public schools," he says.   Instead, the SBC president emphasizes that Christians can and do play a part in positively influencing public education. "We have many public school teachers and coaches and administrators who are very active in our churches," Graham notes, adding, "We're training our young people to be salt and light in our communities, and many of these will be teaching in the public schools."  Family expert gives qualified support  The founder and chairman of Focus on the Family has also come short of fully endorsing the resolution urging all Southern Baptists to pull their children out of public schools; however, he says leaving government schools is the best move in most cases.  Although Dr. James Dobson says parents should remove their children from public schools in liberal states like California and Massachusetts, where homosexual propaganda and safe-sex ideology are taught on all levels, he says some states' educational systems are not as contrary to Judeo-Christian values. In those cases, he says the proposed Southern Baptist resolution may be a little "over-broad."  The pro-family leader strongly disagrees, however, with those who believe young people should be left in public schools so they can be salt and light in an environment of values contrary to their faith. "We're not talking about adults here," he points out, "going into the world and trying to minister to those who are wicked. We're talking about putting our kids under the leadership of people who disagree with everything you believe and stand for, and are working to undermine your belief system. And we're going to let our kids be the ones that are going to try to change that?"  In all circumstances, the Focus on the Family spokesman says, parents need to monitor everything being taught to their children because the public education system as a whole is antithetical to Christianity and, more often than not, is failing America's children academically and morally. He feels parents who rationalize leaving their children in public schools for missions reasons may need to rethink their theological position. "  "We're going to send our kids into Sodom and Gomorrah and hope that they'll change the system, minister to the system? I think that's our job as adults," Dobson says, "not a child's job, especially when they're very vulnerable -- junior high and high school. You get your kids into Sodom and Gomorrah, you just might not be able to get them out."  The pro-family leader suggests that in many cases the best way for Christians to influence the public schools may be by pulling their youngsters out of them. Dobson says if schools knew they could not keep children in the public education system while insulting the Christian faith and forcing students to read perverse literature, then everyone would see a dramatic change in America's classrooms.

        Why are there so many conflicts?    I have some friends who believe every conflict is a God vs Satan thing.  Can't Christians disagree without it being a Good vs Evil conflict?    Two Godly people, both who have an unblemished reputation disagree.  Both have convictions that they believe in and are on bedrock in their faith but both feel the other is wrong.    This usually ends up in Christian Brothers and Sisters taking sides on whatever issue.  At one church it was red carpet vs green carpet.    If you take this to the comparison at the beginning, was it God or satan that wanted the red carpet? Clearly this is an area where no one is wrong or right.    As people we take sides.  Common and normal for us to be able to opinionate on something.    When one "side" wins and we get red carpet, why does the other "side" leave the church or feel disinfranchised?    More importantly, how do you resolve the problem or reconcile one side of the church to the other when this takes place?    I am battling this problem now.  The conflict, while deeper than red or green carpet, can be broken down to a problem where there are sides.    For those not directly in the conflict, friends of both sides, how do you get one side to see the other?    In some conflicts among Christians there is a need to justify one's actions. Red is the color of the blood Christ shed for us, so we are called to have red carpet.    In some cases there is a need to show our brother or sister we are free from blame or sinless.  Have I sinned against you because I wanted red carpet?  Can you tell me how I sinned against you because I wanted red carpet?    Thre are ways to resolve conflict outlined I think in Matthew.  Go and speak with your brother.  If this doesn't work, go and speak with the elders.    This doesn't mean go and gossip with the elders.  It doesn't mean you should let the conflict grow by doing nothing.    Usually Christians are content with the final resolution, treat your former brother as a Pagan.  How did  Christ  feel about Legalism?   He was always causing trouble for those in the Church in his day who followed the Rules ...for the sake of the Rules and their own exaltation and not for the advancement of the Church of God.    The bottom line...conflicts involve hurt feelings.  We are created in God's image.  Does God have his feelings hurt? Does God get angry?  Does God get jealous?  Yes to all.  If you don't believe this, look at the Old Testament.    Can we come together, leave our predisposition to conflict out of this, and reconcile?    A good man said that some people will never like you.  Christ said to Love One Another.    Bringing the two sides together means they must eventually be of one accord.  How do you get a group of brothers and sisters together as one to work with the two to resolve the problem?    How do we resolve the hurt feelings?

      They walked in tandem, each of the ninety-three students  filing into the already crowded auditorium. With rich maroon gowns flowing and the traditional caps, they looked almost as grown up as they felt.   Dads swallowed hard behind broad smiles, and moms freely brushed away tears. This class would not pray during the commencements ----- not by choice but because of a recent court ruling prohibiting it. The principal and several students were careful to stay within the guidelines allowed by the ruling.      They gave inspirational and challenging speeches, but no  one mentioned divine guidance and no one asked for blessings on the graduates or their families.   The speeches were nice, but they were routine......until  the final speech received a standing ovation.   A solitary student walked proudly to the microphone He  stood still and silent for just a moment, and then, it happened. All 92 students, every single one of them, suddenly SNEEZED!!!! The student on stage simply looked at the audience and said, "GOD BLESS YOU, each and every one of you!"   And he walked off stage...    The audience exploded into applause. The graduating class  found a unique way to invoke God's blessing on their future with or without the court's approval. Isn't this a wonderful story? Pass it on to all your friends..and GOD BLESS YOU!!!!  In God We Trust, United We Stand.      Whatever this day may bring, remember God is always the same. Isaiah 46:9

      I couldn't help but share this.   A couple had two little boys who were always getting into trouble. Their parents knew that if any mischief occurred in their village, their sons were probably involved. The boys' mother heard that an elder in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her sons.   The elder agreed, but asked to see them separately. So, the mother sent her youngest son first, in the morning. The elder, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the boy down and asked him sternly, "Where is God?" The boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response. So the elder repeated the  question in an even sterner tone, "Where is God!" Again the wide-eyed boy made no attempt to answer. The elder raised his voice and bellowed, "WHERE IS GOD!" The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into a closet, slamming the door behind him.   When his older brother found him hiding, he asked, "What happened?" The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, "We are in BIG trouble this time. God is missing, and they think WE did it!"

      Just a quick note, I keep hearing about more people who were saved at FaithFest.  These are people who were LOST and now are SAVED.  At times we had a rather large crowd.  Thanks to Dale, Debbie, Eva, Kevin, Donna, everyone who was at FaithFest.

       Please be in Prayer for those who are in Pendleton Reformatory.  The Prison is on lockdown because of threats of a riot or escape attempt.  There apparently were shanks or homemade knives found in some inmates cells.  Ultimately this makes the Prison safer than it was before.  The down side is everyone is punished for what a few did.  A Letter to an inmate at Pendleton.    While you haven't said until recently that the lockdown is taking place we have been following these events over the past month from brothers and sisters who are involved in the ministry at Pendleton.    Our Christian friends have not been able to enter the prison but we are trying to get them to use the radio for the ministry that was done in person before.  We are told your radios are still available and you indicate you listen.    We are waiting on the forms to be able to donate items (books, etc).  Apparently this is a process..    I must apologize for not writing more.  My health has been poor and getting the energy to do anything has been tough but this is just an excuse.  I should face this better than I have.    I admire your faith.  I understand it must be tough there to be able to worship God and have a relationship with Christ. We hope the radio gives you some encouragement.    We have been working on FaithFest and this has been a blessing.  We started out the day with only 7 people in a circle and annointed prayer.  We hope this day ends with a positive move to God from his people.    I am from Columbus myself and grew up in the Hope area.  I didn't have a Christian station to listen to.  I didn't have my heart in the church like I should have.  There wasn't much for people to do for God, and still isn't now.  Jennifer's idea of community service and serving God were new to me in the way she wanted to do it.  Now it is the only thing I live for.    Please let your brothers know that we will continue the ministry through the radio station.  Hopefully on Tuesday nights.    Another thing.  You have been so faithful in your support of the station.  On lockdown you can't even work now.  Please save your commisary money.  Your letters are so supportive.  Keep writing but save your funds so you can have the things you need.  As we work towards getting involved with the Pendleton Ministry we will trust you to help us know the needs of those inside so that we can deliver the ministry needs from the  inside.  Work with us in this regard.    We are sorry that the lockdown is taking place but understand that these things happen and everyone suffers because of a few.  We are asking for prayer for the officials, the guards, and those within the walls.  I hope that with the actions taken that you are in a safer place now than you were before.    God Bless you and our brothers in Christ in Pendleton.

        I haven't been able to do too much these days.  I plan on trying NOT to overdo it today.    We have a great group of people who have planned FaithFest. A free outreach to the community with many Christian bands and singers who are ministering to God's people.    Dale Garza has done a super job, and Eva , and Debbie, and others....    God Please Bless this day and use it to do your will.      Thank you if you have been a part of this and we will see you soon.  Marty

      Marty:      Your info. is appreciated and encouraging.  I will contact your friend.      I have attended different churches and not to be judgemental but was not sure what they were doing.  The worst one scared me and I prayed for God to get me out of there.  The people were nice but some special speaker was there and he said, I had unclean spirits and needed to be cast out.  This man screamed a lot and so did a lot of the people.      Something encouraging for you'  I know Jesus is alive-He visited me when I was in the hospital.  I have had many christians say He does not do this but I know what I know.  He told me many things and He looks like a real person except different than the pictures I have seen.  Maybe love, somehow I do not think Jesus can seperate Himself from this-it's who He is, if that makes sense.      You may not be perfect but the things you and your staff do, draw me because you are so much of Jesus.    Today was a beautiful day because I did picture my sins on the floor of the ocean.  I lived many years on the West coast so this image was easy to accept.  You would not know that but God does.  So much of Him-that's who I want to be.   In Christ,      Donna is a faithful woman who can counsel you and she is willing.  She volunteered after reading me talking about you as an anonymous person.     Some churches can scare you if you haven't been in that environment before.    I feel that might be judgement if I told someone that they had an unclean spirit. We are all sinners.  We can't label people this way I feel.     There are people that love God in many ways.  Some mainstream, some not.  Some churches they run up and down the aisles when they feel they have the Spirit. Some pray in unison, some pray loud even yelling, some pray laying on the floor, some speak in tounges.  I can't judge any of them but for a new Christian this might be scary.  I have deeply enjoyed being filled with the Spirit in this way myself.       There are some churches where emotion is not allowed at all.  You can't clap your hands or applaud, you can't sing praise music, it's believed disrespectful.  I don't like this type of service but some people do.     It really does involve going to many churches until you find a common Spirit.  You might go to a church where you only need to listen to the service until you can handle a wild ride like some of the "Holy Roller" churches if this freaks you out.     Several churches that are mainstream and preach the full gospel are :  Brandywine , Church of God  (Ingalls, Lawrence, South Memorial Drive in New Castle.),  Christ Fellowship Church Knightstown, Body Of Christ in Greenfield, and these are just to name a few.  I have enjoyed Mass at St Michaels in Greenfield.  I have been attending RCIA classes Roman Catholic Indoctrination for Adults as a part of my spiritual growth.  I have found the Catholic Faith to be as compatible with my beliefs as the Southern Baptist Convention or the Church Of God or the Lutheran Church.    Any church that allows you to receive a personal relationship with Christ and does not attempt to keep you from this relationship or cause you to receive clearly false teachings or statements is a healthy environment. There are good churches in every area...I don't know what area you are in but I encourage you to find a church family who will love you as Christ.       My son had a friend who went to church with him in another city. This was not a "full gospel" church where they display the fruits and gifts of the Spirit.  Rather laid back  and unemotional.  They might or might not stand up if the choir sings Stand Up For Jesus. This church invited people to come forward, he did,  and he was counseled by someone who claimed he had a bad spirit in him.  He was maybe 10 or 11 and it freaked him out.  He didn't want to go to church again.     New in the Spirit means you are like a child but learning. Find a place you can learn.  Read more in the New Terstament about discernment.  The Holy Spirit will guide you.     Talk to Donna also.  Donna is a good Christian woman who can help you.  Donna is also some kind of dancer.  She wears a hula skirt out in public, but, you'll have to get to know her.     Donna will be at FaithFest tomorrow at the 4H Fairgrounds.  11am to 8pm.  You may be able to meet some folks who can talk with you about these things.   You can meet Jennifer who runs the station and my extended family tomorrow also if you are able.  Ann will be there from the station, and others.   If this isn't enough, during tijmes of great trials it is good to speak to professional help....I do.  Doesn't mean I'm crazy but that I need help dealing with things I am thinking because of health and other issues I face.  A Christian Counselor I see now is Bob Tannehill at Brandywine Community Church.  Brandywine has a counseling program.  I see Bob for the trials I face and on how I should deal with them.  They charge based on the ability to pay.  I don't go to Brandywine but I feel like I am part of the congregation at this church and many others.     This is normally something your pastor will do at your home church.  I have also spoken with my pastor falso but I feel Bob has a good Spirit too.     Blessings

        I always enjoy reading Bill Robert's blog site.  It brought me up to speed today-   It’s a funny thing what one will think about when he can’t sleep…  I’m thinking about hell…  It seems like a whole lot of people know a whole lot more about hell than I do…which in the big picture of things…could be a very good thing.  In the NIV translation of the Bible, the word is only used 14 times. Destruction is used 17 times. Punishment in this context is used only 4 or 5 times. There are other words like darkness but again they are used rarely in this context.  Even though the word is used so rarely, we have made it the major point of our evangelistic thrust. “It’s Jesus or hell! You pick!” What kind of moron would pick hell? Would it really matter what word would precede the phrase “or hell?”  I just don’t see this being the point of New Testament preaching. It seems like the preaching was more like “Hey, God came to earth to show us what real life could be like. Would you like to learn how to live life like that?”  Don’t get me wrong. Hell is a real place…a really bad place. Jesus said that it would be better to have your eye plucked out or your arm cut off than to go there. But it just doesn’t seem to be the point of his message.  It seems to me that Jesus spent a whole lot more time telling us that we’re going to be really surprised by the people who end up there…like people who are stingy with material things, and people who prophesy and cast out demons, and who don’t take care of the least of his brothers.  My spiritual daughter hates hell so much that thinking about it can put her into a tailspin for days…sometimes months. She truly doesn’t want anyone to go there. I want to care for people like she does.  But…sorry. I can’t preach that Christianity is just a way to avoid hell. It isn’t. I’m afraid many who use the term Christian to describe themselves may find themselves there. “Our hope is built on nothing less, than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.”  posted by Bill    Marty Hensley said...   Bill,  I've never heard the message just like you put it here.  When I was growing up I was always told about the options....Heaven or hell. It's like a Saturday Night Live skit. I was more afraid of God because I was afraid of hell. The loving relationship was not emphasised.  Since I started blog I have a need to read a post from you every day. I'll admit I read your site and Donna and a few others every day BEFORE I do my devotional. When I don't see a post every day I miss it.  Regardless of what you post it always makes me think. Some days just the thoughts help me adjust attitude for the day. I always have to think though.  I am discovering there are many people who use a computer who have trouble with a normal church setting. Baggage from their church experience, past relationships, etc. keep them from a 4 walled church.  hell is a real place and we have to worry about it but if you have a loving relationship with Christ you will work towards this and not consume your life with worry. Why can't this message go out in churches everywhere?  God Speed  God,  Thank you for Jennifer.  She has been so good to me. Bless her and keep her safe.  Thank you for Brink, Brook, Asa, Andrew, and you know.  Thank you for friends like Toby and Nancy.  Jennifer and I ate supper with them last night and got some rest from the world.  Thank you for Pat and Joyce and Keith and Lauren.  We haven't been able to afford to have our poodle trimmed and Joyce cut her hair yesterday.  Joyce was upset she cut her short...she looks like the dog that got shaved on Austin Powers. I laughed and laughed, inside.  No harm, just a short haired poodle.  Thank you for Ann and John.  They do so much for us.  Thank you for Cindy and Ed, for our other family. Secret hand sign.  Thank you for fellowship yesterday with Mark Martin.  Bless Curt, Tami, their families, Don and Liz and their cute kids, Jennie and Bruce, Chris and Tina, Alan and Theresa (as Alan goes through tough times with family issues), Brett Paige and Samuel, Clyde and Nadine, Mike, Marjorie, and the others who minister.  Bless Father Severin, Dave, Jerry, and others we fellowship with.  Bless my father Ralph and Judy in Florida.  Bless my mother Linda, and Frank, Lorraine and Alexis.  Bless my brother Steve who is in your care now.  As Brook says, bless everyone in my heart.  Deal with my health in a supernatural way Lord. Deal with my adversity.  I trust this to you and your will.  Bless FaithFest tomorrow to your Glory.  Amen

      Jennifer received this email at the station.  I want to respond to encourage.  Any ideas.  Names have been deleted for anonymity.    WJCF Ministries:      Since the recent e-mail from a former friend I have been very upset.  Thank you for being so understanding.  I tried to find another link on the net to answer my question but many pages were no longer available.    My former friend who I did meet at a NA meeting claimed to only be trying to help, I felt betrayed because NA like AA is suppose to be confidential.    What is troubling me is the fact that I do not know how to be a Christian.  Jesus Christ did touch me in a powerful way several months ago.  I accepted His gift of grace, have been baptized and I was unable to work for several months so I read the entire Bible.  I have been unsuccessful finding a church I feel comfortable attending.  I do pray everyday and I know we are suppose to tithe so I give to many ministries.      I have been told that isolating is wrong and God does not isolate any Christian.  I see other Christians and all that they do and I would like to be able to be like them.  I don't know how this is done exactly.  I have searched the scriptures and I don't know what else I am suppose to do.  My former friend said, it is must be that I still love self more than Jesus.  My fear is that maybe this is true.    If I missed something in the Bible (much of it I didn't fully understand) could you please direct me.  Or if you know of some other place I could contact I would appreciate any help in this matter.    I will add your ministries to my list and try and be faithful in giving I still have many medical bills left to pay but I think I should put God first.   In Christ,   Dear     ,    Finding a relationship with Christ is what you ultimately want to find.  The only way you cna do this is with the help of the Holy Spirit, indwelling in you.   When Christ ascended into heaven He left a Counselor (The Holy Spirit) sent from the Father, a part of the Holy Trinity.    It helps to be a part of a supportive church or church community.  We are directed to be a part of ONE church, not 20 different churches, like the church has become.    Find a church where they don't look down their noses at you.  Look at Saul, who changed his name to Paul.  When he was transformed it didn't prepare him for ministry.  We are taught that it took 10 years before he was confident enough in his faith to begin evangelizing.  Don't expect a change overnight.  It happens with some, not with all.    Wherever you live, you can find a church to minister to your needs.  Need a singles group, find a church with a singles ministry.  Need more teaching, find a church that spends time teaching.  Wednesday night Bible classes, and other prayer study groups. Unless you find a connection you won't enjoy it and it won't sink in.  This sometimes involves looking.    You have a computer...go online to blogspot.com and write a journal about your experiences.  Share this with the other Christians, learn from them and grow with them.    No one is perfect except Christ.  He loves you more than a brother. Don't Despair.  I am not perfect...You will never be perfect... but Christ accepts me and  you now and he will change you just as he continues to change me.      If you have bills remember there is no debtors prison.  There is no requirement to support our station.  We know that God will provide and he has provided to keep the station on the air.    There are many good brothers and sisters waiting to help you through the trials you will face.  The song from Audio Adrenaline says it all,  In Ocean Floor Christ has taken our sin away and he has left it all on the Ocean Floor.   The biggest mountains and valleys are on the ocean floor.  So deep we have never visited them.  This is where your sins are. Your sin is behind you.  Christ has forgiven you.    We hope the station is encouraging for our listeners.  We know we are not perfect and not the best people to do what we do.  We trust that if we leave it up to Christ he can make a way where there is no way.    Leave your baggage on the Ocean Floor because Christ has placed it there.  Live a new day like may be your last day.  Forget the past and make the new and trust in CHrist and brothers and sisters in Christ to uplift you.  You aren't alone and shouldn't be alone in your struggle.    God Luck   Marty  Any internet sites I can direct this writer to???

      Here is a big discussion that has come up recently.    Verizon Wireless Music Center is holding a concert with Michael W. Smith , Mercy me and David Crowder Band.  The largest place to hold a concert here.   Some discussion has arisen that Coors Light has a contract with Verizon.  And I know every beverage vendor (alcohol provider) has a similar contract with Victory Field, Conseco, The RCA Dome, and others, I don't see the big deal.   Every Christian station is promoting the concert as a ministry event.  Every station was and is aware of the Coors Contract. I have several family members who haev died or who have had severe consequences due to drinking.  How many nights did my late grandparents spend arguing in a drunken state, while I was there, because a case of beer into 2 people only allows so much clear thought? My dad drank very infrequently.  Hardly a time I can remember when beer was in the hosue.  He did drink though.  Here is the exchange.  Do you have comments or feelings about this?      Am I a hypocrite because I see this as a great ministry event?     Comment Here is a reply to our one and only bad response to last months editorial about Coors. We did get several phone calls and emails on the good side (almost all from pastors and ministry leaders).  On to the Coors issue. There are several arguments to be made. One, the Bible clearly states in 2 Corinthians 6:14 “Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers” The company of Coors and Michael W. Smith would clearly create an unequal yoke. No, not because one sells alcohol and the other sings Christian music, but because Coors supports CLEARLY anti-Christian companies and beliefs with it’s profits and MWS professes to be a Christian. After some research on the Coors website we noticed that they are very proud of their support of the Gay community, among others.  Secondly, 3 John v.5-8 instructs us to not solicit money from the non-believers to finance the work of ministry. Your statement, “With the amount of dollars that any beer manufacturer wants to put out sponsoring a concert such as the great Michael W. Smith and MercyMe, hats off to ‘em!”, would probably be the opinion of many, even mine at one point. Why not use bad money to promote good? Because it is so clearly against the Biblical principal laid out in 3 John.  Thirdly, and probably most importantly, suppose there are people in the concert who were converted from a life of alcoholism. Doesn’t that make Smith and MercyMe a stumbling block to a weaker brother? In a large crowd there is no way to assure that is not the case, and most likely there are people who have an addictive personality. What a shame for their addiction to state because they attended a Christian concert. (that was a point made to me by a local pastor)  Mr. Michaels, I am sure that you would agree that the Bible clearly teaches that we are to hold ourselves above reproach. We have a responsibility to put Christ on us in the world. Consider the people that have to come and sell the beer to the Christian concert attendees (and beer will be sold at the concert, it has been confirmed). Many unsaved call us hypocrites. We tell them that certain “Lifestyles” are wrong, and they may not be able to discern between having a beer or glass of wine and a lifestyle of drinking. Where is the testimony of Christ in that?   I am not questioning MWS or MercyMe in their Christianity with this, just their choices. They both have riders (concert contracts) that state alcohol is NOT to be served at their concerts. I talked with the guys of MercyMe in late April about this very issue and they said that they were doing everything in their power to make sure that alcohol was not sold. IN MY OPINION...they could have cancelled the show if they truly did not want to have alcohol sold. In any other case, if I was bringing them in, they would refuse. So, why is it different? That is not a question you can answer, only they can. But, we all need to be held accountable for the poor decisions that we make. As Christian brothers, we have that responsibility. That was the reason you wrote me, right?   So, do I believe that drinking is a sin and that Christians should not? Not entirely. I believe that a lifestyle of over-drinking is a sin, and that the first taste, for some people, can be a very dangerous one. I do, however, believe that we are to abstain from all appearances of evil. What are the appearances if in one hand we hold a Coors Light while raising the other hand to the heavens in worship? Yes, worship! Not that entertainment is not a great part of the evening, however MWS is one of the greatest WORSHIP leaders I have ever had the chance to see. He, himself, will tell you that he hopes to have this be an evening of worship, as I am sure it will be. But let’s not forget the principle in Matthew 10:8 that states, “Freely you received; freely you must give”. But that is a discussion for a different time.  The love them less basically means that out of Christian love, they can't support them. They love them so much that they can't go.  Ministry and outreach would be going to the track, Indians games, and Ice Games where beer is sold and non-Christians will be. Then, we are on their turf and time.  But with this they are only advertising this in the Christian market (InTake, NUVO, Indy Men's Mag, etc ads for Coors Lite Concert Series have left off the MWSmith concert). If they are trying to reach "almost" Christians or people just hanging out at church, then they are going to give them the wrong message. If the secular world doesn't know about it, they won't come. Even if they do, I don't see them paying more to go hear the gospel than the other secular artists coming under Coors.  I do believe in ministry events. I do think it is ok to have Christian artists at bars or with the unsaved but like it or lump it, this is a Christian event brought to us by Coors with beer being sold there. This isn't about publicity...don't need that. I would hate for them not to come too but would like them to come back under other circumstances. The artists knows that they are coming because of Coors...they said it to us at the GMA's.  If this event was with a smaller known Christian artist, this wouldn't be an issue because everyone would be on their case. Third Day had major hassles with their GM sponsored tour (deal was made by the same people who made this deal). That was a gray issue for me...while GM is a secular company, they are at least family friendly and not harmful toward our Christian walk but it also states clearly in the Bible that we shouldn't take worldly money to do our ministry. It is much easier with a company like Coors. I love the guys in MercyMe. We have spoken with them many times but they have gone against their contract and I think their morals because of money. They were struggling with it at GMA's. Just think about how much money each night will flow in to them if the venue is almost sold out!!! Big temptation.  This is the hard part of doing a newspaper. People need to be informed of what is going on. I have sent out emails and called pastors about this from a few denominations and they have agreed 100% that beer shouldn't be sold at a pure Christian event being sold as worship or outreach.   Response For discussion only and not as a quoted comment:  I am not sure of the comment "I would love them less if I went to the concert" What does this mean exactly? What was the question?  This has been promoted as a night of ministry. Mercy Me and Michael W Smith are both respected artists who lead people to Christ.  There are secular Michael W Smith and MercyMe fans who may find Christ this night and WJCF is planning on being there to lead people to Christ.  While I am personally aligned with the Protestant and Catholic faith also I do not believe in alcohol consumption. Would not promote it. We do though promote giveaways at restaurants that serve alcohol.   Christ drank wine. The fermentation level is in question. It was a drink though that could make one drunk and he said don't be a drunkard. This is still applicable. The Bible is against drunkenness and not drinking.  Christ's first miracle was in turning water into wine. Coors basically sponsors x number of concerts at Verizon Wireless. This is a contract with Verizon. I understand that if you want to do a Barney concert during this block it becomes a Coors Light event.  There are people that get so fat on even this good food from a good company that they die due to related illnesses. The over use of ANYTHING is immoral. Alchohol, burgers, chicken, and so on.   It would be sad to see a positive outreach face opposition from Christians. Comment Just wanted you to know that we are working on a large story about the One Nation Tour. For most of you, you know my heart. This isn't out of anger or spite and especially not for publicity.  Most people don't know that the tour (at least this leg) is sponsored by Coors Lite. It is a part of the Coors Lite Concert Series. NOBODY knows that beer is to be sold there as well (we just confirmed that late last week with Verizon and Clear Channel). You might have been told differently by one person or two, but this is confirmed. We spoke to the guys of MercyMe down at the GMA's and they knew it. They were struggling with it but told us, "we aren't promoting beer, beer is promoting us." While it isn't a direct sponsorship (Coors didn't give the $65k directly to MWS & MercyMe) but it is still beer money that is bringing them and promoting them (Coors gives Verizon (ClearChannel) a total amount and then they bring in all the artists).  They first said it was outreach (Audio A. was true outreach at the 500 track) but then on the ads they call it a night of praise and worship and night of ministry. They are just advertising it to the Christian market as well. So, outreach it is not... One person has said they thought it was cool that MWS & MercyME was on Coors mind, but why would Coors do this? Is it an untapped market for them? Remember, this isn't a Christian company so their motives are NOT like ours.  This will lead to a lot of phone calls...for that I am sorry. Don't get me wrong, you don't have to take the ads off air and I am not saying that anyone who doesn't is bad or even wrong. You (and the other radio stations) have a contract to another Christian brother, Mike Clark, who the secular promoter has used to advertise to the Christian community. But it would make for an awesome story to add.  All of this is confirmed by many sources, including; Verizon Wireless, Clear Channel, MercyMe themselves, MWSmiths management, and more.  We just spoke to MWSmiths manager and we might be getting a call from him today or tomorrow. For the people who have been misled, they won't be able to get their money back unless the show is cancelled.  One minister called me last week and will be quoted "I would love them less if I went to the concert", meaning that there should be accountability amongst brothers in Christ.  Any thoughts?? And of course, all is off the record unless you say otherwise. We love the guys of MercyMe and their songs but they have had to go totally against their contract (rider) for this tour and only reason, it looks like to me, is for the money and that saddens me.  Hope all is well. I would love to set up a time for all of us to meet and to get to know each other more.  In HIM,    PS...if you want scriptures that supports this, let me know. The only argument so far from one person is that wine is in the Bible.   Response No beer sold and Coors banners covered night of the event. Here is an e-mail from Mike Clark and New Covenant Productions after I asked specifically.  You should pass this along to those who have been contacted probably. Also note that Christ's first miracle was turning water into wine. It is not simply that wine was mentioned in the Bible but the background of drunkenness vs. drinking.   Coment from Cocnert Promoter  Coors is not a sponsor of the tour. It may be a sponsor with Verizon. We have no control over that. I have done Sandi Patti( the first concert there) and Amy Grant at Verizon in the past. The tour may ask for the Coors banners to be covered and no alcohol to be sold that night. That is normally in the rider. Even if it is sold, none will buy it. This is a non-Christian building doing a Christian event. Could the event be a outreach to the employees of Verizon? This kind of discussion in media is a reason why non-Christians are puzzled by Christians.  Response That is nice that he has said that but he is just the liaison between somebody at Verizon and the Christian community. I am not here to argue. Artists management and the secular promoter and Clear Channel corporate have confirmed and along with the guys of MercyMe that "beer is promoting us". The fact of the matter is that Coors pays a certain amount to Clear Channel and then Clear Channel pays for the artists..meaning that Coors has brought MWSmith and MercyMe in. Any other Christian company has not paid money to bring in the artists...Coors Lite is the sponsor. You ask any of the secular artists and they know who the sponsor is, Coors.  An example: American Hunger Relief paid us and then we paid Bibleman to come in. Who was the sponsor? Us and American Hunger Relief. They didn't have to have Bibleman come...it was just a great fit.  The artists "can request" that the banners be covered and no alcohol is very different than it is guaranteed to be. I know as of this morning, Clear Channel corporate said that beer was to be sold. The guys of MercyMe said at GMA's that they hoped that beer wouldn't be sold but at that point, it was and they were trying to get it not to be.  As for Mike's comments about even if it is sold...none would buy, wow. I would hope that would be the case but there are no guarantees and it isn't a good argument. Mike did confirm that it is a Christian event. On all of the press releases, MWSmith says that it is a night of worship. Outreach to the employees, maybe, but then what is the most used argument that non-Christians have against Christians? That Christians are hypocritical! And what would the employees think if they sold us beer during one of our concerts? What damage to them and to baby Christians and teen Christians seeing this? Here lies most of the problem. If beer isn't sold that night then this part of the problem would go away.  As for the last statement he made "This kind of discussion in media is a reason why non-Christians are puzzled by Christians.", I think it is the opposite. His argument is why we look hypocritical. This is a slippery slope. If beer can promote a worship concert, then how about Christian radio and print? Where is the line drawn?  We are still talking with some people at Clear Channel and the artists management to figure it all out. We have to look into these things...if not, we are just a PR paper. We are also looking out for the Christian community.  How would you see it...you see an insert in Aprils Indy Star (Sunday edition) with images of MWSmith and MercyMe around Coors light ads saying that they are a part of the Coors Lite Summer Concert Series so then you ask them and they know it but don't know what to do about it but are trying to get beer not sold but would still break their rider if beer is to be sold, then you get confirmation at ClearChannel corporate that beer IS to be sold, MWSmith calls it a "night of worship" on all press releases, the concert only being advertised to the Christian community, but yet one person tells you that beer isn't to be sold and that banners will be covered... you wouldn't look into it? You wouldn't ask questions? You wouldn't try to find the truth? If beer isn't to be sold but yet Coors money has brought them in, what then? Response Coors has a contract with Verizon to be the exclusive beer of the Music Center.  I do not have any reason to believe they are promoting the show or contributing to the proceeeds to make this show happen.  No beer sold and Coors banners covered night of the event. Here is an e-mail from the promoter after I asked specifically.  You should pass this along to those who have been contacted probably. Also note that Christ's first miracle was turning water into wine. It is not simply that wine was mentioned in the Bible but the background of drunkenness vs. drinking.     Marty's Opinion  Good Bad or Ugly After much thought here is my opinion of the Clear Channel/Coors/Michael W Smith controversy. This is not the opinion of WJCF but my view personally:  Christ taught us to love our neighbors as he loved us. The mercy aspect was meant to outweigh legalism or "religion."  We all sin and fall short of the glory of God. Whether we kill someone or think bad thoughts about our neighbors both are in the same "he who is without sin cast the first stone" example of Christ.  I don't like homosexuality and have been a homophobe but am trying desperately to love homosexuals as Christ does. St. Lukes Church, where you have promoted concerts, has a gay night for gay christians. Should you place them under the same scrutiny as clear channel/verizon?  The Indians sell beer during Christian concerts at Victory Field. Should we discount the minsitry there?  Every Catholic Church serves wine at church events. I don't agree with this but believe there are Catholics who will be in heaven.  We are human. How did Christ's Disciples pick a replacement for Judas? Did they pick the most worthy person? They used a lottery to pick Judas replacement.  If Christ were here today the Bible shows where he would be. He wouldn't be in the Churches of the day trying to save those who had been saved. He would be hanging out with the lost. Prostitutes, Bikers (not with the CMA though or the Unchained Gang - they have the Spirit) , Drunkards, and the Homeless would be hanging with Jesus.  There have been only a few Christian events at Verizon Wireless. This is the biggest venue in the area. Why should we be denied it's use? We are not diluting our faith if we are loving and ministering to the least of these.  Marty

      &nbsp; Thursday  &nbsp; I had the chance to meet another new dcotor yesterday. Another new opinion.&nbsp; Yet another plan for health.&nbsp; Nice doctor, as are all of the doctors I see.  &nbsp; My die&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been slow.&nbsp; I have joined a new diet as of yesterday.&nbsp; This consists of 4 carnation instant breakfasts a day with skim milk. I can also have salad less cheese, meat, or&nbsp;normal salad dressing.  &nbsp; If I loose enough weight the transplant will go better.&nbsp; I need to loose weight anyway.  The diet is a path to the transplant.  &nbsp; Jennifer has had me on skim milk for some time now.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Whole milk is now somewhat chalky when I drink it.&nbsp; Where do they get skim cows anyway?&nbsp; Chocolate milk comes from chocolate cows, right?  &nbsp; Being with my family and friends has been a great blessing during this time.&nbsp; I look forward to more time with them if allowed.  God Bless You today!

       &nbsp; A New Day and new possibilities.&nbsp; We go to Church today.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Since I can't drive myself anymore I miss this flexibility.     &nbsp;   At this hour the house is quiet.&nbsp; No one stirring..but soon this will change.&nbsp; Yelling little voices and excited young minds rambunctious in their movements and thoughts.     &nbsp;   Dressing up for Church makes them excited.&nbsp; I hope they can be quiet in Church though.

        I went to McDonald's one time and asked for a Big Mac but they wouldn't give me one.  They said I really wanted a double cheeseburger.      A double cheeseburger is like a Big Mac as it has two patties.  But those two patties are right on top of each other and I don't like that.  Gross in my opinion.     I don't hate people who like those two patties together but I just don't want to be a part of that double cheeseburger "lifestyle".    Well, after an argument I was forced to take the double cheeseburger.  I was hungry so I had to eat it.  I suppose I could have gone to Arby's or Mancino's but I CHOSE to take the double cheeseburger and it's two patties slapped together lifestyle.    Well, I had been going to McDonalds so much that it was habit.  Like, McDonald's is my friend, they wouldn't ever harm me would they?  I've been with McDonalds forever, like my family.    Every time I go now they force me to have a double cheeseburger instead of a Big Mac and now I have been doing this so long it has become a habit.    Sometimes I think that this two patties slapped together lifestyle is okay and if I fool myself I can beleive that I am genetically designed to take only double cheeseburgers, even though I can remember a time, long ago, when this disgusted me.    My friend McDonald's though, has brought me up in a way to realise I am who I am and that is a two patties slapped together double cheeseburger lover.    Some people hate me because I am a doubler but they only wish to violate my right to free will or my civil rights.    I could have gone to Arby's.    Those Bigots!

      I have been on the New Castle Henry County message baord by EZ Look.  Becasue of the total disrespect for God I ahev posted.  Because they are so vehemnt in their dislike I received a post recently.     This message was 10 things Marty should admit.  This is my response.  Bzz,    Because I don't support your gay lifestyle or your Godless attitude makes me open to personal attacks for Him.  Any time we are chastised for His Sake we are blessed.  May God Bless you for this opportunity to witness for Him.  : 10. You should never believe anything unless  : you can prove it to yourself.   I fought God and lost.  I believe because I know.  :  9. If I told the TRUTH I'd be out of a job.   I don't have a job and I can tell the truth.  I have been unemployed for a number of years in end stage renal disease and a number of illnesses.  My life expectancy has been passed every year s.  I am 43.  :  8. Why do people thank God for saving them  : from disasters, but not for the disasters?  God doesn't set out to punish us unless we are disobediant. This is like saying, I tripped and fell and I blame God.  Blame yourself where the burden lies.  If the world trade center collapses this is a free will issue.  Wasn't designed by men for idiots with airplanes full of fuel.  Was only desinged to accept one hit by a 727, the biggest plane available when designed.   :  7. Of course I've never seen God. Have you?   I've never seen the smell of of the ocean.  I've never seen a midsummer's breeze which moves my hair.  I've never seen the God who created these but I know he lives.  To deny He exists is like denial of all I can't understand with my silly human mind.  :  6. Send your child to church early in life.   :    It's easier to manipulate his mind that  : way.   Choice and free will.  If you can't grasp this, and won't read the Bible with an open heart,watch Star Trek.  Rodenberry created a show which seems to me a parable.  God of course is rarely mentioned but He IS mentioned.  Several of the stories on free will and pre determination are relevant when considering your alternate lifestyle as a choice and not as a genetic defense for your behavior.  :  5. The purpose of your life is YOUR choice.   True. God did not make us robots or predestine the course of our Life.  We are predestined to be a royal priesthood and in harmony with His Will unless we CHOOSE to reject Him.   There will always be people. They will always have greed and lust which makes a perfect world impossible. This by Adam's Choice.  God imprinted us with His emotions and His image.  Just as He had anger, jealousy, love,  we have this also.  Becasue you can't control your hormones and I can't stay away from a Big Mac means we make the CHOICE.  By your statement you are admitting your alternate lifestyle is a CHOICE.  I am glad you have finally admitted this.  God advises us and sometimes corrects us but always allows us to make the CHOICE to follow him.  We are His chosen people.   :  4. Put some money in the collection  : plate...I don't feel like working this week.   I pray for you almost daily Bzz.  This is getting to be a full time job.  Your work is never work if you love it though.    Because it doesn't pay well on earth I will remind you that if you would just submit to God and go to church and learn about the God you hate so much it would be a lot easier on both of us.  :  3. Your highest service is to YOURSELF.   The submission to God's Will is the ultimate goal.  Self makes you weak.  You make alternate CHOICES that set you apart from God and His Holy will.  To live His Life you must Loose yours.  To be in His Will you must Loose yours.   Self Loosers are the winners.  :  2. The REAL miracle is that so many people  : really believe all of this magical stuff.   God's teachings reject magic as an evil force under the influence of darkness.  God is God.  The Great I AM.    :  1. Think for YOURSELF.   If you thought for yourself and paid attention to what God was telling you, you would see you need to think for yourself and learn.  Learn about the God who created you and loves you.

      Last night's storm was loud, bright!   Rain fell, people were moved to stop their normal routine and consider our God and his great and mighty power.   Some lost cable (I did) and had to rest without the incessant pounding of images and voices wanting to direct ro control your life.  Alone with your own thoughts and God can be so dangerous and introspective.  Some lost power.  Alone in the darkness.  Not alone, God is still with us.  Now we see him and respect him and stand in awe of his greatness.  And in the day after,  clean air full of new possibilities. In nature and in our minds.  Please be in prayer for Claire Tatum who is now in St Jude in Memphis undergoing chemo for cancer.  Her church, Fortville Christian is collecting funds for the family.

       Really enjoyed Michael W Smith , MercyMe , and David Crowder Band    They put us cripples in the same area.  My friend Neil couldn't sit in a  regular chair and I couldn't get down the aisle.    We sat immediately next to this lady and her husband through the whole concert. SHe had the SPirit and was enjoying the concert but not bothering anyone.    Jennifer and I watched the stares she got from the people walking by who didn't have the compassion or understanding to see this for what it was.  We liked seeing the bug eyes.    Years ago this would have been me.  What are you doin lady?  Sit down and let us see the show.    In a wheel chair and she stood the whole time we were there with her cane.  We gave her and her friend glowsticks.    This was our 10 year anniversary of our first date. I was able to get Jennifer a rose.    God Bless

        This is a note to those who have been helping my family.  When we moved to Indianapolis years ago Jennifer wanted to make friends with everyone in our apartment complex in Indianapolis.  She said she knew everybody in Oakland City so she thought people were the same here.  Thinking like that could get her killed.    When we lived in Indianapolis we discovered there are many people who move to big cities to loose themselves.  In small towns everyone knows everybody...and their troubles.  Good fodder for gossip.    So when we moved from Indianpolis to Greenfield we had made friends but not many friends.    The parable of the Pool    Many people in the pool. Some in deep and some in shallow. Never ask someone in the shallow end to save your life if you're in the deep end.  You draw your conclusions of the meaning.    Here we have developed many friends in the deep end of the pool.  People that would do almost anything for us.    It takes great submission to be able to let people help you.  Our family was self made.  My dad didn't take anything from anyone and had a strong work ethic.  He still has ideas about people taking advantage of workers.    Dad's philosophy worked well while I was physically able to take care of myself.  His guidance still helps me set my aim.  His ethics are not in question.      I have learned that being a slug when you can work isn't right but it has taken some time with my background to accept I can't do what I used to do.     I nearly killed myself trying to do be what my dad was and nearly killed myself.    The many types of Christians including 1) Pew Warmers; 2) Ego for Christ; 3) Works will get me to heaven; and today's discussion 4) Martyr for Christ, not accepting Grace and Mercy.    Many people do this in their relationship with Christ.  They want to die on their own cross to be placed along side Christ.  When Martyr is part of your name you look at this close.  They want to do all the works of Christ to get to heaven.    How far can you get on this path before burnout...or death? If you realize that Mercy and Grace get you to heaven then you can do the works without trying to outdo Christ.    Submission to His Will is hard.  Our friends help us in many ways and this is hard to accept.  Some people will not accept help.  Food stamps, assistance,  "welfare" are things that my family never used.    Let me thank some people:    Jennifer.  Without you I would already be gone.  My life started when I met you.  Your faith rescued mine.  Mad at God, mad at life.  I have a death sentance with my health and know it but am fighting the good fight. All this is easy with you to help...or at least easier.    Dale and Kevin.  God knows hwere you came from at the right time.  My health and Jennifer's lack of time because she babysits me haven't left us time for the things you guys ahve done.    Pat, Joyce, Keith, Lauren.  Helps of amny natures and all the time. Hate to ask but glad you can help.    Ann and John.  John worked on the radio station transmiter last week when Jennifer was out of town.  Ann has saved us many times.    Toby and Nancy.  Thank you for loving us and loving God and donating your help when things are so bleak in some ways.    Chris and Tina.  Just having someone to talk with helps a lot.      Bob Tannehill.  Raising the bar on your outlook.  Don & Liz, Ed and Cindy, Greg and Janet, Donna and her grass skirt and many others.  Curt, Mark, Chris, Nadine, Eric, Gary, Mark, Mark,  Ned,  Bob and Jan, Neil and Amy, Moe, Eric, and forgive me if you aren't here.  One of the things I miss most is my clear mind and superb memory.  If I ask you who you are it isn't an insult.  I either can't see you well enough to know or have forgotten for a moment. This is my latest gift and I thank you for accepting it.    I went to jail tonight with Dale and Andy from Body Of Christ (those holyrollers) and had a great time in Christ...AND THEY LET ME OUT AFTER IT WAS OVER!!!!    When I came home my 5 year old asked me if I was scared?  I told her I was but that I was home now and that was all that mattered....    Thank You for my many blessings.    Life is scary, but not living life is accepting fear and letting it control your life.      Thank You Father for allowing us to expereince this.    Love to my Brothers and Sisters in Christ.

        Blessings to you and your family.  God promised us he would never leave us or forsake us.  A promise and a bond with us.    Knowing this makes some of life's challenges easier to handle.    Met with IU this week.  Have been soaking it in.    I have another doctor to meet and a workup to get before I can get a pancreas and kidney.  The transplant doctor seems to think this will happen.    I have 3 people willing to give me one of their kidneys. While I do not qualify for a cadaver kidney I qualify for a donor kidney if I find the donor.  My kidneys are going bad but there are people with kidneys in worse shape than mine.    If I can get a pancreas and try it out, we will see what happens to my kidneys.  The anti rejection drugs typically will kill a bad kidney.  The doctor says it will most likely kill the kidneys.    Jennifer says she wants to be checked for donor possibility first.  I have mixed feeligns about this.  We also have other people who are willing to donate.    This can be a downer for some people reading but for me it is exciting that I ahve a chance to extend my life and live a "normal" length of time.  70, 80 years?      At 43 I am past middle age.  By my health I am at the end of my life.  To have a few more eyars is exciting.  I am prepared to leave this world but not yet ready. His will is my deciding factor.    Have a Good God Day!  Join us at the 4H Fairgrounds for the WJCF outreach.

        This note from Donna's blogsite :  I am worried about Marty Hensley. He doesn't post as much any more. I pray he is laughing himself to health and wellness. He wrote how he laughed and laughed when he saw my barn with WJCF 88.1 on it. He liked it so much he came back and saw it a second time. Maybe he will put the picture up on the wall at the radio station so he can see it all the time. Laughter does the body good like a medicine and a whole lot cheaper too! I do need to warn Marty about allowing Dale and Kevin have a radio show on Thurs. nights from 6pm - 8pm. I believe they have escaped from that same mental ward. I will grab the white jacket that I have and we will round them up together and take them back where they belong.     I have been dealing with health issues much to my own objection.  Since this is the only thing doing lately I have been hesitant to write any more.  I have been trying to read lately to see what's up.    Despite the problems I have I can say I still love my wife Jennifer, my children (even the one still finding herself), my family, and my friends.  This is one of the things that keeps me alive.    The other thing keeping me active and alive is the volunteer work I can do through the radio station. I don't feel I am a big part of the radio station but it is a big part of me.  The farther along I get the less I can do and it takes me longer to do.  Others do much more than I do and it bothers me Jennifer can't rely on me for more.      I want to do more but can't.    I keep hearing about God's Will and being submissive to it, allowing Him to direct your life.  I'm living it now.     My hope is in believing that what little I do is accomplishing something.    I talk to IU today about transplants.  I will find out if this is a dream or reality, and what it takes.  Doctor visits left and right have left me not wanting to go to a doctor real soon.    My Hemoglobin levels are low.  Not enough for a transfusion yet but getting there.  This may account for my lack of energy, I am told.  This is nothign new as this has happened before many years ago. They can't find out why though. May be related to kidney function they say now.  But this wasn't kidney related years ago???    Rather than make this a downer I have to trust God has a purpose for me to go through this rather than die and be done with it.  Some days the latter would be easier.  As my old guide used to say, "If it was easy women and kids would be doing it...."  No offense to any women , especially now that I have been in the care of my wife all this time.    You learn much about someone's charachter when they have to support you and take care of you because you can't.  I can still joke about her PMS without gettign thrown out.  I can still joke about her driving and suggest I can do a better job even though I can't see to drive.  Her former attitude and charachter have not changed for the worse.  If anything she is more tolerantand more understanding.    God's blessings on you and on your family.  May you lve life to the fullest for God.

      Much to say.  I have been "quiet" this week.  The peace of the Lord be with you.  Lift up your hearts to the Lord.  I have been blessed to be able to spend time with my children this week, and today.  Mom was at work and the kids are helping me clean out the basement. (I watch them clean the basement)  This usually involves more playing than cleaning.  This is okay too.  Brink is getting big.  He does most fo the work with Brook and Asa watching.  Seeing his attitude and his actions make me aware I need to be more like God because Brink copies everything I do.  Children learn like McCaws.  We had a McCaw at the house today.  The kids were excited.  We learned from Christine, its owner, that they learn some words quickly, and this can lead to problems if they need to change owners!  It is difficult to unlearn a bad word.  Same as our children.  We are so careful around Brink and the other kids.  Television, who they hang out with, my older son.......  Brink came in the other day because someone had said the "S"word....stupid.  Sometimes someone will say the "D" word...dumb.  Wonder how long these hurtful words will be the worst they hear?  Health update-  Monday - Hospital with breathing difficulty.  Thought it might be water in the lungs.  Ankles have been swollen about three times their normal size.  No one knows why.  Kidneys?  Possibly.  Laser surgery on left eye.  Doctor says any eyesight I have left may not be here long if they can't get a handle on the kidney problem.   Kidney options - dialysis, new kidney.  Wish me God Luck I see the transplant guru this week,  As we celebrate our freedom , remember Freedom isn't free. Christ paid the ultimate sacrifiece for our freedom.  Men and women paid with their lives so we can enjoy a country where we have freedom to worship God.  More I want to say.  God Bless you and keep you.

      Lack of posts have been related to a lack of energy not motivation.  Got to spend today with the kids.  We are working together to clean up our basement.  basement to become playroom and storage if we can get the water problem fixed.  No standing water, just leaking water from small holes.  What to expect from a house built in 1895?  Shot off minimal big boom fireworks today.  Working on this tomorrow too. Really have a blast watching the kids experience this.    A friend hooked up a long wire antenna for my amateur radio rig that covers the shortwave band.  I got to work 1 station on a rig and antenna I ahve had for three years but haven't been able to assemble the equipment for. This is in the basement.  Can play radio, see the kids, and tinker.  What can be better?  Monday of this last week was spent at the hospital.  I can't breathe normally.  Pressure in my chest.  Doctor says it could be gas or upset stomach.  My argument that upset stomach doesn't last a week, now two, had no impact.  I am taking medicine to keep my stomache calm because of my meds now.  Concern was that I had water on the lungs as I have been retainign water...in addition to being fat also.  They kept asking me how much I smoked or when I stopped.  I have never smoked by the way. Rabidly anti smoking.  When they ask me if I want a smoking or non smoking seat I always say non stinking.  I have scarring from Histoplasmosis. At this point no set treatment for what is happening.  My Cpap machine helps me breathe at night.  I hear it struggle to push air into my lungs.  I'm not sure it is keeping up.  Eye specialist says what sight I have left is not going to be here long unless something happens soon. Thank God for windows accessibility....Had laser surgery (again) on left eye. Bllod vessels keep bleeding fluid into the eyeball.  Kidneys are failing and I have started EPO shots for stimulation of blood cells.  Used for cancer patients.  Funny thing, they have done so many tests on me.  In 1994 they did a series of tests including aids and other diseases and found odd results but no diagnosis.  Bone marrow draw was a treat too. Fortunately I don't have aids but many of the problems including energy and affects are similar.    They believe what I have is genetic but have been somewaht unsure of the exact nature.  Blood sugar is under control so why are my kidneys failing????    I am having some additional testing done.  Prayer please.  I am reminded of the apostles trials after Christ gave them their directives.  This life while painful is a short journey. We are like a whisper, only here for a short time.  A flower quickly fading.  This life is a walk in the park.  Brothers and sisters please pray for me.  Highlight of today - a barn at 600E and 100N.  I need to find out how many tickets Donna needs to Michael W SMith. Radio contest asked for signs for WJCF.  Donna had her barn painted.  I was driven by Friday and laughed and laughed, even though I had seen pictures.  Jennifer drove by with me Saturday.  Sharing just these little , insignificant, wouldn't trade for the world, moments with family and friends makes life worth living.  Choose Life that you might live , the life that He gives, He gives you forever.
