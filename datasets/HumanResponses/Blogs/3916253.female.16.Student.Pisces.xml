      Hey yall! Its really early here and I should be asleep but I'm just a bit wired up. I just got back from my friend Anges house. We had a blast. Well let me backtrack. I don't really remember Tuesday, I think I just chilled and stuff. Well since today is technically Thursday all this stuff that went on happened yesterday. So anyway I went to summer school like always. I was late but nothing I could about it. Came home and chilled for a while. I wanted to go to sleep but I got distracted and I didn't want to mess up my hair if I was to go down to Shoprite and hand in my application. So I was chilling and my friend Ange calls. I had called her the night before but she didn't get back to me till today but I had already gotten things straightened out. So she came online and we was talking and she was like u wanna come hang but she had to go to church @ 7 and then we would go back to her house. First I had to go drop off my application and it wasn't as bad as I thought. The lady took my application and she seemed nice so we'll see what happens. Well then I went over my friends and I helped her cook supper (lol) her ma was at work and her dad was mowing so she was making dinner blah blah anyways. After that we went to her church. They have Wednesday night mass. It was ok I was just really tired cause I only got like 4 hours of sleep from the night before so I was almost falling asleep. :X After that a bunch of us was hanging out in the parking lot. It looked like we were gonna get a really bad storm but we ended up not getting much at all. So we hung out there for a while, it was pretty cool. The guys are really funny so we were all joking around with each other and stuff. So then we went back to Anges (stopping for ice cream first) and Ange Allison and me hung out. We were cracking up. We created a slide show bout this guy from the church. It is totally not to be bashing him at all, we think hes awesome, but we were just fooling around. So I didn't leave till like 12:15 (this is AM and in my other post its AM I think just to clarify) or later. Not quite sure. But anyways I had a lot of fun "yesterday" and I had to write it down. Now im gonna hopefully go to sleep and be on time for summer school tomorrow. Who knows. Oh and excuse my spelling errors and the cat pic. I'm still playing around with this thing. Check ya later.

      Hello whoever is reading this. Yea this is my first post so it wont be much. My life isn't the most exciting thing in the world so don't plan to be glued to your seat reading. :D So I'll summarize what's going on with me. For lil more than 2 weeks I have to go to summer school. It started last Tuesday and ends next Wednesday. Its not that bad. The people are ok and it does get me up in the mornings. I usually sleep late during the summer and I don't like sleeping late sometimes. Miss too much during the day. Anyways lets see. Yesterday Me and my friends met at Shoprite cause our friend Cat(that's what we call her) just started working there and she wanted us to visit and see her bag our stuff lol. Yea she's a bagger. I might work there too I'll have to see. Two of my other friends are applying there too but that and my ex is working there sort of makes me not want to. Sometimes I don't like to go with the crowd. But I guess I'll put in an application and see what happens. So anyway we walked there and tried not to make a scence in the store. Me and Ange took some free cookies and Jamie and Sharon were like whaa? Lol, we acted like such good adults lol thatz hard for Jamie. :P Then went to the check out lane. I bought some cat food and batteries lol. My friend Ange bought some clips. Jamie and Sharon were there two but they broke lol. Sharon has a job at The Lake but she doesn't want to spend her money. When I was getting my bags from Cat and ange was paying for her stuff Jamie just like jumps up to cat and is like HEY GHETTOLICOUS! Lol I was like OMG and Cat looked all embrassed. Jamie is just like what? Lol, So after that we all went home (Ange had to get her hair cut) and then Ange came back over and left at like midnight. It was funny. Lots of fun with the friends even though it didnt seem it. One of those had to be there. :P So anyways went to summer school this morning, nothing too big happened. Now I'm just sitting here with it raining outside and my mix CD going. I'm getting tired lol. So Jamie might get her second holes done today and I might go. That should be fun. :P So, I think that's it for now. Check ya later.
