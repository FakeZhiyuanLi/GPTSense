						   Forest Clearing 26th August 1668 – 3 hours past meridian 	Bartholomew raised a clenched fist, a signal to halt. He had found a perfect spot to ambush Jebediah’s captors. Then came the distant rumble of dozens of foot soldiers marching. The boys shivered in terror. Bartholomew gave them instructions to fire at the men on horseback first – the officers.  	An officer of the British Empire rode at the head of his men. They had just captured a member of the opposing army and were leading him back to camp to gain information. He was prepared to use any means. Suddenly, a shot rang out in the forest. The officer never knew what hit him. He felt a searing pain through his abdomen; fresh blood flowed forth from his mouth. Within seconds, he fell off his mount, dead. The convoy was thrown into confusion. The Wallace boys zeroed in on the officers and fired. Both fell off their horses, lifeless. The soldiers attention was turned towards the trees where smoked had first emerged. They commenced firing. The Wallaces ducked in lieu of the flying splinters of wood where the British shells had been fired. As the dense vegetation obscured visibility, the redcoats were firing at whatever caught their attention. But the Wallaces precise firing trimmed and thinned the ranks considerably. When eldest Wallace decided it was the ripe time he motioned for the boys to cover him, while he ventured into the enemies’ ranks and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.  	The British advanced towards Bartholomew and tried to bring him down using their bayonets. He rushed forward in a semi-crazed state, wielding his battleaxe like a drunkard, clumsy yet forceful. Each stroke of his arm caught a soldier and brought him down. Their ranks yet thinned again under the firing of rifles and the power of Bartholomew’s sword arm. Only a small band of men was left, Bartholomew counted eight bruised and fatigued men. They ran forward each crying “ For the King and England!!” They managed to wound the drained warrior that had murdered so many of their comrades. With renewed vivacity, Bartholomew rushed forward and brought down the remainder of the soldiers. One man stood against him, the officer that ordered the torching of his house. He whimpered in trepidation as Bartholomew slowly yet surely inched his way towards him. Against this bloodthirsty and revenge crazed assailant, he fled. Bartholomew did not move to chase. Instead, he clasped the battleaxe in both hands and brought it high over his head. With a single fluid motion, he flung the weapon. The battleaxe caught the coward square between his shoulders, and what came was a sickening sound of tearing sinews. He opened his mouth to scream, but all that was heard were frantic gasps of air. Bartholomew lunged forward to retrieve that lethal blade from the fatally wounded officer. In a pool of his own blood, the sergeant gasped for breath knowing he was within Death’s reach. The clearing was now bereft of any life, except for the Wallaces and the dying officer. Rage coursed through Bartholomew’ soul, at the spur of the moment, he hacked at the dying sergeant relentlessly, not stopping until he was reminded of the presence of the younger Wallace boys. His eyes were dazed by this encounter. Soft grunts sounded from underneath a dead horse. As the Wallaces approached the dead mount a pair of hands were flailing aimlessly. Engrossed with this killing spree, the Wallaces had forgotten their aim of this ambush. With great effort, they managed to shift the mangled carcass of the animal. Lying underneath were two men – Jebediah and another soldier that had blood streaming from his temple. Before he could even reach for his battleaxe, the soldier fled in terror. Martin raised his already cocked rifle to fire, but Bartholomew pushed his musket down. “ Let him go. Let him know that I am not to be trifled with.” Bartholomew slowly raised his son to his feet, both men, drain of whatever energy that they possessed. They trudged towards the carriage that was the only structure that stood on the scene of carnage. They headed towards Aunt Charlotte’s abode.

						   Home 25th August 1668 – High Noon 	It had been just over a year when Jebediah left, in service for the army. He had secretly inked his name, that fateful day when his father’s attention was diverted. A few days later, he had sneaked out of the house after nightfall to rendezvous with his friends, before leaving for the army.  Home 25th August 1668 - Dusk 	The distant yet distinct booms of the cannons of rivaling armies sounded throughout the land. The family of Wallaces huddled together at the dinner table, praying hard that the danger would pass over them. A soft, insignificant dragging came across the hallway. A wounded soldier had just entered their dwelling. “Stop where you are, drop your weapons!” Bartholomew hissed. The intruder turned around, his features so striking, and familiar. He collapsed into Bartholomew’s arms --- Jebediah had finally returned. He was carried to the hall where he was laid down. Every step they took caused Jebediah to writhe in pain. A bullet lodged in his midsection caused him much agony. In the process of removing the bullet, he soon fell unconscious. He was feared dead, but Bartholomew reassured the rest that he was still very much alive.  	From the grass verge emerged scores of men clad in red. Men in blue rushed forward to the clearing. The first shot rang out, the first man fell. Thus beginning a nightmare not known to many. Shortly, into the battle, cannons were rolled in to view. The screams of agony sounded out as men were hit by flying shrapnel. Some fell to their very own colleagues shots. The battlefield soon turned into a scene of carnage. The firing soon ceased. Both factions formed into a single row. At a cry, both lines charged, and clashed. This battle carried on till daybreak.  Home 26th August 1668 – Dawn 	Jebediah awoke with a start. He studied his milieu, he was in a place so foreign yet familiar place --- His father’s study. The wounded soldier mustered enough strength to drag himself across the floor. Muffled groans brought his attention to the porch where numerous mortally wounded soldiers of both factions were lain down to await Death. Scores of wounded soldiers, some shot in the legs, arms and other body parts that were not life-threatening lay on the grass. A dozen familiar thoughts and faces flooded his mind. His kin were tending to the wounded, and comforting the dying ones. His father turned to him and they embraced. The rest of the family temporarily left their duties at hand to welcome Jebediah home. But their family reunion was not to last. In the distance, a band of redcoats marched briskly towards their home. Their leader, a sergeant in his early thirties addressed Bartholomew. “I must show you utmost gratitude for giving His Majesty’s men such hospitality. We are indebted to you…” Before he had finished his sentence a clear voice broke through the clearing, “ Consider that debt over ridden! You have indeed shown hospitality towards MY men, and have nursed their injuries, but I believe you house a traitor!” A small, armed calvary emerged, at their head, a sinister looking lieutenant. He too, like the mayor, had a pair of sky-blue pupils, which were piercing. “It is to my knowledge that a member of your own army, a postal officer broke through our ranks and ran in this direction, in search, possibly, of refuge.” He paused, allowing his words to sink in before continuing. “I shall now warrant a search of every inch of your property, to find this impudent mortal.” Bartholomew made a move to object. But was soon overcome some of the redcoats. Jebediah was shooed back into the study just moments before the redcoats had arrived. He had long fell in a sound slumber when the calvary arrived. He was roused from his sleep by a pair of rough hands that were constantly tugging at his coat. As he opened his eyes, what he saw shocked him…   	Within minutes, he was dragged before the lieutenant and thrown to his knees. In his cold and sinister voice, he began to speak. “Ah! I see before me this treacherous boy; trying as hard he would to send valuable information to his commander. Sadly, I will not allow this.” He motioned for an officer and whispered something in his ear. The officer moved towards Jebediah and barked at him to move. Bartholoew broke free of the soldiers’ grasp and made a move to shield his son. Due to nursing the wounded soldiers through the long night, he was taxed, he was soon over powered again. His son was attached at the wrists to the horse of the lieutenant. The sergeant that had arrived earlier could only look on in pity as all these took place. As the lieutenant began to leave, he mumbled in apology to Bartholomew. Another of the lieutenants stepped forward and ordered for the American soldiers to be shot. The soldiers could only whimper in cowardice, before their last breath allowed them to cry in pain as English bullets tore through their sinews. The wounded redcoats were taken away. A group of redcoats emerged with torches. What Bartholomew had feared now came true. At an order the torches were flung into the house and soon the entire house was ablaze. At the spur of the moment, Thomas, the second Wallace son rushed forward and sliced the rope that bonded Jebediah’s wrists. Thomas realized his error, but it was too late…The lieutenant whirled around, pistols already loaded and fired twice in succession.  	Bartholomew broke free and ran towards his son. He cradled him and comforted him knowing that only Death awaited him. Jebediah was once again captured and lead away. Without saying a word, Thomas’s face became a deathly pale, and passed on into death. When the Englishmen had rode out of sight, Bartholomew’s strength surged into body, coursing through his veins and empowering him with might. Filled with anguish, he raced towards his bedroom. He screeched to a halt in front of his chest of belongings so long forgotten. He opened it, and the sight that greeted brought back many memories. No time for that now, he shook the thoughts out of his mind. He pulled out every weapon and firearm he could find.   	From the blazing inferno emerged a terrible sight. Bartholomew was armed to his teeth. With rifles, machetes, pistols, and his beloved Cherokee Battleaxe. His eyes, ablaze, with a fury long forgotten to this realm. He distributed the weapons to his two remaining son, Samuel and Martin. He turned to his housemaid Abigail; “Bring the girls to Charlotte’s, and seek refuge. We’ll come later.” Without so much as a backward glance, he and the boys sped off, hot on the heels of the British convoy that held his dear son captive.

						   The Wallace children threw their last glance towards their home. The first time they would be away from their dwelling. At last the carriages set of at a trot towards the town, a journey that would last for 2 days.  Town Hall 16 August 1667 - Dawn Order! Order!” finally, the ruffled crowd agreed to settle down. The man presiding over the debate was the Mayor Blake, a tough, battle scarred veteran of the war. Armed with a pair of piercing eyes, the man’s gaze was enough to send shivers down one’s spine. “I have called upon you, honorable citizens, to discuss the advance of the English troops. For the past few months they have been moving up North, and will soon reach our settlement.” He paused, his facial expressions contorted into a look of mock horror. “And every thing we hold dear to will be annihilated, in one fell swoop.”  The crowd gathered in the hall broke into a myriad of arguments. The mayor raised a hand, signaling for silence. It was a while before silence fell upon the crowd. “I will now have Colonel Christopher present his case”. A man in his late thirties stood up, clad in full military attire. His eyes were alert, darting from each side of the hall to the next, studying each man’s faces. After a long silence he began to speak. “As you have been told, the English forces will soon be closing in on our town. I stand here in hopes of persuading the majority of the able bodied males, if not all, into joining the army and beating the redcoats of our soil!” Once again the men in the hall erupted, questioning and bickering about this sudden move.  Throughout this lengthy discussion, one man sat still listening to each word, each sentence uttered. Just when the town hall was about to explode into a brawl, he stood up. The townsmen immediately silenced themselves in reverence to this respected war veteran. This man --- Bartholomew Wallace.  Bartholomew Wallace, a great warrior earned his reputation as a ruthless killing machine when the French and the Cherokees tried to raid Fort Charles. The soldiers residing within the fort put up a fierce retaliation, cutting down many French and Cherokees alike. They had won, but at the expense of many lives. He began to speak, “ What good is a tyrant 3000 miles away, to 3000 tyrant 1 mile away.” The hall broke into sniggers. “What good is it if we put up a resistance. Yes, we may win, but at what cost? You people may wish to participate and bring down a few Englishmen, but I will keep my family out of this violence!” Upon hearing that declaration, his eldest son, Jebediah, stormed out the hall. It was a known fact that he wanted so badly to enlist into the army and bask in the glory of eliminating the English, that was threatening to turn this vast land of freedom into a colony.  At long last, the meeting drew to a close. Bartholomew was first to leave. Upon reaching the threshold, orderly lines of young men came into his view. Scores of those young men eagerly waiting to grasp that quill in the hands, and write their on the parchment, to enlist into the army.  Just moments from inking his name, an ominous shadow was cast over Jebediah. A rough pair of hands lifted him up and shook him hard, “ You will not leave this family, and neither will you fight against this English tyrant!” Jebediah felt the happiness draw out of him instantaneously.                                                                          To Be Continued.....

						   TIGER, tiger, burning bright  In the forests of the night,  What immortal hand or eye  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?   In what distant deeps or skies  Burnt the fire of thine eyes?  On what wings dare he aspire?  What the hand dare seize the fire?   And what shoulder and what art  Could twist the sinews of thy heart?  And when thy heart began to beat,  What dread hand and what dread feet?   What the hammer? what the chain?  In what furnace was thy brain?  What the anvil? What dread grasp  Dare its deadly terrors clasp?   When the stars threw down their spears,  And water'd heaven with their tears,  Did He smile His work to see?  Did He who made the lamb make thee?   Tiger, tiger, burning bright  In the forests of the night,  What immortal hand or eye  Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

						   Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. `'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door - Only this, and nothing more.'  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore - For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore - Nameless here for evermore.  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating `'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door - Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; - This it is, and nothing more,'  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, `Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; - Darkness there, and nothing more.  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!' This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!' Merely this and nothing more.  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. `Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore - Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; - 'Tis the wind and nothing more!'  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door - Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door - Perched, and sat, and nothing more.  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, `Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven. Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore - Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!' Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door - Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as `Nevermore.'  But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only, That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered - Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before - On the morrow will he leave me, as my hopes have flown before.' Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, `Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store, Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore - Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore Of "Never-nevermore."'  But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore - What this grim, ungainly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet violet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore!  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. `Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!' Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'  `Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! - Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted - On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore - Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!' Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'  `Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore - Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore - Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore?' Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'  `Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting - `Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!' Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'  And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted - nevermore!
