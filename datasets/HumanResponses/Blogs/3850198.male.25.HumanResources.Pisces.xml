      Hmm, maybe this is a waste of a post.  Not sure if I can think of much to say.  I guess I'll just go with the flow and see what happens.    I'm really enjoying XM radio.  I made my first commute to work today with it in and enjoyed every minute of it.  Sound quality is fantastic.  It only cut out once when I got downtown and went between the tallest of the buildings.  It was only a second or 2 anyway.  I even took a ride tonight for now reason other than to listen to music a bit more.  I can't wait for my home kit to arrive so I can listen to XM in the house.  Yikes, not doing so good.  Already at a stopping point. Let's see...  I don't know, there's only so much you can say about yourself.  Nothing's really new at work.  I'm pretty busy dealing with all this shit for a compensation analysis of our pay structure by a consulting firm--riveting blog story, I know.  Maybe I'll start a story or something in a separate blog.  I think this one may have died already.

      I love my job, don't get me wrong.  But what pisses me off about my boss is the terrible tasks she delegates on to me.  For example: I had a voicemail message from her today asking me to call the Food Service within the company to decrease the portions on the trail mix that is delivered to the benefits comitee from 45 to 30..... o.o  Item 2, she asks me to call Sr VP's and Executive VP's and Chief officers of a handful of companies to check references on a consulting firm.  (talk about going to extremes.)  Item 3, she asks me to call an employee and set up a time that is convenient for her to meet with my boss--in other words she wanted me to schedule an appointment for her.  Mind you--I am not her secretary.  Ok, I'll stop with the bitching, after all it'a a great place to work.  Yesterday every employee in the organization got an "employee thank-you" bonus of $200--it was pretty sweet.  Oh, also, I received my XM "Roady 2" in the mail today and put that in my car.  I love it already, can't wait for the commute to work tomorrow.  I'd highly recommend to anyone use the same internet site I ordered from. XMfanstore.com  They got my order to me 1 day after I ordered it and have great customer service.  They also get items exclusively for a while when things are new--such as the Roady 2 is.  Hmm, that last sentence was terrible english but I'm not sure how to correct it.  Just note that it wasn't on purpose.  Ok, that's all for now, gotta take a shower. Peace out Blog. (I'd never use "peace out" in a sentence in real life) =)

      Hmm, I thought this thing would lose its appeal after a nights sleep but I still feel like typing in this blog.  Ok, so where did I leave off?  Oh, I think it was talking about my love life.  My girlfriend is great for the following reasons from what I can gather:  she's cute, she loves me, she's well liked, caring, generous and has nice tits.  The things I don't like about her are as follows:  she's a neat freak to the point of obsession, she has to be in controll at all times including bossing me around, she has a serious temper, and she's a spoiled brat that has to get her way.  The bad qualities I've come to realize more over the past few months as I've met a girl (mentioned in last post) at work that has really opened my eyes.  I'd better start from the beginning--I had no attraction to this girl whatsoever.  She was slightly heavy, seemed very.....what's the word I'm looking for...old-like or old-acting.  That sounded stupid. Anyway, I had a couple really cool conversations with her finding that we had quite a bit in common. (Actually, much more that my current girlfriend.)  But then one night I had a really wierd dream about her where we were laying on the floor somewhere side by side and turned to each other and started kissing.  It wasn't a wet dream or anything but I woke up and couldn't stop thinking of this perfect kiss.  It sounds stupid but since that dream I've been completely infatuated with this woman.  I find her more attractive each day and think she's one of the most intelligent people I've ever met.  So, that's the situation.  I'm living with a girl that I can't bring myself to marry and can't stop fantisizing about a girl I shouldn't be attracted to (or should I?)  To add to this I've had a less than perfect track record with women.  The plot goes something like...I'm attracted to a girl because she seems in to me, we date for a bit, we have sex, I get sick of her and end up dumping her soon after.  From an outsider's view it looks like I was just with her to sleep with her but in reality I'm really not trying to repeat this pattern.  I just happened to, in the past, get sick of girls quite quickly.  I'm affraid that if something did develop between me and this girl at work I'd just fuck it up and have to see her everyday for the rest of my career there.  Eh, I'm kind of dissatisfied with this blog post.  I'm gonna try to keep it lighter from now on.  I feel like i'm talking to a shrink.  Seems a little crazy.

      A new addiction already perhaps?  Too early to tell.  But I still have another hour or so before I usually get sleepy and with so much free time on my hands...might as well post another entry.  I'm streaming some internet radio broadcast through winamp.  I'm loving streaming internet radio lately and do it for most of the day at work too.  I think that's part of the reason for my purchasing XM (see last post)  Ok, so a little bit more about me.  I'm 25, recent college grad, have a great job working for a great company, and live with my girlfriend in a townhouse in the same town as the college I attended.  We also have a pet tortoise named Steven.  I'll have to post a pic of him sometime.  Random business Idea--Why hasn't anyone developed a beer/liquor delivery service?  The idea is genius--when you really want more to drink you're usually 2 sheets to the wind.  If a delivery service were available you wouldn't  have  to drive on that beer run.  The store could charge a premium price--let's face it when you're drunk you'll pay a little extra for stuff anyway.  It would all be legal because the merchandise would all be unopened and the driver would be over 21 and instructed to check ID of the person paying.  Cops would be happy because it would get drunk drivers off the road.    I think this came to me living in a college town--always trying to decide which of my friends were the "least drunk" to get more drinks.  Anyway, enough random business thoughts.  How about a kanundrum i'm currently in with my personal life.  ::pause for just a second, the last paragraph made me thirsty for a beer::  ahh, better.  The situation is this--I've recently been thinking, am I really happy with my life--specifically my love life.  The thing that made me start thinking about this issue was meeting someone at work.  She's everything my girlfriend is not which I would have thought would have made her unattractive to me but the complete opposite has happened and I find myself thinking about her continuously.    Eh, this is getting long again...although, I'm new at this so how do I know how long it's supposed to be?  Oh well, we'll continue this later.

      Ok, I was randomly sent off on a tangent while downloading some spoof Office Space video when I saw  a banner ad for this site.  I've never kept a blog before but was kinda tempted to try it out...so here it goes, my first Blog entry.  I'm not sure about how much detail I'm going to go into on my first entry.  After all, I've never done this before and I don't know how public or private this thing really is.  So I'll probably be a little guarded with giving out too much personal info.    I guess I would describe myself as sort of a nerd in disguise.  By "in disguise" i mean that on the outside I (well, think anyway) appear to be an upstanding decent-looking guy that probably had tons of friends and so on...  In reality I enjoy video games to a point of addiction and coincidentally I've forced myself to cut back playing recently and I'm going throgh withdrawls.  I was sticking mainly to online role-playing type games which suck you in as it is and could easily spend 20 hours of a weekend playing.  I'd also usually spend a minimum of 3 hours every night too leaving my girlfriend a little upset.  I'm just kind of randomly exploring the internet most nights now.  I post alot on a gaming forum which...is sort of stupid and probably tempts me to return to my old ways.  Another forum I've been visiting a lot the last couple nights is an xmradio fansite (is that nerdy too?).  I just ordered an XM satellite unit over the weekend and I'm stoked about finally having techno music on my car radio again.  My previous favorite radio station was converted to a 100% Spanish station.  Well, this is getting long, maybe I'll cut it here and write some more tomorrow after work.  Nite blog
